1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,120
The Joe Rogan experience.
Well,

2
00:00:03,121 --> 00:00:07,470
I think people can develop these patterns
of behavior that are destructive with

3
00:00:07,471 --> 00:00:10,300
anything, whether it's with alcohol
or cannabis or you know, yes,

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,970
sex or anything people get,
they get in ruts, know.

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,180
It doesn't mean that the cannabis is bad
as means that you are on a bad mental

6
00:00:18,181 --> 00:00:20,610
path. Yes, exactly. I mean,

7
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:23,490
I'm not encouraging it for everybody
because some people are genuinely

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,700
biologically it doesn't jive
with them. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

9
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,840
The fundamental thing is we as adult
human beings need to take responsibility

10
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:35,640
for our own lives and our own decisions
and we need not have that responsibility

11
00:00:35,641 --> 00:00:37,710
over to governmental institutions,

12
00:00:37,711 --> 00:00:42,090
especially when it concerns something
as intimate and personal as our

13
00:00:42,091 --> 00:00:43,580
consciousness. And, uh,

14
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:48,390
my view is the ancient world had the
right attitude to this kind of thing and

15
00:00:48,391 --> 00:00:50,490
the modern world does not.

16
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,270
And that we can sit down and learn
a lot from the ancient world.

17
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,950
A lot of people ask me, you know, Hancock,
you've been arguing that there's a loss.

18
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,060
There's been a lost civilization in the,
in the, in the human story. But what,

19
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,980
what sort of civilization do you think it
was? Well, one of the things I think is,

20
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,030
was a civilization that use psychedelics.

21
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,320
I think it was a civilization that
emerged from shamanism but did not stay at

22
00:01:13,321 --> 00:01:14,460
the hunter gatherer a stage.

23
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,270
But that took the essence of shamanism
and integrated it into a very different

24
00:01:18,271 --> 00:01:22,080
kind of civilization from our own,
which pursued things in different ways.

25
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,790
A lot of archeologists have said to me,

26
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,420
but we don't find any plastic
bottles from the ice age.

27
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,290
That means there was no
advanced civilization during
the Ice Age. Well, hang on,

28
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,620
maybe an advanced civilization might
have decided never to get involved in

29
00:01:34,621 --> 00:01:35,970
plastic in the first place.

30
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,820
Maybe they would have been a
clear choice not to make plastic.

31
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,160
Maybe they did things in
completely different ways.

32
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:46,770
Maybe they cultivated powers
of the human mind that,

33
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:51,360
uh, we dismiss and regardless,
completely, completely unimportant,

34
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,590
you know, woo woo. Yeah. This is the
thoughts about Egypt, correct. It's about,

35
00:01:55,591 --> 00:01:58,050
about Egypt and about other things.
I mean,

36
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:03,230
the specific example I give is above the
king's chamber in the Great Pyramid are

37
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,620
five further chambers.

38
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:13,040
And these chambers are rushed and flawed
with granite beams that weigh about 70

39
00:02:14,281 --> 00:02:19,281
tons each and there are hundreds of
them and these 70 ton granite beams,

40
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:20,520
which to put in context,

41
00:02:20,521 --> 00:02:25,521
a 70 ton beam is equivalent in weight
to 35 large SUV is these 70 ton granite

42
00:02:26,461 --> 00:02:30,480
beams have been elevated to a height of
more than 350 feet above the ground and

43
00:02:30,481 --> 00:02:34,080
carefully and precisely,
uh, placed in position.

44
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,620
It is very hard for archeologists to
explain how that was done using purely

45
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:43,360
leverage and mechanical
advantage. You can say, oh,

46
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:47,490
and perhaps they built a ramp and,
and, and hold the stones up the ramp.

47
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,100
But then you have to confront
basic laws of physics.

48
00:02:50,101 --> 00:02:55,101
You can't hold us at stone weighing
tens of tons up a slope that exceeds 10

49
00:02:56,251 --> 00:02:58,920
degrees.
Then you start doing the calculation.

50
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,080
How long the ramp do I need with a 10
degree slope to get to 350 feet above the

51
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:07,070
ground? And the answer is
you need a fucking long ramp,

52
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,340
which should still be there because not
that it couldn't have been a sand ramp,

53
00:03:12,341 --> 00:03:14,080
I would've collapsed under
the weight of those stones.

54
00:03:14,081 --> 00:03:16,150
It had to be as massive
as the pyramid itself.

55
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,780
So this begins to seem like
an absurd idea. The, the,

56
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:22,210
the idea that is foisted
on us by archeology,

57
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,360
maybe the idea that they regard as absurd,

58
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:29,320
namely that psychic powers were
cultivated by ancient civilizations,

59
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:32,680
that they could use powers of the human
mind that we have allowed to lapse.

60
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,580
Maybe that idea deserves
further consideration. Um,

61
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,820
we have gone down a path of
leverage and mechanical advantage.

62
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:41,770
We used to relying on machines,

63
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:46,990
but we hear anecdotal reports of people
who have telekinetic powers who can move

64
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:49,900
things with their minds of people
who have telepathic powers on.

65
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:54,640
Our automatic reaction is to just dismiss
all of that because science says it's

66
00:03:54,641 --> 00:03:58,750
impossible. Um, B, B, B,
because a science regardless,

67
00:03:58,751 --> 00:04:03,040
consciousnesses as local to the brain
and doesn't see how it can exert itself

68
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,210
outside of that.

69
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:07,120
But maybe we should open up to those
possibilities that we're dealing with a

70
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:10,900
very different kind of culture that
used techniques that we have allowed to

71
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:13,540
lapse and maybe we could wake
those techniques up again.

72
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:18,570
Maybe the ability of human beings to
do almost superhuman things is resident

73
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,420
within all of us,
but sleeping well.

74
00:04:22,421 --> 00:04:25,540
It's pure speculation that they use
some sort of a telekinetic power,

75
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:26,980
but it's pure speculation,

76
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,770
but it's absolute that they did
something that we don't understand.

77
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,550
If you think about the distance
between us and the construction,

78
00:04:33,551 --> 00:04:37,090
just the modern accepted
construction data, the great pyramid,

79
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,930
it's more than 5,000 years ago or
close to 5,000 years ago to a parent is

80
00:04:40,931 --> 00:04:44,140
supposed to be about 4,500 years
old. Yeah, it's really old.

81
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:48,490
It's incredible to think that someone
back then could do something that would

82
00:04:48,491 --> 00:04:52,900
perplex us today with modern
machinery and that somehow or another,

83
00:04:52,901 --> 00:04:53,800
they figured this out.

84
00:04:53,801 --> 00:04:58,801
It's almost like what they had done
was leave behind something that was so

85
00:04:59,051 --> 00:05:00,490
stripped tenders,

86
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:05,760
so monstrously impressive that it would
transcend time and that you would have

87
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:12,040
to look at it even thousands and thousands
of years later and say, hey, like this,

88
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:16,240
this defies conventional explanation.
This is not as simple.

89
00:05:16,241 --> 00:05:19,510
And I've seen some of the conventional
explanations of the construction,

90
00:05:19,511 --> 00:05:20,081
the pyramid,

91
00:05:20,081 --> 00:05:24,220
and they conveniently neglect
those chambers above the
king's chamber. They do.

92
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,150
They conveniently neglect a lot
of those massive stones. Yeah.

93
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:31,150
And it's because it's, it's one of
those things you just go, oh, I dunno,

94
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,510
what does this Jamie, they're the,
they're the chamber above the,

95
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:37,520
above the above the king's chambers.
And each one of those floors is,

96
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:42,810
consists of a row of 70 ton granite
blocks that had been raised 350 feet above

97
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:47,500
the ground. And not only that, but
brought from us one in the south of Egypt,

98
00:05:47,501 --> 00:05:50,050
500 kilometers south of the
south of the Great Pyramid.

99
00:05:50,051 --> 00:05:54,610
So if there's any time in history where
you could go in a time machine and go

100
00:05:54,611 --> 00:05:56,590
back and observe,
would that be the time?

101
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,630
I am just completely fascinated
by the ice age at the moment.

102
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:07,270
Have you had one shot to go back and
see what it was like in some place where

103
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,440
you wouldn't go to the construction?
The Great Pyramids,

104
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:14,150
I think right now where I'd go is
12,800 years ago in the beginning of the

105
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:15,710
younger dryas just to see,

106
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,560
because I think that's where
the whole human story changes.

107
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:23,000
I think that's where we change tracks
from one path to another path and

108
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:28,001
following those cataclysmic events of
the younger dryas between twelve thousand

109
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,990
eight hundred and eleven thousand six
hundred years ago, following those,

110
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,950
the signs of civilization that we see
emerging are not the beginnings of

111
00:06:33,951 --> 00:06:35,120
civilization there.

112
00:06:35,121 --> 00:06:39,740
A restarting of civilization that
had existed before the cataclysm.

113
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:42,440
And for that reason, um, I would, uh,

114
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:46,340
I would like to be present
during that cataclysmic event,

115
00:06:46,341 --> 00:06:49,890
if only to satisfy myself that it was
indeed a comet. You see, the, the,

116
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,331
the one thing,

117
00:06:50,331 --> 00:06:55,331
there's no dispute about any more is that
the younger dryas was a cataclysm that

118
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:59,530
you can't, they can't argue
about that. The, the, the,
the megafauna that, uh, that,

119
00:06:59,531 --> 00:07:02,870
that die off, the disruption of human
activity that takes place at that time,

120
00:07:02,871 --> 00:07:04,100
the huge climate changes.

121
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:08,270
This was a cataclysm by any standards
where the argument still goes on is what

122
00:07:08,271 --> 00:07:12,860
caused that, what caused the
cataclysm. I vote strongly for comet,

123
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:16,640
multiple fragments of a comet hitting
the North American ice cap and hitting

124
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,560
Greenland as well.

125
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,070
But there are other researchers in the
field like my colleague Robert Schoch who

126
00:07:22,071 --> 00:07:25,580
thinks that the sudden is more
involved. This is healthy. This is very,

127
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,020
very healthy that they should,

128
00:07:27,021 --> 00:07:30,380
we should be approaching this problem
from many different perspectives and

129
00:07:30,381 --> 00:07:35,381
trying to figure out what the fuck cause
this extraordinary event that occurs at

130
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:39,160
a pivotal moment in the human story,
the end of the Stone Age,

131
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,750
the beginning of the Misa
Lithic the end of the ice age,

132
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,490
the beginning of the
current age of the earth.

133
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:47,480
And suddenly we see these
signs of civilization
appearing and in places like go

134
00:07:47,481 --> 00:07:48,081
back to the tippy.

135
00:07:48,081 --> 00:07:53,081
Those signs already include
highly sophisticated knowledge
and that's why I feel

136
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,500
we really need to investigate the Amazon.
There are,

137
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:00,770
there are three places in the world
which are really lacking in the

138
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,000
investigation right now.

139
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:06,260
One of them is the Amazon five and
a half million square kilometers,

140
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:10,790
very little archaeology done. Another
is the Sahara desert, the Sahara desert,

141
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:14,480
tough place to work. I can understand why
there's little archaeology done there,

142
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,750
but the Sahara desert was green during
the ice age has had a completely

143
00:08:17,751 --> 00:08:18,830
different climate regime.

144
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,620
We should consider the possibility that
missing parts of the human story are

145
00:08:21,621 --> 00:08:25,400
there. And then under the continental
shelves, because sea level rose 400 feet,

146
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:30,580
these are three domains that archeology
has largely not investigated and,

147
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,080
and it is largely not done.
So they say,

148
00:08:33,081 --> 00:08:35,660
well why would we spend the
money on marine archeology?

149
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:39,050
It's much better to spend it on looking
for shipwrecks rather than looking for

150
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:41,540
signs of a lost civilization
because we archeologists, no,

151
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:45,800
there was no loss of realization.
So that's the argument
for the resources there.

152
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:48,770
And, and the same, the same with
the Amazon. And the same with the,

153
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:53,450
with with the Sahara desert places in
the very places in the world that those

154
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:57,780
amongst us who are charged
with the responsibility of
interpreting the past have

155
00:08:57,781 --> 00:09:01,800
not looked at are the very
prices we should be looking at.
