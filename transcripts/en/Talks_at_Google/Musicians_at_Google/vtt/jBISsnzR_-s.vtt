[APPLAUSE]

00:00:06.318 --> 00:00:09.234
KATE VOEGELE: Thanks, you guys.

00:00:09.234 --> 00:00:10.692
It's so fun to be here.

00:00:10.692 --> 00:00:14.140
I was saying, this is way more
legit than a lot of the music

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.280
venues that I play.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.980
You guys have
matcha lattes here.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.156
They don't have that at
all the music venues.

00:00:20.156 --> 00:00:21.460
This is really cool, actually.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.740
I'm from Cleveland,
so not far away.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:24.437
AUDIENCE: Ohio!

00:00:24.437 --> 00:00:25.520
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah, right?

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.300
I know it's kind of a
controversial thing.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.910
I'm playing tonight in the
city, and I'm kind of like--

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.450
I was telling
Jason, I always try

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.450
to tell a joke, kind of,
about the thing where

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:38.450
I'm from Buckeye Nation.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.217
It never quite lands, so I'm
not sure how to approach it.

00:00:43.217 --> 00:00:44.050
But no it's awesome.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.990
It's so great to be here.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.760
I love the Midwest and
stuff, so thank you

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.380
guys for staying on a Friday
when the weather is psycho

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.350
and hanging out.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.560
I want to play you guys my new
single, which I put out just

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.520
about a month ago.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.430
And this is kind of a song
about taking your power back

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.971
when somebody has messed
with you or whatever,

00:01:02.971 --> 00:01:04.470
manipulated you and
stuff like that.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.089
So I'd written a lot of
sad, bummed out songs

00:01:09.089 --> 00:01:10.630
about things like
this, but I figured

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.125
that it was kind of time to
do something a little bit

00:01:13.125 --> 00:01:14.500
different, from
a little bit more

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.070
of a angle that
takes back the power.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.620
This is a very acoustic version.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.270
The actual track is
a lot more produced.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.730
It's called "Shoot This Arrow."

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.730
[MUSIC - KATE VOEGELE, "SHOOT
 THIS ARROW"]

00:05:21.595 --> 00:05:24.565
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.390
JASON ANDREAS: Well
thank you, Kate,

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.400
thank you so much for
playing that song for us.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.527
We'll talk about
the song and some

00:05:34.527 --> 00:05:37.110
of its meaning in a little bit,
but thank you for stopping in.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.250
I know you said on
the intro to the song,

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.210
it is a snowy, wintry
day here in Ann Arbor,

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.450
so thank you for
braving your tour bus.

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.690
You guys were in Pittsburgh last
night, on to Chicago tomorrow.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.750
So thank you, truly, for
stopping in to Ann Arbor

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:52.590
and playing for us.

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.879
And you play at the
Blind Pig tonight.

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:56.670
You've been on tour
now for a little while.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.424
You took a little
hiatus over the holidays

00:05:58.424 --> 00:06:00.090
when you released the
single, and you've

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.002
been out on the
road in January now,

00:06:02.002 --> 00:06:03.960
and you were basically
touring all of last year

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.625
and a bit of 2016
around your new album.

00:06:06.625 --> 00:06:08.250
Let's start there
since you're touring.

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:09.249
You're here on the tour.

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:12.864
Can you tell us a little bit
about the tour, how it's going,

00:06:12.864 --> 00:06:14.280
kind of what the
focus of the tour

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.720
and kind of the inspiration
that's been around it?

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.011
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:06:17.011 --> 00:06:17.710
It's been great.

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:22.800
It's been really fun to be on
the road playing some new music

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.620
and playing some
of these cities.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.060
I've been to probably just
about every major city in the US

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.220
on tour since I've been--

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:36.960
touring is a main part of
my job for a decade or so,

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.620
which is crazy to say out loud.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.510
But it's been really fun.

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:43.830
We had such a great
couple of years,

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:48.030
because I had never
really realized

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:51.510
how far reaching my music was.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:53.730
And so I was in
Australia last month,

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:56.730
I was in Europe in
spring and the UK,

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.730
and playing all over
the US, and now kind

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:02.800
of looking to book something
in Asia for next year.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.150
So it's been really exciting
and really fun to bring

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:07.890
the songs to the fans.

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:11.040
The vibe of this tour
has been exactly sort

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.690
of what you guys just saw.

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:18.330
It's been super just an
intimate, acoustic experience

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.070
where I can feel
like I'm just having

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:22.287
some hang time with my
fans, which is really

00:07:22.287 --> 00:07:23.370
important to me, you know?

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:24.240
I'm a Midwest girl.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.350
I'm from Ohio.

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:27.150
It's kind of in my
personality, and I

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:30.240
wanted to take that and
bring that to this tour

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.790
more than I have
with other tours.

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:33.350
And so it's been really cool

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:33.780
JASON ANDREAS: That's awesome.

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.800
And you're playing with
Tyler Hilton, too, so--

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:36.120
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.161
JASON ANDREAS: --for those
of you guys that know,

00:07:38.161 --> 00:07:40.800
Tyler was also a
"One Tree Hill" alum.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:41.790
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah.

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:42.750
JASON ANDREAS: So
you guys, obviously,

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:43.880
have a really strong dynamic.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:44.740
You have a good history.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:46.323
How do you guys work
so well together?

00:07:46.323 --> 00:07:48.300
And you were-- you've
done the Australian tour

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.470
and the European tour with him.

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:49.920
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.180
JASON ANDREAS: You guys
have a pretty cool kind

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:53.720
of stage presence together,
and you play a lot on stage

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:54.220
together.

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.200
Tell us about kind of
why you and Tyler vibe

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:56.970
so well together.

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:58.178
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah, for sure.

00:07:58.178 --> 00:08:01.470
We started with a
UK tour in 2015,

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:03.150
and it's cool,
because both of us

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:05.430
played our music on the
show "One Tree Hill,"

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:07.560
but we never worked
together on the same season

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.050
or the same episode let alone.

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:11.940
And so we thought
this might be kind

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:15.060
of fun for fans who know
both of us from the show

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:17.130
but never saw us
interact on the show.

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:19.110
And so it's almost like--

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:21.210
it feels like a bonus
feature or something

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:23.520
on like a DVD collection.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.800
Even though, obviously,
we're ourselves and not

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.960
our characters,
it's a cool thing,

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.730
and it's exciting
for fans to see.

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:32.070
And then halfway
through that first tour,

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:35.549
we started inviting each other
up during our respective sets

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:36.760
to sing harmonies and play.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.115
And we were like, we should
just do this together, and be

00:08:40.115 --> 00:08:41.490
on stage together
the whole time,

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:44.250
and make it kind of
a songwriters round.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:46.830
If anybody's been to Nashville
or maybe watched the show

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:49.740
"Nashville," that's a big
thing in the songwriting world,

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.780
is kind of hanging a round
where you and I would

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:54.090
be up here with guitars and we'd
switch on and off playing songs

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:54.260
and--

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:55.350
JASON ANDREAS: That
probably wouldn't go so well

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:56.884
if it was you and I, though.

00:08:56.884 --> 00:08:58.050
I don't know what I'm doing.

00:08:58.050 --> 00:08:58.440
KATE VOEGELE: You could try.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.315
You never know.

00:08:59.315 --> 00:09:00.210
JASON ANDREAS: I'll
karaoke with you.

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:01.918
KATE VOEGELE: You have
guitars, you know.

00:09:01.918 --> 00:09:03.540
You've got the equipment.

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.480
But it's cool, and the
dynamic is really unique.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.100
We play off of each
other really well.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.290
Tyler and I have had
extremely parallel careers.

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:13.650
It's really funny,
kind of like we're just

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:17.730
guy-girl versions of each other
in some ways with our music.

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:22.500
And so it's really been a
super congruent way to kind

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.780
of bring this new angle
to our music, to our fans,

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:26.280
and it's been fun
to do it together.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.540
JASON ANDREAS: That's awesome.

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:28.470
I'm going to hit
the show tonight,

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:29.820
so I'm very psyched about that.

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:30.990
We talked about this
a little bit earlier,

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:32.948
too, so I don't know if
a lot of you guys know.

00:09:32.948 --> 00:09:35.190
Another "One Tree Hill"
alum, Jana Kramer,

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:38.250
is from Rochester Hill, so
she's just right up the road.

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:39.870
She took a similar
path to you guys

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:42.420
as well, in terms of
acting into music,

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.300
and she's found some
great success, too.

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.034
So would you guys ever consider
bringing Jana with you guys?

00:09:47.034 --> 00:09:47.950
KATE VOEGELE: Totally.

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:50.340
JASON ANDREAS: So Jana,
Tyler, Kate on the same tour.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.250
Can we do that?

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:51.810
KATE VOEGELE: Oh,
I would love that.

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:53.280
Yeah, we would
totally love that.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.890
No, she's great, and
she's been killing it.

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:59.650
It's really cool to see, because
I did work with her a lot

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:00.150
on the show.

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:01.608
We filmed a lot of
scenes together.

00:10:01.608 --> 00:10:03.930
And so it's been really
fun to kind of see

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:07.950
how everybody's career and
life has sort of progressed

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:08.910
since then.

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:11.239
But, yeah, I'm totally,
like, I'm always

00:10:11.239 --> 00:10:13.530
excited to collaborate with
other musicians, especially

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:14.405
when they're friends.

00:10:14.405 --> 00:10:15.760
So, yeah that would be awesome.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.310
JASON ANDREAS: Did she do
"Dancing with the Stars."?

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:17.900
KATE VOEGELE: I think she did.

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:18.780
She was really good.

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:18.906
JASON ANDREAS: Can
we get you on that?

00:10:18.906 --> 00:10:19.440
Would you do that?

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.690
Would you-- are you a
dancer or just a singer?

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:21.780
KATE VOEGELE: I was a
dancer in high school.

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:21.960
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah?

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:22.751
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah.

00:10:22.751 --> 00:10:24.120
You know, I've thought about it.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.751
I would have to really,
seriously consider it, just

00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:29.250
because I would be so afraid
that I would wipe out and break

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:30.270
my leg in front of people.

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:31.811
Because that's so
much something that

00:10:31.811 --> 00:10:33.795
would happen to me on
national television.

00:10:33.795 --> 00:10:35.670
JASON ANDREAS: And that
stuff's intense, too.

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:35.920
Like the--

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:36.910
KATE VOEGELE: Oh,
it's, like, so intense.

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:37.890
JASON ANDREAS: --the stuff that
they go through on that show

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:38.855
is incredible.

00:10:38.855 --> 00:10:39.050
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah.

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:39.300
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.716
KATE VOEGELE: It's
really intense.

00:10:40.716 --> 00:10:41.940
I probably would do it.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:44.280
I would just have to really--

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.060
I would be so--

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:46.950
I would be super intense
about practicing.

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:49.300
It would like-- oh my god,
I would be so terrified.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:49.800
Yeah.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.934
I don't know, but I was
really-- she killed it.

00:10:51.934 --> 00:10:52.850
I was super impressed.

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:53.155
JASON ANDREAS: She did well.

00:10:53.155 --> 00:10:53.460
Yeah.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:53.940
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah.

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:54.150
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:54.900
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah, I
was cheering for her.

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:55.530
JASON ANDREAS: Well
that's our plug.

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:57.540
Let's get Kate on
"Dancing with the Stars."

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.040
Let's see if we can
make that happen.

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.950
So the tour that we
were just talking about,

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:04.140
you're just doing like a
two-week stint right now,

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.660
and you only have a few more
dates here before you're done,

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:07.780
end of January.

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:10.160
That gives you basically
the rest of 2018.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:10.990
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah.

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:12.615
JASON ANDREAS: What
are you looking at?

00:11:12.615 --> 00:11:16.080
Like what's-- you released
"Shoot This Arrow"

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.800
plus another song during
the summertime of last year,

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.720
so that's two songs since
your "Canyonlands" album.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:25.080
New album, any
additional acting?

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.330
What's on the horizon for you?

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:27.746
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah,
I'm definitely

00:11:27.746 --> 00:11:29.710
excited to do some
more touring this year.

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:32.820
I'm hoping to go back to Europe
and the UK in the summer.

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:36.060
And then definitely going
to try to do more stateside

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.530
stuff when it's warm.

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.600
Like, for the last
few years we've

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.960
been doing these tours
around the holidays

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:46.140
and then after the
holidays in New York

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.940
and Boston and the Midwest.

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.590
And I love this
part of the country.

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:51.870
It's where I'm from,
it's great, it's amazing.

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:55.540
But I'm like, perhaps we should
take a look at September.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:58.392
So we're definitely hoping to
do some more shows when it's not

00:11:58.392 --> 00:12:00.600
the bomb cycle or whatever
they're calling this storm

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.730
thing outside.

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:06.810
In addition to the touring,
I have a bunch of new music

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:07.720
that is--

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:08.678
JASON ANDREAS: Awesome.

00:12:08.678 --> 00:12:10.890
KATE VOEGELE: --on the
horizon to come out

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:12.240
alongside "Shoot This Arrow."

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.980
And I'm not quite
sure what it's going

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.590
to be yet, if it's going
to be an EP or an LP

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:18.627
or singles or a vinyl.

00:12:18.627 --> 00:12:20.460
I have kind of a lot
of things in the works,

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:23.700
but I've been working with
the same producer on all

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:25.904
of this music, and I'm
really excited about it.

00:12:25.904 --> 00:12:27.570
So that's going to
be a big focus for me

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:29.750
this year, is putting
new music out,

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:32.070
and then really
focusing on creating

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:34.750
a lot of cool
multimedia around it.

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:39.690
I'm really leaning in more
to the artistic side of what

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:40.510
I do creatively.

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:44.190
I was an art school kid
before I signed a record deal

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:46.140
and ended up dropping
out to go on the road,

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:48.720
and started working on
the TV show about a year

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:49.457
later and stuff.

00:12:49.457 --> 00:12:51.540
So I really want to bring
that back in and kind of

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:55.944
take an unconventional
approach to my next project.

00:12:55.944 --> 00:12:57.360
And I'm really
excited about that,

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.810
because it seems like there's
so many interesting ways

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:03.217
that you can share music
with your fans now.

00:13:03.217 --> 00:13:04.050
JASON ANDREAS: Sure.

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:05.280
KATE VOEGELE:
People experience it

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.650
so differently than they
did when I first got signed.

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:09.952
So I'm really excited to
explore what that looks like.

00:13:09.952 --> 00:13:11.910
JASON ANDREAS: You
mentioned a minute ago, too,

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:13.950
potentially putting
something out on vinyl.

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:15.750
None of your music is on
vinyl right now, is there?

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:16.320
KATE VOEGELE: Not yet.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.850
JASON ANDREAS: Is there
a reason for that?

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:20.490
Is there a different process of
putting something and pressing

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:21.040
it out on vinyl?

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:21.110
KATE VOEGELE: Well, yeah.

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:22.960
JASON ANDREAS: Is it a longer,
more difficult process?

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:23.565
KATE VOEGELE: It takes forever.

00:13:23.565 --> 00:13:23.940
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah?

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:25.606
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah,
it's really intense,

00:13:25.606 --> 00:13:28.170
and I really wanted to do
it with my last record,

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:31.650
this record called "Canyonlands"
that I put out in 2016,

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:33.900
because it really was
kind of my tribute

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:36.960
to a lot of the influences that
I grew up on, like '70s stuff.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:40.620
And so it really felt like
the right record to do vinyl,

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:43.200
but it was like an eight
month lead time or something.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.200
Because it's-- what's happening
is it's becoming so popular,

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.540
and every band, every
artist wants to do it.

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:51.210
And these vinyl
pressing places are not

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:52.830
equipped to handle
all of this stuff.

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:52.950
JASON ANDREAS: Right.

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:54.950
KATE VOEGELE: And it's
an old school technology.

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:56.432
It takes forever.

00:13:56.432 --> 00:13:57.640
So, I never got around to it.

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.250
But of course now I'm like,
well, if I had done it,

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:00.416
then I would have it by now.

00:14:00.416 --> 00:14:03.060
So, you know, I'm thinking
that I'll definitely

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:05.760
try it with at least one album,
or at least this new project

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:06.320
for sure.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:06.680
JASON ANDREAS: Cool.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:07.200
That's awesome.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:07.690
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah.

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:09.510
JASON ANDREAS: You talked
about some of your inspiration

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:10.230
just a minute ago.

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:10.650
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:12.150
JASON ANDREAS: I
think you mentioned

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:15.480
'70s southern California
kind of folk rock.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.665
Can you talk a
little bit about--

00:14:17.665 --> 00:14:19.290
this is kind of a
combination question.

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:24.090
So one, going all the way back
to how you kind of developed

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:26.270
your passion and desire
to be a musician,

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:28.410
and then what some of
those inspirations looked

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:31.770
like around the development of
who you became as a musician

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:32.460
eventually?

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:33.751
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:14:33.751 --> 00:14:38.110
I was probably the
most inspired to start

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:40.360
writing songs and
making music by my dad,

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:44.050
because he is an awesome guitar
player, a great songwriter,

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:46.570
and I grew up watching
him play coffeehouses

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:48.260
around Ohio and stuff.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:49.972
And I always thought
it was so cool.

00:14:49.972 --> 00:14:51.430
And so he bought
me my first guitar

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:52.837
when I was really little.

00:14:52.837 --> 00:14:55.420
I kind of messed around with it,
I learned a couple of chords.

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:58.180
And then once I
got a little older

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:02.124
and started really kind of
expanding my taste in music,

00:15:02.124 --> 00:15:04.540
and not just kind of listening
to whatever my parents were

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:07.240
listening to, it's like I had
this foundation of my parents

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.480
music that was like Carole
King, James Taylor, Clapton,

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.700
and the Beatles,
Michael Jackson.

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.160
And then I also had--

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:20.440
I was a kid in the '90s, so it
was like NSYNC, Britney Spears,

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:23.860
Christina, like all this
super poppy '90s stuff.

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.900
And then there was like
Nirvana thrown in there

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:26.920
or whatever, you know.

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.336
My mom probably didn't want
me to have that cassette tape,

00:15:29.336 --> 00:15:31.190
but I did and I was
like, this is dope.

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:34.790
And so it was like this mash
up of all of this stuff.

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:37.240
And I think that that's
kind of been reflected

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:41.320
in the different ways that
my songwriting has manifested

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.030
itself on different projects.

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:45.550
That "Canyonlands"
album is super inspired

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:48.490
by some of that '70s stuff, and
the Jackson Browns and Linda

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:49.060
Ronstadts.

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:51.280
And then some of this
new stuff I've been doing

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:53.530
is leaning in a little
bit more to kind

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:55.750
of taking that songwriting
approach and mixing it

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:58.360
with some of the pop
sounds and some of the more

00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.370
kind of modern stuff.

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:01.750
And so it's been really
fun to sort of see

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:06.340
how all those different
influences can sort of show up

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:09.279
in different aspects of your
music and different projects.

00:16:09.279 --> 00:16:11.320
JASON ANDREAS: And you've
done a couple of albums

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.280
over the past 10 years.

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.430
How has your style
changed, right?

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:18.100
So from your first
album to "Canyonlands"

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:20.154
and now what's
coming out, you've

00:16:20.154 --> 00:16:21.820
had a lot of similarities
in your music.

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:24.010
Some of the songs you
can definitely tell

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:26.410
are Kate Voegele
songs, but you also

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:28.879
have come up with a lot of
different things as well.

00:16:28.879 --> 00:16:30.420
Like "Shoot This
Arrow," for example,

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:32.199
has a totally different
sound from a lot

00:16:32.199 --> 00:16:33.490
of the other stuff you've done.

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:35.950
How has your music kind of
matured over the past 10 years?

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:37.533
What's that process
look like for you?

00:16:37.533 --> 00:16:40.030
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah,
it's definitely been

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:42.602
really cool to see how it--

00:16:42.602 --> 00:16:44.810
what things are constant
and then what things change.

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:46.240
And I think one of
the main things that's

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.752
changed from a
writing perspective

00:16:47.752 --> 00:16:49.960
is I'm so much more comfortable
with being vulnerable

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.856
now, and super dead
honest about things.

00:16:52.856 --> 00:16:54.230
Whereas when I
was in high school

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:56.230
and I started writing
some of the songs that

00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:57.940
made it onto my first album--

00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:00.070
I was only like 18
when that came out--

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:02.710
I was writing these songs,
and I'm so proud of them

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:04.932
and I love them, but
I was trying really

00:17:04.932 --> 00:17:06.640
hard to make sure
nobody could figure out

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.020
who I was writing about.

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:10.712
Because I was an introverted
kid and it was high school--

00:17:10.712 --> 00:17:12.170
it was kind of a
small high school.

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:13.990
I didn't want people
to know, oh, she's

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:16.420
writing about that guy that
she went to the dance with,

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:17.890
but then they had that fight.

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:21.920
And I was super closed off,
close to the vest with it.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:25.270
And every album if you kind
of listen to the writing,

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:31.360
you can hear it get more and
more open and vulnerable.

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:33.940
I really discovered what's
so great about great songs,

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:35.840
is when they're just
incredibly vulnerable.

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.298
Like any great
piece of art, right?

00:17:37.298 --> 00:17:39.460
A film or a show or whatever.

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:41.260
When people are just
being inherently human

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.285
and you can relate
to it that's what

00:17:43.285 --> 00:17:44.410
really makes it incredible.

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:49.690
So I've really learned how to
be more kind of straight up

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:53.440
and less afraid to kind of make
a statement that maybe somebody

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.842
is going to take this wrong.

00:17:54.842 --> 00:17:56.050
I've really just gone for it.

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:57.580
And especially with
this new stuff.

00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:00.460
"Shoot This Arrow" pretty
clearly, you know, there's

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.335
some aspects of that
song that are way more

00:18:02.335 --> 00:18:03.460
honest than I've ever been.

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:04.457
So there's that.

00:18:04.457 --> 00:18:05.290
And then the sounds.

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:06.581
You know, I think I've played--

00:18:06.581 --> 00:18:09.610
I've been a little bit
more adventurous sonically,

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:13.040
what types of sounds I
surround the song with.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.857
And that's been really,
really fun, too.

00:18:15.857 --> 00:18:16.690
JASON ANDREAS: Cool.

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:17.950
Again back to
"Shoot This Arrow,"

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:20.050
because I wanted to make
sure we had a little time

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:20.910
to talk about that.

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:22.930
We chatted a little
bit beforehand.

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:24.670
There's a lot of
meaning, there's

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:27.340
some social meaning behind the
song, and it's personal for you

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:29.030
as well.

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:31.090
Feel free to talk about
it how deeply you want,

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:32.734
but I just wanted to
kind of ask if you

00:18:32.734 --> 00:18:35.150
want to share a little bit
about where that song came from

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:37.030
and what the inspiration
was behind it, what

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:39.071
some of the meaning is
behind some of the lyrics,

00:18:39.071 --> 00:18:41.020
and kind of dig into
that a little bit more.

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:42.311
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:18:42.311 --> 00:18:44.710
It's a song that I had wanted
to write for a long time,

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:50.050
and finally kind of found the
right co-writer, producer.

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:53.560
We'd been writing a lot of stuff
together for the past year.

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:54.909
We were working together--

00:18:54.909 --> 00:18:57.200
I think it was Halloween or
something-- and I was like,

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.870
let's do something
with a dark vibe.

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:01.960
And I had this voice note on my
phone called "Shoot This Arrow"

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:04.090
and it was kind of the
chorus of that song.

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:08.320
And really, it was crazy because
the song's inspiration came

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:09.870
from a lot of different places.

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:12.010
But a couple of
weeks after we wrote

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:15.400
this song, a friend of mine
who was a writer on the show

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:18.490
that I worked on took to
Twitter and kind of talked

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:22.180
about some issues that she
had with our show runner,

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:24.580
and it turned into
something that all

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:27.940
of the women from the
cast kind of teamed up

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:31.750
and we all decided
to kind of write

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:36.170
a collective statement about
our collective experience

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:39.977
with sexual harassment and
some pretty tough stuff

00:19:39.977 --> 00:19:41.060
while we were on the show.

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.670
It was kind of an
open secret, something

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:46.730
that we had all kind
of walked on eggshells

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:47.839
and skirted around.

00:19:47.839 --> 00:19:49.880
And no one really ever
thought the day would come

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.410
when we talk publicly about it.

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:57.270
So it was an amazing
coincidence, totally wild,

00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:01.230
that this kind of happened
right after I had just

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:02.130
written the song.

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:04.950
So I felt really compelled
to share a snippet of it,

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:07.500
as I usually do when
I write new music.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:10.576
I'll share snippets all
the time to kind of gauge

00:20:10.576 --> 00:20:11.700
how the fans feel about it.

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:12.850
And it went crazy.

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:14.340
I mean, people
went totally nuts,

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:16.680
and the response
was really touching.

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:21.390
It was really cool to see
that people related to it.

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:25.620
I think I felt like, OK, well
this feels like something

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:28.720
that we should probably put
out sooner rather than later.

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:32.220
And so it ended up coming
out a couple of weeks later.

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:34.720
It was really cool, because I'd
been wanting to kind of kick

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.559
start this next
project and it just

00:20:36.559 --> 00:20:38.850
felt like one of those genuine
things where I was like,

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:40.320
I can't really ignore
this opportunity

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.420
to sort of share something
that's important to me.

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.670
And I don't care if I have
to give this away for free.

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:46.692
I just want people
to be able to--

00:20:46.692 --> 00:20:48.900
I mean, this is kind of my
goal with all of my music,

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:54.180
but I want people to be
able to connect, you know?

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:56.380
So that's been
extremely powerful.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.560
And, you know, the
thing that I think

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:00.720
is the bigger
point of the song--

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:04.700
obviously I had my own
specific experiences

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:06.410
that inspired me to write it.

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:10.400
But to me "Shoot This
Arrow" is not only kind of

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:13.940
referring to speak
your truth and say

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.610
what you need to say even
if you're afraid to say it

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:18.830
or someone's trying to
get you to be quiet.

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:21.885
But it's also about
being yourself and doing

00:21:21.885 --> 00:21:24.260
what you believe in, standing
up for what you believe in,

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:29.995
sharing your art despite people
who maybe try to discourage you

00:21:29.995 --> 00:21:30.620
or silence you.

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:33.830
So it's not just
limited to oh it

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:36.560
has to be this #MeToo movement.

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.370
There are a lot of ways.

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:40.610
I think that that
song-- really for me,

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:44.450
was the moment that
I put that out, I

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:47.720
realized how much of my own
power I had been giving up.

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:51.860
Not just in that circumstance,
but in my career.

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:55.520
It helped me really get out of
the passenger seat of my career

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:59.720
and be like, oh, now I feel
like I can really take control

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.240
and take the power back.

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:04.010
It was pretty cool to have that.

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:05.740
JASON ANDREAS: What's
the reception been?

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:07.490
I know you teased some
of it to your fans,

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:09.590
but now that it's out in full,
what's the reception been

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:10.215
with your fans?

00:22:10.215 --> 00:22:12.440
How about when you play it live?

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:14.150
Has it been positive
around the board?

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:15.410
Like are people
coming up to you--

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:17.180
I know you do a lot of meet
and greets with fans and things

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:17.679
like that.

00:22:17.679 --> 00:22:19.580
Has there been a good
kind of feel for it?

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:21.560
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah,
it's been unbelievable,

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.690
way beyond anything I
could have imagined.

00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:26.030
It's so cool to
see guys, girls--

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:27.710
across the board, I think--

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:30.540
like I said, from a
general standpoint,

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:35.210
being able to really
believe that you're worthy

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:39.490
and take control of your
life and your career

00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:42.800
and understand that
nobody's going to ever care

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:45.140
about what it is you're
doing as much as you are,

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:48.080
and you have to drive the ship.

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:53.270
Seeing the fact that
the song has really

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:54.650
helped people who
were struggling

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:56.930
with a lot of the
things I was struggling

00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:58.830
with is the coolest
thing in the world.

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:00.980
It's literally my
favorite part of my job,

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:04.430
is to meet somebody who's like,
wow I was having a bad day

00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:08.630
and I heard this, and it doesn't
fix it but it makes it better.

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:10.220
It helps people
feel like, oh I'm

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:12.200
not the only one who
is out floating here

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.210
in this weird
circumstance, or having

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:17.270
this horrible internal
struggle or whatever.

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:19.439
Everybody's been there.

00:23:19.439 --> 00:23:20.730
The reception has been amazing.

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:23.910
The fans have been so
supportive and really cool.

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:27.920
And it's really gratifying.

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.500
I'm on this big
group text message

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:33.830
with all of my girlfriends from
the TV show, all the actors,

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:35.610
the girls on the
crew, the writers.

00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:37.430
And it's like the
camaraderie that

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:41.510
has come from us all kind
of stepping forward and just

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:45.770
being honest about something
and sharing our experience

00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:48.620
so that maybe other people
will feel compelled,

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:50.889
like they don't have to
be quiet about something

00:23:50.889 --> 00:23:52.430
and they can stand
up for themselves,

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:54.350
has been extremely cool.

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:56.210
And the fans have been so--

00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:57.920
they've been a
huge part of that.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:58.964
So it's pretty powerful.

00:23:58.964 --> 00:24:01.130
JASON ANDREAS: And music
is such a powerful platform

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:03.110
for sharing things like
that as well, right?

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.650
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:04.490
JASON ANDREAS: You
can write about it,

00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:07.040
you can read about it,
but music kind of puts it

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.260
into a whole different
kind of ecosystem

00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:11.870
where it helps folks kind of
cope in a completely different

00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:14.500
way, or brings people together
in a completely different way.

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:16.820
So I feel like it's just
such a powerful platform

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:18.560
to share a message like that--

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:20.150
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah, I feel
grateful to be able to do that,

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:20.750
for sure.

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:21.210
JASON ANDREAS: That's awesome.

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:21.860
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah.

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:23.180
JASON ANDREAS: You
mentioned a minute ago, too,

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:25.305
as you were talking about
going through the process

00:24:25.305 --> 00:24:27.291
of releasing this song--

00:24:27.291 --> 00:24:29.540
and I follow you on a couple
of different social media

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:30.519
channels.

00:24:30.519 --> 00:24:32.060
I think you do this
really cool thing

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:34.629
and I haven't seen it done by
a lot of artists, where you

00:24:34.629 --> 00:24:36.920
actually, as you're going
through the creative process,

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.360
you share a lot with your fans.

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:38.750
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah.

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:40.220
JASON ANDREAS: You'll
sit down on Facebook Live

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:42.290
or you'll sit down on
Instagram and you'll

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:43.790
play a little bit
of a song you're

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:45.167
thinking about releasing.

00:24:45.167 --> 00:24:47.000
And it's really interesting
to kind of watch

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.291
the comments that come through.

00:24:48.291 --> 00:24:50.900
Can you talk about how
you use technology?

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:53.370
You've really
adjusted, obviously--

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:56.130
you talked about vinyl a minute
ago, going very old school

00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:58.760
and then using the platform of
technology to connect with fans

00:24:58.760 --> 00:24:59.750
and share your music.

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:02.240
You've gone from kind of both
sides in one conversation.

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.084
Talk about the
technology side and how

00:25:04.084 --> 00:25:05.750
you've been able to
utilize that to stay

00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:07.430
connected with your
very strong fan base.

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:09.263
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah,
that's a great question.

00:25:09.263 --> 00:25:12.290
Actually it's really cool,
because what really ignited

00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:15.860
my interest in using technology
to connect to my fans

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:18.290
was my first record deal
was with Myspace records.

00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:22.460
Which is kind of like
making me feel like TBT.

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:22.970
But--

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:24.220
JASON ANDREAS: Do you guys
all know what Myspace is?

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:25.590
KATE VOEGELE: I know, people
are like-- some of these people

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:27.089
are like, I don't
know what that is.

00:25:27.089 --> 00:25:29.180
But you know it was--

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:32.420
I was really young, and it
was the biggest social network

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:34.640
platform out there
at that point.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:37.550
It was kind of the only
social network platform.

00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:41.240
And Tom Anderson who founded
it was a huge music fan,

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.430
and so he decided he
wanted a record label.

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:47.030
And he actually hit
me up through Myspace

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:48.350
and asked me if I was signed--

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:48.520
JASON ANDREAS: The Tom.

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:48.990
KATE VOEGELE: --and
was like, want

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:52.130
to come out to Santa Monica
and showcase for my label?

00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:54.770
And I was like, first of
all, this is a real guy.

00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:56.330
That's crazy.

00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:59.480
And second of all, I love that
he's using his social media

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.280
platform to contact people.

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:04.400
Like, he's the
true early adopter.

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:05.280
It was amazing.

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:08.960
So that record deal was
life changing for me,

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:14.210
because I really learned
just how much reach

00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:19.310
that platform afforded me.

00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:21.590
And so I started
using Myspace, and I

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:26.897
started trying to figure
out, OK, well what

00:26:26.897 --> 00:26:27.980
artists are similar to me?

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:29.180
Who likes Ingrid Michaelson?

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:32.000
OK, well, maybe that they
would want to come to my show.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.980
And things like that and kind
of the connectivity of just how

00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:40.240
quickly you could
reach somebody who

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:43.650
was a potential fan or already
a fan started to really sink in.

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:50.480
So now that we have so many
unbelievable means to interact

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:53.390
with our fan base
as creatives, that's

00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:56.150
what gets me super excited
about the Facebook Lives

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:59.660
and about the
Instagram, and we live

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:01.910
stream our shows sometimes.

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:03.560
The stories, I try
to really share

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:05.720
sort of what it's like
being on the road.

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:08.030
I mean none of this
stuff was anything

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:10.440
I was able to do five
years ago or whatever.

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:14.960
And so it's something
that I think is really--

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:18.710
we're at a really fun,
unprecedented time in music

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:21.120
and the creative entertainment
world in general,

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:24.260
where you have people excited
about vinyl and even cassette

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:25.370
tapes.

00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:27.470
With all these shows
kind of featuring things

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:29.150
about cassette tapes,
"Stranger Things," like people

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:30.260
are all about nostalgia.

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:31.970
Especially like
our fans love it.

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:34.560
We take Polaroids at the end of
our shows and people go crazy.

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:35.720
They love the Polaroids.

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:38.240
But then they're also
on these platforms

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.860
and they're using
Instagram stories,

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:42.860
and they're tuning in live.

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:46.170
And it's the coolest
convergence of things.

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:49.820
And I think if we can
kind of like use those two

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:53.469
kind of the very old school
stuff and sort of like play

00:27:53.469 --> 00:27:54.760
off of what's great about that.

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:57.200
But then also bring it
into this new space,

00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:03.720
where you have this amazing
ability to reach people just

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:04.970
with something in your pocket.

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:07.735
I think that is really,
really exciting.

00:28:07.735 --> 00:28:11.270
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah, it's been
such a kind of crazy past 15

00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:14.300
years, where you had the
music industry completely

00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:16.430
melting down when
Napster came out,

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:19.130
that this was going to
ruin the music world.

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:21.840
Which a lot of people
thought was the case.

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:24.710
And technology kind of
got bunched into that,

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:26.409
because obviously
this was a technology.

00:28:26.409 --> 00:28:27.200
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah.

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.100
JASON ANDREAS: And
it became, all right,

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:30.016
technology's going to
ruin the music industry.

00:28:30.016 --> 00:28:32.150
It's going to take money
away from the musicians

00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:34.681
and artists and all of the
process that goes along

00:28:34.681 --> 00:28:35.180
with that.

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:36.740
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah.

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:37.490
JASON ANDREAS: And
so there was a lot

00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:38.720
of people on one side
of the fence saying

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:39.710
this is the worst thing ever.

00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:40.970
But there was a lot of
people on the other side

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:42.630
of the fence saying, hey,
how can we embrace this?

00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:45.110
How can we actually run with
it and use it as a connector

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:47.767
with out fans, and to
change the way we do music?

00:28:47.767 --> 00:28:49.100
And of course, that cycled back.

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:50.550
Like you said,
now vinyl is huge.

00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:53.386
Now there's all this nostalgia
around like old formats.

00:28:53.386 --> 00:28:55.760
So we've kind of gone through
the roughest patch I think.

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.940
I know there's still challenges
with technology, but--

00:28:57.940 --> 00:28:58.280
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah.

00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:00.071
JASON ANDREAS: --it's
always awesome to see

00:29:00.071 --> 00:29:02.424
a musician, an artist,
who really kind of grasps

00:29:02.424 --> 00:29:04.590
technology and is able to
kind of make it their own.

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:05.380
So that's awesome.

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:06.020
KATE VOEGELE: Thanks.

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:07.686
JASON ANDREAS: Can
you talk a little bit

00:29:07.686 --> 00:29:09.150
about outside, then, of music?

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:11.207
You're a very creative
person, you're

00:29:11.207 --> 00:29:13.040
very artistic as we
were discussing earlier.

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:15.170
Can you talk a little bit
about some of the things

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:16.802
that you like to do outside of--

00:29:16.802 --> 00:29:18.260
when you're home
from touring, when

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:20.662
you get off the tour
in a couple of weeks,

00:29:20.662 --> 00:29:21.620
what you're working on.

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:22.970
What are some of the
other creative outlets

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:24.080
that you like to focus on?

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.371
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:29:25.371 --> 00:29:28.940
I actually just
kind of started--

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:31.790
I sort of soft launched this
lifestyle company called We

00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:34.820
The Dreamers that I've been
working on for a long time.

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:38.430
And it's named after a song
from a few records ago.

00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:42.110
And I noticed people were coming
to shows with shirts and phone

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:44.102
cases where they had
written, We The Dreamers

00:29:44.102 --> 00:29:45.560
and I thought, oh
wow, that's cool.

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:47.726
I should, you know, I should
use that for something.

00:29:47.726 --> 00:29:51.380
And so it's been really fun,
because for me as an art kid

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:53.240
and someone who
loves making stuff--

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:54.290
I love great design.

00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:57.325
I'm like so interested in
anything that has to do with--

00:29:57.325 --> 00:29:59.450
like I'm going crazy looking
at the Google offices.

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:00.956
It's so awesome in here.

00:30:00.956 --> 00:30:03.080
I'm like, oh my god, that
light fixture is amazing.

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:05.720
Like all this stuff that
drives my husband nuts

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:07.100
that I care about.

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:09.320
But, you know, it's--

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:12.680
We The Dreamers has become
this really cool kind of space

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:16.160
for me to on one hand, share
content that I'm interested in.

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:18.080
My outfits, my
clothes, what I wear

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.910
onstage or off
stage, and my travel

00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:21.710
photos, because
I love to travel.

00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:24.590
I travel a lot for work,
and so I do tour diaries.

00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:26.570
But I also love to travel.

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:28.917
My husband and I, we'll
pick up and go to Barcelona

00:30:28.917 --> 00:30:30.500
and buy a ticket and
go the next week.

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:32.458
You know, like, we do a
lot of stuff like that.

00:30:32.458 --> 00:30:35.250
So it's kind of a fun space
for people to get to know me,

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:39.290
but also for me to share cool
photography, and just things

00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:42.050
that I'm into at the moment
whether it's with decor

00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:42.920
or whatever.

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:45.890
And then also it's
got an e-commerce side

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:50.330
where I started designing
these printed leggings,

00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:55.910
kind of a yoga pants type thing,
based on prints that I made,

00:30:55.910 --> 00:30:58.656
patterns that I made out
of my watercolor paintings.

00:30:58.656 --> 00:30:59.780
I've always been a painter.

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:02.906
I've always had a painting
set up on the road.

00:31:02.906 --> 00:31:05.280
When I'm on a tour bus, I take
the back lounge of the bus

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:07.950
and there's canvas everywhere
and paint everywhere.

00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:11.310
And that's kind of
my creative outlet

00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:14.310
when I'm stuck with
writer's block or whatever.

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:16.020
Painting and
designing really helps

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:19.860
me have a new
creative perspective.

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:22.710
And so I wanted to take
that and create something

00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:26.460
that could be more
of a lifestyle thing,

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:28.470
instead of just
paintings themselves.

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:31.380
It's been really fun and really
exciting to start developing

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:33.900
that, and it is
something that I'm really

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:38.190
excited to fold into what
I'm doing with this new music

00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:38.730
this year.

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:41.640
Because I've always
designed my album covers,

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:47.250
my t-shirts, and I've done a
bunch of brush letter lyric

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:48.460
print type things.

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:50.730
So it's a big part of
who I am as a musician,

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:53.400
but it's also just a huge
part of who I am as a person.

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:56.440
So I'm excited to kind
of have that outlet.

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:58.950
And, I think, just give
my fans an opportunity

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:01.650
to interact with sort
of my creative vision

00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:04.230
in a way that's outside
of just buying a CD

00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:05.415
or coming to a show.

00:32:05.415 --> 00:32:06.240
JASON ANDREAS: Sure,
and you mentioned

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.250
you get a lot of your creative
vision from travel, too.

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:08.530
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah.

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:10.560
JASON ANDREAS: What's,
like, in all of the touring

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:12.476
that you've done and the
opportunity to travel

00:32:12.476 --> 00:32:14.640
that you've had with
your career, what's

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:15.944
your favorite spot?

00:32:15.944 --> 00:32:17.610
I hate when people
ask me this question,

00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:20.670
so I just totally bit
the bullet on this one,

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:22.860
because it's hard to pick
just one, I know, right?

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:25.530
So it's 15 things and it
turns into a conversation.

00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:27.330
But do you have
a favorite memory

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:29.640
from being on the road or
touring or anything like that

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:31.410
where you were like this is
just literally the coolest place

00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:32.420
I've ever been?

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:32.695
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah.

00:32:32.695 --> 00:32:34.290
JASON ANDREAS: I don't know If
we'll ever be able to top this.

00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:35.550
What's that for you?

00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:37.590
KATE VOEGELE: There
have been so many.

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:41.829
I think for me, playing
my first show in Paris

00:32:41.829 --> 00:32:44.370
and having it sell out, and that
was my first time ever going

00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:47.460
to Paris, was totally surreal.

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:48.486
It was so wild.

00:32:48.486 --> 00:32:50.110
Because I've always
wanted to go there,

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:53.519
and I had no idea that there
were so many fans there

00:32:53.519 --> 00:32:55.560
and that it would sell
out when I had never been.

00:32:55.560 --> 00:33:00.210
And so that was pretty
epic, and it's pretty cool

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:03.330
that we've continued to go
back and play shows there year

00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:04.020
after year.

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:07.410
And Sydney this past
December was an incredible.

00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:09.220
I mean, all of Australia
was incredible,

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:10.940
but that city was wild.

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:14.580
I've always wanted to
go there and our show

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:18.220
sold out so quickly we had add
another one like right away.

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:21.900
And so I think
when I'm somewhere

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:25.500
kind of that is a
destination that I've always

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:26.970
wanted to go to
anyways, and then I

00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:29.511
realize that, wow, there's
people who know my music here

00:33:29.511 --> 00:33:30.010
you know?

00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:31.320
And not only do
they know my music,

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:33.653
but they want to come to a
show and I've never been here

00:33:33.653 --> 00:33:35.080
before, that is a crazy feeling.

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:37.530
So it's always the first
time going somewhere

00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:42.180
that feels far flung
for a kid from Ohio,

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:44.250
the first time going
there to sell out of show

00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:46.500
is the craziest experience ever.

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:48.690
So I'm so grateful for
that and so grateful

00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:52.062
for the fans, that they
are patient with us,

00:33:52.062 --> 00:33:54.270
because sometimes it takes
forever for us to get over

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:55.440
to Australia.

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:58.380
And so, yeah, it's pretty cool.

00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:00.044
The travel aspect
of it is definitely

00:34:00.044 --> 00:34:01.210
my favorite part of the job.

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:02.910
JASON ANDREAS: That's awesome,
and you mentioned potentially

00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:04.326
doing an Asia tour,
so if you want

00:34:04.326 --> 00:34:06.750
to talk about far flung
from Cleveland, Ohio.

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:08.992
That's a very different
place in the world so,

00:34:08.992 --> 00:34:09.300
it would be very cool.

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:10.429
KATE VOEGELE: Oh,
I'm so excited, yeah.

00:34:10.429 --> 00:34:11.860
I really hope we
can make it happen.

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:12.840
It's definitely-- yeah.

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:15.298
That would be, this would be
the time of year to kind of be

00:34:15.298 --> 00:34:19.260
doing the kind of like
South Asia, Australia thing,

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:20.987
and then we'll come
here in the fall.

00:34:20.987 --> 00:34:23.070
I'm like, we just need to
do some better planning.

00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:24.534
Australia was
amazing in December.

00:34:24.534 --> 00:34:26.409
It was like 80 degrees,
we went to the beach.

00:34:26.409 --> 00:34:27.150
JASON ANDREAS: Perfect.

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:28.360
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah, it
was pretty cool, so.

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:29.020
JASON ANDREAS: That's awesome.

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:30.060
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah.

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:31.230
JASON ANDREAS: I wanted
to open up really quick,

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:33.389
just to see as we get a
little closer to the end.

00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:34.920
Any questions that
you guys wanted

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:37.280
to ask from the
audience, ask Kate?

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:38.085
Yeah, sure.

00:34:38.085 --> 00:34:39.590
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so,
you and I, we're

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:40.889
both from Bay Village, Ohio--

00:34:40.889 --> 00:34:41.790
KATE VOEGELE: No way!

00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:43.389
JASON ANDREAS: A fellow
Bay Village, Ohioan.

00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:43.819
KATE VOEGELE: Wait.

00:34:43.819 --> 00:34:44.319
Stop.

00:34:44.319 --> 00:34:45.409
That's crazy.

00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:47.399
AUDIENCE: We both went
to Bay Public Schools.

00:34:47.399 --> 00:34:48.899
KATE VOEGELE: When
did you graduate?

00:34:48.899 --> 00:34:50.002
AUDIENCE: 2012.

00:34:50.002 --> 00:34:51.210
KATE VOEGELE: Oh my goodness.

00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:52.219
OK, that's so crazy.

00:34:52.219 --> 00:34:54.830
So you might have gone
to school with my sister?

00:34:54.830 --> 00:34:57.000
Or, no, wait, my cousin.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.740
Maybe my cousin
Paige [INAUDIBLE]??

00:34:58.740 --> 00:34:59.864
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I know her.

00:34:59.864 --> 00:35:01.160
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah, OK.

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:03.720
I'm thinking my sister, it's
like no, my sister's too old.

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:04.500
No, OK.

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:05.820
JASON ANDREAS: Do we need
to get Paige's permission

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:07.230
to use her name on this video?

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:09.050
KATE VOEGELE: She'll probably
be super excited about it.

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:10.091
JASON ANDREAS: Hi, Paige.

00:35:10.091 --> 00:35:10.620
How are you?

00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:11.400
Hope you're doing well.

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:12.370
KATE VOEGELE:
That's so cool, man.

00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:12.900
What's your name?

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:13.800
AUDIENCE: My name's Abe.

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:14.730
KATE VOEGELE: OK, Abe.

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:15.521
JASON ANDREAS: Abe.

00:35:15.521 --> 00:35:17.970
AUDIENCE: My question is how
did growing up in Bay Village

00:35:17.970 --> 00:35:18.790
affect your songwriting?

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:19.200
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah.

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:20.520
JASON ANDREAS: Let me repeat the
question real quick, because we

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:21.645
don't have a mic out there.

00:35:21.645 --> 00:35:23.700
So the question from Abe
was how did growing up

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:25.980
in Bay Village, which
I told you earlier, I

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:27.660
grew up not too far from there.

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:30.480
My mom's from Lorain, Ohio,
so very close down the road.

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:33.184
So how did growing up in a
community like Bay Village,

00:35:33.184 --> 00:35:35.100
it's a smaller community
outside of Cleveland,

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:37.320
how did that affect your
career, your songwriting

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.130
and inspiration?

00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:39.580
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah,
that's a great question.

00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:40.830
It's an awesome little town.

00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:45.930
It's like, you know, very,
just, quiet and suburban.

00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:46.710
It's on the lake.

00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:49.830
It was beautiful, like such
a beautiful place to grow up.

00:35:49.830 --> 00:35:52.530
It's really got an amazing
sense of community,

00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:55.410
too, which I think was
probably a big influence

00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:57.910
for me starting out.

00:35:57.910 --> 00:36:00.420
Especially in high
school and stuff

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:03.220
when everything is sort
of weird and everyone's

00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:04.870
trying to figure
out who they are

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:08.020
and everyone's really
self-conscious and stuff.

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:09.840
So writing songs
for me was totally

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:13.840
an outlet to sort of just
figure out all of those things.

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:15.250
I think growing
up in a community

00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:17.620
like Bay helped me to
feel a little bit more

00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:20.980
at ease about playing my
first couple of shows,

00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:23.800
because even though it was
just, like, my mom's friends

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:26.260
and like so some of
cousins and stuff,

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:28.880
knowing that people would
come out and like show up

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:32.020
and, you know, knowing
that probably even if it

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:34.600
was really bad, that people
would feel like, it was great.

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:35.100
You know?

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:38.500
It was really comforting, and I
probably didn't think about it

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:39.520
consciously at the time.

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:42.190
But I think having
a sense of community

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:44.770
is probably the most
important thing in order

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:50.737
to sort of nurture the
desire to be creative.

00:36:50.737 --> 00:36:52.570
And that's the other
thing about Bay Schools

00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:57.040
was art and music
was so emphasized.

00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:58.600
Our programs were great.

00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:01.150
We had incredible
teachers, and I really

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:03.190
credit a lot of
my music teachers,

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:06.640
especially the ones from
when I was really young,

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:10.180
who taught me about harmony
and, you know, solfege,

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:11.140
the do-re-mi stuff.

00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:13.840
Stuff that I still use
in my songwriting today.

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:16.480
And it was so ingrained
in me as a young kid,

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:20.020
and I had a lot to do with how
much the arts were emphasized

00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:20.830
in my hometown.

00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:22.465
So I'm really grateful for that.

00:37:22.465 --> 00:37:23.590
JASON ANDREAS: Do you get--

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:26.090
were you recently in
Cleveland for this tour?

00:37:26.090 --> 00:37:26.830
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah,
we actually just

00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:27.670
played there a couple days ago.

00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:28.180
JASON ANDREAS: That's awesome.

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:28.870
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah, it was cool.

00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:30.440
JASON ANDREAS: Nice to get back
home after time away, right?

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:30.970
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah

00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:31.490
JASON ANDREAS: So cool.

00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:32.650
KATE VOEGELE: It
was so fun, yeah.

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:34.360
JASON ANDREAS: Any other
questions from the audience?

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:34.990
Oh, yeah.

00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:37.570
Let's do two more, and
then we'll wrap from there.

00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:38.752
Go ahead.

00:37:38.752 --> 00:37:40.030
AUDIENCE: I love your style.

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:40.550
KATE VOEGELE: Thank you.

00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:42.040
AUDIENCE: Who makes your boots
and who makes your blazer?

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:43.248
KATE VOEGELE: Oh, nice, yeah.

00:37:43.248 --> 00:37:45.862
So the blazer is from Zara, and
my boots are Jeffrey Campbell.

00:37:45.862 --> 00:37:47.320
JASON ANDREAS: The
question was who

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:48.891
makes your fantastic outfit?

00:37:48.891 --> 00:37:50.140
KATE VOEGELE: Oh, yeah, sorry.

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:51.370
JASON ANDREAS: Looks wonderful.

00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:52.630
KATE VOEGELE: Thank you, thanks.

00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:53.440
JASON ANDREAS: Looks great.

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:54.310
That's a good question.

00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:55.180
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah.

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:56.084
Hey.

00:37:56.084 --> 00:37:57.208
AUDIENCE: I had a question.

00:37:57.208 --> 00:37:58.840
So you've mentioned
a couple times now

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:01.837
that in order to
do what you love--

00:38:01.837 --> 00:38:02.628
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah.

00:38:02.628 --> 00:38:04.128
AUDIENCE: --you got
out of your zone

00:38:04.128 --> 00:38:08.040
in order to make that happen,
especially with the song,

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:10.992
you mentioned you had
to be OK with exposing

00:38:10.992 --> 00:38:12.796
your vulnerabilities,
or you had to be

00:38:12.796 --> 00:38:16.404
OK with signing a record deal,
or just kind of jumping off

00:38:16.404 --> 00:38:18.372
with no [INAUDIBLE] there.

00:38:18.372 --> 00:38:20.340
You just kind of went for it.

00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:23.538
How do you get to
that particular point

00:38:23.538 --> 00:38:25.260
and just decide to jump.

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:27.242
What made you say "Yes,
I'm ready to do that,

00:38:27.242 --> 00:38:28.700
and let's just
see what happens?"

00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:30.700
KATE VOEGELE: Yeah that's
such a great question.

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:32.810
Do you want me to
repeat sort of what--

00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:33.400
JASON ANDREAS: Go ahead, yeah.

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:34.608
KATE VOEGELE: --he asked or--

00:38:34.608 --> 00:38:37.730
So he kind of asked, you know,
how did you get to the point

00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:41.916
where you were OK with
really taking the big step

00:38:41.916 --> 00:38:43.790
where you had to get
out of your comfort zone

00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:46.130
in order to do a lot of the
things that I've mentioned?

00:38:46.130 --> 00:38:47.810
Sign a record deal,
leave college,

00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:51.950
put out music that's really
honest and vulnerable.

00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:54.380
And it's such a good
question, because honestly I

00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:58.430
really am the opposite
of the personality

00:38:58.430 --> 00:39:01.970
that you would expect to be
in the position that I'm in.

00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:03.830
People that I went
to high school with

00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:06.650
are were probably like,
Kate's kind of quiet

00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:08.360
and hangs out in
the art room a lot.

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:10.970
I was not the type
of "look at me!

00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:13.370
I love being in front of
people, in front of the camera!"

00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:14.240
type thing.

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:17.720
So a lot of this job was
out of my comfort zone

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:18.980
from the get go.

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:21.890
I was so awkward in my
first shows and stuff,

00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:25.230
because I was terrified to be
up in front of people and stuff.

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:28.760
And so ever since
then everything

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:34.020
that I've done in this
job has really pushed me.

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:35.760
It was really hard
for me at first,

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:38.990
but I started to
notice that I would--

00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:41.970
to answer your question,
the way that I really

00:39:41.970 --> 00:39:45.150
got up the courage to
take those big leaps

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:49.050
was by taking small ones and
sort of proving to myself

00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:50.880
that OK, I lived through that.

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:51.570
It was fine.

00:39:51.570 --> 00:39:52.920
I played that show.

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:54.090
It was awkward.

00:39:54.090 --> 00:39:55.140
It's a rib cook-off.

00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:55.830
No one's here.

00:39:55.830 --> 00:39:56.460
It's raining.

00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:57.690
I'm 15.

00:39:57.690 --> 00:39:58.290
You know?

00:39:58.290 --> 00:39:59.665
That's a real
thing that happened

00:39:59.665 --> 00:40:02.952
to one of my first shows, was
like this rainy rib cook off

00:40:02.952 --> 00:40:05.410
in Pittsburgh, and no one was
there because it was raining.

00:40:05.410 --> 00:40:07.785
No one wants to cook ribs,
and no one knew who I was yet.

00:40:07.785 --> 00:40:08.580
I was like a kid.

00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:10.380
And my grandma came,
and I was really nice.

00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:13.680
But just getting through that
was me proving to myself, OK.

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:16.240
I got up on stage, there was
no one there, it felt stupid,

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:17.730
but I'm alive and it's cool.

00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:23.370
And I think every time that
I've gone and done something

00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:26.880
that I've been nervous
to do, something awesome

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:30.000
has come out of it eventually,
even if it's not directly.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.180
And so I learned pretty
early on that my personality

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:37.590
is one where I'm going to want
to, like, kind of pull away

00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:40.420
from a lot of things
that are uncomfortable.

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:45.540
But I kind of have learned
that it's really always better

00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:48.870
if I kind of force myself to
do the stuff that's scary.

00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:51.977
There's actually a
book that I love--

00:40:51.977 --> 00:40:53.810
it's cool if I, like,
mention a book, right?

00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:54.000
JASON ANDREAS: Absolutely.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:54.958
KATE VOEGELE: OK, cool.

00:40:54.958 --> 00:40:57.840
It's by Steven Pressfield and
it's called "The War of Art."

00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:00.360
I read it probably
at least once a year,

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:03.870
but if you're ever in a
spot where you're creative

00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:06.870
and you feel like you feel
this resistance toward making

00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:09.360
your art or putting it
out there or whatever,

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:10.500
it's such a good book.

00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:13.410
And it's really just
kind of all talking

00:41:13.410 --> 00:41:14.850
about that same principle.

00:41:14.850 --> 00:41:21.180
It's just kind of like making
art for its own sake and kind

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:23.700
of being able to
get to the place

00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:28.560
where you can feel like the
importance of sharing what it

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:35.330
is you're making is bigger
than the importance of exuding

00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:37.610
whatever it is you want
people to think about you.

00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:39.650
I had to get to a point
where I was like, OK.

00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:43.910
And the same thing holds
true with some of this stuff

00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:45.590
about just being honest.

00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:50.350
Even if it's not the
most comfortable thing

00:41:50.350 --> 00:41:53.950
to talk about, like the stuff
that's happened with my friends

00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:57.342
and I on the show, and kind
of coming out and being honest

00:41:57.342 --> 00:41:59.050
about all the stuff
that we went through.

00:41:59.050 --> 00:42:01.870
It's not comfortable and
sometimes it's not fun,

00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:02.969
and it's kind of scary.

00:42:02.969 --> 00:42:05.260
And I was so nervous to play
that song the first couple

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:06.662
of times I did,
because I'd never

00:42:06.662 --> 00:42:07.870
been honest about this stuff.

00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:10.570
But it's like, you have
to put your own integrity

00:42:10.570 --> 00:42:16.780
above your desire for people
to kind of always like you,

00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:21.359
or above your need to be liked.

00:42:21.359 --> 00:42:22.900
So that's kind of
one of those things

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:24.983
that I really had to learn,
because for sure, when

00:42:24.983 --> 00:42:27.460
you're from the Midwest, it's
very benefit of the doubt.

00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:29.050
Like, you apologize too much.

00:42:29.050 --> 00:42:31.360
Everyone's so nice,
and it's just--

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:34.630
and I've worked with some
incredible people in my career.

00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:36.334
So I feel so lucky that--

00:42:36.334 --> 00:42:37.750
you know, it's few
and far between

00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:41.500
that you feel like you're
in the opposite situation.

00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:44.782
But, yeah, definitely it's
still really hard for me,

00:42:44.782 --> 00:42:46.240
but getting out of
the comfort zone

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:50.600
is always where you find
the coolest opportunities.

00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:51.684
That was a great question.

00:42:51.684 --> 00:42:53.516
JASON ANDREAS: Well
thank you so much, Kate.

00:42:53.516 --> 00:42:54.820
Thank you for coming in today.

00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:57.490
You know, we realize there's
many different things

00:42:57.490 --> 00:42:59.860
you could be doing today
versus coming into Google.

00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:01.290
You've got a busy tour schedule.

00:43:01.290 --> 00:43:02.960
So thank you so
much for coming in.

00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:03.820
Thanks for sharing your energy.

00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:05.080
Thanks for playing
a song with us.

00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:07.540
Good luck at the show tonight,
and the rest of the tour.

00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:09.240
You're always welcome
back at Google anytime.

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:09.860
So thank you so much.

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:10.400
Appreciate it.

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:12.191
KATE VOEGELE: Thank
you guys for having me.

00:43:12.191 --> 00:43:14.790
