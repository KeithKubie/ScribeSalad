00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:02.950
The alternate form of the
derivative of the function

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.600
f, at a number a,
denoted by f prime of a,

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.640
is given by this stuff.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.632
Now this might look a
little strange to you,

00:00:10.632 --> 00:00:12.590
but if you really think
about what it's saying,

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:13.965
it's really just
taking the slope

00:00:13.965 --> 00:00:18.260
of the tangent line
between a comma f of a.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.735
So let's imagine some
arbitrary function like this.

00:00:21.735 --> 00:00:23.360
Let's say that that
is-- well I'll just

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.020
write that's our function f.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.620
And so you could
have the point when

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.680
x is equal to a-- this is our
x-axis-- when x is equal to a,

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.450
this is the point a, f of a.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.570
You notice a, f of a.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.910
And then we could take the slope
between that and some arbitrary

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.910
point, let's call that x.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.286
So this is the point x, f of x.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.290
And notice, the numerator
right here, this

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.860
is just our change in the
value of our function.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.830
Or you could view that as the
change in the vertical axis.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.690
So that would give you this
distance right over here.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.379
That's what we're doing
up here in the numerator.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.410
And then in the
denominator, we're

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.680
finding the change in
our horizontal values,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.131
horizontal coordinates.

00:01:11.131 --> 00:01:12.630
Let me do that in
a different color.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.791
So the change in the horizontal,
that's this right over here.

00:01:19.791 --> 00:01:22.290
And then they're trying to find
the limit as x approaches a.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.730
So as x gets closer and
closer and closer and closer

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.950
to a, what's going to happen
is, is that when x is out here,

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.840
we have this secant line.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.800
We're finding the slope
of this secant line.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.950
But as x gets closer and
closer, the secant lines

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.230
better and better and
better approximate

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.960
the slope of the tangent line.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.290
Where the limit, as x approaches
a, but doesn't quite equal a,

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.920
is going to be--
this is actually

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.780
our definition of
our derivative.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.600
Or I guess the alternate form
of the derivative definition.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.994
And this would be the slope of
the tangent line, if it exists.

00:01:56.994 --> 00:01:58.410
So with that all
that out the way,

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.868
let's try to answer
their question.

00:01:59.868 --> 00:02:02.300
With the Alternative Form
of the Derivative as an aid,

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.300
make sense of the
following limit expression

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.560
by identifying the function
f and the number a.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.090
So right here, they want to find
the slope of the tangent line

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.150
at 5.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.930
Here they wanted to find the
slope of the tangent line at a.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.650
So it's pretty clear
that a is equal to 5.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.340
And that f of a is equal to 125.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.780
Now what about f of x?

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.740
Well here, it's a limit
of f of x minus f of a.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.375
Well here it's the limit as
x to the third minus 125.

00:02:38.375 --> 00:02:39.250
And this makes sense.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.860
If f of x is equal
to x to the third,

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.940
then it makes sense that f of 5
is going to be 5 to the third,

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.924
is going to be 125.

00:02:52.924 --> 00:02:55.340
And we're also taking up here
the limit as x approaches a.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.210
Here we're taking the
limit as x approaches 5.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.200
So this is the derivative
of the function

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.960
f of x is equal
to x to the third.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.380
Let me write that down
in the green color.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.610
x to the third at the
number a is equal to 5.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.465
And so we can imagine this.

00:03:15.465 --> 00:03:18.090
Let's try to actually graph it,
just so that we can imagine it.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.510
Actually, I'll do
it out here, where

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.050
I have a little bit better
contrast with the colors.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.410
So let's say that is my y-axis.

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.250
Let's say that
this is my x-axis.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.470
I'm not going to quite
draw it to scale.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.140
Let's say this right
over here is the 125.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.950
Or y, this is when y equals 125.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.680
This is when x is equal
to 5, so they're clearly

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.870
not at the same scale.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.466
But the function is going
to look something like this.

00:03:48.466 --> 00:03:50.090
We know what x to
the third looks like,

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:57.480
it looks something like this.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.300
So here, our a is equal to 5.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:14.950
This point right
over here is 5, 125.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.680
And then we're taking the
slope between that point

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.260
and an arbitrary x-value.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.650
Or I should say an arbitrary
other point on the curve.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.690
So this right over here
would be the point,

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.130
we could call that
x, x to the third.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.699
We know that f of x is
equal to x to the third.

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:33.740
And let me make it clear.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:40.260
This is a graph of y is
equal to x to the third.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.675
And so this expression, right
over here, all of this, this

00:04:43.675 --> 00:04:45.390
is the slope between
these two points.

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.770
And as we take the
limit as x approaches 5,

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.120
so right now this
is our x, as x gets

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.440
closer and closer
and closer to 5,

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.760
the secant lines are
going to better and better

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:08.120
approximate the slope of the
tangent line at x equals 5.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:16.460
So the slope of a tangent line
would look something like that.
