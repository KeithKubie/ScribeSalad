00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.280
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.440
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: And Welcome,
welcome to the Library of Congress.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.990
Welcome to the African
Middle East division.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.610
I'm Mary-Jane Deeb,
chief of the division

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.890
and I can't tell you how happy I
am to see or hear what promises

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.840
to be a very exciting program.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.630
Today this division is
hosting Dr. Fereydoun Ala.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.200
And it's very special.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.160
And it's different from many of
the other programs we've had.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.730
We always have people who are
great scholars and historians.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.560
Who are specialists
in different fields.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.580
But we rarely have, and
almost never in fact,

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.520
have a great man of science.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.230
And today we have brought

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:24.080
to the Library really a major
figure in medicine and science.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:31.130
But a very modest person or so who
has sent just a little paragraph

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.770
on his bio, and so I had to go
online to find more about him

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.100
to be able to speak more
extensively about him.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.830
But before I go into
the introduction,

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.760
I want to say something
about this division.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.260
We always do, this
program is be webcast.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.370
And so I have to do a little
commercial about our division.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:02:00.550 position:56%
And this is a division which is
responsible for serving, collecting,

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.110
serving the publications
from 78 different countries.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:14.000
In the content of Africa, in the
Middle East, and central Asia.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.670
And it includes three
sections, the Hebraic section,

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.560
which deals with Hebraic
and Judaic worldwide.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.370
The Near East section, which is one
of the most expansionist sections

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:35.430
which goes from Morocco through
the Arab world, Iran, Turkey,

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.010
central Asia, the [inaudible],
and section is also responsible

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.700
for publications that
go as far as China.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.540
And then Africa, which is the
entire subcontinent of Africa.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.200
Our specialists speak the
languages, know the culture,

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.620
often come from those countries,
and we do different things.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.810
Not only do we collect,
serve those collections

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.370 position:56%
to our scholars, but we do exhibits.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.610
We do displays.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.710
We have, we show films.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.310
We have music entertainment.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:20.780 position:56%
We provide different ways to present
those countries, their languages,

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.370
their culture, to the public.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.670
Iran is one of the
most important regions.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.950
Iran and beyond the
Iranian world where Persian,

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.500
the Persian language is spoken.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.570
And it's part of the culture.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:42.710
Is one of the pillars of
the Near East section.

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.320
We have a wonderful
specialist, [inaudible],

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:52.380
who has been responsible for
expanding the collection,

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.780
for making the first totally...

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:04.120
Persian exhibit a couple of years
ago and many of you were there.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.910
It was hundred years
of the Persian book.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.030
And he has brought great scholars.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.490
But Dr. Fereydoun is very special.

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:18.890
And I'm going to read
to you some of the...

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:25.210
achievements that he's, that
his whole career is filled with.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.230
So Dr. Ala started in Iran.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:37.100 position:56%
He went to Dabestane Nezami primary
school, he went to Laraziste school,

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.740
he went to the Community
School in English,

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.250
then he went to Harrow in England.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.170
And the Milton Academy.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.930
And he went to Harvard, where
he took a degree in history.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.440
He seems not to mention
the historian in him

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.250
but we have brought
the historian back.

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.610
He was then admitted to the
Edinburgh University school

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.690
of medicine in Scotland, where
he obtained his medical degree,

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.200
that interned at the
Edinburgh Royal Infirmary

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.420
where he received a
Wellcome Trust research grant

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.470
under Professor Ronald Girdwood

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.970
when he investigated
megaloblastic anaemias associated

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.600 position:56%
with gastrointestinal malabsorption.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.600 position:56%
He passed examination for membership
of the Royal College of Physicians,

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.690
both internal medicine and
Hematology, and he became a fellow

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.050
of the Royal College of
Physicians and a follow

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.700
of the Royal College
of Pathologists.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.860
He returned to Iran soon after
his father, Hossein Ala died.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.940 position:56%
He was appointed assistant professor

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.730
at the Tehran University
School of Medicine.

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.490
And was instrumental in established
the first clinical hematology

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:48.760
department in Iran equipped with
its own modern laboratories.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.180
He also established
a mitosis laboratory

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.750
to diagnose inherited blood
coagulation disorders,

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.730
such as hemophilia and
von Willebrands disease.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.280
Another first was the introduction

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.590
of hepatitis B surface
antigen testing.

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.420
Hepatitis B was a common cause
of chronic liver disease in Iran.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.720
Most particularly among
hemophiliacs.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.800
In 1971, Dr. Ala organized
the seventh congress

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.360
of the World Federation
of Hemophilia in Tehran.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.340
The first such meeting held
outside Europe and the Americas.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:27.760
The proceedings of the meetings
were edited by F. Ala and published

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.710
by Eleviers Excepta
Medica in Amsterdam in '73.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:36.350
In 1972, Dr. Ala proposed the
creation of a centralized,

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:40.280
state-funded national blood service
for the recruitment of healthy,

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.280
voluntary non-immune related donors
and the subsequent collection,

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.620
testing, and processing
and distribution of blood

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.520
and blood products for hospitals
free of charge in accordance

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.130
with modern technical
and ethical standards.

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:57.300
The object was to make these vital
services out of the commercialism

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.470
of the marketplace and bring them

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.060
into the realm of altruism
and science.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.510
The Iranian National Blood
Transfusion Service was established

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.780
in 1974 and remains the
best developed service

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.940
in the eastern Mediterranean region

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.830
and has recently been nominated the
Regional World Health Organization

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.570
Collaborating Center
for Blood Transfusion.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:23.530
Dr. Ala became a member of
the World Health Organization

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:26.340
for the Eastern Mediterranean
and Adversary Committee

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:30.790
on Medical Research in 1979
as well as a member of the

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:34.950
WHO Expert Adversary Panel on Blood
Products and Related Substances.

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:39.070
In 1981, Dr. Ala moved
from Iran to the UK

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:42.610
and was appointed medical director
of the National Blood Service,

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:47.170

at the Birmingham University Medical
Faculty, Consultant Hematologist

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:54.110
at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital.

00:07:54.110 --> 00:08:00.940
And he was appointed two
different organizations.

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.360
His appointment as Councillor
to the International Society

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.630
of Blood Transfusion
was renewed in 1998.

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:08.930
And he was the co-editor

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:12.570
of "Transfusion Today,"
the ISBT Journal.

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:16.010
During this period, he acted
as WHO Short-term Consultant

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:21.470 position:56%
on blood transfusion in Byelorussia,
Cyprus, Djibouti, Egypt, India,

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:24.090
Jordan, Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Pakistan,

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:25.600
Syria, Tajikistan, and so on.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:29.270
In 1999, Dr. Ala returned to Iran

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:33.970 position:56%
to organization the biannual WOH
East Mediterranean Blood Transfusion

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:37.440
Directive meeting in Tehran.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.120
He has spent a significant
part of this year working

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.310 position:56%
on the newfound Iranian
Comprehensive Hemophilia Care Center

00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:48.720
at the Iranian Hemophilia Society
in 2001, dedicated diagnosis

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:52.460
and management of inherited
[inaudible] disease.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:56.460
And has been affiliated
with World Hemophilia.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.150
Anyway, why did we invite him?

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:05.210
He's such a great scientist
and we have a National Library

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:08.390
because he also is a historian.

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:11.110 position:56%
And he's going to say no, but he is.

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:12.610
He has written.

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:16.490
And Dr. Fereydoun Ala is also
the son of the late Hossein Ala,

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:20.790
diplomat, sometime minister of
court, and prime minister of Iran.

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:26.400
He is the grandson of
Mohammad-Ali Ala' oh-Salteneh,

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.100 position:56%
foreign minister and prime minister.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:37.710
His maternal grandfather was
Abolqasem Khan Gharagozlou Naser

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:43.970
ol-Molk, who was regent while
Ahmad Shah Qajar was still a minor.

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:46.820
He has brought to the library
some of the translations

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:53.000
of his grandfather, who was, who
translated Shakespeare and some

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.120
of Shakespeare's plays for
the first time in Persian.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:03.140
And these are precious
translation that we hold.

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.140
Very, very important.

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:11.880
And it is also important that
we bring the history of Iran

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:17.410
to the American public so that
they understand the whole span,

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:20.230
the complexity of Iranian history.

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:22.810
We just had a major
conference on the [inaudible].

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:29.490 position:56%
We brought scholars from all over
the United States to speak about it.

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:35.090 position:56%
And the emphasis of this division is
to bring the culture, the history,

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:38.020
the people, to the forefront.

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:44.770
So that Americans and others
understand that the history

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:46.290
of the country is made up of many,

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:51.260
many stages of many people
and it extremely rich.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:55.670
And we know that Dr. Ala is going
to give us another dimension,

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:57.730
which we have not talked about.

00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:02.860
And it in his talk that we are
very much looking forward to learn

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:07.760
about that period of Persian
history through his own family.

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.870
So I know I've talked a great deal,

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:28.600
but I'm going to stop now
and introduce Dr. Ala.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.530
[ Applause ]

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:34.200
&gt;&gt; Fereydoun Ala: Well first and
foremost, Welcome first of all.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:39.590
I'm overwhelmed by
this large audience.

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:52.460 position:56%
First and foremost, I must thank Dr.
Deeb and Dr. Dinavari very warmly

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:56.670
for the privilege of
giving this talk today,

00:11:56.670 --> 00:12:01.180 position:56%
although I have absolutely no claim
to being a scholar of Qajar history,

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:06.570
as the poster announcing
my talk indulgently claims.

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:11.170
This is a rather personal,
rambling family memoire,

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:16.430
which nevertheless does span
both Qajar and Pahlavi eras,

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:20.680
and which I hope will be
of some interest to you.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.450
My maternal family, of
the Qaragozlou tribe,

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:28.330
originated as a section of the
Qara-qoyunlou (the Black Sheep)

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:33.640
at the mouth of the Syr Darya
River (inaudioble) in Turkestan,

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:38.820 position:56%
and was probably settled in Hamadan,
the ancient Ecbatana of the Medes,

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:43.280
by Amir Teymour Gourkani
(Tamerlane),

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:47.940
sometime towards the
end of the 14th Century.

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:51.950
This was the founder of the
Teymourid Dynasty - great warriors

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:56.580 position:56%
and patrons of the arts, and rulers
of what is today, Iran, Afghanistan,

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:59.010
Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:00.580
It was his descendant Babur,

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:06.130
who established the brilliant 16th
Century Mughal Dynasty in India.

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:10.990
My oldest known maternal ancestor,
Mohammad Hossein Khan Qaragozlou,

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:15.600
governor of Luistan?,
second from the right,

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:21.370
with the white beard) grandfather
of my great, great grandfather,

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:24.550
was something of a king-maker,
helping Fath-Ali Shah

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:28.170
to the Qajar throne
in the 18th Century.

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:31.210
The family of my paternal
grandfather,

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:37.740
Mohammad Ali Khan Ala'o-Saltaneh,

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:39.870
was also of Central
Asian extraction.

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:46.010
It is thought that the family was
descended from Uzun (tall) Hassan

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:51.100
of the Aq-qoyunlou (another
Oghuz Turcoman tribal federation

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:56.010
which ruled in present-day Iraq,
Turkey, Azarbaijan and Armenia -

00:13:56.010 --> 00:14:00.710
the White Sheep, who were the
precursors of the Safavid Dynasty),

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:05.320
a great ally of 15th Century
Venice against the Ottoman Turks,

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.510
who married Despina Khatoun,

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:11.170
daughter of the last
Komnenius Byzantine Emperor.

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:16.030
One's heart goes out to Despina,
sent away to a barbarian prince

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:20.300
from her sophisticated,
luxurious home in Constantinople -

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:24.720
a last-ditch alliance to save
the once-great Byzantium,

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:29.320
as it crumbled before Ottoman
onslaughts, and finally foundered

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:34.880
in 1453, when Mohammad the
Conqueror took the city by storm.

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:38.660
Mohammad Ali Khan's father was
Mirza Ibrahim Khan, from an old

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:41.940
and prominent Azarbaijani
family, who was a graduate

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:45.810
of the Military School In
Tabriz, founded in 1808

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:51.030
by the French General de Gardane,
the envoy of Napoleon Bonaparte,

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:54.700
sent to train Persians in
the arts of modern warfare -

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:59.390
a part of Bonaparte's grand design
going far beyond the confines

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:03.510
of Europe, to exploit British
vulnerabilities in India,

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:06.630
and to foil Russian
ambitions in the region.

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:09.480
Ibrahim Khan was subsequently
appointed Aide-de-Camp

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:13.490
(Adjudan-bashi) to Fath-Ali
Shah's fourth son (one

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:15.820
of his 108 offspring!),

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:19.580
the combative Crown
Prince Abbas Mirza Qajar.

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:23.310 position:56%
Later, as Consul-General in Baghdad,
Ibrahim Khan became a close friend

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:28.730
of the influential political figure
and writer, Majd ol-Molk Sinaki,

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:32.840
one of whose daughters was soon
to marry Ibrahim Khan's only son,

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:36.110
Mohammad Ali Khan, my grandfather.

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:40.180 position:56%
My paternal great grandfather, Mirza
Mohammad Khan Majd ol-Molk Sinaki,

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:43.700
whom I've mentioned, must rank
among the most influential,

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:47.470
reform-minded members of the
social elite during the reign

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:50.100
of Naser ed-Din Shah Qajar,

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:53.980
well before the Constitutional
Revolution of 1906.

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:57.730
His hand-written, satiric
manifesto inveighing

00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:01.460
against the prevailing Court
culture of corruption, patronage

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:04.880
and hand-outs; the cruelty and
self-seeking, backward nature

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:08.990
of society, was the first among
such protests at the time.

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:12.170
It could not appear in
print, for obvious reasons,

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:13.810
and was covertly circulated,

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:18.200
hand-to-hand among the most
influential members of society.

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:23.920 position:56%
This was long before 'shab-namehs'
(literally night letters of protest)

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:27.560
or Malkam Khan's influential
newspaper "Qanun",

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.120
promoting modernity,
constitutional government

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:33.390
and limitation of royal power.

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:41.750
My father Hossein, was
born in Tiflis in 1882,

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:44.710
while his father Mohammad Ali
Khan was Persian Consul-General

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:46.020
in the Caucasus.

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:50.020
His mother, one of five
daughters of Majd ol-Molk Sinaki,

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:54.310
was Homa Khanom, titled
Azemat od-Dowleh,

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:57.870
a sister to the one-time
Grand Vizier Amin od-Dowleh,

00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:00.830
and aunt of two future Prime
Ministers, Vosouq od-Dowleh

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:02.370
and his brother Qavam os-Saltaneh.

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:06.300
And here is a sketch by
my father of his mother.

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:15.110
Late in the summer of 1889, Naser
ed-Din Shah visited Tibilisi

00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:18.410
on his way back from his third
European tour, and was entertained

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:24.560
by Mohammad Ali Khan, whose three
eldest offspring greeted the Shah

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:27.910
in fluent French and English -

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:32.160
an unusual accomplishment among
young Iranians, at the time.

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.560
This proved to be a crucial visit,
as the Shah was so impressed

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:39.590
by the hospitality and
competence of his host,

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:42.800
that he granted him the title
of Prince Ala'os-Saltaneh,

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.670
and soon after appointed
him Minister Plenipotentiary

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:49.160
to the Court of St. James, in
place of Mirza Malkam Khan,

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:53.280
who had held the post for
the previous thirteen years.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:57.220
Although his mother Homa
Khanom, decided to return to Iran

00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:01.120
with her youngest son Jamshid
(who was a bit of a mother's boy),

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:02.600
Hossein and his older brothers,

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:05.330
accompanied their father
to England in 1890.

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:08.610
Hossein was sent to Westminster
School as a day student,

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:13.090
but he also received the
ministrations of parades of tutors.

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:17.830
Hossein was a gifted cartoonist,
who drew often irreverent sketches

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:21.470
of the dignitaries visiting
his father in his spare time.

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:22.780
Indeed, it is unlikely that,

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:31.150 position:56%
apart from Naser ed-Din Shah (here's
a sketch by Naser, a portrait of one

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:35.670
of the courtiers) and his brother
Ezz ed-Dowleh's often excellent

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:37.570
drawings and water-colours,

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:41.810
there were any other contemporary
artists producing drawings

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:46.860
or caricatures of the
social elite at the time.

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:51.200
This is a rather unkind
sketch by my father

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:55.830
of Zahra Khanom Taj os-Saltaneh,
daughter of Naser ed-Din Shah,

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:58.660
showing off her magnificent
embonpoint.

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:04.910 position:56%
Zahra Khanom wrote a very frank
memoire, a vivid, first-hand account

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:08.750
of the Shah's intimate life and
his harem, and the corruption

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:11.600
and dissipation of
the members of Court.

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.900
In spite of being brought up
be wet-nurses and servants

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:18.580
in the stifling gilded
cage of royal privilege,

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:21.420
she became an unexpectedly
liberal-minded,

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:24.860
well informed individual,
familiar with the writings

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:27.870
of Jean-Jacques Rousseau,
Victor Hugo and Cervantes;

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:31.660
with European political
philosophy, the French Revolution,

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:34.310
and the policies of leading
contemporary statesmen,

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:36.060
such as Bismarck.

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:39.690
She was considered to be one of the
most beautiful women of her day,

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:42.590
and was an accomplished
lutenist and piano player,

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:46.260
much sought after by
Court suitors and poets.

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.270
In her memoire, she
is highly critical

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:51.340
of the pleasure-seeking Shahs,
particularly her brother,

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:55.320 position:56%
Mozaffar ed-Din Shah, who do nothing
to improve the lot of their people,

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:58.160
or to foster the progress
of their backward country,

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:01.610
while indulging themselves in
useless and expensive trips

00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:04.840
to Europe with a large entourage,

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:09.070
funded by vast loans
from the Russians.

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:16.480
After leaving Westminster School
in July 1900, Hossein qualified

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:21.400
in London, as a Barrister
at the Inner Temple,

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:26.230
like his eldest brother
Mehdi, and was called

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:28.630
to the Bar in November 1906.

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:32.510
(Here's another sketch by my father
showing the senior judge at the top

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:35.180
in what was called
the full bottomed wig.

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:38.890
And then Mehdi and himself

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:47.290
at the bottom.). Ala'os-Saltaneh
was nominated as Minister

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:50.320
for Foreign Affairs soon after
his return to Iran at the outset

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.010
of the Constitutional Revolution,

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:55.190
and designated Hossein
as his chef de cabinet .

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:59.470
In 1917, Mohammad Ali Khan Ala'
os-Saltaneh became Prime Minister,

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:02.690
but retained the portfolio
of the Foreign Ministry,

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:04.660
which had effectively
been administered

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:09.150
by Hossein (now titled
Mo'in ol-Vezareh)

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:15.580
for almost ten years.As a Foreign
Minister constantly brow-beaten

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:19.990
and bullied by either Russian or
British envoys, each vying for

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:22.850
yet further privileges
and concessions,

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:27.370
Mohammad Ali Khan perfected a most
effective 'stone-walling' expedient

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:30.430
for temporizing and
avoiding confrontation

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:34.120
with representatives
of these super-powers.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.690
When faced with their
impossible demands,

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:41.220
he would simply feign deep
sleep in his ministerial chair.

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:44.960
The diplomat would sit, clearing
his throat from time-to-time,

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.750
in the hope that His
Excellency would wake.

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:51.240
Eventually, exasperated, he
tip-toed out of the room,

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:55.020
and the matter would be deferred
to some indefinite future -

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:58.670
the last refuge of a weak
and impotent government.

00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:03.410
In 1919, Ala attended the
Paris Peace Treaty Conference,

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:05.790
as a member of the
Iranian delegation,

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:08.410
which included Moshaver
ol-Mamalek, the Foreign Minister,

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:10.650
and Zoka' ol-Molk Foroughi.

00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:14.090
After World War I Iran,
which had suffered more

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:18.480
than any other non-belligerent
country, sought redress.

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:22.530
Heartened by Woodrow Wilson's
impossibly utopian ideas,

00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:26.070
asserting the rights of small
nations, Iran even dared

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:28.640
to hope that, now that
the invading Russian

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:33.680
and Ottoman empires had ceased to
exist, the provinces of Azarbaijan,

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:37.660
Georgia and Armenia, which had
been lost to the Russians by force

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:40.360
of arms, might be regained.

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:44.180
The delegation unfortunately
failed to be officially recognized,

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:47.210
despite America's sympathetic
support,

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:49.830
due to Lord Curzon's machinations.

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:52.940
Indeed, what passed for the
Iranian government at the time,

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:57.520 position:56%
ignored their increasingly desperate
telegraphic pleas for instructions

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.810
and funding, leaving
them marooned in Paris

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:04.300
with little sustenance
but macaroons and tea.

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:11.400
In 1920, just before Reza Khan's
coup d'etat of February 1921,

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:14.230
Hossein Ala was appointed
as Minister to Spain -

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:16.500
his first diplomatic post abroad.

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:21.200
There is still a fading studio
photograph of him lounging

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.090
on a couch in oriental costume,

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:25.810
smoking a hookah at
the Alhambra Palace.

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:27.110
Alas, I don't have it here.

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:32.810
The period between 1921 and
1933 represented a high-point

00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:37.880
in Reza Khan, later Reza
Shah's twenty-year reign,

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:43.880
which ended so abruptly in 1941.

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:47.990 position:56%
This was a period of extraordinarily
rapid change, authoritarian reform

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:52.560 position:56%
and modernization, largely supported
by most sectors of society,

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:54.540
but for the clergy of course.

00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:57.390
To the intelligentsia, it
represented a restoration

00:23:57.390 --> 00:24:01.750
of national dignity, and an end
to the humiliation, fragmentation,

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:06.260
chaos and supine passivity of
the Qajar period, when Iran,

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:09.820
although nominally independent,
had become a mere buffer,

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:12.330
between the British
and Russian empires.

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:16.460
Like Mustapha Kamal Ataturk's
regime in Turkey, all the apparatus

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:20.520
of a modern state was laid
down during those few years.

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:24.290
Reza Shah's most controversial
measure was probably the

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:29.130
emancipation and forcible
unveiling of women (kashfe hejab),

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:32.010
which caused as much
dismay and resentment

00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:35.630
as Peter the Great's arbitrary
decree banning beards among the

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:37.650
Russian boyars.

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:40.450
Not everyone was able
to accept this edict.

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:44.280 position:56%
Indeed, traditional women in
families of modest means felt unable

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:46.470
to leave the house in
order to go shopping,

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:49.370
or attend the hammam
(the bath-house),

00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:52.770
and resorted to the most
ingenious strategies in order

00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:55.060
to by-pass the unveiling rule.

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:59.490
Some adopted the hazardous policy
of walking across the flat roofs

00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:02.500
of neighbouring houses at night.

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:05.530
In one family, it was related
that the ladies of the household,

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:10.470 position:56%
climbed into large sacks, which were
transported under cover of darkness

00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:13.590
to the local hammam
in a wheel-barrow,

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:16.710
in order to escape the
attention of the police.

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:19.940
It was not until after
the early 1930s,

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:22.000
that Reza Shah's hitherto benign

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.800
and dynamic dictatorship became
increasingly absolute, repressive

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:30.230
and harsh, alienating
the political elite,

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:33.370
and losing the support
of the public.

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:36.370
One of Reza Shah's very
first programmes was

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:39.670
to establish the authority
of the state throughout Iran,

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:43.790
and to put down rebellious
tribal uprisings.

00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:47.200
Having successfully dealt with
the political danger posed

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:52.170 position:56%
by these tribal confederations, he
proceeded to a less judicious policy

00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:56.650
of forcibly settling the
nomadic pastoral tribes,

00:25:56.650 --> 00:26:01.460
banning the traditional seasonal
transhumance, and endeavouring

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:06.130
to turn nomads into
sedentary agriculturalists.

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:08.730
The ruthless enforcement
of this poorly thought-out,

00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:12.450
coercive policy aimed at
changing an entire way of life,

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:15.520
led to considerable
hardship, loss of livestock

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:18.070 position:56%
and impoverishment among the tribes.

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:20.990
Further to the detriment
of the pastoral way of life

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:24.130
and the influence and social
structure of the tribes,

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:28.290
the great khans and tribal
leaders, gradually became alienated

00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:32.680
from their own peoples; migrated to
the capital, and instead of acting

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:36.930
as advocates of their tribes,
adopted dissolute urban ways,

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:41.340
facilitating Reza Shah's dominion,
just as Louis XIV was able

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:45.330 position:56%
to draw the teeth of his
provincial grandees, by drawing them

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:48.990
into a futile, ceremonial
existence at Versailles.

00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:54.400
In 1921, Mirza Hossein
Khan Ala was appointed

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:58.950
as Minister Plenipotentiary
to Washington DC,

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:03.270 position:56%
where he made every effort to awaken
American interest in Persian history

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:06.820
and culture, as well as the
opportunities it presented

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:10.680
for US investment, following
the Constitutional Revolution,

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:13.660
the abolition of the Qajar
dynasty, and the accession

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:16.190
of Reza Shah Pahlavi to the throne.

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:20.400
To this end he traveled tirelessly
all over the United States,

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.810
delivering lectures
about modern Iran

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:27.330 position:56%
and her ancient historical past, to
universities, business associations,

00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:29.590
political and press clubs.

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:33.730
His cardinal objective however,
was to negotiate with Standard Oil

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:38.270
of New Jersey and Sinclair, for
an alternative oil agreement,

00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:40.440 position:56%
more favourable to Iranian interests

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:44.980
than the dreadful 1901 D'Arcy
agreement with the British and,

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:48.550
despite the profoundly depressed
financial markets throughout Europe

00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:52.190
and the United States,
to obtain a national loan

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:53.730
which would enable
the new government

00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:57.400
to undertake desperately
needed reform and development.

00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:00.240
Another important task was
the recruitment of a financial

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:04.590
and taxation expert with
the help of Morgan Shuster,

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:08.090
a much-admired American
idealist, and friend of Iran,

00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:12.630
who had been Administrator
of Finance a decade before,

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:14.820
Dr. Millspaugh, trained
as an economist,

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:18.850
was formally appointed
to the task in 1922.

00:28:18.850 --> 00:28:24.710
Alas, the tragic murder of Major
Robert Imbrie, the US Vice-Consul

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:29.850
in Tehran, by a fanatical mob
in 1924, put an end to any hopes

00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:34.030
of consummating a deal with
American oil companies.

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:38.160 position:56%
The diplomatic colleagues of Hossein
Ala in Washington, Abdollah Entezam

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:42.030
and Soltan Mahmoud Amerie,
were also bachelors,

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:43.880
and they all lived
together at the Legation,

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:46.150
in the interests of economy.

00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:49.670
They recalled with wry humour
that His Excellency was a stickler

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:51.720
for punctuality and discipline.

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:53.780
If they turned up late for work,

00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:57.110
he would ostentatiously
consult his pocket watch,

00:28:57.110 --> 00:29:00.290
murmuring that it must
be running fast.

00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:02.400
When the junior Attaches
wanted a night

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.440
out with an American girl-friend,

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:07.020
they would leave a
ground-floor window off the latch,

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:08.560
so that they could creep in late,

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:12.030
without attracting the
Minister's opprobrium.

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:18.660
In September 1927, Hossein
Ala married Fatemeh,

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:21.600
daughter of Abolqassem Khan
Qaragozlou Naser ol-Molk,

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:26.990
formerly Prime Minister and later
Regent, between 1910 and 1914,

00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:29.450 position:56%
while Ahmad Mirza was still a minor.

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:32.260
Abolqasem Khan was
among the first Moslems

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:35.380
and certainly the first Iranian
to attend Oxford University

00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:39.240
at Balliol College, where his
youngest son Hossein-Ali followed

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.190
him many years later.

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:45.310
Naser ol-Molk only reluctantly
allowed his only daughter to marry,

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:49.840
for she ran his large household
smoothly and with an iron hand.

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:53.610
After his four-year
tenure as Regent,

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:55.940
while the Crown Prince
was still a minor,

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:59.920
Abolqasem Khan organized the
coronation of Soltan Ahmad Shah

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:05.590
in 1914, left public life for
good, and departed for Europe.

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:07.760
While in London one
evening, and in the course

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:11.510
of a wide-ranging conversation
with a number of close friends,

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:14.590
the discussion touched
upon William Shakespeare.

00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:17.420
One of those present, held
that to translate the works

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:19.880
of this celebrated
poet and playwright

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:24.760 position:56%
into Persian was an impossible task;
that the genius of the two languages

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:26.060
and the underlying cultures

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:28.680
of the two countries were
simply too different.

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:31.910
Abolqasem Khan disagreed,
and to prove his point,

00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:35.210
he began to translate a
few lines from Othello,

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:39.010
a play which he had
chosen entirely at random.

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:45.830 position:56%
This is a painting by Kamal
ol-Molk by the way of Naser ol-Molk.

00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:49.500
Thus, in his retirement, it was an
evening's light-hearted literary

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:53.310
conversation which led him
to translate the entire play,

00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:56.350
followed a few years later, by
his translation of 'The Merchant

00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:59.610
of Venice', which he
copied out in 1917

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:03.140
after several revisions,
in his own fine hand.

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:06.810
The final version was
expertly bound and illustrated

00:31:06.810 --> 00:31:11.750
with little water-colour vignettes,
by his daughter Fatemeh, my mother.

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:16.920
And this is the cover of the 'The
Merchant of Venice' printed in Iran

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:21.830
but includes one of the water
colors that I mentioned.

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:25.390
There is a widespread and
unjust public perception

00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:29.660
that translation is
not a creative process.

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:32.350
These magisterial translations
of Shakespeare,

00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:34.680
clearly demonstrate the opposite.

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:38.500
Quite apart from the considerable
merits of the original plays,

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:44.560
the sheer elegance, freshness
and simplicity of these rendering

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:49.110 position:56%
into Persian, marks them as ageless
"belles-lettres" in their own right.

00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:51.820
While the language employed
over a thousand years ago

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:53.420
by the Persian poets Roudaki

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:57.330
or Ferdowsi has remained
entirely current and accessible

00:31:57.330 --> 00:32:01.190
to present-day readers in Iran,
the English language has evolved

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:05.650
and changed radically in the 450
years since Shakespeare's time,

00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:08.100
and calls for special study.

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:11.670
Words and expressions have either
acquired a different meaning,

00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:15.960
or have fallen into disuse over
the years, and the large number

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:19.680
of classical or biblical
allusions utilized by Shakespeare,

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:22.730
compound the difficulties
of the translator.

00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:25.850
Only an exceptionally
profound mastery of Persian,

00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:27.710
as well as the complex nuances

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:31.830 position:56%
of Shakespeare's language could
have produced the clarity and beauty

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:36.530
of Abolqasem Khan's prose -
qualities not normally associated

00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:38.430
with an active political career.

00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:41.730
Abolqasem Khan Qaragozlou
was born in Sheverin,

00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:44.990
near Hamadan, in July 1856.

00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:48.380
Even as a child, he was passionate
about acquiring knowledge,

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:53.530
and he spent his time as a youth,
learning all that could be learned

00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:57.970
in those days, such as philosophy,
Arabic, mathematics, syntax,

00:32:57.970 --> 00:33:02.380 position:56%
Islamic jurisprudence (Fiqh), and no
doubt a little French and English.

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:05.990
Later, he came to Tehran where he
had the benefit of being taught

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:10.350
by the foremost teachers of the
day - Mirza Jelveh, a philosopher,

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:14.880
and Mirza Seyed Mohammad-Ali
Qa'eni, a prominent mathematician.

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.280
Indeed, he attained
the status of 'ejtehad'

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:20.390
in Islamic jurisprudence
and theology.

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:24.470
His father Ahmad Khan
Sartip, died relatively young,

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:29.570
and it was his grandfather Mahmoud
Khan Naser ol-Molk Farmanfarma

00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:31.340
who brought him up.

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:34.470
Mahmoud Khan noticed his
grandson's aptitude and zeal

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:38.130
for acquiring knowledge, and
having perceived these qualities,

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:42.220
he requested Naser ed-Din Shah
(whom he was to accompany to Europe

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:47.100
on his second journey abroad in
1878), to permit his grandson

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:50.380
to travel with them to Europe
in order to learn English,

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:52.670
so that he could translate
the foreign newspapers

00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:54.620
for the Shah in the future.

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:57.560
This is a painting
actually of Mahmoud Khan

00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:00.550
when he was minister in London.

00:34:00.550 --> 00:34:03.760
Abolqassem was already 22
when he reached London,

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:07.590
and he was therefore much too
old to go to Public School.

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:12.670
Instead, Mirza Malkam Khan Nazem
od-Dowleh, an ardent nationalist,

00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:13.970
and one of the fathers

00:34:13.970 --> 00:34:16.440
of the Iranian Constitutional
Revolution movement,

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:20.690
who longed for a modernized Iran,
and had been the Iranian Minister

00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:24.840
in London since 1873,
was charged with the task

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:28.560
of finding him a tutor, and acting

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:32.170
as the young man's guardian,
while he was in England.

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:35.520
The tutor agreed to provide
tuition, board and lodging

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:38.330
for one Pound Sterling a day.

00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:41.880 position:56%
Mahmoud Khan had arranged that his
grandson should receive 300 Pounds a

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:46.390
year, so that he was not only
65 Pounds short in the year,

00:34:46.390 --> 00:34:50.240
but he could only allow
himself a very frugal life.

00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:54.720
By working sixteen hours a day
for a very austere six months,

00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:58.380
Abolqasem was able to master
English, Greek and Latin,

00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:03.600
in order to gain entry to
Balliol College at Oxford in 1879.

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:06.220
Balliol was then at
the height of its fame,

00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:09.050
with the remarkable
Reverend Jowett as Master,

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:11.210 position:56%
who took an immediate liking to him.

00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:13.910
He was the first specimen
of a Persian (and one

00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:16.490
of the first Moslems) to
be seen at the University,

00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:19.810
and the Master guided
him through his studies.

00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:21.680
Rather than taking
an Honours degree,

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:24.330
which would have confined
him to one subject,

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:28.330
he determined to acquire knowledge
in as varied a number of subjects

00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:30.370
as he could possibly manage.

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:34.160
Thus, not only did he devote
himself to perfecting his English,

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:38.180
but he dedicated himself so
thoroughly to Greek and Latin,

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:41.240
that he could translate
Plato or Thucydides as easily

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:44.590
as he could read Shakespeare,
Virgil or Tacitus,

00:35:44.590 --> 00:35:46.940
many years after he
left the College.

00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:48.610
He had mastered them so fluently

00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:53.360
that he could recite Euripides'
Medea in Persian by simply glancing

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:58.140
at the Greek text, when he retired
from public life forty years later.

00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:01.870
In the past, most particularly in
the East, knowledge was considered

00:36:01.870 --> 00:36:04.590 position:56%
to be comprehensive and indivisible,

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:08.270
as it was in scholastic
times a hundred years before.

00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:11.960
If one pretended to knowledge,
one had to know Arabic, exegesis,

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:15.200
jurisprudence, prosody,
philosophy, mathematics,

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.740
medicine, cosmology and music.

00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:20.810
When asked to explain the
movements of the heavenly bodies,

00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:25.650
one could not very well say that he
had only studied political economy.

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:29.300
Jowett's regard for Abolqassem Khan
was such that he often invited him

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:33.610
to his famed Sunday evening
suppers at the Master's Lodge,

00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:38.790
which were always attended by the
foremost personalities of the time.

00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:41.500
He recalled meeting
Swinburne, Tennyson,

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:44.840
and many of the well-known
statesmen and writers of the day.

00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:47.030
He remembered Oscar Wilde as well,

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:50.980
but those with whom he kept a
lifelong friendship were Sir Cecil

00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:55.640
Spring-Rice, Lord Grey, and most
particularly Lord George Curzon,

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:58.850
the future Foreign Secretary.

00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:04.470
Abolqasem Khan's nickname Abol
Curs'im Can was a wry tribute

00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:07.170
by his fellow undergraduates
to his mental stamina

00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:09.700
and academic achievements,
who said of him:

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:14.570 position:56%
"There's nothing Abol Curs'im can't"
Of course, the most famous limerick

00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:17.390
from Balliol was about
Jowett himself:

00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:19.940
"I am the Reverend Benjamin Jowett.

00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:24.960 position:56%
All that's worth knowing, I know it;
I am the Master of Balliol College.

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:29.120
All that I don't know
is not knowledge."

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:31.840
Although Abolqasem longed
to be given one of the rooms

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:34.620
in his college, where he
could quietly devote himself

00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:39.050
to his studies, his subsequent life
in Iran was anything but quiet.

00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:43.130 position:56%
He was given a number of assignments
after returning to Iran in 1883,

00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:45.340
and following the death
of Mahmoud Khan,

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:48.690
he assumed his grandfather's
title of Naser ol-Molk,

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:52.320
and was nominated chief of the
Qaragozlou tribe - the last to be

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:54.200
so appointed by royal decree.

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:57.770
In 1888, Naser ed-Din
Shah undertook his third

00:37:57.770 --> 00:37:59.130
and last journey to Europe.

00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:03.100
Naser ol-Molk accompanied him
and had the task of interpreting

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:05.170
for the Shah, writing his speeches,

00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:08.940
and organizing his
official engagements.

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:13.320
After Naser ed-Din
Shah was assassinated

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:19.220 position:56%
in the Shah Abdol Azim mosque shrine
at Rey, Abolqasem Khan was sent

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:22.300
as roving ambassador, to all
the various Courts of Europe,

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.120
in order to announce the accession

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:29.360
of Mozaffar ed-Din Shah
to the throne in 1896.

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:35.550
And here is a photograph
of him in St. Petersburg.

00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:38.530
He subsequently accompanied
the new Shah

00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:42.490
on his first official
journey to Europe in 1900.

00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:45.340
When they reached London,
the Cockney barrow-boys made

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:47.680
up a little rhyme to
commemorate the visit

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:51.570
of this exotic potentate:
"Have you seen the Shah?

00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:53.470
Smoking his cigar.

00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:57.370
Two black eyes, Forty wives,
Have you seen the Shah?

00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:02.190
Growing public unrest
and dissatisfaction

00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:05.150
with the Qajar Regime,
forced the reluctant Shah

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:08.750
to grant the country a
Constitution in 1906.

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:13.810
However, old and gravely ill with
renal failure, he died soon after,

00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:17.860
and was succeeded by his
turbulent son Mohammad-Ali Mirza,

00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:21.930
who was bitterly opposed to the
Constitution, but had to temporize

00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:25.640
for a while in order to
assuage public disgust

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:28.050
with government by fiat.

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:31.260
Knowing that Naser ol-Molk
favoured constitutional government

00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:34.800
and enjoyed the support of
the Majles, the Shah insisted

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:37.580
that he accept the
post of Prime Minister.

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:41.120
Not long after his nomination
however, the Shah ordered him

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:45.940
to bombard the upstart Majles,
which was cramping his liberty.

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:50.270
Abolghassem Khan reminded the
Shah that he had taken an oath

00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:52.910
to do nothing against the
interests of the Crown,

00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:55.710
and that he was convinced
such an arbitrary action was

00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:57.950
against the interests of the Shah.

00:39:57.950 --> 00:40:02.290
Instead of taking heed, the Shah
ordered him to obey or go to hell.

00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:04.950
Naser ol-Molk replied that
under the circumstances,

00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:08.790
he would prefer the latter,
and abruptly left the Court.

00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:12.670
The following day, he was summoned
to Court and placed under arrest.

00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:14.880
Indeed, it was intimated
that he might be put

00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:17.540
to death for his defiance.

00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:23.100
His carriage was sent away
with the ominous suggestion

00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:25.610
that he would not be
needing it again.

00:40:25.610 --> 00:40:29.540
His devoted coachman Mehdi Beyg
Sheverini was alarmed and hastened

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:32.660
to the British Legation, in
order to report the situation

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:36.200
to George Churchill,
the Oriental Secretary.

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:39.580
Mr. Churchill was away on a
shooting expedition at the time,

00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:41.860
but Mehdi Beyg was
so acutely anxious

00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:44.750
that he insisted upon
seeing Mrs. Churchill,

00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:49.080
who promised to report the news to
her husband as soon as he returned.

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:50.450
Naser ol-Molk was confined

00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:53.410
at the Golestan Palace
until well after dark.

00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:55.080
He was offered coffee,

00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:58.530
almost certainly poisoned
(the infamous Qajar coffee)

00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:01.740
on several occasions but
was allowed to refuse.

00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:06.370
Soon a threatening message was
brought to him from the Shah.

00:41:06.370 --> 00:41:09.370
He replied that the Shah could
do with him whatever he wished,

00:41:09.370 --> 00:41:13.940
but begged His Majesty to spare
him any personal indignities.

00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:16.740
By nightfall, Churchill arrived
at the Palace still dressed

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:18.350
in his hunting clothes,

00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:21.240
and requested an immediate
audience with the Shah.

00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:24.440
He then informed him that he could
not be he could not be treated

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:26.920
in this arbitrary manner,

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:31.230
someone who had the highest
British decorations, the KCMG.

00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:38.550
And that he shouldn't be
treated in this bad way.

00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:42.990
Eventually, one of the courtiers,
Amir Bahador Jang, came to the room

00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:44.850
where Naser ol-Molk was detained,

00:41:44.850 --> 00:41:48.980
to tell him that His Majesty
had been gracious enough

00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:54.010
to allow him leave to go to Europe.

00:41:54.010 --> 00:41:57.890
He returned to the family home at
Sar Cheshmeh, where he was greeted

00:41:57.890 --> 00:42:00.090
with transports of joy and relief.

00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:04.890
At dawn the next day, he took a
ship for Baku and hence to Europe.

00:42:04.890 --> 00:42:08.460
The Shah did bombard the Majles
after all, which resulted

00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:11.280
in uprisings against him
throughout the country,

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:14.410
forcing him to seek refuge
at the Russian Legation.

00:42:14.410 --> 00:42:18.450
He ignominiously abdicated in
favour of his son Ahmad Mirza,

00:42:18.450 --> 00:42:23.340
the Crown Prince, who
was still a child.

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:27.750 position:56%
Naser ol-Molk's name was put forward
by popular acclaim as Regent.

00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:31.470
However, he was understandably
reluctant to return to Iran

00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:34.580
and resume any kind
of political activity.

00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:38.680
Under pressure from the Majles
Deputies, he did eventually return

00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:43.370
and took up the Regency in 1910,
after much heart searching.

00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:46.520
Immediately after the
coronation of Ahmad Shah in 914,

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:50.110
he definitively left active
political life and departed

00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:52.980
for Europe once more
with his family.

00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:54.820
He only returned to Iran

00:42:54.820 --> 00:43:00.250
for the last time shortly before
his death in December 1927.

00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:03.550
Reza Shah may not have
benefitted from a formal education,

00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:07.000
and the opportunity to broaden
his mind through travel,

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.160
but he was blessed with even
more important attributes:

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:12.660
intelligence and common-sense.

00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:17.580
He was conscious of his dependence
upon many of the most able grandees

00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:21.160
of the Qajar era, and he made
use of them early in his reign.

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:24.080
Abolqasem Khan Naser ol-Molk
was accordingly invited

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:26.860
to lunch every Wednesday
for consultation,

00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:28.580
and on one of these occasions,

00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:31.350
Reza Shah had apparently
asked him what he considered

00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:32.900
to be the most pressing

00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:37.510
and significant reform he should
introduce among the myriad other

00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:39.910
urgent matters he had to attend to.

00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:42.160
In reply Abolqasem Khan had said:

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:45.750
"The creation of an
independent judiciary

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:48.240
to provide security
for the citizenry".

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:52.950
Advice which would be
highly relevant even today.

00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:57.760
Abolqasem Khan married relatively
late in life, and Roqiyeh Khanom,

00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:02.330
my maternal grandmother, was only
12 when she was betrothed to him.

00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:05.190
Years later, while she was
visiting us in Washington,

00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:09.680
where my father was Ambassador, she
used to say that as a young woman,

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:13.740
she traveled to Hamadan for the
summer months, in a 'kedjaveh'.

00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:17.770
This was a diabolical
contraption resembling two small,

00:44:17.770 --> 00:44:22.560
cushioned cubicles,
straddling the back of a mule.

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:25.690
The two ladies who were passengers,
naturally had to be well-matched

00:44:25.690 --> 00:44:29.980
for weight, otherwise the
wretched mule would keel over!

00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:33.220
The ladies travelled in a party
for one 'manzel' each day -

00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:36.900
that is as far as a caravan
could travel in one day.

00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:43.880
The attendants and cooks
rode on ahead to pitch tents,

00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:47.050
prepare the dinner, and even to
create a little lawn in front

00:44:47.050 --> 00:44:51.000
of the main tent, with turf they
rolled up and brought with them.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.470
Yet here she was, thousands
of kilometers away in America,

00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:58.680
having been transported there by
an airplane powered by thousands

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:03.970
of horsepower, rather than by the
single mule of her 'kedjaveh'!

00:45:03.970 --> 00:45:07.970
My time is rapidly coming
to a close, but I cannot end

00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:10.640
without some mention of
my father's crucial role

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:14.510
in the so-called Azarbaijan
Crisis of 1946.

00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:17.730
So, we must travel fast-forward
in time to the early years

00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:21.720
of World War II, when Reza Shah
was forced to abdicate in favour

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:26.740
of the Crown Prince Mohammad
Reza Pahlavi, under pressure

00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:30.080
from the Allies, Britain
and the Soviet Union.

00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:34.360
Iran was occupied by the
Allied Forces in August 1941.

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:36.100
Armaments and Lend Lease aid

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:38.780
to the hard-pressed
Soviets began immediately,

00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:42.520
using Reza Shah's beloved railway
- the so-called Bridge of Victory.

00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:46.310
At this point, the Iranian
government was in total disarray,

00:45:46.310 --> 00:45:50.420 position:56%
impotent economically and
politically, beset by hyperinflation

00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:54.360
and famine, and unable to maintain
order among its rebellious tribes,

00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:56.900
especially the Qashqai.

00:45:56.900 --> 00:46:02.170
Over 300,000 refugees - mostly
Jews from Eastern European stetls,

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:06.430
were hospitably received by Iran
at this time, who were suffering

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:11.110
from the usual afflictions of war -
malnutrition, misery and infection,

00:46:11.110 --> 00:46:16.090
especially louse-borne typhus,
which reached epidemic proportions,

00:46:16.090 --> 00:46:20.820 position:56%
and killed two of my Czechoslovakian
classmates at the Community School.

00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:22.550 position:56%
There was an acute shortage of wheat

00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:24.980
because the Russians
had requisitioned grain.

00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:27.900
Hoarding and black-marketeering
were rife.

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:31.110
I clearly remember being shown
an example of the coarse,

00:46:31.110 --> 00:46:34.770
gray bread on sale in
bakeries, which contained bits

00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:39.420
of tarred sacking, and even
the remains of a cockroach.

00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:42.570
In breach of the 1942
Tripartite Agreement,

00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:47.950
and the Tehran Conference
Declaration of 1943,

which Marshal Stalin had reluctantly
signed, guaranteeing the departure

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.620 position:56%
of Allied Forces after the cessation
of hostilities, and the independence

00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:04.840 position:56%
and territorial integrity of Iran,
the Red Army stayed on in Azarbaijan

00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:09.650
and Kordestan, fostering armed
insurrection by separatists -

00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:12.090
Pishevari's Republic of Azarbaijan,

00:47:12.090 --> 00:47:15.380
and Qazi Mohammad's
Free Kurdish Republic.

00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:18.800
The Soviet NKVD dismantled
the administrative apparatus

00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:22.840
of the Iranian government; Iranian
troops and gendarmes were disarmed;

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:27.110 position:56%
landowners were dispossessed; judges
were arrested, and an Azari militia

00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:30.420
in Russian uniforms
were armed and trained.

00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:33.370
Protests by the Iranian government
were portrayed to the world

00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:35.720
as a minor disagreement
between neighbours,

00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:39.950
and the secessionist movements in
Azarbaijan and Kordestan were said

00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:43.330
to represent the "legitimate
aspirations

00:47:43.330 --> 00:47:46.240
of the down-trodden
peoples of these provinces,

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:49.020 position:56%
for freedom and self-determination".

00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:52.210
Hassan Taqizadeh, Iran's
Ambassador in London, and Ala,

00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:55.490
now appointed by the new Prime
Minister Qavam os-Saltaneh,

00:47:55.490 --> 00:47:59.610
as Ambassador to the United
States, and Iran's representative

00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:03.530
at the new-found United Nations
Organization and Security Council,

00:48:03.530 --> 00:48:05.940
realized that bilateral negotiation

00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:09.970
with the Soviet Union
would not get anywhere,

00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:14.120 position:56%
particularly since Premier Qavam had
already spent three fruitless weeks

00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:16.630
in Moscow, discussing
the issue with Stalin

00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:19.530
and Molotov, the Foreign Minister.

00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:21.650
The dispute had to
be internationalized,

00:48:21.650 --> 00:48:25.220
if there was to be any hope of
success against Marshal Stalin,

00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:29.990
who had already achieved most of
the post-war concessions he wanted

00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:34.570
from the US and Britain, at the
Yalta and Potsdam Conferences.

00:48:34.570 --> 00:48:39.580 position:56%
In March 1946, Prime Minister Qavam
instructed Ala to prosecute the case

00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:43.000
against the Soviet Union at
the UN Security Council..

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:47.460
His task was a difficult one:
First of all, 'Uncle Joe' Stalin,

00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:51.270
as he was fondly known at the end
of the war, did everything he could

00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:55.390 position:56%
to prevent a hearing of Iran's
complaint at the international forum

00:48:55.390 --> 00:48:57.880
of the fledgling Security Council.

00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:01.100
Britain and the US, even
including Trygvie Lie,

00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:03.790
the UN Secretary General,
were not inclined

00:49:03.790 --> 00:49:07.050
to alienate the prestigious
victor of Stalingrad,

00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:10.440
who had broken the back of the
Wehrmacht, and they were agnostic

00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:13.670
about the chances of Iran
achieving any success.

00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:18.010
Secondly, in Iran, Prime Minister
Qavam, was under intense pressure

00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:22.180
from the new Soviet Ambassador
Satchikov, to withdraw the case

00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:26.470
from the Security Council agenda,
and to sign an oil concession

00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:29.430
with the USSR, giving
them exclusive rights

00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:32.720
to exploit oil resources
in northern Iran.

00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:36.140
However, despite the
prevarications of his cousin Qavam,

00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:38.980
who actually contemplated
withdrawing Ala,

00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:41.590
as well as the Security
Council case;

00:49:41.590 --> 00:49:45.600
the intrigues of Qavam's Deputy
and spokesman Mozaffar Firouz,

00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:48.650
and in the face of much bluster
and aggression from Gromyko,

00:49:48.650 --> 00:49:55.910 position:56%
the Soviet delegate, Ala was able to
marshal the support of the US media,

00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:59.790
especially James Reston of the
New York Times, Harry Truman

00:49:59.790 --> 00:50:03.070
and Secretary of State Jimmy
Byrnes, together with envoys

00:50:03.070 --> 00:50:06.510
of smaller nations, who saw
this as a crucial issue,

00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:10.350
involving the rights of weak
countries against a super-power,

00:50:10.350 --> 00:50:12.570
and was finally given
the opportunity

00:50:12.570 --> 00:50:15.150
of stating Iran's complaint
at the horse-shoe table

00:50:15.150 --> 00:50:18.810
of the Security Council at
Hunter College in the Bronx,

00:50:18.810 --> 00:50:23.400
and to passionately argue that the
continued presence of Soviet Forces

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:27.140
in northern Iran, constituted
a breach of their commitment,

00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:30.090
and an immediate threat
to world peace.

00:50:30.090 --> 00:50:35.080 position:56%
In protest, Gromyko and his entire
delegation left the Security Council

00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:40.380
in a huff - a red-letter day for
the assembled world press corps!

00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:43.910
Although Ala was comprehensively
reprimanded for his persistence

00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:47.540
by Prime Minister Qavam, and
accused by the Soviet delegate,

00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:50.020
of exceeding his brief, and failing

00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:54.130
to represent his government's true
instructions, Ala courageously

00:50:54.130 --> 00:50:58.280
and relentlessly persevered in
pursuing the Iranian complaint,

00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:02.130
which by then, had become an
international cause celebre.

00:51:02.130 --> 00:51:08.120
In the end, Soviet forces did leave
northern Iran on May 6th, 1946,

00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:11.290
and without the support
of the Red Army, the Azari

00:51:11.290 --> 00:51:13.880
and Kurdish Republics collapsed.

00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:17.760
The only occasion when the
Soviet Union ever released one

00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:20.640
of the victims in its clutches.

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:24.690
As a consequence, the United
Nations Organization was immensely

00:51:24.690 --> 00:51:27.310
strengthened by the peaceful
resolution of this first,

00:51:27.310 --> 00:51:32.060
highly significant
case, it's first case,

00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:38.700
but this also presaged the start
of a near fifty-year Cold War,

00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:42.790
which persisted until the
USSR foundered in 1991,

00:51:42.790 --> 00:51:45.510
essentially for economic reasons.

00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:53.930
Now I hope Dr. Dinavari you were
able to show us a video clip,

00:51:55.040 --> 00:52:00.040
dating back to March 1946.

00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:02.810
Which had to be shortened,

00:52:02.810 --> 00:52:41.090
I think it's after the Soviet
delegation stormed out.

00:52:41.090 --> 00:52:48.120
[ Speaking in a Foreign Language ]

00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:52.750
&gt;&gt; Mr. President, and honorable
members of the consult,

00:52:53.890 --> 00:52:59.590
I consider it an honor to be
innovated to the counsel table.

00:52:59.590 --> 00:53:02.260
It is I assure you with emotion

00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:07.980
that I take my seat before
the highest tribunal on earth,

00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:11.920
wherein lie the hopes and
aspirations of mankind.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:19.110 position:56%
I wish you success in your arduous
labor for the restoration of harmony

00:53:19.110 --> 00:53:21.540
and security and respect

00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:25.500
for international [inaudible]

00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:32.370

of her ability to strengthen
its hand.

00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:48.080
She confidently expects
on the other hand

00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:51.110
to have her rights
upheld by the consult.

00:53:52.690 --> 00:53:56.590
Our case is down before you.

00:53:56.590 --> 00:54:01.680 position:56%
And we want it to remain there until
a just settlement has been reached

00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:04.960
within the spirit of the charter.

00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:09.530
I realize that the question
of whether to proceed at once

00:54:09.530 --> 00:54:13.380
or the delay is a matter
for the counsel to decide.

00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:18.800 position:56%
For my part, I am prepared according
to my instructions to proceed

00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:21.250
with the presentation
of the disputes

00:54:21.250 --> 00:54:27.260
which unfortunately have divided by
country and its northern neighbor.

00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:32.160
I consider it necessarily to do
so at the earliest opportunity.

00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:38.640
Of course, I am not unaware of the
[inaudible] reporting [inaudible]

00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:44.050
of the reb army from
certain [inaudible] of Iran.

00:54:44.050 --> 00:54:46.950
In history, we heard the
same announcement made

00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:51.740
by the honorable delegate
of the Soviet Union.

00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:54.480
Nor am I unaware of the press news

00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:57.350
of this morning reporting
an official announcement

00:54:57.350 --> 00:55:01.320

government and the Soviet Union.

00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:14.170 position:56%
I do not know whether any conditions
are being attached to the withdrawal

00:55:14.170 --> 00:55:19.060
of these troops and may I say once
for all that I know of no agreement

00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:23.910
or understanding, secret or
otherwise, having been entered

00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:28.490

in the disputes now
referred to this counsel.

00:55:35.790 --> 00:55:37.830
No one would welcome more warmly

00:55:37.830 --> 00:55:41.470
than a just settlement
of our difficult case.

00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:46.610
On the basis of respect for Iran's
complete independence, sovereignty,

00:55:46.610 --> 00:55:49.510
and territorial integrity.

00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:54.270
The prime minister of Iran
has in his instructions to me,

00:55:54.270 --> 00:55:57.490
particularly requested me
to emphasize the [inaudible]

00:55:57.490 --> 00:56:01.370
that the bringing of a
dispute by one member

00:56:01.370 --> 00:56:06.040
of the United Nations before the
security council should not be

at my father there was Oskar Lange,
the representative of Poland,

00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:46.010
who gave him a really hard time and
of course Poland was already one

00:56:46.010 --> 00:56:49.310

of the Soviet Union by then.

And I'm so happy that
he's been able to be here.

00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:19.880
John Leland was a very
distinguished international lawyer

who might have become

00:58:22.730 --> 00:58:26.710
that he was a bit brusque
to his critics.

00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:29.020
And so that never happened.

00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:33.660
But he was a great family
