00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:54.710
was going on that was said for most of
 

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:57.070
was going on that was said for most of
the 20th century to be quaint and

00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:57.080
the 20th century to be quaint and
 

00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:00.520

outmoded and and immature and and so on
 

00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:03.900
outmoded and and immature and and so on
and so forth so yeah you're right

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:03.910
and so forth so yeah you're right
 

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:06.430
