MARY GROVE: So good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.640
Are we having a
great day so far?

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:12.430
Wonderful.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:13.580
Wonderful.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.360
Well, I am so honored to host a
discussion today with a leader

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.440
I very much admire,
someone who really

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.860
is a leader in both the
finance and tech worlds

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.550
and is able to brilliantly
bridge between the two.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.020
As Karishma mentioned, Ruth is
Senior Vice President and Chief

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.530
Financial Officer of Alphabet,
and she joined the company

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.630
in May 2015.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.830
Prior to that, Ruth was
Executive Vice President

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.050
and Chief Financial Officer of
Morgan Stanley, where she also

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.810
held a variety of
leadership roles

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.310
prior to joining the highest
ranks of the company.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.920
Ruth has an amazing,
diverse set of interests.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.280
She is the Vice Chair of
the Stanford University

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.840
Board of Trustees.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.680
She is also on the
Board of Directors

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.090
of the Council for
Foreign Relations.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.120
She holds an undergrad degree
from Stanford University, MBA

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.560
from the Wharton
School, and a master's

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.570
from the London
School of Economics.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.590
So Ruth is someone who really
has been transformative in sort

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.375
of shaping the next
chapter of our company,

00:01:11.375 --> 00:01:12.750
and we are so
honored to have her

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.020
here today to share some
personal insights with us as

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.520
well.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.490
So welcome, Ruth.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.754
RUTH PORAT: Thank you.

00:01:16.754 --> 00:01:18.254
It's great to be
here with everyone.

00:01:18.254 --> 00:01:18.823
Thank you.

00:01:18.823 --> 00:01:22.610
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.690
MARY GROVE: So Ruth, you
joined Alphabet, then Google,

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.110
last May, and it's been quite
a ride the last 10 months.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.870
Can you tell me about
your current focus

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.937
areas and sort of what are your
highest priorities right now?

00:01:33.937 --> 00:01:35.520
RUTH PORAT: Well,
the biggest surprise

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.140
when I joined Google
at the time-- Alphabet

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.817
now-- is how early
stage Google really is.

00:01:40.817 --> 00:01:42.650
And when you think about
all of the products

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.070
we have, just go through
them one after the other,

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.000
it's clear how
early stage we are,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.980
which is extraordinary to say
with a company of our scale.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.826
So you think about how many
people still are not online.

00:01:52.826 --> 00:01:54.950
They're going to go online
with the mobile handset.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.870
You think about how
we're using our phones.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.675
You think about advertising
moving from offline to online,

00:02:00.675 --> 00:02:02.300
and what that means
for YouTube, or you

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.210
think about companies
moving to the cloud.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.050
And the fact that
we're really early

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.389
means that we have a
ton of opportunities.

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:13.980
And the biggest challenge last
year was the 2016 budgeting.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.090
How do you prioritize?

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.190
How do I determine, working
with business leaders,

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.070
where to put funding,
how to allocate capital?

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.660
And it was a tough process,
a really productive process.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.410
But it's also not a
once-and-done process.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.510
So as we completed the
year, we set a number

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.460
of milestones,
business and technical,

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.577
for business leaders as we
think about how to fund.

00:02:34.577 --> 00:02:35.910
And we're still working on that.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.571
And I think it's
really a testament

00:02:37.571 --> 00:02:39.820
to just how many extraordinary
opportunities are still

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:40.640
out there.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.010
MARY GROVE: So much to
accomplish, come in,

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.090
wrap your head around it,
and then go immediately

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.310
into annual planning.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.170
So well done.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.440
So you were a seasoned
executive at Wall Street.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.830
How has the transition
been to Silicon Valley?

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.840
And can you sort of
compare the culture

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.980
of Wall Street to
Silicon Valley?

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.570
RUTH PORAT: It's probably
more similar for me

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.710
than I think many would expect.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:03.859
I grew up out here.

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:06.400
I went to high school just down
the street at Menlo-Atherton.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.150
I went to Stanford.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.774
As you said, I'm on
the Stanford board,

00:03:08.774 --> 00:03:11.800
so I had been out here all
the time for the board.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.520
And every time I came out here,
I left, I got back to New York,

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.040
and said, the optimism
in Silicon Valley

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.420
is extraordinary, and it's
what makes this country great.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.430
And when I came
back out here, that

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.180
was the most
embracing part of it.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.380
But I think the reason
it's not that different

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.361
in certain respects is what
kept me at Morgan Stanley

00:03:32.361 --> 00:03:34.610
much longer than I anticipated--
I used to always tell

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.830
my family, I'm going to be at
Morgan Stanley for five years

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.246
and then I'm moving
back out here.

00:03:38.246 --> 00:03:40.480
And after 28 years, they
thought I couldn't count.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.990
But the reason I
stayed was I was

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.250
solving clients' problems,
working with the greatest

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.750
clients.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.990
Got to work with
Google on the IPO.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.310
But it was a constant
learning experience,

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.590
and there were new things
to address all the time.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.490
New industries were created.

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.820
And it's that learning
element that I

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.430
find so invigorating
about being out here.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.460
MARY GROVE: So 28 years.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.320
That was a huge chapter.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.360
Now it's been 10
months to look at.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.770
What has been your proudest
accomplishment of the last 10

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.439
months since joining Alphabet?

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:11.230
RUTH PORAT: This may
sound like an odd one,

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.560
but I think culture is so
critical to the success

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.100
of any organization.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.870
Culture defines the way people
act in ways that rules can't.

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.240
It's just the
unwritten, the ethics,

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.860
the creed that people follow.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.630
And I feel very
much at home here.

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.040
I feel I've got an
extraordinary team.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.430
And for me, just being able to
get in the slipstream is what

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.720
it feels like, is really
important to being

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.860
able to get things done.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.280
MARY GROVE: So looking
across the Google universe,

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.870
then, what is a product area
or an emerging technology

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.815
that you're especially bullish
on, excited about, and why?

00:04:47.815 --> 00:04:50.190
RUTH PORAT: It's a hard one
to answer, because as I said,

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.850
we're so early stage
across a number of areas.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:57.050
I'm really excited about the way
the personal assistant machine

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.800
learning is affecting how we
use our phone, the ability

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.747
to predict what we need
and be so much more useful.

00:05:03.747 --> 00:05:05.580
I love what's going on
with virtual reality.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.680
I'm really excited about what
we're doing in education.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.240
We are a leading player in
schools with our Chromebooks.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.337
And more than that, we have
this virtual reality product

00:05:17.337 --> 00:05:19.170
called Cardboard, which
hopefully all of you

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:20.380
have experienced.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.130
And we can take
kids back in history

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.980
and around the globe with
something that's super simple.

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.290
You just slot your phone
in, and it's the ability

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.380
to provide anybody--
it's not just

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.550
for the few elite-- anybody can
go anywhere around the globe.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.340
And the ability to tell kids,
you can be anything, you

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.520
can get anywhere.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.790
I find that really exciting.

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:45.710
So it's not a very fair answer,
but it's an accurate answer.

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.600
We have a leader who's
focused on something

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.080
that's a priority for us,
the next billion users.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.400
The ability to bring the next
four to five billion people out

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.890
of poverty by giving them
access to information.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.120
All of these things
to me are what makes

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.539
it so exciting to be here.

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:03.580
MARY GROVE: It's so amazing
and refreshing for me

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.996
to hear you say that Google's
early stage in so many ways,

00:06:05.996 --> 00:06:09.680
because I joined Google
in 2004, so 12 years ago,

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.220
and at the time we were
about 2,000 people.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.210
Now, of course, we're
over 60,000 people.

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.700
But refreshing for
me and so many of us

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.030
to still remember that we
still are so early stage

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.627
in so many areas, and there's so
much opportunity still to come.

00:06:22.627 --> 00:06:23.460
RUTH PORAT: Exactly.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.300
MARY GROVE: So I want
to shift gears a bit

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.025
and talk about leadership,
and your perspective on that,

00:06:28.025 --> 00:06:30.240
and lessons that we
can learn from you.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.450
So what would you say
you look for most?

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.950
What core attributes,
when you build a team

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.320
and you hire leadership
into your team,

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.951
what do you look for?

00:06:38.951 --> 00:06:40.700
RUTH PORAT: I look for
a number of things.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.200
One, clearly passion
and excellence

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.270
in all that's being done.

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:47.900
I look for
intellectual curiosity,

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.360
because the one thing you know
is the world will constantly

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:50.740
change.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.031
I want people who are learners.

00:06:52.031 --> 00:06:54.880
I want people who always
start questions with, well,

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:55.890
what are we solving for?

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:58.570
Because you can solve
any problem if you stop

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:03.880
and actually ask, how do we
think about this differently?

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.300
I do like to have
a mix of people

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.770
for whom a role is
a massive stretch

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:13.880
goal, coupled with those where
they have pattern recognition.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.250
That's a term I use a lot.

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:19.030
I think experience, and
therefore pattern recognition,

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:20.830
is really valuable.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.630
And having the right
mix on your team is key,

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:27.110
and it underscores why the
experience everyone gets

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:29.735
in their first role or
second role is so key.

00:07:29.735 --> 00:07:31.720
You get a lot of
great experiences

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.940
that then are relevant
in later life.

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:37.550
I look for pattern recognition
as well as battle scars.

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:40.332
And that's a term I ask
about in interviews.

00:07:40.332 --> 00:07:41.790
And then finally,
I think one thing

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:45.840
that's absolutely critical for
a leadership team is diversity.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.600
There's a lot of
research that says

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.276
that you have a better financial
outcome, a better business

00:07:51.276 --> 00:07:53.650
outcome when you have a diverse
team, because people come

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:55.560
with different
perspectives, and so I think

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.200
all of those elements are
key to the way I think

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.110
about constructing the team.

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:02.780
MARY GROVE: The diversity
point is very well-taken.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:04.620
I know that the
data does show us

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.760
that it really is better
for business, not just

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.040
the right thing to do.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.300
And you've been
outspoken on this issue.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:14.510
Have you seen progress in the
industry over the past year?

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:16.880
RUTH PORAT: A year is too
short a period of time.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:17.950
It's a great question.

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:19.890
I think what I've
seen a change--

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:21.530
the change in the
last year is there

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:23.710
is more discussion
about the fact

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.300
that it's not just
the right thing to do,

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.020
but it's right for business.

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:32.590
And I think as we
collectively try and figure

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:35.289
out how best to draw
men into the discussion,

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:37.000
it's a really
valuable point, which

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.070
is, if you want to be
the strongest leader,

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:40.330
you need a diverse team.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.121
You have to look at
the board of directors,

00:08:42.121 --> 00:08:44.580
your senior leadership
team, each of your teams.

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:47.710
And so it's helpful as
we're trying to then come up

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:50.230
with what are the concrete
steps that we can collectively

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:51.750
take to make a difference?

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:52.520
MARY GROVE: Right.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.590
How many women in
this room have started

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.420
a company, started
an organization,

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:59.430
started their own venture?

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:00.260
Great.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.017
So what advice, Ruth, do you
have for young founders who

00:09:03.017 --> 00:09:04.600
are just starting
out, especially when

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.650
thinking about
building diverse teams?

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:08.556
Often there's
discussion of, gosh,

00:09:08.556 --> 00:09:10.180
do you have to make
trade-offs in order

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:11.240
to build a diverse team?

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.240
And I emphatically think
that's not the case.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.700
But how do you advise
leaders to think

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.840
about building an
organization with that in mind

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:19.717
from the get go?

00:09:19.717 --> 00:09:22.050
RUTH PORAT: I think there are
two parts to your question

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:23.890
which are really important.

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:31.700
I think the first one is, how do
you build a super successful--

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.120
how do you succeed?

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.790
If I start at kind
of the highest level

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:36.720
and then go to the next
part of your question,

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.000
which is diversity.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
I think it is critical
that each of us,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.590
whether founding a
company, in a company,

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:46.970
at every point in my career,
that we have sponsors.

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:49.380
We have people who
will take risk on us.

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:52.520
We will have people who are
in positions of authority

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.170
and can give us those
breakaway opportunities.

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:56.690
And in my career
I'm often asked,

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:58.180
how did I know when
to move around?

00:09:58.180 --> 00:09:59.020
I didn't.

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:02.880
I had somebody who was in
a position of authority who

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.230
was willing to take
risk on me, who gave me

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:06.850
the opportunity,
who said, I'm going

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:09.500
to be your senior air cover.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.290
One guy did that and
it was super valuable.

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:14.602
Another one said, you're
going to sink or swim,

00:10:14.602 --> 00:10:16.060
and that's all
right because you're

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:17.910
going to learn, no
matter what happens.

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:19.390
And I'm there for you.

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:21.430
And so to me, the
starting point is,

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:23.680
make sure whether you're
starting a company

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.610
or in a company, that
you have people there

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:27.910
who have your back,
who have that pattern

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:29.980
recognition, that
experience, who are

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.860
taking a personal risk on you.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.580
That is the single most
important thing I can say.

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.420
The first position I
had at Morgan Stanley,

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.340
I worked for a guy on a deal.

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:42.310
And I worked around
the clock and never

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:44.020
even went to internal meetings.

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:45.840
And about a month
or two into it,

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.930
I finally got to go
to an internal meeting

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:49.100
with the managing director.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:51.200
And the managing director
looked at him and said,

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.430
is this the I that I
keep hearing about?

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:54.710
And it was my wake-up moment.

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:57.620
This guy had been taking
credit for my work.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:00.700
And what it really
taught me at an early age

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:03.190
is, women in particular,
I think we have a tendency

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:04.840
to put our head down,
work really hard,

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.652
and expect good
things will happen.

00:11:06.652 --> 00:11:08.360
And if you're working
for the wrong boss,

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.390
that's not going to happen.

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:11.580
If you don't have people out
there who have your back,

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:12.704
that's not going to happen.

00:11:12.704 --> 00:11:14.890
So the most
important message is,

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:17.390
make sure you're working with
someone who has your back.

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:20.247
Make sure they're super
confident in themselves,

00:11:20.247 --> 00:11:22.580
because if they're not, it's
going to be harder for them

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:24.080
to put themselves out there.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:27.970
Most-- not most, all of
my sponsors have been men.

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:30.450
And the reason is,
as I was growing up

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:32.110
through the
organization, there just

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:34.990
weren't women in
senior positions.

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:39.500
And so your sponsors don't
need to look like you to still

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.240
be in a position to help you.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.830
And so I think those
are critical elements.

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:47.450
And then your other point, which
is so important, diversity.

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:48.980
I agree with you.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.760
It's not a trade-off.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:54.710
We can look for the best
talent and round out our team.

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:58.190
And I think that notion that you
can have tunnel vision if you

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:01.280
don't have diversity
by gender, by race,

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.860
by socioeconomic background,
by sexual orientation--

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.580
there are lot of different
ways we can bring diversity

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:09.370
into your decision-making
team, and it's really important

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:10.339
to do that.

00:12:10.339 --> 00:12:11.880
MARY GROVE: So to
your earlier point,

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.080
the first point about
sponsors-- and you and I

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.760
have spoken before about
how the process of getting

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.480
a sponsor, which is different
from a mentor-- both

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.361
are important-- is
somewhat organic.

00:12:21.361 --> 00:12:23.110
You don't just walk
up to someone and say,

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:24.490
will you be my sponsor?

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:26.900
So I thought you've
had really great advice

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:29.270
about how to
advocate for yourself

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:31.340
and how to provide updates.

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:33.862
Can you elaborate a bit
on that for our audience?

00:12:33.862 --> 00:12:35.320
RUTH PORAT: I will,
but I think you

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.570
made a really important point.

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:38.370
I think some people
struggle with,

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:40.100
can you just walk up
to somebody and say,

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.780
will you be my sponsor?

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:43.580
And the reason I
completely agree

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:47.810
with you is, your sponsor
is taking risk on you.

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:49.800
And so they need to
know who you are.

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.960
You need to have earned
the opportunity for them

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:54.130
to actually put
themselves in a position

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:55.610
where it could hurt
them personally

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:58.120
or professionally if
you drop the ball.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.680
And so I completely
agree with you,

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.620
you got to earn that right.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:05.540
I think there are a couple
of really important elements,

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:07.270
in particular, for women.

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:13.080
One is, too often, as I said, we
put our heads down, work hard,

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:16.820
and expect good things
will occur and be noticed.

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:21.210
Men do a much
better job providing

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:23.430
the head of a group,
the head of a business,

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:26.390
with updates about what
they're doing than do women.

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:29.970
And when I first was in a
position running a group,

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:31.690
it really struck
me how often I'd

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:35.410
get these really pithy, little
nice updates from the men.

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:38.200
I just did this deal,
just had this win, just

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.410
accomplished whatever.

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:41.190
And I wasn't getting
them from the women.

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:43.064
And I went out and spoke
to a number of women

00:13:43.064 --> 00:13:44.980
and said, why aren't
you doing this?

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:45.534
The guys are.

00:13:45.534 --> 00:13:47.700
And the answer was, well,
it seems really political.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.770
And my answer is,
it's not political.

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:50.840
It's content.

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:54.579
And as a leader running
a large organization,

00:13:54.579 --> 00:13:56.870
I won't know what you're
doing if you don't talk about.

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:57.370
It.

00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:58.610
So please let me know.

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:00.610
Keep it pithy.

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:03.530
And if it's uncomfortable
to talk about yourself, say,

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:07.320
I want to highlight this great
thing that our team got done,

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.920
you know, my team
is extraordinary.

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:12.220
So you can make it about the
team, which it usually is.

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:14.160
So one is speaking up.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.280
There's an expression one
of my clients once used,

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.640
which is, the absence
of information

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:20.980
is filled with dirt.

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:23.072
And I use that
expression all the time.

00:14:23.072 --> 00:14:25.030
In fact, my kids are
tired of hearing about it,

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:26.740
because if they're home
after midnight, I'll say,

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:28.460
the absence of information
is filled with dirt,

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:30.610
so I assume they're obviously
dead on the side of a road,

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:31.359
which they aren't.

00:14:31.359 --> 00:14:32.150
They're just out.

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:34.070
But it's a really
important message,

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:37.110
because if we don't communicate,
we don't say something,

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:40.950
and the guys are, they're
filling it in and we are not.

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:43.320
So make sure you communicate.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.120
Don't hold back.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.000
The second really
important one is

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.320
that when you're ready
for that next role,

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.562
I think it's really
important to say something.

00:14:52.562 --> 00:14:54.770
And when you have a sponsor,
it makes it much easier.

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:57.120
What I used to do
is say, you know,

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:59.300
I'm kind of ready for
that next challenge.

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:00.470
I love to learn.

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:01.850
What's my highest and best use?

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:03.780
I'm open for anything
whenever it comes up.

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:06.140
It wasn't like, I need
x and I need it now.

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:09.850
It's what's my
highest and best use?

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:13.840
And the other thing I've
found with women versus men

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:17.190
is, I think we-- and
I will blame myself

00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:19.480
in early days-- you
kind of say it once

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.930
and you think it's
registered, whereas men

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:24.010
are really repetitive.

00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:25.940
It's like a war of attrition.

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:29.700
Every single week, back at
you until you respond to it.

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:35.106
And so what I'm telling men is,
if you hear a woman ask, think

00:15:35.106 --> 00:15:36.980
of it as like she's
screaming from a rooftop,

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.438
and the next time
you hear, she may

00:15:38.438 --> 00:15:41.260
be leaving the organization,
whereas men will just

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:42.830
do this war of attrition thing.

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:45.590
But what I tell women is,
increase the frequency

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:47.830
if you're ready for a
move, you're getting bored,

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:50.050
don't get to the point where
you just kind of give up

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:51.130
on where you are.

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:51.885
Ask for it.

00:15:51.885 --> 00:15:54.246
I think that's another
really important element.

00:15:54.246 --> 00:15:56.620
MARY GROVE: I think that's
such insightful advice for all

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.940
of us as women,
but also as women,

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.870
when we reach leadership
roles or management positions,

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:03.060
to keep an eye out for that.

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:04.976
And if we're not getting
that type of feedback

00:16:04.976 --> 00:16:07.320
from the women on our team,
to go out and practically

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.790
seek it, and encourage
the frequent updates,

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:10.900
the advocating.

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.941
RUTH PORAT: Well, that's
a really important point

00:16:12.941 --> 00:16:14.380
and it prompts another one.

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:16.390
And data research
supports this one, too.

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:18.070
Women tend to-- we
collectively tend

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:20.270
to think we need to
have 100% of the skills

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:23.490
before we're ready to say, I'm
ready for my next challenge,

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:26.160
whereas men need 25%
to 50% of the skills

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.790
and their hands
are up in the air.

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:29.610
So your point's a
really important one.

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:30.900
We may wait too long.

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:33.850
And I think even
when we're asked,

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:35.900
too often I find women
will say, I'm not ready.

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:37.320
And my response has
been, well, then, you're

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.778
telling me that I'm an idiot
because I think you are ready.

00:16:39.778 --> 00:16:42.069
So let's have this
conversation one more time.

00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:44.110
So even when you think
you're not ready, you are.

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:44.630
Think of it.

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:47.440
The guys only need 25% to 50%.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.620
We're thinking we need 100%.

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:49.850
There's a big gulf in there.

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:53.349
So your point, I
completely agree with.

00:16:53.349 --> 00:16:55.140
MARY GROVE: I know a
lot of women at Google

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.820
look at you in the most senior
level of leadership and think,

00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:58.930
that's so inspirational.

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:00.380
Whether or not
I've ever met you,

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:03.367
had a conversation with
you, I can look up to you.

00:17:03.367 --> 00:17:05.200
So you being in that
position of leadership,

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.859
who do you look up to?

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:10.839
Who are some of your main
influences and role models?

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:13.339
RUTH PORAT: This is not supposed
to be a political statement

00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:15.319
because I've been answering
this question for a really

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:16.990
long time, well
before the election,

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:18.760
but-- just so you
know what I'm going.

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.670
Hillary Clinton was
my senator, and I've

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:25.670
been a supporter of hers
for a really long time.

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:28.930
And when she became
secretary of state,

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:30.750
she did something
that I've talked

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:32.450
about in a different
context that I

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:33.720
think is really important.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.660
To be identified
as a great leader,

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:38.900
I think we each need to do
a brilliant job in our role.

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.650
And I call that our sandbox.

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:43.210
But then you need to go
outside of your sandbox

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:45.860
and really push the frontier
and take on something bigger

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:48.150
to actually make your
organization better

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:49.351
as a result.

00:17:49.351 --> 00:17:50.850
And when she was
secretary of state,

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:53.720
she had her day job, which
is a pretty big day job.

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.340
And then she was also
focused on global women.

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:59.150
And to me, if she could
be secretary of state

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:01.800
and have this other
agenda, that's

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:04.580
exactly, in my view, what we
each need to be thinking about.

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:07.270
How do we do what we do and
do it really brilliantly?

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:08.860
And how do we make
the organization

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:11.620
that we're part of better as
a result of us being there?

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:15.590
So I would say she's the one.

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:17.630
MARY GROVE: She's
an impressive woman.

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:18.700
Absolutely.

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:21.440
So prior to joining Google,
you were called Wall Street's

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.880
most powerful woman.

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:26.520
And I'm wondering, in
moments of great adversity,

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.620
great personal challenge, how
do you maintain your power,

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:32.060
maintain your strength?

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:34.870
RUTH PORAT: Well, I
think times of adversity

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:38.440
are the greatest times to
learn, and to mobilize,

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.540
and to pull a team
together, and to have a win.

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:46.610
And they're the most
poignant parts of my career.

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:50.150
So I had the opportunity,
during the financial crisis,

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:52.070
the secretary of the
treasury at the time,

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:55.070
Hank Paulson, asked if I would
help lead a team to advise them

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:58.210
what to do with the housing
market, Fannie Mae and Freddie

00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:00.830
Mac, a small $5
trillion industry.

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:02.250
And then from
there we went right

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:06.650
into the Lehman crisis weekend
and then the AIG weekend.

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:09.030
AIG was the scariest
moment throughout

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:10.100
the financial crisis.

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:11.120
It was terrifying.

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.610
And the reason it
was terrifying--

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:14.100
and I am getting
to your question--

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:15.516
the reason it was
terrifying is it

00:19:15.516 --> 00:19:18.342
felt like individuals and small
businesses would be wiped out

00:19:18.342 --> 00:19:19.550
and they never saw it coming.

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:21.890
And I was sitting there
feeling like we really

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:24.500
were in the midst
of what was going

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.920
to be a horrendous meltdown.

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.410
And so many people would suffer.

00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:30.660
It was the most
frightening moment.

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:33.710
And beyond the, how
do you mobilize a team

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:36.160
to problem solve,
which gets you focused,

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.240
the other thing that
was really important

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:42.570
is, I was thinking of my family,
and thinking, wow, everything's

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:43.550
going to get wiped out.

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:44.758
And I thought, you know what?

00:19:44.758 --> 00:19:47.690
We have our health I have
three amazing children.

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:49.300
Been married for a
really long time.

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:51.590
I don't have any regrets
about anything I've done.

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:53.970
And I think that
question-- and I've

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:56.910
framed it that way in the
past-- is don't have regrets.

00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:58.820
Don't put off your
life for another day.

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:01.480
Don't put off for
this time when things

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:04.070
are going to be fine, because
you just don't know what's

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:05.890
going to happen along the way.

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:08.390
So I think problem
solving is one part of it.

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:12.420
And I actually think you learn
so much in times of adversity.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.650
And don't forget to think
about how much you're

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:16.106
learning and getting stronger.

00:20:16.106 --> 00:20:17.730
And then make sure,
though, that you've

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:20.810
done everything in your life
that you want so that you don't

00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:23.570
question, well, why did I wait?

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:24.820
MARY GROVE: Absolutely.

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:27.400
So you talked about navigating
the financial crisis.

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:30.690
Now your purview is looking
after the finances of Alphabet.

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:32.050
No small task.

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:35.100
So can you share with us a
couple, maybe, life hacks

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:37.760
for how you personally
prioritize your time

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:40.224
and how you manage
your schedule?

00:20:40.224 --> 00:20:41.640
RUTH PORAT: That's
been a journey.

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:46.060
I can tell you I have tried
a lot of different things.

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:48.210
But there are two.

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:50.560
First, I think
women-- at least I'll

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:54.010
say for myself-- really
bad at saying no.

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:58.520
And one of my--I actually have
it on my to do list-- say no.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:00.050
Because there are
a lot of really

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:02.340
cool things that we get to do.

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:04.177
And it's really easy,
and I love to learn.

00:21:04.177 --> 00:21:06.260
So it's like, well, I'll
do that and I'll do that.

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:07.635
And then all of
a sudden you find

00:21:07.635 --> 00:21:10.130
you really don't have enough
time to live your life.

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:12.817
And so that's one thing,
is having the discipline

00:21:12.817 --> 00:21:14.400
to make sure the bar
is high enough so

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.310
that when you're doing something
you're not overextended.

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:19.780
And I have found that to
be a learning experience.

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:24.307
And the other is, start each
year with a set of priorities.

00:21:24.307 --> 00:21:26.890
For me, it's kind of, what are
the five things that are really

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:28.490
important to get
accomplished where

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:32.100
I can make a real
difference here at Alphabet?

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:32.910
And keep them.

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:34.180
They're on my to-do list.

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:35.310
So I have a to-do list.

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:38.800
It's got everybody I deal
with and the key things

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.080
I need to talk to them about.

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:43.800
And I go through that every day,
and it's this constant process,

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:46.070
so if I'm talking to you,
I'll pull out the things

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:47.690
that we had dealt with before.

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:50.840
But also on that are my
work priorities for the year

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:52.760
and my family
priorities for the year.

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:55.320
And I always look
back at those as well.

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:56.840
And it keeps you
kind of grounded

00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:59.570
so that you don't end up getting
overextended, at least for me.

00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:00.610
MARY GROVE: All on
the same list, though,

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:01.680
work and family together.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:06.140
So it's not this notion of
a work-life bifurcation,

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:06.790
so to speak.

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:08.045
RUTH PORAT: Well, my
first time I did it,

00:22:08.045 --> 00:22:10.320
I had the work stuff on the
left and the family stuff

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.450
on the right.

00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:13.340
And it's sort of
evolved over time.

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:15.330
But it's one integrated thing.

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:17.454
MARY GROVE: So if you only
get to pick five things,

00:22:17.454 --> 00:22:18.790
how high level is each bucket?

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:20.420
RUTH PORAT: They're
pretty high level.

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:20.680
MARY GROVE: It's a lot.

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:22.210
RUTH PORAT: There's a lot there.

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:22.820
MARY GROVE: Absolutely.

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:24.444
So I want to shift
gears a bit and talk

00:22:24.444 --> 00:22:26.994
a little bit about the
economic environment right now.

00:22:26.994 --> 00:22:29.410
As we've seen, we have a lot
of entrepreneurs in the room.

00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:32.842
So I want to ask you, do you
think that current startup

00:22:32.842 --> 00:22:34.800
valuations-- especially
here in Silicon Valley,

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:37.640
there's been so much talk
and so much hype-- do

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.840
you think that they
are A, reasonable,

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:43.010
and are they sustainable?

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:46.880
RUTH PORAT: If you go back over
the history of startups, what

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:50.210
you'll find-- and Mary
Meeker was the research

00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:52.910
analyst at Morgan Stanley when
I was running tech banking back

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:56.440
in the '90s, and she used to
always make this point-- is

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:59.090
something like 70% fail.

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:00.380
70% of startups fail.

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:03.000
90% of the value is created
by 10% of the companies.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.790
There's a really
high bar for success.

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:06.960
It is hard.

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.860
And I think the key lesson
I learned back in the '90s,

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:14.470
in that bubble, was that a
lot of companies were started.

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:17.170
But there really wasn't
anything that was truly

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:18.740
differentiating about them.

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:21.180
At the time, it was the
early days of the internet,

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:23.000
and people thought that if
you're using the internet,

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.130
you're an internet company.

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:26.650
But if you weren't doing
anything transformative,

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:28.470
the internet, as we
subsequently learned,

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:31.550
was like you launched a catalog.

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:34.630
There was really nothing new
and differentiating about it.

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:38.750
And the key thing that I spent
a lot of time on as a banker,

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:41.560
is this a company or
is this a product?

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:44.760
And so I think for
great companies,

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:48.720
you're going to find there'll
be a lot of interest,

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:51.670
and valuation can be
sustainable, in particular

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:55.330
given how much larger the
market is today than it was.

00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:57.800
But you have to go back
to, in an environment where

00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:00.104
a lot of things can get
funded, do you actually

00:24:00.104 --> 00:24:01.520
have something
that's sustainable?

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:05.670
And there are times where
there's a blurring of that.

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:08.440
But the great companies
will transcend

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:11.560
whatever these kind of peaks
and valleys are in markets.

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:13.400
MARY GROVE: So what
are the primary lessons

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:16.800
that we should all remember
from the bubble of 2000?

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:19.510
And do you think we're
in a bubble today?

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:22.340
RUTH PORAT: So the main
one from the bubble of 2000

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:27.350
is that, do you have something
that is truly differentiated?

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:28.104
Is it a product?

00:24:28.104 --> 00:24:28.770
Is it a company?

00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:31.720
What makes it so differentiated?

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:35.320
And make sure you're
getting-- make

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.620
sure you've got good people
around you who can provide

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:40.210
some lateral vision,
who can give you

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:42.090
the benefit of a
lot of the scars

00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:44.720
they've gotten going through a
whole host of experience, who

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.640
will truly challenge you.

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:50.020
I have often said, I like
people who are in my face,

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:53.080
because none of us have a
monopoly on great ideas.

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.220
And if somebody is
not challenging me,

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:58.740
I'm not going to get
pushed as far as I would

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:00.840
want if you want to succeed.

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:03.740
So that's probably the
most important from 2000.

00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:05.560
There are a couple
that are really

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.820
important from the crisis of
2008, the financial crisis.

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:10.990
And I quote those
all the time as well.

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:13.160
The first and
really important one

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:16.720
is how important it is to
build a solid foundation

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.930
for your company well
ahead of when you need it.

00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:21.340
Any great company, I
believe, in any industry

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:22.644
will fail if you don't do that.

00:25:22.644 --> 00:25:24.060
And the metaphor
is, you would not

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:27.190
drive a car at 100 miles an
hour with mud on the windshield

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:28.920
because you can't see
where you're going.

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:31.420
And if you haven't built a good
foundation for your company,

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:33.490
you don't know when you're
about to hit a wall.

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:36.330
And you really need to
invest in boring stuff

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:38.760
like financial control
systems, risk management,

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.980
those kinds of things
that give you visibility.

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:43.130
That's one really
important lesson.

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:44.690
And the other very
important lesson

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:46.480
from the financial
crisis is something

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:50.940
Hank Paulson said
to me, which was,

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:54.140
you need to have the will and
the means to solve a problem.

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:56.180
And too often, by the
time you have the will,

00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:57.830
you no longer have the means.

00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:59.320
And he was talking about Greece.

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:03.310
There was no will to solve
Greece in the early days.

00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:04.960
We had the financial
means to do it,

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.540
but we didn't have
the will to do it.

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:10.640
And as a result, it spread to
Italy and Spain and Portugal.

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:14.290
It became a contagion
across southern Europe.

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:17.060
And his point, you have to
have the will and the means,

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:19.350
why is that relevant
to your question?

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:21.970
I think it is relevant because--
and it goes back to my answer

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:24.200
to your first
question-- we at Google,

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.960
at Alphabet, have $73 billion.

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:28.660
We can do a whole
host of things.

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:30.980
But if we don't
prioritize, we're

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:35.090
going to spend a lot
of resources on things

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:36.900
down on the bottom of the list.

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:39.756
We're going to dissipate
the means, as opposed

00:26:39.756 --> 00:26:41.880
to putting all of our weight
behind the big things.

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:46.110
And so prioritization, for all
of us, is really important.

00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:48.090
And I would say when you
don't have the means,

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:50.200
it becomes even more important.

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:51.850
So I think that there
are some lessons

00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:54.740
from the financial
crisis that actually

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:58.340
may be at least as relevant as
from that early tech bubble.

00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:00.510
MARY GROVE: Think about
longevity, staying power,

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:04.210
prioritization-- I'm a work
in progress there for sure.

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:07.090
So in a few minutes I'm going to
switch over and take questions

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:07.840
from the audience.

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.673
And I think we have
some microphone runners.

00:27:09.673 --> 00:27:12.330
If you have a question,
please get that ready.

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:14.920
But I want to ask
you a few fun ones.

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:16.952
So I'd love to know
what book you're

00:27:16.952 --> 00:27:19.410
reading right now, and maybe
what's one book that you would

00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:21.950
recommend to us?

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:24.100
RUTH PORAT: Well, so one
that I am-- right now

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:26.280
I'm sort of still drowning
in everything Alphabet.

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:30.600
So I have a very good intention
and a book on my bedside.

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:32.220
I got to see the
play "Hamilton" when

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:35.080
I was in New York,
which is beyond amazing.

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.600
It was absolutely extraordinary.

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.349
So I'm now trying to
get through the book.

00:27:38.349 --> 00:27:41.510
So that would be the one that's
sitting there challenging me

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:42.540
all the time.

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:46.730
The one that I
thought was amazing,

00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:49.340
in terms of what
would I recommend,

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:50.547
I thought "Half the Sky."

00:27:50.547 --> 00:27:51.880
I think you read "Half the Sky."

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:52.230
MARY GROVE: I read it, yep.

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:52.860
RUTH PORAT: Yeah.

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:54.234
I mean, it's hard
to get through,

00:27:54.234 --> 00:27:57.740
but I thought it's one of
those ones where it really

00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:59.912
underscores how much
still needs to be done.

00:27:59.912 --> 00:28:00.870
MARY GROVE: Absolutely.

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:01.310
Absolutely.

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:03.020
RUTH PORAT: How would
you answer that question?

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:04.603
MARY GROVE: So
currently I'm reading--

00:28:04.603 --> 00:28:07.500
so Steve Case is about
to release a book called

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:10.800
"The Third Wave" about the
next cycle of entrepreneurship.

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:13.082
So I'm reading the
pre-release copy right now.

00:28:13.082 --> 00:28:14.040
RUTH PORAT: That's fun.

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:16.980
MARY GROVE: One book that I
would recommend in terms of-- I

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:20.150
really like to read fiction
for pleasure when I can--

00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:21.560
"In the Shadow of the Banyan."

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:23.809
It's a beautiful-- first-time
author, a brilliant book

00:28:23.809 --> 00:28:28.170
about her own personal struggle
in Cambodia during the Khmer

00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:29.250
Rouge.

00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:31.917
But it's a goal to
read more this year.

00:28:31.917 --> 00:28:33.410
RUTH PORAT: Exactly.

00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:38.410
MARY GROVE: So what is next
on your travel bucket list?

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:42.350
RUTH PORAT: So I had the
coolest trip this Christmas.

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:43.450
We went to Cuba.

00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:47.220
And next up is, if we can--
don't know if it's possible--

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:48.350
get to Iran.

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:52.560
One of the things-- I have
three boys who are amazing--

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:54.280
and one of the things
I've done with them

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.405
throughout their life,
starting from when they were

00:28:56.405 --> 00:28:58.790
able to actually play
this game, is every year

00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:01.200
we would have everyone
in the family list

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.590
what countries
you want to go to,

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:04.700
and then everyone got a vote.

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:06.280
And then we would
tally up the votes

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:07.604
and we would go somewhere.

00:29:07.604 --> 00:29:08.770
MARY GROVE: Very democratic.

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:10.560
RUTH PORAT: It was
very democratic.

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:14.720
But I think that giving
them an appreciation

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:17.510
for the rest of the
world, and the fact

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:20.000
that we're just a small part
of it, was really important,

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.580
and it's been a fun game we've
played for a really long time.

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:24.830
MARY GROVE: So will they be
coming to Tehran with you?

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:26.500
RUTH PORAT: If we get to go.

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:27.497
They loved Cuba.

00:29:27.497 --> 00:29:28.330
That was a good one.

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:29.930
If you haven't been,
I would go soon.

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:31.440
MARY GROVE: It's
on my bucket list.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.850
So what are three sites
that you visit first thing

00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:36.290
every morning?

00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:39.000
RUTH PORAT: So I have a--
I think it's a good habit.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.650
Some may say it's a
slightly odd habit.

00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:42.274
Before I get out of
bed in the morning,

00:29:42.274 --> 00:29:44.490
I make sure I get through news.

00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:46.580
So beyond my great
Google News search,

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:48.850
which gives me every
category I want,

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:53.170
I'll read "The New York Times"
morning blast and Politico.

00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:57.850
And because I grew up on Wall
Street, "The Financial Times."

00:29:57.850 --> 00:30:00.100
MARY GROVE: Is that your
favorite finance publication?

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:01.419
RUTH PORAT: Yes.

00:30:01.419 --> 00:30:03.210
MARY GROVE: Last question
from me, for now.

00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:07.350
What are three apps that
you can't live without?

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:09.070
RUTH PORAT: Well,
everything Google,

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:11.510
across the board,
which is actually true.

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:11.660
MARY GROVE: I feel like
I'm cheating on that one.

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:13.600
RUTH PORAT: I know.

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:15.220
That's probably the bulk of it.

00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:17.770
And then I would say
I live a lot on Uber.

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:20.650
MARY GROVE: Great.

00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:23.430
So I'd love to turn it over
to our audience for questions.

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:26.989
You can raise your hand if
you have a question for Ruth.

00:30:26.989 --> 00:30:27.780
Here in the corner?

00:30:31.046 --> 00:30:31.960
Green microphone.

00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:38.049
AUDIENCE: I was
really curious if you

00:30:38.049 --> 00:30:40.090
could talk a little bit
more about the difference

00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:43.160
between a company and a product,
and maybe give some examples

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:46.600
or features of both.

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:48.260
RUTH PORAT: Great question.

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:52.080
So without naming
names, there were

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:56.510
a number of large
companies in the '90s who

00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:59.759
felt that if they took their
dot-com business public-- think

00:30:59.759 --> 00:31:01.800
of any of the consumer
products goods companies--

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:03.870
they took their dot-com
business public,

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:06.490
it would go for some
super high valuation.

00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:09.140
And my point-- that's
a simple example of,

00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:10.710
that's just a
distribution channel no

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:12.060
different than a catalog.

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:14.380
So what are you doing that's
actually transformative?

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:17.040
Amazon did something
that was fundamentally

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:19.510
transformative in the
experience that you had.

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:22.390
They weren't doing much
that was differentiated.

00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:24.679
eBay did something,
created a whole new market.

00:31:24.679 --> 00:31:26.220
Priceline created
a whole new market,

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:30.011
a whole new way of thinking
about how you could consume,

00:31:30.011 --> 00:31:30.510
acquire.

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:32.300
So for example, I
took Priceline public.

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:35.070
And what was fascinating
to me was it started

00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:37.960
as just this narrow vertical.

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:40.630
But they could connect
the dots to the future.

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:43.630
What more could you do once
you've kind of gone down

00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:44.220
this path?

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:51.350
And that's probably
one part of it.

00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:53.990
The other is, if the problem
you're solving is too small,

00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:58.550
so it's a nice feature, it's a
nice add-on to an experience,

00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:00.505
the question is, how big
does it really scale?

00:32:00.505 --> 00:32:02.880
So when you start by saying,
what's the total addressable

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:03.210
market?

00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:04.530
How big could this really be?

00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:08.410
If it's too narrow, then you
end up saying, that's cool.

00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:11.750
That's a nice, cool company.

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:14.190
But fundamentally, it
would have more reach

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:16.700
if it plugged into
something broader.

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:19.015
So it just solves a
slice of a problem.

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:23.914
MARY GROVE: Yellow microphone.

00:32:23.914 --> 00:32:25.330
AUDIENCE: So my
name is [? Snow ?]

00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:29.310
and I'm an Android developer
at Groupon right now.

00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:30.910
I have two questions for you.

00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:34.310
The first, you said you
have a list of priorities

00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:37.200
for both your work and family.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:42.300
Could you share with us, at
least, maybe top one of each?

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:46.700
And the second thing is,
you have a really busy life

00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:47.470
at work, right?

00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:52.520
Like how do you manage to kind
of balance your personal life?

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:55.520
Like how do you find
your love of life,

00:32:55.520 --> 00:33:01.860
and then how do you manage your
family time, things like that?

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:04.900
RUTH PORAT: I'm glad you
asked that because the word

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:07.780
balance, I think, is one
thing I would love everyone

00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:09.550
in this room to get rid of.

00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:11.130
Banish from your vocabulary.

00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:14.350
I think the term balance,
which is often used,

00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:17.360
is a trap, because we
can never be balanced.

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:22.630
I think-- my view is
that too often-- I'll

00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:24.614
say for myself-- I feel
guilty all the time

00:33:24.614 --> 00:33:26.280
that I'm not doing
enough for my family,

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:27.800
or I'm not doing
enough for work.

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:33.460
And I think women often do feel
very guilty, get that sense of,

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:35.020
I should be doing more here.

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:36.280
Men don't do it as much.

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:42.625
Men do a great job of just kind
of compartmentalizing things.

00:33:42.625 --> 00:33:44.750
And there are a lot of
lessons that come from that.

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:47.990
But sticking with your question,
I don't view it as balance.

00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:48.860
I view it as mix.

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:52.310
My view is that at
different times in life,

00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:54.840
you're kind of more
one or more the other.

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:56.800
And the metaphor--
I like to think

00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:00.410
in metaphors-- but the metaphor
for me is a kaleidoscope.

00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:02.967
If the kaleidoscope had
half yellow and half blue,

00:34:02.967 --> 00:34:04.050
it would be pretty boring.

00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:06.466
If it had all yellow and all
blue, it would be even worse.

00:34:06.466 --> 00:34:08.449
But even if it was
just perfectly equal,

00:34:08.449 --> 00:34:10.090
nicely balanced.

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:12.330
Instead, it's a lot
of different colors.

00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:14.800
And as you move throughout
life, it changes,

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:17.090
and that's what makes
it really beautiful.

00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:19.230
And I was really fortunate.

00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:21.290
My mom worked when I was
growing up and always

00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:22.940
gave me the message
that I should work.

00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:25.584
And I love my mom
immensely, and I'm

00:34:25.584 --> 00:34:26.750
really close to my siblings.

00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:30.150
So it never occurred to me that
you couldn't be a great mom

00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:31.409
and have a great career.

00:34:31.409 --> 00:34:33.510
And my dad was
completely gender blind

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:38.030
and did math problems
and soldering circuitry

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:39.320
and really cool stuff with me.

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:42.380
So I was never
told anything other

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:44.739
than go forth and be
what you want to be.

00:34:44.739 --> 00:34:47.810
And when I was little,
my kids-- it was hard.

00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:50.699
I mean, there's no question,
when you're going to work,

00:34:50.699 --> 00:34:52.159
you have those bad days.

00:34:52.159 --> 00:34:57.280
I was reminiscing about my
middle kid when he was little.

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.690
They're now all in their 20s.

00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:01.670
But when he was
little, one day he

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:03.130
said, mommy, why do you work?

00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:07.550
And I thought, what a great
time for a learning moment.

00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:10.760
I work because I
love to help clients

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.280
and I love to solve
their problems.

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:14.610
And I work with
really fun people.

00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:16.540
And he reflected
on it and he said,

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:18.670
so mommy, it comes down
to that one word, love.

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:20.210
Who do you love more?

00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:22.840
Which was clearly
not the response

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:24.830
that I was looking for.

00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:27.470
But if you fast
forward to when we

00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:30.080
were going through the
financial crisis, they got it.

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:32.456
They knew that I was in the
middle of something that

00:35:32.456 --> 00:35:33.330
was really important.

00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:36.860
They were so there and they were
proud, and they really got it.

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:39.330
And we're super close.

00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:42.680
And I think that
my husband and I

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:46.060
have launched three boys,
three, I guess, young men now

00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:47.470
who have really good values.

00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:48.170
They get it.

00:35:48.170 --> 00:35:52.470
They see how wonderful
it is to have all of us

00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:53.740
be who we can be.

00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:57.410
So for me, this term balance--
the reason I jumped on it,

00:35:57.410 --> 00:36:01.150
I'm glad you used it-- is
because I think it's a trap.

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:04.310
Think about mix, and
it adjusts over time.

00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:05.960
And one of the very
important things

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:08.640
I think, as leaders,
we should all do,

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:11.580
is help women deal
with that guilt,

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:16.800
because-- what I have
set up in my prior role,

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.956
and I certainly have it
here-- is I tell women,

00:36:18.956 --> 00:36:21.080
you know what, if there's
something you want to do,

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:24.770
like whatever with the family,
a kid's birthday, a parent

00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:27.800
teacher conference, a sporting
event, whatever, don't tell me.

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.340
Just go do it,
because I trust you.

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:30.923
You're on my team
because I trust you.

00:36:30.923 --> 00:36:31.890
Don't check in with me.

00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:34.170
Women tend to check
in more often.

00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:36.670
Men just go do what
they need to do.

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:40.480
And so what I've told men is
you need to let everyone know,

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.290
don't check in with me.

00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:43.990
Go do what you need
to do, and view it

00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:47.380
as an investment in your
longevity at Alphabet,

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:50.410
at Morgan Stanley, at
wherever you happen to work.

00:36:50.410 --> 00:36:54.640
And over the years I've had
women send me a note saying,

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:57.000
I know I wasn't supposed
to check in with my boss,

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.480
but I've never done that so
I'm sending you an email just

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:02.270
to tell you that's really cool
advice but it's still hard.

00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:02.980
And I love it.

00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:04.521
I mean, it's like,
yeah, bring it on.

00:37:04.521 --> 00:37:05.100
It's fine.

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:07.605
Because it does feel a bit
odd if you're not there

00:37:07.605 --> 00:37:09.230
or you're cutting
out in the afternoon.

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:10.580
But the guys do it.

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:12.430
So feel good about
it, and view it

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:15.330
as an investment in the
longevity of your time

00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:17.200
at wherever it is
you're working.

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:19.060
I think it's really important.

00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:21.010
MARY GROVE: Thank you, Ruth.

00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:22.097
Next question.

00:37:22.097 --> 00:37:22.680
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:25.000
My name is [? Mina ?]
[? Kasi. ?] And

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000
I'm at the point of my career
where I'm transitioning from

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.780
an individual contributor
to management role.

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:35.880
So along that path, as you
said, you had several sponsors.

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:40.090
But at the same time, I'm
being viewed as a threat

00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:43.920
to other colleagues
competing for the same.

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:46.830
Because you have gone
up the ladder so much

00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:49.500
and you always had
sponsors, how did you

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:52.200
deal with any oppositions?

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:57.950
Or what was your way
around that problem?

00:37:57.950 --> 00:38:00.550
RUTH PORAT: Well, I think when
you're picked versus a guy,

00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:03.210
or when two guys are up for
a role, and one gets picked

00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:05.520
and the other doesn't,
there's obviously

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:08.450
disappointment and envy
and a whole host of things.

00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:13.250
I think that all we can do is
conduct ourselves as ethically

00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:15.120
and responsibly as possible.

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:16.770
I can't deal with their problem.

00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:17.740
Like you know what?

00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:21.240
If you're the one who should
get picked for the role,

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:22.710
do it in a high-quality way.

00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:25.040
Make sure you're super
inclusive of your team.

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:27.770
I think one of the
great things in leaders

00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:31.460
is, when you're a leader, one,
over-communicate with the team.

00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:33.310
Make sure they know
what your vision is.

00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:37.160
And when you're in a room, make
sure you get everybody's views

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:39.350
before you opine on yours.

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:42.460
If you've got the support of
your team, those snipers who

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:44.542
wish they had the role
but didn't get it,

00:38:44.542 --> 00:38:47.000
they're not going to get much
support for it because you're

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.350
going to be doing a great job.

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:51.400
So there have been
times in my career--

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:55.129
I came from an industry where
there were even fewer women.

00:38:55.129 --> 00:38:56.670
It was tougher in
those earlier years

00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:58.250
than, I would say,
in this industry.

00:38:58.250 --> 00:39:01.240
And fortunately all of these
industries are changing.

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:04.084
There were times when I tried
to even use to my advantage,

00:39:04.084 --> 00:39:06.250
well, you know, I'm a woman,
so they wanted a woman.

00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:07.920
I'm not sure that's
the best answer,

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:09.980
and I certainly am not
going to say I advocate.

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:11.820
In fact, I'm even
sorry I brought it up.

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:13.140
But you know what?

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:15.620
We can't deal with
the guys' problems.

00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:18.050
And we're just going
to move forward.

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:22.820
MARY GROVE: Yes, question
in the green microphone.

00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:26.612
AUDIENCE: Hey, my name is
[? Rosha. ?] I work at Udacity.

00:39:26.612 --> 00:39:28.600
Hey.

00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:32.090
So my question is, what
personality traits and skills

00:39:32.090 --> 00:39:34.430
you look for in a person
that would get you to say,

00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:36.780
I want to sponsor that
person, and I want

00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:39.135
to contribute to their success?

00:39:39.135 --> 00:39:41.260
MARY GROVE: [? Rosha ?] is
an amazing entrepreneur.

00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:43.343
We first met in Palestine,
and she lives here now.

00:39:43.343 --> 00:39:46.240
RUTH PORAT: Oh, cool.

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:50.520
It kind of goes
back to my comments.

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:54.550
I want someone who
is challenging,

00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:57.790
who's in my face with ideas.

00:39:57.790 --> 00:40:04.120
One of my favorite analysts
who worked for me-- actually,

00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:07.910
he's now here, came
here years before I did.

00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:09.780
Very wise guy, clearly.

00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:11.530
But you know, what
I really liked was,

00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:14.420
he was a very young kid
right out of college

00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:15.670
and I was a managing director.

00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:18.080
And he was constantly
peppering me with ideas,

00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:21.010
because as I said, none of
us have a monopoly on ideas.

00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:24.560
So I want people who give
me real operating leverage

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:27.290
by provoking great ideas.

00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:32.620
And I've often used the term
"think, don't process," which

00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:35.540
is a really crass
way of describing it,

00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:37.710
because I don't think
any of us just process.

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:41.090
But if you don't complete what
you're trying to do and then go

00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:44.630
the next level, so put yourself
in the more senior person's

00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:48.410
position and say, what
would I do if I were there?

00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:49.900
So this tells me a story.

00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:50.840
What's the next step?

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:54.572
Try and take it the next
step or the step beyond that.

00:40:54.572 --> 00:40:57.030
Once you're doing that, you're
providing a ton of operating

00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:57.890
leverage to people.

00:40:57.890 --> 00:41:00.760
So the eureka
moment for me was, I

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:03.210
was so grateful to my
sponsors-- and I am.

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:05.590
I wouldn't have had these
roles but for sponsors--

00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:07.110
until one day I
realized, I think

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:09.200
that guy's getting at
least as much out of me

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:10.880
as I am out of
this relationship.

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:13.520
It's a really fair relationship.

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:15.910
And that's when you
realize that it's working.

00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:18.370
So when you're
sponsoring someone,

00:41:18.370 --> 00:41:21.190
I've got a ton of
people, and it's probably

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:22.830
the most gratifying
part of my role,

00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:24.780
is people who keep
updating me from wherever

00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:27.745
they are in life who I've worked
with over the last 20 years.

00:41:27.745 --> 00:41:29.910
And it's because
they've got this spark

00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:32.170
and they're trying to
push it to the next level.

00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:38.010
And even people who come to
me-- for example, one guy,

00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:39.860
he kept coming up with ideas.

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:41.760
And I said to him,
I love the way

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:43.740
you think but your
ideas are too small.

00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:44.860
Think bigger.

00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:48.060
And so you just want to
provoke people to think,

00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:51.560
because if you can get them
to understand how big you want

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:54.110
to think, or which markets
you want to attack,

00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:57.300
they may miss the mark because
they're new at doing it,

00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:59.810
but you can redirect them.

00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:01.220
That's what I look for.

00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:03.140
And so it is this challenge.

00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:05.627
I want people who
are challenging.

00:42:05.627 --> 00:42:07.960
MARY GROVE: We have time for
one final audience question

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:10.130
in the purple microphone.

00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:13.550
AUDIENCE: So I wanted to get
your opinion of, or ideas,

00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:17.780
on that if you are somebody
who's working full-time

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:20.510
as a software developer,
how do you transition?

00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:23.980
How do you plan from
working from someone

00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:27.840
to having something of your
own, your own software service,

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:31.770
given the assumptions
that you have

00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:34.290
to plan all the
financial aspect of it,

00:42:34.290 --> 00:42:37.110
or you don't have a network.

00:42:37.110 --> 00:42:40.180
You can take the knowledge
of a guy in a garage,

00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:42.620
but we don't see a lot of
women in the garage creating

00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:43.570
something.

00:42:43.570 --> 00:42:47.390
So what's your thoughts on it?

00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:49.880
RUTH PORAT: Well, you may have,
given your role, a lot more

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:51.130
to add on this than I do.

00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:53.590
I mean, I keep coming
back to the same playbook

00:42:53.590 --> 00:42:57.270
in certain respects,
which is, you

00:42:57.270 --> 00:43:01.100
do need to be able
to address what's

00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:03.840
the technical model, what's
the business model, what's

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:06.800
the financial model,
what's the marketing model?

00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:09.400
Just one piece of the
puzzle doesn't solve it.

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:12.420
So whether you bring in
people who can do it,

00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:14.560
I think life is a team sport.

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:18.510
And I want to make sure that
I'm surrounded with people who

00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:20.060
are part of that team sport.

00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:24.470
And so I would make sure to
fill in what those gaps are.

00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:26.520
And there's a pretty
big network of people,

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:28.450
in particular, I
think, who want to see

00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:31.960
more women thriving and
rising up and really winning.

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:34.450
And that's a great place to be.

00:43:34.450 --> 00:43:35.944
MARY GROVE: I would say test.

00:43:35.944 --> 00:43:37.610
Test the concept early
and often, right?

00:43:37.610 --> 00:43:40.142
Put your ideas out there
with trusted people

00:43:40.142 --> 00:43:42.600
across different disciplines,
whether it's product, design,

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:44.520
engineering, the business side.

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:46.700
There are amazing forums
like startup weekends,

00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:49.360
these small boot camps where
you can go and actually

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:52.324
work on it in a mock scenario,
get real life feedback.

00:43:52.324 --> 00:43:53.740
And the third thing
is, maybe talk

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:56.220
with some potential angel
investors, friends and family,

00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:58.351
folks who have seen a lot
of these different types

00:43:58.351 --> 00:43:59.350
of pitches come through.

00:43:59.350 --> 00:44:01.058
And they may have a
lot of great feedback

00:44:01.058 --> 00:44:03.687
early on before you end
up taking that leap.

00:44:03.687 --> 00:44:05.770
RUTH PORAT: I just want
to say it's fabulous being

00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:06.380
with all of you.

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:07.504
What you're doing is great.

00:44:07.504 --> 00:44:09.720
We need to see more
women continuing

00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:11.100
to thrive in this industry.

00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:13.690
And it's a thrill and pleasure
to be with all of you.

00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:15.100
So congratulations
to all of you.

00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:16.660
MARY GROVE: And on
that note, Ruth,

00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:19.240
I want to ask you a
couple-- if I may.

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:19.865
RUTH PORAT: Oh.

00:44:19.865 --> 00:44:21.031
MARY GROVE: I like to close.

00:44:21.031 --> 00:44:23.090
RUTH PORAT: I thought we
had one last question.

00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:25.970
MARY GROVE: Well, I get to
sneak a couple in there.

00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:29.200
So I wanted to ask you
to do a small game I

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:30.590
have called Fill in the Blank.

00:44:30.590 --> 00:44:31.720
So I'm just going to give you--

00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:32.520
RUTH PORAT: Mad Libs.

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:33.395
We're doing Mad Libs.

00:44:33.395 --> 00:44:34.561
MARY GROVE: Brief statement.

00:44:34.561 --> 00:44:36.740
Give me the first word or
phrase that comes to mind.

00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:37.710
RUTH PORAT: OK.

00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:39.740
MARY GROVE: So if I
started the company today,

00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:43.170
it would be focused on--

00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:44.900
RUTH PORAT: So can
I violate the rule?

00:44:47.197 --> 00:44:49.030
MARY GROVE: Don't ask
for permission, right?

00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:50.238
RUTH PORAT: Oh yeah, exactly.

00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:54.420
My mom was an entrepreneur.

00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:57.600
And I have so much
respect for entrepreneurs.

00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:59.490
And I think people
who are entrepreneurs

00:44:59.490 --> 00:45:01.910
should go off, and
break down those walls,

00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:04.010
and build these great
ideas, and bring

00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:05.850
in whatever you need to do it.

00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:08.020
I love my role,
and I'm not going

00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:11.930
to go be another role
because I love what I do.

00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:15.130
And I feel like the
opportunity to be

00:45:15.130 --> 00:45:18.490
a part of this great
company, making

00:45:18.490 --> 00:45:20.170
sure we've got that
great foundation,

00:45:20.170 --> 00:45:22.570
making sure that mud
is off the windshield,

00:45:22.570 --> 00:45:25.535
solving whatever capital
structure, business capital

00:45:25.535 --> 00:45:27.580
allocation, I love
that part of it.

00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:29.420
And I love the fact
that I work with people

00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:32.220
who are amazing engineers
and entrepreneurs.

00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:34.100
And I think the most
important thing is

00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:36.160
to be super true to yourself.

00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:41.240
And so that's my one-word
answer to your question.

00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:44.430
MARY GROVE: So
leadership to me means--

00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:48.060
RUTH PORAT: Leadership means
courage, because by the time

00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:50.640
it gets to your office,
it's not an easy--

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:52.500
you never get the easy things.

00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:54.490
But you better make a
decision, because there's

00:45:54.490 --> 00:45:57.720
nothing worse than things
just sort of dragging on.

00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:00.890
It means being really inclusive.

00:46:00.890 --> 00:46:04.060
As I said, I think pulling
the best ideas out,

00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:06.372
that's what great leaders do.

00:46:06.372 --> 00:46:07.830
And it's knowing
where you're going

00:46:07.830 --> 00:46:10.900
with clarity, which often comes
from that process of pulling

00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:11.900
things out.

00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:15.270
MARY GROVE: My final one is,
my hope for the next generation

00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:17.780
of female leaders is--

00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:20.170
RUTH PORAT: Everything
that we all want it to be.

00:46:20.170 --> 00:46:24.860
I think that the pendulum
has moved a lot from when

00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:26.670
my mom was working.

00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:30.810
And it's certainly moved
a lot from when I started.

00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:33.060
And there's such a
great network of women

00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:36.850
that want to see all of
you, and the next generation

00:46:36.850 --> 00:46:40.570
coming up, not asking
these questions about,

00:46:40.570 --> 00:46:42.820
what does it mean
as a woman versus--

00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:45.324
just that it's so natural and
seamless and everything else.

00:46:45.324 --> 00:46:47.240
And until that time,
we're all locked in arms,

00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:48.850
I think, in a really
important way.

00:46:48.850 --> 00:46:52.210
So I want huge
success, and I want

00:46:52.210 --> 00:46:54.200
us to be running the
world because we're

00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:55.495
better at it than anyone else.

00:46:55.495 --> 00:46:56.132
How's that?

00:46:56.132 --> 00:46:57.965
MARY GROVE: Thank you
very much, Ruth Porat.

00:46:57.965 --> 00:46:58.465
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:58.465 --> 00:47:01.190
RUTH PORAT: Thank you.
