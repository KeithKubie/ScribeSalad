that matches up with how the simulations

show it should work out and we have some

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489

those simulations we have a project

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:41.630
those simulations we have a project
 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.259

to building a large radio-telescope a

to building a large radio-telescope a
 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.119
to building a large radio-telescope a
completely new kind of radio telescope

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129
completely new kind of radio telescope
 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.540

the project has me quite excited because

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550

historically whenever a new kind of
 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.239
historically whenever a new kind of
telescope has been introduced that looks

00:00:58.239 --> 00:00:58.249
telescope has been introduced that looks
 

00:00:58.249 --> 00:00:59.729
telescope has been introduced that looks
in a different part of the spectrum

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739
in a different part of the spectrum
 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.009
in a different part of the spectrum
we've always discovered things that we

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019
we've always discovered things that we
 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:06.040
we've always discovered things that we
had no idea existed and this is a

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050
had no idea existed and this is a
 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.490
had no idea existed and this is a
completely new kind of instrument and I

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500
completely new kind of instrument and I
 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.890
completely new kind of instrument and I
feel confident that there will be great

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900
feel confident that there will be great
 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.130
feel confident that there will be great
discoveries that will open up new areas

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140
discoveries that will open up new areas
