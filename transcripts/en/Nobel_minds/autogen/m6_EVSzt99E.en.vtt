is the role of science and technology in

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380
is the role of science and technology in
 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.980
is the role of science and technology in
21st century to the mankind and all the

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990
21st century to the mankind and all the
 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.950
21st century to the mankind and all the
life of Anna yes of course so we start

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960
life of Anna yes of course so we start
 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.860
life of Anna yes of course so we start
the 21st century with many problems the

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870
the 21st century with many problems the
 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.019
the 21st century with many problems the
part of energy in the difficulty of

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029
part of energy in the difficulty of
 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.670
part of energy in the difficulty of
finding energy after the end of the oil

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680
finding energy after the end of the oil
 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.320
finding energy after the end of the oil
the point of climate the program of

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330
the point of climate the program of
 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.259
the point of climate the program of
water in many countries and so of course

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269
water in many countries and so of course
 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.930
water in many countries and so of course
we will be able to solve all this

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940
we will be able to solve all this
 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.500
we will be able to solve all this
problem with the help of science exam

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510
problem with the help of science exam
 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.369
problem with the help of science exam
science can to find new source of energy

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379
science can to find new source of energy
 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.900
science can to find new source of energy
from the Sun with cellular cells also to

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910
from the Sun with cellular cells also to
 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.540
from the Sun with cellular cells also to
solve the parameter primate to control

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550
solve the parameter primate to control
 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.610
solve the parameter primate to control
the concentration of carbon dioxide in

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620
the concentration of carbon dioxide in
 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.850
the concentration of carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere and so on so science will

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860
the atmosphere and so on so science will
 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.580
the atmosphere and so on so science will
be important to solve all these new

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590
be important to solve all these new
 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.789
be important to solve all these new
problem of humanity
