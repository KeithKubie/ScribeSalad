Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Boom, boom, boom. What's happening brother? Let's do it, man. What's crack? It's good to be back. Good to be back. Good. It's always amazing. It's like, it's like a little, it's a, it's a bit of an amusement park almost now with stuff to see and the, and the gym equipment and everything. I keep thinking I should just bring my gear over and work out before the show or after the show, but they lose, I don't want to embarrass myself, so I'm going to embarrass you. Say I'm not going to watch or watch your workout. And he would like Jamie's, that kind of guy. Yeah, I've seen him give me side-eye he would give me, but no, it's, yeah, it's all good. Everything's, everything's good. I've been traveling a lot, having to, we just talked before we started about Idaho. Haven't had a chance to get back there, but, uh, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:00:41       All good. All good. So you're around for a television show, is that what you're doing? Um, yeah, this is, this is a, there's, there's several meetings going on here, but we just finished, uh, uh, filming a show, a reality show, um, for, uh, can I say the network they Kinda Hinky on until we get closer to the hair day, which is October. Uh, but it's for the discovery network and it's gonna be, it's gonna be a great show that I, that I'm hosting. Well, you know what, that's what I always said. I always thought free publicity is a good thing. Um, but they're very tight on the marketing protocols and so they want to make sure they've got it all buttoned up. And I get that right. They spend, you know, a lot of money on these things and fucking so freaks. Yeah. And so, anyway, but it's going to be a great, uh, a great show.

Speaker 1:          00:01:24       We spent the past three or four months, um, filming it around the country, a really good production team. And the stories are fantastic. It's basically looking at, I guess I'm talking about it, I'm not supposed to, but w we're looking at, um, uh, military government organizations that are typically in the shadows, right? We're not releasing any sources and methods. We're not disclosing classified secrets, but we're talking about elements and units, operational activity, um, events that, uh, before now I've pretty much been in the shadows and some incredible people. That's one of the best parts about this thing that's been going out there and meet some of these guys that are doing some of this high-speed shit. And it's, it's pretty amazing. And when, when they do release things like long, long after, like I was reading something, uh, I forget what the case was about, but it was something about how the, the files won't be released under the freedom of Information Act until 2080.

Speaker 1:          00:02:20       Well, how do you, yeah, I know. What are they, how do they make that decision? Like that was the thing with the Kennedy assassination, right? And sometimes they roll it over and it's not even then. Right? So sometimes they extend that, um, other times they don't. And so some information comes to light periodically. Um, and so this does look at this, this show we'll be looking at some historic, but a lot of current things that are going on and, and where the money goes, right. What are we spending on money on when it comes to this high speed operations that the special forces and others are involved in? Um, so it'll be, it'll be very good. I was, I was lucky to be able to work with again, you know, some really great people on the production side, but just also going out there and meeting some of these cats.

Speaker 1:          00:02:59       They're just, the, the, the shit that they do is, is, it's even after being around a while, cause I have, um, it just amazes me. Well, it's gotta be constantly accelerating too. Right? There's, they're constantly coming up with new and spectacular things that nobody knows about until they employ them. Right, exactly. And sometimes that shit stays on the shelf. Right. You know, it was like the, the running joke at the agency at the, at the CIA was, you know, we have a fantastic s and t group, a science and technology group and another one's responsible like cue from, from bond, right. They're the ones responsible for developing all the gear, uh, responding to specific operational requirements. How are we going to do this particular thing? Well it's develop a piece of kit that's going to allow us to do it. Um, but the running joke is always that, you know, they'll develop it and they'll show it to you before an operation, but then they'll put it back on the shelf cause they don't want that shit getting out there.

Speaker 1:          00:03:47       Right. And people finding out that they've got it. So they'll give you like a, a 20 year old piece of kit to use instead and you'll be walking around with like a phone the size of a brick. Um, knowing that they've got something high speed on the shelf. Well that's what everybody always thinks. Like when you talk to the average Joe on the street about technology and the government, there was like dudes and stuff they have that they probably don't tell us about how much of that is real. Yeah. Um, it's, it's pretty real. Have you seen some stuff that made you go, Holy Shit, yes. You can do that. Yes. Really? Yeah. And how much can you tell us? Um, well, you know what one thing that they're doing and, and there's, I, this is actually something I wanted to talk about today because it's gonna affect everybody.

Speaker 1:          00:04:27       It's not just something that is going to affect people in the military or else in the intelligence community, but one of the things that they've been working on is imagine you've got gotta, you've got to rock up on it on a target and your butt, your before you do that before you, you get the customers on site and you're gonna, you know, hopefully obtain some high value, uh, targets there at that location. Before you do that, you gotta, you gotta can euphemisms, Oh, I'm sorry. Before, before you can go in there, loteria listen to another dimension. But sometimes you know, you're okay. Actually I was going to say sometimes you want to actually capture them and get their intelligence. We've gotten past that, right? Because the years where we were getting our ass kicked for holding onto people in, in detention facilities, um, you know what that did that, that pretty much convinced everybody that was involved in this to just just whack them.

Speaker 1:          00:05:12       Right? Because then you don't have to deal with the aftermath. You don't have to worry about, oh, you're going to get in trouble for interrogating somebody. Right. Exactly. So, so that actually increasingly [inaudible] of operations, you started painting targets and just blowing the shit out of there rather than trying to grab the target and get their intel. That's a problem because in the pipeline dries up for the Intel. But anyway, so imagine you've got this, you got this site, the first thing you gotta do is determine if your target's there. Right. Then it's not like that. You know, the Tom Clancy movies where you're looking through walls and all this shit. It's it, you know, that that technology night vision devices and, and, and that ability and low light conditions to, uh, to monitor and do identify specific individuals, um, has always been a problem. They've made great strides on it to the point now where in no

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       light conditions, right, with the, with the right stack database, with the right information and that database meaning the right amount of, of information about individuals, right? You just constantly populating this database with new faces or with new photographs of individuals that you're going after, um, with enough of that to sift through. They're getting to the point now with no light conditions that they can, uh, identify positively the targets in that room are the targets in that facility or in that building, whatever it might be. And that's pretty incredible.

Speaker 3:          00:06:29       I'd rather they can identify people by their heart rate [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:06:33       with w well not just their heart. Right. But I mean other, other bio-data right. I mean other than other,

Speaker 3:          00:06:38       but they can literally with video somehow or another, they can zoom in on you with some scanner and recognize that this is a particular individual because of their heart rate. This is, there was an article that was written about it and I know that there's a company, do you know what Hex is? Hecs. It's um, it's a company that's been used, uh, pretty extensively by scuba diving community. Um, and now, uh, by the hunting community as well because it blocks the electrical signal hecs. It blocks the electrical signal that your body gives off. Okay. Yup. That makes sense. And I think they're doing work with the military as well to develop suits that will somehow know another stop someone from being able to recognize your particular heart rate.

Speaker 2:          00:07:26       Right. And it does a lot of work on, on what they call this sort of the universe and their goals. Here.

Speaker 3:          00:07:30       Pentagon is a lady that I can identify people from a distance,

Speaker 2:          00:07:33       other heartbeat. Yeah. It helps. It helps if you have other data points. Right. If you had, but um, this is all part of it to some degree. What, you know, they refer to as a universal soldier, right? They, the, the fighter of tomorrow and [inaudible]. Yeah, but they got shit. That's right. Who doesn't remember [inaudible] although he's all in with grin. He's doing like chip commercials now. I'm sure you haven't seen him at [inaudible]. He knows or whatever. Dude, 70th trill. The splits. Yeah. Well ops, I don't know when that becomes useful though. Really the splits, I mean, I've never actually felt that that was something I need to do, accomplish in any given moment from an operational [inaudible] movies where you have to do this. It's still very important. But so the, the universal soldier thing where you, you, you, your, you know, it's an Exoskeleton, it's a soft suit. It's all the data that you can acquire for that war fighter. How do you create the perfect environment on that individual as he's moving through an environment to, to, you know, be a more efficient, effective, lethal fighter and you know, things like that. Identifying target, whether it's with a laser, whether it's with low light or no light conditions where you can, as you're rocking up on the target, you can do all these things, you know, the ability to, to carry more gear, right? Hump it, another extra, you know, 10 kilometers, whatever

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       it might be. Uh, it's, it's pretty incredible what they're doing and it's, it's a joint. It's not just the military. They're working with, uh, you know, companies like hacks or they're working with the, with the commercial sector, um, and academics too. But anyway, and I disappeared down a rabbit hole. Uh, the, these like the, the idea of like this universal soldier thing. Have you been paying attention to this Elon Musk neurolink thing that he's coming out with, whether they're going to somehow or another insert fibers into your brain and then have a Bluetooth enabled device that you wear that's going to allow you to somehow or another interface with data at a much higher bandwidth? I don't know what the fuck any of those words mean. I just said, but that was good though. That was good. It sounded like you understood it. That's my trick.

Speaker 1:          00:09:42       So yeah, I, you know, that comes up point. Um, if you're talking about, I mean that's, that's going into a different area that's going into civilian applications. And by the way, the military application would be great for that too. Everyone could synchronize data. You could give them navigation in their head. Like if there's some sort of augmented reality, we could literally see the targets in front of you. Like if you had a map, say like the, if the Pentagon really does have this laser beam that could identify specific individuals and you have a map of a building that's in your head and they can identify the very location, absolute perfect location of each individual person in that room. And you could see that as you're running into this building, you're seeing like a three d grid in front of you and you know, I mean, you could shoot them right through a fucking wall, right?

Speaker 1:          00:10:29       And there's, but there's, there, there does become a problem, then that becomes a problem of, of information overload. And when you get into that situation, right, everything starts to close down a little bit. Right? And, and so you've got to start pushing some of that away. And now what you end up doing is you get the offsite, you know, command center a relaying some of that information as needed. But that guy that's about to, to breach that door, you know, he doesn't want a lot of data points anymore. Now having said that, knowing where, you know, knowing where the hostiles are and the other side of that door, that is key information, that's not rocket science but so there, but there's a lot that's going on. It's also the ability to monitor the health of the individual. You know, soldiers are out there, uh, through the, the, the gear that they would then be wearing.

Speaker 1:          00:11:11       Um, it's an, it's an incredible, uh, effort that has been going on and, and so to answer your point, long rambling answer, uh, yeah, I've seen some things that are pretty amazing. You can't talk about it though. No, no. Some of this, some of the shit actually we'll, we'll get into with the new show that's coming up sometime in fall. I don't have a really state, and again, I'm prescribed from talking about, so I won't do that because some I pay attention. Some of the things that you saw you'll be able to talk about. Yes. So how does the government do that? They just decide, well listen, it's not a bad thing if you tell people about this something, I'll give you this. Right? Well, I think this, there's an element of, some of it's not what you would refer to as classified. It's just not readily available public information and it's not out there in the, because people aren't

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       aware of it or searching for it. Um, some of it does. I think you're right. Some of it is, look, the military wants to say at times, look what we're able to do or we're doing this. And oftentimes it's because it's in a sort of a private public cooperation and, and so that encourages other, uh, companies with innovative technologies to step forward and, and get involved in some of this. Um, and I guess that opens up all sorts of other, you know, some people are out there saying, well they shouldn't be working

Speaker 3:          00:12:21       and with the military. Well you know, fuck, well that's a question that I had the, this brings me to a point that I think is kind of important where people always talk about the military budget and how high the military budget is and you know, we need to take some of that money and put it in other places. And you know, maybe some of that military money is not being used to the best for the best good of the human race or maybe maybe some of it. But in order to be able to develop stuff that keeps people safer in order to develop all this stuff that you're talking about that could potentially save the lives of soldiers and even innocent civilians because you're going to be able to target the correct people. Like all this stuff seems pretty critical. Right,

Speaker 2:          00:13:04       right. And it's also, there is a, you know, there's an upside if you want to get more listic about the whole thing to developing advanced technologies, you can be more surgical, right? [inaudible] the drone capability as an example gives you a, a much better understanding of your target. You can avoid the collateral damage, you know, the deaths of civilians on site, um, through the use of proper technology. And that creates that environment. And so it's a good thing. And, and again, I mean, CIA, their s and t group over the years, the shit that they've developed for operational purposes that then made its way into the commercial sector and planet fitted people. What battery technology, anybody walking around with a pacemaker or defibrillator, you know, in part can thank the the agency because what were they doing? They were, they were working, they continue to work on, on battery technology, shrinking those batteries as a power source.

Speaker 2:          00:13:54       What initially operational purposes. So you could, uh, you know, uh, it put a transmitter out some site, you know, and, and, um, you know, so what are you doing? You're eavesdropping on a, on a hostile target or you know, gathering intelligence, but then that, that effort, all that work that was done then that later on benefits the general public drone technology. Same thing, right? I mean the agency was front and center on developing drone capability. Now what are you doing? You're doing that to, to, you know, for environmental concerns? Um, you know, for mining, uh, it's,

Speaker 3:          00:14:27       I'm a little concerned about drone technology. My old house that I used to live at this motherfucker that lived down the street from ace to hover a drone over my house and film. He like f like I know he's like looking at me like, what are you doing to ask me swimming? You fucking Weirdo. Did you ever go over and talk to him? No. Ah, no. Should've sent a drone over his house. Yeah, I was thinking of shooting it down. But it's hard to aim up. No,

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       you can now update the bow and Arrow. I know that'd be a hell of a shot. You have a good boat. Like, see, the way, the way you calculate accuracy with archery is you have a range finder and that range finder has a built in adjustments for angle this angle compensation for up or for down. But I don't know if it has it for straight up in the air. Like, cause you got to think the way you, you're judging how much an arrow is going to drop over the course of the flight. Right, right, right. The same as the bottles too. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. But with a bullet, obviously it's less compensation because it's much faster. But, um, there's a video that's hilarious of this guy, uh, got tired of this block party in Brazil, so he loaded up a drone filled with fireworks and uh, he hovered it over the block party and started launching bottle rockets down on these guys that are, uh, make it too much noise.

Speaker 1:          00:15:49       That's excellent though. I mean, if you think, but that sounds like something one of my boys would do. And then I'm sure there'll be listening to this at some point. So they, um, did they tell you're going to do this? Yes. Scooter. Sluggo and Mugsy but it's when you have a kid named sluggo or Mugsy or scooter guaranteed, they're gonna do, they're gonna do something like that. Yeah. Yeah. [inaudible] when you're naming your kids, I didn't know, it didn't occur to me. It didn't occur to me, although I wanted to get Eugene or something. I wanted Eugene, Eugene, I wanted to give him flattops. Right. Every summer I want to have the same discussion with, with, uh, with my wife who's the world's greatest person. Uh, I wanted to give them a flat tops and she always says, look, uh, with names like scooter slug and Mugsy, you give them a flat top as well, then that's it.

Speaker 1:          00:16:29       You a database. Exactly. They're going somewhere. But, uh, it's, you know, the best way to take down a drone, uh, is, uh, is just blanketed jam it and drop it up well yet it's like a, you know, it's like the old days of jamming a radio signal basically. Right. When you're, you're interrupting, you're blanketing it and you're interrupting the, the, the data communication from the controller to the drone. And, um, like the drone that was taken down in the Iranian drone that we took down, I think you'll see USS boxer was involved in that out there in the, uh, the, the street. That's how they do it. They don't fire a missile at it anymore, you know, it's just, it's much more effective. Something on it that disrupts the signal. Right. Yeah. It's just a, it's essentially again, and not to oversimplify, just jamming, but is that jamming technology available to civilians?

Speaker 1:          00:17:16       Um, to really, really smart civilians? I guess it could. It could be. Yeah. Really smart civilians would probably be able to figure that stuff out. Jamie, you know anybody that's work on that, I'm looking to find some real, Jamie, can you meet? Uh, so, uh, yeah. Scooter to technology scooters just out at a west point. Uh, he wants to go to west point when he's, when he's old enough and so he went out there for a lacrosse program and I'd forgotten. Have you been to west point? No. You got, you got to go at some it's, I know it's a ways away from here. It's not a day trip, but it's this, it's a beautiful campus and forgotten about that. Obviously it's got to cause that where Jody foster wills and sounds of the limbs and west point, it doesn't sound right. I don't think so.

Speaker 1:          00:17:59       The drone kill gun. Wow. That's crazy. Three [inaudible] lightweight compact drone counter-measure drone gun, 3000. Jamie ordered me one of those immediately. Yeah. Amazon please. Yeah. That would have taken, that would have taken care of this guy. Um, yeah, but the problem is it's not as satisfying as a bow and arrow. Yes. That's a good point. That's a good point. Uh, so, uh, one of the things I wanted, I didn't know how it's not as smooth segue, but we were talking a bit about technology technology, um, is particularly with a 2020 election coming up is this idea of deep fakes. Yes. Fantastic stuff. Um, and the technology to create this nowadays to create a deep fake up, which essentially just means you're doctoring a photo or video and making it do what you want it to do to try to convince people of whatever it is.

Speaker 1:          00:18:56       Um, technology is, is, is advancing and it's stunning what can be done. Kyle Dunnigan is Kyle Dunnigan. I should know, I should know hilarious standup comedian, but he shines in doing deep fakes and he's working with this other guy. I think the guy's called Dr Fagan's. Time for the faking. Yeah. Two separate guys. But yeah, one of those guys. But go to go to his, uh, Instagram and see the new one that he did with the Elon Musk. He was doing, I'm really kind of crudely with like face with, you know, um, face swap or face, that's like a little filter that you get from snapchat or something like that or Instagram. But now he's moved from that to doing this really high end stuff. Go to the Elan Musk one. Look at this, play this vacancy into this. Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:19:38       Uh, I just [inaudible] I Tessa labs, which is pretty cool. It's pretty cool. But, but, but we had a little snafu edit. It looks like time is slowing down and we'll eventually start going backwards at an increasing rate. So pretty soon you will become a baby again and be sucked back into your mother's vagina. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:19:58       Okay. Now pause. Now go to another Kyle Donagen video so he can tell what cow really looks like. That's him to the right of that. This is what he really looks like, which is fucking madness. Yeah, the guy's hilarious by the way. He's awesome guy too. And he's got a great Instagram page, but his Instagram page is mostly him, like the gold boom. So the gold one was chip click on that. Cause that's a normal one. This is what he did with the filters without doctor fake Stein. Look at the seals of creepy face. Yeah, yeah, but play that. So

Speaker 4:          00:20:29       Ellen did genesis sore ass a seems friendly Blackson bud. But no, don't get too close to her and she'll bite your fucking head off. Just ask the uh, Porsche Raptor as he has. He has, he has, he asks.

Speaker 1:          00:20:44       And that's really Yoda. Gotcha. Railroad is always smoking. Yeah. Although we gave it up, I, you remember, but in the videos he's always smoking the look. It's, it's bad enough that it's extra hilarious cause it's bad. But the new one that he did with Elon Musk is not bad. It's not bad. But Caitlyn Jenner one go to the Caitlin Jenner one on the far right. That's fucking genius. Click on this one

Speaker 5:          00:21:08       carefully. Kylie. I have shopping. Sherry has Chicago. When you had your shared right here is your go. I buried your old fasion, a Pecha and Metairie by accident and I'm sure, I'm just saying it's back. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:21:25       Okay. But those, those are my favorites. He has the Kardashians, the elite. That's the only way they talk. They just say yum, yum. And then he knows what they're saying. Sort of like Groot in guardians of the galaxy.

Speaker 2:          00:21:40       I don't know. I don't know how I miss these things. I clearly watching the wrong shit on the Internet. Oh, you're a former CIA guy. I should know this. The important thing is I don't have time for college. Okay, well but this, but what you just showed, I mean, people look at that and I go, okay, but you're right. The Ilan Mustang is getting closer to creepy that Bobby, a real guy. But you could have someone like that say, give me $1 million or oh, bull your house up or just come on. Yeah. And imagine if he gave, um, you know, some off the cuff, um, financial data on, on Tesla now talks about it as if, as if he'd just come out of a shareholder call and now he was releasing some information. Let me think about what that means to the, all of a sudden the stock price of, of a company, if that, if that happens.

Speaker 2:          00:22:22       But, um, the quality is, is so far beyond even that now that we can be done by, and we're talking mostly state actors like, like Russia. And so the problem we're facing now is it's not just everybody's kind of kind of aware of, you know, the, the sort of, the tweet averse or whatever, the Twitter and, um, the trolls that exist on there and the bots and all of that. But it's the video, the ability to do the video they released. One, one was done not too long ago with Nancy Pelosi. And it, all it did was slow down her speech just slightly, but just enough to make it sound as if she was slurring her words. Maybe she'd had a couple of drinks and that thing was blasted all over social media and people to this day still think and they still talk about it. Like, you know, she's kind of losing it a little bit and right.

Speaker 2:          00:23:07       And that like, or more by the way, if she did that, yeah, I think she might make a little more sense. Get a little lightened up lady worth $100 million and no one knows why you should have be out there partying. I'm sure it was all, oh, so legit. Yeah. She earned that $100 million. Sure. There's definitely no shenanigans, no shenanigans, no, there's nothing like that happening up on Capitol Hill. Um, but it's, so this, this is a, it's something that people should watch. It's something that people should, you know, read up on a little bit, look at it, because the technology is advancing so quickly that the effort to combat it, the effort would detect it. And there's some companies out there and certainly the, the, the government is, is working to do that. DARPA and some others are working, but the effort to try to identify doctored videos, right, and particularly when you're talking about elections campaigns, um, is, is it's going to be a, an increasing problem that we're not really discussing that much and congress is paying a little bit of attention to it right now.

Speaker 2:          00:24:08       Um, but it's, uh, it's really problematic and there's, there's things that, that you used to be able to look for, right? Lighting and noise and just sort of the movements of the face, uh, what they call micro heartbeats and, and all the little things is the, is the subject in the video blinking for instance, when your doctor at sometimes they'd the blinking wouldn't be there and that was a tell. But the, the people involved in all of this, in creating these deep fakes are working, um, you know, at such a pace that they're getting ahead of that. So, uh, it's, I mean, it's fascinating anyway, they're coming up with ways to try to counter it. But I guess the, the biggest point is, it sounds like a public service announcement is people need to be aware of it and they need to be smart about it.

Speaker 2:          00:24:53       Of course they won't be, everybody goes to the Internet and they, they lose their minds and they believe whatever it is that they read that agrees with their opinion and there is no bothering of checking, you know, uh, whether anything is actually legit anymore or not. But if that would be my one piece of advice going into 2020 starting now, pay attention. Don't believe anything you see until you prove it. And that's part of the problem too, right? If we stop believing anything we see. But if I was a skeptical person, right, if I was a conspiracy minded individual, I'd say, but you're not this guy who used to work for the CIA is telling us not to believe the news. Wait, I see what you're saying. What I'm saying is you are setting us up. Okay, well it's time for me to go look at that.

Speaker 2:          00:25:37       Wouldn't normal skeptical person want to think like why is he danced? I guess? I guess I'm saying I'm saying it wrong cause you're right. I don't mean to say, I don't mean to imply, I guess what I'm saying is trust but verify, right? When, when when you're looking at a video of a candidate or you're looking at anything really on the Internet now just be aware of the capabilities. Maybe that's a better way of putting all of this because you're right, you don't want that part of the problem. And one of the things that Russia does and, and others who are involved in this whole propaganda effort, um, one of the things they do want to do is undermine our confidence obviously in media. So, you know, by me saying don't believe what you see, I'm kind of feeding into that. So you're right, I shouldn't, I shouldn't go that route. Be Aware of what the capabilities are, pay attention. Everybody should just be a little bit smarter about what they're doing. That's all I'm saying. So, and also what we're looking at now, it's so much more powerful than what we had three or four years ago. Three or four years ago, this technology was not available for the consumer, but now it is. Well, there was, I mean, you think about it not to get too deep, but if you think about the, the photography, how long has photography been

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       around? There have been efforts to manipulate photography, right? So the, so altering photographs has been around almost as long as the, the, the medium itself. Um, you go to a photo shop, um, that kind of put it all in the hands of the consumer, you know, um, what you were talking about face swap, uh, the new face app to age people. Yeah. Um, all these things make it easier for whoever's got a smart phone to try to do this. But what you really, and that's a problem as well, but one of the things that you really have to worry about is against what are the state actors like a Russia, I mean, Russia was behind the faces swamp thing. Well, yeah, and that's a good first step, right? There are Russian companies that are, uh, pushing this technology out there. And what are they doing every, you know, every time you do that, it's recording data about you.

Speaker 1:          00:27:31       Well, not only that, you have to give your name and your email, right to get that application and then they have a photo of your face that correlates with your name and your email. So what they've done is they've gathered up more than 150 million emails and faces and they have data on people. Yeah, that is, that's pretty powerful stuff. Like if you think about what Facebook has done, right? What Facebook has made billions and billions of dollars by essentially mining data, right? That's what they're about, right? Google's the same thing. They're mining data. Well, Russia managed to do that with 150 million people in a very, very short amount of time just by making something cute. Oh, let's see what I look like. What am I a hundred men now? What do you think they're doing with that data there? They're slicing and dicing this, trying to understand the American electorate, right?

Speaker 1:          00:28:17       They're going to, they're not going to stop doing what they did and they've been doing this forever. We talked about this before, they'd been doing this since 1940s. Right. Busy trying to keep the US out of world war two before they broke up with the Nazis. It was as it was a serious breakup, a, but when they were still aligned, they were busy paying off journalists and buying trade unions and all the rest of it. So they're not, they're never gonna stop what they do because it's worked for them and it's just kind of in their DNA. But isn't that also what the United States does as well? And there's gotta be some sort of counter-intelligence stuff that we do that is sort of shading. Shoot. Well, I don't know about shade. Justifiably shady. How about that? Gee, I like that. Okay. That's a good term.

Speaker 1:          00:28:58       Yeah, of course there is. And people always do that. [inaudible] you know, when I, when I'm talking about, if I, if I'm giving a talk about, uh, uh, Chinese government, uh, constant theft of intellectual property, um, somebody inevitably will come up afterwards and they will kind of roll their eyes and go, well, we do it. It's not like it's just them. The U S is guilty of it too. What you damn well better hope we are. Right. Because if we backed off and said, you know what, just you know, for the sake of being of righteous individual, we're not gonna do any of this shit. You would have to be with willfully ignorant, naive, or just fucking stupid to think that Russia, China, these other actors out there are gonna stop also. Right. And we're all gonna hold hands and Unicorns going to flying out of our ass.

Speaker 1:          00:29:36       It's not gonna happen. So yeah, I mean I guess the answer to that is always the same, which is yeah, better hope we do it and we've been to hope we do it well. Yeah. But people are nervous about that, right? Like this is my point about the military budget. Like if you just cut the military entirely, well, we're all going to start speaking Chinese because some shit's going to go down. Like you can't just cut the military budget. You just, you can't, I mean, just cut it out. One. No, no military at all. We're going to focus on ourselves. Yeah, we'll got fucking luck with that. That doesn't work. So the question is like how much money should you spend on the military? How much money should you spend on counter-intelligence? How much money should you spend on propaganda? I mean there should be some money spent on propaganda overseas, right?

Speaker 1:          00:30:17       Cause we're, we're trying to manipulate them the way they're trying to manipulate us. The idea though is that where America we're nice where the good guys, we're doing it the right way supposedly. Yeah. Well there is that right? There is that and there's, and you know what, honestly, I'll be honest with you, I'd, I've always, you know, like maybe I'm naive or whatever, but that was always my thought process. When we're out there in the operational world and you think, you know what, okay so doing this, but we're doing it for the right reason. And people laugh at that or whatever. But you know, this is my phone so I'll look at that, see that flag dad long may a wave. That's how I am. I open up my phone to flag waves that may have got a flag behind me. I'm a hundred percent pro America.

Speaker 1:          00:30:56       I got, I opened up my phone, we like to throw it. I got, I got, I got nothing. I got nothing. I got I over the phone too. Is that some sort of like hack free? Yeah. Phone from the 60s. This is actually a windup. A phone. It's a phone. Yeah, I do have a flip. The government can't, oh, there you go. Yeah. And you know what I've got, I've got a collection of phones going all the way back to the cinderblock phone. Remember that one? I bet you guys fantastic Saudi Arabian numbers on them and shit letters. I assumed everybody does, but yeah, that I think do this is your phones that like are like hack proof until you this phones that you can't use? Well, yeah, you certainly know that, you know, from an operational perspective, um, you know, phones are not a good idea.

Speaker 1:          00:31:43       Now the problem is they're ubiquitous and everybody uses them and it, you know, it's made life very easy and it's also even made life a little bit less secure. Obviously. I know a guy that is a, let's just say, done some very unusual journalism and, uh, he still has a phone that you can take the batteries out. Yes. He said there's some places where you go where they will not let you in the room if you have a phone. And so the, the work around is he has an older Samsung phone where you can pop the back off and remove the battery. And that's the only way. Yeah. I mean, that's, um, you know, I, I would still argue there's, there's workarounds on that one, so. Yeah. But, um, Eh, yeah. You know, that's why when you, when you go into a government facility, you know, they go at a skiff, you know, you got to leave your phones outside, you know, the lead box.

Speaker 1:          00:32:33       Right, right. So you don't tell, you don't carry your phones in, you know, unless you're, what was her name that was doing that and walking into, oh, the fucking chick from the apprentice. Yeah, that's Amarosa. That's how hilarious is that by the way. I know her. I did fear factor with her. She was on Fairfax. She told me I was drunk because I was making fun of her. It's like you're drunk. I'm like, no, I'm not. I'm just making fun of you. Yeah. Why wouldn't you? But, but she's, she's an unusual person. The fact that she thought it was okay to do what is a basically treasonous, she was recording these conversations inside the White House and then releasing them to the press. How is she not in jail? How does that work? Yeah. I'm not quite sure. I didn't quite understand how you, how you get around that, right?

Speaker 1:          00:33:17       Because you've got obligations, you signed paperwork, you do all these things and say, I'm going to do the right thing. And if you run foul of that, then you're supposed to suffer the consequences. And occasionally it seems like people aren't, uh, want to know what I think, what, I think she saw some shit and they pulled her aside and they said, listen, I'm real, so I know that you're some sort of a social climb or whatever you're trying to do here. And listen what you did. We'll literally get you locked in jail for the rest of your life. So how bout this? How about you just shut your pie hole and we'll just let this slide. Yeah. I don't know that she's, I don't think anybody would, I mean from a county intelligence perspective and she'd be one of the last people you would trust to actually keep her mouth shut up already period of time.

Speaker 1:          00:33:58       So I'm saying, um, yeah, that's, that's a tough one. But that was, that's it. That's also part of the, the, the issue of, of of, uh, leaks as an example, right? I mean, the issue of choices that you make for your cabinet as well. Right. Well that's true. Yeah. [inaudible] closed circle around you. And that's, you know, again, you can argue, I mean, we, I don't want to get into a political discussion. Trump is an unusual character and you know, they certainly, they, I know. Wow. Wow. That's going to be the, that'll be headlines. How about that fellow that's from England that looks like the divorce judge. Yeah. The boy John Trump. I was just there last week when, uh, when he went over to Buckingham Palace and, and you know, uh, was asked by the queen to form the new government and he accepted. And so, you know, he's, he's an interesting character.

Speaker 1:          00:34:41       He went to eat and he went to Oxford. Um, he's, uh, he's proven himself to be extremely adept at getting, uh, getting elected and most importantly, he looks like Trump's baby brother. Yeah. Yeah. You know what? I suck is fucked up. Like Trump's dad went over to England and bang some waitress and, uh, Bam. Next thing you know, look at the two of them together. Oh, get the fuck outta here. This is mine. This is, I got a buddy of mine sent me this one that's a south park one. It's him with a bike helmet on. That's the best side by side. I've seen so far better. This one's better. Oh yeah. I mean, it literally looks like a young Trump cousin or a brother or something like that, but he's promised, you know, he's promised their, they're out as far as Brexit goes by, you know, Halloween by 31 October. They're done. And they're done with the whole European Union. Yeah. Well that's what, that's what they're saying. And basically now what they're concerned about, of course, is that

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       it's a, it's a hard, uh, hard exit, right. No deal. But he's saying it doesn't matter. If that's the case, then that's what we've got to do. And there's a lot of people, it's, it's, it's interesting, the dynamic is a little bit like here in the u s right. If you're in the northeast corridor and Washington, New York, whatever, Boston, or you're out here on the west coast and you, you, you tend to view the world differently than everything else, the rest of the mass of the country. Right. Which is why people lost their minds and they thought, you know, how could Trump possibly get elected? The UK is a little bit like that, that Brexit vote came around and everybody in London was convinced that we're, you know, it's gonna be 95%. You know, we're not leaving. And so when it came time and they'd voted to leave in 2001, it was 16, uh, the people in London lost their minds.

Speaker 2:          00:36:21       They couldn't believe it, and they still to this day, uh, think everybody else is just an idiot. Right? So there's a similarity say, which is I think why in part Trump, you know, feels sort of that this kinship with Boris Johnson. Um, but yeah, so he's, Boris Johnson has said, but that's it. We're out of here. You know, maybe we can get a deal if we can't, it doesn't matter. We're still leaving. And it'll be interesting to see what happens. But, uh, you know, he's not, uh, he's not unpopular. Um, what's the argument for them leaving? What's the pro Brexit argument? Do you really want to have your country, your sovereign nation, run by a bunch of faceless technocrats living in Brussels who have really zero interest in your sovereign nation. Right? Uh, that's at the heart of it. It's not an economic decision. And people always make that, that problem with Brexit, they always say, well, from an economic perspective, this is not a good thing.

Speaker 2:          00:37:08       Well, the deal at heart isn't an economic concern. It's a, it's the issue of, of serenity. It's the issue of being run again by Brussels W W and, and, and sort of the morass of, of regulations that they've imposed. Um, the inability for the UK to make their own decisions about trade. Um, and so there's a, you know, there, there's a good argument in that regard. Is it going to be a financial problem for them? It's not going to be a disaster. Like some people, you know, throw out there and say, oh my God, this is gonna. You know, the UK is going down the toilet fast. That won't happen. But it'll be, there'll be an upheaval if they, if they, you know, leave without a deal, but they'll adjust. Cause everybody, you know, people want to do deals, right? They want to do trade. It's not like Germany and France, which are the only two partners in the EU that really matter.

Speaker 2:          00:37:55       You know, how dare you, I know I had, I can't believe I just said that. What's the, um, what's the, staying in the European Union argument, um, show everybody not racist at you. Yeah. Global globalism, you know, it's, we're all working together and isn't this a wonderful thing and look at, you know, all the benefits of it free movement and you know, that free movement, you know, didn't really work that well from, from France and Germany's perspective, you know, they don't like to talk about that anymore for women is basically what we enjoy in the United States though, isn't it? I mean, if you look at the United States relative size in comparison to Europe, we're basically commensurate, right? Yeah. In terms of the contiguous United States. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. And we all speak

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       the same language, but I'm talking about, I'm talking about immigration policies. I'm not talking about movement within the EU. No, no, I understand. But I mean, yeah, even in immigration, right? Like the size of these countries in comparison to the size of states, like Texas is basically bigger than a lot of fucking European nations, right? Yeah. Yeah. It's, um, it is, um, that arguments, what are the immigration argument? Much like some of the other arguments that comes down from the UK is perspective on don't tell us what to do. Right. And you know, maybe there's still an element of, look, we, you know, we, we're an empire. They control most of the planet for awhile. You know, we'd like to, you know, have a little bit more say in what we're doing. So there, there's an independent streak. The problem is from [inaudible] perspective is if they do leave and it's not a disaster, then other countries are going to line up, right.

Speaker 1:          00:39:22       And Italy maybe would be the next one. So it'll be interesting to see what happens. But yeah. Boggio as they call them. Um, is an interesting cat, not unlike our, our president in this country. We don't pay attention to other countries. So when we see that we see that guy, like who is that guy? This new guy, where did he come from? Is this real? It's like a new character on a show that you don't watch. Right, right. You know what season that he come in better call Saul season four. Like who the fuck is that guy? The new bad guy. Ah, I didn't watch, uh, haven't been watching. I just uh, I finished rewatching, I do that instead of watching new shows. I ended up re watching shows that I really liked and I've watched before and it's been a while. So I re watched the first season of breaking bad again.

Speaker 1:          00:40:04       God damn good show. Holy Shit. That was so well done. Yeah. And that, just that first season, if that's all people watch and they haven't seen it before, it's so good. But uh, yeah. And then I just, I just binge watched the first season of the sopranos again. That's a great show. That was the first show that really in my mind, it created the first real anti-hero that everybody actually appreciated on television. Everybody loved Tony Soprano. He's a fucking murderer, constantly cheated on his wife, strangled his best friend. He's like, oh, I'd like them. Yeah. He's like, he's an interesting cat. Yeah. Well it was at dynamic with his mother, right? That was, that's what the hook was. And that certainly that first season was just that, that was fascinating to people and still, you know, still is speaking of deep fakes, remember when they tried to bring them on back after she died?

Speaker 1:          00:40:48       No. Liked the Shitty CGI. Yeah. That's what shows you like in 2005 CGI was goddamn terrible. Well, if you think about when Photoshop, Photoshop was out in what the early nineties, I guess, late eighties, early nineties, um, you think about where we've come since then, um, not to, not, again, not to go back into the, sort of, the, this whole thing with deep fakes, but it is when people talk about, um, Russia collusion and they talk about, we kind of lost our way. Right. And you know, everybody's Kinda guilty of it, whether it's Mueller and his investigative team, or whether it's congress or whether it's just the general public. We all kind of lost our way over the past couple of years imagining somehow that the big story here was, uh, Trump's collusion, right? Well, that was a political

Speaker 2:          00:41:33       dodge, right? That was a shell game that was being played on us. It was, the big story is what did Russia specifically do? Right? What exactly did they do? How did they do it? How successful were they? Show us some case studies of, of specific examples. That's what an investigative team should have been doing for two years. And then deliver that information and keep throwing it out at the public and keep talking to the public about it. A guarantee of the, the GRU and, and, and others, uh, the FSU at the, in, in the Intel services in the, in Russia, they're happy that we didn't do that, right. Because again, they've been in advancing, they've been improving their, their capabilities. They're gonna do it again. So I guess that's why I keep beating on this as that. I don't think we, we really focused our attention to where we needed to because we all get lost in this political bullshit.

Speaker 2:          00:42:22       And while I feel, I feel like this is the most easily manipulated we've ever been as a, as a culture, like I think it's so easy to spin these narratives and to get people upset about anything. Right. And there I th I feel like a lot of these are test cases, like they're trying to see like what happens when we spin up this story? How, how outrage do they get at that story? We'll look at and look at this, look at the issue of racism. You know, look at, look at, I mean, th that thing gets thrown out there now to the point where it's, it's, you know, yeah, I hate to say it, but it's, it's almost losing its meaning in a sense. Right? They just keep hammering away anybody they disagree with. And I'm talking about the, the, the hard left. Progressive. You're a racist, right?

Speaker 2:          00:43:04       It's not possible that you could possibly disagree on policy. I like that. Whatever. That's a squad, you know, AOC and her competitors. I don't give a shit about, you know, where they're from. I care about the fact that their policies from my perspective, other people I'm sure love 'em, you know, a screwed up and screwed up about their policies. Well, um, I'm not a democratic socialist, right? So, um, I, I have a problem with everything from, you look at the, the green new deal, right? And this idea that we're gonna roll this out and fuck the economic impact we know or I know about the economic impact. I think what they're doing is they're just, they're playing to the, they're a base and they're doing it successfully and people hear about it and everybody wants to be righteous. Everybody wants to think, sure, if I care about the environment, let's get rid of emissions.

Speaker 2:          00:43:55       That'll be a great idea. And whether it's that or open borders and the idea that somehow we're, you know, do I think we're running concentration camps down south? No, I don't think that that gets fucked up that we would, that's the terminology that we would have, right. For detainments, for detainment centers. And you know what, you want to, you want to make it better, we'll great. Let's, let's actually do what your job is. Let's make some changes to the, to the, to the, uh, immigration rules and to, to asylum laws. Let's put some more money down there, um, and make conditions a little bit better. There's things that we could, in terms of concrete steps, but we don't, we don't seem to want to do that. We seem to want to just throw shit around at each other. And, and I, and, but the open border thing is, is, is, uh, is, is worrisome.

Speaker 3:          00:44:45       There's a guy named John Norris who was just on, um, uh, my friend Steve Grinnell's podcast. It's called the mediator podcast. And he's a, a a warden. He's a game warden. And one of the things that they had to deal with somewhere along the line was they had to become enforcers for illegal drug, uh, drug marijuana growing, um, these establishments in public lands in national parks. So these guys that were supposed to be just catching people with too many trout on the stringer are now being forced to stop illegal grow ops. And it's all cartel members. And what he's saying is that 80 to 90% of all of the marijuana that gets sold illegally in this country, in the Midwest, and all the different places where it's illegal is coming out of these grow ups. And a lot of it is tainted with dangerous pesticides because these guys are trying to, they're actually using poisons to keep animals from eating the marijuana. But so these kids that are, or whoever the fuck is buying it, they're buying this pot from these illegal places. No one's testing this stuff. You don't know what the fuck you're getting. And you very well could be smoking pot that's poisoning you.

Speaker 2:          00:45:51       Yeah. This, uh, a guy that I know, really good guy, so he's a huge land owner, uh, here in California, uh, to the point where you can spend all day on an ATV and, and still not, you know, get to the end of one of his plots of land. And I'd be call it a plot of land. And anyway, he's had those, uh, incidents, right. He's had where they, it's such a massive piece of property that, uh, ate a small element from a cartel will set up a gross spot there and you know, they'll camouflage it. It's very well done. Uh, they, you bring in the piping for the water cause it w pot uses a huge amount of water. I was talking about one that they brought in, they had a pipe that went for three miles. Yeah. These kids carried it on their back. Yeah. That's what they, that's what these guys do. And then, and then eventually, you know, you got to go in there and busted up, but it's people that stumble across it that, you know, it, they're just out there doing their regular ranching job and it's, it's, it is fascinating. I look, I, um, I feel like we should take those guys,

Speaker 3:          00:46:49       reprogram them. You get a guy who's willing to carry a hundred pounds of piping on his back and walk eight miles into the backwoods. That's a fucking industrious individual. You got to, you got to lure them away from the cartel with a better deal. Yeah. If that guy worked for a competing corporation, he'd be like, look, I like the way you do business.

Speaker 2:          00:47:07       Right. Give them a job on the ranch. You know, give him a check on this guy and he was working for Verizon. They'd be like, Hey, come on over here, man. Put in the time these guys carry on three miles of hose on his back. That's work. That's what we call [inaudible]. Yeah. So you said you use your power for good, not evil. That's what I tell my boys. It's hard though because evil's fun. I think it's a way within the short term it could be more lucrative.

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       Yeah. From their perspective, there is that. And they have a record and probably murderer reasons. All right, so maybe we're not talking about somebody you're going to hire as a landscape or they're your home, but uh, but your point is open board is not a good idea and borders not a good idea. It's a lot of bad people that are getting in already. And it's not, it's not a stretch. This is not if anybody who imagined this to be a stretcher or it's going to take offense at this. Every nation maintains borders. Every nation maintain some element of, of immigration controls and, and borders, uh, protection. Um, the idea that we shouldn't have, that we should somehow feel exceptionally bad about it is I don't quite understand that mentality. Uh, we should feel bad when we see someone who's just a poor mother who's trying to come over to America to get a better job cause she's stuck in Guatemala and it sucks over there and there's no opportunity whatsoever for her to excel, right?

Speaker 1:          00:48:22       That's a different animal than someone who is a, a member of a, some fucking terrible cartel gang that comes over. The question is how do we differentiate and how do we make it so that that woman who's a mom can come over here, right? How do we make it so it's legal? That's the real question. And that's when I wish that, but that's not what they're addressing, right? Well, how many decades now have we, you know, heard about immigration controls and immigration process and regulations and policy and then nothing ever gets done. And so maybe, and again, I think one of the things that's interesting about Trump, um, is as, as strange as as it is the environment. I mean maybe the fact that he is disruptive and sometimes it doesn't seem to give a shit. Maybe that's a good thing because it gets us talking and gets us talking in areas that we haven't before and in ways that we haven't before.

Speaker 1:          00:49:11       So maybe that results in something, maybe like the Chinese, Eh, the public's just going to wait for him to go and then we'll get back to business as usual. That may happen in business as usual. The concern is like if it, how do you differentiate between someone who's coming in illegally because they want a better life versus someone who's coming in illegally because they're literally going to commit murder and sell fentanyl and deal, you know, incredible harm to whatever community they wind up in. And they were a member of ms 13 and they're going to hear there's both things that are going on at the same time and you're a heartless person if you don't want that lady with a child from Guatemala to come over here and do better and she's probably gonna work as hard, if not harder than any good old fashioned red blooded American that's over here trying to make their way through this world and why should we be able to have this opportunity when they can?

Speaker 1:          00:49:59       Yeah. One of the beautiful things about America, right, is that like if you're a poor person and you live in Baltimore or you can get your shit together and get out and you can move to maybe silicon valley or you can move somewhere where there's more prosperity, there's more opportunity and you can get some other poor people in Baltimore. I heard there are, okay, I heard there's, I'm going to pay attention. Some sort of a, there's a word, what does the word he used? Infestation. Infestation of rat infestation. You can't use infestation when you're talking about certain neighborhoods. People get mad, even though he said infested

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       with crime and rats, you still, you're racist.

Speaker 2:          00:50:30       It doesn't matter. The, the, the, the key here is, and it's a democratic talking point, right? I mean this is the, this is a strategy and that's fine. Both parties used different strategies, you know, but the, the Dems have obviously decided in this period of time because it's so intense. There was clearly discussions within wherever the DNC or elsewhere that this is our policy. We are going to push this and we just, you just keep hammering that word, racist, racist, racist, no matter what. And it's gonna stick. And it does because you just, you, you get hit by that hammer and you kinda, you're staring into the light, you don't know how to respond. Right? So, and you think, oh my God, I'm not a racist. But then, you know, you're like, senator, you're still beating your wife. And so it's, it's one of those things you can't, you can't answer.

Speaker 2:          00:51:13       Um, but I think it's bullshit because it's like calling everybody a Nazi. It's, you know, it loses its, its importance and its meaning. And, and you know, um, anyway, it's, it's a strange, strange time, but I, I think you can do both. You can, you can take care of that, that woman with the kid or kids and, and you can also, um, you know, look at the issue of border security, right? And enhance your ability to understand who's coming across the border. It costs money and it, and it requires effort, but you can do, you can do both. I don't think you can do

Speaker 3:          00:51:47       both, but the, I think the real big picture, the real big picture, like if you had to look at the solution objectively, the real problem is Mexico has like real economic situations that we don't have here in America. They're it, they're far worse off than a lot of the areas. And as is Guatemala, as is the neighbor, El Salvador, neighboring countries are economically devastated until they are not until they come up and until they experience prosperity. You're always going to have people that are committing crime because they're wanting to try to get by. And you're always going to have people that didn't want to gonna want to try to get to America because it's a place where there's more opportunity. That's the real issue. The real issue is that it's so much better over.

Speaker 2:          00:52:26       Right. And that's, and that makes sense. And you get the same thing with immigration and movement of, of, uh, of people over in Europe coming up from, from wherever, which is the mascot, which is the Brexit argument in part. I mean, it's not just based on immigration, but it's more control of your own nation's, uh, security and destiny, et cetera. But I think that that's, you could argue that national security, um, from a US perspective, uh, would warrant, um, improving your ability to impact nations like Wa Tamala, El Salvador, uh, wherever, uh, and working with Mexico to not just improve sort of the security, the liaison that goes on and improving that. But you're right, I mean, working conditions, uh, criminal, you know, uh, or crime and, and instability. Um, that's in our national security panel. People get, you know, they get very upset. I said, why should we give countries money?

Speaker 2:          00:53:15       Right? Well in part, you're right. I mean, sometimes you give them money and it just goes down some shit hole and it doesn't, you know, and I don't mean to tell, I'm not talking about the country, I'm just talking literally it goes into a hole and it never goes back. It's in corruption and they, it, and at the highest levels of government. Yeah. So there's no, there's no controls over how that money is spent. This note, there's no metrics to say whether it's spent wisely at the end of the day. So you can [inaudible] but I would argue that, yeah, I agree. I mean, it's in our national security interest when we're talking about, um, uh, border security immigration to view that as sort of the top line issue. Why are they, why are they on the move? Right. Well, like you said, they're on the move because they want a better life because where they're at and good.

Speaker 2:          00:53:56       Yes. How do you work with them? And that's, you know, that's, I think people sometimes look at that and think, well, that's pushing a rock up a hill. It's never going to happen. And so maybe they just stop. Right. But, um, we've ignored Latin America, Central America, South America for decades. Right. Which is how we ended up in part with, with Chavez and Maduro have to follow. And, and some of the Horse Shit that went on down there, uh, because we, we ignored it. We didn't give it to resources. We didn't give it the attention. We didn't treat it seriously as a national security concern. We were all focused on wherever, improving relations in Southeast Asia or elsewhere. So, yeah, we need to refocus. And I think ultimately, do we see it immediately? No, but I think you're so anyway, it's, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:54:38       I think for people that are really like a foreign policy, it is. Yeah. With at least one dude who doesn't know Jack Shit about foreign policy. That would be me. That'd be a good show though. But I, yeah, maybe, but I, I really think in the interest of national security, legalizing marijuana federally would stop the profitability of these gang members because you'd be able to have legal marijuana, you wouldn't have to be able to, you wouldn't need to buy it in these other places. You'd be able to grow it yourself and the price would drop through the fucking floor and it would be not profitable for these guys to haul three miles of pipe on their back and into the back country and use someone else's land to make these grow ops. And one of the reasons why they're doing this, particularly in California, I found out, is that when marijuana became legal in California, these illegal grow ops became a misdemeanor rather than a felony. So they, they do them over here instead of doing it in Ohio or somewhere else where it's illegal. They do. And also, you know, you could basically grow year round here. I was going to say from a logistical point of view, if they'd just made it legal federally, this cut the shit. We're all grownups. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:55:40       Yeah. And there's a tremendous number of issues related to the fact that, you know, the state and the federal laws don't match up. Right. And from a law enforcement perspective, it's a nightmare in a sense. Yeah. So nightmare. Yeah, I agree. You know what, I, I know what will happen is, I don't imagine that the, it makes the, uh, cartel activity any different that sucking sound that that is the revenues from, uh, from weed leaving their, their accounts

Speaker 3:          00:56:02       [inaudible] will be replaced by something else. Who for sure. Whether it's get into the weed business or admit. Yeah. Well, yeah, I mean, although these pharmaceutical companies that are fighting against it as well as these prison guard unions, which is really crazy, that's the darkest one to me. It's like the pharmaceutical companies, look, I get it. They're just creeps that are looking at their bottom line that every business wants to constantly have new growth

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       every year. They want to constantly be making more money. I get it. It's like this universal eternal growth model that they operate under, but the prison guard unions, when you find out that they lobby against the legalization of marijuana is so insane. What to settle. I didn't know. They just want more people in jail so that they have jobs. That's the idea behind it. It's, it's the most un-american thing possible. You want more people in jail so that you could have a job looking over those people. You basically, it's, it's sickening. Yeah. That's a, that's a new one to me. I had, I had no idea. The, the guard unions. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [inaudible] prisons in a nutshell are called fucking crabs. Yeah. Private prisons. Is, is something that, you know, and there have been, I mean, again, I'm, I'm with this current administration, you know, there's, there's been some prison reform issues that have been making their way through.

Speaker 1:          00:57:11       Right. They've been actually focused on it to some degree. Maybe thanks to Kim Kardashian. She said she's just looking at fucking champion. She's a champion of, of people that are wrongly incarcerated. She really is. I want to show you something. I'm like, shout out to Kim K. I'm like one of the, and I'm like, you crazy. A crazy grandpa that clips newspaper articles out. Um, but in preparation for the show, I know most people think I did no preparation whatsoever. I know those guys. I still do to the newspaper. I do as well. Look, you look at this, college has offered degree in courses in the pot business. Oh, good move. Yeah. Yeah. So this is pop to now. Did you know that podcast is a teaching podcast? Have two people that have gone back to school for that, for product, not enough for pot. Pot. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:57:55       It's crazy. University of Maryland and Cornell, that's the two that this article talks about. Uh, well the biggest sponsorship that the UFC has ever gotten ever is this Aurora company in Canada that grows weed, CBD and marijuana. They have football fields fill with weed and you know, the highest possible standards, the best quality, no pesticides, herbicides, no bullshit. Yeah, super pure. And the CBD, which is fantastic for everybody's health. And I just, I'm back when I first started working for the UFC, they were people that worked for the organization, organizations that didn't like it, that I smoked pot. They were like, why is he smoking? What's he doing? It's going to sound pod company. Well, I mean, that's it. I will tell you this as a apropos of nothing. I got, I've gotten calls, a couple of calls from people in the industry who was saying, and the only reason they're calling me is they're saying, can you hook hook me up with Joe is like, we hang out together all the time.

Speaker 1:          00:58:49       Of course. Right. Because we're always, we're always hanging out in the pool together. Uh, Joe and I, but so I said, no, look, dude, that's not my, that's not my job. They want where they want from me. Um, you know what? I think they just want to pitch you on business and bring some spokes in here. Fucking case. That joint. That's the one I do know that people in the potty business. People in the pot business. Yeah. Yeah. Amen. See, I got the SCIA calls. Great words. Yes. Spooks. We gotta be careful using that word though cause people think you're racist. That was a racist term in the 70s. Well we did a black folks. I worked on a show for in the UK, uh, an espionage drama show that ran, ran for eight or nine seasons and it was called in the UK. It was called spooks.

Speaker 1:          00:59:27       It was about, uh, their, uh, Intel operation and it ran for a long time, but then they sold, they brought it over here to the states and I think it was on an awesome channel. And um, but they had to change the name. They changed to [inaudible], which is the name for the domestic security service because they were worried about the term exactly. Spooks. It's always been around. I mean it's, it's always been around the ideas that the sneaky people that are doing creepy shit. There was no, there is no creepy shit being done. You see what I mean? I'm here to tell you right now, and you can write this down. I'm going to write it down, right. There is no, no creepy shit going on. What's going on with a, a ram caught a bunch of people that they are claiming our CIA performance and they may execute them. Yeah, yeah. They've done this before. They've made this

Speaker 2:          01:00:15       before. Um, and look, Iran is a, hey the, a couple of parts of this, um, that's one of the heaviest lifts in the business has been intel collection on Iran over the years. I'm not talking about just recently, but over the years it's been, it's been very difficult. Um, they are extremely buttoned up over there and they have, uh, an incredible level of control over their population, uh, and that, which is, you know, at some point you would think, well, maybe the population is going to object to this, but you know, it hasn't happened yet. Um, so part of it is they came out with this, uh, I think 17 individuals that they claim were cooperating with the CIA in some fashion or another, and they, you know, they claimed that they were fairly high level individuals. Um, I have a, uh, I don't believe anything that comes out of their mouths.

Speaker 2:          01:01:03       I don't believe that at all. I think they've, they've got a long, long track record of, of lying about a variety of things. And so, you know, why would they come out with this? Um, you know, perhaps they're cracking down and it, it doesn't hurt to come out. And if you're going after some of these individuals anyway, why not put them, put the paintbrush on them that they're working for the CIA and that will appease some of the population there. Um, so, I dunno, I'm, again, I'm not buying it. Um, it has been a difficult intel task and collecting intelligence on, on their efforts with, uh, with their ballistic missiles, their nuke program as well, uh, has always been as always been problematic. But again, they've done this before where they've talked about how we've wrapped up a CIA spying network and it's, it's kind of horse shit.

Speaker 2:          01:01:48       It has their propaganda. I though, well, yeah, I mean, you know, uh, yeah, I that, that would be my take on it. I don't know what I mean, I'm not, I'm not internal. I'm not inside. And so, you know, is it possible? Sure. We've had, uh, we've had networks wrapped up before by other countries, Cuba, the Cuban Intel service years ago. Right. Which was completely built by the Russians, by the way, by the old KGB. They owned and operated the Cuban Intel service for a long time. Still do. Um, they at one point wrapped up pretty much everybody we had on. Right.

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       Um, and, and elsewhere people did. We have over there, um, I have three. Uh, no, we, we had, uh, you know, I don't, I don't remember the numbers, but it was, it was a few. Yeah, let's just say it was, it was, it was not good. And they, they, they had done a very good, it was from a, from a counterintelligence perspective, it was a pretty impressive effort. So it's happened, uh, Russia's, you know, uh, done the same when we've usually, when with Russia, usually when we've got a trade or a mole, you know, somebody like Robert Hanson, um, uh, Jim Nicholson and Lee Howard, the Americans. Oh yeah. From what I understand, it's a good show. And it was a show based on the idea that at one point in time there was a Russian family that had come over here and infiltrated and became American citizens and seem like, you know, Joe and Mary next door.

Speaker 1:          01:03:05       Right. But really they were Russian spies. You don't had an aunt and uncle named Joan. Mary. It's weird that you would say that. I literally had an uncle named Joe and Mary Gunselman tell, telling you, buddy, I'm trying to look at it and it's time to go. Um, yeah, I, uh, there was, you know, there was a story, the reason that the Americans was, was created was written as do a lot of things do based on some smart writer who sees an opportunity because he reads a newspaper, um, years back, uh, 2011, I think it was, we had a, uh, a sleeper herself that we wrapped up in Jersey. I remember there was there just takes place. Right. And there was that one that the hot one remember? Um, oh, that's right. Yeah, the hot, broad, the hot bang and everybody got operation. And so bring them over and then you look at anything they had hat.

Speaker 1:          01:03:50       Well, I mean we could, I think she's a, I forgetting what her name was. A fat Danna soccer on your lawn and she walks over store. Yeah. Got High heels on. Yeah. She looks literally nothing. But that's all. Not so much. There's something about her took a, I know that there's some better knows. Do you integration ever knows. Yeah, no, she's hot. You don't think that lady looks hot? Not there. No. That's not a good picture. So you can picture mugshot one, any makeup now. That's true. That's all her up. Yeah. Put a little tighter up p and g blue eye line around her. She'd be a chick catches you with a couple of Jack Daniels and you've got trouble. Okay. She walks across when you're mowing the lawn. So she and a bunch of other people lived in Jersey, in the suburbs. And their whole reason for being with just a spot people, right?

Speaker 1:          01:04:38       It was, it wasn't, they were not, you know, these were not the heads of the, of the organization. Right. So their job is spot. People live there, be social meet people that might be of interest. Maybe it turns out that somebody in the PTA where your kids go to school, maybe somebody who's working for Raytheon or they're working for some, you know, interesting company. That's what they do. So that's their job. Their job was basically to spot. And then you've got other people in that chain of, of events, uh, who are a little bit higher up the food chain who then assess, right. And we'll look at that person and go, yeah, there's maybe there's something, there is person works for whatever company and you know, that'd be it. It could be, it doesn't matter what the company is, by the way. It could be. Qualcomm could be, you know, think of one, cause the application

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       could be, Corning could be any. And there's all sorts of companies out there that, that have applications that may be of interest from an Intel perspective for a hostile state. So then, you know, they'd do a little assessment and maybe they come away and go, yeah, yeah, that person's interesting. Jobless developed a little relationship there. Now, maybe one of those individuals will work on that relationship and maybe somebody else will come in, you know, within this, uh, there's this group, um, and they'll develop a relationship and then, you know, maybe they'll task the person. So maybe say the guy works at a tech company and you know, you're going to think, okay, I want to see if this person has any weaknesses. You know, how can I leverage anything here? And so what you'll say is a, you know, a how I kid, you know, I was doing this school paper and it's on, you know, something and Ah, okay, I can't, you know, I, they, they just not getting it or they're not doing the research or whatever.

Speaker 2:          01:06:08       Hey, do you have anything? You know, and you're not asking for anything classified, you're just saying, look, you, you work in a tech company, you know, don't you have something that would be of interest? You know, my kids gotta write the stupid paper and, and you're not looking for anything of, of Intel value. You're looking to see whether they'll accommodate you, right. Will they actually come back and go, yeah, well you know what, we got this and it's Kinda interesting and it's just, you know, research paper that's, you know, been out in the press for a long time. But yeah, it's interesting. Hey, you know, hands it over and well now you, maybe you got something right now you've got something that you can see that they're responded to a little task and then you'd, so you set the hook a little bit and then you just keep on working on that.

Speaker 2:          01:06:42       So in the meantime, they're calling back to the KGB and saying, we have guys who work at Raytheon, right, knows information just, and they say it just like that, with that very accent. They keep jobs and everything. So they work, they go to work, go to work. Maybe they don't, maybe their spouse, you know, I'm a stay at home spouse, but what do they do? They hang out with other state owned spouses and create friendships because of kids. And the next thing you know, you all haven't dinners with each other and you know, you, if you like that rush and broad, she's banging everybody, right? No, you wouldn't do that. That would be a very disruptive thing to do in that community. Right. And so the premise of the Americans and seem to show, but I watched on banks, people I watched, I watched about half an hour of the first episode and then I'd get angry. No, I just sit there and I go, I'm a very hard person to watch shows like that with. And so, so my wife was like, I just, I know you can't, you can't sit here cause it's like Intel and I'm going like [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          01:07:34       But it was, I, you know, for to understand it was a good show with a show where people play pool. No people really play pool. I'm like fuck yeah. Yeah I was, I was just in the UK and boy, I'll tell you what, I turned on the TV and there's a snooker match on. Yeah, I'm in there sneaker, I'm in there, right. I'll just sit and sit and watch snooker tunes in there. Oh my God. But it's also, it's one of those things where either you can sit and watch it or you like golf or you can't. And I just haven't, for some reason I've got some defect that allows me to sit and watch a billiard match. Have you ever played? It's tough. It's hard. Yeah. Yeah. I, I, we have a pool table at home. The boys have become pretty damn good at, uh, which is a skill of life skill. Uh, but yeah. Billiards. Is

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       it, is it [inaudible] is a different new crews way harder. Yeah. It's way harder. They, they excel in American pool. I don't think any American player has ever gone over there and excelled and sneaker. I don't, I don't believe so. Yeah. Yeah. That'd be something for you guys have tried, but I don't think anybody's succeeded. But there's been a ton of guys from England that have come over here and they do very well on the American pool tour. But you know what we do better on is, is bowling. We do, we kicked the shit out of them when it comes to bowling. Yeah, but that's an American thing. Well, yeah. There you go. Did they bowl, come over here and bowl? I don't think so. I don't know. I don't think so. I don't think I'm advanced, but it's been that migration this way. Equally stupid sport.

Speaker 1:          01:08:57       Yeah. And they get really mad when I say I've got all these texts. You Fuck No, I'm not rolling a ball at these things and you have to pick them back up again. Have you ever bowled sober? I don't think I've ever bowled. So, yeah, both my kids always sober. My kids love bowling and they put up the little bumper thing so it doesn't go in the gutter. So you cheating, so you can just basically whip that fucking thing down there a hundred miles an hour. That's what I do. My thrill is to hear the [inaudible] ball. Yeah. If it's up for that, what's up for me? I'm going to sit up. I give them an edge. No, you know, don't even let them, would you let your kids on the floor, do you let your kids win and things? All the time. Yeah, all the time. But I did get a hamstring injury because I didn't let my kid beat me in a race.

Speaker 1:          01:09:41       I will. She's 11. Okay. I was rough. I was running. I knew something was going on. I'm like, who cares? Push through. She's not winning my fucking hamstrings hurt my middle boy. A sluggo plays basketball. That's all he wants to do day and night. Uh, and he's, he's a bit like a, the sorta like the rain man of basketball too. So in terms of facts, figures, characters, and you know, he can go back to Jerry West and, and, and he'll tell you about bill Russell's career and I think, but he loves basketball and he want to play professionally. Yes, he does. Yeah. So I'll tell you, uh, you know, it doesn't look like it, but in a, in a deep fake video, I look about six foot 10, but what are you like six, six, one that's quite six one. Yeah. Get that kid on growth hormones.

Speaker 1:          01:10:19       Yeah. Well he already left. Yes. Stretch them out and put it in his burgers, hanging up by his ankles. But he, that's all he does. He plays and he just constantly, and he just, all he wants to do is play. And so he's got to the point where, you know, for a long time I would just, we'd go out, we got to court at home and I, I'd, I'd play and, and uh, I kinda let him, you know, as I say, and then it gets to the point where I can't really beat him. I've got hide on him. Right. But his handles are extremely good now. And so, and I'm not the fastest kid on the block anymore. And so it's gotten to the point now where he's legitimately beat me a handful of times and it's very embarrassing because he doesn't really have an edit button, so he, he just rubs that shit out.

Speaker 1:          01:11:00       Right. And it's like, it's like a, it's like the lion king when scar wants to take over. Right. And he's just like, oh, that was pretty good, wasn't it? The lion king reference. It's a good reference, eh. So anyway, yeah, to let them do that though. It's an exercise for you and patients. So when he's talking shit, that's how I look at it. And my kids talk shit. If they beat me, I just go, okay, go ahead and talk to them. Shit. And that's like, you can't, can't let it be personal. No, no. You had to treat it like almost like an Internet heckler. Well, kids are allowed to hit me full blast. So my, my kids take martial arts and I let them, well not the oldest one, the oldest one's 22. She'll fuck me up. Yeah. But the, uh, the young ones, I let them tee off on me.

Speaker 1:          01:11:37       They, they, they're allowed to full blast leg kicked me. They can hurt me, they'll hurt you. But I want them to be able to feel what it feels like to actually hit a person. Cause when you're sparring in martial arts class, you're not allowed to like hit people full blast. You just kinda touch them, you know? And so I let them just fucking slam shins into my thighs and I teach them how to turn it over and dig the, really dig that bone into the sauce bar. That's good. That's, that's actually really good fucking hurt sometimes though. But uh, it's good when we had the same problem with my, with my boys, because they have, they're fairly competitive in there. They're aggressive and, you know, I keep telling them, I said, look, getting punched in the face isn't good and you know, until you actually do well, you know, they've gotten into some, into some, uh, I was going to say 50 cups.

Speaker 1:          01:12:23       Uh, I don't know if you could say that. [inaudible] okay. You're allowed to say fisticuffs I guess 50 coaches are dying. We're continuing to talk over there and he's, uh, has a hard time with water, but it's hard to teach your kids, you know, uh, what that's like. Right. And you know, at some point, you know, maybe they, they, uh, they go through that. They're the youngest one, uh, broke his nose, a courtesy of the older, the oldest one. So mugs, he got his nose broke in a, in a contest with, uh, with the older one, the oldest one scooter and uh, and he found out that's no fun. The thing is though, that kid's going to be the tough one. Yeah. The kid that it's always the youngest ones like you see in the UFC when there's older brothers and younger brothers, the older brothers genuine generally pick on the younger brothers and the younger brothers, once they reach adulthood, almost always can fuck up the older brothers.

Speaker 1:          01:13:12       Yeah. It's really weird. Yeah. Yeah. I was, I took a lot of beatings when I was younger cause I'm the youngest of four boys and so, um, yeah, but it's, yeah, it's good. It's good stuff. And Oh my God, it's, there's this, it's constant and attainment. All right. I mean, you know what it's like, you know, with kids there's always something, and I'm sure right now people are going, oh my God, he's gonna start talking about his kids again at length and they, I'm not going to do that cause the kids names are so cartoonish. Yeah, I know. Well that's part of the reason why they get mad. Yeah. As they are. But, uh, anyways, so, uh, we talked about oceans. Yeah. Okay. Like I like, I'm like Uncle Joe here. I've, I've cut out some, some shit to talk about deep fakes. We talked about that. Okay. Okay. Uh, I wrote down some notes to my God. I was prepared for it. I've never been prepared for your show before. And, you know, why did you decide to get prepared this time? You know, why? Because, because you've got, you've got some really, uh, great, uh, uh, guests, uh, well, no, not really, but viewers and listeners, I mean, I was to think the people that

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       follow this show, um, I find to be a really fascinating, I get a lot of of, uh, feedback and I feel like, you know, I, yeah, I should pay attention than I should. I should prepare a little bit because there's a lot of interest, right. And some of these things that we talk about and you know, so while sometimes I go out and I wing it, you know, and to be fair on new segments, I just make shit up now. I don't, I don't do that. Uh, I know you want to talk

Speaker 3:          01:14:42       about Huawei. Well, I'll Huawei, which I think is a really fascinating subject to me. Um, and a lot of people that are tech inclined because they are at the tip of the spear when it comes to technological innovation in the cell phone space. And I know that they're doing that with, in, in regards to modems and a bunch of other things as well, but it appears at least, and a lot of companies are exclusively using their 5g modems as 5g rolls out. Oh yeah. Yeah. But it appears there they are involved in some serious shenanigans and they have deep roots with the Chinese government.

Speaker 2:          01:15:12       They do, they claim they don't, they claim, look, we're independent. We would never do whatever the Chinese authorities say. Think about that sentence. Think about a company with a global reach of Huawei of that importance to the Chinese state and think about them saying, trying to say with a straight face, we wouldn't, we wouldn't do, you know, things that the Chinese government might ask us to do it alone to show real Chinese company. And you said that you meant it, they would shut. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah. Like you won't, yeah. You would not be in business for that long or there would be a change in the senior management of the business. Um, so, and Huawei's been caught out, they've been caught out in Europe, uh, to the degree where at a certain point you think Germany and others that are deeply involved with Huawei now in terms of the 5g infrastructure where they've just made this decision, look, it's financially better for us to work with wowway and we can set aside the security risks. They literally made that decision that it's

Speaker 3:          01:16:12       an article about that very recently, that they've just decided to have some sort of a risk, uh, to reward conversation. And the, the, the risk is worth

Speaker 2:          01:16:22       a reward. Right. Right. And so, you know, that's, that's their calculation from a US perspective because we are, you know, look, there's, there's two essentially two superpowers now, right? I mean, China's, you know, um, advancing and, and, uh, we're not the lone superpower on the stage anymore. And so we are the number one target. Um, and you know, our calculation has to be different. So we've been going at it and I know everybody, I think it's been, it's been pretty well covered. It didn't used to be covered very well, but it's been pretty well covered over the past couple of months. And now what's happening is we've been in these trade negotiations with China and I think, unfortunately, I think the current administration, the Trump administration is going to blink. And I think that because Huawei is such a huge issue for the Chinese and the, that we would prevent, um, our companies from selling into or purchasing from or dealing with and that we were, have sanctions on other countries that, that do. Um, they view that as such a threat to their own interests and their own future, um, that Huawei is front and center with any trade deal. So they're looking, they're not doing any trade deal unless we make concessions on Huawei. And I have a feeling the Trump administration is going to make those concessions because

Speaker 3:          01:17:38       from a political perspective, they want a trade deal. Right. And so far they've actually said to Google that Google is going to stop using the android operating system for the, for the Chinese phones, for walways phones, at least they're going to not let them license out the, so Walway has actually been at least rumored to be in production of their own operating system, which would mean they would have to have their own, not just operating system, but they, they'd have to have their own ecosystems. So they'd have to have an app store, they'd have to have all the, all the jazz that we have today. When you, if you sign up for, you buy an android phone, you have access to the Google play market, which is this huge resource of applications. And as soon as you take that away, you've got to kind of rebuild that whole thing from scratch. Right? Right. Well,

Speaker 2:          01:18:22       Huawei doesn't lack anything in resources, you know, there'll be fine, you know, because the state will provide and ensure that they have the resources they need. They also, you know, we're the outlier here, right? I mean, we've been working with New Zealand and Canada and the UK to some degree, but the UK has been, you know, they've been kind of pushing back a little bit on this idea that we're going to isolate

Speaker 3:          01:18:40       well, way I, I don't think that's going to happen. And so they're using Walway devices. Um, the, they, to some degree, yes. Uh, they've been slower to adopt [inaudible] and kind of mesh their infrastructure with while ways for people here, for people don't know what we're talking about. Could you please just lay out what's the concern? What do they think that we're always doing? Um,

Speaker 2:          01:19:01       Huawei is essentially, um, what's the, the, the way to put this would be, uh, imagine a communications network that spans the globe and, um, Huawei builds and provides, uh, gear and certainly going into 5g. Um, there are leading provider and Sir and financially they, they can offer countries a much better deals than, than other providers, but they are a, an intricate part of that communications web. So if you imagine that walkway is a state sponsored entity and will respond to Chinese authorities requests for information or intelligence that's passing through this communications web around the globe, our, uh, our business communications, our military communications, um, intelligence communications, that that all kind of go through at some point. This interconnected system, uh, that's the problem because they're essentially building back doors into that system that allow them to suck a communications out of that network and use it for their own purposes.

Speaker 2:          01:20:12       It's a great intelligence tool, right? So if you think about it in a way, basically that's a, it's a, uh, it's an advancement on the idea that you are wire tapping somebody or you know, you've, you've created ability to intercept some communications, right? They link themselves with the EU. What happens, we've got military communications, right? With the EU, our military talks to the military and we've got NATO concerns and everything. So if, if there's an element in that infrastructure that touches in and has a door that opens to some walkway gear, right? Then the danger here is, and they've, they've had back doors discovered in the past and then while we put your hands up and go, oh, well we didn't know that was there. We'll correct it. And then it turns out they don't correct it. And then, you know, oh, sorry about that.

Speaker 2:          01:20:56       You know, they, they, they honestly don't give a shit. They, I, when I say how aggressive they are in terms of sucking up information, I can't overstate it. Right? And so this, that's why it's a problem for us is because, you know, if we, if we convince, uh, Australia and, and you know, the five eyes, nations new is [inaudible] and in others not to work with wowway and then say Canada, you know, which is willing to do a deal. Well, we've got seamless communications infrastructure with Canada. So all of a sudden, the fact that they're doing business with Weiwei, but we're not, we're still at risk. We're still in jeopardy because that information is still flowing to some degree where it's accessible to, to Huawei and their ability to get. So I, you know, again, I know, and I know people listen to that and they go, ah, why is that of any concern?

Speaker 2:          01:21:45       Well, it's a concern because it used to be in the old days it was a, a, you know, uh, it was us in the Russians. So Union Russia's, you know, they got the GDP of a small EU nation. China is, is on the march. They, they, they view themselves in a certain fashion. That's why they're pushing down the south China Sea. They've been building up their military. They've been doing deals all over the world, uh, for rare earth minerals to, you know, to Labor, dosage, uh, uh, access to enable ports. It doesn't matter what it is, they've been busy doing that because they view themselves at the top of the food chain. Now I guess we could say, wow, okay fine. Maybe it's their turn or something, but I, that's not how I view the world. Right? I mean, we can either be on top of it, we can, you know, be sucking wind and, and so he goes back to that, one of those early questions you asked is how much did we spend on defense?

Speaker 2:          01:22:34       How much do we spend on, on Intel? How much do we spend on whatever it may be? And I think the answer is that's where intelligence comes in. You have to know what the opposite, what the hostile nation is doing. You have to know what the competitor's doing. It's just like in business. Then you have to spend enough to stay ahead of that, right? Even if it's a small amount, you gotta stay ahead, you gotta and it's it, it behooves us not to fall behind. Um, that's never a good thing. I know we don't always do things right, but as a nation, um, the world is much better off with us. I'm sort of at the end of, this is going to sound wrong to a lot of people, they're going to think, oh my God, that's terrible. But with us at the top, we're, we're more altruistic. Uh, maybe that is the Ed and that's the word not, but I think word. Yeah. So anyway, so I, that's, that's my view. A lot of people say

Speaker 3:          01:23:22       bullshit, but you know, everyone's got different experiences, you know. Well, is there a way to detect, like when they released, say if they release a Walway phone and which is a really rich, really interesting that just a few years ago, Walway was not even a major player by any stretch of the imagination. Now it's the number two cell phone provider in the world, a past apple, which is incredible when you consider the fact that they barely have a foothold in the American market. They very few people buy their phones and if they do buy their phones, they buy unlocked phones from overseas. Yeah. It's really kind of crazy. Um, but is there a way where they could detect whether or not there is a backdoor in these phones? I mean, or is it something where they could develop it to the point where you really would have no idea?

Speaker 2:          01:24:09       Um, no, we can, we, we stay pretty well, you know, that your, your, yeah, it's a good, it, it's a good question. But I, I would say that, uh, as long as we continue what we're doing in terms of, uh, counterintelligence and, and, uh, tech advances and efforts in, in cyberspace and elsewhere and certainly in communications hardware to stay ahead of potential hostile activity. I think we're, we're OK. We, we, we, we're good at detecting problems. We're good at identifying weaknesses in, in the systems. Um, the problem is, again, it's a global community. We can't isolate ourselves in terms of communications. Infrastructure just doesn't work. So you know, it's like a chain and a weak link. Okay. Yeah. See I gave that analogy. Yeah, good. Yeah. Thank you. I am [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:25:00       you are the weakest link. So yeah, it's, I mean, anyway, but that's Huawei and I, and I do think that it's

Speaker 2:          01:25:08       the interesting part will be what does the administration do in their desire to get a trade deal? Are they willing to blink on this because they put their foot down, right? And now because we're so dysfunctional here in the states from a political perspective,

Speaker 3:          01:25:21       now you've got people like Chuck Schumer going, well you know, Trump better not blink on this. This is boy. So suddenly Chuck Schumer is a hawk on his heart are protecting us from, from, you know, Chinese espionage. Right? And, but simply because, you know, he sees it as a political opening here. You know, if, if Trump backtracks on Huawei now, hey, good, from the democratic perspective, they can use that to bang on him, you know? And so it's all, it all comes down to politics. But, but this is something that people didn't even understand was an issue like good nationally. This is something that no one was even aware of until a few months ago. And when I started reading about it, one of the first things that I was reading about was, you know, I'm kind of a technology nerd and so I was fascinated by some of their newest phones, which were really far advanced to what you're

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       getting offered in the United States. Yeah. And a lot of that, uh, ability to, to create in record time, um, comes from [inaudible] property. Yeah. And that's how they, over the years, again, that was a, that was a collective decision by the authorities there that just, this is how we're going to advance. Right. And we, we, they looked and they make a calculation that says we can't afford to wait decades while we do our own research and development, you know, well, let's, let's just take it. And Weiwei is not the only Chinese phone manufacturer. There's quite a few different ones over there, but they're the only one that seems to be band. What's that other one? Zomy where there's, there's quite a few there are, but Huawei has been because of their size, their in their connection to the government. Um, and because of the resources that the government's been willing to, um, to provide to them the advantage that they have, um, and the speed with which they were able to kind of embed themselves into other nations, a telecommunications infrastructure.

Speaker 1:          01:27:05       That's why they're so important. Right. But the general, yeah. You know, are there other companies we, well, of course, yeah. I mean there's a variety of companies we should be worried about from that perspective. And it's not like that'd be fair. I spent some time on China because it's just, you know, they're the number one state, you know, sponsored perpetrator of theft of intellectual property. But you know, there's just other countries involved in it. So I'll copy entire cities, which is really insane. You've seen that they have a fake Paris over there. Yeah. Yeah. I know. Well, you know, they've got you go some of these places I went and looked at and in Chinese history, culture is fantastic. Right? And I've been over there and times and I've just like marveled at how, how, you know, how interesting the people are, how friendly they are, how, I mean they look this, there's a lot of wonderful things about China, but I'm just saying the authorities, right?

Speaker 1:          01:27:47       The government policy of um, no rule of law, of, of, of the no protection when it comes to intellectual property, all these things and their aggressiveness and stealing information and that's the problem. Um, but China as a country is, is a fascinating place. So, uh, that was, I don't know why I said that. That's my, it is a fascinating place. It's very, very, very, very, very old, which is something that we don't totally understand. That was like five varies. Like when you look at the history of China, it's really, it's amazing. Yeah. It goes back so far. When you look at this country, it's a couple of hundred years and that's it. Oh, I know that we come across a house, it's a hundred years old and someone slaps a historic thing on there and you can't stop me, can't do anything to it. And we've, we've faced that in the past.

Speaker 1:          01:28:31       When you guys got a house, it was built in the 20s and they have a historic thing then 19, 27 it'll be soon. It'll be the architecture of the 60s that we want to protect. Yeah. Probably plastic over couches. Remember that? Oh, that was, that was a good thing. Right. You know, and nobody wanted to sit on those in the summer, but what do you think is going to happen when you really think that the government's going to cave and they're going to give into a I think so because I think they really, they, they definitely want a trade deal in some capacity. And China's not going to blink on this, right. They'll, they'll figure out how to, how to kind of bear the burden of the tariffs and make things work on that, you know, for them to screen. Much gets built over the too. I mean, all the apple stuff's getting built over there now.

Speaker 1:          01:29:12       And there was just a recent story, uh, where Tim Cook was trying to get Trump to back down off of some tariffs because you know, we're going to have a 25% tariff on some apple products that they're building in China. Yeah. Yeah. And it's the idea that, look, it's not the idea that you can, yeah. Rob Huawei Revenue Jumps 23% despite us crackdown. Yeah. Because look over at C's, their phones are gigantic. They figured out, you know, Samsung made a huge, disastrous mistake with their galaxy fold. I don't know if you know, but the foldable phone, well, they have a mate x that apparently is way better than the galaxy fold. It's a better design and it's viable works. Yeah. Samsung's an incredible company and it's, it's got an amazing history of, of innovation and technology, but, but you're right, they have had a couple of, they've had a couple of missteps.

Speaker 1:          01:29:59       A fold wasn't the only one that they had a misstep on. Seven, the blow up. Right. That's a problem, right? When you get on the phone that explodes. That's not necessarily what you want in a communications device. What are you pointing out? The y way made x is not as good as I said. It says design changed just a few weeks before the release. Well, what's wrong even come out yet. It just does not change the, I don't know. Yeah, but it doesn't mean it's not better. Why you saying it means it's not better? The people that have tried it, if you said it's better, it's just saying it's last minute. Tweaks have been made to the devices ahead of the anticipated release in September as an additional sensor appears had been added to the phone's camera module. That's to find out where you live. Exactly.

Speaker 1:          01:30:39       I mean that doesn't mean it's not better, Jamie. I thought yet. So how would anybody know the people that have reviewed it? There's people that are reviewed it. All the tech sites I've written, they just changed it. You just don't like, yeah. Well they just tweet the sensor. You just talking shit over there, but he wants to go back to coffin on water. Are you anti hawala? No, no. They did use the Lichen name to like I little, I licensed it for their camera. I don't think that they're using like, like a cameras and other Nara. It's like a, I've used it, I use it at ces like three years ago. I thought they used liker cameras for the pro or whatever it is. They use the name, but I don't believe that it's, it's not, I mean it might be a like a sensor, but it's like a very, it's a micro chip.

Speaker 1:          01:31:20       It's compared to the one I have in this camera that's very expensive. It's not definitely it's been at all the camera, but I mean I think they use Leica lenses. Right. Or like a something good. Can we get to the bottom of this? When I was there lot, so I was super interested in it and I was trying to tell, I was like, what? What are they using about this name? There's a photographer I followed that was promoting it and I was like, just seems like they're using the name is all. I couldn't tell that it was a better photo. I couldn't tell. You don't even have [inaudible] my age, but that's all I couldn't tell at all. No, they're not. Right. Again, I'm just saying I couldn't tell, but as a photographer I couldn't. I could like all you're using is the name. This isn't a better photo. It's not, doesn't have the value. With the like what I was getting have some pretty

Speaker 3:          01:31:59       spectacular cameras though. To me, I mean they had the very best ever night vision camera, not night vision but night sight. Like the ability to take photographs at night and it looks like pull up a Huawei night photograph examples cause Google Pixel three is the second best one, but the last one is supposedly the Walway one. Zoom came out a couple months ago and people were saying that that was bullshit, which put us out. It was like I had a super zoom technology lens that people were at. Someone was far as like, there's no way that that's real. But who said it's no way that that's real photographers, photographers, reviewers, people that are using this stuff and said, but they weren't using this though. Just one thing improved. Okay. One thing has been proven that Weiwei has taken some photographs and said they were taken out of Weiwei phone and they were actually taken on a very high end or something like, yeah, very high end camera. Oh. Also Weiwei posted some stuff on Instagram from iPhones, caught a couple of times, cut a couple times doing that, which is also quite hilarious. But, um, yeah, it's a, it's a sneaky business and if, if that's how they're going to do it, they're going to get in through the back door and get information through phones and modems and,

Speaker 2:          01:33:14       and it may not be, you know, it, it, it may not be something that they worry about now in terms of access. And when people say, well, why did they want the access now? They just want to know that they can, I mean, imagine a conflict in the future where they have that ability, right. Either to a realtime monitor communications through this network that they've been able to build trapdoors into, um, you know, or to impact the flow of communication more aggressively, more proactively to, to do things. Uh, it's, you know, it's, it's like, um, it's like mapping out our infrastructure, right? Um, the testing, the probing that goes on of our, um, of our electrical grid as an example. I mean, that's just planning for the future in, in, in the event that something bad's going to happen. If there's going to be a conflict, you know, they, they want to know as do we, I mean, again, to your point that, you know, hopefully we're doing the same stuff and, and um, so yeah, it's something else interesting when you're talking about China though, is, and you think about, okay, what should we be watching?

Speaker 2:          01:34:10       And we touched on Russia a little bit is the alliance between possible alliance between Russia and China. And it's an interesting dynamic. You know, traditionally Russia, China haven't been together. Um, they've always been some areas of concern. Um, you know, um, uh, distrust. Uh, but if there are signs, there are things happening that appear as if China and Russia have made a strategic decision to align themselves closer. And that would be because they've made that determination that somehow it's in their best interest of, you know, and not necessarily that it's going to be that way for any long period of time, but right now in the current environment, um, you see Russia, um, acting as if what they want is a stronger alliance, military alliance and political alliance, economic alliance

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       with China. Um, and it's, it's, it's an interesting dynamic that we need to be watching, we need to be aware of. Um, and, and part of that is, you know, people again this, this idea that, you know, there was this Russia, uh, Trump collusion. And I'm thinking, okay, well that's good, except our relations with Russia have been this bad in a long time. So maybe it's all a very clever mind game that they're playing because they're closely aligned. But I don't think so. So we've actually, um, um, laid on more, uh, significant sanctions on Russia. Uh, we've attacked them from an energy perspective in terms of our ability to, um, create our independence, you know, particularly from, from, uh, natural gas, um, that has damaged Russia's abilities. So I think there's reasons why they're gravitating towards China right now. But this idea that somehow Trump is super friendly and as a useful idea of Putin, it doesn't, it doesn't play out when you look at the reality of the relationship, uh, between the two countries. That whole Russian collusion thing is a very confusing there because on one hand you have the Democrats who are saying without doubt there's Russian collusion. And then the other side you have the Republicans and say the Mueller report essentially exonerated Trump from being a part of any sort of Russian collusion. I don't think either one is totally accurate. I think there's a lot of like weird gray. Yeah, well both narratives. I think

Speaker 2:          01:36:26       the Democrat narrative is easier to understand. It just makes sense from their perspective. Right. Why wouldn't, why wouldn't we push that? Um, to this day they're just still amazed that they, they lost. And so there must be some grander reason why, because we just clearly we couldn't lose to this guy. Right. So, and, and it was also a talking point, much like, you know, let's hit everybody with the racist hammer. It's a talking point and it's worked for them over there. The police the first couple of years,

Speaker 1:          01:36:53       um, on the, on the, on the, on the Republican side, um, look, the Russians

Speaker 2:          01:37:00       knew what they were doing, right? They were fucking with the election on several different levels. And it wasn't just trolling through the Internet. It wasn't, you know, just placing stories that they could, it wasn't just trying to foam it, you know, a divisiveness and discontent. It was also doing these little dangle things, you know, where they're, you know, they're looking to see what are they going to bite and what are they gonna do. You know what I mean? You think about that Christopher Steele dossier and it was a piece of shit. I mean, if we saw that in the commercial side of things, you know, I've got a business in global intelligence and, and, and research and security. Um, that thing was just, there was nothing. It was shot full of holes. Right. And so you think, well, what's somebody should have asked, tell me about your sources.

Speaker 2:          01:37:38       You know, why are your sources talking? What, what was, you know, you've got gotta anytime you've got a piece of intelligence, right, you've gotta do a few basic things, you know, where'd it come from? Cause you explained to people with the Steele dossier was all about, yeah, it was basically just looked, they were going after opposition research, political opposition research, right? So a Christopher Steele who was a, you know, a paid a hired consultant, he used to be with British intelligence, not, you know, not a James Bond type. Um, but you know, a decent enough, by all accounts, a decent enough guy. Um, but he entered the world of private sector information gathering, right? And I've got a company, that's what we do all around the world. And, and you, um, you can't relax your standards just because you're now in the commercial sector, right? When you get a piece of information, you need to test that piece of information.

Speaker 2:          01:38:27       And one of the first things you need to do is understand what's the sourcing for it and why did, why did they have access, you know, how credible are they, what's their track record and why, by the way, are they providing this information and how did it eventually, you know, make its way to this report. And those are the sort of simple things that whether you're a a corporation that's gathering intelligence about a market that you may enter with, uh, you know, an investment, um, or whether you're still in the business and you're an intel officer and you're, you know, talking to a source that works in some foreign ministry somewhere, you've gotta be able to, you know, stress test the intelligence and, and Shit wasn't done. People, people liked what they saw, they saw negative information about the, the, the candidate and just run with that shit.

Speaker 2:          01:39:11       Right. And the more times you, it's like, it's like the old WMD reporting that came out of the early days in Iraq. The more you repeat it, even if it's one source and that sources is a piece of shit. And what you repeated, people are going to buy it. Right? So Russian collusion, Russian collusion, you just keep repeating that and that it's going to happen. At some point it will happen. But, um, anyway, so, but it seems like Russia definitely likes to disrupt our democracy. Absolutely. And they would still benefit of that. Well, a part of it is, um, in, in the old days, it was sort of a struggle for supremacy in the world, right? I mean, that was, that's Kinda at its core. That's what it was. Right. Um, and their ability to chip away and faith in democratic institutions was at the core of a lot of the crap that they pulled.

Speaker 2:          01:39:57       And it still is. I mean, so that's all the, when you're talking about a propaganda effort, like the, uh, the screwing with the last election, um, what's their goal when the goal isn't necessarily that, that's where they, they, you know, do they care whether one candidate or another wins? Well, maybe, maybe they do. Right. But you'd be hard pressed to argue that, you know, they were working against, uh, Hillary Clinton who had said, you know, we want to have a reset and, you know, and, and have a new relationship with Russia and work with them. I mean, maybe they looked at Trump and thought, yeah, that's the guy we want to work with. But over that, the more important issue was in just chipping away at, at, at, at Americans, belief in democratic institutions get us all so that we questioned the credibility of, of a democracy.

Speaker 2:          01:40:42       And that's been the fundamental belief for propaganda efforts within the old KGB and now the FSU. And, and so it's, it's, you know, it's as simple as that in a way. Um, and it worked. I mean, look at this, you know, we spent years now just bitching at each other and yelling and screaming and complaining. And we bought into it because we all, like we talked about before, we all, you know, we're easily duped and, and I don't know how you get around that. I don't know how he walked that back. Maybe we don't. But, um, I think it's an informed public that that helps to battle this. But we haven't, we lost sight of what was important here. And that is, and so I think the public needs, it's their responsibility. You like this. Yeah. You like where you live, then you gotta make an effort to try to keep it right.

Speaker 2:          01:41:27       And, and part of that is being an informed public and understanding what the hostile elements may be out there. You know, without being paranoid, but just understand why they're doing things in the way that the world operates. You know? And you'll always have that group of people that, you know, don't buy into any of that bullshit and think it's all just, we should all be holding hands. Yeah. That's a, that's, that's a fun one. That's, that's a fun narrative. It's a good narrative. It's a happy narrative. Yeah. Right. When you've talked to people that have seen terrible things that take place all around the world, that narrative is hard to swallow. When you read about these gang members that are coming in and growing pot and fucking shooting at people and they've got these high level task force just to deal with these cartel members that have grown weed.

Speaker 2:          01:42:11       Right. And this is right. And that's just one part of what they're doing. Right. That's just tends to human trafficking and everything else that they get involved in extortion to know, which is probably the scariest shit. Yeah. Yeah. And that's it. And that's, that's what you have to worry about if you, if you have pushed them out of the market because you legalize everything, which, you know, I assume that's kind of the direction we're going. Um, then do they fill that gap again from a revenue perspective with fentanyl or something else? Whatever the next to choice is, how do you stop the infiltration? How do you stop the gang members were coming in here. I mean, how do you do that other than eliminating them other than having some sort of a tactical devastation? Well, that seems like the only operation that would make any sense in my mind.

Speaker 2:          01:42:52       Yeah. Well, it's like jihadism, you can't kill your way out of it, right? It doesn't mean you shouldn't make a good faith effort, but, um, it's, uh, for the, for the, for the drug control, uh, for the narcotics counter narcotics, um, part of it is what we talked about also about working with the other governments, right? We've had some success in doing that where you work with the Mexican authorities, you work with the Colombians or Allen, Southeast Asia, you know, to try to, you know, uh, push on the back on the heroin trade. Um, and so you work through them to some degree, but that's tough, right? That's corruption. There's so much corruption and that's, and that's, that's the problem. And it's, and it's unsatisfying because you don't see an immediate return sometimes, and it's, and it's also, it's, uh, sometimes seems like it's just a big, you know, a bottomless pit where you're tossing money, right?

Speaker 2:          01:43:40       And effort and resources, but it's something that has to be done. Doesn't mean you shouldn't still do it. Um, but it is, I mean, corruption in a place like Mexico, right? Where the people just don't have any faith in the institutions, right. Because they've lived in this system for so long where all the officials in their minds anyway are corrupted. The police are corrupted, federal is a corrupt, um, you know, the, the marines down in Mexico, probably the most trusted institution. Um, because they're not viewed in the same vein. They're not viewed as corrupt, but only the marines. Well, yeah, pretty much. I mean, that's a, which it's odd, but it's a, it's a, that's a large organization and they've been able to kind of stay above the fray to some degree, which is interesting. I have no idea. But it's, um, it's been the perception and just for the most part, it's, it's true.

Speaker 2:          01:44:28       When you work down there often enough, you do get that impression, but it's how you get rid of that endemic corruption in that society. Um, and turn that public perception around, you know, because that will impact. But I mean, look what happened, you know, previous administration when they, they seriously went after cartel members. Right? Remember that spree of violence that, that kicked off. It was in part because the Mexican authorities were going after cartels in a more serious manner, right. They previous to that they were managing the problem. So they said, okay, look, let's manage down the violence everybody and we'll let you keep doing your business. It's going to happen so you guys do your business, but just, you know, let's keep sort of public order, you know, as, as something that we want to demonstrate that we're capable of. And when you have to, when they went after the cartels in a more serious manner, um, that's when that real parse spree of violence kicked off.

Speaker 2:          01:45:20       And you know, there was more head room. So these, you know, these various members were, you know, they, they were combating each other and they were going after the public. They understood that they had to, you know, basically wear down the public, which is what happened. The public said after a while they said, fuck it, we can't deal with this. The violence is too much. It's awful. And so government, you know, eventually went back to managing the problem. Drug trade didn't go away. Of course when they just went back to the old waves of doing things so that the violence is just so intense that the public eventually just said, we can't know. And, and I think the cartels knew that they understood that. Right. And so they were willing to do it. Um, well, the, the most ridiculous aspect was that fat fast and the furious deal where they were literally selling drugs to the cartels so they could track them.

Speaker 2:          01:46:05       And those drugs we use to eventually kill some US officers. Right? Yeah. I mean it was, yes, I say it was drugs, drugs, weapons, drugs. Yeah. Yeah. Conflating things. Yeah. Those guns that they used, they did kill officers, right? Yeah. There was, there was a, an officer in particular was that was killed and, and the, the fast and furious, anytime you talk about time, you talk about, uh, as part of a intelligence collection effort, right. Um, or law enforcement effort that you're going to supply the hostile meant with weapons or whatever it may be. Um, Eh, it's going to go, it's probably going to go sideways. Right. Seems like a great way to cover the fact that you were selling guns. I mean, if I was really skeptical, I would say, well, what are you going to do? We're going to sell them guns. How the fuck are you gonna sell them guns?

Speaker 2:          01:46:55       Well, we're going to say that it's an intelligence gathering thing. Sound guns. Yeah. We have some really cynical, which a lot of people aren't. A lot of people are. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I mean, I think it was, it was a fucked up operation. There's no doubt about it. And I, I'm not a fan of, you know, it's, it's sort of like the same in the gray arms marketing, you know, sort of on a global basis. When you talk about, you know, like, you know, because you're getting, what are you looking to do? You're looking to create movement, track, you know, movement of, of, of gear or money or resources or personnel the way there's ways you can do that without creating a potential for a complete goat rope. And unfortunately, fast and furious did that and had to be a goat rope. You're giving people the ability to kill people.

Speaker 2:          01:47:35       You giving them guns. Yeah. Like why do they have chips on the guns? Like how they even tracking these goddamn guns. Yeah. It sources method shit. But um, it's, yeah, I going back to Mexico. And how do you, you know, how do you resolve that? Because that impacts, again, that impacts us. It impacts our national security. Right. And so, well, they're literally connected to us. We're so concerned with Afghanistan and Iraq, they're nowhere near us and we've got this thing connected to us that's literally filling this country with illegal drugs. They sell Meth, they sell fentanyl. Dan Afghanistan, fuck that. Coming up on another election, presidential election in mid, I think mid September, you gotta run, you're not thinking about it. I'm thinking about moving the family over there and thinking of Afghanistan. Yeah. I could, me and Boris Johnson and Trump would get together, but uh, yeah, no, they've had an increase in bombings, you know, Taliban stepping it back out or, and I mean, we don't think about it.

Speaker 2:          01:48:33       Nobody wants to think about that shit anymore. You think about how many years, you know, we've been digging in and it always comes back to the same thing, the Taliban, and what do we think was going to happen? They got no place else to go. Right. And so difficult to track them down the mountains and they, and they, they will just wait it out. Right. And so here they're back again. They're increasing bombings. They want to take, you know, they want to take over again. And it's just so you're right in a sense. Um, we, did we take her off the ball? Yeah, we did. Yeah. And were there other issues that we should have been more focused on? Yeah, yeah, sure. But, you know, then you're conflicted because you think of all those people that fought and died over there and the effort that other people that came back and you know, with, with, you know, horrible wounds and, and the trauma of all of that.

Speaker 2:          01:49:19       And, you know, I feel somewhat conflicted because then you talk about, you know, I don't, you don't want to, you don't want to minimize their, what they did right for the country. Um, but you also have a, an obligation, I think they look at policy and what did we do and what was the purpose of it was the point of that exercise. Um, and I don't think we still to this day, no, right? I mean, what are we gonna create some pseudo state, federal government there that's going to be a bastion of democracy and it's not going

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       to happen. So anyway, I don't want it disappeared on the Afghanistan rabbit hole, but we'd like to think that we could turn that into another America. That's what we like to think when we think about nation building, that we think that we can go in there and establish democracy and these people are going to be better and they're gonna be able to go to school and it's going to change the whole environment.

Speaker 2:          01:50:05       Yeah. Yeah. I guess. And that is true. And we talked about Iraq that way. If we just make a rock a bastion of democracy, then maybe it'll help to turn the tide in the Middle East and suddenly it will have more of a respect for individual liberties and rights and all the rest of that and how that worked out. You know, I, I'm, I'm still looking into it. It's, um, I'll come back again and I'll give you my report. I think it's going to be negative. 1 million people have done. Yeah. It's, yeah. It's not good. Right? It's, that's typically never good when you get, you get to those numbers. A large number. Yeah. Um, but again, look at it. I mean, the, the shit that we don't want to talk about it. Look, we don't tell them about Syria, right. Nobody wants to talk about Syria and that and you know, Assad, you know his butcher, he's still in charge.

Speaker 2:          01:50:45       Why is he charged with it? Because Russia propped him up and want to Russia proper along with Iran. Right. As there's a, there's a nasty piece of work there. And as an access goes, um, you know, Russia had no intention of letting Assad go. [inaudible] we should have been able to figure that one out. Right. But we didn't, in part because we have these, these, these impulses that say, well, we're gonna do better. And because we're gonna create this ability for people to, you know, uh, create their own democracy. So, um, yeah. So anyway, we, uh, we, Syria is again, one of those places that nobody really wants to discuss or talk about. And we've got, we've got attention deficit disorder. Nobody talks about North Korea anymore. I remember we were all going to get blown up by Kim Jong Un. Yeah. Eh,

Speaker 1:          01:51:29       well, there's pictures of Trump shaking his hands. So we're, we're buddies now. Go home. We're all good. All good. I mean, the last article I read about North Korea was about how did Kim Jong Un get his Mercedes since there's some sort of a, she's a boycott or a, you know, embargo.

Speaker 2:          01:51:45       Yeah. Well, and that's, you know, that's another part of it is, is uh, um, although we have been, we've, we've been more successful, I will say this, we've been more successful than, than in the past. And part of that is a technology issue. We've gotten better at imposing and, um, enforcing sanctions than we used to be. And part of that is because our, our abilities to understand a movement of money, uh, tracking transactions, um, is better than it used to be. So the sanctions as an example we put on around, um, this, yeah, this is the most difficult time that this regime has faced in Iran since the fall of, of the shawl. And it's because we've gotten better at looking at, uh, Russia, China in particular, that have traditionally always kind of circumvented the sanctions. We're better at enforcing that and were better at, at working with the EU and pressuring them.

Speaker 2:          01:52:39       Right. I mean, so that's, that's a good thing. Um, but I don't know where that's, you know, I mean, Iran is kind of flailing a bound a little bit. They seized the tanker, you know, British tank or they actually used a couple, but they're holding onto one. Um, in response to, they were trying to ship a bunch of oil over to Syria and against sanctions that exist. Right. So, so they had a tanker that was taken 2 million barrels or whatever, of oil over to Syria. And the British, um, in the territorial waters of Gibraltar, uh, intercepted that ship now, uh, beginning of July and in response, um, the Iranians have done a number of things right? But the most recent thing that they've done was they seized a British flag tanker and they're still holding the crew. And, um, that's sort of an example of their, I don't wanna say they're desperate, right?

Speaker 2:          01:53:29       Because they've got an ability, I think to withstand in a, their control over the Po population is so strong, but it's an example, I think to some degree of, of them flailing a bit and trying to figure out what are they going to do, what's their next move. And, uh, I know people say, well, we shouldn't have gotten out of the deal and we shouldn't, you know, we shouldn't have this issue anyway because we, you know, it's Trump's fault for getting out of the deal. Um, but you know, they, again, I don't have a lot of confidence in, in, in them, uh, sticking to the terms. And agreements of any deal because they've never done in the past and there's always been an effort and they've always broken the agreement. So I don't know why suddenly they would change their tune if we can keep the sanctions on hard enough and force them to the table.

Speaker 2:          01:54:09       The only thing they care about is staying in power. If they think they're going to lose that grip on power, they'll come to the table and then make a better deal. And that deal would include us being able to access their military facilities. And for inspections we couldn't, we had no access to any other military sites in that country because now we didn't make it a condition of the deal. Right? So we basically said, sure, we want verification that you are following the agreements. And they said, well fuck you. This is the, these are the places that we agreed to let you look at that. That was the, I don't want to oversimplify, but that was the terms of the deal. And so we, we, any deal that we do with them in the future needs to be able to say, no, we want a hundred percent verification. Because as John Kerry said, that's what you want. You wanna be able to verify.

Speaker 3:          01:54:47       So when we heard about it, what we're hearing in the news from the people that are opposed to the deal is that Trump broke this deal and he was foolhardy to do so that Obama had put in place this deal and that Trump had broken. And it sort of leaves us in this terrible quagmire. Right? But what you're saying is that the deal was terrible and that they, it didn't really give us access to understand exactly what their nuclear program was with their military program was. So it wasn't a good deal. It wasn't, it wasn't wise to keep keep

Speaker 2:          01:55:15       it if you're, if you're, um, if, if the way that you judge the of the value of a deal and they, this is what the previous administration, the Obama ministration did, was to talk about how, you know, it's important that we verify and we've got verification. Well, yeah, you've got verification of the sites that the Iranians agreed to let us look at that. And so yeah, it was a deal. Was it a good deal? No, they wanted this, they wanted to sign this deal in. The Iranians knew it. And so, um, yeah, I think that that justified saying, no, we're going to redraw this. And even the EU, which has been clinging to the, the old agreement, even the EU says, well yeah, we, we could improve it. We could make it better, but there's no, if you just keep things as they were, there's no incentive for the Iranian regime to, to make any concessions or improve it.

Speaker 2:          01:56:04       So the point being is we're going, we're trying to force them back to the negotiating table and again, given that their self interest is to stay in power and remain in charge, then you know, if with the economy in the condition that it's in currently, if it gets much worse than they feel as if they're losing a grip on, on, on the, the population, then I suspect they will come there. They're not going to lash out, that Iran doesn't want a, nobody wants a military conflict. We don't want it. They don't want it, Yada, Yada. Can they close the Strait of Hormuz, you know, where, you know, depending on who you're talking to, a fifth of the world's oil passes through or, um, yeah, they could close the temporarily or cause some friction, but they don't have the ability to shut it down for any, any real period of time. Um, we've just got too much, uh, in terms of leverage over there and our assets. And so, yeah, I, you know, who knows, but I, I, I'm one of those people that says, you know, we, we shouldn't have done that deal until we got it right. And just saying, we've got to deal for the sake of it because you had

Speaker 3:          01:57:02       partial verification doesn't give you anything. We've, we've had partial verification of their programs for decades. Um, and they just keep advancing their program. So do you think this criticism of backing out of the deal that you're hearing from Democrats is basically just a criticism of Trump to show an opportunity to, yeah. Everything's a Curtis, I think everything is a criticism of Trump. Is that a problem? [inaudible] because Trump has such a polemic figure because he's so many people just hate him that any opportunity to have some sort of political talking point against him sort of, uh, confuses what the actual issue is itself.

Speaker 2:          01:57:41       Yeah. I mean, I think there's no doubt he's, he, yeah. I think what happens is both sides we lose, uh, in this one because the Democrats sort of blindly, you know, accuse him of a, everything's bad, right? And no matter what he's doing, no matter what policy is, it's all bad, right? And so, so that's not what you want to be. And on the Republican side, you know, you tend to think that that's the case. And so, you know, you don't have an honest, um, intelligent discussion about the policy landscape. Right? And so you again, it was sitting in trenches, throwing hand grenades together. It's like World War One, right? And nobody's going to get out and venture into no man's land in the center and nobody's living in the center anymore. So I just think, um, everybody, it's a disservice to everybody. But yes, I think almost things that have come out of Capitol Hill right now is based on, um, on, uh, you know, look, here's, here's an example.

Speaker 2:          01:58:38       My daughter went, um, she just got out of Grad school and she's done a number of internships. She's worked over in Asia. She's been in China on, on, on, uh, internships and she's, you know, smart kid. I'm subjective, smart kid, but she went for a job up in Capitol Hill and it was not a direct hire, meaning they'd office had to go through the, um, the, the, uh, other offices to get approval to hire an individual to fill this position. And because the house is controlled by Democrats now, uh, she was, uh, it, everybody looked and said, yeah, she's a top candidate. We want to offer the job. Well, what happened was they submitted her details. So we want to hire this person to this office within the Capitol Hill controlled by the Democrats now because it's the House majority. And they came back and said, no, because you know why?

Speaker 2:          01:59:29       Because she did an internship in the current administration, right? So young person wanting to work in DC, uh, in policy and security studies and elsewhere doing a variety of internships around the globe, does an internship at the White House. Normally you would think that's a good thing, right? But so they said, no, because she did this internship with the White House. We're not going to approve the hiring. And then it turns out, well, she did an internship and build the Blasio's office too. Right. And so they said that, and the response was, well, we don't like him either. So, which I think was that actually provided some humor, right. To the whole situation. But it shows you not, I mean that, that's a little tiny thing and it's a personal issue, but, but it shows you Washington d C is possibly the most dysfunctional location in all of North America. Um, that's terrible. Yeah. And it's, and it's, uh, and it's not the way it should be. We should be able to have policy discussions. We should be able to make decisions. You may not like Trump, you may not have liked the previous president, but you know, again, w we gotta stop this bullshit where everybody's a racist. Everybody's a sexist. Everybody's like you, you, it's not the way this country's supposed to work. And people, you know, you can't even get away from,

Speaker 3:          02:00:41       okay, well who's at fault? Everybody's at fault, right? Well, does the left are all guilty of, of creating this divisiveness? What is this, the cure to outrage culture? I mean, how do you get past this? That's the real question, right? I mean, what is the, I don't see a map and I was going to ask you this about foreign policy because as a guy who has been involved in the CIA for as long as you have and has seen all the inner workings of government and all the conflict and d, do you ever feel like you just, we're just running up a 70 degrees sand dune that you're never going to get to the top of? You know what I mean? It just seems like it never ends. I mean, you're just basically trying to like, oh, there's another hole in the dike. Let me put my finger on this one. Oh, water's coming out of this one. Let me get my finger in this one. And it never ends running up the sand Dune. That's a good, that's a good, uh, analogy, right? It seems like a million mile high sand dune and it is, I think it's always looked at. DC has always been divisive. Politics have always created the division.

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       The press has always been biased in one way or another. You know, these things aren't new, but, and we always tend to think it's the worst we've ever seen. It looked, the civil war was pretty bad. That was pretty divisive. So, yeah. So when you have a politician, like, like I think it was Joe Biden, right? That, that said that the president is, is the most, um, you know, uh, racist, you know, president we've ever had. And you think, well, I don't know. That's an own slaves. Exactly. 12 presidents own slaves. I think that might've been a problem, but, yeah. So, so, and, or the race relations are the worst they've ever been. And you think, yeah. How about the 60s? That was pretty bad, right? And the civil war. And I think so every, every time is, yeah, I know. And, but I guess my point being is that, you know, you can, you can fall into that trap where you think it's as bad as it's ever been.

Speaker 2:          02:02:27       Um, it's, I think it's fair to say that it is more polarizing now than in recent times. And how do we walk it back? How do we dial it down a little bit and how do we actually focus on what's important for the general population? There's a lot of big issues we should be solving, right? I mean, but, but look at the insanity of, of when we talk about healthcare, right? It's like, oh, it's gotta be all this, or it's gotta be all that. Nobody's over in the middle saying, well, you know, you could take a little bit of this and that. And again, how do you walk that back? It's way above my pay grade. I hunkered down in Idaho and I'd, I'd go fishing and I don't think about it.

Speaker 3:          02:03:02       I don't see any solution that anybody has that makes any sense. And that's one of the things that terrifies me. And I don't want to just step away. I don't want to be that guy that moves to fucking

Speaker 2:          02:03:12       Idaho. Yeah. I'd love to see Alberta. Oh, there you go. [inaudible] the North Saskatoon, Edmonton New Zealand. [inaudible] oh yeah, it is. I love Edmonton. Yeah. But I mean, it's like what we're doing in Edmonton, UFC. Oh, okay. On a show. Oh, you did river creek.

Speaker 3:          02:03:30       So, you know, yeah. It's, um, I just feel like there's no real general solution, nor is there a map of a potential solution. And in La, I mean, and if we get a Democrat in the White House, it's not gonna end. Do Remember when Obama was in office, they were mad that he wore a gray suit or a Tan suit, a Tan suit, making fun of his suit. Like the fuck. Do you care? This is all you care. But it's like this polarization, the Fox News versus MSNBC polarization that doesn't help anybody. And it's, fuck, it's so bananas that if you have a podcast like mine and I have a, a left wing person on, I'm a sell out. If I have a right wing person on, I'm a Nazi and it just goes back and forth. You can't even talk to people anymore, which is

Speaker 2:          02:04:16       no, no, it does, it comes down to you can't have policy differences anymore. Right. It's gotta be some personal animus that you've got towards that other individual, which is, it's again, his, his, uh, his, his horseshit. You can have policy differences with, with people. Um, and that doesn't make you a bad person.

Speaker 1:          02:04:37       It doesn't make you a, you know, they share, those are the races that the question fricking races out there. Right. But that's, we've lost the meaning of the term when you just start hurling that around at anybody you disagree with. Right. Or when people say, well, if you like Trump, you're a racist. Right? Well, congratulations. You're probably driving those people to definitely vote for him in 2020. So that's one thing that I completely agree with you on that. I think that this idea that everybody who supports Trump is racist. It makes those people so angry that they just want to go, okay, I'm going to, well, you're obviously nuts. I can't, I can't be on your side. You people are crazy. You want to open up the borders and you want to take all the money from the everybody that's a hardworking American, give it to all the poor people and fuck you.

Speaker 1:          02:05:20       And it's like the arguments just get so confused. Yeah. I not on the words. I mean, if you think about who, who might win, you know, I don't think Joe Biden's gonna last. I think they're going to eat him alive. It's not, yeah, he's not going make it. It's going to be, I think Bernie and Carmela Harris and um, Tulsi Gabbert, those are the only ones that makes Kelsey makes sense to me. She's a veteran congresswoman for six years. She seems incredibly honest and to her morals and our ethics are on point. I like her. She's my favorite. But, um, if the, the left is going to have someone, they're going to have to be able to deal with Trump's insults. You're going to be able to debate him and that's where they all fall apart because they, they're trying to use that old model of politics and he's not doing that.

Speaker 1:          02:06:05       He's a showman. And I think what's happening is that the pope looked at the people that count in this in the primary or you know, that's a completely different bag right there. Then what goes on in the general, and I think the people that are in the primary right now, all those people are going to be voting in the primary. They're watching like these debates as an example or they're just watching the daily Twitter, Twitter feed from these people, the candidates, and they're thinking, can I see this person debating Trump? Right? And so the not only are the policies that these candidates are spouting are moving further and further to the left, which is going to make it harder when the general election comes to shift to the center and not gonna be able to do it right. That center is now shifted further to left if they even make the effort to get back there.

Speaker 1:          02:06:50       But you know, you're, you're getting sort of like the worst, um, instincts coming off from these candidates because they think, well, I got to show that I can throw a fire bomb here because they're looking at me as, you know, can I debate Trump? Right? And so you're gonna, you're gonna get somebody who's not. So I don't think Tulsa Gavin's gonna make it because I think they're gonna make that calculation. I think that they've probably going to look in there. You're gonna end up with, with Harris or maybe Warren Warren is not gonna make it. I don't know. Amanda American thing's gonna say, cause you would think so, right? You would think so. Harvard actually touted her and some of their literature when they were talking about their diversity efforts over the years, there's actually documents where Harvard was saying, you know, hey, and we hired, you know, at first native American, you know, professor and you're thinking, that's a statistic I am 200 times more African than is native American.

Speaker 1:          02:07:37       How bout that? Basically African, uh, are Ya? Yeah. I didn't know that 1.6%. 1.6%. Yeah. From where we know 23andme, I did one of them [inaudible] place today. It's a whole continent. Someone from that continent fucked one of my ancestors. What did you find out in South Africa though, Dan? It's not quite as, yeah. Yeah. It's not quite, it's interesting, but yeah. Well that's a Dutch, right? Yeah. You get Dutch jabs. Boar Board. Yeah. Um, yeah, I haven't done that. You know, my daughter did it and, um, I have not done that. I had, I actually had a conversation the other day about this whole thing about the desire to know your ancestry and everything. And I, my dad, uh, uh, came over, uh, never talked about his background, ever talked about his family. Um, CIA dad, yeah. Put this in there to keep his mouth shut. But uh, and so he never, he never demonstrated that interest.

Speaker 1:          02:08:28       Right. And so therefore, I don't think I've ever been, I've never just been that focused on it. Um, everything was in there that I knew was in there. Mostly Italian, a little bit of Irish, but some weird shit, like 1% Asian. I thought that was odd to any Scottish. Nope. It's always a little Scottish floating around out there like to fuck. Yeah, yeah, that's right. They get out. They get out bout. Um, yeah. Uh, yeah. I Dunno. I'm the where it's all going. But I do think that Warren, it could be viewed. I don't, I don't, I don't like her, but I think that she will, I think the base looks at her and thinks, yeah, she could be a firebrand. You can do this. After that whole native American thing, she built her career on a lie. They don't care. They, that base doesn't care.

Speaker 1:          02:09:11       That's the problem. America cares. You can't look past at the same way. You couldn't look past Hillary being a liar. Hillary tried to say that her name came from Edmund Hillary, the guy who climbed Mount Everest. He climbed Mount Everest three years after she was born. But you know, when he was still quite the character before, so, you know, it was still throwing that name around. Uh, yeah. But, uh, more than three years. Yeah. Yeah. Um, after she was born. It might've been seven years, but you think it won't be, I don't think it'll be Bernie. I don't think you know John Democratic Socialism. Well, I'll tell you so much. You go up to Vermont and look around for Mont and see what kind of job Bernie's done in. How about Pete? Did you do a judge Judy? Judge, he treated, they fucking hate him in his own city. Mayor Pete, they're pissed at him in south bend.

Speaker 1:          02:09:59       They wouldn't call him a ticket with the blast. You, that'd be a powerful mayoral ticket right there. There's no one person that stands out. There's no one person that like stands out as someone who's kind of when, you know, everyone's like, Ooh, could this person make it? Could that person make it? And then there's people that want to challenge Trump, which is hilarious. Well, I think there's going to be, we're going to lose a lot of these folks after this next round of the, which I guess tonight, tomorrow night is, um, I think there's a, it's not an a and a B card, but there's two nights, two nights of debates. Cause there's so many of them. There's bouts, bouts. Did you see the pack fight? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I always see. Great man. I got to tell you, I drop Sturman in the first round.

Speaker 1:          02:10:35       They know Thurman's a beast too, man. That's crazy. It was a, it was, that was a great moment. And then it was a, it was an interesting fight and I thought, I wasn't quite sure at the end where it was going to go, but I liked, I've watched pack you'll over the years. And I did. There was kind of that typical, you know, you get older and you're kind of rooting for the old guy. Right? He's 40 years old. He's the oldest man to ever capture the welterweight title. And particularly when you consider those lighter weight classes, like foreman won the heavyweight title at 46, which was crazy. Yeah. But pack. Yeah. Winning the welterweight title at forties fucking bunny working their ass off. I mean, it was just, it was, it was, it was a good, good fight. I really enjoyed that. That was first time I really watched a fight that I really enjoyed, right.

Speaker 1:          02:11:16       Beginning to end. And uh, and I was with some folks who were, were, who were not for Paki and I kept looking at, I'm thinking, how do you not like, he's the old guy. He's been doing this forever. He's a senator. Yeah. Think about that. That's crazy. Going back to work on a budget issues in the Philippines after the fight. That's crazy. Yeah. Yeah. I think he made 10 million on that, I think. Yeah. Good. Yeah. Good for him. Yeah. Yeah. Keith Thurman too. He made two and a half. It's got some chatter now. Key College boy. I love it. It May, whether it was in the audience. Yeah. Yeah. Well that would be fantastic if the, I mean, now's the time to do it if Mayweather really wants to do it, but may with a metal, watch that fight and go. Yeah. Because the first time they fought pack y'all at a blown out shoulder and then that was a lot of people were angry.

Speaker 1:          02:11:57       There was actually even talk of a class action lawsuit against Pacquiao bef uh, after the fight because people had bet on him and his shoulder was fucked up going, he'd heard it in training and tried, I think he got a cortisone shot and said, I'm just going to try to fight on. And then he wound up getting shoulder surgery and then from then on after Rehab looks fantastic. That's really interesting though, the concept of could you, could you push through a class action lawsuit with an athlete who is in that position? I mean, yeah. Where does that go? I mean then if you're playing hurt, I mean, you're in the NFL and you're playing hurt. Right, right. Um, do you have any obligation? No. I mean, I mean it's interesting. Well, UFC fighters fight hurt all the time. I know for a fact guys fight with blown out hcls and torn hamstrings and they just listen.

Speaker 1:          02:12:41       They get to that point, they think I can still win. And some of them still went, Kamara will lose Monde, won the title with a broken foot. He broke his foot in training and he, he was literally on crutches the week of the fight and then the guy gets to the fight and he's such a fucking animal and so tough that he fought. Like there was nothing wrong with him. And then afterwards revealed that he had broken his foot. It's fucking bananas. The mental toughness that you have to have to be able to do that for a living and then you, you, and when you lose to somebody with a broken foot. Yeah. That's, and yeah, yeah, yeah. It was, yeah. Dominated, dominated Tyron Woodley, which is even crazier, but then Woodley wins that fight injured as well. I mean, it's just the nature of the beast. If your job is to hurt people and break their bodies, you're going to have to practice breaking bodies along the way and you're going to have to practice it with people that are trying to break your body occasionally that they

Speaker 3:          02:13:31       succeed. Yeah. Yeah. Rough business. Yeah. You got to come, come to an event. I actually, I would like to do that. I just want an Anaheim in a couple of weeks. You should come to that one. It's a big one. Daniel Cormier is fighting steep Emile church. Okay. For the heavyweight title in a couple of weeks. Yup. Nate Diaz is fighting, uh, Anthony Pettis. That's a crazy fight. And Paulo Kosta is fighting UL Romero. The two or three rather epic fights in rain and Anaheim. Graying. No one gets injured. [inaudible] Jesus. Uh, yeah. You know what? I can bring scooter. Scooter likes rings. Yeah. He likes that. Come on down man. Yeah, set it up. You know what? I'll follow up on that. I will do. All right and tell me when your show comes out so I could let the, let the people know. Maybe you can come back on again when, whenever it actually, if you wouldn't mind once they give me the go ahead because apparently I'm prescribed, I'm talking about it, but when they give me the go ahead, you won't be able to just shut up. Alright. Just keep talking. Well thank you Joe. We'll do that. Thank you sir. Thank you man. Good Times. All right. Bye Buddy.

Speaker 6:          02:14:26       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:14:30       Fun Time Style, man. Yeah. Thank you, man.
