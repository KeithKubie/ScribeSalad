00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Welcome to Unit 5. Today we talk about actual robot motion.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
In the previous unit we talked about how to find paths .

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Now we'll talk about how to turn these paths into actual motion commands.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
In particular, we'll talk about generating smooth paths.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Then we'll talk about control.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
In particular, a method called PID control.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
As usual, you get a chance to program all these wonderful things.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
You might be remember that our planning took place in a discrete world,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and the type of plans we found look very much like this,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
perhaps in response to obstacles over here.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Now, a path like this has lots of disadvantages.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
You don't want to a robot to go straight, take a 90-degree turn and go straight again.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
For one, a car can't even do this, but for another this will force the robot to move

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
really slowly around the corner over here.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
A much better path would look like this.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
This is a smoother path.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
In the extreme case, you might even generate a path just like this.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The question becomes can we modify the blue path to look more like the red or the green path?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Suppose your car like a robot right over here wished to get to right over here.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Which path would you prefer?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
The blue path, the red one, or the green one?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Just check one of the three.

00:01:31.000 --> 09:59:59.000
This is a question where I check your intuition. This is not a mathematically precise question.
