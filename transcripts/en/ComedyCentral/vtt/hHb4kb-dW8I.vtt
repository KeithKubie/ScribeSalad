- HE JUST SEEMS REALLY DISTANT,
AND HE'S ALWAYS ON THE PHONE

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:11.011 line:0%
 
WITH SOMEONE OR MAKING PLANS.

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:15.282
HE CHANGED HIS EMAIL PASSWORD,
WHICH SEEMS REALLY SUSPICIOUS.

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:19.786
I CALLED BOBBY,
AND I ASKED HIM TO HELP ME OUT.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.189
- I'M ROBERT BRUSCHA,
AKA BOBBY BOTTLESERVICE,

00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:25.125
AKA BOBBY BOTTLESERVICE.

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:26.994
I WILL MAKE SURE
THAT YOU ARE PROTECTED,

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:28.729
WHATEVER HAPPENS HERE, OKAY?

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:31.899
I TREAT WOMEN WITH RESPECT,
BECAUSE, NO DISRESPECT,

00:00:31.932 --> 00:00:34.801
THERE'S NOTHING MORE BEAUTIFUL
THAN A WOMAN IN NEED.

00:00:34.835 --> 00:00:36.737
BECAUSE MY MOTHER
RAISED ME RIGHT.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.841
AND WHEN MY FATHER CHEATED--

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:45.312
WHEN MY FATHER CHEAT--

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:47.648
I REPLAYED IT IN MY HEAD
OVER AND OVER.

00:00:47.681 --> 00:00:50.284
[muttering angrily]

00:00:50.317 --> 00:00:53.320
- THANK YOU.
- OKAY.

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:55.389
- OKAY.
- GOD, YOU SMELL AMAZING.

00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:57.057
- THANKS, BOBBY.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.825
- DID YOU EAT AN ORANGE
BEFORE THIS?

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.761
- I JUST TO FIND OUT
WHAT'S GOING ON.

00:01:00.794 --> 00:01:04.231
I MEAN, I'VE BEEN GETTING SICK
OVER IT BECAUSE I--

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:06.166
- OKAY, SHUT UP.
I JUST GOT A TEXT MESSAGE.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.969
IT'S FROM PETER PAPARAZZO.
THE DEAL'S GOING DOWN.

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:11.672
WHAT'S UP, BUSINESS ASSOCIATE?
- YO, BRO, CHECK IT.

00:01:11.705 --> 00:01:13.941
CHEATER, CHEATER, CHEATER,
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

00:01:13.974 --> 00:01:15.475
- IT'S TIME TO BUST
SOME SKULLS, 'KAY.

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.677
- LET'S KILL IT.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.746
- YEAH, BRO.
OKAY, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE NOW?

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.582
ARE YOU CHEATIN'?
- NO, IT'S A BUSINESS COLLEAGUE.

00:01:21.615 --> 00:01:24.384
- WORD UP, DUDE. NICE.
- GOOD STUFF, BRO.

00:01:24.418 --> 00:01:26.587
- I'M LOST.
- YOU'RE ON THE SHOW <i>CHEATIN'.</i>

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:27.721
- YOU'RE CHEATING.
- YEAH.

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:29.389
- NICE JOB.
- SO IT'S A GOOD THING?

00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:30.991
- YEAH, BRO.
- EVERYBODY DOES THIS, MAN.

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:33.193
JFK, NEWT GINGRICH, SHAGGY.

00:01:33.227 --> 00:01:35.229
- EVERYBODY.
- THAT'S SMART.

00:01:35.262 --> 00:01:37.364
- MAYBE WE'LL DO SOME SHOTS
TO BRING HOME.

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:38.498
PROM PICTURES.
- YEAH.

00:01:38.532 --> 00:01:39.833
- ALL RIGHT,
HOW ABOUT SOME PICTURES?

00:01:39.867 --> 00:01:41.502
- SAY "LANCE ARMSTRONG."

00:01:41.535 --> 00:01:43.570
- LANCE ARMSTRONG.
- YEAH.

00:01:43.604 --> 00:01:45.339
- SAY HI TO YOUR WIFE.
- HI, HONEY.

00:01:45.372 --> 00:01:47.674
- DOES ANYONE HAVE AN EXTRA
JACKET OR ANYTHING?

00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:50.110
IT'S KIND OF COLD OUT HERE.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.913
- I GOT TO BREAK IT DOWN, BRO.
HOW DO YOU DO IT?

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:54.448
WHAT'S THE SECRET?

00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:56.717
- I APPRECIATE YOU ASKING
BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE DON'T

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.585
RESPECT IT QUITE AS MUCH
AS YOU DO.

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.455
THE LEG WORK IS EXHAUSTING.
- YEAH.

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:04.057
- I HAVE TWO NAMES...LEGALLY.
- REALLY?

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:05.559
WHAT DO YOU GO BY?
STEVE AND TIM.

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:07.394
- STEVE AND TIM. I ALTERNATE.
- OKAY.

00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:08.629
DO YOU BUY HER NICE STUFF,

00:02:08.662 --> 00:02:10.831
OR ARE YOU JUST, LIKE,
"FLIP OVER, WEIRDO?"

00:02:10.864 --> 00:02:13.066
- I'VE NEVER SAID, "FLIP OVER,
WEIRDO," TO ANYONE.

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:15.135
- SURE.
NOW, DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:16.403
THAT WOULD MAKE THIS
MORE TERRIBLE?

00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:17.771
- NOT THAT I ACKNOWLEDGE.

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:18.772
- OOH.

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:20.741
- WHO IS THIS BITCH, HUH?

00:02:20.774 --> 00:02:22.910
IS THIS THE BITCH THAT YOU'RE
CHEATING ON ME WITH?

00:02:22.943 --> 00:02:25.279
- NO, THIS IS MY GIRLFRIEND
WHO I'M WITH.

00:02:25.312 --> 00:02:27.080

- STOP TALKING.
YOU DON'T SPEAK EITHER.

00:02:32.786 --> 00:02:35.989
YOU...SPEAK.

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:38.725
- SHE'S VERY MUCH IDENTIFIED
THE WEAK LINK HERE.

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:43.263
- I'M GAY.

00:02:43.297 --> 00:02:45.933
- LET'S SIT DOWN.
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS, OKAY?

00:02:45.966 --> 00:02:47.234

00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:48.335
- NO.

00:02:48.368 --> 00:02:50.103
- LET ME EXPLAIN
WHAT'S OCCURRED HERE.

00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:52.639
THIS GUY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
WRONG, OKAY?

00:02:52.673 --> 00:02:56.276
I'M DATING VICKY,
VERY MUCH SERIOUSLY.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.346
BUT I ALSO HAVE
ANOTHER LADY, OKAY?

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:03.584
I'M THE CHEATER.
TIM HERE, AKA STEVE--

00:03:03.617 --> 00:03:04.952
- I GO BY BOTH.

00:03:05.052 --> 00:03:08.455
- THIS GUY'S A GODDAMN
CHIVALROUS FRIEND OF MINE

00:03:08.488 --> 00:03:12.326
WHO STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE WHEN
I NEEDED HIM MOST SO THAT I CAN

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.262
HAVE UNPROTECTED SEX
WITH THIS FOREIGN PERSON.

00:03:15.295 --> 00:03:17.164
LET'S GO OUTSIDE AND DO ORAL,

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:18.765
AND I'LL FEEL VERY MUCH GUILTY
ABOUT IT.

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.334
- YES, BABY, LET'S GO.
- OKAY.

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:24.271
- COME ON.
LET'S GO.
