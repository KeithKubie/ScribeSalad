00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.440
Hello, everyone and welcome
to the environment forum

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.330
at the Mahindra
Humanities Center.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.440
I'm Ian Miller, co-convener
of the forum with Robin Kelce,

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.500
a professor of photography and
Dean of Arts and Humanities

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.900
here at Harvard.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.282
This is the final event
of ours for the semester.

00:00:23.282 --> 00:00:25.740
We'll continue in the spring
with a set of exciting events,

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.466
always exciting events
here at the forum,

00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:28.840
but these are
particularly great.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.490
I'm excited to welcome these
two scholars to campus.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.820
The first is a discussion with
a historian of science Deborah

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.230
Cohen from Yale, recently
moved from Barnard, on the uses

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.010
and abuses of historical
thinking in the climate change

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.480
debate and in the manufacture
of climate knowledge.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.050
And then second, we'll
have a very welcome visit

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.690
from a familiar figure
here at Harvard,

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.790
the eminent
psychiatrist Robert J.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.270
Lifton, who has turned
his gaze from the causes

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.120
and costs of conflict
and violence issues

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.700
that he's been dealing with
since he was involved in the US

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.300
occupation of Japan in
the immediate aftermath

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.740
of the Second World War, to
questions of climate change

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.630
and environmental damage.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.930
It promises to be a terrific
lineup for the spring.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.090
And it would not be
possible, I have to say,

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.810
I'm very happy to say,
without the unwavering support

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.890
of the Mahindra Center.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.340
I'd like to begin by thanking
Homi Bhabha, director

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.060
of the center, Steve
Beale, and Sarah Raiser,

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.700
as well as the full
staff at the center.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.470
You make all of this possible.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.180
You bring all of us together.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.250
And it's somehow invisible,
because you do it

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.020
so well each and every time.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.215
Thank you very much.

00:01:47.215 --> 00:01:49.340
I'm also grateful to all
of you for joining us here

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.881
at the forum.

00:01:49.881 --> 00:01:52.460
I'm absolutely delighted
with the turnout.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.650
I thought it's
raining, the climate

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.366
has impacted our
talk about climate.

00:01:57.366 --> 00:01:58.490
No one is going to show up.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.620
And here we are, almost
overflowing the room.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.400
It's just perfect.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.060
Thank you for joining us on
a cold, rainy night for what

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.000
promises to be a warm
and engaging talk.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.260
I'm also grateful
to, or I'd like--

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.420
I'm pleased to introduce
tonight's, excuse me,

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.600
to introduce our
work in this series

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.740
as well as to welcome Professor
Michael Puett, who will join us

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.850
for the Q&amp;A following the talk.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.310
It was kindly agreed to
introduce tonight's speaker,

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.280
Prasenjit Duara.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.260
Prasenjit joins us from
Duke, and he's here

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.330
to talk about issues
related to his most

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.480
recent book, The Crisis
of Global Modernity, Asian

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.560
Traditions.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.240
And I have to
shill for the book,

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.590
because it's a wonderful book.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.100
Pick it up.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.040
It's incredibly provocative,
and a great read.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.430
The Crisis of Global
Modernity, Asian Traditions

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.410
and a Sustainable Future.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.190
Now, to my eye, the purpose
of the forum is fairly simple.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.010
It's not all that complicated.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.720
Our work is, at
the end of the day,

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.970
an effort to situate
the humanities

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.530
and the social sciences
in the natural world.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.220
I emphasize the
proposition because it's

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.550
meant to carry a double
meaning in this case,

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.890
signaling both the immersion--

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.480
thank you, I saw
that that moved.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.800
Signaling both the
immersion of our work

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.770
as humans into an
encompassing material world,

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.320
a kind of ecological
embeddedness that is sometimes

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.880
lost in our focus on the
realm of ideas and texts.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.030
And second, the
recognition that work

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.150
in these fields from the
arts and fiction making

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.120
to history and the
social sciences

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.690
offers crucial
resources as we struggle

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.860
to come to terms with the
reality of our changing

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.310
climate and our changing world.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.896
Now, it seems that
lately many of us

00:03:56.896 --> 00:03:58.520
want to see the first
of these meanings

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.980
as more radical, more
interesting, more cutting edge.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.910
Frankly, to use the term that
my graduate advisor used to use,

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.820
sexier intellectually, right?

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.950
The material turn, and
the new materialism

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.600
seem to be everywhere
these days.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.590
These days, ubiquitous
phrases used

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.800
in ways that signal a
sea change in how we are

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.880
trying to think as scholars.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.660
I sit on the board for a
nationally competitive graduate

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:24.950
fellowship down in New York.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:25.909
I go down every year.

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:28.450
And it's a signal of the kind
of durability and applicability

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.290
and kind of trendiness
of this term,

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.710
it turns out that
something like 60%

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.930
of the finalist applications
for the fellowship last year

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.870
used the term entanglement.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.480
Meant to use-- signal
this embeddedness,

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.010
this material term.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.900
It's become the new
buzzword of our age,

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.940
it seems like, the way
discourse was when I was

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.950
a grad student in the 1980s.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.480
We all read
Foucault, we were all

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.950
engaged in the cultural turn.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.030
Now, we're turning back to
the material world, it seems.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.490
It's everywhere in
humanistic discourse.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.500
We can see them and
see that in fairly

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.690
theoretical or philosophical
ways, and a growing

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.050
body of work, critical work
in particular, on ontology,

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.210
the so-called ontological turn.

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:09.980
And in a renewed
sense of urgency

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.570
around more
traditional questions,

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.660
such as agency, now
distributed in a way

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.810
it was not in our
writing space and place,

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.600
in a richer ecological sense.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.330
In more immediate
and apparent efforts,

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:29.830
it's there in such efforts
as our work on book history

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.040
here at Harvard, practiced by
Anne Blair, Bob Darnton, Leah

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.480
Price, and others
here on campus.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.240
Scholarly work has
never been immaterial,

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.170
these folks remind us, not in
the ways we like to pretend.

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:44.720
They show us that
the history of ideas

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.670
is also a history of technology.

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.580
In this case, one
especially useful, portable,

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.380
and durable technology.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:52.770
The book.

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:53.940
We see it everywhere.

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.420
And we see op eds
now in the Atlantic,

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.970
the Washington Post, the
New York Times telling us it

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.210
won't go away.

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.690
Now, lately I sometimes
think that the second aspect

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.080
of our mission, the
more commonplace aspect,

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.150
is more challenging.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:11.780
The material turn is underway.

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.870
It has momentum, as
is evident in the work

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.370
of those brilliant
graduate students

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.400
who are cranking out grant
applications every fall.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.870
We see it in our
work, we hear it

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:23.500
in the questions that come from
our students in our classrooms.

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.490
But what about the uses of
the humanistic tradition?

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.710
As we struggle to come to
terms with our changing

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:33.070
global climate, how can
the deep traditions, and I

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.500
use that word advisedly
and technically,

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.940
the deep traditions, legacies,
histories and cultures

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.900
enshrined in literate
canons from around the world

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.840
help us to understand and act
in this particular moment?

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.840
How our history in the
deep past, useful today.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.670
How can we write, as Homi said
in his eloquent introduction

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:58.480
to our forum hosting
Naomi Oreskes,

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.960
how can we learn to write
in the first person,

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.180
in specific and
personally meaningful

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.150
ways about forces
that so far exceed

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:11.290
our individual capacity
for representation or even

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:12.940
comprehension?

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:17.050
Forces and dynamics such
as global climate change.

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:20.200
What is the role of the
humanities and scholars

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.730
who practice the humanities
in such a moment?

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:29.150
Few places, perhaps no
place, offers a greater depth

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:33.230
of intellectual resources,
defined here as millennia,

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:37.260
of literate culture with which
to confront these questions

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:43.400
than China and East Asia, the
locus of this evening's forum.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.130
And it's difficult to imagine
two scholars who are better

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:50.150
suited to usher us into
that deep past than Michael

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:53.120
Puett and Prasenjit Duara.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.110
Michael will introduce Professor
Duara and this evening's talk,

00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:01.490
but I'm absolutely delighted
to be able to introduce him

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:03.470
this evening.

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:06.050
Michael is Walter C. Climb,
professor of Chinese history

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:09.410
and anthropology here at
Harvard, and the author,

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:14.090
co-author, editor, and co-editor
of four extremely well-received

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:17.210
books, with another
quickly on the way.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:19.130
But he's probably
best known at Harvard

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:22.520
as simply one of the best
teachers this school has ever

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.780
seen.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:26.840
Michael is a genius
in the classroom.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.440
If you haven't watched him
teach, sneak into the back

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.460
of his lectures.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:34.130
They are fabulous,
and they're electric.

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:36.559
And the reason is
sitting right here.

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:39.980
This is a professor who asks
his students, asks all of us

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:43.309
really, if you read his work,
to live as the sages did,

00:08:43.309 --> 00:08:46.970
to put philosophy into
practice, to see how it applies,

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:50.300
to understand his contradictions
as you think about the choices

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.270
and values of your
everyday life.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:55.520
His intellectual
work in that sense

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.200
defines that aspect
of the forums mission.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.710
That is, to summon the
deep past, in this case

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:05.470
the Chinese past,
the Asian past,

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:07.900
into the service of
the present, using

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:11.140
it to defamiliarize our
world, and to make new ways

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.630
of being visible and viable.

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:15.700
Please join me in
welcoming Michael,

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.250
and welcome to the forum.

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.100
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.420
Thank you, thank you.

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:24.850
Thank you so much, Ian, for
the much nice introduction.

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:27.097
My deep thanks to you
and Professor Kelce

00:09:27.097 --> 00:09:28.180
for putting this together.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:30.050
This is such an
extraordinary forum.

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:31.980
And it's a deep
honor for me today

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:35.550
to introduce Professor Prasenjit
Duara, the first time this year

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:38.730
in the session that we'll be
bringing in voices from Asia.

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:41.700
And as we will see, with a voice
that will enable us to do so

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.530
in truly extraordinary ways.

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:46.710
Professor Duara has been
for years one of the leading

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:48.630
figures, not simply
in helping us

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.670
have a new
understanding of Asia,

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.920
but much more
importantly allowing

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:56.640
us to use the materials, the
indigenous concepts in Asia

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.010
to rethink our most fundamental
assumptions, our most

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:00.390
fundamental approaches.

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:02.220
And we think, what
we used to think

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.350
of as the big
questions, now posed

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:06.120
in radically different ways.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.590
Prasenjit Duara first
broke onto the scene

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:09.880
in-- with his first book.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.270
It was called Culture
Power in the State.

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:16.260
It was an attempt to rethink
state formation in China

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.480
in the first half
of the 20th century.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.120
But the way he does this
is not the way everyone

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.840
else was doing it,
which is, of course,

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.840
to look at how states operate.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.390
He actually begins
at the rural level,

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:29.700
shows over the
course of 50 years

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.870
the radical transformation
in the rural areas

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:34.440
effected by the state.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.640
And thereby makes an argument
how we should understand

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.110
new state formation in China.

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:42.180
But he makes it very
clear, this should

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:44.220
lead us to rethink
state formation in Asia

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:47.910
in general, and state formation
throughout the entire world.

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:50.340
In the subsequent decades
since the book was published,

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:52.740
this has become one
of the key works

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:56.370
in allowing us to rethink these
processes of state formation.

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:59.340
Immediately, he moves
on to yet another work.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:02.700
This one is called Rescuing
History From the Nation.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:06.240
Arguing that yes, most
of our historiographies

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:10.100
are dominated by accepted
notions of the nation state,

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:11.850
and many people at the
time were saying we

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:14.520
should work against this
and deconstruct our notions

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.810
of the nation state.

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:19.140
Prasenjit Duara was the leader
in saying absolutely true.

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.610
But then what do we do next?

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:24.180
And the book was an
attempt to actively rethink

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:27.240
what history would mean if
we did not take the nation

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.340
state as the central focus.

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:31.830
Hereto, we have an
extraordinarily influential

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:34.740
work that has really
helped us we conceptualize

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:36.450
the practice of history.

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:39.930
Following was his third book,
Sovereignty and Authenticity,

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:42.540
an attempt to rethink our
notions of sovereignty,

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.890
the nation state in Asia.

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:47.500
But again, forcing it onto
an international level,

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.440
and here again
forcing a fundamental

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.540
rethinking of our assumptions.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:54.090
And most importantly,
his latest book,

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:57.300
The Crisis of Global Modernity,
our discussion for tonight.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:00.120
A truly extraordinary
work, in which

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.790
he forces a complete
rethinking not

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:04.920
only of the rise of
modernity, which is not

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.710
a minor topic in
itself, but even

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:12.000
arguing that not just we need
to re-conceptualize modernity,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.060
but how would we redo
history so we don't fall

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:17.970
into the dangers of assuming
a modernity narrative even as

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:19.380
were trying to deny it.

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.570
He comes up with
a brilliant vision

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:24.600
of history of
circulation, then rereads

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:28.680
the entire so-called modern
period through such a history.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.980
As he goes, he rethinks
our fundamental assumptions

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:34.080
about what secularized
states are,

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.850
as they arose
during this period.

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:39.030
Rethinking why they arose,
what they were really doing,

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:40.890
what they were working against.

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:42.750
And then perhaps
most brilliantly

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:47.250
of all, shows how discrete
conceptualisation forces us,

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:49.590
or I should even
say inspires us,

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:53.160
to rethink our notions of
the circulation of religions

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.660
that are ongoing.

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:57.450
All of which is then used
to make a strong, and I

00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:01.410
found incredibly powerful and
moving, argument for how we can

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:04.650
we conceptualize the
ecological crisis precisely

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:07.830
by rethinking our most
fundamental assumptions,

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:10.560
our most fundamental
approaches, and making

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:14.010
a sophisticated and brilliant
argument for therefore

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:16.320
what we in the
humanities need to do

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.970
to take part in that effort.

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:21.810
We are therefore honored to have
Prasenjit Duara today to bring

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:23.880
this brilliance
to us as we're all

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.710
trying to wrestle
with these questions.

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:27.300
And I therefore
ask you to join me

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:30.161
in giving our very warmest
welcome to Professor Prasenjit

00:13:30.161 --> 00:13:30.660
Duara.

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:33.055
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:34.013 --> 00:13:35.429
It wasn't that bad, was it?

00:13:35.429 --> 00:13:35.929
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:35.929 --> 00:13:38.340
It wasn't that bad.

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:41.890
may as well just
listen to Michael.

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:46.020
I mean, I couldn't
recognize myself there.

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:49.020
But that was fabulous,
thank you very much.

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:50.860
[INAUDIBLE]

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.500
I'm very much humbled now.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:58.420
So please, scale down
your expectations.

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:02.820
I'm very pleased, at any
rate, to see all of you here.

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:05.490
Every time I've come to
Harvard over the last god

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:08.230
knows how many years,
it's been raining,

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:09.870
but people still show up.

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:17.370
I don't get rained
out at any rate.

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:19.200
Now, let's see.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:26.010
We-- I'm going to extricate
some sacrifices from you,

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:28.500
because you've taken
15 minutes of my time.

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.451
And it's a rather
long, long talk.

00:14:31.451 --> 00:14:31.950
So So--

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:32.460
Good.

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:34.550
--give me -- good, he says.

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:35.760
OK.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:40.240
So, yeah, let's see.

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.320
This way, right?

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:43.556
Has it moved?

00:14:43.556 --> 00:14:44.180
It should have.

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:45.440
Yeah, OK.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:50.870
So the talk is based on the
book, which you've heard about,

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:53.240
and which I will plug
again at the end.

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.200
Although it's not new anymore.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:01.320
But there's the crisis
of global modernity.

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:06.560
But it also deals with
some of my recent work

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:12.530
that I'm working mostly with
Cambodian activists and so on.

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:16.710
And also working
with my good friends,

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:19.010
Mary Evelyn Tucker
and John Green,

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:21.560
who I'm very pleased
to say are here.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:25.370
I was just at Yale last
week or the week before,

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:31.040
where we were discussing sort
of the methodology of trying

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.650
to develop a
methodology and agenda

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:36.620
of environmental
humanities, particularly

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.480
from the Asian context.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.120
Although that will
not be the talk here,

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:44.630
given what the pre-talks that
I've had with several of you,

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:48.800
maybe in the discussion
we can talk about that.

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.780
So, what is the problem?

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:52.190
Can I read this?

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:53.150
OK.

00:15:53.150 --> 00:16:00.860
So what as-- as Michael sort
of pointed out very, very well,

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:07.010
much of the problem has awoken
to the climate change issue

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:07.940
recently.

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:10.790
And I think environmental
humanities is of course

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:14.810
a reactionary response to that.

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:16.800
Can I get a kind of
a full screen here?

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:22.710
How do I do that?

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:25.290
Can somebody help me?

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:28.140
Because it's half, and
my eyes are not as good

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:31.865
as they used to be.

00:16:31.865 --> 00:16:35.880
Is there-- no, I mean,
here the screen itself,

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:38.610
this laptop is divided into two.

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:42.420
With my future slide,
which I don't need.

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:43.790
Oh, it's In presenter view.

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:47.470
It's in presenter view, so it
should be in display settings.

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:48.830
Of course, I'm a Mac user.

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:50.686
So I'm a little useless.

00:16:50.686 --> 00:16:51.614
[INAUDIBLE]

00:16:51.614 --> 00:16:53.033
Great, thank you.

00:16:53.033 --> 00:16:53.940
You just want your--

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:55.240
I just want my screen.

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.350
No problem at all, sir.

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:57.500
Yeah, I thought
it would be that.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:58.440
[INAUDIBLE] technology.

00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:59.520
But I didn't want to mess--

00:16:59.520 --> 00:16:59.880
thank you.

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:00.168
There you go.

00:17:00.168 --> 00:17:00.360
No problem.

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.230
Sorry about that.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.980
So the humanities have
sort of responded to it,

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:11.369
and we know that
the crisis is, well,

00:17:11.369 --> 00:17:15.420
according to most
scientists in the world,

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:18.030
it's really a product
of the overreach,

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:20.700
of human overreach,
of the modern goal

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:24.359
of generating wealth by
conquering nature, if one

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:27.089
can make a bold
statement like that.

00:17:27.089 --> 00:17:31.380
Even so, many policy
makers look to--

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:33.030
they look, of
course, to renewable

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:35.670
energy, which is the one
that is most important.

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:38.970
That is to say, most
policymakers in much

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:40.020
of the rest of the world.

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:46.860
But also look to geoengineering
and market mechanisms

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:48.690
to address these problems.

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:50.820
Now, to begin with,
I'm not opposed.

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.200
I'm certainly not sympathetic.

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.720
I think we need
all that we can get

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:59.080
to address the problems of
climate change that we have.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:03.510
But I think that geoengineering
and market solutions, market

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:07.080
mechanisms, are really--

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.950
have many, many side
problems, including

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:15.770
the issues of delivery, of
governance, of many plans

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:19.140
sort of sit-in the drawers
of scientists desks

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.420
or in the files, I guess.

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:24.000
And because of
problems of governance,

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.130
of cultural
understanding, of society,

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:30.330
and most of all, of course,
of political ecology,

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:33.090
and the politics of
these kinds of issues.

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:36.720
And of course many also
geoengineering solutions

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:39.360
can have all kinds of
disastrous side effects

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:43.590
that require once again
civil society, and what

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:48.430
is now known as citizen
science, to be able to address.

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:51.550
So renewable energy
is, of course, great.

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:53.730
But I don't think
that it can still

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:56.580
alleviate our current rate
of accelerating climate

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:59.760
change and rising ocean levels.

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:03.540
I follow closely the economic--

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:07.590
the ecological
economist Tim Jackson,

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:09.810
who has a treadmill argument.

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:15.810
He is the director of
the sustainable economy

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:21.120
program in the UK, and is very
involved with the UN as well.

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:27.990
And Tim Jackson argues from kind
of a semi-Marxist perspective

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:32.910
that as long as we remain on
the treadmill of accelerating

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:38.520
production, the reduction
of polluting energy inputs

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:44.100
will simply increase its use for
higher production and profits.

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:47.670
And at the same time,
increase the exploitation

00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:50.100
of other resources.

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:54.180
I think one of the best
examples in recent times

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:59.070
is the rarer quest, which
is really digging very

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:02.460
deep in many parts of the
world, and also producing,

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:03.960
of course, abysmal conditions.

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.390
But it's necessary for
your and my cell phones

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:09.150
and for everything
else that we're doing

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:11.940
with contemporary technology.

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:14.730
So ultimately, it
seems to me that we

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:17.400
will need a kind of value
change in the world that

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:20.910
can limit the mentality
of increasing GDP

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:23.640
and consumption, that treadmill.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.350
At the same time,
of course, we need

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:27.960
to address the
problem of poverty.

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:30.660
Because after all, we cannot
stand up when the third world

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:33.930
stands up and says OK,
you've had your goods.

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:35.790
What about us?

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:39.630
And so I think any notion
of environmental justice

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:44.670
has to build that in a way that
the Paris climate conference

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:48.540
did not necessarily address.

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:51.000
Ecologists and people
like Tim Jackson

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.900
have tried valiantly to show
that the tools-- the problem

00:20:54.900 --> 00:21:00.240
of alleviation of poverty, and
the alleviation or at least

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:04.500
addressing mitigation
of climate change

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:09.090
are not necessarily
contradictory, particularly

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:11.460
if we are committed--
if we do not

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:16.110
remain committed to incessant
GDP growth as the only measure

00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:17.740
of prosperity.

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:20.340
And they consider
many different-- how

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:23.130
it is that our very
notion of prosperity

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:26.790
has become reduced to
this kind of GDP growth.

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:28.620
And it's only measured
in those kinds

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:30.450
of terms, which
of course in turn

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:38.410
involves increasing consumption
at a rapid rate and so on.

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:41.520
And he talks about--

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:45.420
he considers [INAUDIBLE],, who
is still at this university,

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:45.920
right?

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:46.280
Yes.

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:46.779
OK, good.

00:21:46.779 --> 00:21:48.940
I could never figure
out where he is.

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:51.810
That's a good point,
but [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:53.610
capabilities ideas,
which I think

00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:55.230
are also very interesting.

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:57.240
But of course, he has to--

00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:01.020
he has to, what should
I say, adapt them

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:04.920
to the conditions
of what it means

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:09.000
to have a fulfilling life
without necessarily going on

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.640
by increasing capabilities.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:17.190
But not having sort of access to
the full resources of the world

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:21.450
all the time, that is with
limited thresholds, right?

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:25.320
And one of the things
that Tim Jackson argues

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:30.440
is that as long as we can--

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:33.720
he says that you can
have a satisfactory life

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:38.820
to fulfill all kinds
of purposes with a,

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:45.490
what he calculates, a $15,000
per capita income in the world.

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:49.260
And if the world could
maintain it at that level,

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:51.330
you could find
many different ways

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:56.520
of achieving your
capacities and capabilities,

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.740
and fulfilling your
desires for many things.

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:02.010
It almost sounds like when
Marx talks about go fishing

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:04.320
in the morning and hunting
in the evening and things

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.560
like that in his communist
utopia, but with the Marx--

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:11.370
but you may have to
do fishing, and not

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:14.295
go on with your latest gadget.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.580
Fly fishing, perhaps.

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:23.280
So my work is really--

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:26.970
now, the paper is designed to
probe this problem of value

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:30.810
change and adjust to--

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:33.210
I don't know anything
about Costa Rica

00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:34.950
except what I've given you.

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:37.650
I was giving a class
lecture, and I was--

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:39.840
I stumbled onto it.

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:42.524
And it seems to me
the perfect example.

00:23:42.524 --> 00:23:44.190
And I'm sure that if
you will-- if there

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:47.010
are Latin Americans you
will correct me, and show me

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:49.840
how many problems there
are in Costa Rica.

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:53.370
But they have a per
capita GDP of $12,000

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:57.810
USD they have 5% of the
world's biodiversity,

00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:02.850
but the population is 0.06% of
the world's population, right?

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:05.460
They have 25% of their
land is protected,

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:07.640
as you can see in this map here.

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:09.930
And 50% of the land is forested.

00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:12.450
It's not-- a lot of it
is new growth forest.

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:14.100
It's not primeval
forests or something.

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:16.320
But nonetheless, they have it.

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.080
And the happiness planet--

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:23.740
happy planet index
discovered it to be--

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:27.780
rated it as the greenest and
happiest country for three

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:29.680
years in a row in the world.

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:32.910
It has displaced
Bhutan by far, and also

00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:36.135
many of the Scandinavian
countries in those indices.

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:40.880
And it's not just
the happiness panel.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.620
Gallup poll also found the
Central American nation

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:46.290
to have the highest level
of well-being in the world.

00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:51.000
So it's not-- it's not some
pie-in-the-sky goal that these

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.140
guys are talking about.

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:55.800
I think a lot has to
be done, but there

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.870
is-- it's in the
realm of possibility.

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.050
So what is my argument?

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:08.140
I argue that we begin to
see the glimmers of value

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:12.010
change in a convergence
of historical trends

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:16.060
of marginal, local communities
in Asia and elsewhere

00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:19.450
in the developing world seeking
to conserve their livelihood

00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:25.120
resources, and coming together
with modern groups committed

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:28.630
to environmental
protection, right?

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:31.810
This convergence, I argue, is
a kind of emergent phenomenon,

00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:36.850
in the fashionable sense of
the word emergent of Whitehead

00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:39.780
and others.

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:42.160
But it is of course
a very weak force.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:44.530
But it is poised, I think,
on something very globally

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:45.910
significant.

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:50.470
They reflect a kind of
philosophical attitude that--

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:53.110
and the possibilities
of a sustainable life

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:57.910
in opposition to the
neo-liberal model that we have,

00:25:57.910 --> 00:26:00.490
that we have lived with now,
the neo-liberal capitalist,

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:04.870
or even, what I would say,
the national modernization

00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:08.200
cosmology focused on
the conquest of nature,

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.650
and to feed unending wealth.

00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:13.630
As I said, it's a weak position.

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:16.360
There are lots of
weaknesses within

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:18.970
this oppositional mosaic,
and we can talk about them.

00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:22.360
I'm not going to dwell on the
weaknesses so much this time.

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:24.310
I'll mention them.

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:31.150
But my goal is really to try and
see what this kind of position

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:32.680
is, what kind of--

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:37.660
is it possible to sort
of track it, to trace it,

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:41.410
and to view it from world
historical patterns that are

00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:45.370
tied to ideas of transcendence.

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:47.920
And my final
argument is that I do

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:51.580
believe there is a concept,
a new concept of sick reality

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:54.850
of nature that is
beginning to emerge,

00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:58.720
and that it has social
discursive as well

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:01.660
as some legal
underpinnings globally.

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:03.910
But you just have to
have the right optic

00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:05.170
to see how it's working.

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:10.660
So I really want
to draw attention

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:13.420
to this possibility
in the world.

00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:18.220
So I go into some
depth about some

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:20.340
of the theoretical
concepts in the book

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:22.420
and that have been
very important for me

00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:25.150
to understand this phenomenon.

00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:28.090
I use very much,
or a version of,

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:30.940
it's not the orthodox
idea of transcendence

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:33.940
that Axial Age
sociologists develop,

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:37.600
including our teacher
Ben Schwartz was

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.190
a very important part of this.

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:42.280
In fact, I first heard
about it from him.

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:46.150
But I have followed the
literature on transcendence.

00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:50.770
I see it not in the traditional
terms of a god or something

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:53.990
like that, but really a
position of knowledge,

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:57.040
what I call a meta epistemic
position of knowledge, I mean.

00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:00.860
It is something that people
have with material consequences,

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:04.720
whether or not that transcendent
position is there or not

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:07.210
is not significant to me.

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:10.720
It works as if it is important
for the people who see it,

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.210
right?

00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:15.220
And a lot of philosophers have
now been coming around to it.

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:17.110
Charles Taylor has
become a big advocate.

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:19.900
Even Jurgen Habermas,
who is of course

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:23.050
your ultimate rationalist,
post-Marxist rationalist,

00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:24.950
has come around to
this point of view.

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:28.120
And he, of course, is super
enthusiastic about it.

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:31.570
He talks about this is the
transcendent position, which

00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:33.670
is a position from
outside the world,

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:37.000
really allows you to get a
synoptic view of the world

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.610
as a whole, distinguishing
the flood of phenomena

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:41.326
from underlying essence.

00:28:41.326 --> 00:28:42.700
And then he goes
on about how you

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:46.200
get the difference between
health, and myth, and law.

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:51.050
And it's just I think
he overdoes it, but--

00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:53.980
because it's not entirely that.

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:57.310
But it is very much the
capacity for transcendence.

00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:59.170
If I had to define
it, is the capacity

00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:02.260
of abstraction from the
here and now, right?

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:04.330
So it is the capacity.

00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:07.030
And it emerges, of
course, at the time

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:10.330
when you begin to get
empires in the sixth century

00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:12.700
BC that spread across.

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:14.350
And that's what the axial--

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:17.110
axis-- I'm assuming most of
you are familiar with this,

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:20.980
refers to the Axial Age
across the sixth century

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:25.150
onwards, where you have
philosophers who posit

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:28.840
this meta-epistemic locus.

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:31.840
And it does refer to
the point at which there

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:34.090
is the condition of
Universalism becomes

00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:37.060
possible, something
beyond the here and now.

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:40.960
And it also generates a
reflexivity of the self

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:44.020
and its position in relation
to this world, right?

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:45.850
What is my status?

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:47.920
What is the meaning
of my life in this?

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:49.150
How do I relate to it?

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:51.720
How do I relate to
the world around it?

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:55.720
And how do I relate to power,
to material power in the here

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:56.320
and now?

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:59.860
How does this alternative
source of moral authority,

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:04.120
which is beyond this world,
relate to power in the world?

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:06.790
So it's a source of
ethics and ethical power.

00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:09.160
And this-- this
transcendent role

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:10.990
has been completely
underestimated

00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:14.830
in historical studies.

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:18.070
But if you look at it,
everywhere, it's everywhere.

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:21.220
From the earliest periods,
you begin to get establishment

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:24.640
institutions, whether it's the
church and the church-state

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:28.780
relations, the Mandate
of Heaven, Bauman power .

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:30.760
These are, of course,
become establishment.

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.410
I mean, the whole
idea is that once you

00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:34.930
have a hold on
transcendent power,

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:37.420
then political power wants
to grab that as well, right?

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:38.680
As always.

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.720
But then you also have
oppositional movements

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.870
that are based on
this, whether this is--

00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:45.040
the most important is
the Protestant movement

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.070
that we know about.

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:48.260
But they are all
through history,

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:51.340
whether it's Franciscans, Sufis,
Buddhists against Brahmans,

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:53.470
Buddhist [INAUDIBLE],,
the [INAUDIBLE] movement,

00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:57.730
the Confucian movement, the
Taoists, Thoreau, Gandhi,

00:30:57.730 --> 00:30:58.960
Martin Luther King.

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:02.530
I mean, all these people really
work on this alternative source

00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:05.320
of moral authority, right?

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:07.200
And the problem
with the Axial Age

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:09.670
is that they thought it
happened just once, right?

00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:11.390
But it's a recurrent phenomenon.

00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:14.290
And in that sense, it
becomes a historical process.

00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:17.230
It's very much part
of historical process.

00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:21.400
And it's very important for
renewal, social renewal.

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:24.790
So, and part of the
argument in the book

00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:26.260
is that there is
a big difference

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:29.410
between transcendence in
the Abrahamic societies

00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:31.160
and in the non
Abrahamic societies.

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:34.150
And the book goes on
to discuss a great deal

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:35.000
of this difference.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.750
But I do want to say that
what Max Weber called

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:40.270
the intellectual
religions of the east

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:44.570
did not have an omnipotent god
in that transcendent position,

00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:45.680
right?

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:48.340
But more rational
techniques of cultivation,

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:50.430
whether these are
ethical self cultivation

00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:53.080
is a big term in
Neo-Confucianism,

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:57.370
yogic, meditative in approaching
transcendent authority, rather

00:31:57.370 --> 00:31:59.860
than pure faith or
just secularization.

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:02.080
So there is a measure
of rationality

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:04.750
that we will, of
course, always recognize

00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:07.270
that underlaid the
sacred authority that

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:09.370
was involved in that.

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:11.710
So all the major
problems of the world

00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:14.080
manifest themselves, the
environmental problems

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:17.140
that we have today,
locally and can best

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:21.670
be addressed perhaps locally
without a universal vision

00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:24.250
that the transcendent
position gives us,

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:25.990
that locus can give us.

00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:29.830
It becomes a problem of kicking
the can down the road, right?

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:31.480
It becomes nimby.

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:33.700
We don't want this
chemical factory here,

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:35.020
take it somewhere else.

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:36.020
That doesn't address it.

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:38.140
And this is happening
all over the world.

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:41.380
Today, Thailand is produce--

00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:44.680
it is constructing its
most polluting industries

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:49.537
in the Burmese strip,
which adjoins it.

00:32:49.537 --> 00:32:52.120
That's where it does it, because
there is no movement in Burma

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:54.040
against it in that space.

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:57.301
There is on the Myitsone Dam,
and the Irrawaddy river and so

00:32:57.301 --> 00:32:57.800
on.

00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:59.560
There's huge civil
society movement,

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:00.640
but not in that space.

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.980
And there's nobody
there to complain.

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:05.260
So you-- so what I
argue in the book

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:08.500
is a position of for
dialogical transcendence,

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:10.640
where you can have
this back and forth,

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:12.280
which becomes very
difficult, much

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:14.710
more difficult in the
Abrahamic traditions, which

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:18.730
has a much broader sense
of the transcendent.

00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:22.690
So, one of the
principal problems

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:25.870
in addressing the universal
or planetary dimensions

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:27.400
is of course
nationalism, something

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:31.536
I've railed about for
about 30 years now.

00:33:31.536 --> 00:33:34.270
Though I've become much
more sensible towards it,

00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:37.900
I think, the problem of
national sovereignty,

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:42.460
which prevents collaborative
solving of common problems.

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:45.310
And I'll just show you one
picture of the Himalayan

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:46.630
rivers.

00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:51.460
And it locks national leaders
into this whole competitive GDP

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:54.670
and resource
control game, right?

00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:56.650
So one of the things--
the other thing

00:33:56.650 --> 00:33:58.810
that I try to do in
this book is also

00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:03.340
talk about how the idea
of national sovereignty

00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:06.160
is so closely tied
up with the idea

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:09.580
of modern national history, of
modern history, which of course

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:12.340
began as national histories.

00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:17.889
And that it has the
role, by talking about,

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:24.159
by seeing history as linear
and tunneled from origins

00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:29.530
to destiny, it becomes a means
of claiming sovereignty, right?

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:32.020
This is our people, our land,
our tradition, our culture,

00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:33.380
you get out.

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:35.050
And besides, you
cannot interfere.

00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:41.690
So, it prioritizes
national interest way

00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:44.690
above the planetary
interests, right?

00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:46.760
In a way, the
universal transcendence

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:49.250
of pre-national
religions has been

00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:52.040
blocked at the
nation as the highest

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:54.980
level of transcendent--
transcendence,

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:58.580
and mobilize for Tribalist
and capitalist competition.

00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:01.700
This is my general take
on nationalism in general.

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:05.450
So what I try to do, as
you pointed out Michael,

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:12.320
is that I tried to
substitute not circulation,

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:16.460
but circulatory histories
for the linear tunnel

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:18.260
histories of nations
and civilizations

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:21.920
with the idea of
circulatory histories.

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.000
And now, I'm trying to--

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.750
I'm developing a paper on it.

00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:25.850
And one of the--

00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:31.130
one of the common sort of
ways in which I thought

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:34.370
could be very usable was the
Deleuze and Guattari idea

00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:37.250
of rhizomatiks,
right, which were

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:39.530
the same thing can appear
in different places

00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:41.330
simultaneously.

00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:43.530
But I'm now much more
persuaded, although I

00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:46.070
have to study much more
physics for that, to talk

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:47.930
about in terms of
currents, ocean

00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:54.350
currents, and the whole sort
of ocean physics in a way,

00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:56.300
and how that also redistributes.

00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:59.060
And it ties back, of course,
to the natural sphere

00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:00.630
in very interesting
kinds of ways.

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:03.280
So does the rhizome, but--

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:05.260
but I'm still working on that.

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:06.920
So maybe in a year.

00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:13.600
So, what is circulatory history?

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:17.190
Events have effects that
disperse over space and time,

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:18.010
right?

00:36:18.010 --> 00:36:22.530
A major wall can have
distant effects on prices,

00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:29.230
or political alliances in third,
fourth 20,000 other places.

00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:31.930
And I'll just give a
personal narrative.

00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:36.080
Not a personal, a personal
historical narrative,

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:38.870
which is the case of the Ahomes.

00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:41.650
The Ahomes-- I come
from a part of India

00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:44.840
called Assam in northeast India.

00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:46.600
Here, you can see that.

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:48.450
Where is the pointer?

00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:49.600
Is the pointer working?

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:51.881
Do I point here?

00:36:51.881 --> 00:36:53.050
Yeah, there it is.

00:36:53.050 --> 00:36:57.670
This is Assam, where you have
the Brahmaputra River out here,

00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:58.750
right?

00:36:58.750 --> 00:37:03.260
Now, and this is, you can
see, it is Yunnan, right?

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:06.760
Just around here, Yunnan.

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:10.450
The Ahomes came to
the Brahmaputra region

00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:12.700
in the 13th century.

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:16.900
They were part of the Dali
kingdom, or the Delhi kingdom,

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:19.570
until the 14th century, which
was an independent Buddhist

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:24.850
kingdom not controlled
by the Chinese empires.

00:37:24.850 --> 00:37:29.200
Until the Mongols come, and
then the Mongols overrun it,

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:31.150
and the Thais are gone.

00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:35.390
It's not exactly true, but
it's pretty close to the truth.

00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:39.640
Go on to create Thailand,
what is now the--

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:43.120
the Thais of Thailand, where
is one of the very important

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:45.340
vessels groups comes--

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:48.580
come over, go to the west,
to the Brahmaputra River,

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:49.900
called the Ahomes.

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:54.070
And manage-- they have very
good river technologies.

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:55.720
And they keep out the Mongols.

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:56.530
They keep out.

00:37:56.530 --> 00:37:58.460
And it's not until
the 19th century,

00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:00.910
when the British conquered
them, that you have it.

00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:02.410
So what they also import--

00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:03.632
they Hinduize after a while.

00:38:03.632 --> 00:38:06.090
They [INAUDIBLE],, and they
import people from north India.

00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:09.950
And people of my class
background from Assam

00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:12.980
will say oh yes, we are
from those families,

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:14.560
whether or not we
are from there.

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:17.110
Nonetheless, it is
the Mongol invasion

00:38:17.110 --> 00:38:20.200
that made us who we are
there right now, right?

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:23.740
So talk about the effects
of circulatory histories.

00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:30.170
Now of course, and I always
take the example of it's

00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:32.150
also narratives which change.

00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:35.480
With the dispersal of the event,
and the effects of the events,

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.730
the narratives also change.

00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:45.350
So at the time of the 1940s,
you had Japanese imperialism

00:38:45.350 --> 00:38:47.420
celebrating its great victories.

00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:49.490
With today, it's
turned against it

00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:51.590
very much by those
very people, places

00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:54.260
where it is, where there's
Taiwanese Aboriginals,

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:58.010
or Koreans, or
Chinese, and so on.

00:38:58.010 --> 00:39:02.180
And there may even come a time
when, well, they resisted it

00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:04.610
so far, when Japanese
schoolchildren are reading

00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:07.160
textbooks about their
imperial history that

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:12.030
has a very different view from
what it was at a certain time.

00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:16.430
So there is a certain
sort of looping back

00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:18.380
to events and their
concatenations

00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:20.730
with different
meanings and endings.

00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:24.210
So this is the way in which
history really circulates,

00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:26.120
is circulatory, both in--

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:28.640
I also give this other
example of Marxism

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:32.030
coming into China from several
different sources, right?

00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:36.420
Japan, Russia,
France, and so on.

00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:38.000
But it comes in.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.460
Of course, the local
force transforms it,

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:42.640
becomes a peasant
revolution, right?

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:44.270
Maoism taught.

00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:46.310
But then-- and
that goes out then,

00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:48.120
cycles out to the
rest of the world.

00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:49.550
But what does it become now?

00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:52.310
Essentially, if you look
at what Maoism is today,

00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:53.729
it is a Tribalist movement.

00:39:53.729 --> 00:39:55.520
You have it among
[INAUDIBLE],, you have it

00:39:55.520 --> 00:40:00.590
among Central Asians, you have
it among central India in Nepal

00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:01.880
and these kinds of places.

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:04.370
They're essentially
Tribalist movements.

00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:07.610
And so you have these
kinds of transformations,

00:40:07.610 --> 00:40:10.171
but the reference is still back
to a certain type of Marxism,

00:40:10.171 --> 00:40:10.670
right?

00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:13.130
That's going around
and shaping societies

00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:14.520
and reshaping society.

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:17.060
So that's the kind of
thing I want to talk about.

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:21.440
The important point here is that
history is a shared planetary

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:22.610
heritage.

00:40:22.610 --> 00:40:25.580
We need to realize transcendence
at a planetary level

00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:28.460
to match the global
nature of human history,

00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:31.220
and the problems humans
have created, right?

00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:39.380
So it's really going to be very
difficult to validly depict

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:42.650
national histories as the basis
of the kind of sovereignty

00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:47.540
that opposes all
kinds of interventions

00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:49.580
that are necessary.

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:53.000
So here-- I mean, this
has been well studied.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.200
The Himalayan
rivers, as you know,

00:40:55.200 --> 00:41:01.685
have produced life for
over a billion people,

00:41:01.685 --> 00:41:05.780
billion and a half, and
many, many species around

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:08.210
in the circa Himalayan region.

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:11.390
And what is happening with
glacial melting, river

00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:13.970
diversions, which is
happening in China, and now

00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:15.590
also in India.

00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:20.780
And a dam building, most of
all, are endangering the sources

00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:23.000
of livelihoods of these people.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.160
And intergovernmental
cooperation

00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:27.240
is absolutely essential.

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:29.330
But you find that there
are three countries

00:41:29.330 --> 00:41:32.240
in the world in
particular who refuse

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:36.620
to share information and
cooperate internationally

00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:38.300
on river knowledge.

00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:42.890
And how much sedimentation
is taking place, how much.

00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:46.730
And they are, as you
would guess, one is China,

00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:50.060
one is Turkey, and
the third is Rwanda.

00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:52.560
And you know what they
all have in common?

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:55.720
Any guesses?

00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:58.870
Rivers originate
in those countries.

00:41:58.870 --> 00:42:01.630
I was standing there giving
this talk in a Tibetan student

00:42:01.630 --> 00:42:06.380
government, I said, oh,
that would be Tibet.

00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:11.700
And so there was, yes, I guess
if you can make that claim.

00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:13.750
So this is a huge
problem, right?

00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:16.480
That you cannot find out.

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:18.670
It's not-- it's
not easy to have.

00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:22.150
And the Mekong Commission,
which is among the most active,

00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:24.220
and there's a lot of
work on Mekong calling

00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:27.070
about social act, civil
society activists,

00:42:27.070 --> 00:42:30.950
and political activists, is
been one of the most successful.

00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:35.810
But still way, way
below what should be--

00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:38.910
what should be happening there.

00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:41.750
So is it possible to
elevate sustainability

00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:44.540
to a transcendent level, right?

00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:47.510
It seems to me most
people will say, well,

00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:50.710
it's corporations and
capitalism and so on.

00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:54.030
Well, certainly that
is definitely an issue.

00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:57.470
But I think the
more proximate issue

00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:59.780
is the problem of
national leaders

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:03.410
and how they're so tied
in to the ideologies

00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:06.000
of national interests.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.120
For example, you
had the proposal

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:14.480
of Mutsuyoshi Nishimura, who
was the first in the Kyoto

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:18.290
Protocol, he was the chief
climate negotiator for Japan.

00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:24.620
And he had a very simple,
a very elegant proposal.

00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:27.650
He said the government
should collectively

00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:34.220
own a capped carbon budget of
$660 billion gigatons of CO2

00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:38.580
in total emissions
between 2010 and 2050.

00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:41.570
And then he had this
idea that these credits

00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:45.610
will be auctioned off on
a polluter pay principle.

00:43:45.610 --> 00:43:49.940
And that those
payments will then

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:53.870
seek to recover the
damages that were caused.

00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:57.410
And he had all kinds of
provisions for handicapped--

00:43:57.410 --> 00:44:01.490
for handicapped provisions for
developing societies and so on.

00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:04.100
And it was something
that certainly the NGOs

00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:05.990
who had been among
the main forces

00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:09.500
behind all these climate
change talks, had agreed on.

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:11.270
And they had the
principle agreement

00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:12.450
on this kind of thing.

00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:14.630
But it was always the
national governments

00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:18.911
that would claim national
mitigation circumstances

00:44:18.911 --> 00:44:19.410
and so on.

00:44:19.410 --> 00:44:22.010
And for a long time, it
was China and the US.

00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:24.447
The US saying you all, you're
polluting totally much more.

00:44:24.447 --> 00:44:26.030
And then China was
saying well, you've

00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:29.780
done it historically per
capita so much more, and so on.

00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:35.960
Then finally we get to
some kind of first step

00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:40.760
with the Paris 2015 UN
Climate Change Conference,

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:43.190
what is known as COP 21.

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:45.750
And that was a huge
moment of celebration,

00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:47.330
although it was just
the first stage.

00:44:47.330 --> 00:44:49.550
Because it was all
voluntary, and it and it

00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:53.630
didn't have anything to
do with your capacities

00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:55.170
to implement any of that.

00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:56.780
And then we come
to a stage now when

00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:58.880
that's off the table
with the US, right?

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:01.890
So we'll have to
see now what's--

00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:06.260
so it's always many steps
backwards at every point.

00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:09.500
So although, as I said,
government and inter-government

00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:12.410
agencies are officially
behind this effort,

00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:14.120
it is really global
civil society

00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:17.460
that is the main pressure
group behind them,

00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:21.170
NGOs, quasi-government
agencies, like IBCC

00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:24.260
and things like that,
private-public initiatives.

00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:26.300
All of these have
been very important

00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:29.480
in this whole
movement in the world.

00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:31.880
And not least among these
is the transformation

00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:35.480
of religious societies
in the world.

00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:38.760
Now, of course, the pope
has gotten very big into it.

00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:43.370
But until recently, it was many
Asian societies which had--

00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:45.410
Asian religious
group which embed

00:45:45.410 --> 00:45:50.360
dialogical but authoritative
realm for self formation

00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:53.030
and values renewal, right?

00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:57.800
So what I want to discuss is the
tendency towards the converging

00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:02.750
goals for both religious and
non-religious social groups,

00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:06.230
civil societies, is
linked by this idea

00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:11.630
of ecological spirituality,
which Buddha talked about.

00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:14.960
First, let me talk a little
bit about cultural circulations

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:16.580
in the Anthropocene.

00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:19.520
So it's part of the circulatory
history moment, right?

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:21.440
One of the examples
I give in my book

00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:23.990
that people seem to
enjoy much is the idea

00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:26.960
of Ram Mohan Roy, who
is often considered

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:28.340
the father of modern India.

00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:32.570
And in 1831 he was in Bristol.

00:46:32.570 --> 00:46:33.410
He was a Unitarian.

00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:36.770
He was a-- he was a
Vendantist, but he

00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:41.950
saw an equation between the
Vendanta and Unitarianism.

00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:45.560
And he was in Bristol.

00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:49.470
And I found this letter
circulating in Peabody,

00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:51.020
in the Peabody--

00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:55.340
in the Salem archive that
has this little fragment

00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:59.120
that Ram Mohan Roy
will come in to Salem.

00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:03.920
And so we are circulating
this lock of hair of his,

00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:06.770
in order to sort of celebrate
his saintliness and things

00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:07.980
like that.

00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:12.710
And he couldn't come, because
he dies just then in 1831.

00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:15.980
And so but then
apparently that opened up

00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:19.280
a whole archive, which showed
how Thoreau and Emerson had

00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:21.110
read some of his
translations and well,

00:47:21.110 --> 00:47:24.350
other translations also, but
had read some of his stuff

00:47:24.350 --> 00:47:26.150
and were preparing
to start over.

00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:27.740
And this led very
much to the kind

00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:31.940
of Peruvian transcendentalism,
right, which in turn--

00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:34.170
and civil disobedience,
which, in turn,

00:47:34.170 --> 00:47:36.200
influences someone like Gandhi.

00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:38.970
Although Gandhi doesn't fully
admit it, but through Tolstoy

00:47:38.970 --> 00:47:41.140
it influences Gandhi.

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:43.090
And Gandhi then, of
course, influences

00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:44.410
Martin Luther King, right?

00:47:44.410 --> 00:47:49.370
So you get the sort of looping
back and forth the whole time,

00:47:49.370 --> 00:47:53.050
which is part of this cultural
circulations, right, of what we

00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:56.260
can call spirituality, right?

00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:57.940
So they are-- they
have typically

00:47:57.940 --> 00:48:00.370
been thought of as
counter-cultural movements

00:48:00.370 --> 00:48:04.240
among hippies, or urban groups,
or rural reconstructions

00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:05.170
in East Asia.

00:48:05.170 --> 00:48:06.690
I think they're very important.

00:48:06.690 --> 00:48:08.950
And in the Transpacific,
but I think

00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:11.110
they're developing
a new relevance

00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:14.740
as their causes become
tied to the most

00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:18.410
marginal groups in
Asian societies,

00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:20.500
and I would say in
Latin American societies

00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:25.100
and African societies to
a lesser extent as well.

00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:27.700
So on the one hand, you have
American spiritualist movements

00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:30.610
that embrace a
holistic view of nature

00:48:30.610 --> 00:48:34.180
from Thoreau, to deep
ecologists, to World Wildlife,

00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:36.910
to all of these
kinds of agencies.

00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:40.900
Both, I would say, on the
extreme wilderness Ang

00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:44.350
side, but also the corporatist
types like Conservation

00:48:44.350 --> 00:48:46.499
International and so on,
who I think also have

00:48:46.499 --> 00:48:47.665
some very interesting ideas.

00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:55.120
But they're forging
linkages with groups

00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:57.400
that are developing
around Gandhian ideas,

00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:01.180
around Buddhist forests
monks, among Daoist temples,

00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:03.280
and others as well.

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:06.234
So at first glance, this
seems like little driblets

00:49:06.234 --> 00:49:07.150
that are going around.

00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:08.566
But I think one
of the things that

00:49:08.566 --> 00:49:11.800
is really transforming them
is this hyper-connectedness

00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:12.940
of our age.

00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:14.830
And I'll talk a
little bit about how

00:49:14.830 --> 00:49:16.840
this kind of the
new civil society

00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:19.300
that-- the new media
civil society, which

00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:21.370
also has such
destructive effects,

00:49:21.370 --> 00:49:25.800
can also create new types
of allegiances and alliances

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:29.500
that give it a certain
flexibility and resilience,

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:30.060
I think.

00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:35.830
You can just look at Hong Kong,
the way it's been resilient.

00:49:35.830 --> 00:49:39.070
What they do is these different
types of movements that

00:49:39.070 --> 00:49:41.350
are converging, I
think they converge

00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:45.800
upon a non-binary philosophical
attitude with consequences

00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:49.330
not only for lifestyle changes,
but for the ecological future

00:49:49.330 --> 00:49:52.320
of the planet.

00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:54.900
As I keep saying, it
is a very weak force,

00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:56.790
but a very resilient
form of politics

00:49:56.790 --> 00:49:59.970
that networks across the
global space of the new media

00:49:59.970 --> 00:50:01.530
to achieve some of its goals.

00:50:01.530 --> 00:50:04.990
I'll give you some
examples of that.

00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:07.980
First, we-- just a little
explanation on the term

00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:09.090
spirituality.

00:50:09.090 --> 00:50:12.960
The way I define spirituality,
also taken in collaboration

00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:15.000
with Peter van der
Veer and others,

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:21.300
is that really it is a residual
realm for the transcendent that

00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:24.210
comes, that emerges
with the global trend

00:50:24.210 --> 00:50:27.780
towards secularization,
privatization of religion,

00:50:27.780 --> 00:50:30.960
the destructuralization, and
particularly the laicization,

00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:33.677
especially in Europe
that happens here,

00:50:33.677 --> 00:50:35.760
which is I think at the
root of the green movement

00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:37.530
and so on as well.

00:50:37.530 --> 00:50:40.080
Modern spirituality
as such is a new step

00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:44.550
in historical society, which is
derided as dreamy but important

00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:45.720
repository.

00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:48.450
And we know that
it was in the West.

00:50:48.450 --> 00:50:51.360
It was started very much
with the Unitarians,

00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:55.560
the theosophists, new age
spirituality, and so on.

00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:57.870
And as I've discussed,
in North America,

00:50:57.870 --> 00:51:00.720
ecological spirituality
John Thoreau--

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:04.260
I mean, Thoreau's
spirit insights

00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:05.850
were carried
particularly by people

00:51:05.850 --> 00:51:08.980
like John Miller, Aldo
Leopold, of course,

00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:12.036
Rachel Carsons, and all
those people [INAUDIBLE]..

00:51:12.036 --> 00:51:15.180
And today has emerged as
a significant American

00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:18.780
environmental movement, although
it has many different branches.

00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:20.760
And you already begin
to see the hook up

00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:23.880
with Asian
environmentalists thought

00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:28.440
and proto-environmentalists
thought with American Buddhists

00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:29.560
and others, right?

00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:33.680
Like Gary Snyder, Alan
Watts, and others.

00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:36.600
Today, modern associational
groups and circles

00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:39.000
have also grown in Asia,
Latin America, and Africa,

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.980
who seek to protect
the environment

00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:43.110
and join with the
people who are really

00:51:43.110 --> 00:51:46.800
most immediately and
most powerfully affected

00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:48.330
by climate change.

00:51:48.330 --> 00:51:51.700
That is marginal indigenous
traditional communities

00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:54.810
who have been bearing the brunt
of the ecological devastation

00:51:54.810 --> 00:51:56.310
of the world.

00:51:56.310 --> 00:52:00.805
These marginal communities often
tend to view nature as sacred.

00:52:00.805 --> 00:52:04.260
Though not necessarily, we
shouldn't romanticize them,

00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:07.980
but they often need to view it
as sacred in order to preserve

00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:09.990
what they have, the
little that they have .

00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:11.480
And they often use--

00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:16.110
and they employ the
psychology to protect it.

00:52:16.110 --> 00:52:18.630
If you look at tree-hugging
movements and so on,

00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:23.220
these have very much to do with
their local notions of what

00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:24.120
nature is about.

00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:27.150
And the biggest environmental
movement in India

00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:28.800
took off with the
Cziko movement,

00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:31.980
which is a tree-hugging hugging
movement of 1972, right?

00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:37.190
And spawned a huge
movement from there.

00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:39.660
I mean this kind of alliance
is not just happening

00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:41.890
in the developing world.

00:52:41.890 --> 00:52:44.620
And I will give you an
example of the Dakota Access

00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:48.250
Pipeline, which could
have had a huge impact.

00:52:48.250 --> 00:52:54.760
Until, I think it was January,
the Army Reserve Corps

00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:58.990
of Engineers had agreed that
this will not take place

00:52:58.990 --> 00:53:01.240
in this Dakota country, right?

00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:03.730
And it was only with
the new president,

00:53:03.730 --> 00:53:06.750
with that unnamed
president, who--

00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:08.140
were this was reversed.

00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:11.140
So if it had been
pursued, it could

00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:12.940
have had a rolling effect.

00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:14.050
I think it's set back now.

00:53:14.050 --> 00:53:15.633
I don't think it's
going to disappear.

00:53:15.633 --> 00:53:19.620
But you did have a lot of
people mobilize around it.

00:53:23.250 --> 00:53:26.720
And there's a lot of indigenous
symbolism and sort of nature,

00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:29.030
sacristy, and so on
going on here as well.

00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:35.040
Now, within the
Asian traditions,

00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:38.180
we have theologically an Indic,
Chinese, and indigenous peoples

00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:39.320
cosmology.

00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:42.350
The sacredness of nature
is of course a byproduct

00:53:42.350 --> 00:53:46.640
of a perspective integrating
social moral and natural order,

00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:49.060
what in Chinese is
known as tianren

00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:51.740
heyi, the organic unity.

00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:55.940
And this is of course
now something that has--

00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:58.490
that was forgotten for
the last 100 years,

00:53:58.490 --> 00:54:01.460
but it's coming back
in a big way not least

00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:04.160
due to some of Professor
Puett's efforts

00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:08.270
I'm sure, since he has
such an impact on the most

00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:13.630
impactful class in the US.

00:54:13.630 --> 00:54:19.280
So but also I should say that
John and Mary Evelyn have left,

00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:23.090
but this whole religion,
the whole study

00:54:23.090 --> 00:54:25.670
of religion and environment,
begins at Harvard

00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:29.090
with Mary Ellen Tucker
and John Graham, who

00:54:29.090 --> 00:54:35.910
produce the 10 volumes of world
religions and the environment,

00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:37.010
right?

00:54:37.010 --> 00:54:40.130
In the 90s, I think it was.

00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:43.060
So they were really ahead
of their time in many ways.

00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:46.280
What draws these divers
currents and phenomena is

00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:50.840
their anti-dualism, the
idea that you cannot have

00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:54.110
an integrated and organic
view, cannot operate

00:54:54.110 --> 00:54:58.580
on the assumption that humans
and nature are a binary,

00:54:58.580 --> 00:55:02.690
that humans can in fact
conquer nature as something.

00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:05.790
And rather see nature is
very much part of yourself.

00:55:05.790 --> 00:55:09.230
I'm sure you heard a lot
about this in your discussions

00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:13.290
here before, so I won't
bore you with those details.

00:55:13.290 --> 00:55:17.700
But I do have lots
of examples here,

00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:22.800
which I don't think we need to
go into since time is short.

00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:26.400
But one of the very
important activists

00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:29.250
in all these Asian
religions are in fact

00:55:29.250 --> 00:55:35.730
the Thai Cambodian
Laotian Buddhist monks.

00:55:35.730 --> 00:55:37.830
These are forest
monks who have--

00:55:37.830 --> 00:55:41.190
I've been spending a lot of
time with the Cambodian monks

00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:44.490
and the local communities who
have now sort of taken over

00:55:44.490 --> 00:55:45.150
from the monks.

00:55:45.150 --> 00:55:47.700
The monks are also
still very important,

00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:51.870
as they have this ceremony
of ordinating trees, right?

00:55:51.870 --> 00:55:55.590
And the ceremonial
role being of trees

00:55:55.590 --> 00:56:00.570
and so on, which has unleashed
a very powerful movement

00:56:00.570 --> 00:56:05.940
against deforestation and dam
building in those regions.

00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:09.310
And the Thai Buddhist monk
Bhikku Buddhadasa, of course,

00:56:09.310 --> 00:56:10.250
puts it very simply.

00:56:10.250 --> 00:56:12.480
He says once--
the way he relates

00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:15.810
it is that one's realization
of the interconnected

00:56:15.810 --> 00:56:19.450
of all-- interconnectedness
of all things in life forms,

00:56:19.450 --> 00:56:21.420
which are transient
and changeable,

00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:23.670
will help deflate
one's ego, knowing

00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:25.560
that everyone is
one and the same,

00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:28.740
being subject to the
same natural laws.

00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:31.350
His spirituality rejected
specific religious

00:56:31.350 --> 00:56:32.160
identification.

00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:35.670
He was very much the
spirituality mode,

00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:37.810
this non institutionalized
religion,

00:56:37.810 --> 00:56:41.610
this de-institutionalized
notion of something spiritual.

00:56:41.610 --> 00:56:44.190
And he was one of the
most important, I think,

00:56:44.190 --> 00:56:47.100
inspirations for the forest
monk environmental movements.

00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:51.030
The other place that this
is very important is Taiwan.

00:56:51.030 --> 00:56:54.420
Taiwan has one of the most
dynamic civil societies in Asia

00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:55.480
today.

00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:59.130
And within that, the Buddhist
groups are very powerful.

00:56:59.130 --> 00:57:01.230
You all heard of Ciji,
but there's Fagu,

00:57:01.230 --> 00:57:02.510
there's Foguan [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:02.510 --> 00:57:04.360
There are many others.

00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:08.340
And all of them have as
one of the central planks,

00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:11.040
the central plank in
most, one vow, which

00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:13.560
is protect the environment.

00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:16.330
And you may have individual
critiques of what they do

00:57:16.330 --> 00:57:18.690
or what they don't and
how much they give in

00:57:18.690 --> 00:57:20.730
and how much they don't,
but there are also

00:57:20.730 --> 00:57:24.840
some very powerful thinkers
among some of these.

00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:28.790
I have worked on one
or two of them as well.

00:57:28.790 --> 00:57:33.780
So, and anyway, there's
a lot more here.

00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:35.870
I don't think we need
to go into all of this.

00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:38.960
But I do want to sort of try
and understand-- try and see

00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:42.920
how we can understand the
relationship of these religions

00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:46.632
to this, what is ultimately
a new project, right?

00:57:46.632 --> 00:57:47.840
The Environmental Protection.

00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:50.040
You can say that Daoism
is interested in nature.

00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:53.510
Therefore, it's a
smooth, continuous flow.

00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:55.760
So we really have
to change our notion

00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:57.410
of historical understanding.

00:57:57.410 --> 00:58:00.470
It's not one of
substantial transition

00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:03.470
from the substance of one thing
to a substance of another.

00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:05.840
It's if we look at it from
the philosophical idea

00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:10.250
of emergence, then
you know that when

00:58:10.250 --> 00:58:14.180
a historical event or process
impacts the social formation,

00:58:14.180 --> 00:58:16.970
it effects an emergence which
combines both the prevailing

00:58:16.970 --> 00:58:18.680
factor and the new thing.

00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:20.630
But the interesting
historical problem

00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:24.800
is that the new phenomenon
seeks to justify itself only

00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:26.810
in terms of the old, right?

00:58:26.810 --> 00:58:30.230
So this is the narrative
challenging, as it

00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:33.220
were, the circulation, right?

00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:36.290
And I think that we've
had-- all of deconstruction

00:58:36.290 --> 00:58:39.350
has been based on this,
the separation, right?

00:58:39.350 --> 00:58:40.670
Your claim.

00:58:40.670 --> 00:58:42.740
And I think we should
really go beyond that

00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:45.500
and recognize, with people
like Paul Ricoeur and so on,

00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:48.020
that the important
thing is the pertinence.

00:58:48.020 --> 00:58:50.210
If these people feel
impelled to do something,

00:58:50.210 --> 00:58:51.770
that is a good cause, right?

00:58:51.770 --> 00:58:54.230
And they connected with
something that they can see

00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:56.030
was there, then that's
good enough, right?

00:58:56.030 --> 00:58:58.070
What is the pertinence,
and does the permanence

00:58:58.070 --> 00:59:00.510
have persuasive power?

00:59:00.510 --> 00:59:05.150
So I think this is something
very important, that.

00:59:05.150 --> 00:59:07.460
And here I just
want to talk about,

00:59:07.460 --> 00:59:12.260
and I'm also indebted once
again to Mary Evelyn for this,

00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:15.350
Pope Francis's June
2015 encyclical

00:59:15.350 --> 00:59:17.245
on care for our common home.

00:59:17.245 --> 00:59:19.370
This is a very radical
document, and likely to have

00:59:19.370 --> 00:59:20.810
a huge impact,
because it's going

00:59:20.810 --> 00:59:22.830
to be thought in all
the Catholic schools

00:59:22.830 --> 00:59:24.510
around the world.

00:59:24.510 --> 00:59:28.580
And which integrates
ecology and justice.

00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:31.760
And it's very radical,
because popes earlier had

00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:35.150
made kind of environmental
noises earlier,

00:59:35.150 --> 00:59:39.170
but they stayed within the
framework of the stewardship

00:59:39.170 --> 00:59:39.770
argument.

00:59:39.770 --> 00:59:42.200
Now, those of you who are
in environmental humanities

00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:45.110
would be familiar with
Lynn White's critique

00:59:45.110 --> 00:59:48.590
of Christianity as
something that sees nature

00:59:48.590 --> 00:59:51.170
as something given by God
to humans to do whatever

00:59:51.170 --> 00:59:52.280
you like with it, right?

00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:55.970
For your bounty.

00:59:55.970 --> 01:00:01.760
And the response of the church
to that kind of critique

01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:05.090
is that while God gave it to
humans to be a steward of,

01:00:05.090 --> 01:00:06.200
to steward it, right?

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:10.490
So there's still a duality,
but it's one of care.

01:00:10.490 --> 01:00:14.690
And what this pope
does is that he

01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:19.580
does refer, for various
reasons, to many earlier pope's

01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:21.890
statements and things
that-- but he's changing

01:00:21.890 --> 01:00:23.540
the underlying argument.

01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:25.880
It's not about
stewardship or anything.

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:30.170
It is tied very much on a
very different concept of what

01:00:30.170 --> 01:00:32.360
is the divine will, right?

01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:35.120
He's talking about-- he
invokes Mother Earth,

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:37.940
he invokes Francis of Assisi.

01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:41.900
And he really refers
to integral ecology,

01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:43.870
connecting humans
to the environment,

01:00:43.870 --> 01:00:46.700
and to the evolutionary
process, right?

01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:48.560
So he's making these
radical changes

01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:51.470
framed within of course a
hermeneutic tradition, which

01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:52.994
he has to.

01:00:52.994 --> 01:00:55.160
But it really gives you the
sense of the pertinence.

01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:56.540
Is it pertinent or not?

01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:58.160
How is it going to be accepted?

01:00:58.160 --> 01:00:58.730
And how long?

01:00:58.730 --> 01:01:00.560
We don't know how long
this pope will last.

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:03.750
But there are many forces
working against him.

01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:05.360
But I think he's
turning out to be

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:09.930
one of the most interesting
figures of our time.

01:01:09.930 --> 01:01:14.040
Of course, we've talked also
about India and the Hindu

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:16.200
groups that are
fashioning themselves also

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:17.825
in this response.

01:01:17.825 --> 01:01:19.200
Of course, here
there's a problem

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:23.220
that you get Hindu poulsbo mixed
in with the Hindu naturalism

01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:23.760
and so on.

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:26.970
But those are one of the
problems that we also have.

01:01:26.970 --> 01:01:29.910
I talked about Taiwan.

01:01:29.910 --> 01:01:32.010
So these religious
groups in Asia

01:01:32.010 --> 01:01:34.200
may be particularly
suited to mediate

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:37.510
between precarious
local communities

01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:41.370
and this transcendence
of sustainability.

01:01:41.370 --> 01:01:43.110
In many parts of
Asia, communities

01:01:43.110 --> 01:01:45.360
are resisting efforts to
exploit or industrialize

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:48.450
their natural resources, but
appealing to the security

01:01:48.450 --> 01:01:49.960
of commons, right?

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:52.800
Daoism, animism, Buddhism,
Christianity, Hinduism

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:57.080
are utilized to protect
resources by using terminology

01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:59.040
in China of shantou, right?

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:00.720
These are sort of
sacred home lands,

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:02.580
sacred groves, the hope--

01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:05.220
whole segments of Yunnan
are now considered

01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:09.210
to be sacred forests of
marginal peoples and so on.

01:02:09.210 --> 01:02:12.390
Community forests, holy
water, especially in India,

01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:16.200
to oppose local environmental
pollution now, apparently.

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:19.170
Talking about the environment,
the legal underpinnings,

01:02:19.170 --> 01:02:21.060
the Ganges polluted as it is.

01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:23.990
One of the most polluted
rivers probably in the world.

01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:30.090
As now, it's now considered
to be a crime, a legal crime

01:02:30.090 --> 01:02:30.675
to pollute.

01:02:30.675 --> 01:02:31.800
And no-- what is it called?

01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:35.160
The Ganges is considered to be
the equivalent of a person, has

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:36.760
the rights of a person.

01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:39.840
So you can be charged
for killing it, right?

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:41.600
So you can get that
kind of sentence.

01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:43.141
And this of course,
in Latin America,

01:02:43.141 --> 01:02:45.840
you have a lot of these
countries with trees and so on.

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:48.270
So I think there is a
kind of legal underpinning

01:02:48.270 --> 01:02:53.940
to this idea of the sacristy
of natural creatures,

01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:55.850
I should say.

01:02:55.850 --> 01:02:57.960
And I've talked about
several of these.

01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:02.130
Here is a conference I did in,
just two or three months ago,

01:03:02.130 --> 01:03:03.750
in Phnom Penh.

01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:05.730
And where it was
really exciting,

01:03:05.730 --> 01:03:08.700
because you could see
although it was started

01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:11.392
by these [INAUDIBLE] group,
a [INAUDIBLE] and there

01:03:11.392 --> 01:03:12.850
are two or three
different forests.

01:03:12.850 --> 01:03:18.870
Bihar, [INAUDIBLE],, these
were forest dwellers,

01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:23.340
semi sort of Cambodian
and semi tribal.

01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:25.350
They were Hindu Buddhist.

01:03:25.350 --> 01:03:27.750
And they took on the movement.

01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:30.300
And once they started
digging on the movement,

01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:31.860
the Buddhists joined them.

01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:33.810
And then local civil
society joined them.

01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:37.290
And it became so
prominent that it got

01:03:37.290 --> 01:03:39.750
the attention of global media.

01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:41.940
And suddenly, it
became a place where

01:03:41.940 --> 01:03:47.010
all levels of civil society
began to enter there.

01:03:47.010 --> 01:03:49.890
So there were-- they
set up very articulate.

01:03:49.890 --> 01:03:56.760
At this particular-- this monk
to your right, by the way,

01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:58.240
he's in--

01:03:58.240 --> 01:03:59.160
I have his name.

01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:01.340
Venerable Ben Solute, I think.

01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:04.020
He's at UVA, this guy.

01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:05.340
Very articulate.

01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:08.190
He spent a lot of time in
India, so he speaks English.

01:04:08.190 --> 01:04:11.700
And he is very interesting.

01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:15.060
The other guy is
probably, but he's--

01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:17.562
he says I talk to
[INAUDIBLE] all the time.

01:04:17.562 --> 01:04:19.770
You don't want to go too
close to a person like that.

01:04:19.770 --> 01:04:22.560
But the other guy, he
doesn't speak English,

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:25.230
but he seems to be much more--

01:04:25.230 --> 01:04:27.070
with much greater integrity.

01:04:27.070 --> 01:04:31.550
Anyway, he won't
talk to [INAUDIBLE]..

01:04:31.550 --> 01:04:33.820
Here are some of the pictures.

01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:36.510
This is also from
the cover of my book.

01:04:36.510 --> 01:04:40.170
This is a very-- this are
these, this group that has been

01:04:40.170 --> 01:04:43.260
demonstrating since I think 20--

01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:44.730
long before 2010.

01:04:44.730 --> 01:04:47.790
But they got-- came
to attention in 2011.

01:04:47.790 --> 01:04:51.390
What they're doing, they call
themselves Cambodia's avatars.

01:04:51.390 --> 01:04:54.060
And for them, avatar has a
meaning in the Hindu Buddhist

01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:55.890
tradition.

01:04:55.890 --> 01:05:00.450
And what they did is they began
to lead weekly demonstrations

01:05:00.450 --> 01:05:05.010
in the main square in Phnom
Penh, where they would engage

01:05:05.010 --> 01:05:08.560
in their own forms of ritual
theaters of protest, right?

01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:09.910
So it will be something.

01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:11.790
It would be ritualized.

01:05:11.790 --> 01:05:13.020
It would be theatrical.

01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:14.010
But it was a petition.

01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:16.380
It was their form of protests.

01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:18.840
And it attracted
so much attention.

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:20.970
And they took on
the name avatar,

01:05:20.970 --> 01:05:25.980
but not because of their local
meaning, but because the movie.

01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:33.180
So they're depicting themselves
as this creature below, right?

01:05:33.180 --> 01:05:36.401
So that is what this
whole thing is all about.

01:05:36.401 --> 01:05:38.900
But that's a very interesting
aspect of circulatory history,

01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:42.510
where it comes back again to
you but via the global media,

01:05:42.510 --> 01:05:43.410
right?

01:05:43.410 --> 01:05:46.119
And they got huge global
attention on this.

01:05:46.119 --> 01:05:48.660
And I think there are several
people, several groups that are

01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:49.929
studying the impact of avatar.

01:05:49.929 --> 01:05:51.720
I don't know if they
started studying this.

01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:53.465
I don't think those
two have been joined.

01:05:53.465 --> 01:05:57.330
It's a good cultural
studies project.

01:05:57.330 --> 01:05:59.490
I met several of these people.

01:05:59.490 --> 01:06:01.050
This is dam activism.

01:06:01.050 --> 01:06:03.750
This is the
[INAUDIBLE] movement,

01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:05.670
The tree-hugging
movement that set off

01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:08.490
the whole environmental
movement in India.

01:06:08.490 --> 01:06:13.830
Now, people say that in
China, the environment is so--

01:06:13.830 --> 01:06:16.170
in such bad shape.

01:06:16.170 --> 01:06:18.780
And most of the attention
now is being placed

01:06:18.780 --> 01:06:20.880
on the government's efforts.

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:23.880
And certainly there
has been a great deal

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:26.610
of government effort
recently, but mostly

01:06:26.610 --> 01:06:33.180
in the realm of renewable
energy, and mostly in response

01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:37.170
to middle class
urban Chinese, right?

01:06:37.170 --> 01:06:40.080
So if you know the
movie, Chai Jing's movie

01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:42.840
Under the Dome,
which I should have

01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:44.190
included a discussion of it.

01:06:44.190 --> 01:06:45.750
But it's a very
interesting movie,

01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:48.539
very powerful about how you
cannot breathe in Beijing.

01:06:48.539 --> 01:06:49.830
Now you can't breathe in Delhi.

01:06:52.610 --> 01:06:55.200
And they did manage to
clear, that but how?

01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:58.560
I mean, it brought-- it was
very much a middle class movie,

01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:00.420
a middle class urban movie.

01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:03.990
And whole rural areas continue
to be very much kicking

01:07:03.990 --> 01:07:05.520
the can down the road, right?

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:10.110
So you need a much
greater kind of effort.

01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:12.930
And of course, in China we know
that the principle problem has

01:07:12.930 --> 01:07:16.240
to do with the mixed messages.

01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:19.980
So the center grandpa is
always says good things,

01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:22.090
and even abolishes your taxes.

01:07:22.090 --> 01:07:25.660
But then the local government
has to then pick up the flag,

01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:26.370
right?

01:07:26.370 --> 01:07:28.620
Or pick up whatever
you have to pick up,

01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:30.690
and they have profit
motives, right?

01:07:30.690 --> 01:07:32.740
They have production
targets and so on.

01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:34.320
So that's always
a kind of tension.

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:37.650
So but nonetheless,
environmental NGOs

01:07:37.650 --> 01:07:41.070
have grown by leaps
and bounds in China.

01:07:41.070 --> 01:07:42.690
They have become--

01:07:42.690 --> 01:07:46.840
I don't know if I have it here.

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:48.740
I'll just come back to that.

01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:49.830
I have to show you that.

01:07:53.200 --> 01:08:00.480
Yeah, the numbers in 2008, there
were 2,768 environmental NGOs.

01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:03.780
And by 2013, this
had gone up to 8,000.

01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:05.520
This is one area
of civil society,

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:07.800
the green public sphere,
which is permitted

01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:09.840
in China to some extent.

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:12.570
And the reason it is
permitted is because in a way

01:08:12.570 --> 01:08:14.430
they act as watchdogs.

01:08:14.430 --> 01:08:18.810
They're not activists so much
as protectionists, right?

01:08:18.810 --> 01:08:19.590
They're watchdogs.

01:08:19.590 --> 01:08:22.740
Because the laws are all on
the books, the laws are there,

01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:25.470
but it's really
the implementation.

01:08:25.470 --> 01:08:27.479
So between the media and these--

01:08:27.479 --> 01:08:29.729
and the NGOs you begin to get--

01:08:29.729 --> 01:08:31.830
five minutes more.

01:08:31.830 --> 01:08:40.260
You'll begin to get some kind
of legal results as well.

01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:43.740
But it's a mixed story, of
course, as you'd expect.

01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:46.810
I'll just go back
to this Daoism.

01:08:46.810 --> 01:08:50.850
Now talking about pertinence
and Daoism let me just--

01:08:53.779 --> 01:08:56.060
this is Dao-- you
know the Dao is

01:08:56.060 --> 01:09:01.520
in China, in the post
[INAUDIBLE],, the post opening

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:05.420
years, have been much less
successful in getting attention

01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:08.149
than the Buddhists or
the Confucianists, right?

01:09:08.149 --> 01:09:11.550
And there's no sort of natural
global constituency for them.

01:09:11.550 --> 01:09:13.250
Naturally is important.

01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:17.997
And so when this alliance of
religions and conservations

01:09:17.997 --> 01:09:19.580
approached them--
this is, by the way,

01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:22.899
this is an alliance that's
based in Bath, in England.

01:09:22.899 --> 01:09:25.529
It's been very, very big.

01:09:25.529 --> 01:09:29.270
And it really begins to try and
link up traditional religions

01:09:29.270 --> 01:09:32.420
with conservation efforts.

01:09:32.420 --> 01:09:35.670
They agreed to join
with them, and they

01:09:35.670 --> 01:09:43.460
became-- they declared Lowndes
to be the [INAUDIBLE],, right?

01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:46.010
So Lowndes has become
the protector god

01:09:46.010 --> 01:09:48.040
of the environment, right?

01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:49.040
This is what has become.

01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:51.529
He's officially stated as that.

01:09:51.529 --> 01:09:53.720
And when you go-- and
they, although they

01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:55.970
don't have huge
popular followings,

01:09:55.970 --> 01:09:57.940
they control all
the Daoist temples.

01:09:57.940 --> 01:10:00.680
And I just went to
Mao Shan last summer,

01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:04.370
and they control the temples.

01:10:04.370 --> 01:10:07.250
And they are
beautifully kept now.

01:10:07.250 --> 01:10:11.090
You're not allowed to burn more
than three sticks of incense.

01:10:11.090 --> 01:10:12.170
You have to recycle.

01:10:12.170 --> 01:10:15.530
You have to use
these, what you call,

01:10:15.530 --> 01:10:18.130
these photo roll take--
these, what are they called?

01:10:18.130 --> 01:10:21.300
Anyway, solar energy
and things like that.

01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:24.380
And they have strict rules
of all of these things.

01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:25.970
So at some level, it's working.

01:10:25.970 --> 01:10:28.670
And it is having a
kind of an impact.

01:10:28.670 --> 01:10:31.190
It's part of the
public sphere here.

01:10:31.190 --> 01:10:33.800
And here is-- I love this
flag of theirs, which

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:36.590
is yin-yang in green, right?

01:10:36.590 --> 01:10:37.605
The greening of Daoism.

01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:42.200
And then people
have found all kinds

01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:44.690
of things that have survived
the Chinese revolution

01:10:44.690 --> 01:10:48.410
and the Cultural Revolution,
like this fengshui forest.

01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:51.100
All over, there's
huge forest coverage.

01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:53.910
And fengshui, people are just
beginning to get into it.

01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:56.750
Because fengshui is just seen
as some kind of urban modern,

01:10:56.750 --> 01:10:59.960
urban fad, right?

01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:03.920
But in fact, it's the
[INAUDIBLE] very much

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:08.660
at the core of it is this idea
of the organic nature of human

01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:12.720
and natural prosperity, that
the two cannot be separated.

01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:16.250
So you have Chris Coggins is
doing very good work on this

01:11:16.250 --> 01:11:18.700
with his whole team in China.

01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:20.750
And the Chinese
local government,

01:11:20.750 --> 01:11:23.000
several local governments
have become involved in this

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.230
as well.

01:11:24.230 --> 01:11:26.210
There's one thing
that more I want

01:11:26.210 --> 01:11:28.454
to talk about the Chinese
green public sphere,

01:11:28.454 --> 01:11:29.870
on the global green
public sphere,

01:11:29.870 --> 01:11:33.560
and the relationship
between these popular--

01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:36.560
and whether or not
religious movements

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:38.320
and global civil society.

01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:40.440
I'll give you just one example.

01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:45.710
In the mid 1990s,
in the early 1990s

01:11:45.710 --> 01:11:48.500
when the Three Gorges
Dam was being set up,

01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:49.340
was being planned.

01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:52.040
And the construction had begun,
the surveying had taken place,

01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:53.690
and so on.

01:11:53.690 --> 01:11:56.660
And the Chinese
government had gotten

01:11:56.660 --> 01:12:00.020
billions of dollars
of funding from not

01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:03.650
just the Western governments,
not just IMF and World Bank,

01:12:03.650 --> 01:12:06.020
but also Morgan Stanley
and other investment banks

01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:07.830
and so on.

01:12:07.830 --> 01:12:10.400
And there were of course
moments of protests

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:13.580
from local scientists and so
on, but nothing was-- no fuss

01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:17.330
was made until Dai Qing
wrote the book [INAUDIBLE],,

01:12:17.330 --> 01:12:20.000
which got translated
immediately.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.720
And by 1999, when the
Chinese government

01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:27.740
went for the second tranche
of its billions of dollars,

01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:30.470
none of these
governments, not the IMF,

01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:34.130
not the World Bank,
not even Morgan Stanley

01:12:34.130 --> 01:12:38.660
gave it the money because
it had been lobbied

01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:41.380
by environmental groups.

01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:43.850
Its shareholders had been
lobbied, right, and told

01:12:43.850 --> 01:12:45.780
to avoid this kind of thing.

01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:50.660
So I mean, you can see
how a small little stir

01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:54.770
can make a huge global
scale sort of activism.

01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:57.920
So it became much more expensive
for the Chinese government.

01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:00.170
And it's still a
very dicey project.

01:13:00.170 --> 01:13:04.010
They claim that the 2008
earthquake, as you've heard,

01:13:04.010 --> 01:13:06.350
was a consequence of the
settling of the reservoir,

01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:07.740
the final reservoir.

01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:10.700
And apparently [INAUDIBLE]
was telling people

01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:12.936
if you really go after
me, I'll tell people,

01:13:12.936 --> 01:13:14.810
I'll tell the world how
many people are still

01:13:14.810 --> 01:13:20.060
being resettled from the
Yangtze Valley and so on.

01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:21.980
Apparently that didn't happen.

01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:24.150
But this is happening all over.

01:13:24.150 --> 01:13:26.930
Suddenly, all over Southeast
Asia and the Mekong Delta,

01:13:26.930 --> 01:13:29.790
you know about Myitsone, the
Burmese [INAUDIBLE] thing

01:13:29.790 --> 01:13:34.130
that canceled-- was
canceled in 2011 and so on.

01:13:34.130 --> 01:13:36.170
And Yunnan of course
is the great cradle

01:13:36.170 --> 01:13:37.430
of all of these movements.

01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:39.740
And that Yunnan southeast
Asian connection

01:13:39.740 --> 01:13:44.240
is very interesting as a
transnational area of activism.

01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:48.731
So my final, I hope--

01:13:48.731 --> 01:13:49.230
yeah.

01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:54.830
So I think that's--

01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:57.860
so you have these two
different notions of sacrality

01:13:57.860 --> 01:14:00.410
that are beginning to sort
of come together in Yunnan

01:14:00.410 --> 01:14:02.330
in an unstable kind of way.

01:14:02.330 --> 01:14:06.080
One is the sort of religious
and-- well, actually two.

01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:08.570
One is the religious, the
other is local communities,

01:14:08.570 --> 01:14:11.990
marginal communities who have
a certain conception of nature

01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:13.010
around them.

01:14:13.010 --> 01:14:14.780
But the other is
the modern sector

01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:18.740
of civil society and
civic activism, which also

01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:20.600
includes a lot of scientists.

01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:25.550
And this is happening to the
idea of modern protection.

01:14:25.550 --> 01:14:28.020
And the best example
of this, of course,

01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:33.570
is the United Nations, a
common heritage of humankind.

01:14:33.570 --> 01:14:34.910
The protected regions, right?

01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:37.880
Legally, there are
160,000 legally

01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:41.370
protected areas in the world,
nationally and internationally,

01:14:41.370 --> 01:14:44.780
including about 1,000
World Heritage sites which

01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:46.130
are both cultural and natural.

01:14:46.130 --> 01:14:48.500
More of them are
about biodiversity.

01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:50.720
And it covers 12% of the
land area of the world.

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:52.670
By the way, this doesn't
include the oceans,

01:14:52.670 --> 01:14:54.920
where most of the strangling--
a lot of the strangling

01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:56.364
is taking place.

01:14:56.364 --> 01:14:58.030
And some studies have
shown that they've

01:14:58.030 --> 01:15:00.470
reduced rates of deforestation,
protected species,

01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:02.670
and conserved land and water.

01:15:02.670 --> 01:15:05.900
I like to call this a kind
of a modern sacrality.

01:15:05.900 --> 01:15:07.700
Because after all,
what is involved here?

01:15:07.700 --> 01:15:09.470
It's an inviolability, right?

01:15:09.470 --> 01:15:12.260
When you protect an area,
you're saying it's inviolable.

01:15:12.260 --> 01:15:14.060
And why is it inviolable?

01:15:14.060 --> 01:15:16.940
Because it arises from
the elemental earth

01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:19.250
to protect the
sources of life, which

01:15:19.250 --> 01:15:23.750
is after all what also religious
sacrality is often related to.

01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:25.610
So there, at least
partially the legacy

01:15:25.610 --> 01:15:29.690
of ecological spirituality
and ecological activism.

01:15:29.690 --> 01:15:31.700
National and global
legal institutions

01:15:31.700 --> 01:15:33.910
are beginning to
recognize these demands.

01:15:33.910 --> 01:15:36.620
And we have examples
of the Indian Supreme

01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:40.730
Court, who declared that
the Orissa Kondh where

01:15:40.730 --> 01:15:43.970
in fact the most bauxite mining
in the world takes place,

01:15:43.970 --> 01:15:46.610
is declared the sacred
site of the Kondh.

01:15:46.610 --> 01:15:48.890
And so no more mining
can happen there.

01:15:48.890 --> 01:15:50.790
This has, of course,
other types of problems.

01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:53.460
But it's a very
interesting development.

01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:56.450
And there was a rash of
other legal protections then

01:15:56.450 --> 01:15:58.580
that came about at
that point, especially

01:15:58.580 --> 01:16:02.830
with marginal groups, with
tribal communities, and so on.

01:16:02.830 --> 01:16:05.254
Yunnan also has the
sacred sites of--

01:16:05.254 --> 01:16:06.920
the history of that
is very interesting.

01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:08.770
We don't have time
to go into it.

01:16:08.770 --> 01:16:10.580
The tree pattern
and rivers of Yunnan

01:16:10.580 --> 01:16:14.580
protected areas, where activists
like Pei Shengji, Yu Xiaogang,

01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:18.350
and so on have created the
whole notion of sacred forests.

01:16:18.350 --> 01:16:21.030
So, OK.

01:16:21.030 --> 01:16:21.920
I don't think--

01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:27.080
I think my conclusions are
pretty evident from my talks.

01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:29.046
So I'll just stop here.

01:16:29.046 --> 01:16:29.992
Thank you very much.

01:16:29.992 --> 01:16:31.884
[APPLAUSE]

01:16:34.730 --> 01:16:37.160
I leave you with this world
map with total percentage

01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:40.231
of each country and their
natural protection, yeah.

01:16:40.231 --> 01:16:40.980
Thank you so much.

01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:41.820
You're welcome.

01:16:41.820 --> 01:16:44.000
I took a long time.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.580
Well, it's important material.

01:16:45.580 --> 01:16:47.360
And is this my glass?

01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:48.010
I have one.

01:16:48.010 --> 01:16:49.450
This one might be yours, sorry.

01:16:49.450 --> 01:16:51.550
Yes, OK.

01:16:51.550 --> 01:16:54.170
So we are on a
truncated schedule

01:16:54.170 --> 01:16:57.500
for complicated reasons
having to do with room booking

01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:58.100
and so on.

01:16:58.100 --> 01:17:00.410
Far more detail
than you all need.

01:17:00.410 --> 01:17:02.960
But we will be on a--

01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:05.790
coming to a rather abrupt end.

01:17:05.790 --> 01:17:09.340
And we'll need to vacate the
room in about 20 minutes.

01:17:09.340 --> 01:17:12.950
So in order to move with
alacrity into the Q&amp;A,

01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:16.130
I'd like to introduce
Michael and ask Michael

01:17:16.130 --> 01:17:17.300
to begin the discussion.

01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:20.510
And then after that, we'll
open to the floor to questions

01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:23.400
and comments such
as time allows.

01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:26.090
And come to light.

01:17:26.090 --> 01:17:27.860
Without further ado, Michael.

01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:28.486
Wonderful.

01:17:28.486 --> 01:17:30.860
I will be very brief, because
I do want to open things up

01:17:30.860 --> 01:17:31.800
for discussion.

01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:33.050
But let me just say thank you.

01:17:33.050 --> 01:17:34.560
That was extraordinary.

01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:37.080
It is both extraordinary in
terms of-- all of your works

01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:40.670
is breathtaking in It's
re-conceptualization of world

01:17:40.670 --> 01:17:43.149
history and just the amount
of material you bring in.

01:17:43.149 --> 01:17:44.690
But thank you for
another reason too,

01:17:44.690 --> 01:17:48.080
because it's also equally
true of all of your work,

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:51.440
but now with such an
important implication,

01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:52.490
it's really inspiring.

01:17:52.490 --> 01:17:54.200
I mean, it's one
of the few talks

01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:58.010
I think I've ever heard on
the crisis where you come away

01:17:58.010 --> 01:18:00.982
thinking there is hope,
and not just because--

01:18:00.982 --> 01:18:01.940
I'm always [INAUDIBLE].

01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:04.096
Cup is always half-full for me.

01:18:04.096 --> 01:18:04.900
Indeed.

01:18:04.900 --> 01:18:07.400
And not just in the rah rah
sense, we can really do this,

01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:09.650
with a real sense of-- no,
no, no, there are actually

01:18:09.650 --> 01:18:10.940
are movements going on.

01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:12.500
There really are possibilities.

01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:16.460
And what seems at the moment
like a completely overwhelming

01:18:16.460 --> 01:18:19.500
danger facing us,
your argument is still

01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:22.470
that's part and parcel
of the dangerous ways we

01:18:22.470 --> 01:18:24.576
are conceptualizing it,
and the dangerous ways

01:18:24.576 --> 01:18:27.200
we're conceptualizing our point
and parcel of what is going on.

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:27.550
That's good.

01:18:27.550 --> 01:18:29.170
And if we actually
answer all of this--

01:18:29.170 --> 01:18:29.890
I better write that down.

01:18:29.890 --> 01:18:31.700
--it ends up it
opens up everything.

01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:32.450
So thank you.

01:18:32.450 --> 01:18:34.790
Thank you for both the
brilliant re-conceptualization

01:18:34.790 --> 01:18:37.850
and the feeling,
convincingly so,

01:18:37.850 --> 01:18:41.890
of these possibilities
that are actually emerging.

01:18:41.890 --> 01:18:42.451
So thank you.

01:18:42.451 --> 01:18:42.950
Thank you.

01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:43.449
Welcome.

01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:47.360
Thank you very much for that.

01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:48.980
I have many questions.

01:18:48.980 --> 01:18:50.807
I'd love to ask about
Shinto, for example,

01:18:50.807 --> 01:18:52.640
but we'll have other
opportunities for that.

01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:55.280
What I'd like to do
in order to recognize

01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:58.130
all of you who have come is
open the floor to questions.

01:18:58.130 --> 01:19:00.080
And please raise
your hand, and let

01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:02.520
us know who you are
as we move ahead.

01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:04.750
Let's come right back here.

01:19:04.750 --> 01:19:06.066
Go ahead.

01:19:06.066 --> 01:19:09.590
I'm Catherine [INAUDIBLE] I'm
the president of Cambridge

01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:14.030
and have been to
China many times.

01:19:14.030 --> 01:19:21.620
Often in the United States, when
we have an environmental issue

01:19:21.620 --> 01:19:27.800
that has been caused, probably
maybe by manufacturing

01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:32.960
and other things, the
push back and forth

01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:35.450
is not only for the environment.

01:19:35.450 --> 01:19:38.720
But people say, well, what
about the economic improvement

01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:42.230
of the people that are
benefiting by whatever

01:19:42.230 --> 01:19:44.690
this development is?

01:19:44.690 --> 01:19:47.720
So how do you tie the
two things together,

01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:53.840
the environmental protection
versus the movement

01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:56.980
forward to people to bettering
their economic standing?

01:20:00.042 --> 01:20:01.740
Should I answer
now, or take it--

01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:02.620
Oh sure, absolutely.

01:20:02.620 --> 01:20:08.020
Well, I did try to address
it in Tim Jackson's view,

01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:09.970
but of course that's
not an immediate view.

01:20:09.970 --> 01:20:11.440
That's the long term view.

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:19.550
And I don't have a
program for action here.

01:20:19.550 --> 01:20:22.930
I do have a scholarly
view that in the agenda

01:20:22.930 --> 01:20:25.580
of environmental
humanities, what I argue

01:20:25.580 --> 01:20:29.150
is that we should still
be looking into issues.

01:20:29.150 --> 01:20:31.190
The traditional
pillars and categories

01:20:31.190 --> 01:20:38.630
of environmental studies
is adaptation, mitigation,

01:20:38.630 --> 01:20:42.020
political ecology, and
so on, to show who gains

01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:45.320
and who benefits by certain
environmental moves,

01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:48.560
and how the poor are often
left out of that, right?

01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:51.320
So to some extent,
you can address it

01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:57.170
through an ecologically
informed economic study,

01:20:57.170 --> 01:21:00.290
right, to address the
questions of poverty.

01:21:00.290 --> 01:21:03.620
Of course, there
are policy people

01:21:03.620 --> 01:21:06.870
who say that you can just do
what the Chinese are doing.

01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:09.140
The positive side of what
the Chinese are doing,

01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:13.040
is just build a lot of renewable
energy structures and so

01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:16.460
on that will generate
employment and so on too.

01:21:16.460 --> 01:21:20.240
But ultimately, I think we
have to move to the Tim Jackson

01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:24.380
argument, which is that we
have to get rid of the idea

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:31.430
that wealth and economics
is related only to greater

01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:33.100
and greater production.

01:21:33.100 --> 01:21:35.960
That there has to be a
diversity of goals and values

01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:40.340
of what we think of as
prosperity, including

01:21:40.340 --> 01:21:44.090
the ways you use your time,
the kinds of activities

01:21:44.090 --> 01:21:45.660
you do with that, and so on.

01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:49.280
So I have a
three-pronged answer.

01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:51.650
I don't know if
it's satisfactory.

01:21:51.650 --> 01:21:54.060
Yeah, I think Bill
had a question.

01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:54.930
Yeah, over here.

01:21:54.930 --> 01:21:57.782
[INAUDIBLE] thank you
for a wonderful talk,

01:21:57.782 --> 01:21:59.620
and for a wonderful book.

01:21:59.620 --> 01:22:00.120
Thank you.

01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:09.530
And it's just wonderful to
have even an iota of optimism

01:22:09.530 --> 01:22:11.437
in the world on these issues.

01:22:11.437 --> 01:22:12.270
On almost any issue.

01:22:12.270 --> 01:22:15.390
[INAUDIBLE] from off the cuff.

01:22:15.390 --> 01:22:16.920
On the China front,
I guess I want

01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:18.420
to press you just
a little bit more,

01:22:18.420 --> 01:22:22.440
because I think Taiwan
is an example of what

01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:24.600
can happen obviously in
a Chinese cultural area.

01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:26.850
There are a variety
and extraordinary--

01:22:26.850 --> 01:22:29.820
Tsuji and other
organizations have

01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:31.080
been extraordinarily helpful.

01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:34.470
Having an opposition party
that is a Green Party also

01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:35.900
has something to do with it.

01:22:35.900 --> 01:22:36.526
But it in our--

01:22:36.526 --> 01:22:37.400
Of course, of course.

01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:39.840
-- own lifetime, since the
time when you and I as graduate

01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:41.840
students were in Taiwan,
we've seen the physical

01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:43.290
transformation of
this landscape.

01:22:43.290 --> 01:22:44.100
Absolutely.

01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:47.070
On the mainland by contrast,
you have obviously things

01:22:47.070 --> 01:22:48.690
in a quite different way.

01:22:48.690 --> 01:22:51.390
But the area, if I
were to think of where

01:22:51.390 --> 01:22:53.940
I would be optimistic of
where that would head,

01:22:53.940 --> 01:22:57.450
it's actually sadly not
because of civil society,

01:22:57.450 --> 01:23:03.780
or because of local activists
in Yunnan, or whatever.

01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:08.580
It would be because of a kind of
relentless engineering on top,

01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:11.740
or the guy who really turned
the Ministry of Engineering,

01:23:11.740 --> 01:23:14.170
I'm sorry, of environmental
protection around.

01:23:14.170 --> 01:23:17.310
[INAUDIBLE],, former
president of [INAUDIBLE]..

01:23:17.310 --> 01:23:20.400
You now have a
relentless crackdown

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:23.420
on coal-fired
power plants and so

01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:27.000
on all across the country
in terms of production.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.030
One size fits all.

01:23:29.030 --> 01:23:31.380
And my guess is that
this is going to,

01:23:31.380 --> 01:23:33.090
to the degree that
this happens, will

01:23:33.090 --> 01:23:37.080
make a dent and a difference
faster almost than anything

01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:37.830
else.

01:23:37.830 --> 01:23:41.430
But the civil
society part, which

01:23:41.430 --> 01:23:44.430
is the truly optimistic one
if this is a global movement,

01:23:44.430 --> 01:23:49.860
how do you see this in a
world governed by Xi Jinping

01:23:49.860 --> 01:23:52.200
Souchong?

01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:55.560
And in a world in which civil
society, and particularly

01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:58.860
religious affiliated
civil society,

01:23:58.860 --> 01:24:00.120
is under such pressure.

01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:03.120
Last thing I'll say, I
remember when he came to power.

01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:06.412
A friend of mine, a Buddhist,
said to me, don't worry.

01:24:06.412 --> 01:24:07.620
Don't worry about Xi Jinping.

01:24:07.620 --> 01:24:09.980
He's secretly a Buddhist.

01:24:09.980 --> 01:24:11.646
He's going to bring
the Dalai Lama back.

01:24:11.646 --> 01:24:12.340
[INAUDIBLE]

01:24:12.340 --> 01:24:17.500
So give me some
hope on that front.

01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:21.360
Well, I think that we
are not yet in a position

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:23.700
to say that civil
society will develop,

01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:25.440
will flourish in
China or something,

01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:27.600
but I think it does play a role.

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:29.970
And while there is
a huge crackdown

01:24:29.970 --> 01:24:33.490
as well under Jinping, I'm not
sure it is happening so much

01:24:33.490 --> 01:24:34.740
in the environment over there.

01:24:34.740 --> 01:24:37.990
I haven't followed the
contemporary scene that much.

01:24:37.990 --> 01:24:40.440
But certainly there
are still all kinds

01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:42.420
of protests that are going on.

01:24:42.420 --> 01:24:45.960
I mean, not environmentally
related, but land related.

01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:50.340
And I think that is an
important dimension of it,

01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:52.740
because when you control
the land, I mean,

01:24:52.740 --> 01:24:54.420
you can sell it
off or something.

01:24:54.420 --> 01:24:57.330
But right now, with
the property situation,

01:24:57.330 --> 01:25:01.410
people still have, in most parts
of China, a share to the land.

01:25:01.410 --> 01:25:05.860
And they're recognizing that
they cannot let that go easily,

01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:06.360
right?

01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:07.901
In some parts of
South China, they're

01:25:07.901 --> 01:25:10.710
being transformed into
cities and so on or whatever,

01:25:10.710 --> 01:25:14.200
semi-urban residential things.

01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:18.750
But I think there are forces
in society, not civil society

01:25:18.750 --> 01:25:23.220
forces, but forces in society
that have not angled it

01:25:23.220 --> 01:25:25.650
necessarily in an
environmental direction

01:25:25.650 --> 01:25:27.360
but in a land
direction, which I think

01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:28.930
is an important component.

01:25:28.930 --> 01:25:30.660
So that's the very
long and slow,

01:25:30.660 --> 01:25:31.990
but you're absolutely right.

01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:33.720
This is the biggest challenge.

01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:39.690
And I do think-- and Jinping
is working on the gamble,

01:25:39.690 --> 01:25:43.140
on the bet, the wager
that just having

01:25:43.140 --> 01:25:47.310
a lot of renewable energy
will do a lot of good stuff.

01:25:47.310 --> 01:25:50.280
And a lot of engineering
technical stuff

01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:53.220
that they're doing as well,
and with rivers and so

01:25:53.220 --> 01:25:57.580
on, though I think that is
going to be another disaster.

01:25:57.580 --> 01:25:59.620
These are these big projects.

01:25:59.620 --> 01:26:04.860
So I think it really is
also rural urban becoming

01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:07.290
increasingly-- not only
east coastal thing,

01:26:07.290 --> 01:26:11.400
but a rural urban thing where
you can see contamination where

01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:13.560
you cannot, right?

01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:14.920
This is a global problem.

01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:18.600
But it's even bigger in China,
because it's that much more

01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:21.645
difficult to see
in those places.

01:26:21.645 --> 01:26:23.520
But I don't have a good
answer, you're right.

01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:28.080
That is a global
weakness at this point.

01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:30.120
Though I'd be interested
in other views,

01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:33.630
if people are more optimistic
about Xi's top-down approach.

01:26:36.450 --> 01:26:37.570
I have a question here.

01:26:37.570 --> 01:26:38.790
I have a number of questions.

01:26:38.790 --> 01:26:40.579
And we'll move--
we'll move through.

01:26:40.579 --> 01:26:41.620
That's fine, that's fine.

01:26:41.620 --> 01:26:43.980
Robin will be next on the--

01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:44.480
OK.

01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:46.240
[INAUDIBLE]

01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:48.410
The mic, the baton.

01:26:48.410 --> 01:26:50.170
So, I'm disheartened,
as someone who

01:26:50.170 --> 01:26:53.380
spent half his professional
life in energy efficiency,

01:26:53.380 --> 01:26:56.230
and the other half
in renewable energy.

01:26:56.230 --> 01:26:57.130
And have a deep--

01:26:57.130 --> 01:26:58.570
I'm sorry, you are, sir?

01:26:58.570 --> 01:27:00.060
I'm George Wood.

01:27:00.060 --> 01:27:00.940
OK.

01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:07.180
And a deep abiding commitment
to the environment.

01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:11.030
I still-- and know the
results in New England

01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:14.740
and the US of these efforts,
and the huge mountain

01:27:14.740 --> 01:27:20.990
that we have to climb in
this country and New England.

01:27:20.990 --> 01:27:26.120
I've sought, and your
talk speaks to me,

01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:30.080
to something that's much
bigger and more powerful.

01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:35.220
And that is to connect with
people's spiritual belief.

01:27:35.220 --> 01:27:38.780
And having read the
encyclical three times--

01:27:38.780 --> 01:27:39.690
Oh, you have?

01:27:39.690 --> 01:27:44.070
--and he speaks both to
the anger that a lot of us

01:27:44.070 --> 01:27:48.000
feel in environmental
movement, to the hope,

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.490
but also to something you
spoke of in your speech,

01:27:50.490 --> 01:27:52.410
and that is the divine.

01:27:52.410 --> 01:27:57.150
And from me, and I would
love to hear your thoughts,

01:27:57.150 --> 01:27:58.530
how do you--

01:27:58.530 --> 01:28:01.000
has a much bigger
global view than

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:04.800
I do, rather New
Englanders, how--

01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:06.550
New England is the world.

01:28:06.550 --> 01:28:09.285
How do we as people and--

01:28:12.070 --> 01:28:17.960
get more people like
the pope to proselytize

01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:23.210
about the divinity in
nature, and I think, change

01:28:23.210 --> 01:28:25.180
from within, right?

01:28:25.180 --> 01:28:26.030
The spirit.

01:28:26.030 --> 01:28:28.970
And I think that's part of
what you're speaking to,

01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:30.320
but that to me--

01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:33.010
I know all the
technical solutions.

01:28:33.010 --> 01:28:37.220
I see the actual
practical picture.

01:28:37.220 --> 01:28:40.870
But I think the real movement
is what you're speaking to,

01:28:40.870 --> 01:28:42.502
and that's to connect
with the divine.

01:28:42.502 --> 01:28:43.960
Well, I'm glad you
brought that up,

01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:46.470
because I don't think
I mentioned this.

01:28:46.470 --> 01:28:49.210
Precisely at the time when we
were in Cambodia doing this,

01:28:49.210 --> 01:28:53.380
or maybe a little earlier,
there was an event in Oslo

01:28:53.380 --> 01:28:55.400
that I went to last month.

01:28:55.400 --> 01:28:57.660
They gave me a
Honorary Doctorate.

01:28:57.660 --> 01:29:02.870
But which was a very interesting
event, and the people

01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:04.880
in Cambodia alerted me to it.

01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:09.740
It was an interfaith rain
forest movement event.

01:29:09.740 --> 01:29:11.960
So the pope sent his
representative, direct

01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:13.340
representative.

01:29:13.340 --> 01:29:17.300
People from all-- many
African, Latin American, Asian

01:29:17.300 --> 01:29:20.870
societies, as well as, of
course, Europeans and Americans

01:29:20.870 --> 01:29:21.590
attended that.

01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:26.060
It was a huge event
supported by the rain forest

01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:28.340
initiative in Oslo.

01:29:28.340 --> 01:29:30.650
By the way, Norway is
spending more money

01:29:30.650 --> 01:29:34.450
than any other for
global ecological.

01:29:34.450 --> 01:29:40.190
They also got the most
oil, so there is--

01:29:40.190 --> 01:29:42.690
but they're also into
renewable energy.

01:29:42.690 --> 01:29:46.650
They are spending
it at least too.

01:29:46.650 --> 01:29:48.790
And this was a very
important event,

01:29:48.790 --> 01:29:52.940
because the statement of it
says that rain forests are

01:29:52.940 --> 01:29:56.530
the principle carbon
sinks in the world.

01:29:56.530 --> 01:30:00.730
And the indigenous people
who inhabit those areas

01:30:00.730 --> 01:30:03.310
are the ones who
are suffering most.

01:30:03.310 --> 01:30:07.510
And it is the duty of the world,
the religions of the world,

01:30:07.510 --> 01:30:09.670
to protect those areas.

01:30:09.670 --> 01:30:13.150
And it even mentions
who are the ones who

01:30:13.150 --> 01:30:14.830
are devastating it, right?

01:30:14.830 --> 01:30:18.360
Not personally, but industries.

01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:20.690
So I thought it was-- and
the pope had a very important

01:30:20.690 --> 01:30:22.100
representative.

01:30:22.100 --> 01:30:24.470
The Dalai Lama sent his.

01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:27.710
There were many Chinese
groups, Buddhist groups.

01:30:27.710 --> 01:30:29.030
There were many Hindu groups.

01:30:29.030 --> 01:30:32.370
There were many
Muslim groups as well.

01:30:32.370 --> 01:30:36.830
So if you're interested,
I can send you the link.

01:30:36.830 --> 01:30:39.920
There's a huge sort
of reports on it.

01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:43.250
And they are now going ahead.

01:30:43.250 --> 01:30:46.040
I don't know their program of
action, but it's been set up.

01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:47.150
And it's a recognition.

01:30:47.150 --> 01:30:51.980
Again, like COP 21, it's
a kind of a landmark,

01:30:51.980 --> 01:30:55.910
I think, in many ways
for this kind of change.

01:30:55.910 --> 01:31:01.160
It's a spiritual
attention to it.

01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:02.860
Let's see what happens.

01:31:02.860 --> 01:31:06.400
There are always many
good developments

01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:10.290
that we can feel
optimistic about.

01:31:10.290 --> 01:31:13.610
We'd like to come up here, and
we'll begin with a young woman

01:31:13.610 --> 01:31:18.180
and then, given time,
we'll move down the line.

01:31:18.180 --> 01:31:18.690
Thank you.

01:31:18.690 --> 01:31:22.329
Thank you for your
wonderful talk.

01:31:22.329 --> 01:31:23.370
Please tell us your name.

01:31:23.370 --> 01:31:24.330
Oh, sorry.

01:31:24.330 --> 01:31:27.450
So I'm [INAUDIBLE]
from Boston University.

01:31:27.450 --> 01:31:28.900
I'm from China.

01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:32.310
So it's interesting to
see that you connect

01:31:32.310 --> 01:31:35.790
these ecological thinking
or movement to Taoism

01:31:35.790 --> 01:31:38.070
or Confucianism.

01:31:38.070 --> 01:31:41.080
But it's a little
bit awkward for me

01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:45.900
to say that this is not
ecological thinking.

01:31:45.900 --> 01:31:49.260
It's kind of
spiritual or religion,

01:31:49.260 --> 01:31:52.530
because China is kind of
secular society, right?

01:31:52.530 --> 01:31:55.830
Because of communism.

01:31:55.830 --> 01:31:57.910
So I grew up in China.

01:31:57.910 --> 01:32:00.570
So it took me some time
to understand what is

01:32:00.570 --> 01:32:02.830
religion when I came to the US.

01:32:02.830 --> 01:32:06.090
And according to my
understanding, so transcendence

01:32:06.090 --> 01:32:11.570
or sacred, right, it's much
about the afterlife, or not

01:32:11.570 --> 01:32:15.960
the world, which is not
this current world, right?

01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:20.040
So, but this ecological
thinking or movement

01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:23.070
concerns very much
about the current world.

01:32:23.070 --> 01:32:27.150
And the thing is that, I
think, I wonder whether we

01:32:27.150 --> 01:32:30.220
can argue things only
the other way around,

01:32:30.220 --> 01:32:31.440
is that instead of the--

01:32:33.990 --> 01:32:35.180
Sacred.

01:32:35.180 --> 01:32:39.020
--one to make this really
the ecological thinking

01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:39.870
as a religion, ?

01:32:39.870 --> 01:32:47.940
Right I wonder it is a
secularly usage of religion

01:32:47.940 --> 01:32:49.650
in our secular life, right?

01:32:49.650 --> 01:32:51.870
That actually makes more
sense for me, instead

01:32:51.870 --> 01:32:57.930
of making it as a
spirituality or religion.

01:32:57.930 --> 01:33:00.500
And it--

01:33:00.500 --> 01:33:01.130
OK.

01:33:01.130 --> 01:33:05.820
So that also bring me about your
interpretation, about the word,

01:33:05.820 --> 01:33:07.100
[INAUDIBLE].

01:33:07.100 --> 01:33:09.530
So, the interpretation
of the word [INAUDIBLE]

01:33:09.530 --> 01:33:12.169
is more as homeland, right?

01:33:12.169 --> 01:33:12.710
Yeah, I know.

01:33:12.710 --> 01:33:15.530
And then so I don't understand
why you translate it

01:33:15.530 --> 01:33:18.600
as sacred land.

01:33:18.600 --> 01:33:19.100
No, no.

01:33:19.100 --> 01:33:21.260
I didn't translate
it as sacred land.

01:33:21.260 --> 01:33:24.770
I mean, I added that
as another category.

01:33:24.770 --> 01:33:26.400
It was not a translation.

01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:30.440
Well [? shangto ?] is,
for instance, it's the--

01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:34.910
very interestingly, as
Bill knows very well,

01:33:34.910 --> 01:33:42.820
the most important pre-war
environment regimes

01:33:42.820 --> 01:33:44.330
were the Nazis, right?

01:33:44.330 --> 01:33:46.450
At least in the early phases.

01:33:46.450 --> 01:33:50.530
And the most important concept
for their environmentalism

01:33:50.530 --> 01:33:52.520
and for their
political ideology was

01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:56.230
heimat, which is homeland,
which is what [? shangto ?] is.

01:33:56.230 --> 01:33:58.990
I mean, the Japanese Kyoto,
Chinese [? shangto ?]

01:33:58.990 --> 01:34:02.080
is really using
the German concept

01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:09.190
with all its metaphysical
and originary dimensions.

01:34:09.190 --> 01:34:13.240
Of course, changed as it
circulates in different parts.

01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:17.260
But in Yunnan, this thing has
started again, [? shangto. ?]

01:34:17.260 --> 01:34:22.100
And that is to say, these
environmental groups in Yunnan

01:34:22.100 --> 01:34:25.850
are saying that children who
get environmental education

01:34:25.850 --> 01:34:28.730
in the school, just
they're not interested.

01:34:28.730 --> 01:34:32.260
They are-- it's just
something they have to do.

01:34:32.260 --> 01:34:35.860
Whereas if you involve
in the local communities,

01:34:35.860 --> 01:34:39.790
in their [? shangto, ?] and get
them to see invasive species,

01:34:39.790 --> 01:34:41.500
and which invasive
species are bad,

01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:44.500
this, that, have them do
projects outside and so,

01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:45.760
it has much greater effect.

01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:48.230
It affects them
spiritually as well, right?

01:34:48.230 --> 01:34:49.201
So in that sense.

01:34:49.201 --> 01:34:51.700
Now, to come back to your first
part of your question, which

01:34:51.700 --> 01:34:53.860
is that you're
saying that it's more

01:34:53.860 --> 01:34:56.050
that religion is being
instrumentalized,

01:34:56.050 --> 01:34:57.940
used instrumentally.

01:34:57.940 --> 01:34:59.920
I would rather not
think of it that way.

01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:03.430
I think the concept
that I want to use

01:35:03.430 --> 01:35:05.032
is really pertinence, right?

01:35:05.032 --> 01:35:06.740
This is the idea I
was trying to develop.

01:35:06.740 --> 01:35:09.280
What is the pertinence
between something

01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:11.230
that had or may have
had other motives,

01:35:11.230 --> 01:35:12.670
but have those qualities?

01:35:12.670 --> 01:35:14.350
And what is the new project?

01:35:14.350 --> 01:35:17.080
So I would rather not
instrumentalize it,

01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:19.300
because it has many
creative possibilities.

01:35:19.300 --> 01:35:22.651
It's not just being used for
that one instrumental purpose,

01:35:22.651 --> 01:35:23.150
right?

01:35:27.370 --> 01:35:30.410
We cannot transcend
time and the clock.

01:35:30.410 --> 01:35:31.350
And I am--

01:35:31.350 --> 01:35:31.820
We are in linear time.

01:35:31.820 --> 01:35:32.778
--deeply, deeply sorry.

01:35:32.778 --> 01:35:36.400
But so grateful for a rich
talk that has filled our time,

01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:37.433
and filled our evening.

01:35:37.433 --> 01:35:38.600
Thank you, thank you.

01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:41.350
Thank you for your comments.
