00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.490
Electronics keep getting smaller, and it’s
all thanks to electric switches called transistors.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.769
When these little fellas replaced vacuum tubes,
computers went from the size of entire rooms

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.799
to merely the corner of a room.

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.650
In the 60-odd years since, transistors have
kept shrinking, scaling down and powering

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.340
up our electronics with them.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.920
But many think we are hitting a choke point…
what if we can’t make anything smaller?!

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.050
Transistors have 3 terminals, a source, a
drain, and a gate.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.489
Current flows from the source and, if the
gate allows the electrons to pass, out the

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.489
drain.

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.260
You know how computer code is ones and zeros
at its most fundamental level?

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.500
Well, this is where that physically happens.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.719
Current flowing through an open gate represents
a one, a closed gate and no current represents

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:43.719
a zero.

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:47.999
Pack thousands of these transistors together
and they can do calculations and act as a

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:50.089
computer’s brain.

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:54.391
Early computers had thousands of transistors,
but one way to build a better brain is to

00:00:54.391 --> 00:00:59.840
squeeze more transistors onto a chip, and
today’s chips could have billions.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.860
That means scaling all the parts of a transistor
down.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.930
Not only do smaller transistors allow for
a higher density, but it also means they can

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.000
switch from on to off faster, so small is
good!

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.720
Right now, commercially available chips typically
have transistors with gates about 14 to 20

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.460
nm across, depending on the chip.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.920
The problem is, as gates get thinner, quantum
mechanics (the physics that govern tiny parts

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.400
of atoms) start to come into play.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.690
For example, if the gates are too thin then
they won’t be able to stop electrons because

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.070
the electrons will tunnel through.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.390
Not in a literal sense, they don’t bore
through the gate like an escaped convict.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.680
They tunnel in the quirky quantum sense, where
essentially electrons disappear on one side

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.840
of the gate and reappear on the other.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.480
Eat your heart out, Andy Dufresne.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:50.210
If the gate is supposed to be closed to current
- meaning a zero - and it ain’t, that’s

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.630
a big problem.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.880
Researchers predict that the lower limit for
silicon gate is 5 nm, and by 2021 it won’t

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.980
be economically efficient to keep shrinking
transistors.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:05.090
So, where do we go when the laws of physics
stop the march of technological progress?

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.399
Well, the good news is, there are other ways
of improving performance.

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.469
Machine learning could help develop more efficient
algorithms to use with current transistors.

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:17.090
Or, we could switch to light based computers
with optical gates.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.620
That, could actually boost performance 20
fold, though the hardware is a bit larger.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.709
Or, we could stop using silicon.

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.150
Researchers have managed to make a transistor
out of molybdenum disulfide with a carbon

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.879
nanotube gate thats just one nanometer across.

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:36.249
It gets around electron tunneling because
electrons don’t flow as fast through the

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:38.620
molybdenum disulfide as they do through silicon.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.819
But, mass production would probably be expensive,
it was hard enough to make the proof of concept.

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.310
The point is, progress can happen even if
we can’t shrink.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.359
Keep in mind when transistors were first used
in a computer they were 20 times more expensive

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:52.730
than vacuum tubes.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.629
Even though transistors were much costlier,
computer scientists knew they had more of

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.670
an upside in the long run, and look where
that led us!

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.060
...Watching cat videos on your phone while
you avoid eye contact on your commute to work.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.060

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:48.659
Moore’s law and the whole new chip design they're proposing.

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:52.819
Fun Fact: The first point-contact transistor
was invented in 1947, and it was made from

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.189
strips of gold foil, a plastic triangle, then
pushed down on a germanium crystal.

00:03:57.189 --> 00:03:59.629
