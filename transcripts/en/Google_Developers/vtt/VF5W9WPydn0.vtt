00:00:08.957 --> 00:00:11.858
Welcome to our project
Google Developers Hackademy,

00:00:11.858 --> 00:00:15.627
where Spanish-speaking experts
from Latin America

00:00:15.627 --> 00:00:18.231
will show you
some of our tools,

00:00:18.231 --> 00:00:21.726
developerâ€™s products,
APIs and new tricks.

00:00:21.726 --> 00:00:23.990
This course is divided
into five parts.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.528
We invite you to watch it
and learn along.

00:00:26.528 --> 00:00:27.528
Let's start.

00:00:34.561 --> 00:00:37.561
Hello. Welcome to the HTML5
web develop

00:00:37.561 --> 00:00:39.726
introduction course
with Google Drive.

00:00:39.726 --> 00:00:41.957
My name is
Cesar Anton Dorantes,

00:00:41.957 --> 00:00:45.330
Google Developer Expert
for the Google Drive platform.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.990
In this lesson we will see
the following subjects:

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.759
HTML5 document structure;

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:54.462
document structure
in HTML5 applications;

00:00:54.462 --> 00:00:57.924
free web hosting using
Google Drive Public Folders;

00:00:57.924 --> 00:01:00.594
automatic synchronization
with Google Drive;

00:01:00.594 --> 00:01:01.792
and, finally,

00:01:01.792 --> 00:01:04.924
a practice in which we'll
build an HTML5 website.

00:01:05.363 --> 00:01:06.561
Are you ready?

00:01:06.561 --> 00:01:08.099
Let's get it started!

00:01:09.462 --> 00:01:11.198
HTML5 DOCUMENT STRUCTURE

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.561
HTML5 presents
a different approach

00:01:14.561 --> 00:01:16.165
than the previous versions.

00:01:16.165 --> 00:01:18.627
Now it emphasizes
on maintaining

00:01:18.627 --> 00:01:20.660
a clear and simple structure.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.363
Today we use HTML mainly

00:01:23.363 --> 00:01:26.396
to describe the order
and structure of our app.

00:01:26.396 --> 00:01:28.792
The logic,
written in JavaScript,

00:01:28.792 --> 00:01:31.561
and the visual details,
written in CSS,

00:01:31.561 --> 00:01:34.132
are kept apart
and we'll talk about them

00:01:34.132 --> 00:01:35.594
in a lesson later on.

00:01:35.594 --> 00:01:38.132
HTML5 has
a very semantic structure

00:01:38.132 --> 00:01:40.297
and its labels
are very descriptive,

00:01:40.297 --> 00:01:43.099
which makes it easy for us
to declare and to edit

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:44.990
the structure
of our application.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.099
If you're familiarized
with HTML4,

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:49.990
you'll notice that everything
is much easier now.

00:01:50.462 --> 00:01:52.528
We start by declaring
the doctype,

00:01:52.528 --> 00:01:54.198
with has been shortened,

00:01:54.198 --> 00:01:56.759
making it easier to write
and remember,

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.429
since now you just need to
mention it's an HTML document.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.990
Now we put the HTML labels.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.693
These indicate where our code
starts and where it ends.

00:02:07.693 --> 00:02:10.759
Here we also declare what
language the document is in

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.363
by using the "lang" attribute

00:02:12.363 --> 00:02:14.330
and the corresponding
language code.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.561
In this case we use
the "es" code,

00:02:16.561 --> 00:02:18.693
since the document
is in Spanish.

00:02:18.693 --> 00:02:21.792
In this part we declare
the "head" and "body" tags.

00:02:21.792 --> 00:02:25.033
In "head" we place
the information we wish

00:02:25.033 --> 00:02:28.429
is only available for browsers
and search engines.

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:31.660
In "body" we place
the information we wish

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.660
the user can see
through the browser.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.363
Time to write the title
we wish to be shown

00:02:37.363 --> 00:02:39.693
on the browser
for our application.

00:02:39.693 --> 00:02:42.759
To do so, we write the title
within the "title" tag,

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:43.858
inside "head."

00:02:44.891 --> 00:02:47.627
Now let's place
some metatags to declare

00:02:47.627 --> 00:02:49.792
our page's basic information.

00:02:49.792 --> 00:02:52.858
We start with
our page's encoding

00:02:52.858 --> 00:02:55.066
inside the "charset" attribute.

00:02:55.066 --> 00:02:56.858
UTF-8 is recommended

00:02:56.858 --> 00:02:59.561
because it accepts accents
and letter "Ã±."

00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:02.165
By using the "name"
y "content" attributes

00:03:02.165 --> 00:03:04.990
we declare our page's
description and author.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.561
You can see I'm not using
the famous "keywords."

00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:11.198
Nowadays its use
is no longer recommended,

00:03:11.198 --> 00:03:13.561
because browsers don't
take them into account

00:03:13.561 --> 00:03:15.165
for the site's ranking anymore,

00:03:15.165 --> 00:03:18.429
and sometimes they can
even harm it.

00:03:18.429 --> 00:03:21.165
Time to start declaring
the content we wish

00:03:21.165 --> 00:03:23.264
to be shown in our application.

00:03:23.264 --> 00:03:25.132
Remember that in HTML5

00:03:25.132 --> 00:03:27.495
this is done inside
the "body" tag.

00:03:27.495 --> 00:03:30.330
It is recommended
that our page's main content

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.165
is indicated
inside the "article" tag.

00:03:33.165 --> 00:03:35.231
Let's write it in our code.

00:03:35.792 --> 00:03:38.099
Finally, let's place the content

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.825
we want to show inside "article"

00:03:40.825 --> 00:03:43.858
and that's it! We already have
an HTML5 app

00:03:43.858 --> 00:03:45.495
with all basic elements.

00:03:49.297 --> 00:03:51.792
It's very important
to keep the files

00:03:51.792 --> 00:03:54.066
in separate folders
according to their type.

00:03:54.066 --> 00:03:57.099
This will be very useful through
our project's development,

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:59.693
because it makes it easy
to find them and edit them.

00:03:59.693 --> 00:04:01.957
As well as declaring the routes

00:04:01.957 --> 00:04:04.231
to the different files
from the code,

00:04:04.231 --> 00:04:07.924
particularly when we're
working on big projects.

00:04:08.264 --> 00:04:11.726
The basic folders
for an HTML5 project are:

00:04:12.066 --> 00:04:13.330
"CSS:"

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.693
This is where we store
the files that determine

00:04:15.693 --> 00:04:17.792
the appearance
and visual effects.

00:04:17.792 --> 00:04:19.297
"HTML:"

00:04:19.297 --> 00:04:22.429
In this folder we put
the corresponding files

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:24.726
to each page of our project.

00:04:24.726 --> 00:04:25.924
"IMG:"

00:04:25.924 --> 00:04:29.198
This is where we keep
textures, photographs,

00:04:29.198 --> 00:04:32.231
logos and other images
we will use.

00:04:32.231 --> 00:04:34.594
It's very useful to coordinate
from the start

00:04:34.594 --> 00:04:37.792
with the Design team
on image names,

00:04:37.792 --> 00:04:41.759
this way they can add
or update elements

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:44.726
without having to wait
for the Development team.

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.264
"JS:"

00:04:46.264 --> 00:04:48.396
This is where
JavaScript files go,

00:04:48.396 --> 00:04:50.297
which we will use to define

00:04:50.297 --> 00:04:52.132
our application's behavior.

00:04:52.132 --> 00:04:54.693
The index.html file

00:04:54.693 --> 00:04:57.429
must always be placed
in the root directory,

00:04:57.429 --> 00:05:00.957
apart from the rest of
HTML files in our project.

00:05:00.957 --> 00:05:04.396
In this file we put
the welcoming page.

00:05:04.561 --> 00:05:06.363
This file structure

00:05:06.363 --> 00:05:09.231
is the same for pages
or web applications.

00:05:09.231 --> 00:05:10.693
Now that we have

00:05:10.693 --> 00:05:12.957
all the files
our project requires,

00:05:12.957 --> 00:05:15.462
it is ready
for the future of apps,

00:05:15.462 --> 00:05:18.990
which are HTML5
Packaged Apps.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.363
The main difference is
that a Packaged App

00:05:22.363 --> 00:05:24.528
contains a file
in the root directory

00:05:24.528 --> 00:05:26.165
called "Manifest,"

00:05:26.165 --> 00:05:28.792
and the user, instead
of downloading the data

00:05:28.792 --> 00:05:30.693
from the server each time,

00:05:30.693 --> 00:05:33.627
it is installed in the computer
as a regular app.

00:05:33.792 --> 00:05:38.165
It can even access the hardware
connected directly through USB,

00:05:38.165 --> 00:05:40.660
as with native applications.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.726
Nowadays we can find
this technology

00:05:43.726 --> 00:05:46.957
already in use in Windows 8,
BlackBerry 10

00:05:46.957 --> 00:05:48.990
and the new Firefox OS,

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.462
but it will very soon
be available

00:05:51.462 --> 00:05:53.660
in the Chrome Packaged Apps,

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.891
which will allow you to sell
your HTML5 apps

00:05:56.891 --> 00:05:58.429
from Chrome Store,

00:05:58.429 --> 00:06:01.066
which can be installed
in any device

00:06:01.066 --> 00:06:02.858
containing Google Chrome.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.132
FREE WEB HOSTING
USING PUBLIC FOLDERS

00:06:06.495 --> 00:06:08.957
A very powerful tool
from Google Drive

00:06:08.957 --> 00:06:10.462
for developers

00:06:10.462 --> 00:06:12.825
is the option of using
folders as hosting

00:06:12.825 --> 00:06:16.231
for both pages
and HTML5 apps for free

00:06:16.231 --> 00:06:18.495
and with no broadband
limitations.

00:06:18.495 --> 00:06:22.363
Nowadays, Google Drive
allows us to store up to 15 GB

00:06:22.363 --> 00:06:23.792
for free

00:06:23.792 --> 00:06:26.330
and has several
very economic packages

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.396
to rent additional space
if we need to.

00:06:29.396 --> 00:06:31.792
For those who own
a Chrome Book,

00:06:31.792 --> 00:06:33.957
Google gives them 100 GB

00:06:33.957 --> 00:06:36.495
of storing in Drive
for one year.

00:06:36.495 --> 00:06:39.132
In order to use a folder
as web hosting,

00:06:39.132 --> 00:06:41.231
just follow this easy steps.

00:06:41.495 --> 00:06:42.495
Step 1:

00:06:42.495 --> 00:06:45.759
Frist, we need to create
the folder we will use

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:47.594
to store our project

00:06:47.594 --> 00:06:49.792
from Google Drive's
web application.

00:06:49.792 --> 00:06:52.957
For this example we'll create
a folder called

00:06:52.957 --> 00:06:55.165
"Drive HTML hosting."

00:06:55.396 --> 00:06:56.759
Step 2:

00:06:57.132 --> 00:07:00.429
Now, we select the folder
we just created

00:07:00.429 --> 00:07:02.792
by right-clicking
with our mouse.

00:07:02.792 --> 00:07:04.495
We look for the option "Share"

00:07:04.495 --> 00:07:06.396
and we select "Share."

00:07:06.396 --> 00:07:07.462
Step 3:

00:07:07.462 --> 00:07:09.429
You'll notice a window
will appear

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:10.957
in which the sharing options
for this folder

00:07:10.957 --> 00:07:13.033
are shown.

00:07:13.033 --> 00:07:15.528
In this case, we need
to find the section

00:07:15.528 --> 00:07:17.165
"Who has access."

00:07:17.165 --> 00:07:19.792
By default, folders are private.

00:07:19.792 --> 00:07:21.495
In order to activate
the hosting,

00:07:21.495 --> 00:07:24.198
we need to turn the folder
into a public one.

00:07:24.198 --> 00:07:27.594
For that we first need
to click on "Change."

00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:29.330
Step 4:

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.462
The window "Sharing options"
will pop up.

00:07:32.462 --> 00:07:34.363
In "Visibility options,"

00:07:34.363 --> 00:07:37.363
we need to select the options
"Public in the Web"

00:07:37.363 --> 00:07:39.132
and click on "Save."

00:07:39.132 --> 00:07:42.198
This will send us back
to the previous display.

00:07:42.198 --> 00:07:44.825
Now we'll see the contents
of the folder

00:07:44.825 --> 00:07:47.066
are marked as
"Public in the Web."

00:07:47.066 --> 00:07:49.264
And that's it!,
We have now activated

00:07:49.264 --> 00:07:51.231
"Drive HTML hosting"

00:07:51.231 --> 00:07:53.297
for all files and subfolders

00:07:53.297 --> 00:07:55.066
we store in this folder.

00:07:55.066 --> 00:07:57.924
Let's click on "End"
to exit this display.

00:07:58.099 --> 00:07:59.297
Step 5:

00:07:59.297 --> 00:08:01.462
Now, we need to know the URL

00:08:01.462 --> 00:08:03.594
that was assigned
to our folder.

00:08:03.594 --> 00:08:06.957
In order to see it,
we right-click on the folder,

00:08:06.957 --> 00:08:10.363
but this time we pick
the option "Details."

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:12.561
If we did it correctly,

00:08:12.561 --> 00:08:14.924
we will see a new detail
has been added:

00:08:14.924 --> 00:08:16.198
"Storing."

00:08:16.198 --> 00:08:18.759
This address leads
to our folder

00:08:18.759 --> 00:08:21.165
but in a web page format.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:25.132
If the folder contains
a file named index.html,

00:08:25.132 --> 00:08:28.825
it will load it by default
when someone access it.

00:08:28.825 --> 00:08:30.066
Otherwise,

00:08:30.066 --> 00:08:32.462
it will show a list
with all the files

00:08:32.462 --> 00:08:34.297
contained in this folder,

00:08:34.297 --> 00:08:36.495
so we can also use it

00:08:36.495 --> 00:08:38.099
to easily share

00:08:38.099 --> 00:08:40.561
all its contents with the world.

00:08:40.561 --> 00:08:43.132
If it is a file Google Drive
can use,

00:08:43.132 --> 00:08:46.198
it will show its contents
directly in the browser.

00:08:46.198 --> 00:08:47.264
Otherwise,

00:08:47.264 --> 00:08:50.264
a download of the
selected file will start.

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:57.297
To profit from the benefits
of automatic synch,

00:08:57.297 --> 00:09:00.528
the first thing we got to do
is download the app

00:09:00.528 --> 00:09:02.363
"Google Drive for Desktop,"

00:09:02.363 --> 00:09:05.264
which is available
for Mac and Windows.

00:09:05.528 --> 00:09:07.528
Once installed, we need to wait

00:09:07.528 --> 00:09:11.429
for the synch of the files
in my unit to finish.

00:09:11.429 --> 00:09:14.132
The time it'll take
will depend on the size

00:09:14.132 --> 00:09:15.693
and on the amount of files,

00:09:15.693 --> 00:09:19.198
as well as on the speed
of our Internet connection.

00:09:19.198 --> 00:09:21.858
This will allow us to create
and edit files

00:09:21.858 --> 00:09:23.726
directly in our computer,

00:09:23.726 --> 00:09:26.132
which will keep synchronized
with the cloud,

00:09:26.132 --> 00:09:28.495
therefore, every time
we save a change,

00:09:28.495 --> 00:09:30.660
and this will be automatically

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:34.165
and almost instantly shown
in our page or application.

00:09:34.165 --> 00:09:36.792
Another great advantage
is that Google Drive

00:09:36.792 --> 00:09:39.429
allows us to share folders
with other users,

00:09:39.429 --> 00:09:42.924
which will keep synchronized
with their computers too,

00:09:42.924 --> 00:09:44.330
as long as they have

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.924
the Google Drive for Desktop
app installed.

00:09:46.924 --> 00:09:49.396
This facilitates teamwork
immensely.

00:09:49.396 --> 00:09:52.990
This is one of the most powerful
real-time collaboration tools

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:55.363
the Google Drive platform
has to offer.

00:09:57.726 --> 00:09:59.825
I invite you to watch
this lesson again,

00:09:59.825 --> 00:10:02.396
this time pausing it
to follow the steps

00:10:02.396 --> 00:10:04.495
and copy the code
that is shown.

00:10:04.495 --> 00:10:06.693
If you want to compare,
you can see an example

00:10:06.693 --> 00:10:09.099
on the website
that is shown on screen.

00:10:14.726 --> 00:10:16.990
That will be all for now.

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:20.132
See you next lesson:
"Introduction to Google Charts,"

00:10:20.132 --> 00:10:22.594
in which we'll learn,
among other things,

00:10:22.594 --> 00:10:25.495
how to do charts
for your HTML5 apps,

00:10:25.495 --> 00:10:27.891
and believe me,
you don't want to miss it.

00:10:27.891 --> 00:10:30.660
I say goodbye for now, guys,
and remember:

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:32.066
keep on programming!
