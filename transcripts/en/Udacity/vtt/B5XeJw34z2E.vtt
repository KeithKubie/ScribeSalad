00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.625
Beyond the functionality that a system provides exists certain

00:00:03.625 --> 00:00:05.520
non-functional qualities.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.790
These qualities are often crosscutting.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.750
What this means is that their implementation is often spread across

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.240
the entire system.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.810
For example, consider re-usability.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.050
It is not enough that one of a systems components is reusable,

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.720
it means that most of the components and

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.910
possible the application as a whole must be easily applicable in other contexts.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.460
Because of the crosscutting nature of non-functional qualities,

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.000
providing them often has a strong effect on the system's overall structure.
