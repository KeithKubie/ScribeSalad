the problem of aid effectiveness and how

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730
the problem of aid effectiveness and how

permanent fixture in so many developing
 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.670
permanent fixture in so many developing
countries and the ones where it's most

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680
countries and the ones where it's most
 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.390
countries and the ones where it's most
egregious is really the countries where

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400
egregious is really the countries where

taxation and overall domestic revenues

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769
taxation and overall domestic revenues
 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.460
taxation and overall domestic revenues
how much money the country collects in

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470
how much money the country collects in
 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.210
how much money the country collects in
revenues on its own is in the low double

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220
revenues on its own is in the low double
 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.580
revenues on its own is in the low double
digits for example especially in Africa

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590
digits for example especially in Africa
 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.209
digits for example especially in Africa
but also in Cambodia and as a result is

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219
but also in Cambodia and as a result is
 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.940
but also in Cambodia and as a result is
not able to finance its needs and so

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950
not able to finance its needs and so
 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.830
not able to finance its needs and so
brings in foreign aid to do that which

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840
brings in foreign aid to do that which
 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.450
brings in foreign aid to do that which
is the purpose of foreign aid but you

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460
is the purpose of foreign aid but you
 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.910
is the purpose of foreign aid but you
see if that continues forever then it

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920
see if that continues forever then it
 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.740
see if that continues forever then it
means the country is not really

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750
means the country is not really
 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.260
means the country is not really
collecting the resources needed for its

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270
collecting the resources needed for its
 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.290
collecting the resources needed for its
national development when you see

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300
national development when you see
 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.970
national development when you see
corruption being equal to the foreign

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980
corruption being equal to the foreign
 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.910
corruption being equal to the foreign
aid in magnitude you start wondering

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920
aid in magnitude you start wondering
 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.160
aid in magnitude you start wondering
what is exactly going on in the minds of

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170
what is exactly going on in the minds of
 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.880
what is exactly going on in the minds of
leaders and why they're not collecting

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890
leaders and why they're not collecting
 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.420
leaders and why they're not collecting
taxes and I've argued that there's a

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430
taxes and I've argued that there's a
 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.690
taxes and I've argued that there's a
relationship between taxation and

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700
relationship between taxation and
 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.679
relationship between taxation and
accountability especially if you're

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689
accountability especially if you're
 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.420
accountability especially if you're
trying to have a democracy because if

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430
trying to have a democracy because if
 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.429
trying to have a democracy because if
you're not taxing people then they're

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439
you're not taxing people then they're
 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.649
you're not taxing people then they're
not entitled to representation in your

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659
not entitled to representation in your
 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.260
not entitled to representation in your
mind or they don't pay your salary and

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270
mind or they don't pay your salary and
 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.570
mind or they don't pay your salary and
therefore not listening to them as a

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580
therefore not listening to them as a
 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.690
therefore not listening to them as a
result of all this so the the link

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700
result of all this so the the link
 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.550
result of all this so the the link
between taxation and accountability is

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560
between taxation and accountability is
 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.590
between taxation and accountability is
broken and democracy as a result is

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600
broken and democracy as a result is
 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.109
broken and democracy as a result is

heard which I don't think is good in the
 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.850
heard which I don't think is good in the
long term for sustainable development

long term for sustainable development
 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.850
long term for sustainable development

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860
and growth I think the volume of trade
 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.730
and growth I think the volume of trade
for countries that are able to get into

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740
for countries that are able to get into

Cambodia for example at one point

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590
Cambodia for example at one point
 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.350
Cambodia for example at one point
exported three billion dollars worth of

more than a million people benefited as

more than a million people benefited as
a result so this is far more meaningful

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119
a result so this is far more meaningful
 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.930
a result so this is far more meaningful
and far more sustainable I would argue

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940
and far more sustainable I would argue
 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.080
