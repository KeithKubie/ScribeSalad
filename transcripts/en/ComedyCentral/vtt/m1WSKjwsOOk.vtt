00:00:15.582 --> 00:00:17.183
but it's definitely him.

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:18.451
He looks really sad.

It's your favorite agent.

00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:48.514
You couldn't even give me
in the room for warhorse.

00:00:48.514 --> 00:00:50.183
There were like 10 horses
in that movie.

00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:51.851
I didn't need
to be the warhorse.

00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:53.786
Listen dummy I want to make sure
you're all set

00:00:53.786 --> 00:00:55.754
for your first day
with Diane tomorrow.

00:00:55.754 --> 00:00:57.824
Is she going to ask me
a bunch of personal questions.

00:00:57.824 --> 00:01:00.292
The woman we're paying
to goes write your memoir.

00:01:00.292 --> 00:01:02.528
Yeah probably.
OK all right

00:01:02.528 --> 00:01:04.096
there's no need to get catty.

00:01:04.096 --> 00:01:05.331
Are you going to say.

00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:06.833
Is not going to say catty.

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:08.768
Alright what were you
going to say?

00:01:08.768 --> 00:01:11.337
I was going to say catty
because you're a cat.

00:01:12.004 --> 00:01:13.706
Goodbye Bojack Laura
I know

00:01:13.706 --> 00:01:15.074
you're listening

00:01:15.074 --> 00:01:16.309
Laura do not respond to him.

00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:18.378
Goodbye Bojack.
She got it.

00:01:30.323 --> 00:01:31.858
Excuse me.

00:01:31.858 --> 00:01:33.393
I just wanted you to know

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:35.628
that you ruined
someone else's night tonight

00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:37.263
and I hope you have
enough decency

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:40.199
to at least feel
a little bit crappy about it.

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:42.802
Excuse me? I was actually
already in a bad mood

00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:44.504
but I thought maybe
for one night

00:01:44.504 --> 00:01:45.738
I could go out to a bar

00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:47.740
and try to forget about myself

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.408
but now because of you
and your friends

00:01:49.408 --> 00:01:51.510
I feel more self-conscious
than ever.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.247
If we were bothering you so much
why didn't you just leave?

00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:56.549
because I didn't think of that
and now I feel stupid.

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.251
Look I have aright to be hear-
No.

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:02.354
Maybe because you're skinny
and maybe because you're pretty

00:02:02.354 --> 00:02:04.323
you're used to getting away
with things

00:02:04.323 --> 00:02:05.724
but I want you to know

00:02:05.724 --> 00:02:08.194
that your actions
have enough effect on others.

00:02:08.194 --> 00:02:11.063
I hate you and you are
a horrible person.

00:02:11.063 --> 00:02:12.765
And you not understanding

00:02:12.765 --> 00:02:15.034
that you're a horrible person
doesn't make you

00:02:15.034 --> 00:02:19.172
less of a horrible person.
You think I'm pretty?
