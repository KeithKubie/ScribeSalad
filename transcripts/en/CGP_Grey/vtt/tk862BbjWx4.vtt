00:00:01.339 --> 00:00:04.640
The origin of copyright law takes us back
to the 1710 and Queen Anne, the Monarch who

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.759
had just overseen the Unification of England
and Scotland into then, brand-new Great Britain.

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:12.780
Also on her busy schedule was the Statute
of Anne: the very first copyright law. It

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.099
gave authors control over who could make copies
of their books or build on their work a limited

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:19.530
time.
Later a group of rebellious colonists, thought

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.110
the Statue of Anne was a good idea, and so
copy/pasted it into their own constitution

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.040
giving congress the power:
“To promote the Progress of Science and

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.980
useful Arts, by securing for limited Times
to Authors… the exclusive right to their

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.160
respective Writings”.
Basically, copyright is a contract between

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.130
authors and society: if you promise to make
more stuff, we promise not to copy it or build

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.420
on it for 28 years.
Here’s an example from the modern day: let’s

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.940
say you’re trying to be a director and you’re
looking for a project to get started.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.820
Harry Potter is a story you’d love to remake.
But since J. K. Rowling published ‘The Sorcerer’s

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.579
Stone’ in the United States in 1998 it still
has copyright protection, so you can’t use

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.610
it.
Instead you need find something from a long

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.770
time ago, like, for example:
Star Wars: A New Hope!

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.770
George Lucas released Star Wars: A New Hope
in 1977! That’s more than 28 years ago,

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.670
So great! Get filming!
Alas, no.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.869
While Star Wars should have lost copyright
protection in 2005 it’s actually copyrighted

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.549
until 2072!
That’s 95 years after publication, not 28!

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.249
So you can’t use it unless Lucas lets you.
Why does his copyright last for ages?

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:19.450
Well, as long as there has been copyright
there have been authors arguing that it’s

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.499
too short.
And perhaps, they’re right. How’s a poor

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:26.819
guy like George Lucas supposed turn a profit
in the mere 28 years between 1977 and 2005?

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:28.789
There was only the first theatrical release
of ‘A New Hope’,

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:32.229
And the theatrical re-released in 1978
and 1979

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.789
and 1981
and 1982

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:37.970
and then there was the 1982 VHS and Betamax
releases

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.840
the 1984 broadcast television release
the 1985 Laser disc release

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.009
the 1989 widescreen Laser disc release
the 1990 VHS re-release

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.919
the 1992 widescreen VHS release
the 1993 Laserdisc re-release

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:53.139
the 1995 VHS re-re-release
and the 1997 special edition theatrical release

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:56.429
Han shot first, you bastard.
and the 1997 VHS special edition release

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.889
and the 2004 DVD release
And now you, dear filmmaker, come along and

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:04.239
want make your own version of Star Wars:
a New Hope? For shame!

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:06.989
That like stealing food right out of George’s
Lucas’ mouth.

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:10.321
Four times Congress has agreed with authors
that the length of copyright is too short

00:02:10.321 --> 00:02:15.230
to turn a profit and so extended it:
First in 1831 from 28 years to 42 years, then

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.849
again in 1909 to 56 years, in 1976 to the
lifetime of the author plus 50 years, and

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.209
in1998 to the lifetime of the author plus
70 years.

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.430
That’s a great deal for authors who have
already made stuff, but does it really help

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.849
society get more movies and books?
It’s hard to imagine, for example, that

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.370
Edgar Rice Burroughs started writing ‘A
Princess of Mars’ and ‘Tarzan’ in 1911

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.939
because the copyright laws had just been extended
and would not have done so otherwise.

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:40.540
Or that J. K. Rowling, while living on benefits
in Scotland, was busy doing the math and wouldn’t

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.130
have written Harry Potter if the copyright
protection was just for her whole life and

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.650
not an additional seven decades thereafter.
Because, exactly who needs incentives after

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.950
they’re dead? Dead is the point at which
literally no incentives in the whole universe

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.831
can motivate you to write one more screenplay.
Because you’re dead.

00:02:54.831 --> 00:03:00.240
If you’re the kind of person who is only
motivated by plans that unravel after your

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.310
demise, you’re either amazingly awesome
or deranged.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.290
But so what? So what if every kindergartner’s
macaroni artwork is protected by copyright

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.920
for 175 years?
Why does it matter?

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.269
Because the main beneficiaries of copyright
after death are not the authors, or society

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.499
but companies. Companies like… Disney.
Remember all the good old Disney movies?

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:21.140
Yeah, all of them came from works no longer
under copyright protection at the time.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.890
The whole of the Disney Empire and all the
childhood magic that it produces only exist

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.150
because there was copyright free work for
Walt Disney – you know the guy who actually

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.129
started the whole company – to rework and
update.

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:34.530
But the corporate, Waltless Disney was the
big pusher of the 1998 life +70 years copyright

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.990
extension. It made sure that no one could
make more popular versions of their movies

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.760
in the same way they made a more popular version
of Alice in Wonderland.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.300
This near-infinite control subverts the whole
purpose of copyright which is to promote the

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.090
creation of more books and movies, not to
give companies the power to stop people making

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.659
new creative works based on the efforts on
their long-dead founders.

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:54.409
New directors and authors need the freedom
to take what came before to remake and remix

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:56.870
(romeo &amp; juliet, emma). And they should be
able to use creative material from their own

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.060
lifetime to do so, not just be limited to
the work of previous generations.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.939
At the turn of the century, George Lucas wrought
upon civilization a new word: anticipointment.

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:10.060
The tremendous let-down that was the lazy,
bland, and soulless new trilogy.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.299
George Lucas’s was completely within his
rights to make those movies into the sterile,

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:17.310
toy-marketing vehicles they were. He owned
Darth Vader and could tell the origin story

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.470
as he wished – and that’s the only version
you’ll ever get to see.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.440
But, imagine for a moment, if copyright still
worked as first intended.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.380
In 2011 the whole of the original Star Wars
trilogy – all of its artwork, its characters,

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.370
its music – would have left copyright protection
and been available to aspiring directors and

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.970
writers to build upon and make their own versions
of.

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.950
There would be a treasure trove of new Star
Wars stories for fans to enjoy.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.090
But as long as the current copyright laws
remain as they are, no living person will

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.780
ever get to tell a Darth Vader story, or a
Harry Potter Story, or a Hobbit Story or any

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.830
other story that matters to them, that the
author or, when after their death, their company,

00:04:48.830 --> 00:05:21.910
disagrees with.�
