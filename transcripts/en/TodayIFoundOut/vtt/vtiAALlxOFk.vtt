00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.880
During WWII, thousands of Japanese pilots
made the ultimate sacrifice for their country

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.860
by becoming, essentially, flying suicide bombers.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.500
But what was it that made these men so willing
to lay down their lives in such a way?

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.090
Were they really bright eyed volunteers eager
to sacrifice themselves for the greater good,

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.470
as the war time propaganda stated, or were
they forced into it?

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.410
Also, why exactly did the Japanese military
resort to such a tactic in the first place?

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.730
For starters, the Japanese military brass
were desperate.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.190
The enemy had them outgunned, out-manned,
and possessed certain critical technologies

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.820
that Japan didn’t have.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.760
To illustrate how dire things were, going
back to 1942, in a single day in June of that

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.760
year Japan lost more airmen than they had
managed to train in an entire year just before

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.760
the war.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.190
Adequately training new pilots fast enough
simply wasn’t feasible.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.799
This resulted in sending out relatively inexperienced
pilots in outdated aircraft.

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.509
There was a reason the Battle of the Philippine
Sea in June of 1944 became nicknamed “The

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.950
Great Marianas Turkey Shoot” by the Allies.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.270
Further, death before defeat was firmly ingrained
in the Japanese military culture at the time.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.929
In Emiko Ohnuki-Tierney’s work, Kamikaze
Diaries (accounts by the so-called “student

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:27.170
soldiers” of Japan from their writings during
the war- many of the prospective kamikaze

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.380
volunteers were these “boy-pilots”), it
stated one of the first things student soldiers

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.420
learned was

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.380
to use his toe to pull the trigger [of his
rifle] while pointing the gun precisely at

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.020
a certain point under his chin so that the
bullet would kill him instantly.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.850
He was supposed to use this technique if he
was trapped in a cave or in a trench surrounded

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:43.850
by the enemy.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.600
If he did not kill himself but tried to escape,
he might be shot from behind, because his

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.200
superiors and some comrades believed in the
state dictum that one must never be captured

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.470
by the enemy.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.139
This brings us to the Tokubetsu Kōgekitai
(literally, “Special Attack Unit”), members

00:01:58.139 --> 00:02:00.600
of which are commonly called “kamikazes”.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.579
Though the idea of sending pilots on one-way
suicide missions is largely attributed to

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:11.310
one, Capt. Motoharu Okamura, reports of Japanese
pilots intentionally crashing their planes

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.720
into the enemy, often when damaged too much
to return to base, weren’t unheard of prior

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.190
to the start of the suicide pilot initiative
in 1944.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.390
However, it was Capt. Motoharu Okamura who
is largely believed to have been the first

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.560
high-ranking Japanese officer to propose the
idea as a preplanned tactic.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.670
Famously stating:

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.410
In our present situation I firmly believe
that the only way to swing the war in our

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.960
favor is to resort to crash-dive attacks with
our planes.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.720
There is no other way.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.600
There will be more than enough volunteers
for this chance to save our country, and I

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.840
would like to command such an operation.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.420
Provide me with 300 planes and I will turn
the tide of war.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.030
That said, it was not Okamura, but then Vice-Admiral
of the Japanese Navy, Takijiro Onishi who

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.110
is credited with creating the first squadron
of kamikaze pilots.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.910
Onishi reportedly approached his superiors
to ask to create a suicide squad and was granted

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.630
permission on one condition, he was only allowed
to recruit volunteers.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.900
Determined to make his suicide squads a reality,
Onishi personally made the very first announcement

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.770
requesting volunteers for the “special attack
force” at Mabalacat Air Base.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.350
All 23 pilots asked to join ultimately volunteered.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.000
From here, reports of the day are that many
more pilots than there were planes eagerly

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.520
signed up (supposedly so many that they outnumbered
the available planes 3 to 1).

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.000
As Captain Motoharu Okamura stated, “There
were so many volunteers for suicide missions

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.620
that he referred to them as a swarm of bees…

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.020
Bees die after they have stung.”

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:43.850
(In truth, bees do not usually die after they
sting things.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.940
This generally only happens when they sting
humans, as their stingers get stuck in our

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:48.940
fleshy skin.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.860
This is not the case when they sting many
other animals.)

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.870
However, the official story of droves of zealous
volunteers clamoring to sign up has been questioned

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.520
by many historians, particularly with firsthand
accounts from actual pilots popping up since,

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.270
painting a decidedly less patriotic or eager
tone.

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.310
Imperial Japanese Navy Gekitsui-O (flying
ace), Saburo Sakai, who had at least 28 victories

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.700
ranking him fourth for the war for Japan,
including shooting down or severely damaging

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.320
over 60 Allied planes, stated in an interview,
“Even now, many faces of my students come

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.850
up when I close my eyes.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.190
So many students are gone.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.840
Why did headquarters continue such silly attacks
for ten months!

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.430
Fools! … all those men lied that all men
volunteered for kamikaze units.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.430
They lied!”

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.560
Further, many of the “boy-soldiers” who
ended up becoming kamikaze pilots were brutally

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.740
treated during their training, to the point
that, based on firsthand accounts from the

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.990
trainees, many lost any sense of patriotism.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.420
For instance, Irokawa Daikichi stated he was
“struck on the face so hard and frequently

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.780
that [his] face was no longer recognizable…

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.740
I was hit so hard that I could no longer see
and fell on the floor.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.440
The minute I got up, I was hit again by a
club…”

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.380
Officially, the purpose for this extremely
brutal “training” was to instill in the

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.470
soldiers a “fighting spirit”.

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.620
Hayashi Ichizo went on to say,

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.100
It is easy to talk about death in the abstract,
as the ancient philosophers discussed.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.510
But it is real death I fear, and I don’t
know if I can overcome the fear.

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.430
Even for a short life, there are many memories.

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.910
For someone who had a good life, it is very
difficult to part with it.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.740
But I reached a point of no return.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.080
I must plunge into an enemy vessel.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.370
To be honest, I cannot say that the wish to
die for the emperor is genuine, coming from

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.370
my heart.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.090
However, it is decided for me that I die for
the emperor.

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.050
These were sentiments echoed by Lieutenant
Yukio Seki, who commanded the first squadron

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.490
of 23: “Japan’s future is bleak if it
is forced to kill one of its best pilots…

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.500
I am not going on this mission for the Emperor
or for the Empire…

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.000
I am going because I was ordered to.”

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.419
While there certainly were those who were
willing to volunteer to die for emperor and

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:54.669
country, and many more willing to die in this
way simply because they felt, somewhat correctly,

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:58.620
that they were the last line of defense to
protect their families and friends at home,

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.020
in truth many seem to have simply been pressured
into it.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:07.140
So what tactics were specifically used to
convince the volunteers?

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:11.880
As noted in Mako Sasaki’s paper, Who Became
Kamikaze Pilots, and How Did They Feel Towards

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.650
Their Suicide Mission, published in The Concord
Review, some men were recruited to the program

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.780
by way of a simple questionnaire.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:24.430
The questionnaire comprised of a single multi-choice
question that asked: “Do you desire earnestly/wish/do

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.280
not wish to be involved in kamikaze attacks?”

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.720
All the men had to do was circle the statement
they most agreed with.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.760
The kicker being that although the men were
free to say they didn’t want to take part,

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.820
they still had to sign their name to it.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.430
As Sasaki points out, the pressure on young
men to do something for their country during

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:45.949
that time was significant, and the threat
of retaliation if you said no was very real,

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:49.600
as was the fear that there would potentially
be retaliation against not only the soldier,

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.350
but his family back home.

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:56.520
According to the aforementioned Emiko Ohnuki-Tierney,
in Kamikaze Diaries, other methods of encouraging

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.530
men to volunteer included putting them in
a room filled with their peers.

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:04.479
After a lengthy speech on patriotism, it was
asked that anyone who didn’t wish to be

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:06.780
a kamikaze step forward.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:11.050
As you can imagine, volunteering by default
in this way was extremely effective.

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:15.910
Beyond any loyalty to country and emperor,
few would want to appear so cowardly, or endure

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:19.930
the shame of not being willing to die when
their fellow soldiers were giving their own

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:21.110
lives to protect their homeland, both those
present when volunteers were being asked for

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:22.110
and ultimately those who’d already fulfilled
their suicide missions.

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:23.110
This latter point was frequently written about
in the letters and journals from many of the

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:24.110
volunteers as to why they ultimately chose
to do so.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.270
If you’re wondering what happened to the
few men that said no, according to Emiko,

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:30.040
If a soldier had managed to be courageous
enough not to volunteer, he would have been

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.240
consigned to a living hell.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:37.720
Any soldier who refused would become persona
non grata or be sent to the southern battlefield,

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.410
where death was guaranteed.

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:43.310
Some soldiers actually managed to say no,
but their refusal was disregarded.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:47.330
Kuroda Kenjirō decided not to volunteer,
only to be taken by surprise when he found

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:52.020
his name on the list of volunteers for the
Mitate Navy tokkōtai corps; his superior

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:56.130
had reported proudly that all the members
of his corps had volunteered.

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:58.370
Not all kamikaze pilots died though.

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:02.350
If a pilot’s plane developed a problem en
route or if a suitable target didn’t present

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:06.389
itself, there was nothing stopping him from
returning to base to try again later.

00:08:06.389 --> 00:08:10.740
In fact, the manual given to kamikaze pilots
stated: “In the event of poor weather conditions

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:15.610
when you cannot locate the target, or under
other adverse circumstances, you may decide

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:16.770
to return to base.

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:18.180
Don’t be discouraged.

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:20.020
Do not waste your life lightly.”

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:25.300
All that said, in an interview with an ex-kamikaze
pilot named Tadamasa Itatsu, he notes that

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:29.979
some young men were willing to lay down their
lives simply because they genuinely “believed

00:08:29.979 --> 00:08:33.550
their actions could save their country from
disaster“.

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:38.349
As Ichizo Hayashi stated in a letter he wrote
in April of 1945, a few days before his death,

00:08:38.349 --> 00:08:42.509
“I am pleased to have the honour of having
been chosen as a member of a Special Attack

00:08:42.509 --> 00:08:47.149
Force that is on its way into battle, but
I cannot help crying when I think of you,

00:08:47.149 --> 00:08:48.149
Mum.

00:08:48.149 --> 00:08:51.660
When I reflect on the hopes you had for my
future … I feel so sad that I am going to

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.350
die without doing anything to bring you joy.”

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:59.470
This all might leave you wondering how effective
the kamikaze program was for the Japanese.

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:03.850
According to the U.S. Air Force, nearly three
thousand kamikaze attacks took place, managing

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:11.630
to damage 368 ships, sinking 34 of them, while
killing 4,900 navy soldiers and wounding another

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:17.220
4,800, but with only about 14% of attacking
kamikaze pilots managing to hit a ship.

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:21.700
So, in that sense, plane for plane, it was
tragically successful considering the Americans

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:26.880
had radar, superior numbers and planes, and
the kamikaze pilots were often woefully inexperienced.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:31.400
But on the other hand, perhaps Lieutenant
Commander Iwatani said it best in a March

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.450
of 1945 edition of Taiyo magazine,

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:39.250
I cannot predict the outcome of the air battles,
but you will be making a mistake if you should

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:42.399
regard Special Attack operations as normal
methods.

00:09:42.399 --> 00:09:46.990
The right way is to attack the enemy with
skill and return to the base with good results.

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:50.070
A plane should be utilized over and over again.

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:51.760
That’s the way to fight a war.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.620
The current thinking is skewed.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.770
Otherwise, you cannot expect to improve air
power.

00:09:56.770 --> 00:10:00.790
There will be no progress if flyers continue
to die.

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:06.370
The Japanese also had a group of one manned
torpedo like submarines called kaitens that

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:11.040
were also used for the same purpose as the
kamikaze pilots- essentially, humans were

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.230
the guidance system.

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:16.180
These kaitens were just modified torpedoes
that allowed the person inside to control

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:17.180
them.

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:20.480
They also featured a self destruct mechanism
if the person failed in their mission.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:24.640
This was necessary as there was no way for
the person inside to get out of the torpedo

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:25.730
once sealed in.

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:30.060
Early models did include a mechanism to escape
once the torpedo was aimed correctly, but

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:34.589
not a single soldier seems to have ever used
this feature, so it was quickly abandoned.

00:10:34.589 --> 00:10:39.780
Each person who died as a kaiten pilot would
earn their family ¥10000 (about $120 today).

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:44.950
Kaitens were ultimately not very successful
primary because they could not be deployed

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:48.180
very deeply and were stored on the outside
of the submarines.

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:51.060
This isn’t so much a problem for the kaitens
as it was for the submarines carrying them

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:53.160
who would have to stay very near the surface.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:57.420
This resulted in an average of about eight
submarines carrying kaitens being destroyed

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.720
for every two ships destroyed by the kaitens.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:03.940
Each kaiten was about 50 feet long; could
reach a maximum speed of about 30 miles per

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:19.510
hour; and contained a warhead 

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:36.769
at 
the nose.
