YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.420
AND HERE HE COMES OUT THE ROOM,
WHEN I LOOK AT HIM--

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:09.809
AND I'M NOT
BULLSHITTING YOU, MAN,

LIKE AN ORANGE--
HIS AURA OR WHATEVER,

00:00:13.646 --> 00:00:14.614
I SEEN IT.

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:15.615
IT WAS ORANGE.

00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:16.849
♪ GIVE IT TO ME, BABY ♪

00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:20.253
♪ GIVE IT TO ME, BABY ♪

00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:21.687
HE STARTED KICKING IT.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.322
AND HE WAS
MAD NIGGERISH, MAN,

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:24.690
WHICH WAS, YOU KNOW,
RIGHT UP MY ALLEY.

00:00:24.723 --> 00:00:26.592
I'M ONE OF THE BADDEST
MOTHERFUCKERS OF ALL TIME.

00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:28.127
I'M ONE OF
THE BEST SINGERS

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.163
AND ONE OF THE BEST-LOOKIN'
MOTHERFUCKERS YOU'VE EVER SEEN.

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:31.330
HOLD MY DRINK, BITCH.

00:00:31.363 --> 00:00:32.632
HE'D WALK UP TO ANY CHICK

00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:34.567
AND LICK THE WHOLE SIDE
OF THEIR FACE, MAN.

00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:40.173
I'M RICK JAMES, BITCH.

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:41.574
ENJOY YOURSELF.

00:00:41.607 --> 00:00:42.942
[chuckling]

00:00:42.975 --> 00:00:45.111
WE GOT CLOSER,
STARTED HANGING OUT.

00:00:45.144 --> 00:00:48.514
MY BROTHER DIDN'T DO
ANY OF THIS SHIT.

00:00:48.547 --> 00:00:50.650
SO AT NIGHT,
WHEN EDDIE WOULD BREAK OUT,

00:00:50.683 --> 00:00:53.419
WE WOULD ALL BE
GETTING CRAZY AND WILD.

00:00:53.452 --> 00:00:55.354
AND IF I WAS HANGING
WITH RICK,

00:00:55.387 --> 00:00:56.622
HE HAD THIS THING WITH ME

00:00:56.655 --> 00:00:58.991
WHERE HE USED TO ALWAYS,
LIKE, FUCK WITH ME, MAN.

00:00:59.024 --> 00:01:01.527
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT STARTED IT.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.596
CHARLIE, HE WAS HANGING OUT
WITH THE BIG DOGS, YOU KNOW?

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.798
CHARLIE, HE DIDN'T KNOW
HE WAS DOING CRAZY THINGS

00:01:05.831 --> 00:01:07.200
AND I HAD
TO STRAIGHTEN HIM OUT.

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:09.135
SOMETIMES I HAD TO GO
UPSIDE HIS HEAD.

00:01:09.168 --> 00:01:12.672
THINGS ESCALATED
TO THE POINT WHERE, YOU KNOW,

00:01:12.705 --> 00:01:14.607
MY MAN GOT TOO FAMILIAR

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.309
AND I ENDED UP HAVING
TO WHIP HIS ASS, MAN,

00:01:16.342 --> 00:01:17.543
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE,

00:01:17.576 --> 00:01:20.246
YOU KNOW, HE WOULD
STEP ACROSS THE LINE.

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:23.649
HABITUALLY.
HE'S A HABITUAL LINE-STEPPER.

00:01:23.682 --> 00:01:24.917
THE FIRST TIME, YOU KNOW,

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.521
I HAD TO END UP
WHIPPING HIS ASS, UH...

00:01:28.554 --> 00:01:30.790
WE WENT TO STUDIO 54.

00:01:30.823 --> 00:01:34.093
WE WALKIN' UP

00:01:34.126 --> 00:01:35.995
I'M LOOKING AROUND
TO SEE WHO'S THERE

00:01:36.028 --> 00:01:37.663
AND LOOKIN' AT THE GIRLS
AND EVERYTHING.

00:01:37.696 --> 00:01:39.198
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN
I HEARD SOMEONE GO...

00:01:39.231 --> 00:01:43.069

THAT WAS...
♪ COLD-BLOODED ♪

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:49.876
[laughs]

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:51.410
HE HAD THIS RING ON

00:01:51.443 --> 00:01:53.913
TO COMMEMORATE THIS SONG
HE HAD PUT OUT CALLED UNITY.

00:01:53.946 --> 00:01:58.084
AND THIS WAS IMPRINTED
IN THAT BLACK HEAD OF HIS

00:01:58.117 --> 00:02:00.219
FOR AT LEAST A WEEK.

00:02:00.252 --> 00:02:02.788
♪ UNITY ♪

00:02:02.821 --> 00:02:04.824
EDDIE AND EVERYBODY ELSE

00:02:04.857 --> 00:02:06.559
THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS
THE FUNNIEST SHIT.

00:02:06.592 --> 00:02:08.728
AND SO THAT THREW ME IN
A WEIRD SPACE,

00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:10.930
'CAUSE I'M LIKE,
YEAH, THIS IS RICK JAMES.

00:02:10.963 --> 00:02:12.532
HE'S A STAR.

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:15.434
I'M RICK JAMES, BITCH.
[laughs]

00:02:15.467 --> 00:02:18.538
THIS IS A CELEBRATION, BITCH.
[laughs]

00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:19.939
MAYBE I'M OVERREACTING.

00:02:19.972 --> 00:02:21.340
I ACTUALLY WENT THERE, LIKE,

00:02:21.373 --> 00:02:22.608
"MAYBE I SHOULDN'T DO NOTHING,"

00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:24.410
BUT MY GHETTO SIDE WAS GOIN',

00:02:24.443 --> 00:02:27.113
"YO, STOMP THIS MOTHERFUCKER
OUT RIGHT HERE.

00:02:27.146 --> 00:02:28.814
WHAT THE FUCK
IS WRONG WITH HIM?"

00:02:28.847 --> 00:02:30.016
I DRUNK SOME WINE

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:31.184
AND I'M JUST GETTING
STARTED, BITCHES.

00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:32.485
[laughing]

00:02:32.518 --> 00:02:34.053
HE TOTALLY
JUST WROTE ME OFF.

00:02:34.086 --> 00:02:35.555
LIKE, I'M THAT NIGGA
TO STEAL ON,

00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:36.556
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYIN'?

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:38.224
WHAT, HE'S GONNA SLAP ME BACK?

00:02:38.257 --> 00:02:40.760
I'M RICK JAMES.
HE'S CHARLIE MURPHY.

00:02:40.793 --> 00:02:43.996
I WAITED, 'CAUSE I KNEW
WHAT HOTEL HE WAS STAYIN' IN.

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:45.264
EDDIE AND THEM WENT HOME

00:02:45.297 --> 00:02:46.632
AND I SAID,
"YO, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK."

00:02:46.665 --> 00:02:49.168
I SHOT OVER TO THE HOTEL,
WENT UP TO HIS ROOM,

00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:50.236
KNOCKED ON THE DOOR.

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.572
SO THEN HE COMES IN THERE.

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:55.474
AND I SAID, "LOOK, BITCH,
I'M RICK JAMES."

00:02:55.507 --> 00:02:59.245
SMACKED HIM.
[chuckling]

00:02:59.278 --> 00:03:03.149
OH, CHARLIE MURPHY!

00:03:03.182 --> 00:03:05.985
HE HAD HIS HEAD COCKED
TO THROW ANOTHER RIGHT HAND.

00:03:06.018 --> 00:03:08.588
WHEN HE WAS COMING FOR IT,
I JUST CAME--BLAOW!

00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:10.156
I CAUGHT HIM
WITH THE FRONT.

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:11.390
HE'LL TELL IT
LIKE HE GAVE ME

00:03:11.423 --> 00:03:14.060
SOME KIND OF BRUCE LEE
CROSSKICK OR SOMETHIN'.

00:03:14.093 --> 00:03:16.329
I KICKED THE SHIT
OUT OF HIM, MAN.

00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:17.630
[screams]

00:03:19.798 --> 00:03:22.035
[screams in slow motion]

00:03:24.303 --> 00:03:26.305
THE WIND IS
KNOCKED OUT OF HIM.

00:03:26.338 --> 00:03:28.841
AND THEN HE SCREAMS OUT...

00:03:28.874 --> 00:03:30.776
SECURITY!

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:33.112
THE ONE IN THE FRONT,
HE HAD CROOKED EYES AND SHIT.

00:03:33.145 --> 00:03:34.780
HIS ONE EYE WAS LOOKIN' AT ME.

00:03:34.813 --> 00:03:36.983
THE OTHER ONE
WAS LOOKING AT RICK.

00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:39.852
RICK HAD EDGED OVER
BY THE WINDOW.

00:03:39.885 --> 00:03:43.155
NOW, DARKNESS,
THE TABLES ARE TURNED.

00:03:43.188 --> 00:03:44.724
DO WITH HIM WHATEVER YOU LIKE.

00:03:44.757 --> 00:03:46.592

00:03:50.462 --> 00:03:52.798
YOU KNOW YOU WAS WRONG
FOR WHAT YOU DID TO ME EARLIER.

00:03:52.831 --> 00:03:54.968
LOOK WHAT YOU DID
TO MY FACE.

00:03:57.236 --> 00:03:59.305
I'M SORRY, CHARLIE MURPHY.
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

00:03:59.338 --> 00:04:01.073
I WAS HAVING TOO MUCH FUN.

00:04:01.106 --> 00:04:03.943
I'LL OFFER YOU A TRUCE.

00:04:03.976 --> 00:04:05.645
THE STICKIEST OF THE ICKY.

00:04:05.678 --> 00:04:07.446
YOU WANT TO SMOKE

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:10.716
YO, MAN, MY FOREHEAD

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:12.251
NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT,

00:04:12.284 --> 00:04:15.388
I THINK I'M BLEEDING
INSIDE MY CHEST.

00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:17.123
BUT I GOT THE MEDICINE.

00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:19.358

THAT WAS HOW
THAT PARTICULAR INCIDENT ENDED,

00:04:26.365 --> 00:04:28.701
BUT IT WASN'T THE LAST TIME
I HAD TO WHIP HIS ASS...

WHIP HIS ASS...

00:04:30.736 --> 00:04:32.271
DON'T YOU THINK
CHARLIE'S A LITTLE OLD

00:04:32.304 --> 00:04:33.939
TO BE TAKING KARATE?

00:04:33.972 --> 00:04:36.208
HE PROBABLY TAKIN' IT

00:04:38.177 --> 00:04:39.312
I TOLD YOU, CHARLIE HAD

00:04:39.345 --> 00:04:40.813
DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR
IN HIS HEAD.

00:04:40.846 --> 00:04:43.112
I'M TELLING YOU
WHAT WAS HAPPENING.
