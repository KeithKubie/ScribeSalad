1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,640
Okay. So, um,

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,700
just want to go back very briefly
to the title of as I lay dying.

3
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:11,910
As you guys know, the
title is taken from, uh,

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:16,290
the other save book 11 and um, is, um,

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:21,780
Agamemnon is, um, has gone
to the underworld and his,

6
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,780
uh, dcs has gone to the underwear
and he's talking to Agamemnon power,

7
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:31,440
who's telling him about the circumstances
of his death and his murder by his

8
00:00:31,441 --> 00:00:34,590
wife are collecting the astro.
So as I lay dying,

9
00:00:34,591 --> 00:00:36,450
the woman with the dogs,

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,220
I were not close my eyes as
I descended into hades. Um,

11
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,260
so this is the original,
um,

12
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:48,000
inspiring moment in many ways of four,
four,

13
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:52,620
four Faulkner.
And today I like to talk a little more,

14
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:57,390
um, about the whole of modernism
and the epic tradition.

15
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,650
Um,
and obviously we see with red enough of,

16
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,220
as I lay dying to know that this
is in many ways an epic journey.

17
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:09,840
It is a journey, um, very
heroic or mock heroic journey,

18
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,630
uh, to Barry. Addie, you, so is,

19
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:17,690
it has all the trappings of the APIC
is an epic journey on a small scale.

20
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,970
Um, and it's also, uh,

21
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,160
taking advantage of to epic conventions.
Um,

22
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,280
we've seen just now that we hear the
voice of the debt and that's a very

23
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:36,270
important adding a convention
both in homer and in downtown.

24
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,760
And as we'll see,
um,

25
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,180
it is also a very important
convention in as I lay dying as well.

26
00:01:42,181 --> 00:01:45,760
The farmer is making very liberal use of,
um,

27
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,920
the other interesting epic conversion
that I think has been involved in as I lay

28
00:01:51,661 --> 00:01:56,490
dying is the uncertain boundaries
between the human and the nonhuman.

29
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,570
And we have already actually
seeing a little bit of that.

30
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:04,800
So just wanted to refresh your memory
with something that we discussed last time

31
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,980
in terms of the two kinds
of speech right now.

32
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:11,100
Last week we talked about the social
dialogue on the one hand and then on the

33
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:13,860
other hand, the worst with secrets. Um,

34
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:19,040
and this is one instance of worst
with secrets coming from vitamin.

35
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:20,190
Um,

36
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:25,190
so this is vitamin talking about something
in the bond after he has been beaten

37
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:30,840
people these horses and broken the
state. Um, it is as though the dark,

38
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,080
we're resolving him out of his integrity
into an unrelated a scattering of

39
00:02:37,141 --> 00:02:38,040
components,

40
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,280
snuffed things and stamping smells of
cooling flash and ammonia hair and the

41
00:02:44,911 --> 00:02:48,150
illusion of a coordinator,
the whole large,

42
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:53,151
high and strong bones within which
drange and siblings and Somalia and is

43
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:59,620
different from my yes.
Um,

44
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,680
most likely vitamin is talking
about the horse by this weekend.

45
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,900
See as, especially as we get
closer to the end of that has, um,

46
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:14,930
this being that is drenched and secret
and familiar and is different from mine

47
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:20,920
is vitamins things to be talking
really more about his brother Joel,

48
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:23,290
then about Jules horse.
Um,

49
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:27,250
and it's really hard to
say when the human and,

50
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:32,080
and when the animal begins in that
particular passage. So this is,

51
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:32,410
um,

52
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:37,410
something that we see both in the kind
of a small moment like this and as I lay

53
00:03:38,561 --> 00:03:38,860
down,

54
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:43,850
but also in the very dramatized Merwin
when volume and says my mother's a fish,

55
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,620
uh,

56
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:49,270
where obviously a strong analogy is
being established between human and

57
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:53,200
nonhuman. We'll come back to
that statement, um, on Thursday.

58
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:57,010
But today I like to,
um, just to go back, um,

59
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:02,310
a little bit and give you a sense of
this very long epic tradition behind as I

60
00:04:02,651 --> 00:04:07,170
lay dying by going back to
hormone and Dante and, um,

61
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,110
in [inaudible] I want to talk about
two instances. Um, the side clubs,

62
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:16,140
obviously we don't know
if he's fully human.

63
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,680
Um,
and,

64
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:22,510
and even more famous episode is
Searcy attorney humans into animals.

65
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:27,430
And then Dante following through
with that convention in Inferno, uh,

66
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,270
when humans are turned into animals,
there's punishment. So first of all,

67
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:35,210
homer in book, nine of the artist say, uh,

68
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:39,860
Odysseus and his men are trapped
inside cage by the side clubs. Um,

69
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,290
and the way that they tried to
escape is by blinding aside clubs.

70
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,263
Polycythemia is,

71
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,320
and so this is a moment that is reproduced
by just about all the painters who,

72
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:50,800
uh,

73
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,800
paying that seen that episode in the
Odyssey is the blinding of the eye.

74
00:04:56,081 --> 00:05:00,280
And we know that cycle of the lands
one eyes. So it's relatively easy.

75
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,710
It's the only have to do at once.
Um,

76
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:07,060
so here's is ucs blinding
eye of the cyclops.

77
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,410
And we can see that, um, the
cyclops themes bigger, you know,

78
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:16,070
the main difference seems to be in size
and also the amount of hair on him. Uh,

79
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,300
but otherwise he seems,
he looks he's a human form.

80
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,930
But we also know that it's different if
only because there's one either in the

81
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:27,670
center of his forehead. Um,
so he is not quite human,

82
00:05:27,671 --> 00:05:32,671
but his close enough and
that is a condition that is
especially fascinating to

83
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:39,310
epic authors. Um, just give you a
couple more images of the cyclops.

84
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:44,020
Basically. You know, it's the same,
same kind of idea. He's much larger,

85
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,980
um, has a lot more hair but otherwise
has a recognizable human form. Um,

86
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,640
three far the man trying to um,

87
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:56,620
use that spike to blind side clubs.
And here is one more image.

88
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:01,120
Um, so it's pretty much is that there
seems to be kind of consensus, um,

89
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,910
in thinking about is high clubs
that he really basically is like us.

90
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,200
But what is also interesting is
that after his eye has been blinded,

91
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:10,950
um,
decide,

92
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:16,050
labs wants to make sure that when his
ship leave the cage that they wouldn't be

93
00:06:16,821 --> 00:06:19,820
humans. Hiding, uh, going along with them.

94
00:06:19,821 --> 00:06:23,570
So it's counting all his sheep as
they go out, as they leave the cage,

95
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,680
even though he his cave, even
though he can really see them. Um,

96
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,800
and he surprised that his favorite shoe
is the last to go and he's the last to

97
00:06:33,621 --> 00:06:35,360
go because this is clinging to him.

98
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:39,590
But this is where science club says
to his sheep, sweet cousin Ram,

99
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,690
why lab behind arrests in the night cave?
You never lingo so,

100
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:49,190
but Grey's before they're more
and go far to crops, wheat,

101
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:54,191
grass and take your stays
there were leading along the
streams until an evening.

102
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:59,510
You come to be the first one in the fall.
Why now so far behind?

103
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:03,660
Can you be grieving over your masters?
I,

104
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,850
so this is, um, not only is, um,

105
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,600
a sense of is there a sense of kinship,
um,

106
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,240
between the side gloves and his shoes,

107
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,720
but this is one of the earliest moments
of a cross species identification that

108
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:27,730
decide clubs obviously is
mourning the loss of his eye. Um,

109
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:32,890
and his imagining has proved jetting
that grief onto his shit and recreating

110
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,810
kinship on a different level.
Not just on the physical level,

111
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,250
there's a connection between humans and
animals, but also on a psychic level,

112
00:07:43,251 --> 00:07:46,460
on an emotional level,
there is that kind of kinship.

113
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,140
So the other thing I would say,

114
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:53,150
it's one of the earliest moments of
really interesting kind of cross species

115
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:57,470
imagination at least in
this one moment. Um, so, um,

116
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,240
the more better known moment,

117
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,720
and actually I would argue
with less siloed than theirs
is the transformation of

118
00:08:02,721 --> 00:08:06,040
humans, um, by, uh, Cersei and here's at,

119
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:09,910
this is going after her because she was
transformed one of his men into, uh,

120
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,330
animal.
Um,

121
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,140
so we see many instances of this
arm and this is an amazing, um,

122
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,870
image. Uh, I mean this kind of vessel, um,

123
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,420
with all the animals, uh,
and [inaudible] house.

124
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:27,480
And I think that we recognize
that actually there's a
strong Egyptian influenced,

125
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,100
um,

126
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,510
this image is loafer Egyptian and there
is in fact a constant traffic between,

127
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:35,350
uh, Greece, ancient
Greece and Egypt. So, um,

128
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,780
it's partly that the impetus
for thinking about humans,

129
00:08:38,781 --> 00:08:42,820
they're not humans is coming from, it's
coming from [inaudible] as well. Um,

130
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,910
and he has just to complete our discussion
of the Arabic tradition that Dante is

131
00:08:46,911 --> 00:08:47,780
doing the same thing.

132
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,970
And I just wanted to alert you that
the snake is very important. Um,

133
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:57,140
the connection between the human
and nonhuman in the inferno, um,

134
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:01,900
is that Dante is basically
punitive philosophy, um,

135
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,980
is that humans get punished by being
changed into something that resembles the

136
00:09:08,311 --> 00:09:09,144
crime.

137
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:14,330
So thieves because there's Nikki in
the snake their way into other people's

138
00:09:14,401 --> 00:09:19,170
dwellings and of text
book belongs to them. Um,

139
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:23,040
that fears are turning
into snakes in the info.

140
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,010
So lots of snakes in there.
Further off,

141
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:30,990
and one more dramatic representation.
All these are by William Blake. Um,

142
00:09:30,991 --> 00:09:35,991
so we kind of have a really interesting
congestion of a 19th century author

143
00:09:36,211 --> 00:09:40,290
going back to Dante and reproducing
this very emblematic moments.

144
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,300
Um,
so there,

145
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,320
so we have on record in 19th century
author William Blake being inspired by the

146
00:09:47,641 --> 00:09:48,660
epic tradition.

147
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:54,080
And I think the foreigner is a 20th
century instance of a similar kind of

148
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:59,010
inspiration, but as we're Faulkner, um,

149
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,660
he as a,

150
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:04,770
another layer of complexity
to the epic tradition.

151
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:09,150
And I would say that this is actually
one of the most important innovations.

152
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,460
And as I lay dying,
um,

153
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:17,160
in many ways more interesting than the
epic journey itself is that humans are

154
00:10:17,161 --> 00:10:21,000
rarely identified with
just one kind of animal.

155
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:26,570
More often they are poor between
two ends of the spectrum.

156
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:32,280
Um, they sometimes identify with one and
sometimes identified with the other and

157
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,230
sometimes it's a mixture of the two.

158
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:39,680
So the two parents rooms that I would
like to talk about in that context,

159
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,720
um, uh, first is first of all a how, um,

160
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:47,280
and then Jude,
how was a minor character,

161
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:52,640
but in many ways he's a really
good example to concentrate on,

162
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:58,350
um, to try to get a sense of the
basic narrative strategies, um,

163
00:10:58,410 --> 00:10:59,243
in Faulkner.

164
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:04,460
So I would just like to stop here for
a moment and talk about possible paver

165
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,570
topics.
Um,

166
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:11,010
when you think of the upcoming long paper,
um,

167
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:16,010
is to focus on minor characters.
It is counted to they,

168
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:19,120
um, to use minor characters, um,

169
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,550
as the main subject of your papers.
But actually, um, I promise you,

170
00:11:23,551 --> 00:11:28,320
especially in the case of fogging or you
can get wonderful papers by focusing on

171
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:33,360
focusing on someone liked how, uh,
or even someone might Cora, uh,

172
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,420
very, uh, obvious entry point,

173
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,390
but because they are an
obvious Andrea points,

174
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:42,900
you can actually end up writing really
interesting and surprising and compelling

175
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,190
papers.
Um,

176
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:48,780
so I'll try to give you a demonstration
today of what could be done by focusing

177
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,620
on a minor character lighthouse and
then obviously moving on to central

178
00:11:53,621 --> 00:11:54,670
character Joe.

179
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,360
So I like to argue that toe is basically
identified with two opposing kinds of

180
00:12:02,951 --> 00:12:07,660
animal. One is the mew,
um, the indispensable, um,

181
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:12,250
animal amount, poor waste, the
meal rather than the horse. Um,

182
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,490
and then, um, Aphasia.

183
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:18,220
They'll also mixed a routine
appearance in Falkland Deposit.

184
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,990
So first of all, the
new and how as new, like

185
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,860
when I look back and my new,

186
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:32,400
it was like he was one of
these spy glasses and I
couldn't look at him standing

187
00:12:33,101 --> 00:12:35,920
there and see it all abroad land.

188
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:41,080
Am I house sweated out of it?
Like it was. The more the sweat,

189
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:44,530
the broaden the land,
the more the sweat,

190
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:50,070
the title of the House because it would
take a tight house for Cora to hold Cora

191
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,070
like a job.
Nope.

192
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,910
In the spring you've got to have a
tight jar or you need a power spring.

193
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:00,430
So if you have a big spring,
why,

194
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:03,170
then you have the incentive to have tight,

195
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:07,720
well make jars because it
is your milk sour or not.

196
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:13,140
Because you would rather have milk that
was sour than to have milk that won't

197
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:18,610
because you are a man.
I've no idea what he's talking about.

198
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,880
Um, this, this is really, you know,

199
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:26,660
I think maybe it's just the sound of
it that thought that was, is to, um,

200
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:31,630
get the flavor of thoughts that might
have been causing through tells head.

201
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,790
It's just a wonderful moment
and talking about manhood, um,

202
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,640
amount more ways.
Um,

203
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:42,690
people who don't have a lot to
prove the man who went right middle,

204
00:13:43,711 --> 00:13:48,290
fast, no cars, no iPhone was nothing. Um,

205
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,930
so very,
uh,

206
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:54,070
poor equipment with which
to prove your manhood.

207
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:57,060
And the only thing that,
um,

208
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:01,810
tell can use, um, is just his view.

209
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:06,870
And so he's looking at his meal and
by looking at his knee and somehow his

210
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:11,620
thoughts neander to the most important
person in his life, his wife,

211
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,040
Laura. Um, and is,

212
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,840
that is his claim to core out.

213
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:22,560
So I won't be able to tell you,
you know,

214
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:26,530
the logic behind this
little bit of reasoning,

215
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,390
which is really more emotional reasoning.
There was a reroute reasoning,

216
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:36,100
but it seems that how is
saying that his claim to Cora,

217
00:14:36,101 --> 00:14:40,270
the way that he can keep her,
keep her in a tight house, um,

218
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,140
both in his,

219
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:46,140
the physical house but also in a tight
place in his heart and in her art,

220
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:51,470
um, is by being a very
good neighbor, by sweating,

221
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,150
um, and cultivating the land, um,

222
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:59,480
and making sure that the more the sweat,

223
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,270
the tighter the house,
right.

224
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:07,270
So this is the logic that this
is the nature of manhood amount.

225
00:15:08,961 --> 00:15:13,961
Four ways is that it is by this web of
your brow that you can win the woman's

226
00:15:15,531 --> 00:15:20,090
call. You know, it's nothing
fancy, nothing complicated,

227
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,220
various simple logic.
But of course,

228
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:26,750
it doesn't come out in a
simple way and Faulkner, um,

229
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:31,900
and that really is kind
of the defining nature of,

230
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:37,210
uh, the existence of very
poor, rural people, um,

231
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:41,540
is that basically you only have
one thing, um, to prove yourself.

232
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,960
And we can see that why on
this one thing as a such an,

233
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:50,010
an adequate specimen of masculinity
is just not a very good workman.

234
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:54,770
Um, so how is by contrast,
someone who was fully adequate,

235
00:15:54,771 --> 00:15:55,850
fully competent,

236
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:01,010
fully impressive specimen of manhood
in that particular environment.

237
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:04,970
Um, and he's very proud. You know,
this is a very joyful moment.

238
00:16:04,971 --> 00:16:07,970
This is one of the great
scenes about marriage.

239
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:13,070
And on Thursday we'll talk about
contrasting scene of a very bad marriage,

240
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:16,100
contrasting with his head,
very happy seeing of, of, of,

241
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,340
of a married couple in Faulkner.
Um,

242
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:24,550
but as we're father
millstone stay happy forever.

243
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:30,350
Uh, oh, humans that are like
meals don't stay happy forever.

244
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:35,390
So we're turning to a
different meaning of the news,

245
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,850
uh, when the journey takes, um,

246
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:45,100
both an athlete but also a tragic
turn when they try to cross the river.

247
00:16:45,261 --> 00:16:49,640
When the bridge is gone, um, and
the museum as well as the pool.

248
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:53,480
Um, the, the, the, the
call across the river,

249
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,190
which they know they cannot do.

250
00:16:55,191 --> 00:16:59,810
So they are just looking at
this impending disaster. Um,

251
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,280
and once again,

252
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:06,050
the meals as emblematic of people who
know that something terrible is going to

253
00:17:06,051 --> 00:17:10,160
happen, but with absolutely know
how to stop that from happening.

254
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:15,320
The Mayo stand, the fourth
quarters already sloped a little,

255
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:19,690
the realms high, they
do our breathing. Now,

256
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:24,700
the dean who groaning sound looking
back once the gays sweeps across those

257
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:28,070
within the eyes are wild,

258
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:33,280
sad profile and despairing quality as
though they had already seen in the thick

259
00:17:34,371 --> 00:17:36,770
water the shape of the disaster,

260
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,490
which they could not speak
and we could not see.

261
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:44,200
So I think the anti convention,
um,

262
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:48,500
is in fact the entire ancient Greek
physician is involved in two ways,

263
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,340
both in,
um,

264
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,350
the muse as in many ways
and the medic of humans. Um,

265
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:58,830
but also in the function as a
tragic corals, right? You know,

266
00:17:58,831 --> 00:18:03,780
that this is a structural feature of in
Greek tragedy, um, chorus looking on,

267
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,900
um, knowing that the
catastrophe is about to head,

268
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,350
but with athlete and no
ability to prevent this coming.

269
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,950
So that's what the meals are doing here.
That's the function.

270
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:18,980
That's the ethics function within this
La di very much associated with a kind of

271
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:23,280
reassigned but resilient attitude,
um,

272
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,030
that we're seeing with, um,
that we're seeing the towel.

273
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,070
But in this case the resignation
and the kind of pose no bravery,

274
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:37,440
um, the dose to holidays unrelated,
adequate to stopping, uh, the,

275
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,690
the,
the arrival of a catastrophe.

276
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,320
So in the next moment we sort
of see what happens to the news.

277
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:47,550
Um,

278
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:52,550
and this is in many ways in
play a logical conclusion of uh,

279
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:56,710
what they have already been aware of.
Um,

280
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:00,570
this is a completely unsurprising,
um,

281
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:05,690
ending to this sequence began by the
Muse as to tragic corridors between two

282
00:19:07,411 --> 00:19:10,410
hills.
I see the views once more,

283
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,890
they roll up out of the
water in succession,

284
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,600
turning completely over the legs.

285
00:19:17,601 --> 00:19:22,590
Stiffly extended as when
they had lost contact with,

286
00:19:22,591 --> 00:19:23,424
they were.

287
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:29,510
So this is in many ways a backward
gesture to that burlier happy moment,

288
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,380
uh,

289
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:39,380
when the Muse of fully contended and
fully capable of doing what they can do

290
00:19:42,871 --> 00:19:47,871
that then they all environment muse
are creatures with feet of clay.

291
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,670
That's was clear.

292
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:54,750
And this kind of sequence is
that because they are creatures,

293
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,490
we're feet of clay,

294
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:01,410
they can only survive when
they are on solid earth.

295
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,140
And when they own solid of,

296
00:20:03,141 --> 00:20:08,141
they are very good in making that
Earth projective and reproductive.

297
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:13,180
Um, so this is really what, how is
talking about is a very improved delta.

298
00:20:13,181 --> 00:20:14,014
The farmer,

299
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:18,720
he's also reproductively happy with Cora.

300
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,500
Um,
that is the nature,

301
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:27,650
but also to limit of a new
lighting systems is that
there are certain lines that

302
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:31,110
Muse cannot cross.

303
00:20:31,111 --> 00:20:36,111
They cannot transcend the own condition
as creatures with feet of clay.

304
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:40,880
They can only be okay. They,

305
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:45,480
and it really is no more than that.
They can be okay only within one setting.

306
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,000
And in this other moment,
uh,

307
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:54,190
when they left, the
customer is setting, um,

308
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:58,360
and they'll start trying to
negotiate with a swollen river. Um,

309
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:02,350
we know that the muse will not survive
in that kind of transformed setting.

310
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,730
So in many ways,

311
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:08,940
the perfect analogy for the poor wise
that they can do relatively well when

312
00:21:10,091 --> 00:21:11,680
they're left to their own devices,

313
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:14,470
when they allow simply to
stick to the environment.

314
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,650
But once they are taken
out of the environment,

315
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,320
then we know that terrible things are
gonna happen to them. Um, so in, in,

316
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:26,320
in this particular sequence, um,
how being associated with the Muse,

317
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:29,080
um, he's basically defenseless. Um,

318
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,680
he wants just to be allowed to live,

319
00:21:32,681 --> 00:21:35,850
live according to his own fashion.
Um,

320
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:40,920
that really is the basic requirement of
the muse is to be left alone and to be

321
00:21:41,021 --> 00:21:45,550
allowed to, uh, just to survive
as they, as they know how to do,

322
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,410
um, that is a very innocuous, um,

323
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:54,970
and in many ways have very sad portrait
or poor ways, but basically innocuous.

324
00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:00,660
But family really also has a somewhat
different image of whether poor white

325
00:22:01,961 --> 00:22:04,600
community,
my amount to,

326
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,720
and so he's not just going to give
us an image of pool wise as defense.

327
00:22:09,971 --> 00:22:14,320
There's, but basically non aggressive,
right? Abuse a completely non aggressive.

328
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:15,350
Um,

329
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:20,350
Faulkner does thing that the Ashley is
an element of aggression in a very close

330
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:23,830
knit community,

331
00:22:23,831 --> 00:22:27,670
especially the close knit community
such as the poor white community.

332
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:32,200
And we see that in the next
image of the parole ways. Um,

333
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,200
coming from,
not surprisingly from jewel,

334
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:40,230
this is how you things about his neighbors
and now them others saying they're

335
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,030
like buzzers waiting,
fanning themselves,

336
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:51,160
every bastard in the country
coming in to stare at her.

337
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,240
We've talked about hatred as a very
important emotion as the kind of emotional

338
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:00,250
bond within the family.

339
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,880
And we now see that hatred is also a
very important emotional bond within a

340
00:23:07,181 --> 00:23:10,930
small isolated community.
Um,

341
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,580
not only does to hate someone like
tell because they always think they are

342
00:23:15,581 --> 00:23:19,180
watching your every move,
not only those Jew hate how,

343
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,480
but he also imagines that there
is an element of aggression,

344
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,560
something that is not quite benign
coming from the neighbors. Um,

345
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:34,430
and that is really why he said
suspicious of them and you know, so, uh,

346
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:38,980
it be disposed was them
on his part. Um, and I,

347
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,930
the bosses actually will appear over
and over again for this thing. And,

348
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:48,200
um, the sound of theory, uh,
the buzz was collecting, uh,

349
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,780
around the body of the dog,
Nancy in the ditch. Uh,

350
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:57,220
and buses that band j imagines
would go and undressed is dad,

351
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:57,920
grandmother.

352
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:02,920
So buzzers have already appeared in
[inaudible] but in SLA dine buses as a

353
00:24:03,591 --> 00:24:07,100
physical presence would
be quite important. Um,

354
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:08,610
and also as a metaphor,

355
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:13,680
a president to talk about what your
neighbors might really be like in the

356
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:18,380
hearts,
not in our behavior but in the hos.

357
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:23,210
They might be just like buses
and he has an image. Awesome.

358
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:27,800
The buses to explain why. Uh, Jim, I
think that the neighbors are like them.

359
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,720
So,
um,

360
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:36,610
towers I said it's not obviously not
the main protagonists in as I lay dying.

361
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:37,340
Um,

362
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:42,340
but he is an important clue to what
Faulkner is trying to do because the way

363
00:24:44,721 --> 00:24:49,721
Faulkner portrays very important character
is almost exactly analogous to the

364
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:56,310
way he portrays.
Tell excepted what in,

365
00:24:56,311 --> 00:25:00,560
how is dispersed and sequence.
Um,

366
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:05,590
tell is sometimes identify with the neo
and sometimes identify with the buzzer.

367
00:25:06,951 --> 00:25:11,780
We don't actually see him being
simultaneously identify with both.

368
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:12,830
Um,

369
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:17,830
what is sequence and spaced out in town
would quite often be collapsed together

370
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:24,950
as one and Faulkner's
portray of [inaudible].

371
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:30,130
So in this moment we actually see
Julie being a lichen to two of animals,

372
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:36,440
not just one, not just his hose,
which is obviously the main creature.

373
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:40,640
Um, that is a fully that with, um,
not just the words, but something else

374
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:42,831
come here.

375
00:25:42,831 --> 00:25:47,510
So Joe says he moves
moving and quit his code.

376
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,493
Bunching,

377
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:52,670
tongue swelling like so many
flames we're tossing mean.

378
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:57,820
And to enrolling I the horse makes
another shot in rush and stops again.

379
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:04,310
Feet Bunge watching jaw,
jaw while stellate what him,

380
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,510
his hands at his size,
say food, Jews legs.

381
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:13,250
They are like figures.
Coffered her blow savage in the sun.

382
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,400
When jewel almost hugged him,

383
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:21,760
the horse stands on his hind legs and
slashes mean of WHO's as by an illusion of

384
00:26:21,951 --> 00:26:25,490
wings among them.
Beneath the up rear Chaz,

385
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,710
he moves with a flashing limberness,

386
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:32,840
a snake for instance,
before the Joe comes into his arms,

387
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:37,280
he sees his whole body.
Earth three horizontal.

388
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:42,350
We're paying snake limber until
he finds the horses nostrils.

389
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,030
And of again,

390
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:49,170
so many things to say about this moment.
The first,

391
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,130
and we were referenced back to the news
and the fact that they are creatures of

392
00:26:53,131 --> 00:26:53,964
clay,

393
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:58,740
is that Faulkner is based in the king
of very deep metaphoric distinction

394
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,450
between two kinds of animals.

395
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:05,600
They're animals like the muse who can
swim and can only survive when they are

396
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:09,900
honest, solid earth. Um, and
then there are other creatures.

397
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,340
The horse being the main example,
um,

398
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:17,390
who actually can leave earth
for non trivial length of time,

399
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:21,450
um, and they are able to survive
when they're not touching the earth.

400
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:26,870
So right here we know that Q is a very
different kind of person from tower.

401
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:31,560
Yes,
he is in a white,

402
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:35,100
poor white community or his
parents appeared to be poor white.

403
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,870
But for some reason there is something
else about [inaudible] that makes him

404
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:44,940
different, um, his more
horse life than you like. Um,

405
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,180
so this is a kind of a
backward reference, um, to, to,

406
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,080
to another input an animal in SLA dying.

407
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:55,590
But within the compass of
this particular passage,

408
00:27:56,010 --> 00:28:01,010
what is really interesting
is the simultaneous cope
presence of the horse and

409
00:28:03,241 --> 00:28:07,200
the snake. And for those
of us, the two of them,

410
00:28:07,201 --> 00:28:11,400
Ashley really are not that have light
coming in. And it's hard to think of,

411
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:17,370
you know, any kind of kinship really
between the horse and the snake. Um,

412
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:22,110
they look different and they have very
different connotations. Um, you know,

413
00:28:22,111 --> 00:28:25,530
in our common understanding
of those two animals.

414
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:30,750
So let's try to see what it is.
Then there was Faulkner,

415
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:34,650
um, to bring those two
animals together. Wellbeing.

416
00:28:34,651 --> 00:28:36,780
We know that the horse
is the winged horse.

417
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:40,260
So this is going back to the epic
physicians in illusion with wings.

418
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:44,430
This is not just a hose that
is, um, uh, earthly creature,

419
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,900
but seemingly one of the wing
hoses of Greek mythology. Um,

420
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,920
and certainly the causes acting,
uh, like a method because, um,

421
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:56,880
in that emotion, um, it's almost, uh,

422
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:02,220
beyond just the physical capability
of any earthly creature. Um,

423
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,480
so it is,
um,

424
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:09,620
the body in motion but not being register
as body lor but simply as bodily pause

425
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:18,740
coming into view when suddenly you are
seeing that bodily part but not really

426
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,040
the entire horse.

427
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:24,330
And that actually was the way the father
and was thinking of the horse as well.

428
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:29,320
Right in the, if we go
back to that moment, um,

429
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:34,140
in father representation
of the Horse in the barn,

430
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:34,710
um,

431
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:39,710
it was as though the dark where resolving
him out of his integrity into an

432
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,900
unrelated scattering of components.

433
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:46,120
So nothings and stampings,

434
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:50,800
smells of cooling flesh and have
all their errands a lot. So, uh,

435
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:55,840
vitamin has exactly the same
kind of scatter a representation.

436
00:29:56,110 --> 00:30:00,490
The horse is moving so fast that
we're not actually seeing or was, um,

437
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:05,440
as a single integrated being
but simply as different barley,

438
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:09,170
barley pause,
coming into view through emotion.

439
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:13,090
So really is less about the
body and as a part of his body.

440
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:18,080
Then about a kind of very fast and
with transcending kind of version. Um,

441
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:22,510
and that is really what,
um, how Jews who was,

442
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:25,600
is represented to us.
We don't see him as a horse.

443
00:30:25,601 --> 00:30:29,650
We simply see him as something
that is in constant motion.

444
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,810
But more than that,

445
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:37,260
it is the very and beggars relation
between Joel and the horse.

446
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:42,280
Um, obviously you lost
his horse, you know,

447
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:46,540
he's done a lot of work to get the horse.

448
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:50,170
It is very much his horse.
Um,

449
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:54,940
but it was not exactly an
affection relation, right?

450
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:59,440
Was,
it is a battle between two creatures,

451
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:00,810
very important.

452
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:05,860
Each other are the horse probably is
the most important creature to jewel.

453
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:10,840
Um, but there's no fashion
there. So what is the feeling,

454
00:31:10,841 --> 00:31:15,370
what is the emotional bond
between these two things? Um,

455
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:20,460
it is not common factor, which
is the most ordinary and, uh,

456
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,420
easily recognizable and
recognize human bond, um,

457
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,590
is not there.

458
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:31,650
What is this other emotion that is there
and it seems that we're thought new

459
00:31:32,111 --> 00:31:37,111
suggesting is that instead of the common
human affection is a snake like quality

460
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:45,350
that is binding cure to his horse.
Uh,

461
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:49,230
we don't know what emotions, snakes, um,

462
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:53,350
they're not credited with having
emotions either sneak in those,

463
00:31:53,351 --> 00:31:55,870
which isn't really an immersion.
Um,

464
00:31:55,930 --> 00:32:00,930
so we don't actually know what kind of
emotional bombs can come from snakes

465
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:07,090
abrasion or maybe simply of
hatred, but you know, but that is,

466
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:11,920
that is a kind of a general, general
thing. Um, it's not a benign, um, feeling,

467
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:12,783
that's for sure.

468
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:17,970
So right now let's just say that
we don't completely understand,

469
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:23,020
uh, what is going on here
or why this snake is afraid.

470
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,420
Put a supplement to the
relation between jaw and horse.

471
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:31,720
Um, we're bad ones again to what
we've been talking about earlier,

472
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:36,960
which is the narrative as a
secret bearing narrative register.

473
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,190
There's another social dialect.
This is with secrets.

474
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,740
That's what we're saying right here.
Um,

475
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:47,800
and just to highlight how unusual this
description of [inaudible] and the horse

476
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:54,200
is, just want to go back very briefly
to a contrasting moment in Hemingway.

477
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,180
Uh, when, once again,

478
00:32:56,181 --> 00:33:00,530
we see a human pair with an animal that
was very important to him in our time.

479
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,450
Um, this is the, or killing the
ball. When he started to kill it,

480
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,430
it was all in the same rush. The ball,
looking at him straight in front,

481
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:15,080
hitting the ball charge
and filotto charge.

482
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:18,950
And just for a moment they
became one for the other,

483
00:33:18,951 --> 00:33:23,150
became one little ball
and then it was over. Um,

484
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:27,140
in this passage in Hemingway,
actually the emotion,

485
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:31,640
the emotion of patrons is
quite important as well.

486
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,530
So in an odd way,

487
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:39,310
just like Faulkner Hemingway's
also interested in hatred
as a powerful emotional

488
00:33:40,401 --> 00:33:41,530
bond.
Um,

489
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,470
and that really is what
enables to go fight to go off,

490
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:50,890
but it is hatred so clear and so
transparent and so ritualistic.

491
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:59,680
And so ceremony is that it is also a
transform by that ritual into the Commons

492
00:34:01,931 --> 00:34:06,080
love really. So, um, and
Hemingway, it is very,

493
00:34:06,081 --> 00:34:10,370
very clear as the clarity of the,
and that is in the foreground,

494
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:14,960
there's really nothing more to say.
The ball and the matador has become one.

495
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:20,050
Hemingway keeps repeating that everything
is completely clear and there is no

496
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:24,170
secret whatsoever.
By contrast,

497
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,850
this is a secretive narrative,
um,

498
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:32,000
that flaunts his secret in our face.

499
00:34:32,001 --> 00:34:36,020
We don't really understand what's going
on and that is the prevalence of this

500
00:34:36,021 --> 00:34:38,780
kind of narration. So, um,

501
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,550
just to refresh your memory were
drawn inspiration from Frank Vamos,

502
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:48,500
a classic genesis of [inaudible] and um,

503
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:53,530
the moment where Foglar is highlighting
and dramatizing the existence of a

504
00:34:56,751 --> 00:35:00,980
sacred is by way of Joe's horse.

505
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:06,160
And this time is the fully dramatize
moment in the sense that not only is the

506
00:35:07,401 --> 00:35:11,780
horse, they are not only Joel there,
but everyone else is there. So this,

507
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:15,350
the entire tragic chorus,
uh, or maybe in this case,

508
00:35:15,351 --> 00:35:16,700
not completely a tragedy either,

509
00:35:16,701 --> 00:35:21,701
but the entire chorus is there witnessing
this dramatic exchange and it is no

510
00:35:21,921 --> 00:35:25,610
longer an exchange between Ngo
and the horse. But someone else,

511
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:30,230
Joel Masa looking at him,
I give,

512
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,060
give, give. Then she began to cry.

513
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,640
She cried hard not hiding the face,

514
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,620
standing there in a faded wrapper
looking at him and him on the hose,

515
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,460
looking down in her,
his face growing cold.

516
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:52,550
Those slick looking until you loved away
quake and cash came and Tajay you go

517
00:35:54,481 --> 00:35:59,460
onto the house, cash said, does he have
grounds to West for you? You go on.

518
00:35:59,461 --> 00:36:04,461
Now that night I found master named
decided bed where he was sleeping in the

519
00:36:05,641 --> 00:36:09,600
dark. She cried a whole lot,
maybe because she had to cry.

520
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:13,590
So required mainly because she
felt the same way about tears.

521
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:18,450
She did about this seat heating herself.
We're doing it,

522
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,730
hating him because she had to.
And then I knew that, I knew,

523
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:29,390
I knew that as playing as part
of the day I knew about do the,

524
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:35,050
so is the moment when the secret is
exposed and is exposed of course without

525
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:46,400
thought they'd ever coming close to the
very simple nature of that cigarette.

526
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:52,770
Um,
it is completely by way of this,

527
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:55,620
the tour around Joe's horse,

528
00:36:56,370 --> 00:37:01,370
the way we know that there is the secret
is that ad his response to a horse is

529
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:08,390
nothing like what would have been a
normal response to [inaudible] sun

530
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:13,730
disappears and night after night, you
know, people don't know where he goes. Um,

531
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:16,500
and then all of a sudden he
comes back with his horse. Um,

532
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:19,740
[inaudible] hood of
possession amount more ways.

533
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:23,460
Muse would be to stand the Alamos
to half a poor ways of horses,

534
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:27,690
not at all the thing to have
or that anyone could have.

535
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:30,980
So, um, this is a procession, um,

536
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:33,970
that is inappropriate for Paul Weiss.
Uh,

537
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:38,880
vitamins response is what
would it have been an ordinary,

538
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:42,030
completely understandable responses.
Let me ride a horse.

539
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:47,300
So volume it is reacting as anyone would
react and his response is by crying.

540
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:57,480
Um, which I guess is, could still
have been normal except that

541
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,830
the response then from too

542
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,090
is that his face is growing Cole.

543
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:11,600
And then he's looking at her
and the more he looks at her,

544
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:15,210
the more sick looking he becomes.

545
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:20,010
So that is not in the script at all.

546
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:24,180
If the horse had been anything

547
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:28,770
but a good event,
right?

548
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:32,280
If the pause has simply
been a joyous acquisition,

549
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:34,890
none of this would have happened.

550
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:40,500
So what is it that transforms a joy's
acquisition into something that people can

551
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:47,110
either cry about,
I'll be very uneasy about,

552
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:51,010
or something that requires
some degree of confidence,

553
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:56,040
which is what cash seems to be
doing here is this proud mother. Um,

554
00:38:56,140 --> 00:39:01,140
and add a ought to be a proud mother
and instead cash is talking to her as if

555
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:05,800
someday to terrible had happened to her.
Go on back to the house,

556
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:09,670
go on now to ground is too wet for you.

557
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,040
The solicitor,

558
00:39:11,041 --> 00:39:15,280
you coming from cash
is also an explicable.

559
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:20,440
So we can say that from every single
person to overreaction of addy,

560
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:24,070
the crying,
the sake looking expression on Jews phase,

561
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:27,700
the over illicitly or coming from cash.

562
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:32,940
All of those things are things that should
not be in the script but surprisingly

563
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:33,940
are in the script.

564
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:38,940
And then we know that there really is
something that could be named that can be

565
00:39:39,611 --> 00:39:43,650
identified and named. And even though, um,

566
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:47,080
dow is not going to name it for us,

567
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:52,500
he comes as close as he
can to saying that word.

568
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,160
Uh,

569
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:59,160
so the way he tells us is that I knew
that as playing on that day as I knew

570
00:40:03,131 --> 00:40:04,300
about do it.
Hell.

571
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:09,380
So right here we see a kind
of bad word reproduction. Um,

572
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,950
in terms of farmers characterization,

573
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:16,990
we know about doing nails pregnancy
out of wedlock first, right?

574
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,440
And this is the thing that Dow those
about is transparency with it is duly dose

575
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:31,620
out of wedlock pregnancy that is
being reproduced in her model.

576
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:37,890
This is the kind of interesting backward
reproduction like mother like daughter.

577
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:39,580
Um,

578
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:44,380
and in this case we know
about the daughter's condition
first and it's because

579
00:40:44,381 --> 00:40:49,330
now is exactly the same reaction now in
exactly the same degree of knowledge.

580
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:52,930
Now that we know that in fact,
what do we do?

581
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:57,580
Dell is doing now has been
done once before in the family,

582
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:01,600
her mother.
So a lot of things are hanging together.

583
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:06,750
The fact that Joel has a very
different height than can be explained.

584
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:12,190
The fact that you can require the
horse when nobody else in a poor work

585
00:41:12,191 --> 00:41:14,680
community that can be explained as well.

586
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:18,470
A lot of things are falling
into place with USCIS.

587
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:22,030
A suspicion that's nuts
just sneaking up on us.

588
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:27,960
And I think that this is really why the
snake is so important to father is that

589
00:41:29,141 --> 00:41:32,650
the discovery is knitting up on us.

590
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,720
It is sneaking up on everyone else.

591
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,830
This is a snake that is not,
um,

592
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:44,560
like the snake in, in, in
Dante, the snake that takes, um,

593
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:48,200
the possession of someone else. Although
there's an element of this as well.

594
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:53,590
But a snake that insinuates itself into
our consciousness and implore us to us,

595
00:41:55,940 --> 00:42:00,940
the degree of knowledge or the kind of
knowledge that maybe we would prefer not

596
00:42:01,551 --> 00:42:04,520
to have.
So this is really the very early snake,

597
00:42:04,521 --> 00:42:08,630
the snake that is the bearer of knowledge
coming to Adam and eve, um, that,

598
00:42:08,631 --> 00:42:10,880
that has been involved here.
Um,

599
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:15,710
and it's just too clearish the case just
to make everything very, very clear.

600
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:16,520
Um,

601
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:21,350
father now resource to
another epic invention,

602
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:25,440
um,
bringing at a back to life.

603
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:28,000
And so that she actually
gets to say something. Um,

604
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:33,250
and there is no other explanation
other than the license,

605
00:42:34,341 --> 00:42:39,341
the piloting license afforded by
the antics form that will allow for,

606
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,613
uh,

607
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:45,740
a completely non realistic representation
of the voice of a dead person and

608
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,530
otherwise realistic novel.

609
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:52,880
But that is relative license that
thought and is taking. So in a very,

610
00:42:52,881 --> 00:42:56,510
very strange moment,
basically at the very heart of SLA dying,

611
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:01,840
we see the voice of a addressing us and
talking about a past moment in her life,

612
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:08,680
I would think of sin as I was thinking
of the clues we both wore in the world's

613
00:43:08,721 --> 00:43:13,550
phase of the suit inspection
necessary because he was a,

614
00:43:13,551 --> 00:43:18,551
he and I was I to send the more other
and terrible since he was the instrument

615
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:25,900
or they by God who created the sin to
stand defy that sin he has created.

616
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:33,020
Why waited for him in the worst waiting
for him because he saw me before he saw

617
00:43:33,021 --> 00:43:36,710
me. I would think of him
as stressed in stand here.

618
00:43:36,711 --> 00:43:40,730
The more beautiful since the garment
which she had exchange with sin.

619
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:45,320
The sand defied, um, is um,

620
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:50,960
and the confession I guess as
close to her confession, um,

621
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:55,460
as we can gather about the
paternity of jewel. Uh,

622
00:43:55,490 --> 00:44:00,490
but that confession about the paternity
of Julio is characteristically couch in

623
00:44:03,441 --> 00:44:08,000
terms of a strange con of satisfaction,

624
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:08,990
um,

625
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:13,730
that any guests from this
particular kind of affair,

626
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:19,300
which is that the Garmin that her partner
in sin has exchange for that sin is

627
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:23,534
Ashley.

628
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:28,250
All the more beautiful because
it is sanctified by God.

629
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:32,730
So that houses who the father is running.
Um,

630
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:36,770
and um,
following as being tongue in cheek here,

631
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:41,900
the father we figure out is probably
which seal is the only likely candidate.

632
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:45,810
There's really no one else in that
small community of could be the father.

633
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:49,110
So they could only be one. Uh, but, um,

634
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:52,450
it turns out the Faulkner
naturally has taken his name, uh,

635
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:57,090
from a historic figure, a
fairly influential preacher. Um,

636
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:00,660
18th century. Appreciate
Benjamin Franklin. Um, send them,

637
00:45:00,661 --> 00:45:02,820
when he would go to here with Phil,

638
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:06,900
he would make sure that he will have very
little money on this person because he

639
00:45:06,901 --> 00:45:10,360
just know that he would empty out
his pockets. Uh, when he, when,

640
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:13,830
when he goes around and ask for donations.
And sure enough,

641
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:16,020
even though he takes very
little money with him,

642
00:45:16,021 --> 00:45:19,230
he always walks away with empty
pockets after review was done.

643
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:24,030
So that's a very powerful one of the most
famous preachers of the 18th century.

644
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:29,210
Um, and Faulkner has
recreated this preacher, uh,

645
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:33,580
but with a twist and SLA dying.
And this is his with you.

646
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:38,690
It was his hand that bore me safely
about the float that fan at me from the

647
00:45:40,231 --> 00:45:45,150
dangers of the waters. My horse
was frightened. Am I own hearts?

648
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:50,180
They only as the logs and the approved
the trees pour down upon my littleness,

649
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:55,770
but not my,
so I knew then that forgiveness was mine.

650
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,410
The flood,
the danger behind.

651
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:03,110
And as I rode on across the firm,
uh,

652
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:05,780
so,
um,

653
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:09,810
the bundling's unable to
cross the soul and river,

654
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:13,500
the muse
in the river,

655
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:19,220
one person is able to cross the river
because his horse is able to cross.

656
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:27,660
Um,
so this is the genealogy of the horse,

657
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:33,170
both as wholes and obviously
also is snake as well.

658
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:38,540
Full spectrum of meanings
of the creatures snake.

659
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:42,660
Um, uh, review to us in pieces.

660
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,900
And that is really the nature
of the narrative, right?

661
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:49,350
That we don't actually get
the whole picture all at once.

662
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:54,650
We see different bodily pause coming to
you with the emotion of this creature.

663
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,850
And uh, with this, um,

664
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:05,130
establish,
funnily establish kinship between Jews,

665
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:09,750
horse and with fields cause um,

666
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:14,350
in this case of very well behaved for
it's not a lot like the wild west of joule

667
00:47:14,351 --> 00:47:18,900
was also explains why, um,
with you is a minister, uh,

668
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,100
whereas a Jewess nothing like that.
Um,

669
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:27,140
so it's the wireless in the offspring
that actually backwards reproduces the

670
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:32,960
mostly law abiding but not completely
law abiding identity of the father.

671
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:40,270
Um, and just to add to
that, um, here is down.

672
00:47:40,271 --> 00:47:41,290
So then everything,

673
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:46,680
and this is the clearest indication that
the animal for Whitfield is also the

674
00:47:48,191 --> 00:47:49,330
horse on a horse.

675
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:54,540
He rode out to arms stairs and came back
on the hoses almost too heavy handed to

676
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:57,370
emphasize this detail over and over again.

677
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,950
I would have been
completely uncalled for of,

678
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:05,040
except for the fact that we really need
to have a narrative genealogy for jaw.

679
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:12,640
And it is a narrative
genealogy that is tall Ashley.

680
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,300
Not through,
not only through a human story,

681
00:48:16,301 --> 00:48:21,180
not only through the monologue
of, of, of, of, um, of added, um,

682
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:24,720
in this epic convention, uh,
of the desk speaking. Uh,

683
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:29,760
but there's also a parallel at the
convention of human story thread through

684
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:32,170
another human creature.
