JEFFREY FREEBURG:
So welcome Chef.

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.360
MAGNUS NILSSON: Thank you.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.610
Thanks for having me.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.170
So my plan was to first
introduce the restaurant which

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.450
I have in Sweden, and talk a
little bit about what we do.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.640
And then I was going to go more
deeply into how we work

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.250
with vegetables--

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.880
how we grow them and
how we store them.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.672
That was my plan.

00:00:23.672 --> 00:00:24.460
Maybe I can skip that.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.800
Probably people know
where Sweden is.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.630
But that's where Faviken
is, at least.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.140
You see?

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.160
I usually say that it's in the
northern parts of Sweden, but

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.940
it's actually in the middle
towards the Norwegian border.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:37.330
This is what we are.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:38.650
We're a tiny, tiny restaurant.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.770
We have like 12 to 16 people
dining, 5 nights a week.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.380
It's an ambitious restaurant.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.490
What we try to do up there is
to make the most out the

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.900
whatever possibilities we have--
and difficulties as

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.110
well, for that matter.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.490
Which manifests foremost
[? bit ?] because we only work

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.110
with products from this area.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:08.720
This area is very interesting
because it has inland climate

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.170
where we are.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.850
It's hot in the summer and
very cold winters.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.100
And then if you cross
[? the Scandinavian ?]

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.550
mountain range is very
close to us.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.110
Then you get to Norway where
you have coastal climates.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.330
You have a lot of different
things.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.310
A lot of diversity within
a very small region.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.120
And this is a question that
I very often get--

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.760
why do you work with products
from a certain area only?

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.920
Why don't you work with
products from

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.820
all over the world?

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.410
And the answer to that
is very simple--

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.580
it's actually quality.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.860
Our products-- they are
really, really good.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.040
It's the best products I've ever
worked with anywhere, in

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.390
any restaurant.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.480
It's not because they are from
the region as such--

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.980
because products don't
get better from--

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.150
but yes because they are
from a certain place.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.240
But it gets much better
because we can have

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.830
cooperation.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.570
We can have a dialogue with all
the people that produces

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:50.940
our food to the restaurant.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.250
We can give them feedback, and
they can tell us what works

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.060
for them, and not.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.800
And we can support each other
which brings progress and

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.050
development.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.960
Another question that I get very
often-- why do you have

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.830
so few seats?

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.090
Why is the restaurant so tiny,
especially now when we are

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.120
quite a well-known restaurant.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.900
We could probably fill it many
times over every night.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.620
But that's something that has
never really appealed to me

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.830
because I like the format.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.010
I like cooking myself.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.480
I don't like to train a huge
team to do my work.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.430
And also, I like the dining
experience that we can give

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.425
people which is a communal
dining experience.

00:02:25.425 --> 00:02:27.270
It starts at 7:00.

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.180
Everyone arrives at
the same time.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.880
Then we do a little bit
of matchmaking.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:31.750
We put people together.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.500
They sit together for drinks
for half an hour--

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.830
and some appetizers.

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.090
And then we move people upstairs
and you have your own

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.130
separate tables, like
in any restaurant.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.290
But the difference then is that
everyone will have the

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.430
same menu, at the same time,
at the same place.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.560
So everyone will share this
experience, and then be seated

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.510
again downstairs in front of
the fireplace afterwards.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.390
So this is our business.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.680
We employ 11 people in total.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.040
7 of them work in the kitchen,
and the rest in front of house

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.150
or with the hotel
which we have.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.000
It's a 6 room hotel, so
it's also very small.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.260
One of my chefs is responsible
for all produce--

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.180
he more or less does
only that.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.760
Because it takes a lot of work
to get all the stuff into the

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.500
restaurant.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.280
Not only to get the quality,
but actually to

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.080
get enough of it.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.750
Because even if the restaurant
is tiny, we serve about 3,000

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.110
people a year, and everyone
will have in

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.550
between 20 or 25 servings.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.590
So it makes up slightly over
60,000 plates a year-- which

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.770
is quite a lot, acutally.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:38.580
The number of how the work hours
in the restaurant is

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.700
split between the different
things we do, is also very

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:41.630
different from other
restaurants.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.520
Because in most other
restaurants people will work

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.590
with cooking only.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.730
They would be like 90% cooking
and 10% cleaning.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.710
But with us it's 50% working
with the produce before the

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.060
cooking starts, which is a lot
of work hours and a lot of

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.390
money for us-- it's
a tiny business.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.370
And this is mainly spent on
getting the produce in.

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.980
Driving around, talking to
people, developing our

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.260
relations with the community,
and getting all the

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.950
produce to the farm.

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.960
And also working in the storage
techniques which I'm

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.820
going to talk later about.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.339
So that was a little bit about
the restaurant and such.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:20.680
This is how we work the
vegetable year at Faviken.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.200
So if you start from
the bottom, you

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.790
see two blue lines.

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.710
And they show when in the year
we use a lot of forage

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.480
vegetables because this is
something that people always

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.040
put together with restaurants
from my area.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.320
There's always big focus on
forage, right now-- which not

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.150
always the case.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.360
It's just during a few, few
brief moments in a year.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.920
So you see that in May and
June-- that's the only, really

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.530
where we actually work with
the foraged vegetables and

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:48.040
foraged herbs.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.680
Just for 6 weeks maximum when
they are young and tender in

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.620
the spring.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.940
And then during midsummer we
don't really do that anymore

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.480
because they're not
delicious anymore.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.400
And there's really no need
because there's so much other

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.920
things as well, going on.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.170
And then the forage stuff-- it
comes back again in August,

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.000
and then it's not herbs and
vegetables anymore.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.470
Then there's mushrooms
and berries, mainly.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.480
And it continues all through
autumn and finishes in early

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.900
winter-- which is, more
or less, now.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.400
The red line--

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.280
it marks the time when we
actually have fresh vegetables

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.990
from the garden like most
restaurants would have every

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.960
day of the year, nowadays
because you transport things

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.600
all around the place.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.100
For us it's quite brief.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.870
We try to make the most out of
that time, so during that time

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.120
in the summer, everything is
about showing the produce in

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.410
their [? huest, ?]

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:35.110
freshest form.

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.760
So you can have a chef running
down to the vegetable garden

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.320
picking some peas, and more or
less popping the pod straight

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.330
on the plate and serving them.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.240
Well then in the winter--

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.410
if you look at the green line
which shows the time of year

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.180
where we have to use things that
are stored or prepared in

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.700
a way to keep--

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:53.770
it's all about something else.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.970
Because all those storing
techniques-- no matter which

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.130
you choose to use--

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.480
they will do something
to the product.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.970
It will make them less
of a product.

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:04.550
The carrot will be less of a
carrot because it's stored.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.150
It will be different.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:11.670
And that's something that
we try to embrace and to

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.550
incorporate into the cooking
during the winter.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.470
So it gives a very special
flavor and a very special

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.000
character to everything
we do--

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.250
a large part of the year.

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.630
This is about one kilometer
from the restaurant.

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.000
And this is quite typical--

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.930
how the grounds would look like
where we would forage in

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.420
the spring and early summer.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.810
So you see there's in the
valley you would have

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:35.700
coniferous forest.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:40.450
And then quite quickly as the
elevation goes up, it thins

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:44.250
out and you have more of this
low shrubs, and a lot lichens.

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:49.840
This is a little list of the
different wild vegetables that

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.240
we often use in the
restaurant.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.570
And I'm not going to go through
all of these because

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:56.080
there's so many.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.390
But if someone would have a
special interest in this, you

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:00.490
can email the restaurant and
I'll send it back to you.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:04.510
The vegetable gardens.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.520
This is something that I'm
very, very proud of.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.280
It was the first year--

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.340
which is now five years ago
that I work at Faviken--

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.110
I started a little
vegetable plot.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.070
And it was just like 20 square
meters or something like that.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:20.970
And I grew some onions, some
carrots, some beets, a few

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:23.760
sweet peas for the summer,
and a few more things.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:28.940
And I realized that it's the
ultimate way of seeing to you

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:30.660
that you have the best
possible vegetables

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:31.290
available to you.

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:34.740
Because you can influence so
many things just by choosing

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:38.920
different growing techniques
and different varieties of

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:39.500
vegetables.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.000
A carrot is not just
a carrot--

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.650
there's like hundreds
of varieties.

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:48.640
And within those varieties you
can also affect the end result

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:54.480
so much by when you harvest
them or how you grow them.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.130
Two different photos from
the same place.

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:58.600
One is in early spring when
everything is on its way up.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.930
And then one is about this time
of year, when the first

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:04.830
snow has arrived.

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:07.890
This is how it would look
like in the summer.

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:10.170
This is probably around
July last year.

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:17.960
This is how the vegetable
gardens are laid out.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.530
They're much larger now,
than when I started.

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:21.010
They grow a little
bit every year--

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:22.390
become larger and larger.

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:24.130
And that's mainly because,
for me, gardening

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:25.720
is a work in progress.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.060
It's a learning process--
the whole thing.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.490
Because there's so many
things to try to

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:30.380
understand and to learn.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:31.380
So we just add on.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.809
As soon as I find something
interesting, we

00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:34.580
add on a new section.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.419
And at this point, we have--

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:37.780
if you look to the left
a little [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.850
there's something where it's
labeled, "four part crop

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:44.169
rotation," which is four raised
beds in which we grow

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:50.520
four different kinds of plants
that take different nutrients

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.900
out of the soil to grow,
and that has different

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:57.720
sensitivities for viruses
and other dangerous

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.500
microorganisms.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:06.370
And we rotate them every year
to prevent buildup of those

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:10.090
microorganisms, and to prevent
depletion of soil nutrients.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.080
This is how that one looks.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.020
It's quite straightforward.

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.550
This is like any home garden
actually, this one.

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:19.680
The white stuff on top-- that's
just to prevent the

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.240
young seedlings from frost
in the summer.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.860
We take those off in mid-June.

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:27.680
In the middle we have a
different system which is

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.080
labeled the "six part crop
rotation," which raised

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.010
uncovered beds.

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:33.280
And that also has strict
irrigation.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.060
And this is a more intense
way of farming the land.

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:39.470
It gives us the possibility to
raise the soil temperature.

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:42.840
Because see that black stuff?

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.260
It's a black cloth which
we cover the soil in.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:50.690
And first it prevents moisture
to evaporate, but also it

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:52.290
raises the soil temperature.

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:53.390
So we are basically--

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:56.640
instead of having a subarctic
climate-- we are somewhere

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.060
like in the south of Sweden or
Denmark, where it has a much

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.570
more temperate climate.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:07.180
So here, every crop grows from
its own little hole.

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:10.460
Which it's a lot of work
to do this in spring--

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.060
to actually plant everything
and to set it up.

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:13.560
But then it's very good, because
you don't have to

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.960
spend a lot of time
cleaning out weeds

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.040
and things like that.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.500
But this we've seen.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:21.070
We followed this.

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:22.870
Now we've done this for three
years, and we followed it and

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:27.260
we see that we actually are not
able to put back all the

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.380
nutrients in the soil again
that we take out.

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:32.070
Because this is so intense, it
really produces a lot of

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:33.880
vegetables.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.420
And because we don't use heavy
machinery, it's all turned by

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.220
hand and it's all transported
by hand.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:43.070
We have a hard time putting back
all the organic nutrients

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:46.140
in the soil again which sooner
or later we're going to have

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:50.040
to change this practice
and do something else.

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.760
And then we have my favorite--

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:52.530
down on the right part--

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:55.110
which is in between
those ones.

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:56.870
It's a three part
crop rotation.

00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:59.400
30% of it is grown with
leguminous plants which are

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:03.950
not harvested, but instead
plowed down in

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:06.420
the soil every autumn.

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:10.090
Leguminous plants-- they have
bacteria growing on the roots

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:14.540
which has the ability to fix
nitrogen from the atmosphere.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:17.060
And you turn that down every
autumn, and let it rot into

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:20.500
the soil, and that's giving
back organic nutrients.

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:22.050
And this one is not covered
with [? claw fighter. ?]

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:26.240
It's covered with grass
clippings which serves the

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:30.720
same purpose, but it's much
nicer in [INAUDIBLE],

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.150
The herb gardens
look like that.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:34.880
The red building is
the restaurant.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.420
Kitchen would be in the middle,
and then the higher

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:39.340
part, in the back-- that's where
the dining room is on

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:40.060
the second floor.

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:43.850
The herb garden is where we
produce all the fresh flowers

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:46.760
and herbs for the summer, but
also everything that we dry

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:51.450
and store for the winter, in
terms of seasoning and herbs.

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:54.860
And this is the choice that one
has to do every time, when

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:58.360
one decides to store
a vegetable.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.800
Because there's basically
two different schools of

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:01.690
techniques.

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:05.800
Either you utilize some kind of
mechanism already present

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:10.070
in the plant that makes it
keep for a long time.

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:13.360
Or you kill the plant off and
everything within the

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.180
restricted atmosphere
around the plant.

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:20.270
The technique that kill the
plant-- they kill all the

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:20.940
harmful bacteria--

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:22.420
as I said-- in the restricted
atmosphere.

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:25.060
And that can be for example,
that you take a carrot and you

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:26.190
put it in the jar.

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:28.760
You fill the jar with some brine
or water or something,

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.880
and then heat-treat the jar.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:34.345
You bring it to 90 degrees And
keep it at 90 degrees for at

00:12:34.345 --> 00:12:35.220
least 10 minutes.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:40.580
And that will kill or disable
almost all microorganisms

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:43.060
within that jar.

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:46.150
And it can be other examples
like for example pickles--

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:47.400
also a killing technique.

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:53.510
The non-killing ones that are
interesting, in the way that

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:57.080
they use mechanisms already
present in the plant.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.520
And that is for example, all
root vegetables that we use

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.960
like carrots, and beets,
and things like that.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.300
They are biannuals.

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.940
Basically their life cycle is
that the first year, they will

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.830
sprout from a seed and
they will grow.

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:11.650
During summer they will collect
a lot of energy

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:14.080
through photosynthesis and store
this as chemical energy

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.460
in the root, in the form
of carbohydrates--

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.270
and that's the energy
we consume.

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:23.240
That's what we want to
use in the vegetable.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.340
Basically it does this just
because it wants to get ahead

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.040
in the race of life.

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:33.610
Because next spring, when it's
dormant during one winter, it

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:39.640
will be able to sprout
a flower before all

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.480
the one-year herbs.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:43.980
[? See this ?] doesn't have to
wait for the photosynthesis to

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:45.350
really get going in spring.

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:46.150
It can just go straightaway--

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:48.400
consume the energy it
has in the root.

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:51.940
And this is something we can
use if we just harvest the

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:55.220
plant at the right time, when
it's set on hibernation, when

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:58.930
it decided to go hibernate
for winter.

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:01.940
We can harvest it and we can
store it in an environment

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:06.280
which is similar to the
temperature and the humidity

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.680
and the soil-- it can
be a root cell or

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.930
something like that.

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:13.840
And this is something that
I find very interesting.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:17.390
And this took me while to
actually figure out--

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:20.690
that all the methods to prolong
the shelf life or to

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:22.650
store vegetable-- it never
makes them better.

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:25.070
It just makes them different.

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:27.530
And as I said before, a carrot
is never better as a carrot

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:30.946
than when it was just taken
out of the soil and eaten.

00:14:30.946 --> 00:14:33.900
But everything you do with that
carrot after you pick it

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:35.960
and take the first bite--
it will make

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:38.230
it less of a carrot--

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:41.140
which is not always a bad
thing, but it's a fact.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:48.090
So here's a few specific
techniques.

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:51.370
So this is how we can keep for
example, broccoli, kale, and

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:52.390
cabbage, in a winter garden.

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:54.180
Because many of the
brassicas--

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:57.940
they produce different
agents in them that

00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:59.030
keep them from freezing.

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:01.116
They contain a lot of sugars,
and sometimes even a little

00:15:01.116 --> 00:15:03.000
bit of alcohol.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.610
And they keep on metabolizing.

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:08.010
Even though they are frozen,
they keep on

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:09.240
metabolizing just a bit.

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:12.280
So it's very fascinating because
if you take a broccoli

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:15.760
like that, that you left in the
garden, on the plant, that

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.660
has been frozen for like 1 and
1/2 months, and harvest it,

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.620
and you take into your kitchen,
it's still a fresh

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:22.200
broccoli when it defrosts.

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.360
But if you take same broccoli
and you freeze it for one and

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.360
a half months, and you defrost
it in the kitchen, then it's a

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.500
frozen broccoli.

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.100
I find that very fascinating.

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:34.820
And we just leave all those
brassicas in the garden and we

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:38.200
keep on harvesting them until
they run out or until the

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:41.185
moose eat them all.

00:15:41.185 --> 00:15:42.520
Clamping.

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:45.220
So this is a way of using that
mechanism that I talk about

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:48.070
earlier-- the biennal thing--

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:51.240
and this is probably the first
way that we humans stored

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:54.180
vegetables in any efficient
manner.

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:55.910
And basically what to do is
that you harvest all your

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:59.950
roots, you bring them close to
your house, you make these few

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:03.985
trenches, and then you put
some straw between the

00:16:03.985 --> 00:16:06.540
trenches, you put all the root
vegetable there, cover it with

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:10.330
more straw to insulate it, and
then you cover it with soil.

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:13.357
And this will keep a very, very
steady temperature over

00:16:13.357 --> 00:16:16.020
winter because those vegetables
that are set on

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:17.380
hibernation-- they're not
dead, they're still

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:18.100
metabolizing.

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:20.210
So they actually consume a
little bit of energy and

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:21.530
produce a little bit of heat.

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:25.390
So they will keep in there from
freezing-- even in our

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:27.176
subarctic climates--

00:16:27.176 --> 00:16:29.150
and also the humidity,
because it's placed

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:30.275
straight on the soil.

00:16:30.275 --> 00:16:33.050
It will keep very, very steady
and level all through winter--

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:36.430
which is important when
you store vegetables.

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.140
The only problem with this
is that you can't

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:38.930
really just take one.

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:40.870
You have to take them all out of
there when you break it in

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:43.290
the winter which can be
slightly impractical.

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:46.560
And that's why you have the root
cellar-- which is in my

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:49.030
opinion, one of the best ways
of storing vegetables.

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:50.760
It works with the
same principle.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.390
You keep a very steady and
level temperature.

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:54.380
It's dark.

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:58.160
And you have the same humidity
as the plant would experience

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:01.460
in its growing environment.

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:04.170
Inside the root cellar we
would store our root

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:06.040
vegetables like this--
buried in sand.

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:11.930
The sand helps preventing
fluctuations in temperature

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:12.910
and humidity even more.

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:15.343
So you get an even more level
climate for the vegetables.

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:20.900
Other things which
are not roots--

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:22.579
like for example, cabbage--

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:26.900
they are strictly not speaking
biannuals, but they have some

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.070
of those functions anyway
because it's just about

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:29.810
surviving for them.

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:32.360
Because if they would not flower
the first time or they

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.500
would be able to-- under
certain circumstances--

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.220
survive until next summer, and
continue the life then.

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:38.830
That's something we
also can use.

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:42.090
So we can harvest the cabbage
when it's ripe.

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:44.430
We can put it in the cellar
and leave it for that.

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:48.040
After about 6 or 8 weeks it
will dry and look like

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.400
parchment paper on
the outside.

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.420
It would be like
a little skin.

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:53.340
Then after--

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:54.660
I would say--

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:56.250
2 more months, it's all moldy.

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:57.510
Looks horrible.

00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:58.390
And it looks like something
[? it ?]

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:00.240
[? was ?] throw out of your
fridge straightaway if you

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.270
found it there.

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:03.380
But the fact is that if you just
take that skin off, there

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:05.870
would still be a fresh and
healthy cabbage on the inside

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:08.310
because it's layered.

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:10.800
And those layers-- they protect
the layer underneath

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:11.900
from damage from bacteria.

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:14.240
Because the bacteria have
to travel around

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.440
each bend in layers.

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:18.440
So it's a very long way
to go for them.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.540
And if you keep them all through
winter, new little

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:22.780
tiny cabbages will start
sprouting from the root stalk.

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:28.700
Oh, yeah the leek machine.

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:31.450
I read a report from the
Swedish University of

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:35.780
Agriculture a few years ago
which basically said that you

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:39.640
can store leeks for up to 290
days if you had the perfect

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:40.280
surrounding.

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:42.170
Like the perfect environment
for them.

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:47.550
And that was 90% humidity
and 0.1 degrees.

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:50.070
You can store them for 290 days
without significant loss

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:50.840
of quality--

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:52.950
which is very interesting
to me.

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:55.760
You have the very, very high
humidity to keep them from

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:56.460
drying out.

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:58.970
And you have the very low
temperature to slow down their

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:01.940
metabolism so they don't really
change that much.

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:04.930
So what I did was that I bought
the domestic freezer

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:08.850
and I tampered with the
thermostat so it keeps 0.1 to

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:11.480
0.3 degrees Celsius.

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.512
And I filled it with a little
bit of sand, and I harvested

00:19:13.512 --> 00:19:15.220
all the leeks and then
replanted them

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.400
in the sand, again.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.720
And then I left it all
through winter.

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:18.290
And this [? has ?]

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:20.130
[? stood ?] there so long so
that all the other people

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:23.530
working on the estate-- they
just saw it as sort of a

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:25.000
permanent installation
there in the corner.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.100
So it's covered.

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:28.010
When we used the leeks in the
spring this is how it looked.

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:29.930
It was covered in all
kinds of crap.

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:34.360
Onions and garlic.

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.610
They can be dried.

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:40.490
Most times when you buy onions
and garlic, the leaves have

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:44.020
been cut when they were still
green, and then you can never

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.040
store them for more than
maybe two months.

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:48.070
Because as soon as you cut them
there, you will have an

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:51.610
entryway for mold, spores,
and bacteria.

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:53.110
But if you leave them--

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:55.000
like those garlic lying out--

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.930
exposed to UV radiation,
they will die.

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:01.190
And they will seal themselves
off, and they will wait for

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:02.360
next summer.

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.620
So then when these are dry,
then you can cut them.

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:07.400
You can store for a very long
time in a dry and cool

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:08.800
environment.

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:10.440
Basically you can store
them for two years.

00:20:13.122 --> 00:20:15.810
Pasteurizing is one of those
techniques that will kill the

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:19.770
plant and also everything else
in the surrounding area.

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:20.530
These tomatoes--

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:24.940
they are pasteurized in brine.

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:26.960
It's a technique that were
very, very common in

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.760
households just until 50 or 60
years ago, and then people

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:32.360
stopped because it was
so easier to buy.

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:34.340
People started having domestic
basis freezers and things

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:36.110
[INAUDIBLE] so it was much
easier to buy the produce from

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:37.930
a supermarket.

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:39.070
But it's a very good
technique.

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:40.550
It'll produce an excellent
result.

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:43.760
It can be a little bit dangerous
because of the

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:46.470
bacteria that can survive in
there which are [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:49.880
botulinum, which gives botulism,
which will result in

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:53.180
you being dead if
you eat them.

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:56.490
But it can be avoided very
easily by respecting a few

00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:57.390
very simple rules.

00:20:57.390 --> 00:21:01.230
And one is that you can either
keep the pH level under 3.84

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:02.835
because then they cannot grow.

00:21:02.835 --> 00:21:05.850
And that can be done by adding
something acidic.

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:08.270
You can keep the tempter under
four degrees at all times

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:10.000
after the cooking.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.690
And that will keep them
from growing as well.

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:16.900
Or if you're uncertain that you
have been able to do those

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:19.720
two factors, you can also
heat the product

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:20.690
before eating it again.

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:22.880
You can heat it to 80 degrees
and keep it there for five

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:27.350
minutes, and that will destroy
all toxins as well.

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:28.390
Pickling in vinegar--

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:31.530
It's a very, very safe method
of preservation.

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:34.480
And it works by lowering the pH
level by adding some kind

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:37.310
of chemical agent-- for example
vinegar or lemon juice

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:38.320
or whatever.

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:43.240
Very few bacteria can grow in
a sour or acid environment.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:45.380
Pickling by lactobacillus
fermentation--

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:48.790
it works sort of in the same
way, but instead of adding a

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:54.080
chemical, you try to make the
lactobacilllus already

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.420
present, thrive.

00:21:55.420 --> 00:22:00.320
And that's usually done by
adding salt which suppresses

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:03.770
other bacterial activity which
gives the lactobacillus an

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:04.830
unfair advantage.

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:06.980
And then they start growing.

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:10.730
And then by consuming
carbohydrates they also

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:15.060
produce lactic acid which lowers
the pH level under 3.94

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:17.880
in quite a short
period of time.

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:20.500
And this can also be a little
bit risky because if it takes

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:22.730
too long, you can have the
same problem as with the

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:24.010
pasteurized foods--

00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:25.800
that you have other bacteria
growing as well.

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:28.800
And that will probably be
e.coli or [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:32.100
which are not good--
any of them.

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:34.010
And drying herbs and mushrooms
is something we do

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:35.580
quite a lot as well.

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:37.970
What's important when you're
drying is to dry very, very

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:40.280
quickly, and in a cool
temperature.

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:43.040
Because if you dry them in an
oven, they taste like hay, or

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:45.280
they all taste the same,
no matter what you do.

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:49.010
If you dry them in room
temperature in your room, they

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:51.020
decay so much from enzymatic
breakdown.

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:53.070
So you kind of transform
the flavor a lot.

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:55.300
Like if you're drying mushrooms
at room temperature

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:58.480
for a week, they taste
like soy, almost.

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:01.120
If you do it with herbs, they
lose all the green color and

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:02.270
all those fresh aromas.

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:07.355
So we use one of of these which
is an industrial grade

00:23:07.355 --> 00:23:08.230
dehydrator.

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:11.240
It takes about 15 liters
of water away from the

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:13.170
atmosphere per hour.

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:17.740
We keep it in a room, which
is more or less airtight.

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:22.460
It enables us to dry out about
10 kilos of herbs in more or

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:26.420
less two hours at 18 degrees
Celsius which preserves all

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:29.240
the very, very fragile aromas
and all the beautiful color.

00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:37.180
Using antibacterial properties
naturally present in plants is

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:39.050
an interesting way of
working that we

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:40.230
haven't used that much.

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:42.300
And on the photo you have
some lignon berries.

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:45.460
Lignon berries are naturally
very high in benzoic acid

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:47.600
which is something that the
food industry would add to

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:51.240
food to prevent mold
from growing.

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.895
And basically what you can
do is you can take lignon

00:23:52.895 --> 00:23:54.800
berries, put them in a jar,
cover them with water, and

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:55.850
then keep them for years.

00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:58.630
They never go bad, and they
change very little in texture

00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:00.970
and flavor as well, which
is interesting.

00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:02.210
You can also put things
in there.

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:05.980
You can put half a cabbage in
the box with lignon berries.

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:09.030
And it will also keep for two
years without much happening

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:13.340
with it except that is pink
in the end, obviously.

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:15.300
Leguminous plants--

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:16.270
something that we use a lot.

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:16.750
It's very versatile.

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:19.300
You can use them from the first
little sprout in spring

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:26.250
in a salad to peas and beans
in the summer, and then all

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:30.500
the way to using the mature
crop-- which has been dried,

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:31.080
[? trashed ?]

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:33.260
and stored for a long time.

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:37.450
Or as here-- ferment them,
like you do with miso for

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:40.970
example, in many Asian
countries.

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:44.840
Basically what we do is we have
a dried brown bean or pea

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:48.190
which is steamed for a long
time to kill any other

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:50.860
bacteria or mold
growing on it.

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:53.520
And then we infect it with a
particular mode which is

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:58.100
called aspergillus oryzae
which, when it grows it

00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:01.700
produces an enzyme that breaks
down protein into glutamic

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:04.070
acid which is very savory
and delicious.

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:06.040
So that will be like
miso in the end.

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:09.350
But not with soybeans but
with other beans.

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:10.600
That was it.

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:13.290
JEFFREY FREEBURG: All right.

00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:13.630
Thank you.

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:14.880
MAGNUS NILSSON: Thank you.

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:19.875
JEFFREY FREEBURG: Definitely
the most unique

00:25:19.875 --> 00:25:22.020
chef we've had here.

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:22.490
No, seriously.

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:24.820
But how did you get started
with this process?

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:26.970
I mean when you opened your
restaurant did you have all

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:28.815
these things in place or--

00:25:28.815 --> 00:25:29.170
MAGNUS NILSSON: No, no.

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:29.510
Definitely not.

00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:30.080
not.

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.120
But many of them--

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:36.195
I saw them being used when I
grew up in this area which has

00:25:36.195 --> 00:25:38.540
been very good at keeping
its old traditions.

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:42.710
And I never learned them back
then, but I saw them, and I

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:44.700
got interested in them, and
started learning about them.

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:47.620
Started implementing them
in our environment.

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:49.270
JEFFREY FREEBURG: Yeah, so is
your restaurant pretty much

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:52.030
100% sustainable?

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:53.370
MAGNUS NILSSON: Depends on how
you see it. our customers are

00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:55.480
not because most of our
customers are flying from all

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.490
over the world.

00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:59.370
JEFFREY FREEBURG: OK, that's
a good answer.

00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:02.470
So I ask every chef that comes
to Google this question--

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:05.350
what do you think the kitchen
of the future is going to be

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:06.850
like in let's say, 50 years?

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:09.970
Are we going to be only
cooking on electric--

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:11.330
or what do you think?

00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:13.180
MAGNUS NILSSON: Well I already
cook on electric, actually.

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:16.600
But I think that's obviously
impossible to answer.

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:19.060
And I think you can only say
what you hope for it to be.

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:22.610
And I hope for it to be much
more diverse than it is today.

00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:25.620
I hope for people to look
more within what they

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:26.580
have in their area.

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:29.740
To be more focused on what
possibilities and difficulties

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:33.260
they have, and what really
interests them, rather than

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:34.910
looking on what everyone
else is doing.

00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:36.416
Because that's something that's
very common today.

00:26:36.416 --> 00:26:37.770
JEFFREY FREEBURG: Yeah,
good answer.

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:40.540
So I heard that you actually
didn't want to start a

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:43.970
restaurant before you started
this-- is that correct?

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:46.320
MAGNUS NILSSON: For a while
I stopped cooking-- yeah.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.100
And I studied wine.

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:49.190
JEFFREY FREEBURG: So why
did you decide to

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:52.000
go back and do this?

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.710
MAGNUS NILSSON: Basically I
lived in France for a while,

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:56.120
and then I moved back to Sweden,
and I stopped cooking

00:26:56.120 --> 00:27:02.290
because it was not
so pleasant.

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:03.942
Everything looked like what
my [INAUDIBLE] in

00:27:03.942 --> 00:27:04.940
Boston, but less good.

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:08.250
Because I was less good than
him, and the produce I had at

00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:11.340
hand was much less good than
what he had in France.

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:13.950
So that's why I stopped
cooking and I

00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:14.570
started studying wine.

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:18.080
Because my idea was to
become a wine writer.

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:22.620
And after finishing that I was
offered a 3 month job at

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:27.180
Faviken, working with the family
who owns the estate to

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:28.940
more or less work with
the wine cellar.

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:32.010
And buy some wine, teach them
how to administer the wine

00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:34.050
cellar, and then go on.

00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:37.670
And then I stayed.

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:39.990
JEFFREY FREEBURG: So I heard
that you wrote the book in a

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:41.170
very short amount of time--

00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:42.306
4 months--

00:27:42.306 --> 00:27:42.980
how was that?

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:46.130
MAGNUS NILSSON: I started a
little bit earlier, but then

00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:46.850
it was very interesting.

00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:49.430
I had a lot of things that I
wanted to say, apparently.

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:51.740
JEFFREY FREEBURG: Yeah, it's a
beautiful book, by the way.

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:55.340
All right, well, I want to
open it up to Googler

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:57.206
questions so please, if
you have a question,

00:27:57.206 --> 00:27:59.960
step up to the mic.

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:02.620
Don't all rush at the
same time, please.

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:05.530
MAGNUS NILSSON: All 15 of you.

00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:07.150
AUDIENCE: So since you're
a wine guy--

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:09.360
I mean, wine and beer
are essentially

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.150
ways of also storing--

00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:12.200
MAGNUS NILSSON: Definitely.

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:12.860
AUDIENCE: --foods.

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:16.710
So do you have plans of going
in that direction as well?

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:17.630
MAGNUS NILSSON: It's funny
you're asking because I

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:20.680
actually just brought a brewery
like two months ago.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:22.681
And it's being dismantled right
now, and it's going to

00:28:22.681 --> 00:28:23.340
be shipped to Faviken.

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:26.870
And this winter we're going
to learn how to use it.

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:27.860
And then next year, we--

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:30.250
I already ordered the barley
that we're going

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:33.510
to plant and grow.

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:34.340
Hopefully it's going
to be a very

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:35.520
interesting learning process.

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:39.320
AUDIENCE: So you're very focused
on cooking locally and

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:39.910
eating locally.

00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:42.790
But what is it about the area
around Faviken that you find

00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:44.845
most exciting?

00:28:44.845 --> 00:28:45.560
MAGNUS NILSSON: I don't know.

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:50.200
I think I find it exciting
because I grew up there.

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:53.230
I spent a large part of my life
there, and I thought I

00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:54.670
knew everything about it.

00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:57.500
And then when I got back after
being away a while, and

00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:00.620
started working there, and
started working this way, I

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:03.110
realized that I knew very
little about this area.

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:05.890
And there's still so much left
to understand and to discover

00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:07.160
and to learn about--

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:08.410
which is fascinating.

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:15.510
AUDIENCE: So you told us a lot
about vegetables, but so

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:19.200
what's your approach
to fish and meats?

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.940
MAGNUS NILSSON: So that's
like two more talks.

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:25.040
But I can do it very,
very briefly.

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.680
With fish--

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:28.310
all the fish that we work
with-- it comes

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:29.370
from the same company.

00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:32.620
It's family owned, and it's on
the coastline in Norway about

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:35.400
2 hours from the restaurant.

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:37.992
All the fish is cough
on hook and line.

00:29:37.992 --> 00:29:41.210
And we work with species that
are red-listed which is

00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:44.830
slightly controversial today in
restaurants Because I think

00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:47.990
that the problem is not the fact
that there's very little

00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.430
of some fish.

00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:50.890
The problem is the way
that they are fished.

00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:53.470
And I like to support this
company which fishes in a way

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:56.110
that if everyone fished like
them, we would have very

00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:57.570
little of the problems
we have at the

00:29:57.570 --> 00:29:58.910
world's fish docks today.

00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:00.700
So we work with them.

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:04.780
And then we work with a few
small fishery businesses in

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:07.210
the area, as well as supply
freshwater fish.

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:09.000
For meat--

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.800
all the meat comes from
people we know.

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.210
There are a few farms that
we work with in the area.

00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:15.930
And we have sheeps
on the estate.

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:17.930
And I also live on a
farm where I have

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:19.290
sheeps, poultry and bees.

00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:23.550
So some of the stuff comes
from there as well.

00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:25.440
And what's different in the way
that we work with meat is

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:27.150
that the only buy
whole animals.

00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:28.980
And you buy them when
they're alive.

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:30.950
We pay the farmer--

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:33.480
when he has something he calls
me, and we go there--

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.550
either me or someone else
from the kitchen.

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:37.550
We look at the animal, and then
we decide if we're going

00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:38.150
to buy it or not.

00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:40.180
But if we buy it, we buy
it there and then.

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:42.230
And that's about six months
before it goes to the

00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:43.880
slaughterhouse.

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:47.320
And then we pay them a premium
to take care of the animal in

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.370
a way that we like in the end.

00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:51.750
And then we take it to
the slaughterhouse.

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:54.760
And we take care of that whole
logistical process to secure

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.110
the quality that we want.

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:01.020
JEFFREY FREEBURG: So I love
your whole approach.

00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:03.520
What does your restaurant
look like in a year?

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:06.220
Are you going to be doing
more covers--

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:07.355
MAGNUS NILSSON: No, it's going
to be the same but it's going

00:31:07.355 --> 00:31:08.870
to be much better.

00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:11.490
JEFFREY FREEBURG: And how is
it going to be better?

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:13.265
MAGNUS NILSSON: We've developed
during the last two

00:31:13.265 --> 00:31:17.630
or three years we've developed
a system which we work within

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:20.460
which I'm finally quite
happy with.

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:22.830
The format and logistical
system surrounding the

00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:24.430
restaurant, the way we
work with produce,

00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:25.460
and all that stuff.

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:28.290
And now the really fun
part has just begun.

00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:32.300
And that's when we start to
develop within this system.

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:33.760
So that's going to be
a very interesting.

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.265
There's so much to do yet.

00:31:35.265 --> 00:31:36.515
JEFFREY FREEBURG: Yeah,
very impressive.

00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:39.655
AUDIENCE: Do you have
any favorite

00:31:39.655 --> 00:31:41.120
restaurants in San Francisco?

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.370
I've never been to
San Francisco.

00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:45.200
I came like midday today,
and I'm going

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:46.350
into the city tonight.

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:49.610
But I'm going to cook at Qua
the day after tomorrow.

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:53.600
Which is going to be
very interesting.

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.420
I've never been to California
before.

00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:56.830
JEFFREY FREEBURG: Well you
came in a good week.

00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:58.700
So what are some of
your favorite

00:31:58.700 --> 00:31:59.870
restaurants in America?

00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:00.500
Do you have any?

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:02.270
MAGNUS NILSSON: Oh, that's
so difficult to answer.

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:05.350
There are so many good
restaurants and they are so

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:05.980
different from each other.

00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:09.760
So I don't think I have
a good answer there.

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:11.690
AUDIENCE: Seems like you really
pride yourself on being

00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:12.320
different--

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:13.730
and you said, strange--

00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:17.280
and not really looking out
at other people and

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:17.740
what they're doing.

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:19.440
So what is your creative
process like?

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:22.110
And where do you get you're
new ideas from?

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:25.240
MAGNUS NILSSON: I think that the
most important thing when

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:27.510
you're working any professional
craft where

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:31.640
there's an amount of creativity
involved is to

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:33.060
master your skills.

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:35.910
Like to really, really
understand and master your

00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:38.000
techniques that you use.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.800
Because that enables you to be--
at least enables me-- to

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.260
be intuitive.

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:43.320
And that's how I work.

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.260
The creative process
is very intuitive.

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:47.886
And then I might get interested
in the subject and

00:32:47.886 --> 00:32:51.030
I just go all in for that and I
contact all the people that

00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:52.410
know the most about
this subject.

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:56.890
And I start researching it
myself, and I start working

00:32:56.890 --> 00:32:58.140
with it and trying
to understand it.

00:32:58.140 --> 00:32:59.760
But that's not for me,
the creative part.

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:03.740
That's just creating the tool
or producing the tool to be

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:06.300
creative in the end.

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:08.850
That was a very strange
answer, but anyhow.

00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:10.530
JEFFREY FREEBURG: So how hard
is it to get into your

00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:11.680
restaurant?

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:13.520
MAGNUS NILSSON: We take
reservations 90 days ahead at

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:14.260
the maximum.

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:18.690
So if you want to come to
the restaurant just

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:20.542
[? hang on lock ?] when the
reservations open, and there

00:33:20.542 --> 00:33:21.918
shouldn't be much
of a problem.

00:33:21.918 --> 00:33:22.754
JEFFREY FREEBURG: OK.

00:33:22.754 --> 00:33:23.590
All right, great.

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:26.050
Any more questions?

00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:29.810
OK, he'll be up here to sign
the books if anyone wants

00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:30.760
their cookbook signed.

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.100
So, thank you very much.

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:32.670
Thanks for coming.

00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:33.920
MAGNUS NILSSON: Yeah, thanks
for having me here.
