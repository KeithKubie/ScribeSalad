MARK DYBUL: So I did
want to be really brief,

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:04.751
and I'm going to be even
less coherent than usual

00:00:04.751 --> 00:00:08.210
because I was in India yesterday
and I'm a little out of it.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.170
But it's a great opportunity
to talk with you a little bit

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.720
about-- less about the
Global Fund, per se,

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.129
and more about
amazing opportunity we

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.420
have in the world today
around HIV, TB, and malaria,

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.365
and more importantly what that
means for us as human beings.

00:00:23.365 --> 00:00:24.990
A little bit about
innovation, and then

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.730
just have a
conversation, I hope--

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.020
and hopefully you're all
more awake than I am.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.810
So AIDS, TB, and malaria.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.150
So these are pretty amazing
diseases in some ways.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.940
For those of you who don't know,
and probably most of you do,

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.240
TB and malaria have been around
since recorded medical history,

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.960
literally thousands of years.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.740
You can go back as
far as you want,

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.100
and you'll find evidence
of malaria or tuberculosis.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.450
And they've been hugely
impactful in human history.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.545
And HIV is kind of the
modern-- not kind of-- it

00:00:58.545 --> 00:01:01.080
is the modern-day plague.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.730
It's the disease that's really
had a massive social impact

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.850
in the world, really since 1980.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.470
Now a lot of you
may have been born

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.060
and don't even remember
a world without HIV.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.920
But some of us do,
and it's really

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.720
a radically different place.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.700
I happened to be
in San Francisco

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.640
during the worst time
when-- for those of you who

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.980
go to San Francisco now
to go to your mothership,

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.390
it's hard to describe how
different a place it was.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.169
I mean, it was actually
a depressing city

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:35.210
where you didn't even want
to be because everyone

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.580
was dying all the time, and
life revolved around funerals.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.680
It was actually a
terrible place to be.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.640
But because of
advances in science,

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.060
because of massive investments
started really by the United

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.597
States under President Bush,
but then taken up globally,

00:01:53.597 --> 00:01:55.180
because of the
leadership we're seeing

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.880
in the countries themselves,
we actually are on the verge of

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.180
and have the capability
to do something

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.720
that seemed impossible 15 years
ago, which is actually end them

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.910
as epidemics-- remove
malaria and tuberculosis

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.620
from the planet, which
again, that's been around

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.620
for thousands of years.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.940
And while we can't eliminate
in the same way HIV,

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.070
yet, we can bring it
down to such low levels

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.500
that people wouldn't even
have to talk about it anymore,

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.784
what we call
epidemiological control.

00:02:29.784 --> 00:02:32.200
There's a really fancy term
for it I won't tell you about,

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.790
but low level endemicity.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.960
And then when we get a
partially effective vaccine,

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.000
that would be it.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.310
So that's really cool, right?

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.560
I mean, these are things
we actually can end.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.470
It takes a lot of work,
takes a lot of effort,

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.720
and takes a lot of focus,
but we can actually do it.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.830
And this is the first generation
that's had that capacity.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.790
This is the first
generation in thousands

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.180
of years that's had the
ability to end tuberculosis

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.110
and malaria.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.120
And this is the first time we've
had the ability to end the HIV.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.430
When everything started about
15 years ago around HIV,

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.300
it really was
stopping the death.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.540
It was just trying to stop
the hemorrhage and the death

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.850
and the depression
that was around cities

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.520
like San Francisco and
certainly in Africa.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.050
It was ending the hopelessness.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.670
It's impossible to describe
how hopeless people felt.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.460
If you went to a village
in Africa, literally no one

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.680
talked about
education, or health,

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.790
or bringing up their kids.

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.930
They all thought they
were going to die.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.580
And it was a pretty
good bet, actually,

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.700
just 15 years ago--
just 15 years ago.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.980
15 years later, we can actually
see the end of these epidemics.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.810
In some ways, even more
exciting than that,

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.540
is what that would mean for us
as a human race and as people.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.740
So you know most infections
are pretty indiscriminate,

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.310
whether it's the absolute
hysteria about Zika, which

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.560
is totally unfounded
in anything scientific

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.940
or Ebola or influenza, if you
come into contact with it--

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.600
in fact, all of you probably
over the last couple of months

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.400
get sick fairly
regularly because you

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.860
come to work and
touch door knobs

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.321
and shake each other's hands.

00:04:18.321 --> 00:04:19.029
And you get sick.

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:20.904
And it doesn't matter
if you're rich or poor,

00:04:20.904 --> 00:04:23.230
or what color you are, or
if you're gay or straight.

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.770
If you come into contact
with an infectious disease

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.760
or an infectious element,
you have a pretty good chance

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.200
of getting infected.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.100
HIV and TB are very
different diseases.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.670
They're actually
diseases of the most

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.510
marginalized and
vulnerable in society.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.070
TB is fundamentally
today a disease

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.940
of the poor of the poorest
of the poor in inner cities,

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.480
living together in close
quarters with no access

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.470
to medical care.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.810
Or it's linked to
HIV because for those

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.480
of you who don't know, HIV
per se doesn't kill you.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.580
HIV destroys your immune system
so you die from other things.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.010
And actually TB is the
main thing people die from.

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.030
So TB and HIV are
very closely related.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.450
And the people who are
most at risk of HIV

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.460
are, again, the most vulnerable
marginalized in society.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.120
So it's the LGBTI
community, particularly gay

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.740
and transgender.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.380
And the numbers are frightening.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.470
I mean, if you go to
Latin America, Asia where

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.630
the epidemic is largely
controlled, 30%, 40% 50%

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.510
of trans and MSM
are HIV positive.

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.230
It's related to sex work.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.130
Sex workers are
very highly at risk,

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.800
people who inject
drugs, prisoners,

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.970
and migratory populations.

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.790
That's who is at risk
of tuberculosis and HIV.

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.050
So unlike most
infectious diseases

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.260
that are indiscriminate,
these diseases

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.240
are incredibly discriminatory.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.310
In fact, they prey
on discrimination.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.210
And they prey on the most
marginalized and vulnerable

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:57.950
who don't have
access to services,

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.440
who are left behind by society.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.410
And so to end the HIV and
tuberculosis epidemics,

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.110
we actually have to become
better people, which

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.610
is not actually the case with
most infectious diseases.

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.072
We have to create an
inclusive human family

00:06:12.072 --> 00:06:14.280
where everyone is welcomed,
where everyone has access

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.800
to health, where discrimination
and stigma no longer prevent

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.430
people from accessing
their basic human rights

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:22.990
and access to health care.

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:24.440
And that's pretty extraordinary.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.023
I mean, when you can end these
epidemics that have been around

00:06:27.023 --> 00:06:29.130
for millennia and
the modern plague,

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:30.820
but the only way
you can do it is

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:35.170
by creating a society we want
to have for the world, that's

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:36.020
really cool.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.550
And that's pretty
rare when you can

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.180
pull these two things together.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.971
And I think that's one
of the reasons we're

00:06:40.971 --> 00:06:47.120
so excited about the current
opportunity where we are today.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:52.200
And it's hugely exciting, but
it's also a little frightening

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.990
because the world's a pretty
scary place in some ways

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:56.000
right now.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.400
But it's also a world that's
filled with opportunity.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.190
I was just in
India, I mentioned.

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:07.450
I met with a group of
about 40 NGOs, mostly

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:12.720
sex work trans, MSM programs.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.230
They were crowded in a
room about this size.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.730
If we tried to have that
same meeting 15 years ago,

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.274
we basically would be meeting
in a closet with two people

00:07:22.274 --> 00:07:23.940
and whispering because
no one would have

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.510
wanted to know who we were.

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:27.700
And while they were
complaining, and appropriately,

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.310
that they don't have the
access that they want,

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.460
that there's still
discrimination, just the fact

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:34.040
that they were there
was extraordinary.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.310
You see the same thing in
Nigeria, and Haiti, Kenya,

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:40.700
no matter where I go, in Asia.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:44.470
When I first went to
China and Vietnam,

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.930
the part of the
Department of Health

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:49.350
that dealt with
the gay population,

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:51.880
the transgender population,
the people who inject drugs,

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:56.100
was known as the
Department of Social Evils.

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.470
Now it's part of the
Ministry of Health,

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:01.240
and I go to gay, MSM,
and trans programs

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.640
with the Minister of Health.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:04.920
It's really changed.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.210
It's changed tremendously.

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:08.090
And it's changing
in a stepwise kind

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:11.210
of genetic leap way, not
a slow progressive way,

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:13.471
but a genetic leap way.

00:08:13.471 --> 00:08:15.970
And I want to talk a little bit
about that genetic leap way,

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:18.120
and one of the groups we
don't talk enough about--

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.495
and it's astounding the number
of people who are actually

00:08:20.495 --> 00:08:22.410
involved in HIV,
including in Africa,

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:23.910
who don't understand those.

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:27.660
But the key affected population,
or the key population most

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:31.550
at risk for HIV today, is not
the traditional populations.

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:34.169
It's actually young
women, adolescent girls

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:35.460
and young women.

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:36.950
The rates are astronomical.

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:42.750
The rates are five times higher
than in boys, adolescent boys

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:44.570
and young men.

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:47.620
And it's largely driven
by transgenerational sex,

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.390
but it's largely
driven by the fact

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:51.770
that women aren't counted
as part of society.

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:54.810
Adolescent girls aren't counted
as an equal part of society.

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:59.240
And so gender-based
violence is rampant.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.940
Abuse is rampant.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.800
Somewhere in the neighborhood
of 40% to 60% of girls

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.670
will have their first
sexual encounter

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:11.630
through force or abuse in
parts of southern Africa.

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:15.235
When a girl is born,
she's not even registered.

00:09:15.235 --> 00:09:17.780
That's how little
they count in society.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.110
It's total gender
inequality that's

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:22.880
driving the HIV epidemic
in southern Africa.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:26.010
And so we actually can't
tackle and end the epidemic

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:28.272
unless we get a hold
of gender inequality,

00:09:28.272 --> 00:09:30.480
and that's one of the areas
that don't often come up,

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.855
particularly in
the United States

00:09:31.855 --> 00:09:34.590
where it was largely
a gay-driven epidemic,

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:37.670
still kind of is.

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:39.820
But when you get
outside, it actually

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:42.920
is very much-- and
southern Africa

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.950
is where the epidemic
is most out of control

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:50.170
or least in control, and it
is heavily, heavily driven

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:51.830
by gender inequality.

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:55.150
And so we can't end the epidemic
without not only dealing

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.880
with the traditional
populations that are left behind

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.860
but by a population that's half
the world that we don't even

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:03.650
often think of as a
vulnerable population,

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:06.460
but it's adolescent
girls and young women.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:08.260
And what's particularly
frightening is

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.480
because the birth
rate is so high,

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.830
the number of girls,
women and boys,

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:17.380
actually, who are
15 to 24, which

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:19.230
is the most at
risk group for HIV,

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:23.570
because it's the most sexually
active, is going to double.

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:26.190
That means that even if
we reduce the rate of HIV

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:30.780
by 50% in this population, we'll
still have a growing epidemic.

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:35.110
And we never reduce the rate
by 50% in a group like this.

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:38.080
So it's a really frightening
demographic picture,

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.510
and it really tells
us how important

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:43.460
dealing with fundamental
structural inequality issues

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:47.500
are for ending an
infectious disease.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.800
Now that youth bulge also
has a huge opportunity

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.030
because normally it takes
a generation or generations

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:57.820
to change issues of
human rights and equity.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:00.080
But when it's a lot of
young people, that's

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.370
going to be 60%
of the population,

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:03.870
you can actually
change much faster.

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:05.935
Because if that generation
changes their view,

00:11:05.935 --> 00:11:07.310
within 10 years,
they're actually

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:08.940
the majority of the population.

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:10.820
Rather than waiting
for slow change,

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:13.860
waiting for what the Romans
used to call "hope in death,"

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:16.790
waiting for people to die
off so things could change,

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:18.660
it can actually
change radically.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.290
And it can change
radically even where

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:22.484
you don't have that because
of the work you all do,

00:11:22.484 --> 00:11:24.650
because of the ability of
people to connect in a way

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:27.070
that we weren't able
to do not long ago.

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:29.610
And so social
movements can lead us

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:32.020
from where we were 10
years ago on gay rights

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:35.740
in this country to where
we are today, like that.

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:38.430
And that's something that's
a pretty remarkable thing

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:41.190
in social dynamics and pretty
remarkable thing lately.

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:44.850
Instead of going to multiple
generations of women fighting

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:48.060
for the right to
vote over 50 years,

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:50.970
you can change
things in five years.

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:56.150
And that's the huge opportunity
today to end these epidemics,

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:58.850
but to do it by becoming the
inclusive human family we want

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:03.610
to be, and by thinking about how
we use mechanisms that we use

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:06.060
to sell things to
talk to each other,

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:09.520
to connect to each other, to
actually change who we are

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.240
and change our society.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:14.050
And that type of innovation,
I'm sorry to say,

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:15.800
global public health
or public health

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.020
is not particularly good at.

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:20.120
In fact, we're awful at it.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:23.757
You'll still see billboards
for anti-HIV campaigns.

00:12:23.757 --> 00:12:25.840
I don't know the last time
someone actually looked

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.800
at a billboard.

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:32.330
We still do ads in papers
and just nonsense stuff.

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:36.140
No one's actually tapped
into the social-- they still

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:38.580
go to bars to pass out condoms.

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.530
People don't meet in
bars anymore for the most

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:43.220
part for sexual encounters.

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:45.400
There are other ways to do it.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.520
And no one's reached
into this world yet.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.390
No one has reached
into this world yet.

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:52.809
There are a couple of efforts
to kind of eek our way in.

00:12:52.809 --> 00:12:55.100
And then think not only about
how you would do it here,

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.370
but how would you
do it in Africa?

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:58.090
How would you reach
young people in Africa?

00:12:58.090 --> 00:12:59.620
Well, all of them
have cell phones.

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:01.230
All of them are online.

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:03.070
All of them are
talking to each other.

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:05.320
They're not listening to
their tribal leaders anymore.

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.653
They're connecting to the world.

00:13:06.653 --> 00:13:09.750
So how do we connect and
create a social movement

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:12.160
that will actually
drive these changes that

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.430
are essential for us
to end the epidemics?

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:16.422
But we can't do it without
changing who we are.

00:13:16.422 --> 00:13:17.380
And that's really cool.

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.671
That's fundamentally different
than, say, Ebola, right?

00:13:19.671 --> 00:13:22.180
You didn't need a social
movement to end Ebola.

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.530
You just needed to contain it.

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:26.030
To end these
epidemics, we actually

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:27.870
need social movement
and social change

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:31.614
and a radical shift
in human rights.

00:13:31.614 --> 00:13:33.780
And that's, I think, one
of the most exciting things

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:37.750
and why a lot of us get so
energized about the potential

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:39.270
because it's not
just an infection.

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:41.610
It's actually an
infection of society.

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:43.500
It's an infection of our values.

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.230
And there's a correction
to that infection.

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:48.275
And it's not going
to come from a pill.

00:13:48.275 --> 00:13:49.900
So it's great to be
here because you're

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:53.930
all the ones who can help us
figure out how to do all that.

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:55.469
I'd be happy to
talk about anything

00:13:55.469 --> 00:13:57.760
you want to talk about, but
thanks for taking your time

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.080
and thanks for interest
in these diseases.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.740
Because to be honest,
there's not a lot

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.050
of interest in them anymore.

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:04.550
We're losing that
pretty quickly.

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:07.690
And if you guys don't engage, if
your generation doesn't engage,

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:10.950
we will lose the opportunity
to end these epidemics.

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:14.060
And the next generation and the
next generation will still be

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:15.830
dealing with them
because we didn't.

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:19.690
So I hope you join us and
figure out how to do it.

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:22.040
So I'd be happy to
take any questions.

00:14:33.557 --> 00:14:34.890
AUDIENCE: Thanks for being here.

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:37.340
It's cool to see you.

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:38.837
Yeah, I just wondered--

00:14:38.837 --> 00:14:40.920
MARK DYBUL: Maybe your
name would be helpful, or--

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:41.670
AUDIENCE: Oh yeah.

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:45.480
My name is Christian,
software engineer.

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:51.130
Only by secondary interest,
I'm interested in these things.

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:54.750
So it's amazing
for me too that you

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:58.200
see this as a social problem
and can actually change society.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:01.090
Do you know, like especially
sub-Saharan Africa,

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:04.495
about some social experiments
that have been conducted,

00:15:04.495 --> 00:15:08.260
like that there's some countries
that have really succeeded

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.250
in doing this and some
experiments that have not

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:12.200
succeeded very well?

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.660
Like basically,
how do we solve it?

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:18.480
MARK DYBUL: We actually don't
have experiments per se.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.230
I mean, it's really hard.

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:23.870
We have a lot of
experiments on drugs.

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:25.150
We know which drugs to use.

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:27.490
We know how to use them.

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:29.977
But then we don't know how to
get people to actually take

00:15:29.977 --> 00:15:31.810
them every day, which
is a behavioral thing.

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:34.060
It's part of social
change too, right?

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:36.060
That's why we have these
massive drug resistance

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:38.300
profiles because people
aren't taking them.

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.770
But we do have behavioral
studies around adherence

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:43.040
and how to increase adherence.

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.810
So that we're getting
pretty good at it.

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:49.540
In terms of how you actually
change sexual behavior,

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:52.200
societal behavior,
we have nothing

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.916
in the way of good studies.

00:15:53.916 --> 00:15:56.290
And the reason is it's really
hard to control for things.

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:58.360
You can't really do
randomized control trials.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:01.050
You know, there are no good
randomized controlled trials

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:04.190
on how to stop smoking.

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:05.110
They moved past that.

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:08.770
The only thing that's ever
been proven to reduce smoking

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:11.930
is laws and taxes.

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:14.880
So there are actually no data
because it's really tough

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:19.500
to do the randomized controlled
trial on all the social change

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.350
that has happened
over the last 30 years

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:24.500
to basically stigmatize
smoking, all the campaigns.

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.070
None of that has
ever been proven

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:29.120
to make any difference
whatsoever because it's

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.650
impossible to do that study.

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:33.440
So that comes to the
art of public health,

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.900
using common sense, trying to
figure out what works and what

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:36.399
doesn't.

00:16:36.399 --> 00:16:39.500
And basically you throw as much
as you can at the wall and see

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.070
if it sticks.

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:44.012
So sadly, there are
almost no places

00:16:44.012 --> 00:16:46.220
where we've seen reductions
in, say, adolescent girls

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:47.217
and young women.

00:16:47.217 --> 00:16:48.550
And it's actually hard to study.

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:51.540
It's really hard
to study the rates.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.182
What we have found
recently-- and this

00:16:53.182 --> 00:16:54.640
is pretty exciting
to us because it

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.870
links education and health--
is that if you can keep girls

00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:02.070
in school, secondary
school, the rates of HIV

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:03.040
can drop dramatically.

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.456
Because if you're out of school,
your risk is really high.

00:17:05.456 --> 00:17:08.569
And the reason is you engage
in transactional sex for things

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:10.160
like cell phone, money.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.369
Families actually
tell their girls

00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:15.530
to go-- functionally they tell
their girls to go have sex

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:17.980
to bring some money home.

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:20.599
And so if we can keep
the girls in school,

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:24.230
what a study in Botswana showed
is for every year a girl stays

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:26.819
in secondary school,
the risk of HIV

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:30.330
drops by 12%, which
is pretty remarkable.

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:32.290
And over time, it
was actually 65%

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:34.870
in a study in Malawi for the
girls who stayed in school.

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:36.940
And the way we were able
to keep them in school

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:39.714
was by giving them a very
small cash incentive,

00:17:39.714 --> 00:17:41.130
and either giving
it to the family

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:42.950
so they didn't try
to sell her off

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:44.420
or giving it
directly to the girl

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:47.760
so she didn't have to sell
herself in a transactional way.

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:51.400
And often it's for cell phone
time or it's for school fees

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.476
so that they could go to
school or for a uniform

00:17:53.476 --> 00:17:54.600
so they could go to school.

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.530
So that's one insight.

00:17:56.530 --> 00:18:00.961
I'm going to Swaziland
tomorrow, Sunday.

00:18:00.961 --> 00:18:02.460
They're actually
launching a program

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:04.001
to do this because
they have a really

00:18:04.001 --> 00:18:06.090
high rate in adolescent
girls and young women.

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:07.720
And then we're also doing
gender-based violence programs.

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.660
But we don't have
really good studies.

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:11.270
So what we're doing
now is saying,

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:13.020
you know, we're all a
bunch of scientists.

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:14.990
We're never going to have a
randomized controlled trial

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:15.650
that proves this.

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:17.775
What we have to do is just
do a bunch of stuff that

00:18:17.775 --> 00:18:21.980
makes sense, that there's links
to, and then study the rates

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:24.540
and see what happens, and don't
worry about whether or not

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:27.100
we can say this or that
specific intervention did it.

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:28.690
Let's just do five
interventions that

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:31.650
seem to make sense and see
if the rates come down.

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:34.210
And that's what we're
starting to do now.

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:36.300
The US government
through PEPFAR,

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:38.310
we're supporting this program.

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:41.011
PEPFAR is something that's been
a great bipartisan program.

00:18:41.011 --> 00:18:43.260
It's really one of the things
the United States should

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.299
be most proud of, really,
largest international health

00:18:46.299 --> 00:18:48.090
initiative in history
for a single disease.

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:51.420
No one was putting any money
in global HIV before this.

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:53.490
Now the US is by far the leader.

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:55.440
They have a program that
we're very linked to.

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.237
We work really well in-country.

00:18:57.237 --> 00:18:58.320
But it's a great question.

00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.640
We don't know.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.140
And part of the
reason we don't know

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:04.940
is because we have too many
white male older doctors

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.009
and scientists
involved in all this

00:19:07.009 --> 00:19:09.550
who keep doing the same thing
over, and over, and over again.

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:11.700
We actually need people who'd
say, well, if you did this,

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:12.710
this would be a way
to reach people.

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:14.001
Or have you thought about that?

00:19:14.001 --> 00:19:15.890
Or can you do a game?

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:17.994
How would you link young people?

00:19:17.994 --> 00:19:19.660
How would you talk
with the young people

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:24.250
online to get them to
understand their risks

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:27.130
and even learn what
their risks are?

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:28.890
So that's what
we're trying to do,

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:33.210
get people interested in this,
which they really haven't been,

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:35.370
and move the scientists
off to the side.

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:36.480
We're great on the pills.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.990
We're going on the medicine.

00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:41.020
We're not so good
on social problems.

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:45.130
And so the bottom line
answer is we don't have

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:47.190
the data we would like to have.

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:51.280
We don't even know how to create
the data we would like to have.

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:54.945
So we'd love to have anyone
engaged who wants to be.

00:19:54.945 --> 00:19:56.320
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
it sounds like it

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:58.406
would be cool to get
psychologists involved--

00:19:58.406 --> 00:19:59.572
MARK DYBUL: Anthropologists.

00:19:59.572 --> 00:20:00.461
--in this problem.

00:20:00.461 --> 00:20:00.960
Yeah, yeah.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.876
MARK DYBUL: We actually
have, but they're also

00:20:02.876 --> 00:20:06.090
a bunch of doctors and older.

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:10.860
So, you know--

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:11.776
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:15.180
MARK DYBUL: There
are more and more,

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:20.180
but really, people are moving
away from these diseases.

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:23.900
Just at the moment, really
we're on the right side

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:27.090
of the tipping point right now.

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:29.930
We could get on the wrong
side really quickly.

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:31.847
Everyone talks about
a tipping point.

00:20:31.847 --> 00:20:33.930
Tipping points have two
places you can tip, right?

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:35.340
You can go in the
right direction

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:36.374
or the wrong direction.

00:20:36.374 --> 00:20:37.790
We're on the right
side of it now,

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:40.770
but we could easily
go the other way.

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:44.400
And we are losing the people
who used to be energized

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.305
and interested.

00:20:45.305 --> 00:20:46.930
And literally, here
are these meetings,

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:49.040
except if you're
in India, Africa,

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.860
and it's the same people who
were doing it 25 years ago.

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:55.270
So I don't know if
psychologists help.

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:57.852
I'd rather have social
media people, actually.

00:21:00.237 --> 00:21:01.070
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:21:07.375 --> 00:21:08.830
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Stephan.

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:11.460
I'd like to know what your plan
is for malaria, because it's

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:15.678
sort of not necessarily a
very social targeted disease.

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:20.900
MARK DYBUL: It's
a great question.

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.490
I mean, obviously you all
know you can eliminate malaria

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:25.490
because you don't have
to worry about it, right?

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:30.250
So you can actually
eliminate this infection.

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:31.830
And one of the
reasons I was in India

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:33.530
is India is actually
getting close.

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:35.779
They don't have malaria up
in the northeastern border,

00:21:35.779 --> 00:21:39.340
and they launched their
malaria elimination plan.

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:42.710
Malaria, unlike say
HIV and tuberculosis,

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:46.160
is purely a medical disease.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.020
It's mosquitoes.

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:48.670
It's not a social disease.

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:50.730
But it's social to
the extent that it's

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:54.260
linked to sanitation, and water,
and access to health care.

00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:01.160
That's why TB is all over.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.670
And it's in India and China.

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:05.069
HIV is heavily in Africa,
and it's heavily in others.

00:22:05.069 --> 00:22:06.860
There's probably some
medical reasons to it

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:08.240
we just don't understand.

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:11.910
But malaria is one
that we can eradicate.

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:15.667
The complexity is sticking with
it long enough to eradicate.

00:22:15.667 --> 00:22:17.500
So what we've often
done, and actually we've

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:18.140
done this before.

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:20.120
There was a malaria
elimination effort in the '60s.

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:21.970
It did pretty well,
but we didn't carry it

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:23.650
all the way through.

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:28.230
Unless you really eliminate
and eradicate, it comes back.

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:30.580
And it comes back
really quickly.

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:33.690
When the Minister of
Health of Zanzibar, which

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:36.344
is an island, and I was told
that the president's malaria

00:22:36.344 --> 00:22:38.510
initiative was going to
support them to end malaria,

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:40.486
he literally said,
oh, that's great.

00:22:40.486 --> 00:22:41.360
We know how to do it.

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:42.950
We've done it three times.

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:45.570
And they actually had.

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:46.970
But mosquitoes keep coming back.

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:47.956
They come on a ship.

00:22:47.956 --> 00:22:48.830
They come on a plane.

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:50.787
They keep coming back.

00:22:50.787 --> 00:22:52.870
So what you have to do is
have a really smart plan

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:55.734
that pushes to elimination,
but it has a regional approach.

00:22:55.734 --> 00:22:57.150
And that's always
been complicated

00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:02.810
because mosquitoes don't
follow geopolitical borders.

00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:04.780
And so they fly
all over the place.

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:09.090
And we actually know how
far they can fly now.

00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:10.850
And we're being
much more strategic

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:12.540
about cross-border stuff.

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:17.035
But to some extent, it's the
same thing with HIV and TB.

00:23:17.035 --> 00:23:19.040
And it's actually
happened with smallpox.

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:21.930
If any of you care about
this, read Bill Foege's book,

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:23.080
"House on Fire."

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.040
It's 100 pages.

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.910
It's a really cool book.

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:27.675
And it's about how
smallpox ended.

00:23:27.675 --> 00:23:30.050
And only a fraction of
it is about science.

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:33.510
It's actually mostly about how
you change people's mindset.

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:35.010
And the biggest
mindset change was

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:37.689
moving towards trying to
control it, to end it.

00:23:37.689 --> 00:23:39.480
Because what you try
to do when you control

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.688
an infection like malaria
is very different than when

00:23:41.688 --> 00:23:42.865
you try to eliminate it.

00:23:42.865 --> 00:23:44.990
So we're really trying to
shift everyone's thinking

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:46.580
from it's not control.

00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:47.890
It's not reducing the rate.

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:50.000
It's actually eliminating
and sticking with it

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.394
until you eliminate.

00:23:51.394 --> 00:23:52.310
So we're very excited.

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:54.260
And then in the last,
literally, two years, there's

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:55.650
been a big shift--
and Bill Gates

00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:59.020
has had a big role in
this-- towards shifting

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:02.790
our mindset to eliminating
and moving region by region.

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:05.010
So there's now a
plan that we think

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:09.730
35 to 45 countries can get
to elimination by 2020, 2025.

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:11.200
And then you move the next step.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:14.760
And then you have to
maintain the control rates

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:18.310
so that you maintain
the elimination

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:19.490
and it doesn't bounce back.

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:21.230
And then you just keep pushing.

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:25.780
So we actually now think by
2030 we can eliminate malaria

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:26.919
from the planet.

00:24:26.919 --> 00:24:28.460
I actually think,
and Bill things, we

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:31.410
can probably do it by
2025 if we really focus on

00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:32.575
a little more innovation.

00:24:32.575 --> 00:24:35.200
But then the trick's going to be
sticking with another 10 to 15

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.060
years so it doesn't come back.

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:39.190
You know, with all the
Zika madness around,

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:41.773
it's the same thing.

00:24:41.773 --> 00:24:44.162
Or Dengue-- it's
the same mosquitoes.

00:24:44.162 --> 00:24:48.260
So vector control, controlling
mosquito-borne diseases,

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:49.690
actually is more than malaria.

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:51.717
It actually would do the
same thing for Dengue.

00:24:51.717 --> 00:24:53.800
It would do the same thing
for Zika, which doesn't

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:54.970
kill anyone, by the way.

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:58.430
I mean, it's really
just insanity,

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:00.162
the hysteria around Zika.

00:25:00.162 --> 00:25:02.672
I actually had someone who
works in our office in Geneva,

00:25:02.672 --> 00:25:04.130
in a global health
office, asked me

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:07.090
if it was safe to travel to the
United States because of Zika.

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:09.300
I mean, that's how
crazy it's gotten.

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:12.350
But it's an entry point into
how you do vector control.

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:15.160
There's also a new movement
to eradicate mosquitoes,

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:17.190
which is probably
going a little far,

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:20.350
and I'm not sure we can do it.

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:23.035
But there actually is
an elimination plan,

00:25:23.035 --> 00:25:26.560
and elimination strategy,
and elimination mindset now.

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:27.920
I think we'll get there.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.320
I actually think
we'll get there.

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:30.836
That's the easiest of the three.

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:46.010
AUDIENCE: You've used the
word "innovation" a few times

00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:47.920
and pointed out
you don't actually

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:51.300
know exactly what the steps are
to eliminate these diseases.

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:52.800
Maybe you could
tell us a little bit

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:56.300
about how the Global
Fund works and maybe

00:25:56.300 --> 00:26:00.710
with an eye towards how
that supports or attracts

00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:03.390
innovation.

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:05.980
MARK DYBUL: So we're actually
a pretty unique institution.

00:26:08.397 --> 00:26:10.730
I'll digress a little bit
because it's Friday afternoon.

00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:11.640
I'm tired.

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:14.180
So 15 years ago,
if you asked anyone

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:17.890
what are we doing in
the world to fight AIDS,

00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:23.792
malnutrition, better
agriculture, anything

00:26:23.792 --> 00:26:24.750
in development, really.

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:27.362
The answer would have been we're
spending X amount of money.

00:26:27.362 --> 00:26:28.820
I mean, literally,
you can go back.

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:29.653
That was the answer.

00:26:29.653 --> 00:26:33.210
We're spending X. There was
no link to what are you doing

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:36.647
with the money, how's it going.

00:26:36.647 --> 00:26:38.230
It really was just
how much you spend.

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:39.479
And there's a reason for that.

00:26:39.479 --> 00:26:44.480
I mean, development was not
born of the most noble origins.

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:47.610
It was a colonial
thing to start with,

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:49.440
then missionary
related to colonial,

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:52.160
then Cold War related.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.010
And so really the
reason the answer

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:56.480
was how much do you spend
is a lot of development

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:58.900
was making yourself feel
better, so you were giving money

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:01.441
to poor people because you did
some really bad things to them

00:27:01.441 --> 00:27:04.980
historically or
making them like you.

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:06.650
So you're trying to
like yourself better

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:09.030
or you were making them like
you by giving them money.

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:11.238
You didn't care what they
did with it as long as they

00:27:11.238 --> 00:27:13.560
liked you in the Cold War.

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:15.550
That's not why people
did development,

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:18.300
but that's where the money
came for development.

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:19.894
So there's a reason
for that answer.

00:27:19.894 --> 00:27:22.060
Then people started to
realize, well, actually we're

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:23.540
giving a lot of
our tax money away.

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:25.856
And, you know, the Cold
War is almost over,

00:27:25.856 --> 00:27:27.480
and we shouldn't be
doing that anymore.

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:29.896
And then it shifted to, what
are you doing with the money?

00:27:29.896 --> 00:27:31.116
How are we achieving results?

00:27:31.116 --> 00:27:32.490
How are we partnering
with people

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:34.114
rather than treating
them like children

00:27:34.114 --> 00:27:36.990
and patting them on the head
by giving them some money?

00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:40.062
And that change happened
around 2000, actually.

00:27:40.062 --> 00:27:41.520
And then there was
something called

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:44.546
the Millennium Development Goals
that were born out of that.

00:27:44.546 --> 00:27:46.420
And we, the Global
Fund, was actually

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:50.110
created out of that
radically new-- I mean,

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:55.090
really a genetic shift from
a hundred years, literally,

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:57.985
of thinking in development to,
how do you partner with people?

00:27:57.985 --> 00:27:59.360
How do you bring
people together?

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.901
How do you support the countries
to achieve their objectives,

00:28:01.901 --> 00:28:04.140
not my objective
in their country?

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:06.860
How do we recognize that it's
not us with all the ideas

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:09.430
that are coming to show
these poor people what

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:13.800
to do but supporting them
to be create the ideas that

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:14.910
will solve the problems?

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:16.620
So we were created that way.

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:18.560
So we don't have any
country presence,

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:21.980
unlike almost pretty much
any development organization.

00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:25.220
We're a financial
mechanism that brings

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:28.210
people with the resources
together with the countries

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:30.240
that are implementing,
including civil society,

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:31.630
the private sector, all around.

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:35.090
And the idea was that we would
use resources to then support

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:37.930
countries to achieve their
objectives that they would

00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:41.030
lead and run and innovate.

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:43.675
So a lot of the innovation
that we talk about-- now,

00:28:43.675 --> 00:28:45.520
there's scientific innovation.

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:47.650
In India, people
were using tablets.

00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:49.940
And literally, community
health care workers

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:52.170
were carrying around
backpacks filled with files.

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:55.120
Now they carry around a
tablet that pushes data

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.710
to a centralized source, and
they're actually improving

00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:59.570
their efficiency dramatically.

00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:02.540
That was pretty cool
technological advances.

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:04.380
There's technological
advance with drugs.

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:06.970
There are mosquito bed nets that
now have insecticide in them

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:08.280
so they kill the mosquitoes.

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:10.940
You don't just keep the
mosquito from biting you.

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:12.550
There's actually
genetic modification

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:16.180
of mosquitoes that can actually
have a swarm effect that

00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:19.120
can't transmit malaria.

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:21.602
And they're genetically
modified so that they dominate

00:29:21.602 --> 00:29:23.310
so that you could
actually introduce them

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:25.660
into a population and get
rid of the malaria-carrying

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:26.540
mosquitoes.

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:29.254
That's really cool
scientific innovation.

00:29:29.254 --> 00:29:31.170
But then there's the
innovation on the ground.

00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:32.990
Like, how do you keep
a person coming back

00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:37.010
to take their antiretroviral
therapy or their TB therapy?

00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:39.420
And those innovations
are the communities

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:41.140
on the ground figuring it out.

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:42.900
How to keep girls
in school, those

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:44.370
are the communities
on the ground.

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:46.453
We've actually gone in and
looked at some of this.

00:29:46.453 --> 00:29:48.090
And it's amazing
what they come up

00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:50.630
with and the solutions
that they find.

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:52.670
So we were designed,
basically, to provide

00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:55.770
the resources to
stimulate that innovation

00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:58.510
from a national level down
to the individual health care

00:29:58.510 --> 00:29:59.460
worker.

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:01.805
Hasn't always worked
the way we wanted it to.

00:30:01.805 --> 00:30:03.430
We're trying to do
more and more of it.

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:05.340
We have actually created
an innovation hub

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:07.570
to bring the best ideas
together, to stimulate them,

00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:09.970
to catalyze the change,
to be a little more

00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:12.850
proactive in bringing the
lessons learned around

00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:14.650
as we learn them.

00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:16.870
But also to be
comfortable with--

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:19.610
and this is something health
people, medical people,

00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:23.360
have always had difficulty, be
comfortable with not knowing.

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:26.100
Be comfortable with
playing a little bit.

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:29.000
Be comfortable
familiar with failure,

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.400
to let this innovation bloom.

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.650
And that's what we're getting
more and more and better

00:30:33.650 --> 00:30:34.700
and better at.

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:37.780
It's really cool the
shift in how we've

00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:39.060
thought about development.

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:40.290
The mindset hasn't changed.

00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:43.880
I still hear people talk
about, oh, those poor Africans.

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:45.851
We're coming to help.

00:30:45.851 --> 00:30:47.350
They're actually
doing all the work.

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:48.850
We're just providing
them with support.

00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:50.040
And it's really remarkable.

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:52.920
I've had the privilege to go
to the same communities 15

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.940
years apart and to
see the difference

00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:58.740
from the hopelessness,
the total despair

00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:01.140
to these incredibly bright
people who have come up

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:03.700
with the best solutions that
are solving their own problems--

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:07.100
to empower them, including
with the technological tools

00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:09.160
like a tablet, but
to empower them

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.620
to then solve their problems.

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:12.703
And that's what the Global
Fund was created to do.

00:31:12.703 --> 00:31:15.700
So we collect money, and
then we disperse money.

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:18.350
We disperse about
$4 billion a year,

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:21.050
collect and disperse about $4
billion a year, which makes us

00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:23.810
the largest multilateral
funder of the global health

00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:27.710
of any kind for HIV,
TB, and malaria.

00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:30.110
The US government has
a bigger HIV program.

00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:33.025
We have a bigger malaria
program and a bigger TB program.

00:31:36.634 --> 00:31:38.050
This is pretty
exciting, actually.

00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:41.830
The countries now are
spending as much or more

00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:44.380
of their own money to
combat HIV, TB, and malaria

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:45.610
as coming from the outside.

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:46.820
There's still this
perception all the money

00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:48.040
is coming from outside.

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:51.930
They're actually paying 50%
of their HIV, about 52%,

00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:55.870
48% of their malaria,
and about 80% of TB.

00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:59.050
Because 70% of the
TB in the world

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:00.450
is in the BRICS countries.

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:02.942
So they're the ones
mostly paying for it.

00:32:02.942 --> 00:32:04.900
So what we do in those
environments is actually

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:07.810
try to catalyze
change, innovation,

00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:09.440
bring innovation,
share innovation,

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:11.148
but not in the sense
of I have an answer.

00:32:11.148 --> 00:32:12.150
You have to take it.

00:32:12.150 --> 00:32:15.510
More in the sense of, how
do we solve a problem?

00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:17.490
And that's what the
fund was created to do.

00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:19.710
So it's actually
a pretty neat job.

00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:22.595
We're a Swiss
foundation, but we're

00:32:22.595 --> 00:32:25.450
a multilateral organization
that functions like the UN,

00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:26.630
but we're not the UN.

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.107
You're back.

00:32:30.107 --> 00:32:30.690
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:30.690 --> 00:32:31.320
Christian.

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:32.010
Hi again.

00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:33.930
So I wonder a little
bit about tuberculosis,

00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:35.845
like more technical.

00:32:35.845 --> 00:32:40.120
As I understand, like
tuberculosis, your researchers

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:42.590
don't really know how it works?

00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:43.780
And is there a treatment?

00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:46.770
Like, if I get it
tomorrow, is there

00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:48.610
a medicine to take for me?

00:32:48.610 --> 00:32:52.960
And how expensive is it to
actually technically take

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:55.049
a pill and be good?

00:32:55.049 --> 00:32:56.840
MARK DYBUL: So the fact
that you don't know

00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:00.245
is actually pretty cool because
it means-- which is true.

00:33:00.245 --> 00:33:02.370
Most people don't have to
worry about tuberculosis.

00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:05.970
So they only tuberculosis
in Switzerland or the United

00:33:05.970 --> 00:33:09.000
States, or actually almost
all of Western Europe,

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.890
is TB-- same for malaria--
that gets imported.

00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:13.340
Someone goes someplace.

00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:14.230
They get coughed on.

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:15.092
They get TB.

00:33:15.092 --> 00:33:17.050
Or they go someplace and
get bit by a mosquito,

00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:18.160
and they come back.

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:19.670
That's the only case.

00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:22.250
It's imported, which means
you can eliminate it, right?

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:24.640
Because it's been eliminated
in a lot of places.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:30.280
So TB is in some ways the
most frustrating to me

00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:33.670
because we have
curative therapy.

00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:38.310
It takes six months to cure
tuberculosis, six months.

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:40.010
HIV is life-long therapy.

00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:42.550
could you imagine if
we had curative therapy

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:44.660
in six months for HIV?

00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:47.210
I mean, we have the activism.

00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:48.570
We have the galvanism.

00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:50.860
HIV would be gone.

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:53.261
The rate of decline of
TB, despite the fact

00:33:53.261 --> 00:33:55.010
that we have a six
month curative therapy,

00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:57.130
is 1.5% per year.

00:33:57.130 --> 00:33:58.730
It's pathetic.

00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:03.110
You know, by that rate, it
will take 200 years to end TB.

00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:06.680
And what's even worse
is while we have a 1.5%

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:10.687
decline in new infections
per year-- wow-- because

00:34:10.687 --> 00:34:12.520
of the growth in the
population, we actually

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:15.130
have more people with TB even
though the rate is slightly

00:34:15.130 --> 00:34:16.120
going down.

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:19.070
So it's enormously frustrating.

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:21.760
One of the biggest problems
is no one cares about it

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:24.060
because it's mostly poor
people in inner cities

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:25.989
that governments don't
spend a lot of time on.

00:34:25.989 --> 00:34:27.947
There are people who
don't understand that they

00:34:27.947 --> 00:34:29.080
have access to health care.

00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:31.949
And they literally will be
coughing themselves to death

00:34:31.949 --> 00:34:34.820
before they go to a hospital
or before they go to a clinic.

00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:36.945
And by the time they've
done that, they've infected

00:34:36.945 --> 00:34:39.199
a whole bunch of other people.

00:34:39.199 --> 00:34:41.250
And then the programs
aren't particularly good.

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:43.850
And what's equally
problematic right now

00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:48.280
is the public sector-- so India
has 25% of the TB in the world.

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:51.420
You put India and China
together, you're almost 45%.

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:53.510
Again, the BRICS are 70%.

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:55.250
Development agencies
aren't going

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:58.800
to be doing a lot of
stuff in BRICS countries.

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:01.530
And in southern Africa,
it's largely linked to HIV,

00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:02.590
as I mentioned.

00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:06.360
And interestingly, a lot of it
is related to migratory miners.

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:10.550
It's not their fault. They
do one mine in Mozambique.

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:11.910
That season ends.

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:15.050
And then they go to their home
family in another country.

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:16.960
And they were on their
TB drugs in the mines,

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.960
because they actually
test you because you're

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.430
in a confined area.

00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:23.190
It's not good to have
TB people in your mines.

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:25.030
But when they leave,
they stop their drugs.

00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:26.800
And then they go home and cough.

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.550
And they cough on their family.

00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:30.591
And then everyone in the
community-- and the data

00:35:30.591 --> 00:35:31.960
tell us this-- get infected.

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.335
And then they go to a new
mine, and they start a new drug

00:35:34.335 --> 00:35:36.030
regimen, which is
different than the one

00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:38.280
they took before because
the countries aren't aligned

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:40.150
in the regimens that you take.

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:42.020
And then they go
to a new family--

00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:44.520
because often they have more
than one family because they're

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.250
migratory workers--
in another country,

00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:47.380
start the process again.

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:48.588
And it keeps going and going.

00:35:48.588 --> 00:35:51.520
So about a third of all
new TB in southern Africa

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:54.370
is from migratory
miners, a third of it.

00:35:54.370 --> 00:35:57.890
And because it crosses borders,
we've not followed it at all.

00:35:57.890 --> 00:35:59.230
We're just starting to do that.

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:01.620
So this is not a
technical problem.

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:04.960
This is actually just a public
health approach problem.

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:09.050
And it's a willingness to
reach people who are migrating,

00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:11.220
people who are poor
in inner cities.

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:13.910
This is not a technical problem.

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:15.600
This is a social problem.

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:18.000
The only technical
problem is diagnosis,

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.440
which isn't particularly easy.

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:23.360
Hopefully we'll have
a new urine test.

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:26.670
And increasingly, we
think of TB in the lungs.

00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:28.050
TB actually can be anywhere.

00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:33.100
TB actually used to be known
as the inscrutable disease.

00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:34.980
Anything could be TB.

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:38.250
And there's more and more
TB that's not in the lungs,

00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:39.930
and that's even
harder to diagnose.

00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:41.330
So the diagnosis
part is actually

00:36:41.330 --> 00:36:43.070
the technically difficult thing.

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:45.210
But once you've diagnosed
and identified someone,

00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:46.585
if you take your
drugs every day,

00:36:46.585 --> 00:36:49.680
you're cured in six months.

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:52.222
AUDIENCE: Why do they
stop taking the drug?

00:36:52.222 --> 00:36:54.680
Is it the educational problem,
that they don't know that--?

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:58.227
MARK DYBUL: When's the last time
you took, say, an antibiotic?

00:36:58.227 --> 00:37:00.810
When's the last time you took a
drug that required you to take

00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:03.112
it for 10 days, 15 days.

00:37:03.112 --> 00:37:04.986
AUDIENCE: That was a
while ago, but I did it.

00:37:04.986 --> 00:37:05.412
MARK DYBUL: Did you?

00:37:05.412 --> 00:37:05.912
Yeah.

00:37:05.912 --> 00:37:08.345
So one of my
favorite studies-- I

00:37:08.345 --> 00:37:09.970
used to be an infectious
disease doctor

00:37:09.970 --> 00:37:11.460
before I became a bureaucrat.

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:15.550
And one of my favorite studies
was among infectious disease

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:20.730
doctors who were given a
14-day course of antibiotics

00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:22.095
because they had an infection.

00:37:22.095 --> 00:37:25.180
About 30% finished it.

00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:28.790
These are infectious
disease doctors, right?

00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:31.510
So the natural
course for anything

00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:34.930
is, and I bet most of you have
done this, you start taking it.

00:37:34.930 --> 00:37:38.450
As soon as you feel
better, you stop taking it.

00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:40.270
And taking drugs every
day for six months

00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:42.376
isn't particularly fun,
and it's not even easy.

00:37:42.376 --> 00:37:43.900
And six months is a
relatively long time.

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:46.275
So we started something called
Directly Observed Therapy,

00:37:46.275 --> 00:37:49.440
which actually works, but it got
misused because public health

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:50.690
bureaucrats got a hold of it.

00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:53.190
And we created a bureaucracy
rather than listening to people

00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:54.530
and understanding how to do it.

00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:57.900
And then think about HIV,
which is lifelong therapy.

00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:01.560
And the other thing about
especially HIV drugs

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:03.460
is every time you take
a pill it reminds you

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:04.919
that you have something.

00:38:04.919 --> 00:38:06.460
Most people don't
want to be reminded

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:07.626
that they have an infection.

00:38:07.626 --> 00:38:10.830
They'd rather think
they're healthy.

00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:13.820
So it's normal--
was it you who said

00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:16.130
we should get psychologists?

00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:17.640
It's normal human behavior.

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:19.630
And if infectious disease
doctors can't even

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:22.170
finish a 14-day
course of antibiotics,

00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:23.820
just imagine how
complicated this is?

00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:25.820
AUDIENCE: Can't we do
something like [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:26.720
that you operate in?

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:27.690
I mean, there are
like preventive--

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:28.380
MARK DYBUL: Yeah.

00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:28.720
AUDIENCE: So yeah--

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:29.928
MARK DYBUL: Yeah, no, no, no.

00:38:29.928 --> 00:38:31.950
We're getting more
and more to that.

00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:36.920
So we don't have them
yet for tuberculosis.

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:38.920
But people are worried--
and part of the problem

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:42.220
is there is no market
for tuberculosis drugs.

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:45.080
Tuberculosis is for poor
people in poor countries.

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:48.050
So why would a company invest
in an innovative tuberculosis

00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:50.584
product that they're never
going to make any money on?

00:38:50.584 --> 00:38:52.000
HIV is different
because there are

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.600
enough people in Western markets
that they can make money on.

00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:55.780
Malaria is the same thing.

00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:57.240
AUDIENCE: But you have money.

00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:59.110
MARK DYBUL: No, we
don't do research.

00:38:59.110 --> 00:39:02.310
The Gates Foundation and
the US National Institute

00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:04.600
and other national
institutions have actually

00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:05.750
created partnerships.

00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:09.010
What we can do is say
they'll be a market.

00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:11.820
So if you produce
that, we'll buy it.

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:14.220
You will make a huge
profit, but really,

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:16.440
if you're a drug company
executive and you can make

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:19.230
Viagra or you can make an
anti-tuberculosis drug,

00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:20.730
which one do you
think your board is

00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:22.640
going to want you to make?

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:26.650
So you have to actually
stimulate these low profit

00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:27.690
margin investments.

00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:29.820
And we've gotten
much better at that.

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:32.492
And we do have a role
as a bulk procurer,

00:39:32.492 --> 00:39:33.950
but there's not a
lot of incentive.

00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:35.950
But there is really cool stuff.

00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:40.630
So there are now two
injectable HIV products

00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:44.015
that last, we hope, three months
that are being put together.

00:39:44.015 --> 00:39:45.890
We're not sure if they'll
work for treatment,

00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:48.074
but they'll work for
prevention for sure.

00:39:48.074 --> 00:39:49.740
For those of you who
don't know, there's

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:51.780
also something called
depo provera, which

00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:55.890
is an injectable family planning
product that we're working

00:39:55.890 --> 00:39:57.620
to put in with the HIV drugs.

00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:01.080
So imagine, we could actually
have a drug-- one injection

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:04.270
every three months that prevents
HIV and is a family planning

00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:05.040
tool.

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:09.400
There actually is a
long-lasting subcutaneous family

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:11.170
planning device too.

00:40:11.170 --> 00:40:12.550
The problem is volume.

00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:13.660
There's the biochemistry.

00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:16.830
It's the volume, and
it's the reaction,

00:40:16.830 --> 00:40:18.030
but we're getting there.

00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:19.530
But there hasn't
been the incentive.

00:40:19.530 --> 00:40:20.932
It's not actually the science.

00:40:20.932 --> 00:40:22.140
We could probably figure out.

00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:23.134
It's the incentive.

00:40:23.134 --> 00:40:25.550
And this is where the Gates
Foundation and a lot of others

00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:28.682
are investing to create
those technologies.

00:40:28.682 --> 00:40:29.390
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:35.650
AUDIENCE: I'm interested in how
the problems you're addressing

00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:36.720
are related to poverty.

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:38.800
You mentioned several
times how that's entwined,

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:42.110
I guess, in different ways.

00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:44.220
How closely linked
do you see that is?

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:46.480
And do you do work with
anti-poverty organizations

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:47.854
as part of what you're doing?

00:40:47.854 --> 00:40:49.270
MARK DYBUL: It's
a great question,

00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:55.450
and it really gets to-- TB
is a disease of poverty.

00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:59.060
Malaria is in a lot
of ways a disease

00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:01.580
of poverty because it
relates to sanitation,

00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:06.569
and water, and access,
having a living condition.

00:41:06.569 --> 00:41:09.110
But we can't do everything, and
the expertise that's required

00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:10.470
is completely different.

00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:14.900
And so we don't actually
invest in anti-poverty efforts.

00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:17.810
We work with organizations that
do like the World Bank, the UN

00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:20.820
Development Project, and
others, and fundamentally

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:23.500
with the countries,
because economic growth,

00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:27.610
as long as it's equitable,
actually can be great in terms

00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:30.280
of lifting out of these things.

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:33.400
HIV, as you probably well
know, is not a disease

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:35.644
of the poorest of the poor.

00:41:35.644 --> 00:41:37.810
It's actually a disease of
the slightly more mobile,

00:41:37.810 --> 00:41:42.590
including in Africa, and
those vulnerable populations.

00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:45.279
So we link with them.

00:41:45.279 --> 00:41:46.820
This has been one
of the myths that's

00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:48.444
been annoying a lot
of people is, well,

00:41:48.444 --> 00:41:52.830
just have economic growth, and
that'll solve all our disease

00:41:52.830 --> 00:41:53.330
problems.

00:41:53.330 --> 00:41:55.140
Well, that's only
true if you equitably

00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:56.270
distribute the resources.

00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:59.285
And we're becoming a more
and more unequal world.

00:41:59.285 --> 00:42:01.660
We're actually involved in
something called the Equitable

00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:03.540
Access Initiative, which
I'm not going to get into,

00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:05.081
which is pretty
cool, which is trying

00:42:05.081 --> 00:42:08.320
to address some of these
issues through a health lens.

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:10.060
But it's a really
good point, and it

00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:12.430
gets to how can you
stay within your mandate

00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:13.730
and still have an impact?

00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:19.050
So we try to link with and
then support countries to have

00:42:19.050 --> 00:42:21.620
the fiscal space so
that they can actually

00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:23.510
combat these infections
at the same time

00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:24.884
that their economies
are growing.

00:42:27.549 --> 00:42:29.840
AUDIENCE: So I'm about to
raise a subject that is bound

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:31.089
to be a little bit contagious.

00:42:31.089 --> 00:42:35.260
But one of the
measures that's been

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:38.440
taken against mosquito-borne
diseases such as malaria

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:41.060
are insecticides.

00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:46.220
Now, DDT is, of course,
far from a good substance,

00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:51.650
and it was banned in I think
the late '80s, around the time.

00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:54.555
And the developmental
age was also

00:42:54.555 --> 00:42:58.030
made dependent on
banning the use of DDT.

00:42:58.030 --> 00:43:01.380
Now, of course,
I'm not a chemist.

00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:05.830
I'm not aware of exactly
how justified [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:05.830 --> 00:43:07.490
was, but by some
accounts, actually

00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:11.450
banning this substance has
cost up to a couple of million

00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:13.416
or tens of millions
of innocent lives.

00:43:13.416 --> 00:43:15.040
Now, so I've got two
questions for you.

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:17.460
How justified was this scare?

00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:22.480
And is there research into other
insecticides that may actually

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:27.730
be just as effective as DDT
but less damaging to our lives?

00:43:27.730 --> 00:43:29.220
MARK DYBUL: Yes.

00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:31.350
And this is still,
unfortunately, a debate,

00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:33.770
but it has changed
a lot since then.

00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:36.520
So WHO has certified
DDT as safe.

00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:39.960
We buy a lot of DDT, and
countries use a lot of DDT.

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:42.310
Some countries still
don't because they still

00:43:42.310 --> 00:43:47.550
remember these things, but DDT
is now a valid insecticide,

00:43:47.550 --> 00:43:51.700
and we support countries
to buy a lot of it.

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:52.692
There are side effects.

00:43:52.692 --> 00:43:54.150
There's side effects
to everything.

00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:57.920
But used smartly
and the side effects

00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:01.530
that we used to see we
don't see so much anymore.

00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:05.280
There are second and third
generation insecticides that

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:08.910
are as if not more effective.

00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:11.600
The problem with all of them
is resistance over time,

00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:13.170
and we're already
starting to see--

00:44:13.170 --> 00:44:14.460
so there's DDT resistance.

00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:15.870
And we use this other one.

00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:18.330
But interestingly,
then the mosquitoes

00:44:18.330 --> 00:44:22.070
that were resistant to
DDT die because they

00:44:22.070 --> 00:44:24.919
got sprayed with the new one,
and then DDT sensitive again.

00:44:24.919 --> 00:44:26.710
So we actually have to
measure periodically

00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:28.860
and you rotate insecticides.

00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:30.569
And then there's
a new generation

00:44:30.569 --> 00:44:32.610
because we're actually
starting to see resistance

00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:34.650
to all of the insecticides.

00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:37.510
And we also then put
insecticides in the bed nets

00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:40.652
so it's not just the spray.

00:44:40.652 --> 00:44:41.940
Because it's pretty cool.

00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:43.120
You kill the mosquito.

00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:45.430
You don't just prevent
it from biting you.

00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:46.440
And that has an impact.

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:49.330
So what we saw early on is
with insecticide treated nets,

00:44:49.330 --> 00:44:51.760
if you put nets in a village,
the next village actually

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:53.440
had a reduction in
its malaria rate

00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:56.100
because the
mosquitoes were dying.

00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:58.160
But because we use
the same insecticide,

00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:01.850
we then started amplifying
the insecticide resistance

00:45:01.850 --> 00:45:03.970
with the bed nets
and the sprays.

00:45:03.970 --> 00:45:05.760
So we do cycle now.

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:09.660
The third generation is great,
but it's very expensive.

00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:13.060
It's about three times as
expensive as the other two.

00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:15.301
And so we're playing
both to reduce the cost

00:45:15.301 --> 00:45:17.550
but also in how we rotate
in an intelligent way, which

00:45:17.550 --> 00:45:19.130
gets back to elimination.

00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:21.340
You actually do need
spraying for elimination.

00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:24.710
There is no silver
bullet for anything.

00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:25.800
So you have to treat.

00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:26.650
You have to spray.

00:45:26.650 --> 00:45:27.830
You have these bed nets.

00:45:27.830 --> 00:45:29.000
You have to put it
all together, and you

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.750
have to do it in a
public health approach.

00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:34.274
But for the most part,
we're past the DDT issue.

00:45:34.274 --> 00:45:35.940
There are still some
countries and still

00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:37.648
some people who
periodically [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:37.648 --> 00:45:40.850
But it's certified by WHO,
and most countries now

00:45:40.850 --> 00:45:41.900
are comfortable using it.

00:45:46.759 --> 00:45:47.800
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Daniel.

00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:50.590
I'm an attorney with some
interest in public health

00:45:50.590 --> 00:45:51.670
law and ethics.

00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:55.560
You mentioned the interests
of pharmaceutical companies

00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:56.440
before.

00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:59.310
I just want to ask how
intellectual property

00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:03.450
rights, especially patent laws,
factor into that whole debate.

00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:05.950
I know I haven't
followed that entirely,

00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:08.530
but there's something
like a Doha declaration

00:46:08.530 --> 00:46:12.690
that enables the poorer
countries, the WTO member

00:46:12.690 --> 00:46:16.410
states, to issue
compulsory licenses.

00:46:16.410 --> 00:46:19.150
But that doesn't work
in all instances,

00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:21.360
especially not if
those countries don't

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:25.300
have the facilities to actually
manufacture these drugs.

00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:28.910
Can you go a little
bit into that?

00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:32.190
MARK DYBUL: So it's a
really important area,

00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:37.410
and actually the availability
of generic products

00:46:37.410 --> 00:46:40.180
is one of the factors in
the remarkable reduction

00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:42.150
on the price of all
of the products.

00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:48.030
So antiretrovirals when we
were putting together PEPFAR,

00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:54.280
were about $1,500 to
$2,500 per year per person.

00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:59.002
We're now down to $80, which
is pretty breathtaking.

00:46:59.002 --> 00:47:02.390
And generic competition
and manufacture actually

00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:04.330
had a lot to do with that.

00:47:04.330 --> 00:47:07.920
For us, intellectual property,
and for where we invest,

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:09.350
has not yet been a huge issue.

00:47:09.350 --> 00:47:11.099
Because the vast
majority of the countries

00:47:11.099 --> 00:47:14.368
we work in don't have
intellectual property laws.

00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:21.860
And because most of
the companies now,

00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:24.100
and it took a lot
of advocacy and took

00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:27.070
a lot of public beating
up to get them there,

00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:30.650
but most of the companies now
don't enforce their patents

00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:35.260
even where they exist in low
and low-middle income countries.

00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:38.880
The tricky part is
upper-middle income countries.

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:42.710
And that's where complications
are starting to arise.

00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:44.354
We don't actually
support countries

00:47:44.354 --> 00:47:46.770
to buy a lot of-- by the time
we're in upper-middle income

00:47:46.770 --> 00:47:51.230
countries, we're mostly
investing in civil society

00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:53.300
strengthening, key
affected populations,

00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:57.350
human rights-focused efforts,
rather than large procurements

00:47:57.350 --> 00:48:00.160
because the countries do those.

00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:03.650
But there are other groups
that work on this issue.

00:48:03.650 --> 00:48:07.881
And there is a new
UN commission on it.

00:48:07.881 --> 00:48:08.380
It's tough.

00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:10.830
I mean, there was a study
published a couple months ago

00:48:10.830 --> 00:48:13.470
that showed that countries
that issued compulsory licenses

00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:17.070
actually paid more for products
than countries that didn't

00:48:17.070 --> 00:48:18.900
issue compulsory licenses.

00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:21.520
But the threat of the
compulsory license

00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:24.220
probably led to the companies
reducing their prices

00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:26.440
to a level that
allowed for that.

00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:31.050
So it's a complex environment.

00:48:31.050 --> 00:48:32.456
We are not overly
engaged in that

00:48:32.456 --> 00:48:34.080
because we're not a
trade organization.

00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:35.960
We're not a technical
organization.

00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:38.800
There are organizations that
do, and we partner with them.

00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:39.764
Unitade is one.

00:48:39.764 --> 00:48:41.430
Medicines Patent Pool,
which is actually

00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:44.110
a cool mechanism whereby
countries give away--

00:48:44.110 --> 00:48:50.596
most companies now, most of them
just give away their licenses

00:48:50.596 --> 00:48:52.470
to a generic manufacturer
because they're not

00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:55.150
going make any money
of it off anyway.

00:48:55.150 --> 00:48:59.270
It is a problem for
TB and malaria drugs.

00:48:59.270 --> 00:49:01.720
And we're a little more
engaged, but we mostly partner

00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:04.080
with the groups that are
heavily engaged in that.

00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:05.808
UNAIDS is very involved, UNDP.

00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:11.860
There is potentially
another round of Doha.

00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:13.110
It's been blocked for a while.

00:49:13.110 --> 00:49:15.610
There are free trade
agreements, which some people

00:49:15.610 --> 00:49:17.940
think are going backwards.

00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:20.065
But I'm not competent
to talk about those.

00:49:20.065 --> 00:49:21.770
There is a body of literature.

00:49:21.770 --> 00:49:23.560
Medicine [INAUDIBLE]
is very involved.

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:24.630
Oxfam's very involved.

00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:27.380
So there is a body of literature
if you'd like to look at it.

00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:29.520
We're less directly engaged
because we're really

00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:31.890
a financing mechanism,
not a technical agency.

00:49:31.890 --> 00:49:34.120
We partner with
the groups that do.

00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:36.850
There are really issues,
but they're complicated.

00:49:36.850 --> 00:49:40.940
And like everything,
dogma and simple answers

00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:42.440
probably isn't it.

00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:44.847
There's something in between.

00:49:44.847 --> 00:49:47.180
I was talking to the CEO of
a big pharmaceutical company

00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:51.340
about intellectual property--
and unfortunately very few CEOs

00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:53.760
feel this way these
days, there was a time--

00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:56.135
he was like, look, intellectual
property doesn't give you

00:49:56.135 --> 00:49:58.400
the right to charge
whatever you want to charge.

00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:02.530
And it's the area
under the curve.

00:50:02.530 --> 00:50:06.060
If you sell 100 things for
$1 or one thing for $100,

00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:07.500
you make the same
amount of money.

00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:12.130
So there's an in-between
between access and pricing,

00:50:12.130 --> 00:50:14.470
which unfortunately, because
of shareholders and a lot

00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:18.780
of other stuff, some of the
pharmaceutical companies today

00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:20.410
remind me of the
railroad companies

00:50:20.410 --> 00:50:25.100
or the electrical companies
that are just outrageous what's

00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:26.230
happening.

00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:29.320
But at the same time,
you need some incentive

00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:32.110
to continue to invest in,
say, producing a new TB

00:50:32.110 --> 00:50:33.750
drug or a new malaria drug.

00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:37.880
And if there's no
protection of any kind--

00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:40.740
we've actually created something
as an innovation which we hope

00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:43.661
is kind of an in-between
that could solve the problem.

00:50:43.661 --> 00:50:45.160
The reason for
intellectual property

00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:46.618
is to have a market,
just basically

00:50:46.618 --> 00:50:48.830
have a long-term market
to recover costs,

00:50:48.830 --> 00:50:50.840
which get grossly inflated.

00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:52.100
And we know they do.

00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:54.630
So we had this great idea.

00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:56.810
You know, pooled procurement
works really well.

00:50:56.810 --> 00:50:59.310
It brings prices down, a great
way to bring prices down.

00:50:59.310 --> 00:51:06.090
We now have innovators
out bidding generics

00:51:06.090 --> 00:51:07.932
because they know
what their volume is.

00:51:07.932 --> 00:51:09.640
So as long as you can
guarantee a volume,

00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:11.098
you can actually
reduce your price.

00:51:11.098 --> 00:51:13.080
If you can't guarantee
a volume, then you're

00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:15.350
kind of spot pricing.

00:51:15.350 --> 00:51:19.050
So we had the insight that if
we pooled procurement and made

00:51:19.050 --> 00:51:20.780
it available, which
we'd been doing,

00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:23.620
but we'd been managing it, we
could really reduce prices.

00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:26.490
So in the last two years, we
reduced the price of bed nets

00:51:26.490 --> 00:51:29.730
for malaria by
40%, in two years,

00:51:29.730 --> 00:51:32.980
by just pooling the
procurement and negotiating.

00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:34.060
But that's us doing it.

00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:36.340
What happens to a country
when we're not there

00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:38.020
to do it for them anymore?

00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:39.604
So we challenged
our procurement team

00:51:39.604 --> 00:51:41.520
to come up with a solution,
and they came back

00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:43.530
with a simple brilliant thing
which probably half of you

00:51:43.530 --> 00:51:44.488
in the room thought of.

00:51:44.488 --> 00:51:47.820
So we basically created a
Kayak.com, Priceline.com

00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:49.810
for health commodities.

00:51:49.810 --> 00:51:51.230
It's called Wambo.org.

00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:53.870
We just launched it, actually.

00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:57.530
And we believe this will
be the pathway, eventually,

00:51:57.530 --> 00:52:01.370
to have open competition
for medical products,

00:52:01.370 --> 00:52:03.205
not just the ones we deal.

00:52:03.205 --> 00:52:05.580
We actually want to spin it
off to a global public health

00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:07.615
good so that all
health commodities can

00:52:07.615 --> 00:52:10.830
be on it as a global public
health good with no skimming

00:52:10.830 --> 00:52:14.920
of money so that you will have
predictable markets, long term

00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:18.250
markets, which would then allow
for pricing that might overcome

00:52:18.250 --> 00:52:19.640
some of these issues.

00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:21.620
The other piece of it
is it also promotes

00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:22.640
innovation of companies.

00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:27.270
If you talk to companies
in Africa or China

00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:30.370
for that matter, no one will
invest in quality assurance

00:52:30.370 --> 00:52:35.900
and getting quality products or
even in the product themselves,

00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:37.090
because there's no market.

00:52:37.090 --> 00:52:39.006
The question every
investor has is how are you

00:52:39.006 --> 00:52:41.190
going to out compete
country by country,

00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:45.450
open up a market in 75
countries, on your own?

00:52:45.450 --> 00:52:46.880
There's no access.

00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:48.470
This will give automatic access.

00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:50.020
All you have to do is
have a quality product.

00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:52.390
And it will go on there, and you
can price it wherever you want.

00:52:52.390 --> 00:52:53.640
And you can drive
the price changes.

00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:56.300
So we think this will stimulate
innovation and commodities.

00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:59.390
We think it will stimulate
a price reduction,

00:52:59.390 --> 00:53:01.570
and it's a simple
technological solution.

00:53:01.570 --> 00:53:04.010
It's also a way that if
you have a long enough term

00:53:04.010 --> 00:53:07.190
predictability, the smart
companies will start pricing

00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:08.200
in a much different way.

00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:09.741
And then intellectual
property, which

00:53:09.741 --> 00:53:11.640
was your protective
mechanism, might

00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:14.000
be a little less necessary.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.120
AUDIENCE: What's that
name of the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:21.330
MARK DYBUL: It's called
Wambo.org, W-A-M-B-O dot O-R-G.

00:53:21.330 --> 00:53:22.410
You would understand why.

00:53:22.410 --> 00:53:23.993
I was like, why the
hell would we pick

00:53:23.993 --> 00:53:25.770
a name that no one understands?

00:53:25.770 --> 00:53:27.290
Did you know what Yahoo meant?

00:53:27.290 --> 00:53:28.260
Did you know what Google meant?

00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:28.760
No.

00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:31.710
So you create a word
that means nothing really

00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:36.620
and turn it into something
that has a meaning on its own.

00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:38.050
So it's in its early stages.

00:53:38.050 --> 00:53:39.258
We actually just launched it.

00:53:39.258 --> 00:53:42.230
It was a massive effort.

00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:44.060
For now, it's just
available to some

00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:47.290
of what we call principle
implementers, the people

00:53:47.290 --> 00:53:48.160
we fund.

00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:49.618
By the end of the
year, we're going

00:53:49.618 --> 00:53:51.530
to let any country
that wants to use it

00:53:51.530 --> 00:53:53.390
for HIV, TB, and malaria.

00:53:53.390 --> 00:53:56.370
And then our goal is
within the next year

00:53:56.370 --> 00:53:58.534
to work with other global
health organizations

00:53:58.534 --> 00:54:01.200
to create a governance mechanism
to turn it into a global health

00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:01.760
good.

00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:04.760
You could see the VA
and the National Health

00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:06.792
Services starting to use this.

00:54:06.792 --> 00:54:08.820
We'll get into a lot
of trouble, actually,

00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:13.420
when it gets to that
point, but it will be fun.

00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:16.190
I think we're at
your 6:00-- it's

00:54:16.190 --> 00:54:19.347
your bird saying it's
time for happy hour.

00:54:19.347 --> 00:54:21.430
MALE SPEAKER: I think that
cue to finish has come.

00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:25.420
This is our Heidi song, and it
means that TGIF is starting.

00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:27.330
So for the two of
you in the room

00:54:27.330 --> 00:54:32.340
that don't know what that
means, please have a beer.

00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:33.495
Thank you very much, Mark.

00:54:33.495 --> 00:54:34.870
It's been great
listening to you.

00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:38.520
[APPLAUSE]
