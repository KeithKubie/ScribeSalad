I'm gonna try and capture contain and

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030
I'm gonna try and capture contain and
 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.559
I'm gonna try and capture contain and
investigate a higher dimensional sphere

00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:05.569
investigate a higher dimensional sphere
 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:08.960
investigate a higher dimensional sphere
starting with a circle so if we begin in

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970
starting with a circle so if we begin in
 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.030
starting with a circle so if we begin in
2d you've come across circles before

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040
2d you've come across circles before
 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.280
2d you've come across circles before
they look you know roughly like that

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290
they look you know roughly like that
 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.970
they look you know roughly like that
we're gonna try and contain a circle so

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980
we're gonna try and contain a circle so
 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.400
we're gonna try and contain a circle so
we can look at how big it can be so what

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410
we can look at how big it can be so what
 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.260
we can look at how big it can be so what
I'm gonna do is start with a box four by

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270
I'm gonna do is start with a box four by
 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.970
I'm gonna do is start with a box four by
four for reasons I'll explain about it

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980
four for reasons I'll explain about it
 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.529
four for reasons I'll explain about it
so that's four units that way it's four

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539
so that's four units that way it's four
 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.150
so that's four units that way it's four
units that way and now I'm going to put

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160
units that way and now I'm going to put
 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.700
units that way and now I'm going to put
some safety padding spheres in there so

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710
some safety padding spheres in there so
 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.290
some safety padding spheres in there so
if you kind of measure if I was to

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300
if you kind of measure if I was to
 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.359
if you kind of measure if I was to
actually split this into quarters I'm

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369
actually split this into quarters I'm
 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.860
actually split this into quarters I'm
gonna put safety fears

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870
gonna put safety fears
 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.410
gonna put safety fears
well they're their circles I'm gonna

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420
well they're their circles I'm gonna
 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.270
well they're their circles I'm gonna
call them spheres no matter what

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280
call them spheres no matter what
 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.520
call them spheres no matter what
dimension they're in right so when I say

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530
dimension they're in right so when I say
 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.830
dimension they're in right so when I say
sphere I mean two DS fear it's a circle

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840
sphere I mean two DS fear it's a circle
 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.360
sphere I mean two DS fear it's a circle
so I'm not very good at drawing circles

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370
so I'm not very good at drawing circles
 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.090
so I'm not very good at drawing circles
so they're there be one there and it

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100
so they're there be one there and it
 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.970
so they're there be one there and it
just touches it kisses all four sides of

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980
just touches it kisses all four sides of
 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.000
just touches it kisses all four sides of
that box there'd be one there which just

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010
that box there'd be one there which just
 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.119
that box there'd be one there which just
touches or is that just context that's

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129
touches or is that just context that's
 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.090
touches or is that just context that's
sphere so that just contacts there and

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100
sphere so that just contacts there and
 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.470
sphere so that just contacts there and
that one just contacts there

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480
that one just contacts there
 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.280
that one just contacts there
and so that's adequate okay that's

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290
and so that's adequate okay that's
 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.179
and so that's adequate okay that's
little do it'll do they're not

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189
little do it'll do they're not
 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.460
little do it'll do they're not
overlapping apart so meanwhile so this

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470
overlapping apart so meanwhile so this
 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.960
overlapping apart so meanwhile so this
is why I made the box four by four

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970
is why I made the box four by four
 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.359
is why I made the box four by four
because it means these in a unit spheres

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369
because it means these in a unit spheres
 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.580
because it means these in a unit spheres
or unit circles so they all have a

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590
or unit circles so they all have a
 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.380
or unit circles so they all have a
radius that's one in that direction one

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390
radius that's one in that direction one
 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.370
radius that's one in that direction one
they've all got one in every every

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380
they've all got one in every every
 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.380
they've all got one in every every
direction I'm now gonna see what is the

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390
direction I'm now gonna see what is the
 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.550
direction I'm now gonna see what is the
biggest circle I can fit in the middle

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560
biggest circle I can fit in the middle
 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.130
biggest circle I can fit in the middle
so I've got my containing box I've got

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140
so I've got my containing box I've got
 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.859
so I've got my containing box I've got
my padding spheres or circles I've now

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869
my padding spheres or circles I've now
 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.480
my padding spheres or circles I've now
got this is the subject this is the one

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490
got this is the subject this is the one
 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.980
got this is the subject this is the one
we care about and I'm now going to try

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990
we care about and I'm now going to try
 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.260
we care about and I'm now going to try
and fit the biggest circle possible in

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270
and fit the biggest circle possible in
 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.420
and fit the biggest circle possible in
the middle so how big is that circle

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430
the middle so how big is that circle
 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.179
the middle so how big is that circle
well there's the very middle of a box

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189
well there's the very middle of a box
 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.819
well there's the very middle of a box
here is the center of this padding

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829
here is the center of this padding
 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.039
here is the center of this padding
circle over here we know that's one that

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049
circle over here we know that's one that
 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.800
circle over here we know that's one that
way that's one that way so what we have

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810
way that's one that way so what we have
 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.569
way that's one that way so what we have
if we zoom in a little bit so that

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579
if we zoom in a little bit so that
 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.270
if we zoom in a little bit so that
complete length there that whole thing

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280
complete length there that whole thing
 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.730
complete length there that whole thing
is root 2 and that there is one that's a

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740
is root 2 and that there is one that's a
 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.080
is root 2 and that there is one that's a
little bit there is root 2 minus 1 which

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090
little bit there is root 2 minus 1 which
 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.560
little bit there is root 2 minus 1 which
equals around about 0.4 1/4 so that's

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570
equals around about 0.4 1/4 so that's
 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.850
equals around about 0.4 1/4 so that's
the biggest circle we can fit in the

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860
the biggest circle we can fit in the
 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.570
the biggest circle we can fit in the
middle in 2d onwards upwards to 3d for

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580
middle in 2d onwards upwards to 3d for
 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.400
middle in 2d onwards upwards to 3d for
3d we would have a Q

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410
3d we would have a Q
 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.590
3d we would have a Q
with eight padding spheres and so I've

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600
with eight padding spheres and so I've
 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.260
with eight padding spheres and so I've
brought oranges these are the the

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270
brought oranges these are the the
 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.330
brought oranges these are the the
cheapest spheres I could find in the

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340
cheapest spheres I could find in the
 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.510
cheapest spheres I could find in the
grocery store and so that that's the

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520
grocery store and so that that's the
 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.680
grocery store and so that that's the
rough equivalent of what we had before

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690
rough equivalent of what we had before
 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:25.970
rough equivalent of what we had before
you know I only think they can you know

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980
you know I only think they can you know
 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:33.020
you know I only think they can you know
I guess I'm gonna tape them play yeah

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030
I guess I'm gonna tape them play yeah
 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.160
I guess I'm gonna tape them play yeah
and those go on there so I haven't got

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170
and those go on there so I haven't got
 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.010
and those go on there so I haven't got
the containing box but you can imagine

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020
the containing box but you can imagine
 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.760
the containing box but you can imagine
that there is the base is still four by

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770
that there is the base is still four by
 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.920
that there is the base is still four by
four that we had previously

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930
four that we had previously
 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.830
four that we had previously
that's four in every direction but now

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840
that's four in every direction but now
 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.200
that's four in every direction but now
as well as four by four we'd have

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210
as well as four by four we'd have
 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.030
as well as four by four we'd have
another length up here so we'd have

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040
another length up here so we'd have
 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.680
another length up here so we'd have
another dimension this way which is also

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690
another dimension this way which is also
 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.780
another dimension this way which is also
four and then here's the top of our four

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790
four and then here's the top of our four
 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.380
four and then here's the top of our four
by four box and we can fit twice as many

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390
by four box and we can fit twice as many
 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.760
by four box and we can fit twice as many
see as in as last time so four spheres

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770
see as in as last time so four spheres
 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.990
see as in as last time so four spheres
in 2d eight spheres in 3d and you can

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000
in 2d eight spheres in 3d and you can
 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.820
in 2d eight spheres in 3d and you can
see again there's a gap in the middle

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830
see again there's a gap in the middle
 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.160
see again there's a gap in the middle
right so inside our box is that our

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170
right so inside our box is that our
 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.800
right so inside our box is that our
padding spheres in there is a void and

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810
padding spheres in there is a void and
 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.310
padding spheres in there is a void and
the question is what is the biggest 3d

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320
the question is what is the biggest 3d
 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.720
the question is what is the biggest 3d
sphere that we can fit inside inside

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730
sphere that we can fit inside inside
 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.860
sphere that we can fit inside inside
there here are four adequate you know

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870
there here are four adequate you know
 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.400
there here are four adequate you know
that okay so that's back on yeah they're

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410
that okay so that's back on yeah they're
 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.750
that okay so that's back on yeah they're
getting to know each other very well and

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760
getting to know each other very well and
 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.020
getting to know each other very well and
so who am I to judge so that is like the

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030
so who am I to judge so that is like the
 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.540
so who am I to judge so that is like the
cross-section in here that lines up with

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550
cross-section in here that lines up with
 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:36.950
cross-section in here that lines up with
the middle of the bottom layer of

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:36.960
the middle of the bottom layer of
 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.600
the middle of the bottom layer of
spheres so what we've done already is

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610
spheres so what we've done already is
 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.790
spheres so what we've done already is
for the center point here in the middle

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800
for the center point here in the middle
 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.370
for the center point here in the middle
we know from the middle of this one it's

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380
we know from the middle of this one it's
 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.250
we know from the middle of this one it's
one across to get there it's one up to

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260
one across to get there it's one up to
 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.060
one across to get there it's one up to
get there and so that diagonal was root

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070
get there and so that diagonal was root
 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.640
get there and so that diagonal was root
two and then before we subtracted off

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650
two and then before we subtracted off
 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.050
two and then before we subtracted off
the radius just to get the difference

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060
the radius just to get the difference
 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.940
the radius just to get the difference
there but now we want to we need to go

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950
there but now we want to we need to go
 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.820
there but now we want to we need to go
one aren't we to go up as well and again

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830
one aren't we to go up as well and again
 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.710
one aren't we to go up as well and again
it's another quarter of the whole box so

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720
it's another quarter of the whole box so
 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.710
it's another quarter of the whole box so
we have to go up a single unit and so we

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720
we have to go up a single unit and so we
 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.280
we have to go up a single unit and so we
do Pythagoras with that our base is now

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290
do Pythagoras with that our base is now
 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.100
do Pythagoras with that our base is now
root two and then our height is one and

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110
root two and then our height is one and
 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.930
root two and then our height is one and
so to work out what that is root 2

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940
so to work out what that is root 2
 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.570
so to work out what that is root 2
squared is 2 one squared is one that

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580
squared is 2 one squared is one that
 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.030
squared is 2 one squared is one that
there is root three and actually

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040
there is root three and actually
 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.480
there is root three and actually

straight forwards that's gonna make our

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350
straight forwards that's gonna make our
 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.530
straight forwards that's gonna make our
lives very easy going forward and once

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540
lives very easy going forward and once
 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.080

again that diagonal we want the

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090
again that diagonal we want the
 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.820
again that diagonal we want the
difference between the radius of the

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830
difference between the radius of the
 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.960
difference between the radius of the
sphere and what's left and so I knew

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970
sphere and what's left and so I knew
 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.630
sphere and what's left and so I knew
radius of the biggest sphere we can fit

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640
radius of the biggest sphere we can fit
 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:51.220
radius of the biggest sphere we can fit
in there is root 3 minus 1 which equals

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230
 
 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:56.330
 
0.732 you know 0 5 some stuff ok

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340
0.732 you know 0 5 some stuff ok
 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.490
0.732 you know 0 5 some stuff ok
so actually it's slightly bigger and

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500
so actually it's slightly bigger and
 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.750
so actually it's slightly bigger and
that kind of makes sense because you

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760
that kind of makes sense because you
 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.040
that kind of makes sense because you
know there's not much room there to fit

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050
know there's not much room there to fit
 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.480
know there's not much room there to fit

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.420
of the central sphere in 4d is root 4
which is 2 minus 1 which is 1 so now the

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:29.430
which is 2 minus 1 which is 1 so now the
 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.240
which is 2 minus 1 which is 1 so now the
