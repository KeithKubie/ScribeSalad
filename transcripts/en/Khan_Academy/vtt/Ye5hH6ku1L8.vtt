00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.620
- [Instructor] In this video,
we're going to talk about

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.060
the quantity theory of
money which is based

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.540
on what is known as the
equation of exchange

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.350
and it tries to relate
the money supply, M,

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.623
so this is some measure
of the money supply,

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.650
with the real GDP, Y,

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.010
so that is real GDP,

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.990
and the price level, P,
so this is price level,

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.920
and we'll try to make
this tangible in a second,

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.240
and then it also introduces this idea

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.870
of the velocity of money

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.110
which is a measure of how
much that money supply

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.070
is how quickly is it circulating.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.320
If there's a dollar out
there, how many times per year

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.180
is it actually changing hands?

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.540
Velocity of money.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.040
And the equation of exchange that is used

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.670
in the quantity theory of money

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.890
relates these as following,

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.360
that the money supply

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.700
times the velocity of money

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.060
is equal to

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.610
your price level

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.580
times your real GDP.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.730
And we can view this on a per year basis.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.240
So let's make this a little bit tangible.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.970
And actually, let's
try to make it tangible

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.970
by making velocity tangible.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.440
Let's say we are in a world where

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.510
we have whatever we're using for M,

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.950
whatever measure of our money supply,

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.580
let's say it says that we have 10 billion,

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.000
it's a relatively small economy,
that is our money supply.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.720
And let's say that our real
GDP in this economy this year

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.720
is going to be a 100 billion,

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.760
I'll just call it per year,

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.030
and let's say the price level,

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.807
and this is usually some
type of index, this is 1.1

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.320
so one way to think about it,
if you take your price level

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.860
times your real GDP, so
if you take this product

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.750
right over here, that's gonna
give you your nominal GDP

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.080
where if this was 1.0,
that would be in reference

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.760
to some year that you
consider your base year.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.050
So, this would be your real
GDP in terms of that base year

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.770
and then you would multiply
it times this right over here

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.740
to get your nominal GDP.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.430
But given this information,
pause this video

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.050
and try to figure out what
the velocity of money would be

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.560
for that year.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.750
Well, this is relatively
straightforward algebra.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.150
To solve for V, we just
divide both sides by M

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.650
and we would get that our
velocity of money in this year

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.650
is equal to our price
level times our real GDP

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.290
divided by our amount of money.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.420
And so, this is going to be equal to,

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.067
we have 1.1

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.763
times 100 billion,

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.763
100 billion dollars per year,

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.993
divided by 10 billion dollars.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.021
So, what is this going to be?

00:03:02.021 --> 00:03:07.021
1.1 times a 100 is a
110 divided by 10 is 11.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.700
So we are going to get, this
is going to be equal to 11.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.080
The dollar units would actually cancel out

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.670
and all you're left with if you tried

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.650
to look at the units is 11 times per year.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.680
And so, one way of interpreting this

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.390
is for these numbers, your average dollar

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.100
is going to circulate 11 times per year.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.770
If this idea still seems
too abstract to you,

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:33.970
think of it this way.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.620
Let's have an extreme economy
where we only have two parties

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.620
and let's assume that our price
level is just a simple one,

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.100
in which case, our real
GDP would be the same

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.560
as our nominal GDP, and let's say

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.600
that our GDP this year
is 100 billion dollars,

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.110
100 billion dollars per year,

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.590
and let's take an extreme situation where

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.600
the amount of money that we have

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.620
is also 100 billion.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.280
Well, this would be a world,
if there's only two people

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.410
in this economy, or maybe this person

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.240
just pays that person 100 billion dollars

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.440
in order to get that much worth of output.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.440
And so, every dollar has
just switched hand once.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.440
So the velocity of
money in this situation,

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.230
it would be just one time per year.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.430
But imagine another scenario where

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.840
instead of M being equal
to a 100 billion dollars,

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.633
imagine a situation
where M is equal to $1,

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.300
where there's only $1 there.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.700
You could still have a
GDP of 100 billion dollars

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.360
because that $1 could just switch hands

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.150
a 100 billion times.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.260
It would have to happen quite rapidly

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.690
for a dollar happened in the year,

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.150
but this person could buy a dollar's worth

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.450
of goods and services from this person

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:50.490
and that person buys a dollar's worth

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:51.570
of goods and services from that person

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.070
and it would go back and
forth 100 billions times.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.070
And so, in this situation
where you still have

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.280
the same real, and actually nominal, GDP,

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.210
if your amount of money is
one-one hundred billionth,

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:06.690
then your velocity would have to be

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.360
a 100 billion times higher.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.560
Now, the folks who like to think about

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.540
this equation of exchange and
the quantity theory of money,

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.593
they're often known as monetarists,

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.940
and monetarists believe that inflation

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.240
is fundamentally a monetary phenomenon,

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.410
that if you increase the money supply,

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.560
that that's going to lead
to increased inflation

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.690
and if you decrease the money supply,

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.860
that might slow inflation
or even result in deflation.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.640
So if you want to think about
inflation in terms of money,

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.860
we could solve for P from this equation.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.300
So to solve for P, we would
just divide both sides

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.860
by our real GDP, and so you would get,

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.860
your price level is equal
to the amount of money

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:55.883
times your velocity,

00:05:58.318 --> 00:06:02.600
divided by real GDP.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.260
And these monetarists
will assume that velocity

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.100
is constant, although folks theorize

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.515
that maybe it's not constant,

00:06:09.515 --> 00:06:11.960
that technology for example, might make it

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.670
a little bit easier to transact

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:15.950
which might make velocity increase.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.680
There could also be a world
where just people's mindsets

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.380
make them wanna transact more or less

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.800
which could change velocity.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.340
But monetarists tend to
assume that this is constant

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.080
because it frankly allows
you to make conclusions

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.720
from this equation of exchange.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.710
And monetarists also assume
that changes in the money supply

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:38.690
will not have an impact on
real output in the long run.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.860
So, not impacted

00:06:43.337 --> 00:06:47.107
by M in the long-run.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.530
Well, if you assume that these two things

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:51.840
are relatively constant,

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.810
well then, you will see
this direct relationship

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:56.530
between your price level

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.680
and the quantity of money.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.760
Now in practice, this is likely to be

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.210
an oversimplification like
most of our economics models.

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:09.820
For example, coming out of the
last recession of 2008-2009,

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.010
the federal reserve
practiced quantitative easing

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:16.310
where they dramatically
increased the money supply

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.230
right over here, but we
did not see a commensurate

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:23.440
dramatic increase in
inflation, in the price level.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.270
Now, some folks could argue
that when the federal reserve

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:29.640
in 2008 dramatically
increased the money supply

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.490
without a dramatic
increase in price levels,

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:36.190
it might've been because the
velocity of money went down,

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:37.910
that people weren't actually transacting

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:40.740
with all of that money
that was being injected

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:41.670
into the system.

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:42.770
Who knows?

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:44.790
And if you're always able to use velocity

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:46.790
as a bit of a fudge factor, well then

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:50.080
it puts into debate of
how useful this might be.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.860
But needless to say, it
is an interesting model

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:55.830
to at least think about,
that if the money supply

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:58.160
were to increase dramatically
and people transact

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.990
at roughly the same rate,
but the actual output

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:03.280
that the economy is
producing isn't changing,

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.030
it makes some level of common sense

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:07.560
that maybe that would increase
increase the price level.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.373
You would have more money
chasing the same output.
