00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.540
&gt;&gt; Hi Anita. I'm Helene Gayle. I'm President
and CEO of CARE, an international organization

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:15.900
focusing on eliminating extreme poverty. We
have put, as a focus of our organization on

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.100
improving the lives and empowering women and
girls because we know that both women and

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.660
girls are disproportionately impacted by poverty,
but also hold the solution for ending extreme

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:33.630
poverty. Because we know when you invest in
women and girls they are real change agents

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.910
of their society, but we also know that they
focus on girls, can get lost and that's why

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:46.320
your story Anita, and this panel is so important
because we know that it is by focusing on

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.870
girls that you have the best chance of changing
societies and really tapping in to the root

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:59.300
causes of many of the problems that we all
face and are trying to solve. So I am just

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:05.690
so happy to be able to be here and talk about
the value of the "Girl Effect" and why we

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:12.490
all have to do what we can. Do our part from
wherever we are. Wether we're policy makers,

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.460
program implementers, advocates, government
officials, all of us have a part to play.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.510
All of us have a role to make this "Girl Effect"
in development come alive and be able to make

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:29.410
what is the best investment for saving humanity
by investing in girls.
