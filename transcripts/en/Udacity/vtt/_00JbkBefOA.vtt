00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.400
It's most likely Hsiao-Lu isn't transcribing or translating

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.680
her gene as an adult. Even though she

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.490
could as a child. This would result in

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.300
a decrease lactase activtiy, but increase lactose intolerance symptoms.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.790
&gt;&gt; &gt;Exactly the reason it's not likely she has

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.330
a mutation or an allele of the lactase gene that

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.170
doesn't work or is non-functional. Is because we know she

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.980
could digest lactose products as a baby, if she had

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.780
a lactase gene that didn't work at all, then she would also not have been

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.800
able to drink milk as a baby. Which would have been problematic in general. So

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.350
the fact that she could drink milk as a baby means that its most likely

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.610
that she has a functioning lactase gene but its just turned off, as an adult.
