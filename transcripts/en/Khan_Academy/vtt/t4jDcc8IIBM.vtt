00:00:00.757 --> 00:00:03.825
- Amanda lives in Fairbanks, Alaska.

00:00:03.825 --> 00:00:06.629
The table below shows
the temperature changes

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.387
in Fairbanks over a two-hour period.

00:00:10.387 --> 00:00:12.702
So when we went from 3pm to 4pm

00:00:12.702 --> 00:00:15.690
the temperature increased
by two degrees Celsius,

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.741
and then from four to five the temperature

00:00:17.741 --> 00:00:20.850
decreased by five degrees Celsius.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.857
Amanda notices the temperature at 5pm

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:26.925
is negative nine degrees Celsius.

00:00:26.925 --> 00:00:30.440
What was the temperature
in Fairbanks at 3pm?

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.045
So they're essentially
telling us the temperature

00:00:32.045 --> 00:00:33.752
at the end of these changes,

00:00:33.752 --> 00:00:35.215
and they want us to
figure out the temperature

00:00:35.215 --> 00:00:37.961
at the beginning of these changes.

00:00:37.961 --> 00:00:39.647
So let's see if we can do that.

00:00:39.647 --> 00:00:40.927
Let me draw.

00:00:40.927 --> 00:00:43.690
Since, in thermometers we're
used to thinking vertically.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.519
So I'll draw a vertical number line here

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:47.717
to think about this a little bit.

00:00:47.717 --> 00:00:51.536
So here we go.

00:00:51.845 --> 00:00:54.181
Alright, so at 5pm we end up at

00:00:54.181 --> 00:00:56.152
negative nine degrees Celsius,

00:00:56.152 --> 00:00:59.103
so let's just say this
is zero, negative one,

00:00:59.103 --> 00:01:04.103
two, three, four, five, six,

00:01:04.141 --> 00:01:06.600
seven, eight, nine.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.013
So we end up at negative
nine degrees Celsius.

00:01:10.013 --> 00:01:13.975
This is zero degrees
Celsius right over here.

00:01:13.975 --> 00:01:15.113
So from zero...

00:01:15.113 --> 00:01:20.113
Sorry, from 4pm to 5pm
the temperature dropped

00:01:20.354 --> 00:01:22.650
by five degrees Celsius

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.393
and that got us to negative nine.

00:01:25.393 --> 00:01:28.806
So we drop by five to
get to negative nine,

00:01:28.806 --> 00:01:31.041
so we must've started
five above negative nine.

00:01:31.041 --> 00:01:33.520
So one, two, three, four, five...

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.084
Right over here.

00:01:35.084 --> 00:01:36.912
So this is that drop.

00:01:36.912 --> 00:01:39.412
This is that five degree drop.

00:01:39.412 --> 00:01:43.052
Like we said, one, two, three, four, five.

00:01:43.052 --> 00:01:45.795
So that's that five degree
drop right over here.

00:01:45.795 --> 00:01:49.207
This is a negative five degrees Celsius.

00:01:49.207 --> 00:01:54.207
So at 4pm, right at 4pm, we
must've had a temperature of...

00:01:55.852 --> 00:01:59.793
Well, five above negative nine
is going to be negative four.

00:01:59.793 --> 00:02:01.500
Negative four degrees Celsius.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.852
This is what the temperature was at 4pm.

00:02:04.852 --> 00:02:09.626
So this is at 4pm.

00:02:09.626 --> 00:02:11.882
And then, to figure out 3pm,

00:02:11.882 --> 00:02:13.974
remember when we go from 3pm to 4pm

00:02:13.974 --> 00:02:16.859
our temperature increased
two degrees Celsius.

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:21.593
So we increased by two
degrees Celsius from that hour

00:02:21.593 --> 00:02:24.802
to get to negative four degrees Celsius.

00:02:24.802 --> 00:02:27.973
So we increased by two degrees Celsius.

00:02:27.973 --> 00:02:30.709
So if we increase by two degrees Celsius

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.117
to get to negative four, that means at 3pm

00:02:33.117 --> 00:02:35.027
we must've been two below that.

00:02:35.027 --> 00:02:37.546
So this is what we did from three to four.

00:02:37.546 --> 00:02:40.369
&gt;From three to four we increased by two

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:43.885
to get to negative four.

00:02:43.885 --> 00:02:47.380
So this right over here is
the plus two degrees Celsius

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.477
right over there.

00:02:48.477 --> 00:02:52.276
So we must've started right here at 3pm.

00:02:52.276 --> 00:02:54.897
We must've started right there at 3pm.

00:02:54.897 --> 00:02:56.055
All I did is underline this.

00:02:56.055 --> 00:02:58.615
If you know we're at
negative nine to end with,

00:02:58.615 --> 00:03:01.013
and from four to five
we dropped negative five

00:03:01.013 --> 00:03:03.065
to get there, that means
at four we must've been

00:03:03.065 --> 00:03:05.259
five above negative nine.

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:06.803
So we're at negative four,

00:03:06.803 --> 00:03:08.408
and then from three to four,

00:03:08.408 --> 00:03:11.232
if we increased two degrees to get there,

00:03:11.232 --> 00:03:12.979
that means at three we must've been

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:15.539
two degrees below negative four.

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:19.399
So this right over here is
negative six degrees Celsius.

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:22.894
So what was the temperature
in Fairbanks at 3pm?

00:03:22.894 --> 00:03:25.474
It was negative six degrees Celsius.

00:03:25.474 --> 00:03:26.998
And you can verify that.

00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:30.066
If you start at negative six, you add two,

00:03:30.066 --> 00:03:31.630
you get to negative four,

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.332
and then you subtract five,
you get to negative nine,

00:03:34.332 --> 00:03:37.083
which is exactly what we had here.
