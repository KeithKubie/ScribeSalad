you can kind of look in a few shots and

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:05.190
you can kind of look in a few shots and
 

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:07.910
you can kind of look in a few shots and
be like that's definitely a cgi upper

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:07.920
be like that's definitely a cgi upper
 

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.680

lip but it's not the kind of thing that

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:09.690
lip but it's not the kind of thing that
 

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:11.450
lip but it's not the kind of thing that
would tank a movie it's just noticeable

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:11.460
would tank a movie it's just noticeable
 

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:13.130
would tank a movie it's just noticeable
in a few scenes but again my biggest

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:13.140
in a few scenes but again my biggest
 

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:14.630
in a few scenes but again my biggest
issue with this film is that it does

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:14.640
issue with this film is that it does
 

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.760
issue with this film is that it does
feel rushed and I think if you delete

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:16.770
feel rushed and I think if you delete
 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.860
feel rushed and I think if you delete
the production issues and just not even

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:18.870
the production issues and just not even
 

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.140
the production issues and just not even
think about that I think I would boil it

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:21.150
think about that I think I would boil it
 

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.270
think about that I think I would boil it

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.550
down to Warner Brothers mandate that it

they save funny things and so you can
 

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.410
they save funny things and so you can

watching this but there just wasn't as

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:47.610
watching this but there just wasn't as
 

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:49.910
watching this but there just wasn't as
much depth in the team as I wish there

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:49.920
much depth in the team as I wish there
 

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.770

could have been when you have to put

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:51.780
could have been when you have to put
 

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.590
could have been when you have to put
certain things into a movie to set up

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:54.600
certain things into a movie to set up
 

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.810
certain things into a movie to set up
other films and that's the only reason

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:56.820
other films and that's the only reason
 

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.640
other films and that's the only reason
it really fits into this movie you're

00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:58.650
it really fits into this movie you're
 

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:00.470
it really fits into this movie you're
gonna get into some messy plot points

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:00.480
gonna get into some messy plot points
 

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.760
gonna get into some messy plot points
and you're gonna get into some things

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:01.770
and you're gonna get into some things
 

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:03.950
and you're gonna get into some things
that don't really work and that's the

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:03.960
that don't really work and that's the
 

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.810
that don't really work and that's the
biggest issue of all cinematic universes

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:05.820
biggest issue of all cinematic universes
 

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.430

something else I would have liked to

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:07.440
something else I would have liked to
 

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.320
something else I would have liked to
have seen is a little more squabbling

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:09.330
have seen is a little more squabbling
 

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.180
have seen is a little more squabbling
amongst the team more character

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:11.190
amongst the team more character
 

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:12.560
amongst the team more character
confrontations things that they

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:12.570
confrontations things that they
 

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:14.660
confrontations things that they
disagreed on because the scenes in which

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:14.670
disagreed on because the scenes in which
 

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:17.150
disagreed on because the scenes in which
characters on the Justice League fought

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:17.160
characters on the Justice League fought
 

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.340
characters on the Justice League fought
or disagreed I thought were some of the

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:19.350
or disagreed I thought were some of the
 

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:22.040
or disagreed I thought were some of the
best in the entire film but it's brushed

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:22.050
best in the entire film but it's brushed
 

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:25.010
best in the entire film but it's brushed
over so quickly to get to everyone

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:25.020
over so quickly to get to everyone
 

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:27.830

just more character confrontations
 

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.400
just more character confrontations
because that would give us more depth on

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:34.410
because that would give us more depth on
 

00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:36.110
because that would give us more depth on
the team it would give us more reasons

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:36.120
