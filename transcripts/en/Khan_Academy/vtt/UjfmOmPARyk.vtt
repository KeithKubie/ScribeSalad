00:00:00.245 --> 00:00:02.758
- Let's think about ways to break up addition problems.

00:00:02.758 --> 00:00:03.786
And this is useful,

00:00:03.786 --> 00:00:05.783
because if we break them up in the right way,

00:00:05.783 --> 00:00:09.612
it might be easier for us to actually compute the addition.

00:00:09.612 --> 00:00:11.704
So let's look at this first question.

00:00:11.704 --> 00:00:15.250
Lindsay isn't sure how to add 39 plus 61.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.544
Help Lindsay by choosing an addition problem that is

00:00:17.544 --> 00:00:20.944
the same as 39 plus 61.

00:00:20.944 --> 00:00:22.524
So let's look at these choices.

00:00:22.524 --> 00:00:25.296
This first choose I have 30 plus 60

00:00:25.296 --> 00:00:26.582
plus 90 plus ten.

00:00:26.582 --> 00:00:27.766
And I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:30.378
and try to work this out actually before I do it.

00:00:30.378 --> 00:00:31.365
So this first choice,

00:00:31.365 --> 00:00:33.420
where do they get this 30 from?

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.195
Well, 30, that's three tens,

00:00:37.305 --> 00:00:39.775
and I do have three tens right over here.

00:00:39.776 --> 00:00:41.133
The three in 39,

00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:44.662
that's in the tens place so it represents three tens or 30.

00:00:44.662 --> 00:00:47.350
And then we have 60,

00:00:47.355 --> 00:00:49.500
where did that come from?

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.100
Well, in the number 61,

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.788
the six is in the tens place,

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.841
so it represents six tens or 60.

00:00:55.841 --> 00:00:57.908
And then we have plus 90.

00:00:57.908 --> 00:01:00.381
Now where is 90 coming from?

00:01:00.381 --> 00:01:03.248
I don't see the obvious 90 over here.

00:01:03.248 --> 00:01:04.245
It might be tempting to say,

00:01:04.245 --> 00:01:06.243
well I have a nine over here,

00:01:06.243 --> 00:01:07.345
but this is in the ones place,

00:01:07.346 --> 00:01:08.809
it's not in the tens place.

00:01:08.809 --> 00:01:12.408
This is nine, not 90.

00:01:12.408 --> 00:01:13.725
And over here I have one.

00:01:13.725 --> 00:01:15.565
I definitely don't have a 90.

00:01:15.565 --> 00:01:17.307
Or I definitely don't even have a ten.

00:01:17.307 --> 00:01:18.142
So this would make sense,

00:01:18.142 --> 00:01:19.604
instead of, if this didn't say 90,

00:01:19.605 --> 00:01:21.680
if this said nine,

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.256
and instead of a ten,

00:01:22.256 --> 00:01:25.136
if this said one,

00:01:25.136 --> 00:01:26.901
'cause we have a one in the ones place,

00:01:26.901 --> 00:01:28.840
then it would make sense,

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.885
but it didn't say that.

00:01:28.885 --> 00:01:31.637
It didn't say 30 plus 60 plus nine plus one,

00:01:31.637 --> 00:01:33.773
It's saying 30 plus 60 plus 90 plus ten.

00:01:33.773 --> 00:01:36.710
So we're not gonna pick this choice.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:37.836
The next choice,

00:01:37.836 --> 00:01:40.111
we have 30 plus 60 plus nine plus one,

00:01:40.111 --> 00:01:41.771
which makes complete sense,

00:01:41.771 --> 00:01:45.799
because we have the

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.725
30 plus the nine,

00:01:49.725 --> 00:01:52.410
is going to be equal to 39.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.761
And then the 60 plus the one

00:01:56.761 --> 00:01:58.967
is going to be equal to 61.

00:01:58.967 --> 00:02:00.743
So these two things are equivalent.

00:02:00.743 --> 00:02:03.564
And the reason why it's useful to break up things this way,

00:02:03.564 --> 00:02:05.443
is 'cause you can compute in your head,

00:02:05.444 --> 00:02:06.140
30 plus 60,

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.789
that's three tens plus six tens is gonna be nine tens.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.501
So these two pieces right over here are going to be,

00:02:13.501 --> 00:02:14.939
that's going to be 90.

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:16.160
And then nine plus one,

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.646
that's gonna be ten.

00:02:17.646 --> 00:02:18.644
And then 90 plus ten,

00:02:18.645 --> 00:02:20.304
well that's going to be equal to 100.

00:02:20.304 --> 00:02:21.801
Now they didn't ask us to compute that,

00:02:21.801 --> 00:02:22.522
they're just saying,

00:02:22.522 --> 00:02:25.150
hey which of these are the same as what we have up above,

00:02:25.151 --> 00:02:27.549
and this one is definitely going to be the case.

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:28.895
And we can only pick one here,

00:02:28.895 --> 00:02:29.696
so we're done,

00:02:29.696 --> 00:02:31.855
but we can verify that this one isn't gonna be right.

00:02:31.855 --> 00:02:33.214
We have the nine plus one,

00:02:33.214 --> 00:02:35.454
then they have three and six.

00:02:35.454 --> 00:02:36.476
Now this three here,

00:02:36.476 --> 00:02:37.916
that doesn't represent just three,

00:02:37.916 --> 00:02:40.516
that's three tens, that's 30.

00:02:40.516 --> 00:02:41.816
This should be 30.

00:02:41.816 --> 00:02:43.314
And this is six tens,

00:02:43.314 --> 00:02:43.952
not just six,

00:02:43.952 --> 00:02:45.160
so that should be 60,

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.760
but that's not what they originally wrote.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.817
So we can rule that one out as well.

00:02:49.818 --> 00:02:51.440
Let's do another one.

00:02:51.651 --> 00:02:55.917
Which addition problem is the same as 41 plus 57?

00:02:55.917 --> 00:02:57.389
And here they broke up everything into,

00:02:57.389 --> 00:02:58.817
looks like tens and ones.

00:02:58.817 --> 00:03:00.234
So even before I look at the choices,

00:03:00.234 --> 00:03:02.254
let me see if I can do that.

00:03:02.254 --> 00:03:05.991
So 41, in the tens place I have four.

00:03:05.991 --> 00:03:09.195
So that's going to be four tens,

00:03:09.195 --> 00:03:11.390
and in the ones place I have one.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.909
Plus one one.

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:15.488
That's 41.

00:03:15.488 --> 00:03:17.635
And then 57,

00:03:17.635 --> 00:03:19.572
57 in the tens place,

00:03:19.573 --> 00:03:20.537
I have five,

00:03:20.537 --> 00:03:23.648
so plus five tens,

00:03:23.648 --> 00:03:25.890
and in the ones place I have seven.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.489
Plus seven ones.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.615
So let's see which of these choices is the same

00:03:30.615 --> 00:03:32.366
as what I just wrote here.

00:03:32.366 --> 00:03:33.737
So this first one,

00:03:33.737 --> 00:03:37.363
we have four tens

00:03:37.363 --> 00:03:38.603
and one one.

00:03:38.603 --> 00:03:40.608
Four tens and one one.

00:03:40.608 --> 00:03:42.163
Four tens and one one,

00:03:42.163 --> 00:03:44.103
that's 41, what I just...

00:03:44.103 --> 00:03:47.906
so this four tens plus one one would be 41.

00:03:47.906 --> 00:03:49.896
And then I also have,

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:54.376
five tens and seven ones.

00:03:54.377 --> 00:03:57.265
Five tens and seven ones.

00:03:57.265 --> 00:03:59.760
So this first choice is exactly what I wrote down,

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.465
it's just in a different order.

00:04:02.466 --> 00:04:03.209
If I write,

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.602
four tens plus five tens

00:04:04.602 --> 00:04:07.630
plus one one plus seven ones.

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:08.757
it's gonna be this first choice.

00:04:08.758 --> 00:04:10.128
And we know that we're done,

00:04:10.128 --> 00:04:11.903
but let's just look at the other choices

00:04:11.903 --> 00:04:13.518
to see why these don't make sense.

00:04:13.518 --> 00:04:16.107
So I see where the four tens come from,

00:04:16.107 --> 00:04:17.767
but then it has one ten.

00:04:17.767 --> 00:04:20.700
It looks like it's trying to take this one in a ones place

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:21.517
and somehow turn it into a one ten,

00:04:21.517 --> 00:04:23.165
so that's definitely gonna be wrong.

00:04:23.165 --> 00:04:24.766
And then it says five ones,

00:04:24.766 --> 00:04:26.717
somehow this is five tens here,

00:04:26.717 --> 00:04:27.866
not five ones.

00:04:27.867 --> 00:04:29.805
So that doesn't make sense.

00:04:29.805 --> 00:04:31.965
And then this one says four ones,

00:04:31.965 --> 00:04:32.626
well this four,

00:04:32.626 --> 00:04:33.659
this is in the tens place,

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:35.180
this is four tens.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.142
And then we have five ones,

00:04:37.142 --> 00:04:38.524
that five is in the tens place.

00:04:38.524 --> 00:04:39.917
It should be five tens.

00:04:39.917 --> 00:04:41.321
That should be tens,

00:04:41.322 --> 00:04:43.318
and that should be tens.

00:04:43.318 --> 00:04:46.447
So we feel good about the first choice.
