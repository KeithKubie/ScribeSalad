00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:05.070
- This program is a presentation of UCTV

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.193
for educational and
non-commercial use only.

00:00:11.302 --> 00:00:15.135
(funky music)

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.033
- Good afternoon.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.440
We're very pleased to have you here today.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.023
Thank you for joining us.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.050
My name is Ellen Gobler.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.990
I manage the graduate counsel lectures,

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.260
and it is my pleasure at this moment

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.623
to introduce Professor David Wake.

00:01:06.701 --> 00:01:09.701
(audience applause)

00:01:12.228 --> 00:01:14.070
- It's my privilege to introduce

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.440
the Hitchcock Lecturer today.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.960
As you see from your program,
the Hitchcock Lecturer

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.200
is one of the highest honors

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.610
that the Berkeley campus can bestow.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.110
And we've had a very
distinguished set of speakers.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.960
Our speaker today fits
very well in that company.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.270
I first met Neil Shubin

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.700
when he was a graduate student at Harvard,

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.910
preparing for what would be his major work

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.283
on the transition from water
to land in vertebrates.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.120
He was studying at that
time with Farish Jenkins

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.280
and with Pere Alberch and
was preparing a large,

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.330
essentially monograph-length review

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.393
of limb development in amphibians.

00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:02.567
This paper, which was
published with Pere Alberch,

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.880
became a very influential piece of work

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.650
and brought Neil to
the attention of people

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.530
in a number of fields beyond paleontology.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.310
So, for example, comparative anatomists,

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.460
developmental biologists,
people interested

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.040
in the then very new field of evo-devo,

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.930
took note of this work.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.440
And Neil has continued on this pathway

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.730
of integration since that time.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.730
He's well-trained in fields
such as geology and paleontology

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.880
where he's probably best known.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.290
But he also has done a lot
of, and continues to do,

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.600
a lot of work in developmental biology,

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.823
in particular in that
subfield known as evo-devo.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.080
In addition, he is a
comparative anatomist,

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.913
a naturalist.

00:02:51.913 --> 00:02:53.090
He's been in the field with me,

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.400
collecting salamanders,
more than one occasion.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.610
And is a person who's at home,

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.450
both in laboratory and field work.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.040
So I really think that, as an
integrative biologist myself,

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.910
that Neil Shubin exemplifies

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.003
what we mean by integrative biology.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.330
Neil came to Berkeley as a
Miller post-doctoral fellow,

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.520
and that's where our interaction began.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.962
And I must say,

00:03:20.962 --> 00:03:24.590
the most pleasant
15-period of collaboration

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.070
started at that point, and
we became good friends,

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.180
and I became a great admirer
of him and his work ethic

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.410
and the way he goes about
thinking about problems,

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:35.337
the way he sees problems,

00:03:35.337 --> 00:03:38.700
and the way he's able
to convey his enthusiasm

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.333
for his work to others.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.240
Following his successful Miller period,

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.570
he went to the University of Pennsylvania

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.010
where he started his
career on a very fast track

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.280
because he gained rapid attention

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.680
by his outstanding discoveries
in the fossil field,

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.840
and also, by his continued
work in evo-devo.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.510
In 2000, he worked, he moved
to the University of Chicago,

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.200
where he is now the
Robert Bensley Professor

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.210
of Organismic Biology and Anatomy.

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.860
And it's of great pleasure
to introduce you today,

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.840
introduce you today to Neil Shubin,

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.070
who will speak on Wings, Legs, and Fins:

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.790
How Do New Organs Arise in Evolution.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.136
Welcome.

00:04:22.136 --> 00:04:25.136
(audience applause)

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:28.713
- Thank you.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.230
Thanks again to the
Hitchcock Lecture Committee

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.580
for making this possible,
my return visit to Berkeley.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.350
It's a decided pleasure to be introduced

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.600
by my mentor and friend of
over 18 years, David Wake.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.420
The underlying theme of my two lectures

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.470
is really that most of
the major questions,

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:50.940
important questions in biology,

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.840
are solved by an integrative approach

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.670
that unites fields from
diverse disciplines.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.810
That what defines us are our questions.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.070
And that the tools we use
can span multiple fields.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.150
And this is nowhere more
true in evolutionary biology.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.530
In particular in those parts
of evolutionary biology

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.580
where we're trying to
reconstruct and understand

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:09.650
evolutionary history

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.000
Now, in stepping back a bit,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.750
really, when we think about
this being the Darwin year,

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.630
two great concepts really stem
from The Origin of Species

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.050
by Charles Darwin.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.680
I mean, the first is
obviously natural selection,

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.840
that there's a struggle for existence

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.970
that brings about a change
in populations over time.

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:31.270
The other, and the one that really

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.930
has captured my imagination,

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.090
is the notion of descent
with modification.

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.180
That it is just like we
are modified descendants

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.120
of our parents,

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.740
and understanding that
descent with modification

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.000
in our own family enables
us to see our family trees,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.090
that our family tree
extends to other species,

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.420
and our own species is
a modified descendant

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.110
of other species that had
existed in the distant past.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.870
And that through this process
of descent with modification,

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.970
the very simple beginnings can produce

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.660
an extraordinary evolutionary tree.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.890
And it's really that's what
I'm gonna focus on today.

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.260
Yesterday, the take-home message was,

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.250
those of you who were
awake for the last slide,

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.933
saw that evolutionary
trees are very important,

00:06:09.933 --> 00:06:12.610
that we can make very strong predictions

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.450
about where to find fossils

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.600
that answer major gaps in
our knowledge of evolution.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.460
And at the way we can best interpret them

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.080
is not as a linear series of
events, a ladder-like process,

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.350
but really is understanding
them as a branching tree

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.900
of diversity and adaptive
diversification and radiation.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.620
And so, to understand that,

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.130
we really kind of looked at the level

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:34.900
of whole animals yesterday.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.310
Today, we're gonna take
a sort of bore in a bit,

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.960
and look at organs, how
do new organs arise,

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.830
through change, through time.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.230
When you look at organs

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:45.660
with a principle of
descent with modification,

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:46.880
really becomes very clear

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.680
that to understand "the new" in evolution,

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.610
you have to understand the old.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.080
Because often what we
have to do is trace organs

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.260
through time to understand
what the same organ is

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.410
in different species over time,

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:00.900
To understand the sequence of changes

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.070
that happen in an organ from
one species to the next,

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.650
we have to find a way of
defining what the same is.

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:07.483
What's sameness?

00:07:07.483 --> 00:07:10.090
What's the same organ in
two different creatures?

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:13.480
So, to understand novelty
or new organs over time,

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.350
we really have to understand the old,

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:18.040
and that means understanding
what is the same structure

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.810
in different kinds of creatures.

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:21.730
Now, at first glance,
you could not imagine

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:23.510
a subject more boring or esoteric

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:24.570
than trying to come to grips

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:27.280
with what's the same in evolution.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.660
But I'm gonna tell you that it's actually,

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.300
arguably, one of the
most important concepts

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.500
in all of biology.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.080
And so much of what we do

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.600
as comparative biologists,
evolutionary biologists,

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.460
and even people interested
in biomedical discovery,

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:40.780
stems from that.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:42.100
And where to begin?

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.120
We begin with noses.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.860
So, here is a famous nose.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:50.470
This is Basil Rathbone
from Sherlock Holmes.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:51.600
And the question really is,

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.650
what is a nose in different species?

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:57.470
Is it the same as a nose in
some other kind of creature,

00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:58.580
like this creature here,

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:02.460
with this object perched at
the end of it? (chuckles)

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.950
Is it the same as this proboscis

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:06.120
at the end of this creature?

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.150
Is it the same organ in
these different species?

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:11.860
Is it the same as a bill of a bird,

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:15.420
of the giant proboscis of a paddlefish,

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:17.150
or the many different kinds of probosci

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.750
we find in arthropods and other creatures?

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:21.250
Are these the same structures?

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:22.360
How do we know it?

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.600
What does it mean in
biology to be the same?

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.190
This is the starting
point for understanding

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:29.887
how new features arise over time.

00:08:29.887 --> 00:08:31.790
Now, you can say, "Wow, that's
really kind of esoteric.

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:33.010
Thanks for getting into that."

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:34.070
But I will tell you

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:36.690
that it's arguably one of
the most important concepts

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:38.090
in biology, as I've said before.

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:41.090
And so much of what, that
exists of why it's important,

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:43.960
we take for granted, as
biomedical researchers.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.270
Look at the title of this paper.

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:49.700
Animal models of human disease:
zebrafish swim into view.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.440
Zebrafish and their
development are a model

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:55.210
for human blood formation,
formation of the pancreas,

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:57.020
and diabetes models, and so forth.

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:59.240
It's a model for biomedical discovery.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.780
Why stop at fish?

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:03.330
A Drosophila model for
Parkinson's disease.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:04.860
The only way to understanding that

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.410
is really understanding that
what the events we're seeing

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:09.480
in Drosophila are the same,

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.650
in this flying insect, in humans.

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:16.740
Indeed, if you ever need an example of why

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:20.080
evolutionary connections to
the rest of life on this planet

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.190
are important, I encourage
you to a website.

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:25.920
And that website is the
Nobel Prize in Medicine.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.370
And what you see here is a list

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:31.570
of the Nobel Prizes in Medicine
over the last few years.

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:33.320
Who've they gone to?

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.280
They've gone to people looking
at Drosophila, fruit fly,

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:37.960
to understand the genes that,

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.390
many of the genes that
control development.

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:42.460
Two Nobel Prizes in the last several years

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.470
have gone to people working
on a little tiny worm

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:47.130
the size of a comma on a piece of paper.

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:49.650
Yet, that little worm,
Caenorhabditis elegans,

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:53.900
is telling us how cells die,
kinds of programed cell death,

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.960
or how our genes are silenced.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.950
And indeed, it's discoveries such as that

00:09:57.950 --> 00:09:59.810
which have important ramifications

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:01.683
to drug design and human health.

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:04.460
Understanding the cell cycle has

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:07.190
depended on studies of creatures

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:09.780
as bizarre as sea urchins and yeast.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:10.613
And why stop there?

00:10:10.613 --> 00:10:14.590
Memory and sea slugs, although
not this particular one.

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:16.950
And of course, since
we have this individual

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:20.500
on the here, we also learn
about ourselves through corn.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.170
So, the important thing here is

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:26.690
by applying, understanding
basic biological discovery

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:28.050
and applying it to humans,

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:29.410
we really have to have an understanding

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:32.640
of what the same is in
different creatures.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.300
Now, like all important concepts,

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.760
this concept has deep,
deep historical roots.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.920
Natural philosophers, indeed,
philosophers for centuries

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.580
have been thinking very
hard about this question.

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.280
And one of the more prominent
players in this regard

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.730
is Sir Richard Owen, shown here.

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:50.350
This is Richard Owen. He's on your left.

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:53.070
And Owen was a (audience laughs)

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:56.830
Owen was an anatomist in the mid-1800's.

00:10:56.830 --> 00:10:58.830
And it was a wonderful
time to be an anatomist

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:01.780
because you could truly be
a comparative anatomist.

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:03.260
He was fortunate to be an anatomist

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.100
at a time new creatures
were being discovered,

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:06.280
whole new kinds.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.070
He named Dinosauria.

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:10.750
He originally described
the skeleton of a gorilla,

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:11.583
and so forth.

00:11:11.583 --> 00:11:14.260
He was uncovering great natural diversity.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.510
And in uncovering that
great natural diversity

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:18.330
of different kinds of
creatures and their skeletons

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:19.163
and so forth,

00:11:19.163 --> 00:11:22.460
he saw common plans, common designs.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.800
And this, when I was a graduate student,

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.970
this book, On the Nature of Limbs,

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:29.250
a discourse by Sir Richard Owen,

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:31.810
really caught my imagination
in a very big way.

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:33.520
Because it's in this
book where he lays out,

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.300
in a series of figures,
his notion of sameness.

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:37.610
And he had a couple
different notions here,

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:39.140
and it's worth spending
a little time on them

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:40.750
'cause we're gonna touch back to them

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:42.730
as we get into some experimental work

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:45.480
that's been happening in my lab lately.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.790
This figure. It's a beautiful figure.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:47.623
It's actually you fold it out.

00:11:47.623 --> 00:11:49.900
It's like ye big in the bind.

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:51.150
And he shows a human skeleton here.

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:52.970
And he defines several
different kinds of sameness,

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:55.660
and right off the bat, he's
laid off the human skeleton

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.420
with birds and other creatures,

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:59.030
and you could see he's colored it in

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:02.504
to make specific comparisons
of the same feature

00:12:02.504 --> 00:12:04.070
in different creatures.

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:07.460
You know, the vertebrae, the
appendages, and so forth.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:10.230
And this whole treatise
was really about limbs.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:13.120
And he sort of argued, like
many natural philosophers

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.970
at the time, for two
different kinds of sameness.

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:18.700
One is similar features
in different creatures.

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.010
And the other is similar
features in the same creature,

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:24.263
like arms and legs; they
have a similar sort of plan.

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:27.240
And you know, the basic
take-home message is

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:30.710
if you look at the arm of a
human, the wing of a bird,

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:33.180
or the limb of any limbed animal,

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:34.880
and you look at the skeleton inside of it,

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:38.200
there is a common structural
sort of theme or design,

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.860
which we have one bone going to two bones

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.620
going to series of small
bones of wrist or ankle bones

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:44.660
and then the digits.

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:46.610
You see that both in the leg and the arm,

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:48.680
and you see it in different species.

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.740
This frog arm here,
actually has two bones,

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.190
but they've been fused up.

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:55.460
So, the changes we see are
due to changes in the size

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:58.810
and shape and sometimes
loss of individual bones.

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:01.010
Now that sameness that
Richard Owen talked about here

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:03.830
is, between these
appendages, is very different

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:06.100
from that we see, say, a fly wing.

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.090
That this is somehow
a different structure.

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:10.760
It's not the same, even
though it's a wing,

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:13.250
just like a bird wing, but it's
composed of different bones.

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:16.150
It's essentially a different design.

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:18.200
Now, Owen was not an
evolutionary biologist.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.537
And so, just like I'm dancing
around the word history

00:13:20.537 --> 00:13:21.960
and evolution and so forth,

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.300
Owen spent this whole book
on the nature of limbs

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.820
dancing around the concept as well.

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:28.620
Now, this whole notion
was actually a hot topic

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:29.513
for a long time.

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.580
This pattern of similarity was identified

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.570
by people beginning in
the 1600's (mumbles).

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:40.540
One of the key players
here preceded Darwin

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:41.500
by several centuries.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:42.950
And this is Saint-Hilaire.

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:46.010
Saint-Hilaire was a natural
philosopher from France.

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:48.260
And he looked at the
same pattern, actually,

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.830
several decades before Owen.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:52.810
And he came up with a
really wonderful law,

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:55.990
a natural law, called
the Law of Connections.

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:57.720
And he was big into laws,

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.020
as a lot of his contemporaries were,

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:02.350
to try to understand
what are the regularities

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:04.400
behind the designs of bodies.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.660
And his Law of Connections was, basically,

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:09.680
that the way bones, the
pattern that bones articulate

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:12.010
with one another is highly conserved

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:13.146
among different creatures.

00:14:13.146 --> 00:14:16.030
That's the way you can define sameness.

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:18.740
And so, he identified this one
bone, two bone, little bone,

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:22.130
fingers design as a pattern of connections

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:24.450
that's essentially in variance, okay?

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:28.230
And that that is the design principle.

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:30.180
And he extended this throughout the body,

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:31.857
from the ears and the ear ossicles

00:14:31.857 --> 00:14:34.620
and ribs and the vertebrae and so forth.

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:35.860
Everything changed

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:37.580
Saint-Hilaire, Owen's ideas.

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:40.340
Everything changed with
Charles Darwin, obviously.

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:42.490
And Charles Darwin saw
this pattern as well,

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:43.860
and you know, he has this famous quote

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:44.693
from The Origin of Species,

00:14:44.693 --> 00:14:47.340
"What can be more curious
than the hand of a man,

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.850
formed for grasping, that
of a mole for digging,

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:51.910
the leg of a horse, the
paddle of the porpoise,

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:52.950
and the wing of the bat,

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:55.350
should all be constructed
on the same pattern."

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:57.400
And what struck Darwin was

00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:01.000
that despite significant variation...

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:06.210
despite significant variation
and function, right?

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:07.210
So you have wings.

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:08.050
You have flippers.

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:10.770
You have, sort of generalized
forelimbs of different kinds,

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:13.910
forelimbs for digging
and running and so forth.

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:17.280
That this one bone, two bone
pattern is sort of the template

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:18.713
for all this adaptation.

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:23.040
And it became clear to him
that the functional argument

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.730
for why you have have
this one bone, two bone,

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:27.590
little bone ray pattern is useless.

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:29.550
It really only makes sense

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:31.930
if these creatures evolved
from a common ancestor

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:34.430
that also had this one bone, two bone,

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:36.140
little bone ray plan as well.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:39.970
So, he explained this
concept that Owen was,

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:42.830
of sameness that Owen was
dancing around for years,

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:46.630
and Saint-Hilaire was trying
to develop laws of form for,

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:49.540
he explained it through
the principle of descent

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:50.573
with modification.

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:53.060
And that concept was really powerful

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:56.250
because what it does is it
enables us to make predictions.

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:59.590
That we could then say
that if this pattern,

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:01.580
one bone, two bone, and so forth,

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:04.500
has a history, we should see
that history in the rocks.

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.880
We should see that history
in comparative anatomy.

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.600
It should be written in the
bodies of other animals.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.290
And that's exactly what Darwin did.

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:13.410
And he said, you know,
well, I mean, he implied

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:14.800
that essentially you would see

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.610
that this pattern in other
creatures that don't have limbs.

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:18.760
What about the fins of fish?

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:21.990
I'm just showing you a
forelimb of a coelacanth here.

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:25.190
And indeed when you
layer it in, you see...

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:30.440
You see the skeleton.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.010
And again, it has the one bone,

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:34.130
but only doesn't have the
rest of the pattern as well.

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:35.910
You should see some, but
not all of that pattern

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:39.690
as you go deeper in the
evolutionary tree, if you will.

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:41.310
And it's those predictions
I've spent my time

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:43.770
as a paleontologist trying to look at,

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:45.240
to see the assembly of this pattern,

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:47.020
the one bone, two bone
pattern and so forth,

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:49.147
by finding fossils, looking
at genes and development,

00:16:49.147 --> 00:16:50.290
and so forth.

00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:54.720
And indeed, when you look at
Devonian Age limbed animals,

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.580
from about 365 million years ago.

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:58.140
This one's backwards, sorry about that.

00:16:58.140 --> 00:16:59.430
But you see the one bone, two bone,

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:02.380
little bone, finger program already set up

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:03.930
in the earliest limbed animals.

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:07.230
And as we look their finned
relatives in the fossil record,

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:09.410
things like Tiktaalik
and the other creatures

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:12.260
in the evolutionary tree,
more distant and so forth,

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.653
we begin to see the
assembly of this pattern.

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:18.340
So, here's a early limbed animal,

00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:20.770
and then you have the other
creatures on the tree,

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:23.470
each one further away or
more distantly related

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:25.290
to the limbed animals,

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:26.520
Where you see an early limbed animal here,

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:29.440
it has the one bone, two
bone, finger pattern.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.200
Tiktaalik has one bone, two bones,

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.320
has other more distal bones,

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:35.250
which we can actually compare
in some ways to this cohort.

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:37.870
And as you go deeper and
deeper and deeper in the tree,

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:39.830
what you still see is
this one bone, two bone,

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:43.410
little bone ray pattern
already set up in fish fins

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:46.290
doing a diversity of things
early in the radiation

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:49.383
of these kinds of fish,
in fins, with fin webbing.

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:53.880
And it turns out the
fossils are very useful

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.940
for us to understand
and trace this pattern

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:59.290
and its adaptive
diversity in the Devonian.

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:01.510
Things get less sure as we begin

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:04.340
to look at extant or recent fish.

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:06.610
So, here you have a fin of a lungfish.

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:10.050
Here you have fins of paddlefish
and sharks and so forth.

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:12.820
And when you see what
appears to be a very big gap

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:16.420
between extant limbs and extant fins,

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:19.810
although, as you get into
lungfish, no surprise,

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:21.330
you start to have one bone at the base,

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:22.800
just like all these other creatures,

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.690
as opposed to many bones at the base

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:27.693
like other fish more deeply,
more distant in the tree.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.830
So, we can actually begin
as comparative anatomists

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:33.150
and so forth, to begin
to really understand

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:37.030
what happens to the same
appendage in different creatures,

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:41.600
and for better and worse,
we can make some hypotheses

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.210
about what is the same bone
in different creatures.

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:45.790
This one bone is the same bone

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:47.030
in all these different creatures.

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:48.630
And then, it gets a little tenuous

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:50.510
as we go further out in the fin,

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:53.150
but we can still do this to
different degrees of accuracy

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:55.210
using different kinds of fossils.

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:56.230
Now, when we talk about sameness,

00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:57.589
I sort of want to introduce the concept,

00:18:57.589 --> 00:18:59.820
and I'm left with some no real analogies,

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:01.365
and so I just sort of made one up.

00:19:01.365 --> 00:19:05.680
(chuckles) When I was
thinking about this...

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.600
And when you think about,
you know, an organ,

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.770
an organ has parts, and then an organ

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:12.770
also has processes that make those parts.

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:14.780
So, you can think about the same thing

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:17.300
at many different sort
of hierarchical levels,

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:19.120
so that you can think about the model,

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:22.300
this sort of obnoxious
car here, a Hummer, right?

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:26.040
And you can trace the history
of the car, the Hummer,

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:29.160
over time from small sort of obnoxious car

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.410
to big obnoxious car

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:33.990
to sort of smaller
Recession-time obnoxious car.

00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:38.300
And then you can dissemble it
into its pieces, its parts,

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:39.530
which also have a history.

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:43.950
The tires have a history of
processes that are behind them.

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:46.850
The windshield, the lights,
the windshield wipers,

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:49.090
and so forth, all have histories.

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:51.007
So, you can think of the sameness

00:19:51.007 --> 00:19:54.090
and the history of the
whole entity, the car,

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:55.157
the Hummer in this case,

00:19:55.157 --> 00:19:56.757
and you can think of the sameness

00:19:56.757 --> 00:20:00.110
and the history of the parts
that make it up as well.

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:02.480
But you can also think of
the history of the processes

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.690
that make these parts, the vulcanization,

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:06.520
the processes behind
the making of the rubber

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.620
and the steel and so forth.

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:11.720
So, you can think about this
at many different levels,

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:14.380
and each level has explanatory power.

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:18.330
Indeed, a Hummer and
a Prius appear to have

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:20.730
very little in common, yet at the level

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:24.194
of the processes that make the car,

00:20:24.194 --> 00:20:25.940
the tires and so forth,

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:27.560
they share quite a bit.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.400
And so, essentially, I want
to look at organs in that way.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.920
I don't want to push the analogy too far

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.030
'cause like all analogies, it's limited.

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:36.410
But when you think about a
limb with a skeleton inside,

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:40.850
you can ask about the limb and
the history and the sameness

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:43.430
inside this organ, the
pattern of bones here,

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:47.420
Saint-Hilaire and Owen
and Darwin's pattern,

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:50.560
you can ask about its parts,
the bone and the cartilage,

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:52.360
and then you can also, on top of that,

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:57.330
ask about the sameness and
the history of the toolkit,

00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:00.050
of the biological recipe and processes

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:02.650
that build these structures
in different creatures.

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:05.550
And it's really kind of
linking these different levels

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:08.893
that we're gonna spend our
time today on in the talk.

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:13.440
So, I want to do is spend some
time on this toolkit issue.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.390
And to do that, we're really
gonna focus a little bit

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:17.860
on limb development, and how it arises.

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:19.200
You know, you think about development.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.210
It's one of the most wonderful
problems in all of biology.

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:24.060
You begin as a single-celled egg.

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:26.370
You end up as a two trillion cell adult.

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:27.580
Well, a nine trillion cell adult,

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:29.510
only two trillion of them are yours.

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:34.233
The other seven trillion are
microbes that inhabit you.

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.070
But over time, that one cell

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:40.320
becomes a very precisely packed organism

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.030
with the cells packed in the right way,

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:44.510
differentiated cells doing
their jobs in different ways.

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:48.210
And much of this development
is written inside the DNA

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:50.510
that exists within the egg

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:52.660
and its interaction with
the environment around it,

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:55.630
as well as the internal
environment in the embryo.

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:56.750
One of the outcomes of that is actually

00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:59.020
we can watch development
happen as things get bigger

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:01.730
and more complicated and
differentiated over time.

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:03.980
And the limb is no different.

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:06.930
So, limbs begin as little
pouches out the side of the body.

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:09.970
And over time, they grow out.

00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:11.840
And as they grow out and
extend out of the body,

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:13.607
it's called a limb bud at this stage,

00:22:13.607 --> 00:22:15.010
'cause it's a limb and it's a bud,

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:16.450
and it comes out of the body.

00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:18.520
And inside the limb bud cells go

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.410
from kind of looking all
alike to differentiating.

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:23.100
You start to see cartilage cells

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:24.840
and, eventually, muscle cells,

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:27.710
and the cartilage differentiating,
develops into bone,

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:28.790
and this good stuff.

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:31.700
And you could watch over time
the formation of the pattern

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:36.490
as the limb bud grows out.

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:39.460
Now, underneath this,
controlling this in many ways,

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:42.740
are a series of events that are
sort of written in the genes

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:43.720
if you will.

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.670
And here I have a limb bud

00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:47.730
showing you some of the
main signaling centers

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:49.260
that if you were to open a text book

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:51.520
in developmental biology,

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:52.920
or actually, introduction to biology

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:54.660
that you see, and this is a limb bud

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:56.310
with two patches of tissue

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:58.550
that are known as signaling
centers, more or less.

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:02.680
And what they do is, their
behavior actually promotes

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:05.210
and patterns the limb in many ways.

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:07.170
Now, there are factors
that exist in the body

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:09.140
that actually set these
things up initially,

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:10.280
early in development.

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:11.490
But then once they're set up,

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:13.420
they're really major properties

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:17.880
of how the appendage grows and
forms in early development.

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:21.210
And one thing that underlies
it, is a series of genes

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:23.740
that are turned on, and
we can actually map those

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:26.620
with a variety of techniques
to see their activity,

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:28.610
and look to see the chain of events

00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:33.450
by which these two
patches, the AER up here,

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:34.370
and the ZPA here,

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:39.190
I'm just gonna use their
abbreviations to talk about them.

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:41.230
And then there series
of genes that interact.

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:43.710
So, in the ZPA, there's a prominent gene

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:46.390
that marks ZPA activity
called Sonic hedgehog,

00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:48.190
here shown as SHH .

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:51.710
And in the AER, there
are genes known as FGF's.

00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:54.510
FGF8 is a real prominent one.

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:55.590
And let me just go into these,

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:57.030
and just talk a little bit about them

00:23:57.030 --> 00:23:59.740
'cause they're gonna be our
road map to look at sameness

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:03.780
in a variety of different
limbed and non-limbed animals.

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:05.040
So, if you look at a embryo.

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:06.190
Here's a embryo early in development.

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:07.310
It's a chick embryo,

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:10.860
and it's stained with one of
these called dyes, if you will,

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:12.670
and what it does, is
this is attached to FGF8.

00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:15.660
So it's a marker for the AER, okay?

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:16.767
And you could look at the AER here,

00:24:16.767 --> 00:24:20.130
and it's where this
gene FGF8 is turned on.

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:21.790
It's turned on no where
else in the fin bud,

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:23.080
that's signature of that.

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:25.210
And when you pop this
thing under a microscope,

00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:27.250
what you see is, it has a ridge there.

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:29.160
It's a ridge of tissue, and you see,

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:30.960
if you ever cut this as a section,

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.680
this is what that section would like.

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.410
And it's a thickened ridge of sort of

00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:37.150
epithelial-cut type cells separated

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:40.720
from sort of more disorganized
cells in the center.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.100
And it has special properties,

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:43.330
and those properties are really important

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:45.870
for our stor because
when it has a property

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:49.900
such that it seems to promote
the growth of the appendage,

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:53.020
so that if you remove the
AER early in development,

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:55.560
say at stage 18 here,
you're left with a limb

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.060
with only a humerus.

00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:59.530
If you remove the AER at
a slightly later stage,

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:02.980
say at stage 20, you're left with a limb

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:05.390
that has a humerus and
part of a radius and ulna.

00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:07.843
And so, you're left with
more at the later stage

00:25:07.843 --> 00:25:09.900
that you remove the AER.

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:12.310
It clearly promotes the
growth of the appendage

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:13.730
in a lot of ways.

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:15.500
And so, that's a stage-specific effect.

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:17.850
So, the AER is very
important in that regard.

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:20.820
There's another one, and that's the ZPA.

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:22.610
Remember we talked about the ZPA?

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:25.370
And it had that gene Sonic
hedgehog, the SHH gene.

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:27.540
This is another chick embryo,

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:28.383
and what you could see here is,

00:25:28.383 --> 00:25:30.930
here is a Sonic hedgehog
that's been stained there.

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:32.170
It's also been stained with FGF8,

00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:35.870
so you see the AER here,
and there's the ZPA.

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:37.310
Now, the ZPA seems to be involved

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:39.600
with a lot of events across the body.

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.360
In the appendage, it
also has a lot of events

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:43.760
that are associated with it.

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.060
But one of the real prominent
effects with the ZPA

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:49.620
and Sonic hedgehog lies
in the differentiation

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:51.470
of the digits, the fingers.

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:52.303
Because if you look,

00:25:52.303 --> 00:25:55.360
what you can do is you
can take the ZPA tissue,

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:56.780
you can dissect it out,

00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:59.980
and you can pop it on the
other side of the appendage.

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:02.540
When you do, you get a
very characteristic effect.

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:04.350
And you could also get the same effect

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:05.870
when you cause Sonic hedgehog,

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:07.870
the gene that is turned on here,

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:10.990
to be expressed on the
opposite side, ectopically,

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:12.810
misexpressed on the other side.

00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:15.300
So, you could do all this surgically,

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:17.540
or you can actually implant a bead

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:20.730
of a compound known as retinoic
acid, form of vitamin A,

00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:24.200
which will induce another patch
of Sonic hedgehog activity.

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.450
So, normal would only have
Sonic hedgehog in the ZPA,

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:28.230
which is the normal ZPA here,

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:32.380
but you can induce another
ZPA, an ectopic one,

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:34.110
through this bead of retinoic acid.

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:35.450
And voila, what you get?

00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:38.333
You get a mirror image
duplication of the fingers,

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:41.420
okay, in a variety of different species.

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:44.190
And if you knock down,
if you sort of inhibit

00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:47.260
Sonic hedgehog expression, or
take out the ZPA in some ways,

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:49.270
you reduce the number of fingers.

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:52.750
So it seems to be the
specification of the fingers

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:56.020
as you go from the
pinky to the thumb side.

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:58.920
It really depends on
the activity of the ZPA.

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:00.670
So, we really have these two centers,

00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:02.690
the AER and the ZPA,

00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:06.370
this is a good part of the
toolkit that builds appendages.

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:08.660
Now, why am I going into all this?

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:09.493
Good question.

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.080
Well, it's a useful question to ask,

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.720
given light of our Hummer
analogy I showed you earlier.

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.070
And that is the notion that,

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:17.940
what's the sameness of the toolkit?

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:19.330
We could trace the bones.

00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:20.830
What about the toolkit itself?

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:23.710
So, the idea here, what
we have to do here is

00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:26.330
to look at the toolkit,
the AER and the ZPA,

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:29.760
and ask the question, what
are they doing in fins?

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.723
And if we choose our creatures right,

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:34.147
we could begin to come to get,

00:27:34.147 --> 00:27:35.940
and these are the fins of these creatures,

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:39.580
and we do it along a
phylogenetic evolutionary tree,

00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:42.900
mapping with Chondrichthyans
here, sharks, skates, and rays,

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:44.900
Actinopterygns, which are ray-finned fish

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:48.160
like paddlefish and teleost and so forth,

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:49.570
and look at limbed animals.

00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:51.660
We could begin to ask the question is,

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:53.170
how ancient is the toolkit?

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:55.100
Is it the same thing in fins and limbs?

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:56.950
Is it doing similar kinds of things?

00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:58.970
Are genes doing the
similar kinds of things?

00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:00.620
And this is another way of asking

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:02.790
how these organs came about.

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:04.770
So, what we've been doing in
my lab is looking at fish,

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:06.490
and most lately, we've
been looking at sharks,

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:09.770
not Great Whites, but we've
been looking at skates, ratfish,

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:12.680
the three major groups:
skates, ratfish, and sharks.

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:14.630
It's a challenge working
with some of these creatures.

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:18.010
It's not like you can buy
shark embryos at the store.

00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:21.290
What we get them from is the
Shedd Aquarium in Chicago.

00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:23.650
We also get them from the
Marine Biological Laboratories

00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:24.650
in Wood's Hole,

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:27.600
what provides us a supply of
about 20 or 30 eggs a month.

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.840
Not a whole lot to do embryology on,

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.030
but enough for our purposes.

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:34.770
This all began, really, in my laboratory

00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:38.390
with a post-doc by the name of Randy Don.

00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:40.730
Randy worked on chicken eggs for his PhD,

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:42.180
looking at limb development.

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:43.330
And when he looked at shark eggs,

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:44.780
he saw that they looked
a lot like chickens.

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:47.200
So, we decided to all the
experiments he did on chickens,

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:49.350
only on sharks and skates.

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:50.820
So, this is a wonderful comparative test

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:52.100
to see how they lie together.

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:52.933
One of the things you'll see is

00:28:52.933 --> 00:28:55.300
every time I show a molecular
biologist from my lab,

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:57.850
in this talk, they're in the
field collecting fossils.

00:28:57.850 --> 00:28:59.450
So, I want you to know
that molecular biologists

00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:01.050
make very good fossil finders.

00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:03.333
So, there's hope for those
of you, you guys yet.

00:29:03.333 --> 00:29:06.670
(chuckles) Alright, sorry about that.

00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:08.730
Anyway so, you can ask questions.

00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:09.807
There's AER in limbs, here it is.

00:29:09.807 --> 00:29:11.300
And you can see the section here,

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:14.410
and here is the FGF8 expression.

00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:16.093
You look in shark fins,
and what you see is,

00:29:16.093 --> 00:29:18.120
in a skate in this case, Chondrichthyan,

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:22.339
there's the FGF8 expression,
and you also have an AER.

00:29:22.339 --> 00:29:23.172
And in fact, you have an AER,

00:29:23.172 --> 00:29:24.100
and it actually gets long

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:26.800
and turns into another
structure called a AEF,

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:29.640
which is related to fin formation.

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.110
So, it has the AER and that seems,

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:32.740
and it's also in all fish fins,

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:34.210
and so what you have is we can trace this

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:36.330
as the same structure all the way through.

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:37.163
Then what about the ZPA?

00:29:37.163 --> 00:29:38.840
'Cause you remember the ZPA has

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:40.860
this Sonic hedgehog expression here.

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:43.060
And when we misexpress
it with retinoic acid,

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:45.220
we get these duplicated structures.

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:47.980
So for this, we look at
the eggs of these things.

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:50.270
And so, here you see the yolk of a skate,

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:52.700
and there's the embryo on top of the yolk.

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:54.990
They develop inside an egg case.

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:57.490
Here's a shark, again with the embryo.

00:29:57.490 --> 00:29:59.210
And you can treat these things

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:02.617
by injecting retinoic acid.

00:30:02.617 --> 00:30:04.230
And this took a while to figure out,

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:05.470
of different concentrations,

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:07.500
into the egg at different stages,

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:08.560
and to see what it does.

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.320
Because in this chick what it'll do,

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:14.080
is induce that ectopic AER
with the Sonic expression,

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.920
and you'll get duplicated digits.

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:19.360
In sharks, here's the normal,

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:23.750
where you have the expression
of the Sonic hedgehog

00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:25.670
in the posteriorum margin of the fin.

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:26.680
Just like in a limb.

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:29.120
So, the expression, the activity
of the gene is the same.

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:31.010
And when you treat it
with this retinoic acid,

00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:33.300
you turn it on, you turn
it on all the way distally,

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.700
and then you also turn it on
on the anterior end as well.

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:40.000
So, you induce expression in novel places,

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.130
particularly in the anterior end.

00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:45.110
You can ask what the anatomical
readout of all this is.

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:47.030
Here's a dorsal fin, and
you can see a dorsal fin.

00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:48.800
This is the normal one, untreated.

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:51.260
And you could see it has, the
cartilage is stained blue,

00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:54.170
and you could see it has,
like, little stubs here.

00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:58.400
That's the axis of the fin, and
off of this come these rays.

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:00.710
When we treat it with retinoic
acid, more often than not,

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:03.240
we find, voila, a mirror
image duplication.

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.890
That is, you end up with
an axis here, an axis here,

00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:06.460
and rays coming off of either side.

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:09.230
And these axes can take, these
mirror-image duplications,

00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:10.840
can take different forms.

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:12.957
But again, in chicks
and in Chondrichthyans,

00:31:12.957 --> 00:31:15.513
and in not showing you, but
also in other kinds of fish,

00:31:15.513 --> 00:31:16.940
what do we find?

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:21.780
We find a great continuity of
big portions of the toolkit

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:23.880
that make fins and limbs.

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:26.770
AER, ZPA, and I'm not even
showing you all the other genes

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:30.380
in that cascade, that are
involved in this formation.

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:32.360
So, the beautiful thing here
is when we find it in a lot

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:34.320
of these groups here,
we could begin to say

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:37.180
that this genetic
toolkit is the same thing

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:38.580
in all these creatures,

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:40.870
and we can begin to say
that it was a property

00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:44.613
of the common ancestor of
all fish with appendages.

00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:48.160
Now, how do you begin
to approach the question

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.960
of comparing this to creatures

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.400
that don't have appendages at all?

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:53.749
So, appendages had to come into being

00:31:53.749 --> 00:31:57.120
at some point in evolutionary history.

00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:57.953
And for this, what we begin to use

00:31:57.953 --> 00:31:59.990
is one of Owen's notions,

00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:03.443
that is, to look at the
repeated parts in the body.

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:06.896
And this is Vesalius
showing the human skeleton,

00:32:06.896 --> 00:32:08.558
and what you see here is
a hindlimb and a forelimb.

00:32:08.558 --> 00:32:09.760
And you could see there's lots of

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:10.910
repeated parts in the body.

00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:11.970
There's repeated vertebrae.

00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:13.450
There's repeated ribs.

00:32:13.450 --> 00:32:16.800
There's repeated appendages
between forelimb and hindlimb.

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:19.650
Lots of repeated parts in the body.

00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:21.890
To Owen, this was really
significant because what he did,

00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:24.480
even though he wasn't an
evolutionary biologist,

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:26.860
what he did was he showed he had an idea

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:30.110
that all this diversity that
we see here in these bodies

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:32.530
with all these repeated parts

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:35.120
can be traced with something
he called an archetype,

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:38.130
which was a philosophical ideal.

00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:41.320
This little thing here that
does not exist in nature, okay?

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:44.360
But to Owen, it was the sort of thing

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:48.110
that all vertebrate animals
diversity is derived from.

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:51.640
It basically consisted of
a series of repeated parts,

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:54.910
of the vertebrae, and
the ribs, and so forth.

00:32:54.910 --> 00:32:57.540
And that the appendages
and the jaws and the heads

00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:00.210
all come about from the consolidation of

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:05.880
these repeated parts in different ways

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:07.570
to make different appendages.

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:09.860
This is a very attractive idea
to comparative anatomists,

00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:11.960
and actually to developmental
biologists as well.

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.440
Let's just take a peak at a fossil shark.

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:17.172
And I'll just show you how
we've been approaching it.

00:33:17.172 --> 00:33:19.180
And here's a shark known as Enneacanthus.

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:22.340
It's a fossil shark, and you
could see the appendages here,

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:25.120
and ribs and so forth.

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:27.350
And what really sort of
caught a lot of people's eye,

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:28.680
and I'll show you one of the people

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:32.120
who's very important in a
second, is this area here.

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:33.170
'Cause look at the repeated parts.

00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:34.570
Here is the gill skeleton.

00:33:34.570 --> 00:33:36.300
This is the upper and lower jaw.

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:37.740
And then you have the gill structures,

00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:39.380
and you see they form these little hoops.

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:41.790
And doesn't it seem, and
this is the shoulder here,

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:44.470
and the fin, doesn't it
seem like the shoulder

00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:47.382
is a repeated part of the gill structure,

00:33:47.382 --> 00:33:49.682
the structures that
support the gill skeleton?

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:54.840
The study of these gill arches

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:56.570
has been very, very, very important

00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:57.860
in understanding anatomy.

00:33:57.860 --> 00:33:59.620
'Cause what you see is, let's
just look at the front end

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:00.660
in these repeated structures.

00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:02.330
I'm not including the shoulder here.

00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:04.670
What you have is several
different gill arches.

00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:06.600
There's the first arch,
which is the jaw arch,

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:08.030
which I've colored in here,

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:09.810
which is the upper and lower jaws.

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:12.770
There's the second arch,
which is the hyoid arch,

00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:14.720
which consists of this
bone here and another bone.

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:15.570
This bone is very important.

00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:16.690
It's gonna appear later in the talk.

00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:19.130
So, remember, HM, hyoid mandibula.

00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:22.160
And then you have a series of
these arches, the gill arches,

00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:23.393
which support the gills.

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:25.730
This really captured the imagination

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:29.370
of comparative anatomists,
and most famous of these

00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:30.490
is Karl Gegenbaur,

00:34:30.490 --> 00:34:33.950
who is sort of the father of
comparative anatomy in Germany.

00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:35.580
And he came up with a notion

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:40.040
that basically held,

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:41.026
and this is the gill skeleton.

00:34:41.026 --> 00:34:42.810
This the mandibular arch.
This is that hyoid arch,

00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:44.230
and these are the gill arches here.

00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:48.140
He basically said is if you
compare these structures,

00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:52.730
the shoulder is the same
thing as these gill arches,

00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:55.980
and the appendage skeleton, the fin,

00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:59.020
is the same things as these rays in blue

00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:00.500
that extend from the gills.

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:02.510
And he proposed this gill-arch hypothesis

00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:03.770
that everybody laughed at.

00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:04.780
And it was basically the notion,

00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:05.620
he took it one step further.

00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:07.460
He says not only are these the same thing,

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:11.370
but that fins arose as
being modified gill arches.

00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:14.280
And it was a hypothesis that was almost,

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:17.063
quickly ignored after it appeared.

00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:23.010
Andrew Gillis is a graduate
student in my laboratory.

00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:24.460
And this is Andrew, again, in the field.

00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:27.140
He happens to be a very good
fossil collector as well.

00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:29.870
And he decided to look at this question,

00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:32.670
to ask the question, Gegenbaur's question,

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:36.720
the idea is, well, do the
gill arches have the toolkit?

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:38.510
Do they have the AER and the ZPA?

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:40.760
If so, what does that mean,
and how do we interpret it?

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:41.593
So, this is what it looks like.

00:35:41.593 --> 00:35:43.600
There's the gill skeleton
shown in textbook view.

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:44.940
This is the real world, (chuckles)

00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:47.093
so it's a lot harder to see.

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:49.600
But basically what you have
are the gill rays here.

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:51.930
See these gill rays shown in red?

00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:53.090
These are the gill rays themselves.

00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:56.503
So, this is what Gegenbaur
would compare as being fin,

00:35:57.870 --> 00:35:58.777
similar to the fins.

00:35:58.777 --> 00:36:00.260
That's the question is really

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:02.100
when we look at the
structures that pattern this,

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:03.930
do they have the AER and ZPA?

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:06.410
Do they have the toolkit
that makes appendages,

00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:08.240
aspects of the toolkit
that make appendages?

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.073
I mean, you dissect it out.

00:36:09.073 --> 00:36:09.910
It looks like something like this.

00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:11.770
You have the gill cartilages

00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:13.563
and the rays that extend from them.

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:16.420
So, let's look at the
AER. Here's a chick limb.

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:19.340
Again, there's the FGF
at the tip at the AER,

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:20.980
and there's what it looks like in section.

00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:23.760
Here's the skate fin that Randy,

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.860
I showed you from Randy's
work with the fold.

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:27.650
And when you look at the arches,

00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:30.770
what you see is we've
removed the gill arches here,

00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:31.710
so this is all damaged.

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:32.950
So, you have the stain in there.

00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:35.030
But here's the strip, right there.

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:37.230
And when you look at this
strip, it's stage-specific,

00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:39.030
so you'll see the arches in the front

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:40.680
in this particular preparation

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:42.460
are lighting up with the FGF8.

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:43.990
The ones in the back haven't lit up yet.

00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:45.680
But when you section them, what you find

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:50.340
is a very similar histology
at the tip as to the limb.

00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:51.820
Indeed, when you remove this AER,

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:55.780
it's the same stage-specific
truncation of development.

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:58.560
So, the AER seems to be
functioning in the same way

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:01.110
with a similar set of genes,
which I'm not showing you,

00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:02.490
I'm just showing you one,

00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:06.173
in sharks, shark gills,
and shark appendages.

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:10.330
Again, to ask the ZPA is a Sonic express.

00:37:10.330 --> 00:37:12.220
So here's Sonic hedgehog as it turned on

00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:14.180
in the posterior portion of the appendage.

00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:15.280
Here it is in the chicken.

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:16.800
Here it is in the skate.

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.590
And when you look at the arches,

00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:20.480
what you see here is the fin,

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:22.150
and there's the Sonic,

00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:24.150
its activity turned on
in the posterior portion.

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:25.430
And here it is in the arches.

00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:27.880
All limited to the posterior,

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:30.700
or rear portion of each gill arch,

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:33.100
right at the area where
the gill rays will form.

00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:35.380
And then we looked at other things

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:36.860
like the receptor for it and so forth.

00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:38.380
So, there's parts of this cascade

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:41.580
I'm just sort of taking the
top level comparison here.

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:43.500
The question then becomes, is
let's treat it like a limb.

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:44.370
If you treat it with RA,

00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:48.160
do you get this other patch
of Sonic hedgehog turned on.

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:50.210
So you inject these
things with retinoic acid

00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:53.480
using the same treatments, and boom.

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:55.080
What you see here is the normal,

00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:57.940
looking at side-on view of the arches.

00:37:57.940 --> 00:37:59.410
And here you see the Sonic hedgehog.

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:01.450
And then you see a stage-specific effect.

00:38:01.450 --> 00:38:03.730
This is a gill ray that's in face,

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:06.010
but it's induced on another patch

00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:08.120
of expression in this particular arch,

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:09.420
on the other side .

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:10.600
Okay, and it's stage-specific.

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:12.560
So, this one's still showing it lightly.

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:14.390
If I was to do it slightly
later in development,

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:18.660
this thing would go off, and
you'd see it here in deeper,

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:19.573
as deeper stain.

00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:21.620
The question then becomes

00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:23.553
what is the anatomical readout of this?

00:38:23.553 --> 00:38:26.290
And so you have, it's
behaving in the same way.

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:27.123
So, here's a chick limb.

00:38:27.123 --> 00:38:29.020
Here's one when you treat
it with retinoic acid.

00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:32.860
Again, you induce another ZPA,
a Sonic hedgehog expression.

00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:35.240
And what you see is here is the normal,

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:37.520
and then in the treated ones,

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:40.040
you find rays branching
out in the opposite side.

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:44.770
For all intents and purposes,
being a mirror duplication.

00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:46.070
And we can dissect these things out,

00:38:46.070 --> 00:38:49.597
and characterize what these
duplicated rays look like.

00:38:49.597 --> 00:38:50.480
And for all the world,

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:52.770
it looks like they're coming
out in the opposite side

00:38:52.770 --> 00:38:53.870
of the gill cartilage.

00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:57.160
And this gets even more exquisite
as we look in more detail.

00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:00.450
There's a relationship
between the AER and the ZPA,

00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:01.850
between the genes in them,

00:39:01.850 --> 00:39:03.990
the Sonic hedgehog and FGF8.

00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:05.237
There's all sorts of intermediary genes

00:39:05.237 --> 00:39:06.880
and a feedback loop between them.

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:08.650
And that feedback loop and all those genes

00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:12.650
are present doing similar
things in the gills,

00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:16.250
and in the gill rays,
and in the appendages.

00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:19.080
So, it really seems at
a developmental level,

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:23.090
that the toolkit that's used
to pattern an appendage,

00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:24.960
the fin, in this case, of a shark,

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:27.220
is the same toolkit, is the same thing

00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:28.910
as this pattern in the gill rays.

00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:30.690
This is a developmental extension,

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:33.473
a sort of level of the
mechanisms that make anatomy,

00:39:34.333 --> 00:39:36.660
of Gegenbaur's theory.

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:38.419
Question really comes
down to how would you know

00:39:38.419 --> 00:39:40.390
if gills actually were transformed

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:41.660
into these things over time.

00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:43.660
And what we need here are fossils.

00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:45.390
And this is where fossils would tell us

00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:48.650
the sequence of stages in
the transformation, perhaps,

00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:50.300
of gills to rays.

00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:52.490
Right now, what we know is
if you look at jawless fish,

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:55.640
which don't have appendages,
but have these gill rays.

00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:57.400
Okay, they have a full set of rays

00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:59.723
that are sure very large
in the posterior end.

00:39:59.723 --> 00:40:01.960
They're very well developed.

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:04.280
Ideally, what we'd like to
find is intermediate stages

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:05.830
in this process in the fossil record.

00:40:05.830 --> 00:40:08.310
And all someone has to do
is target Silurian age rocks

00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:10.023
to test their hypothesis.

00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:14.506
The other thing about
these gill cartilages

00:40:14.506 --> 00:40:16.670
is they are wonderful for anatomy.

00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:17.930
Here you see the arches again.

00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:20.430
It's the upper jaw and lower jaw.

00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:21.263
It's first arch.

00:40:21.263 --> 00:40:23.690
Here's the hyoid arch with
the hyoid mandibular there,

00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:25.550
and the gill cartilages.

00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:27.680
They all develop within the swellings,

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:29.500
the branchial arches that develop

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:30.650
in the front end of the embryo.

00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:32.150
Here's the pair of eyes.

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:33.500
And you see there's a pair of arches here

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:34.670
that we colored in.

00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:37.290
If you follow the fates of
the cells that are in there,

00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:39.600
and these cells come
from a variety of places

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:41.540
as well as develop in situ.

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:44.910
These cells differentiate
into respective structures

00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:46.310
in the arch.

00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:49.280
You can look at any creature
that has a head, take a human,

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.910
and you see these same branchial arches

00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:54.060
with this first pair, second
pair, third pair, and so forth.

00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:56.360
What happens in a human with these arches,

00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:57.550
they become portions of,

00:40:57.550 --> 00:41:00.170
the first arch becomes a
portion of the lower jaw

00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:02.490
and two bones of our middle ear.

00:41:02.490 --> 00:41:05.670
The second arch becomes a
bone that supports the throat

00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:07.970
and one bone in the middle ear.

00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:10.870
And the others become
portions of the voice box.

00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:13.510
The take-home message here
is that developmentally

00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:15.900
the bones that you're using,

00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:17.140
many of the bones and muscles and nerves

00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:18.727
that your using to hear me with right now,

00:41:18.727 --> 00:41:20.530
and many of the bones
and muscles and nerves,

00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:22.830
or some of them, that I'm using
to talk to with right now,

00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:27.020
correspond to gill structures
developmentally in fish.

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:28.130
Now, what's interesting about this story,

00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:30.430
and this shows the importance
of integrative biology

00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:32.770
and understanding descent
with modification is,

00:41:32.770 --> 00:41:34.650
okay, you see this in development,

00:41:34.650 --> 00:41:37.380
but in paleontology and the fossil record,

00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:39.380
what I should see is a transformation

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:43.050
of jaw bones into middle ear bones,

00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:45.420
and a transformation
of a second arch bone,

00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:49.690
namely this hyoid
mandibula into an ear bone.

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:51.290
And guess what we see.

00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:53.400
When we look at the fossil
record in comparative anatomy,

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:57.260
what we see is the hyoid
mandibula, the hyoid arch gill bone

00:41:57.260 --> 00:41:59.580
over time it gets smaller
and smaller and smaller,

00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:02.290
such were in Tiktaalik,
which I'm not showing here.

00:42:02.290 --> 00:42:03.620
It's intermediate in condition,

00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:05.850
and then it gradually
shrinks to go into the ear

00:42:05.850 --> 00:42:07.770
to become the stapes.

00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:10.290
Fossils and embryos
showing the same story.

00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:14.390
And what about those jaw bones
that go into the middle ear?

00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:15.223
Same thing.

00:42:15.223 --> 00:42:17.280
If you look at the jaw of
things we call reptiles,

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:19.020
which have multiple bones in the jaws,

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:21.020
you can trace two of
these ones in the back.

00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:22.410
They get smaller and smaller and smaller

00:42:22.410 --> 00:42:25.480
'til they translate into the middle ear.

00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:28.130
So, development and fossils are showing us

00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:29.800
the same thing in the ear.

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:31.370
And it's also showing us
something very important

00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:33.100
about descent with modification

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:36.466
because the same things
in different creatures,

00:42:36.466 --> 00:42:39.180
if descent with modification is acting,

00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:41.600
the same thing doesn't have
to look like, look like it.

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:44.110
That is, these middle ear
bones, this stapes here,

00:42:44.110 --> 00:42:46.530
looks nothing like the
hyoid mandibula of a shark.

00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:49.270
Yet it's the same thing
in different creatures.

00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:51.530
These two bones here,
the malleus and incus,

00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:53.070
look nothing like the two bones

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:56.040
in the back end of one of these jaws.

00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:58.970
Yet it's the same thing
in an evolutionary sense.

00:42:58.970 --> 00:43:01.070
And that's the power of
descent with modification

00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:03.550
because over time, with small changes,

00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:05.150
you can get great differences.

00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:06.590
And we can pick those differences up

00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:08.940
when we look at embryos
and we look at fossils.

00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:12.850
So, the take-home message to
much of what I've been saying

00:43:12.850 --> 00:43:15.800
is that similar biological
recipes make different organs,

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:18.483
whether it's gills, rays, and appendages.

00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:21.750
And I'll show you some other cases.

00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:23.290
But the important thing,
in terms of thinking

00:43:23.290 --> 00:43:25.930
about descent with modification
at the level of recipes

00:43:25.930 --> 00:43:29.190
or toolkits or mechanisms
that make bodies,

00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:30.800
is that new organs can come about

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:33.490
by the modification of ancient recipes.

00:43:33.490 --> 00:43:35.160
Just like we have
descent with modification

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:36.290
and we can interpret it

00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:38.680
at the level of anatomical structures,

00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:40.420
we can have descent with modification

00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:41.880
at the level of the toolkit,

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:43.980
the processes, and the genes that compose

00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:47.023
that toolkit that make organs.

00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:51.810
And so, this allows us to
return to Owen's theme, really,

00:43:51.810 --> 00:43:53.790
in the sense that he
was saying, basically,

00:43:53.790 --> 00:43:57.620
that these appendages are the same thing,

00:43:57.620 --> 00:43:58.550
but they're utterly different

00:43:58.550 --> 00:44:00.920
from something like this,
which is the wing of a fly.

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:02.550
And indeed, when we look at Darwin

00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:04.740
and we follow descent with modification,

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:07.330
that appears to be correct
in an evolutionary sense,

00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:11.400
is that fly wings have a
separate evolutionary origin

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:14.543
than do the appendages
of vertebrate animals.

00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:20.020
But when we start to look at
the toolkit and the recipe,

00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:22.350
this convenient distinction

00:44:22.350 --> 00:44:24.443
begins to break down in an odd way.

00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:27.850
So, let's look at a fly leg or wing,

00:44:27.850 --> 00:44:30.240
I have it on the left,
and a limb bud here.

00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:31.760
And what's interesting,
if you can think about,

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:33.530
and I'm just gonna do an overview of it,

00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:37.200
the biological processes
that determine the pattern

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:39.480
of these appendages in three dimensions,

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:43.590
that along this z-axis, the
y-axis, and the x-axis here,

00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:46.580
let's look at the tools that pattern that.

00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:49.710
Well, we already talk about
some of these in the limb.

00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:52.220
And I'm just showing a drawing here,

00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:54.290
which shows if you look at the x-axis,

00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:56.520
it's really the ZPA with Sonic hedgehog,

00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:59.570
and there's another gene which
I didn't talk about, BMP.

00:44:59.570 --> 00:45:01.330
If you look at a fly imaginal disc,

00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:02.900
which looks nothing
like a limb bud at all,

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:05.400
or the imaginal disc of a wing or a leg,

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:07.750
they have a hedgehog gene
that's evolutionarily related

00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:09.710
to Sonic hedgehog, and it is turned on

00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:12.552
in the entire sort of posterior half

00:45:12.552 --> 00:45:16.900
of the developing fly imaginal disc.

00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:18.090
And there's another gene, DPP,

00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:21.090
which is turned on just
along the margin here,

00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:24.220
and that, by the way,
is the same gene as BMP,

00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:28.920
if you could trace it in
evolutionary trees of genes.

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:31.790
What happens when you misexpress
Sonic on the opposite side,

00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:33.720
you remember, we showed
that to you a million times,

00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:38.440
you get a duplicated
fin, or duplicated limb.

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:40.730
What happens if you misexpress hedgehog,

00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:41.850
its equivalent in the fly,

00:45:41.850 --> 00:45:45.610
wing imaginal disc on the
opposite side, or even this DPP.

00:45:45.610 --> 00:45:46.460
What do you find?

00:45:47.570 --> 00:45:48.920
You find a duplicated wing.

00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:51.640
Okay, these are differently
derived structures,

00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:55.990
but you find duplicate,
same effect, same genes,

00:45:55.990 --> 00:45:58.840
evolutionarily doing similar
kinds of things, equivalent.

00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:00.200
And I can say the same thing

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:01.800
for genes that are on the y-axis,

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:02.710
which I'm not gonna get into.

00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:05.980
You have genes like wingless,
which I didn't draw, apterous.

00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:06.813
And here you have genes

00:46:06.813 --> 00:46:09.020
that are wingless as here, too, in LMX1.

00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:12.220
And you also have in the x-axis,
the axis which grows out.

00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:15.290
You have other genes which control the...

00:46:15.290 --> 00:46:17.360
which are within the AER but actually

00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:20.420
are also controlling the
outgrowth of the thing.

00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:23.743
DLX here in distalis, in the
fly leg, but not in the wing.

00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:25.433
So really, if you look at it,

00:46:25.433 --> 00:46:27.190
and just the take-home message is

00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:29.140
here you have two organs,
which by all accounts,

00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:33.060
are different, okay, in
an evolutionary sense.

00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:37.440
Yet the toolkit, the underlying
toolkit that makes them

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:39.840
is actually looks to be very similar,

00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:43.060
so similar in many ways
that it may be the same

00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:44.300
in an evolutionary sense,

00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:46.300
that it's continuous in doing something.

00:46:47.170 --> 00:46:48.480
This leads me to sort of the final

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:50.280
sort of sequence of the talk,

00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:52.150
which is to really think
about what this means

00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:54.600
with regard to the origin of organs.

00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:57.990
And there was a analogy, a flawed analogy,

00:46:57.990 --> 00:46:59.830
but an analogy that was very powerful,

00:46:59.830 --> 00:47:03.180
that was set up by Francois Jacob in 1977.

00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:05.510
It's the notion of tinkering.

00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:07.330
He took a very teleological
view of evolution,

00:47:07.330 --> 00:47:08.500
so let's just ignore that for a second.

00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:13.350
But he had an analogy that
has some intuitive power.

00:47:13.350 --> 00:47:15.700
And that is what he says
is evolution doesn't act

00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:18.590
as an engineer who can build
structures from scratch.

00:47:18.590 --> 00:47:21.800
In his mind, evolution
acted as a tinkerer,

00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:23.910
modifying existed odds and ends,

00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:26.300
things that exist to make the new.

00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:28.000
Now, put in non-teleological terms,

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.760
what it means is that
the fuel for evolution,

00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:34.700
the variation that natural
selection actually acts on

00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:36.520
is really the result of changes

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:39.280
to the existing genetic
structure in an organism,

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:41.150
genetic and developmental
structure in an organism.

00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:42.980
It acts on what exists at every stage.

00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:45.107
And what exists in every
stage are the genes

00:47:45.107 --> 00:47:48.000
and developmental processes,
indeed, much of the toolkit

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.263
that's making the organs
of ancestral forms.

00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:53.710
So, this leads me to sort of think about

00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:58.120
when I look at cladograms,
I think of something as,

00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:02.500
how when we deploy this
notion of the Hummer analogy,

00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:05.650
being able to trace the
structure of organs in one way,

00:48:05.650 --> 00:48:07.490
but also the toolkits that pattern them

00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:09.240
and aspects of those toolkits.

00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:11.420
It makes one think of almost
a biological cut and paste,

00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:13.147
and not as much as the Wall Drug Jackalope

00:48:13.147 --> 00:48:15.780
or the Wisconsin Narrows Basscat,

00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:18.160
but it leads to several different notions.

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:20.440
The first is versions of the same toolkit

00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:22.010
pattern different organs.

00:48:22.010 --> 00:48:23.930
Obviously, we've seen
that with the fly wings

00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:25.800
and the limbs of vertebrates.

00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:29.810
We've seen that in fins and gill arches.

00:48:29.810 --> 00:48:31.670
That ancient tools can be redeployed

00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:32.850
during the origins of new organs.

00:48:32.850 --> 00:48:34.100
That may have been the case

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:36.580
in the origin of appendages themselves

00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:38.560
from, perhaps, the gill arches

00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:42.790
of unfinned ancestors.

00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:44.320
And finally, and this is something

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:46.570
that my introducer, David Wake,

00:48:46.570 --> 00:48:48.210
has talked about for a long time,

00:48:48.210 --> 00:48:51.410
that is having a common
toolkit, having common processes

00:48:51.410 --> 00:48:54.790
that build bodies makes
the independent evolution

00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:58.423
of similar structures more
likely rather than less likely.

00:49:01.010 --> 00:49:04.240
Nobody's really read Stephen
J. Gould's final tome,

00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:07.760
'cause it's about 1,700
pages, but I actually did.

00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:10.380
I was one of the students
who worked with him.

00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:15.090
He devoted 200 pages, more than
200 pages of his final book

00:49:15.090 --> 00:49:17.800
to looking at the consequences
of conserved genes

00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:20.100
on parallel evolution.

00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:22.130
And I really think he put his finger

00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:24.310
on something that's very important.

00:49:24.310 --> 00:49:27.690
That the independent evolution
of similar structures

00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:29.740
is something that's
gonna be made more common

00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:32.980
rather than less common by
the unity of the toolkit

00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:36.100
that we see in diverse kinds of creatures.

00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:39.580
And this sort of allows us to
return to our opening nose.

00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:42.150
And that basically answering the question

00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:44.040
that we can look at the
nose, and we can say,

00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:46.757
quite confidently, looking at phylogeny,

00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:49.500
evolutionary history, we can say

00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:52.220
that the sort of the
nasal organ of mammals

00:49:52.220 --> 00:49:54.690
is the same thing at the level of organs.

00:49:54.690 --> 00:49:57.540
Scientists are still undecided
about this particular one.

00:49:58.988 --> 00:50:01.370
But yet it's not the
same thing as an organ

00:50:01.370 --> 00:50:02.203
in an evolutionary sense.

00:50:02.203 --> 00:50:04.170
This is the beak of a bird,

00:50:04.170 --> 00:50:06.070
and the proboscis of a paddlefish,

00:50:06.070 --> 00:50:07.750
and the proboscis of a beetle.

00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:10.500
Yet despite that, as these things grow,

00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:13.360
as these things develop, they
use the same general tools

00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:16.223
to form their structures inside.

00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:19.260
So, I wanna close with the same series,

00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:20.643
the same sequence of
things I talked yesterday,

00:50:20.643 --> 00:50:23.322
and that's the power
of thinking with trees.

00:50:23.322 --> 00:50:27.100
We tend, I tend even, when I'm presenting

00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:28.660
to think evolution and present evolution

00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:31.840
as a linear series of
events, a gradual series

00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:34.420
that happens within one species,

00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:36.650
with one set of organs
changes into another species

00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:38.630
with another set of organs, and so forth.

00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:41.060
But we really need to return
to Darwin's original vision,

00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:42.980
of which his actual original
vision is right here,

00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:45.210
which is his notebook with his first tree,

00:50:45.210 --> 00:50:47.190
which is, I think here,

00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:48.840
to the notion of a tree.

00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:50.190
Because the notion of a cut and paste

00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:51.530
becomes quite powerful.

00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:53.570
Because the diversification of creatures

00:50:53.570 --> 00:50:55.820
and their evolutionary development

00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:59.010
of their evolutionary
diversity from one another,

00:50:59.010 --> 00:51:00.980
from their common ancestors.

00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:04.900
As changes happen genetically
within different populations,

00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:07.050
it will be more likely
rather than less likely

00:51:07.050 --> 00:51:09.480
to see similar kinds of
anatomical structures

00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:10.880
arise in different creatures.

00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:14.500
Often times, what we'll
see is whole modules,

00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:18.130
whole assemblages of the
toolkit that makes bodies

00:51:18.130 --> 00:51:20.050
redeployed and turned on in ways

00:51:20.050 --> 00:51:22.060
to make all kinds of new structures.

00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:23.590
And I'd like to close just with a thought

00:51:23.590 --> 00:51:26.370
in integration and in integrative biology,

00:51:26.370 --> 00:51:27.540
and I think in this context,

00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:31.420
we really have a power
to integrative biology.

00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:33.370
Because to understand
the origin of new organs,

00:51:33.370 --> 00:51:36.370
we have new tools, and it's
really how we use those tools

00:51:36.370 --> 00:51:39.890
to answer our questions that
it's so vitally important.

00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:42.370
And we have fossils to
tell us about the sequence

00:51:42.370 --> 00:51:46.400
of anatomical changes that
exist in ancestral states.

00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:50.210
We have embryology to tell
us about how cells interact

00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:51.710
to build organs.

00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:53.570
And now, we have at our disposal,

00:51:53.570 --> 00:51:55.550
understanding of genomes and genomics

00:51:55.550 --> 00:51:57.390
to understand the regulatory elements,

00:51:57.390 --> 00:51:59.430
the elements, the little pieces of DNA,

00:51:59.430 --> 00:52:02.280
and the pieces that bid
to those pieces of DNA

00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:04.540
that actually control developmental events

00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:06.000
in different creatures.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.410
Because it's not trivial at all

00:52:07.410 --> 00:52:10.260
if we can link genomics,
fossils, and embryos

00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:12.450
to understand how whole new toolkits

00:52:12.450 --> 00:52:14.590
can be redeployed to make whole new ways

00:52:14.590 --> 00:52:18.540
of living in an ecosystem.

00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:20.210
I'd like to thank, and to close again,

00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:23.580
by thanking my host here at
Berkeley for a marvelous week.

00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:25.100
I'd like to thank you for
being such a great audience.

00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:25.974
Thank you very much.

00:52:25.974 --> 00:52:28.974
(audience applause)

00:52:33.331 --> 00:52:35.480
- [Woman] Can you comment a little bit

00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:39.110
on how far back, in terms of, for example,

00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:41.290
going back into microbes

00:52:41.290 --> 00:52:44.240
some of those developmental genes go?

00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:48.900
- Oh, sure. If you look
at the way cells interact

00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:52.340
with their environment, and
the way that information

00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:55.910
from outside a cell is
translated to inside a cell,

00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:59.270
which is such an important
part of building bodies,

00:52:59.270 --> 00:53:01.750
such an important part of
interacting with the environment,

00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:05.040
virtually all that apparatus
in some way, shape, or form

00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:06.890
can be originally traced to microbes.

00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:10.250
So to really understand, like Nicole King,

00:53:10.250 --> 00:53:11.390
who's here at Berkeley,

00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:13.140
to understand the origin
of bodies themselves,

00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:14.420
you really have to understand microbes,

00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:17.350
'cause that's where many
of these mechanisms first

00:53:19.083 --> 00:53:22.120
arise as microbes are doing
their jobs being microbes,

00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:23.470
interacting with the world.

00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:25.613
- [Man With Accent] Over the journey

00:53:25.613 --> 00:53:30.470
of your fossil discovery or finding,

00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:32.110
have you find any...

00:53:34.810 --> 00:53:37.450
vertebrate animals

00:53:37.450 --> 00:53:40.130
that have more than four sets of limbs,

00:53:40.130 --> 00:53:41.593
like six limbs?

00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:45.020
- No, I haven't, but they exist.

00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:47.290
And so, if you look at, it
depends what you call a limb,

00:53:47.290 --> 00:53:50.870
if you look at some sort
of, many of these things

00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:52.560
called spiny sharks, what you find is

00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:54.940
they can have multiple
sets of paired appendages.

00:53:54.940 --> 00:53:57.160
Whether they're the same thing
as the true-paired appendages

00:53:57.160 --> 00:53:58.770
that we have, I don't know.

00:53:58.770 --> 00:54:00.960
But these are very sort of basal fish,

00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:02.610
and they have multiple sets and eggs.

00:54:02.610 --> 00:54:05.460
- [Man With Accent] You think
if there is any explanation

00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:09.920
of why we don't see any creature
with more than four limbs?

00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:11.180
- We'll you see it.

00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:14.520
So, like, the whole,
remember, multi-legged frogs?

00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:15.870
Where frogs would develop with...

00:54:15.870 --> 00:54:18.093
- [Man With Accent] Or
something like grackons?

00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:21.730
- Right, so you actually see mutations

00:54:21.730 --> 00:54:23.250
or you see perturbations in development

00:54:23.250 --> 00:54:24.683
that can produce a
creature with lots of legs.

00:54:24.683 --> 00:54:25.516
The problem is, they can't get around.

00:54:25.516 --> 00:54:28.100
They can't walk. Those are
not typically innervated,

00:54:28.100 --> 00:54:29.200
and they're not coordinated

00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:30.760
within the central nervous system.

00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:33.020
So, you can have a limb,
but you may not have a limb

00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:36.000
that can be functional
because it's not part of,

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.950
wired into the central nervous
system in any effective way.

00:54:40.220 --> 00:54:41.830
Often times, they're just
dragging these things along,

00:54:41.830 --> 00:54:44.910
and it's a liability, as
the outcome of predation.

00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:45.743
But that's in vertebrates.

00:54:45.743 --> 00:54:47.190
I don't know what
happening in invertebrates.

00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:51.208
I just know the frog world. (chuckles)

00:54:51.208 --> 00:54:53.590
- [Man In Plaid Shirt] Professor,
so you showed the pictures

00:54:53.590 --> 00:54:58.210
of the gills structures and the jaw bone

00:54:58.210 --> 00:55:00.730
and the ear bone in humans.

00:55:00.730 --> 00:55:02.280
So, with what degree of certainty,

00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:04.080
can you make these sort of connections

00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:05.890
when you do this kind of study?

00:55:05.890 --> 00:55:08.080
- Yeah, I mean, one of the
the things I gotta tell you

00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:10.460
that absolutely blew me
away when I was a student

00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:13.100
was seeing the transformation of jaw bones

00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:15.210
to ear bones in the fossil record,

00:55:15.210 --> 00:55:16.290
in the mammal-like reptiles.

00:55:16.290 --> 00:55:18.260
And that's actually what
initially almost attracted me

00:55:18.260 --> 00:55:19.900
to work on Triassic age rocks,

00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:21.040
which is at the origin of mammals

00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:22.760
where much of that transition happened.

00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:24.170
It really can be traced very powerfully,

00:55:24.170 --> 00:55:26.380
and there's several lines
of evidence that do it.

00:55:26.380 --> 00:55:27.810
Number one is the embryology.

00:55:27.810 --> 00:55:29.290
Number two is the genetics,

00:55:29.290 --> 00:55:31.530
that is there is a genetic
signature to each of these arches

00:55:31.530 --> 00:55:33.440
that's present in the arches of fish,

00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:36.570
but also in the ear bones of mammals.

00:55:36.570 --> 00:55:38.500
It's also in the
innervation of these things,

00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:40.310
the first arch structure in both cases,

00:55:40.310 --> 00:55:42.970
which is mandibular, has a
certain type of innervation

00:55:42.970 --> 00:55:44.610
that's different from the
second arch structure,

00:55:44.610 --> 00:55:46.300
which is the facial nerve and so forth.

00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:49.020
So, it's written deeply in
the comparative anatomy,

00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:51.470
in the muscles, the nerves,
the arteries, the bones,

00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:53.606
in the developmental
processes that produce them,

00:55:53.606 --> 00:55:56.480
in the genes that specify
that developmental process.

00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:57.680
I mean, it's really...

00:55:57.680 --> 00:55:59.391
I'm frothing at the
mouth, it's so beautiful.

00:55:59.391 --> 00:56:02.232
(audience laughs)

00:56:02.232 --> 00:56:03.290
- [Man In Orange Shirt]
In your first lecture,

00:56:03.290 --> 00:56:06.780
you mentioned that the
transition from water to land

00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:08.380
happened only once.

00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:12.450
What are the evidences that it
did really happen only once?

00:56:12.450 --> 00:56:13.580
- Yeah, that's an awesome question

00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:15.190
because if parallel evolution is the rule,

00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:16.950
maybe it happened multiple times.

00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:18.770
The thing about it is that
the reason why we think

00:56:18.770 --> 00:56:19.730
it had only happened once,

00:56:19.730 --> 00:56:22.060
is 'cause the number of characteristics

00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:25.010
we can use on the
evolutionary tree as evidence

00:56:25.010 --> 00:56:27.900
to support that view, that
evolve across the body.

00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:29.570
So, if there was parallel
evolution in that way,

00:56:29.570 --> 00:56:31.320
it would have to be body-wide

00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:34.860
and multiple systems from
the vertebrae to the head

00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:37.230
to the limbs, to the
shoulder, and so forth.

00:56:37.230 --> 00:56:41.140
So, at our evidence for
that is the characteristics,

00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:44.330
the multiple large number
of them that support

00:56:44.330 --> 00:56:48.193
the evolutionary tree
that's just only once.

00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:53.850
I should say that
embryologists in the '30s

00:56:53.850 --> 00:56:55.280
thought it happened at least twice.

00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:57.520
Once in salamanders,
and once in the lineage

00:56:57.520 --> 00:56:59.850
that led to frogs and amniotes,

00:56:59.850 --> 00:57:01.713
creatures that develop in eggs.

00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:04.580
But no, the evidence
is the characteristics

00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:05.480
that we use to make trees,

00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:07.430
and there's a lot of them in that case.

00:57:10.810 --> 00:57:13.387
- [David] Please join me in
thanking Professor Shubin

00:57:13.387 --> 00:57:14.702
for these two outstanding lectures.

00:57:14.702 --> 00:57:15.684
(audience applause)

00:57:15.684 --> 00:57:16.736
- Thank you.

00:57:16.736 --> 00:57:19.736
(audience applause)

00:57:22.244 --> 00:57:24.744
(funky music)
