00:00:00.961 --> 00:00:02.778
- [Instructor] So let's say
we're in a very simplified world

00:00:02.778 --> 00:00:05.586
where we have two countries,
Country A and Country B

00:00:05.586 --> 00:00:09.152
and they're each capable of
producing apples or bananas

00:00:09.152 --> 00:00:12.213
or some combination of them
and what this chart tells us

00:00:12.213 --> 00:00:16.102
if Country A put all their
energy behind apples in a day

00:00:16.102 --> 00:00:18.219
they could produce three apples,

00:00:18.219 --> 00:00:21.987
and if they put all of their
energy behind bananas in a day

00:00:21.987 --> 00:00:23.988
they could produce six bananas.

00:00:23.988 --> 00:00:26.985
Similarly, Country B, if
they put all of their energy

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:29.630
behind apples in a day they
could produce two apples,

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.912
and Country B if they put all
of their energy behind bananas

00:00:32.912 --> 00:00:36.010
in a day they could produce four bananas.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.416
So given this, who has the
comparative advantage in apples

00:00:40.416 --> 00:00:42.641
and who has the comparative
advantage in bananas

00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:44.747
and how should they trade?

00:00:44.747 --> 00:00:47.825
Pause this video and try to
figure it out on your own.

00:00:47.825 --> 00:00:51.014
All right so when we're thinking
about comparative advantage

00:00:51.014 --> 00:00:52.146
we really want to think about,

00:00:52.146 --> 00:00:53.812
well, what is the opportunity cost

00:00:53.812 --> 00:00:56.293
of producing an apple in each country

00:00:56.293 --> 00:00:57.349
and what is the opportunity cost

00:00:57.349 --> 00:01:00.033
of producing a banana in each country?

00:01:00.033 --> 00:01:02.983
And so let me make another
little subcolumn right over here.

00:01:02.983 --> 00:01:05.681
Opportunity cost, and so
what is the opportunity cost

00:01:05.681 --> 00:01:07.764
of an apple in Country A?

00:01:09.206 --> 00:01:12.043
And pause this video at any
point if you get inspired.

00:01:12.043 --> 00:01:14.192
Well, to produce three apples

00:01:14.192 --> 00:01:16.746
they would have to trade off six bananas.

00:01:16.746 --> 00:01:18.454
And so that means that per apple,

00:01:18.454 --> 00:01:20.871
they are not producing two bananas.

00:01:20.871 --> 00:01:23.871
So this is two bananas, two bananas.

00:01:26.511 --> 00:01:29.844
I'll just write bana, bananas per apple.

00:01:32.382 --> 00:01:34.762
And their opportunity cost for bananas

00:01:34.762 --> 00:01:36.269
is just going to be
the reciprocal of that.

00:01:36.269 --> 00:01:39.686
So one over two apples, apples per banana

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.802
and then for Country B we
can do a similar calculation

00:01:46.802 --> 00:01:48.696
and you might be noticing
something interesting

00:01:48.696 --> 00:01:49.894
is about to happen.

00:01:49.894 --> 00:01:53.955
What's Country B's
opportunity cost of apples?

00:01:53.955 --> 00:01:55.465
Well, one way to think about it,

00:01:55.465 --> 00:01:57.036
if they produce two apples,

00:01:57.036 --> 00:01:59.288
that means they're giving up four bananas.

00:01:59.288 --> 00:02:01.931
Or they're giving up
two bananas per apple.

00:02:01.931 --> 00:02:04.764
So two bananas, bananas per apple.

00:02:08.652 --> 00:02:10.275
And once again, if we
want to think in terms

00:02:10.275 --> 00:02:11.962
of the opportunity cost of a banana,

00:02:11.962 --> 00:02:14.676
well, to produce four bananas
they're giving up two apples.

00:02:14.676 --> 00:02:18.259
So this is one half of
an apple per banana.

00:02:21.877 --> 00:02:24.849
Per, I'll just write,
banana right over there.

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.301
So this one is a little bit interesting.

00:02:27.301 --> 00:02:31.134
They have the same
opportunity cost for apples

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:37.183
in terms of bananas, and they
have the some opportunity cost

00:02:37.183 --> 00:02:40.558
for bananas in terms of apples.

00:02:40.558 --> 00:02:45.063
And so because they have
the same opportunity costs.

00:02:45.063 --> 00:02:49.230
So let me write this down,
same opportunity costs.

00:02:54.776 --> 00:02:57.434
There is no comparative advantage.

00:02:57.434 --> 00:03:00.969
So no comparative advantage in either.

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:02.636
Advantage in either.

00:03:06.188 --> 00:03:08.520
And so based on our very simple model here

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.020
there are no gains from trade.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.332
Another way we could visualize this

00:03:18.332 --> 00:03:21.306
that maybe makes it maybe
hopefully a little bit more clear.

00:03:21.306 --> 00:03:24.360
So let me make one axis here.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.573
I'm trying to draw a
straight line, all right.

00:03:26.573 --> 00:03:30.290
And then this is my other
axis right over here.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.491
And let's make this one right
over here, this horizontal one

00:03:34.491 --> 00:03:36.718
let's make this the apples axis

00:03:36.718 --> 00:03:40.858
and let's make the vertical
one the bananas axis.

00:03:40.858 --> 00:03:45.256
And we're saying per
day and this of course

00:03:45.256 --> 00:03:49.339
is apples per day and so
if we look at Country A.

00:03:52.345 --> 00:03:53.797
Let me do Country A in a new color.

00:03:53.797 --> 00:03:55.650
So Country A, let's say orange.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.737
If they put all their energy behind apples

00:03:57.737 --> 00:04:00.070
they could produce one, two.

00:04:01.268 --> 00:04:02.415
Let me spread this out a little bit.

00:04:02.415 --> 00:04:06.582
They could produce one,
two, three apples in a day.

00:04:08.152 --> 00:04:09.991
If they put all their
energy behind bananas

00:04:09.991 --> 00:04:14.158
they could produce, let's just
say this is two, four, six.

00:04:16.171 --> 00:04:19.503
So that's six, this is four, this is two.

00:04:19.503 --> 00:04:21.473
This is three right over here.

00:04:21.473 --> 00:04:24.281
Let me put markers in-between
to make this clear.

00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:26.666
So if they put all of
their energy into bananas

00:04:26.666 --> 00:04:28.472
they could produce six in a day

00:04:28.472 --> 00:04:30.364
and so their production possibilities

00:04:30.364 --> 00:04:33.788
if we assume it is a linear trade-off

00:04:33.788 --> 00:04:35.985
would look something like this

00:04:35.985 --> 00:04:37.701
and the slope right over here,

00:04:37.701 --> 00:04:41.108
this would be the opportunity cost.

00:04:41.108 --> 00:04:44.742
So the slope right over here,
every time we increase apples

00:04:44.742 --> 00:04:47.575
by one we decrease bananas by two.

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:53.736
So in this situation, we
would have, so the slope here

00:04:56.607 --> 00:04:59.171
is equal to, well, it's
actually a negative slope.

00:04:59.171 --> 00:05:03.338
It's equal to negative two
bananas, bananas per apple.

00:05:06.074 --> 00:05:07.976
So this right over here, this slope

00:05:07.976 --> 00:05:09.543
based on how I picked the axes,

00:05:09.543 --> 00:05:13.323
this is giving me the
opportunity cost for apples

00:05:13.323 --> 00:05:14.406
in terms of bananas.

00:05:14.406 --> 00:05:15.553
Every time I increase an apple

00:05:15.553 --> 00:05:18.130
how many bananas am I actually giving up?

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.961
So that is my opportunity cost there.

00:05:19.961 --> 00:05:21.920
And now if we think about Country B.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.448
Let me do this in a new color.

00:05:24.448 --> 00:05:26.187
I'm running out of colors.

00:05:26.187 --> 00:05:28.962
Country B right over here
they could either produce

00:05:28.962 --> 00:05:32.893
four bananas or two apples
or things in-between.

00:05:32.893 --> 00:05:35.988
But notice, it has the exact same slope

00:05:35.988 --> 00:05:38.453
The slope is the opportunity cost.

00:05:38.453 --> 00:05:40.359
And if we switch these
axes right over here

00:05:40.359 --> 00:05:43.572
then the slope would be the
opportunity cost for bananas

00:05:43.572 --> 00:05:46.255
in terms of apples, but
the big takeaway here,

00:05:46.255 --> 00:05:49.135
if you see the production
possibilities of two countries

00:05:49.135 --> 00:05:51.125
and we're talking about two goods

00:05:51.125 --> 00:05:52.898
and they have the same slope,

00:05:52.898 --> 00:05:54.435
then that means their opportunity costs

00:05:54.435 --> 00:05:55.954
are going to be the same, and there's not

00:05:55.954 --> 00:05:57.449
going to be a gain from trade.

00:05:57.449 --> 00:05:59.415
Remember, the whole point
of comparative advantage

00:05:59.415 --> 00:06:03.223
and trading is that both
countries will benefit.

00:06:03.223 --> 00:06:04.979
That's really the big takeaway here.

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:06.058
But there are situations

00:06:06.058 --> 00:06:07.440
where both countries wouldn't benefit

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.804
because they have the
same opportunity cost

00:06:09.804 --> 00:06:11.610
and this was an example of one of them.

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.163
Now the other case,
sometimes one will have

00:06:15.163 --> 00:06:16.428
a comparative advantage over the other.

00:06:16.428 --> 00:06:18.441
They do have different opportunity costs

00:06:18.441 --> 00:06:20.368
and then you might have
no gains from trade.

00:06:20.368 --> 00:06:21.201
Maybe there's some way

00:06:21.201 --> 00:06:23.498
that they can't know each
other's opportunity costs.

00:06:23.498 --> 00:06:24.813
There's some way that they don't trade.

00:06:24.813 --> 00:06:28.346
Maybe irrespective of
what the models tell us

00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:30.018
about comparative advantage
some country says,

00:06:30.018 --> 00:06:31.338
hey, I don't want to produce bananas.

00:06:31.338 --> 00:06:34.310
Apples are the future, that's
a higher skilled industry,

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.154
whatever else, so there's
definitely scenarios,

00:06:37.154 --> 00:06:40.543
especially even in our model,
in our very simplified model

00:06:40.543 --> 00:06:42.502
where there might not be gains from trade.

00:06:42.502 --> 00:06:44.389
And the classic one of course is when

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:46.738
there's no comparative
advantage and both countries

00:06:46.738 --> 00:06:49.108
have the same opportunity
costs in the goods.
