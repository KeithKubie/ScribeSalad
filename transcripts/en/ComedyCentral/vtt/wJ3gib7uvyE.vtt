I DON'T BURN THINGS

00:00:06.974 --> 00:00:08.509
BECAUSE MY TEAMS
WIN CHAMPIONSHIPS.

00:00:08.542 --> 00:00:10.277
I DO IT
FOR THE INSURANCE MONEY.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.846

I HOPE IT'S NOT TOO MUCH
TO ASK,

00:00:15.616 --> 00:00:18.051
BUT I'D CONSIDER IT AN HONOR
IF YOU'D BITCH SLAP ME

00:00:18.085 --> 00:00:19.286
AS HARD AS YOU CAN.

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:20.888

00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:25.726
- "BITCH SLAP."
THAT'S OFFENSIVE.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:27.160
I SHOULD SLAP THAT BITCH.

00:00:27.194 --> 00:00:28.729
STEVE, YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT'S IT LIKE

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:30.631
TO BE THE ONLY BLACK PERSON
FOR MILES AROUND.

00:00:30.664 --> 00:00:32.966
EVERYONE STARING AT ME,
LIKE I'M A CRIMINAL!

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.570
[people murmuring]

00:00:36.603 --> 00:00:38.839
- WHAT? I DON'T SEE
WHAT YOU'RE SO MAD AT.

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:40.507
SO PEOPLE ENJOY LOOKING
AT YOU.

00:00:40.541 --> 00:00:42.276
YOU'RE, LIKE, A--

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:43.544
- LIKE A MONKEY IN THE ZOO?

00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:45.646
- EXACTLY, YOU'RE LIKE
A MONKEY IN THE ZOO.

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:47.014
PERFECT ANALOGY.

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:49.116
- DO YOU KNOW
HOW RACIST THAT IS?

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:50.450
- RACIST? COME ON.

00:00:50.484 --> 00:00:52.486
WE BOTH KNOW
THERE'S NO RACISM ANYMORE.

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:53.587
IT ENDED THE DAY

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.556
MARTIN LUTHER KING
LANDED ON THE MOON.

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:57.391
- MAN, YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

00:00:57.424 --> 00:00:59.660
- I WOULD LOVE TO BE BLACK
IN TODAY'S SOCIETY.

00:00:59.693 --> 00:01:01.161
YOU SET ALL THE TRENDS,

00:01:01.195 --> 00:01:03.063
AND YOU GET TO SAY
THE "N" WORD.

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:04.598
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW MANY TIMES

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:06.066
I'VE WANTED TO SAY
THE "N" WORD.

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.201
- YOU KNOW WHAT, STEVE?

00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:08.669
I NEED SOME TIME AWAY
FROM YOUR DUMB ASS.

00:01:08.702 --> 00:01:10.504
- WAIT. YOU'RE NOT MAD AT ME,
ARE YOU?

00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:11.805
- OH, NO.
I'M NOT MAD.

00:01:11.839 --> 00:01:13.407
[engine revs]

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.976

MIXED SIGNALS.
