[bright music]

00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:06.773

What if we told y'all
that once a month,

00:00:12.246 --> 00:00:14.014 line:0%
 
half the human race
is in pain?

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:17.417 line:0%
 
And the other half

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:21.688 line:0%
 
don't want to hear shit
about it?

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:22.890 line:0%
 
- I'm Shaboots Michaels!
- I'm T-Ray Tombstone!

Welcome to...

(both)
Menstruation Orientation!

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:29.830
Oh, no,
you don't.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:30.797
Now, we know you don't want
to hear about it.

00:00:30.898 --> 00:00:32.165
But they don't
want to have it,

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:34.935
so sit your ass down and listen
for once in your life.

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:36.637
Today we're gonna talk
to all you men

00:00:36.737 --> 00:00:39.106
about what happens to your women
when they're on their periods

00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:40.374
and why
it's important to...

00:00:40.474 --> 00:00:42.876
(both)
Be sensitive to that shit.

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:45.812
Don't say "chillax," "relax,"
"calm down," and "how come?"

00:00:45.913 --> 00:00:49.383
Don't say "ass," "fat,"
"grumpy," or "cranky."

00:00:49.483 --> 00:00:50.717
They ain't cranky.

00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:52.986
They got blood coming
out of their vaginas, y'all!

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:55.255
That's some biblical
plague shit, y'all!

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:57.524
That would be like
once a month

00:00:57.624 --> 00:00:59.393
if you had locusts flying
out of your dick for a week!

00:00:59.493 --> 00:01:01.028
Your ass
wouldn't be cranky.

00:01:01.128 --> 00:01:02.262
Your ass
would be like...

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:06.266
- Oh, fuck!
[both screaming]

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:07.901
- My dick!
[screaming continues]

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:12.706
(both)
So be nice to your bitches
when they bleeding!

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:14.675
If you ain't
getting 'em shit...

00:01:14.775 --> 00:01:15.776
Get the fuck
out they way!

00:01:15.876 --> 00:01:18.145
- They got cramps!
- They got headaches.

00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:19.079
They got weight gain!

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:20.314
And every time
they pee,

00:01:20.414 --> 00:01:22.449
it's like <i>The Shining</i>
in the toilet.

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:24.518
- Be supportive.
- Be empathetic.

00:01:24.618 --> 00:01:25.452
But whatever you do...

00:01:25.552 --> 00:01:28.422
(both)
Do not try to solve it!

00:01:28.522 --> 00:01:29.389
Don't even bring
that shit up!

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:31.658
When women be
hanging out together,

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:33.360
their periods
will sync up.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.362
Vaginas
be communicating.

00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:37.297
They got their own
vagina language.

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:38.265
(both)
Talking about...

00:01:38.365 --> 00:01:40.534
[both speaking gibberish]

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:46.874
If you find yourself
around a group of women

00:01:46.974 --> 00:01:49.142
and they all have
a backache...

00:01:49.243 --> 00:01:51.144
(both)
Back away slowly.

00:01:51.245 --> 00:01:52.312
What's that in your pocket
there, Shaboots?

00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:55.582
Recognize this,
motherfuckers?

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:57.251
That ain't
space dynamite.

00:01:57.351 --> 00:01:58.552
That's a tampon.

00:01:58.652 --> 00:02:00.888
Learn what your bitch
has to go through.

00:02:00.988 --> 00:02:03.690
First, you put
this piece in your vagina!

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:04.825
Oop.

00:02:04.925 --> 00:02:05.893
Then you push this part
into the first piece!

00:02:05.993 --> 00:02:07.728
Gweeps

00:02:07.828 --> 00:02:09.730
Then you throw
this part away!

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.633
Do that several times
a day for a week

00:02:12.733 --> 00:02:14.635
every goddamn month!

00:02:14.735 --> 00:02:17.571
It's the worst thing ever
all the time!

00:02:17.671 --> 00:02:19.006
It's much worse for them

00:02:19.106 --> 00:02:20.507
than it is for you
to hear about it.

00:02:20.607 --> 00:02:22.709
And periods
is important.

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:23.677
That's how the body
gets rid of the old egg

00:02:23.777 --> 00:02:25.779
so it can cook up
them new ones.

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:26.980
So listen to what's
going on with your female

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.916
emotionally and...

00:02:29.016 --> 00:02:30.751
(both)
Get your bitch
some chocolate!

00:02:30.851 --> 00:02:32.419
Don't call her
a bitch, but...

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.021
(both)
Get your bitch
some chocolate!

00:02:34.121 --> 00:02:36.657
