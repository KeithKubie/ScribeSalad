00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.330 position:56%
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Well, good evening and
welcome to the Library of Congress.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.630
I'm John Cole.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.540
I'm the Director of Library of
Congress's Center for The Book.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.090
It's the book reading literacy
arm of the Library of Congress,

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.860
which also takes a special interest
in promoting the history of books,

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.290
reading, literacy, and libraries.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.100
We were created by Daniel
Boorstin, when he was the Librarian

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:55.930 position:56%
of Congress in 1977, to reach out to
the general public, to promote books

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.990
and reading in the name of
the Library of Congress.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.840
And so I'm very lucky.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.190
I have a job that also
keeps me closely involved

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.570
with wonderful Library
of Congress activities,

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.770
such as the National Book Festival,
which we held very successfully,

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:18.120
much to our surprise, amazement,
and delight on Labor Day, Saturday,

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.410
and you'll be pleased to know,
we don't have a date yet,

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.940
but we pretty much decided, again,
to our surprise and amazement,

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.440
that we're going to stay at the
Convention Center and be there

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.570
to try to move it a little bit
further towards the fall they have

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.050
the Labor Day weekend that we
got stuck with, But in a way,

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.750
it was our own fault, because we
actually felt we wanted to stay

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.180
on the mall, and we did until
we lost it and were late

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.270
in getting the room at
the convention center.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.570
In another year, next year, we
will be at the Convention Center,

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.380
and then we will settle in, I
think, and it has many advantages.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.460
The Center for the Book also
has other responsibilities

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.000
within the library.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.520
One of them is a new one,
and that is on behalf

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.050
of the Young Readers Center
at the Library of Congress.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.990
We are going to be joining with the
University of Maryland in a variety

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.150
of cooperative activities.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.910
The Young Readers Center was
opened under the auspices

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.970
of the Center for the Book in 2009.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.640
I'm also a historian for
the Library of Congress,

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.430
and so I know that this
was especially significant.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.980
It was the first time in
our, at the time, the 2000 --

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.820
209 years that we'd opened a space
directly for service to kids.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.280
For under 16 accompanied
by an adult, it's a place,

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.410
not a reading room,
but a wonderful reading

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.310
and knowledge-creating space, and
it's in the Jefferson Building.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.300
The room was made available --

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.100
the rooms were made available when
our Motion Picture Broadcasting

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.690
and Recorded Sound Division
moved to Culpeper, Virginia,

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:09.270 position:56%
thanks to a private gift, and that
was a wonderful way to create space,

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.500 position:56%
and our Librarian of Congress, James
Billington, realized the importance

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.030
of looking at younger readers
and the new educational role

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.040
of the library of Congress, which
we've been playing, actually,

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.600
about since the time the Center
for the Book was created in 1977.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.100
And we are fortunate
to have that space.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.410
Tonight, I was able to
take a small group of you

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.840
to see the young readers Center,
and I want to take this opportunity

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.310
to introduce Karen Jaffe, who is in
the front row, who is the director,

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.510
and I would like Karen
to stand and be known.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.040
[ Applause ]

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:54.010
She's doing a wonderful job and has
a point of view that helps mirror,

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.940 position:56%
for young people, what is
happening in the rest of the Library

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.310
of Congress, in the sense

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.690
that we have major exhibits
throughout the Library of Congress.

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.680
Our new civil rights,
under Karen's leadership,

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.360
there would be a small
exhibit aimed at young people

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.640
on the subject of civil rights.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:18.570 position:56%
For the first time, we have other
related displays that emphasize how,

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.750
in fact, the entire Library, of
Congress, whether they know it

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.350
or not, does help young people.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.630
So having the Young Readers
Center gives us a focal point

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.810
for these activities, which magnify
the importance of the Library

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.250
of Congress itself in American
life in American culture,

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.040
and Thomas Jefferson I always think
when I think about the opening

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.820
of the Young Readers Center,
would be smiling on this,

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.900
because initially --
this is the last part

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.220
of your history lesson, I promise.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.670
Initially, Jefferson, when the
British burned the capital,

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:00.490
the first location of the Library
of Congress in 1814, Jefferson,

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.250
who'd helped nurse this little
library was in Monticello.

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:09.660
He sold his comprehensive library
at cost back to the Congress

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:15.050
to begin again with the Library
of Congress, but he also hoped

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.310
that this valuable collection,
which covered all subjects,

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.300
would be the substratum, he said
it would be, the substratum someday

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.220
for a great national
library, and gradually,

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.290
that happened after the Civil
War, but it didn't really happen

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:33.000
until we had a reading
room for people under 16,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.380
and that didn't happen until 2009.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.270
So I hope you'll have a chance to
see the Young Readers Center and,

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.250
on behalf of Karen and the rest
of the library, I'm very pleased

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.830
to be part of this new lecture
series and a partnership

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.450
with the University of Maryland.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.510
Thank you very much,
and welcome again.

00:05:51.510 --> 00:06:03.040
[ Applause ]

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.240
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Priest: Well,
good afternoon, and welcome.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.960
My name is Jennifer Priest,
and I'm the Dean of the College

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.050
of Information Studies,
Maryland's iSchool,

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.470
and I want to welcome you all
here, but just before I do that,

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:18.800
I also want to thank John for
his wonderful history lesson.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.520
I'm sorry, you can tell my
accent's British, right?

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.410
I'm sorry the Brits
were so bad in the past,

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.870
but can't be responsible
for all of them.

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.940
So thank you very much, John, and
thank you to all of your staff

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.950
and everybody for just
this amazing location.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:40.010
I mean, this is just a wonderful
place for tonight's event,

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:43.320
and I think it was made very
special by your introduction, John,

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.200
so thank you very, very much.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:52.190 position:56%
So Maryland's College of Information
Studies, the iSchool, is, of course,

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:55.320
not as old as the Library of
Congress, but one of the things

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.290 position:56%
that I did want to mention to you is

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:03.190 position:56%
that we are a very multidisciplinary
college of information studies

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:07.050
at iSchool, and we are
actually also celebrating.

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:11.400
We're celebrating our 50th
anniversary this year and next,

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.340
and don't ask me how we've
managed to have a 50th anniversary

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:18.220
that stretches over two years,
but we're managing to do that.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.960
So I just want to mention that,

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.400
because I think that's an
important feature of our school

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:29.120
and it also links in, a little
bit, with tonight's event.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.370
I'm just very happy to
be one of the people

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:36.000
to really very warmly welcome you,
and I'm thrilled to see so many

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.070
of you here, so many faculty,
staff, visitors, alums.

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:42.770
Many alums here.

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:44.900
It's a little bit of a pity

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.280
that Anne Scott MacLeod
couldn't be here tonight,

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.830
because I'm sure she would have,
you know, been very happy to hear

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:56.310
that this lecture tonight is being
held at the Library of Congress.

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:59.800
But we actually, interestingly,
we have people, I think,

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.460
who know Anne Scott MacLeod here,

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:06.220
and Diane Barlow will be probably
a little embarrassed that I'm going

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.250
to say this, but Anne was
one of Diane's students.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:13.510
So we have some of Diane's
PhD students here, as well.

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:15.460
&gt;&gt; Diane Barlow: The other one.

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.350
The other way.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:23.680
I was fortunate enough to be
Anne's first doctorate student.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.790
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Priest: That's what
I -- isn't that what I said?

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:27.530
You were one of her students?

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:32.340
Yeah, yeah, so Diane was one of
Anne's first doctoral students,

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:37.340
and many people have benefited
hugely from Anne's presence,

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:43.190 position:56%
and she, in fact, joined the College
of Information Studies in 1973

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:45.490
and was really responsible

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:50.460
for helping make our college a
very interdisciplinary college

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:55.490
and to bring children's literature
to the forefront and make

00:08:55.490 --> 00:09:00.670
that a very respectable and
much-cherished academic study area.

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:04.760
And of course now, we have many
people who are interested in youth,

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.860
youth scholarship,
children's literature,

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:11.380
and many other topics
related to youth and reading.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.290
So I think John will probably
be pleased to hear that.

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:19.280
So just having this lecture in this
wonderful place is just a pleasure.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:23.170
So I very warmly welcome all
of you, and thank you very,

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:25.210
very much for coming tonight.

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:27.280
And some of you, I know.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:31.280
Some of you are new faces,
but if I don't know you,

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.940
that I hope you'll keep
in touch with the college.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:37.520
Many faculty and staff are
here, and let me just finish

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:42.570
by thinking very much all the
faculty and staff who helped

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:46.330
and worked with our colleagues
at the Library of Congress

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:49.720
to make this a nice
event for us tonight,

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.300
and you'll hear a bit
more about that.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:56.340
But I have great pleasure now
in introducing Maria Salvatore,

00:09:56.340 --> 00:10:00.600
who's going to introduce
us to tonight's speaker.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.510
So thank you all for coming.

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:17.110
[ Applause ]

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:20.010
&gt;&gt; Maria Salvatore: I'd like
to add my welcome to everybody,

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:23.690
but I'd also like to invite
readers to travel through time

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:27.020
and the United States to
meet Felicity, Josefina,

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.620
Samantha, Kit, and other girls.

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:33.940
They can visit a summer camp
where Nate and Zach, among others,

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:39.240 position:56%
confront and overcome challenges
that have bearing on everyday lives,

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.190
well beyond the confines
of their camp.

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:46.230 position:56%
These and other characters continue
to resonate with readers, both young

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:51.320 position:56%
and experienced, when they meet the
characters created by Valerie Tripp.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.020
She's written over 31
American Girl books

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:59.660
and is the creative editor behind
a new series called Boys' Camp.

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:03.090
Books and stories have always
been important to Valerie.

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:05.850
She was born and raised not far
from New York City in Mount Kisco,

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:11.510
New York, were words and language
seem part of the fabric of family.

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:14.540
Words continued in
importance to Ms. Tripp,

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:18.430
as she continued her
education and in her career.

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:22.260 position:56%
She graduated from Yale University's
first coeducational class

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:23.560
and later did graduate work

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:27.180
at Harvard University,
focusing on reeducation.

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:30.160
In addition to the American
Girl and Boys' Camp books,

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.810
Valerie has been a freelance
writer for educational publishers,

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:37.020
as well as other major
trade publishing houses.

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:41.940
In an article that she wrote,
which can be read on her website,

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:46.800
Ms. Tripp answers the question most
often asked to her by children,

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.830
and I would guess adults, too.

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:51.160
Where you get your
ideas for your books?

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:55.920
Her response, and I quote, "I
have concocted this lofty answer.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.350
The ideas come from research,
memory, and imagination,

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:02.890
but in fact, those three
words are euphemisms."

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:05.550
She goes on to explain
that she's really a snoop,

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:07.740
and empathetic daydreamer.

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:09.190 position:56%
Additionally, she has a good memory,

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:11.750
and so many of Valerie's
experiences,

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:15.830 position:56%
including her hands-on work with
children, find their way into books.

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:19.580
This creates an emotional
authenticity and all of her work

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:23.760
that resonates with readers
of all ages and backgrounds.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:28.660
Please join me in welcoming the
2014 Anne Scott MacLeod lecturer,

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:32.120
a sensitive snoop, who remembers
the essence of her own childhood

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:33.920
to white readers today
Valerie Tripp.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:45.860
[ Applause ]

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.870
&gt;&gt; Valerie Tripp: Thank you.

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:49.270
I'm very glad to be here.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:52.220
Let me get all settled here.

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:55.910
I'm actually always reassured when
I see, you know, a speaker come up

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:58.010
and have something written down.

00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:00.840
So you figure it's not
going to be like a stream

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:04.190
of consciousness, a
bit disorganized.

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:05.490
So thank you very much.

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:08.160
I'm so honored to be here today.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.010
It's like a dream come true,
and it's maybe all of you

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:18.560
who work here take it for granted,
but to walk into a building that's,

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:21.840
you know, part of the Library
of Congress and, you know,

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:26.590
have a purpose for being here
is just really exhilarating.

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:28.520
So thank you very, very much.

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.240
And thank you for the opportunity

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:34.330
to present the Anne
Scott MacLeod lecture.

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.840
Maria invited me back in February.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:40.360
So my wonderful husband, who
is here, has heard me talking

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:44.550
about ideas for the
speech for eight months.

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:45.940
Eight months.

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:48.120
And really, I have to say the idea

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.990
of making this speech
has been a gift from you.

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:52.290
So thank you very much.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:58.530
It has been a lens through which I
have sort of evaluated everything

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:01.230
that I've read or experienced
or encountered

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:02.530
in the last eight months.

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:05.530
It's really been a kick
in the consciousness,

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:11.870
and it's been a reason to analyze,
not without the occasional dismay,

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:16.150
my work habits are my more
dogged passions, as well.

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:18.320
So I'm grateful to you for that.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:21.190
It's really led me to challenge
assumptions, and so, hence,

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:25.780
the title of my talk today, and
it's been an excuse to do research,

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:27.330
which of course, I love to do.

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:29.070
So I'm grateful for that too.

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:33.420
But mostly, mostly, thinking about
what I would say today was a reason

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:38.550
to think about what I do and
how much I love what I do,

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:41.380
which is writing stories
for children.

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.270
Don't you just love books?

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:44.570
Don't you?

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:48.370
Especially, I think,
love books for children.

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:50.240
I think, you know, I just --

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.110
we're all really lucky
to be engaged with them.

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:56.260 position:56%
I'm going to make a very
non-challenging assumption right now

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.390
that all of us are booklovers here.

00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:02.550
We're either writers or librarians
or media specialists, researchers,

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:05.120
editors, and readers, and
I think there's something

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.190
about being involved with
children's literature

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:09.970
that just nurtures optimism.

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:11.440
You can't help it.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:12.740
You just can't help it.

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:16.920
The children are the
very embodiment of --

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:20.980
they are the personification
of promise

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:24.680
and potential, wacky
though they are.

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.230
And we're right there.

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:30.510
We're right on the spot
to witness how books

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:34.540
and stories nourish their growth.

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:39.050
I know that writing for children
in and of itself is an optimistic

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:41.770
and sometimes, I feel,
foolishly optimistic to act.

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:46.290
Sort of a leap of faith, a
cheerful trusting transformation,

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:50.700 position:56%
that may be, you know, out of chaos,
a order and a story will emerge

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.540
and maybe that sort of, you
know, little, you know, ping,

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:55.940
moment of connection
with your reader.

00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:59.390
That way you know it's really
resonated with your reader.

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:04.110
And all of you who are lucky enough
to be the people who hand the books

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:08.710
and the stories to children know
that you're changing their lives.

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:10.010
You're changing their lives.

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:11.960
Is there anything more
wonderful than saying

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.300
to a child I think you're
going to like this book.

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:16.600
And guess what?

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:20.870
Good news, there's more
where that came from.

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:25.600 position:56%
Children's book leave an indelible
impression and an indelible imprint,

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:26.970
and they shape and color

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:29.810
and influence the way a
child perceives the world.

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:33.120
And the books we read as children,
I think, serve as a measure

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:34.790
of all the books that follow.

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:38.770
So I brought with me --
where did she go here?

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:43.290
I brought with me about
my sister gave me.

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:49.510
What did I do with her?

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:51.480
I brought Understood Betsy
that my sister gave me

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:56.470
with the Scholastic book, 35 cents
from the Scholastic Book Club.

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:57.770
Here we go.

00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:05.680
When I was 8 -- so here we have a
book that is clearly well loved,

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:08.240
and you know that phrase
about "I ate it up"?

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.290
Evidently, I chewed it up.

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:12.020
So I just love when they said --

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:14.710
and I reread Understood
Betsy at least once a year.

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:19.980
Understood Betsy, this very
book, and also the Sherwood Ring,

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:22.230
by Elizabeth Marie Pope,

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:25.970
are the reason why I became
a children's book writer

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:27.850
and a writer of historical fiction.

00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:31.010
Those books that you put in
children's hands are going

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:36.040
to have an enormous influence
on them their whole life long.

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.740
So I'm going to assume
you chose your profession

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:42.370
because how much you love books
and stories and reading now

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:45.740
and is much -- that you loved
it when you were a child,

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:48.090
and just because sometimes
the work part

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:52.600 position:56%
of doing what we love overcomes the
love part of doing what our work is,

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:55.880
I want us to all just take a moment
and just luxuriate and reflect

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.610
for a moment about
why we love books.

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:03.430
As Anne Lamott says in Bird
by Bird, to some of us,

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:07.850
books are as important as
almost anything on Earth.

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:11.340
What a miracle it is that
out of these small, flat,

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:16.720
rigid squares of paper unfolds
world after world after world.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:21.220
Worlds that sing to you
comfort, quiet, or excite you.

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:25.690
Books help us understand who we
are and how we are to behave.

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:28.900
An author makes you notice,
makes you pay attention,

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:33.150
and this is a great gift, but
I am here to say it is a gift

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:36.790
that would remain unwrapped
if it weren't for all of you.

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:40.230
I'm determined to get you
all fired up by reminding you

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:42.100
of why you do what you do and talk

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.710
about assumptions as
I was writing this.

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:46.020
My mother's voice was
in my ear saying,

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:49.900
"Don't assume people know
how grateful you are.

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:51.720
Say thank you."

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:54.850
So I'm saying thank
you to all of you, too.

00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:57.700
Reading still seem like a
miracle to me, and books too,

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:00.530
because they never let you down.

00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:02.050
They're good companions.

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:03.810
They don't waste your time.

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:06.630
They don't need to be
recharged or plugged in

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:10.920
or ruin your circadian rhythm with,
you know, blue light, and they are,

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:14.140
you know, just good and
rich and deep and eternally,

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:16.720
eternally a book says enter.

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.820
Enter, come again.

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:21.300
Richard Wilber expresses
this very beautifully

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.260
in his poem called the reader.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.850
She's going back these
days to the great stories

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:29.040
that charmed her younger
mind, knowing, as she does,

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:33.200
what will become of them in
Bloody Field or Tuscan garden.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:37.570
It may be that, at times, she
sees their first and final selves

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:43.420 position:56%
at once, as a god might, to whom
all time is now, but the true wonder

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:47.220
of it is that she, for all
she may know of consequences,

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:50.480
still turns enchanted
to the next bright page.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.920
Is that lovely?

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.220
Is that lovely?

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:55.180
And I think it's a wise idea
to go back and reread books,

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:59.530
because as Billy Collins reminds
us in his poem, Forgetfulness,

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:02.700
the name of the author is the
first to go, followed obediently

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:04.930
by the title of the plot,
the heartbreaking conclusion,

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:08.030
the entire novel, which suddenly
becomes one you've never read

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:09.430
and never even heard of.

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:12.270
So I think it behooves all
of us to read and reread.

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:14.200
It's kind of like when you
say to yourself now, you know,

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.530
I know there's a reason
why I came into this room.

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:18.930
I just can't remember what it is.

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:22.070
But both Wilber and Collins
do assume that the story got

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:24.550
into your head somehow,
and I'm going to say

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:28.160
that probably was some wonderful
librarian's generous act

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.460
of giving you that book.

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:33.410
So to say thank you, I want
to supply you with some facts.

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:37.460
The next time someone looks up, you
know, from his cell phone and says,

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:40.920
oh, you know, libraries are
soon to be a thing of the past.

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.270
So here's what I want you to say
innocently, sort of lure them

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:45.900
into a false sense of security.

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:47.200
Oh, oh, do you think so?

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:50.290
And then I want you to knock his
socks off with the following.

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:52.840
Challenge his assumption
by saying this is the first

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.880
of four assumptions that
you'll hear in the speech.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.150
So you can, you know, keep
track on your fingers.

00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:58.450
This is number one.

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:01.360
So the assumption that libraries
are soon to be out of date.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:08.980
There are 123,291 libraries of
all kinds in the United States,

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:12.060
and more than 20 years after
some people predicted the demise

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:14.250
of libraries because of
the Internet, in fact,

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:16.420
the exact opposite has occurred.

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:20.890
Visits increased 61%, between
1994 and 2004, and now,

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:22.990
in 2014, they topped 2 billion.

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:26.660
No wonder you're tired
at the end of the day.

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:29.160
Despite widespread belief
that libraries are funded

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.020
by the federal government, in fact,

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:34.760
a whopping 81% comes
from local tax dollars.

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:39.050
That means the funding comes from
people that the library serves.

00:21:39.050 --> 00:21:42.740
That's why the library's
the heart of the community,

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:47.110
and that's why you are the
stewards of a treasure that's part

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:50.870 position:56%
of that heart of the community, and
those are just the cold, hard facts.

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:53.940
Once you've won your point with
statistics, I want you to go

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:58.150
on to enjoy your victory and
pursue your doubting Thomas,

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:02.090
reminding him that you put
books in the hands of children,

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:05.420
books with which they will
construct their characters,

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:07.730 position:56%
their view of the world, their ideas

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:10.270
of the purpose and
challenge of life.

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:14.300
Books stretch children's brains
and hearts and give them a sense

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:18.230
of themselves as unique beings
with contributions to make.

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:22.020
Books spark interest, feed
passions, ignite ambitions.

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:25.170
They are an ongoing, reliable
source of entertainment,

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:28.590
education, rest, and reflection.

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:30.990
The books you give children
introduce those children

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:35.780 position:56%
to characters, and therefore, teach
the children empathy and compassion.

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:39.460
I saw a recent study that said
reading fiction improves one's

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:41.360
ability to understand others.

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:42.660
You think?

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:44.850
I mean, really?

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:46.880
It took a study to figure that out,

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.180
and then my friend Eddy Ching
[assumed spelling] points

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:50.930
out that sodas nonfiction.

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:54.560
Of course, nonfiction stories have
heart and emotion, in addition to,

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:58.240 position:56%
of course, providing facts that
will give a child a sense of mastery

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:02.550 position:56%
and curiosity and give children a
sense that they, too, can contribute

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:05.860
to their community, whether it's
friends or family or the world.

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:09.580
Nonfiction can teach children
about other cultures and religions

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:11.320
and tastes and senses of humor.

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:13.250 position:56%
So they'll connect and feel and hear

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:16.080
and experience the
excitement of discovery.

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:19.250
So I want you also to be
sure to point out to yourself

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:23.930
or doubting Thomas that these
book-influenced empathetic children

00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:27.450
will be caring for
him in his dotage.

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:30.930
So doesn't he want to be sure that
that's empathetic, caring person?

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:33.440
By connecting children with
books, you're exposing them

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:37.160
to the correct way to express
themselves in written language

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:41.210
so that they may connect with
others and discipline themselves,

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:44.280
to articulate what is in
their hearts and minds.

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:48.920
As Margaret Edson, the author of
Wit writes, "Sitting by herself,

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:50.770
forcing the swirl of thoughts

00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:55.420
into a linear systematic journey
forward, it makes you smarter.

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:58.020 position:56%
It's like a pastry bag, literacy is.

00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:01.060
It presses you into one clear line.

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:03.210
So writing teaches discipline."

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:04.960
Writings tricky, though.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.300
This is me talking now.

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:08.800
Writings tricky, though, because
it's like asking a bunch of,

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:12.450
you know, goldfish to line up or
even just to show up reliably.

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:15.050
So where do ideas come from?

00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:17.250
This leads me to assumption
number two.

00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:20.270
We often hear writers
should write what they know,

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:22.520
and this is a challenging
assumption.

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.810
You can see where you
can use challenge both

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:27.680
as a verb and an adjective here.

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:30.040
So writers should write
from their own experience.

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:35.680
So okay, but I sure do hope that
that means imaginative experience.

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:37.990
In the world of children's
books, there's lots of discussion

00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:41.430
and debate about who has the
right to tell which story.

00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:44.480
Must an author live
a story to write it?

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:48.530
Is it presumptuous, insulting,
condescending to put myself

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:52.200
in someone else's skin, especially
if it's a different color?

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.360
Putting aside the question of
whether or not I do it well,

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:58.870
and granting that, of course,
the more varied voices we hear,

00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:01.840
the more authors of different
races and backgrounds and cultures,

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:05.390
the better, isn't the fact that
an author tries a testament

00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:07.290
to empathy and compassion?

00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:12.150
If we don't trust our imaginations,
what hope is there for us.

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:17.300 position:56%
We write to elucidate, to celebrate,
and if I stumble and fail and fall,

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:19.820
if there's a lack of
authenticity, could there be worth

00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:22.420 position:56%
in that failure for what it reveals?

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:23.870
I don't know.

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:27.640 position:56%
But I do think it is especially
important to tell children, go ahead

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.990
and write about that
person who is different.

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:34.150
You're not bounded by the limits
of your own experience, kid.

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:35.640
In her essay The Right to Write,

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:39.820
Roxanne Robinson calls this radical
empathy, and in another place,

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:43.020
she defines it as bearing
compassionate witness.

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:44.360
I love that phrase.

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:46.320
Bearing compassionate witness.

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:50.210
She says to what it is to be
alive in this place and time.

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:53.930
So I'd say the very act of
writing itself pushes a child

00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:56.490
to challenge assumptions
about himself,

00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:58.520
and writing teaches responsibility.

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.620
Kathleen Norris says, "When
intended to communicate,

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:03.760
the writer is accountable
to the reader.

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.480
She must be hospitable
and welcoming."

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:07.780
I love this part.

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:10.340
"Humble in cutting
what's dear but show offy.

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.840
It's her job to focus attention.

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:17.430
She's engaged in experiencing with
the eye and the ear of the heart.

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:22.110
We write in solitude, but our
readers constitute a community."

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:25.820
So children right to delight, to
entertain, to engage, to connect,

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:27.980
and connecting really leads
us to assumption number three.

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:29.810
We're really tearing
through these assumptions.

00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:31.110
Look at this.

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:32.410
We're going to be at the
reception in no time.

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:34.660
Assumption number three,
another challenging assumption

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:37.190
about the receiving end of stories.

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:39.630
The stories we give
children have to, of course,

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:41.720
be fueled by understandable humor,

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:44.230
shared experience,
common aspirations.

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:46.750
They must delight with
relatable mischief,

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:48.470
friendship, joy, and friendship.

00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:52.470
We assume we're doing a child
a favor by giving him a book --

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:55.530
children favor by giving them books
that have an obvious connection

00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:58.410
to their lives, but I
like to sort of challenge

00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:00.870
that assumption, as well, gently.

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:02.970
I recently read a study
about resilience,

00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:07.220
why some children survive and even
thrive in terrible circumstances,

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:12.350
and a reliable adult figure is
key, but so, too, is imagination.

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:13.650
Imagination.

00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:17.800
Imagination, which when you think
about it, is a branch of hope,

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:21.980
is the ability to imagine different
outcomes, different circumstances,

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:27.420
a different life, a different self,
so shouldn't books stretch a child?

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:30.240
We don't know, actually, what's
going to form the bridge,

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.540
what's going to force
the connection,

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:34.880
and we should not underestimate
our child readers.

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:38.230
We have to engage our readers,
the children, where they are, yes.

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:40.920
Meet their interests, ability,
comprehension, and background

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:44.840
and existing knowledge, but
above all, respect them.

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:46.140
Readers are smart enough.

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:49.450
Boy, if I've learned anything
in the last 27 years it's

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:52.690
that readers are smart enough
to understand that, for example,

00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:56.890
in the Kit books, The Depression is
a metaphor for any undeserved whack

00:27:56.890 --> 00:27:59.820
or wallop your family might take.

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:03.700
Readers saw, before I did,
that Josephina's aunt was

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:08.260
like a stepmother, and that they
understood her divided loyalties

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:09.890
between her mother
and her stepmother.

00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:12.050
Molly's dad went off to war.

00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:14.600
The children absolutely understood
that that was a metaphor.

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:18.570 position:56%
That was just another way of talking
about something that happened

00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:21.950
in their lives, too, when parents
went away or moved away or left

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:23.290
to find a job or something.

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:24.910
These young readers are sharp.

00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:28.300
They are sharp, and I believe
if the emotion is genuine,

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:30.770
the specific is less important.

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:33.060
I know, I myself, am not
particularly interested

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:35.260
in reading a story about
somebody who is like me.

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:38.430
Geez Louise, I spend
all day with me.

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:40.550
I would much rather read
about somebody else.

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:43.000
I'm taking a class, and
we read Madame Bovary.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.140
And you sit there, you read
Madame Bovary, and you say,

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:47.490
she's so much more of
a hot mess than I am.

00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:48.790
I love her.

00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:50.650
Oh, my gosh, and I mean,
Emma, that's fabulous.

00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:52.200
And then I sort of realized, yeah,

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:55.330
but you know how she's always
seeking out something new,

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:59.590
and she pursues, you know,
she marries poor Dr. Bovary,

00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:01.420
and then she's with
that guy, Rodolphe.

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:03.220
Anyone can see a mile away
that he was a bad bet.

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:06.050
And then here comes Leon,
and she spends all the money.

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:08.020
And you say, oh, gosh, you
know, she's just hopeless.

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:10.720
And then I thought, well,
yeah, but you know, don't I,

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:15.320
every single Monday morning of
my life say, okay, eat less,

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:17.810
exercise more, and clean
out a closet after dinner.

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:20.710
And then you after dinner, you
hear yourself saying, hey honey,

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:23.210
do have any fudge sauce
to put on this ice cream?

00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:25.720
So maybe Madame Bovary and
I are not that different.

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:27.910
We read books about people
who are different from us

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:29.380
to humble ourselves, you know?

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:30.740 position:56%
In addition to making us feel better

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:33.170
about ourselves, they
also humble us.

00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:35.780
And I think that's a very
important thing to do.

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:38.820
I think it's a self-fulfilling
prophecy and very dulling

00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:40.950
and self-defeating to say that
children only want to read

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:43.680
about children like themselves,
and worse, that the book had

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:45.170
to be written by somebody
like themselves.

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:49.150
That's how you end up in an
us/them mindset, I think.

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:51.080
That's why love historical fiction,

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:53.510
because it provides a
vicarious experience.

00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:57.710 position:56%
It's a way to hold on to the past,
travel to a place you've never been,

00:29:57.710 --> 00:30:00.790
learn about a world
beyond your own experience.

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:04.820
Emotion is the captivator, and the
driving force may be friendship.

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:07.020
Historical fiction can
present subtleties,

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:09.640
two sides or more, to a question.

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:13.090
The history has to be accurate
and authentic, and that's tricky,

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:15.530
because as Toni Morrison
says, "The past is not done.

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:16.830
The past is not over.

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:18.730
It's still very much in process."

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:23.890
And the past's very unfamiliarity
should not be diminished.

00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:25.190
Here's what -- guess who --

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:29.090
Anne Scott MacLeod has to
say about historical fiction.

00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:30.420
It's just fabulous.

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:34.560
She writes, "But people of the past
were not just us in odd clothing."

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:35.970
Isn't that great?

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:38.350
"They were people who saw
the world differently,

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:42.270
approach human relationships
differently, people for whom night

00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:47.330
and day, heat and cold, seasons
and work and play had meanings lost

00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:49.030
to an industrialized world.

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:53.200
Even if human nature is much the
same over time, human experience,

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:56.660 position:56%
perhaps everyday experience, is not.

00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:58.060
To wash these differences

00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:02.180
out of historical fiction is not
only a denial of historical truth,

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:05.910
but a failure of imagination and
understanding that is as important

00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:07.490
to the present as to the past."

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:08.790
Isn't that incredible?

00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:13.340
That was an article she wrote
for Hornbook Magazine in 1998.

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:17.930
So I always think, okay, the story
has to be intimate and infinite.

00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:23.990 position:56%
It has to be unique and universal,
but, as Pleasant always used to say,

00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:26.270
"The best book in the world is
useless if it's just sitting

00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:27.570
on a shelf gathering dust."

00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:31.150
And that's where librarians
and booksellers and teachers

00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:33.010
and you and I are all partners.

00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:36.850
You recommend a book or handy
book to a child, and when you do,

00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:39.810
I'm hoping it will consider
sort of deeper resonances.

00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:42.200
You know, go out on
a limb a little bit.

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:45.870
That brings us to assumption,
well, I called at four, but really,

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:47.950
it's sort of three-and-a-half.

00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:50.150
It's that I've sort out
on the skinny branches

00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:52.540
for a while because of Boys' Camp.

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:56.240
About five years ago, two really
great women, mothers of sons,

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:58.180
came to me and said, "You know,
we don't think books have done

00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:00.440
for boys what they did for girls."

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.540
Which is to say to girls,
you know, go for it.

00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:03.950
Pursue whatever your passion is.

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:08.310
Don't let anybody bully you are to
use you or cajole you out of that.

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:11.140
My Boys' Camp partners
and I didn't recognize,

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:15.280
and the books that we were reading
for boys, the boys that we knew

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:19.160
in real life who were adventurous
and kind and curious and quirky

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:21.490
and had rich interior lives.

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:24.610
The boys and the books didn't seem
to be full of promise and potential

00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:29.650
to grow up to be like the men
we knew and loved and respected.

00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:33.060
Men, as described by
Kenneth Rexroth,

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:35.770
in an essay he wrote
called The Mature Man.

00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:39.350
"The mature man lives
quietly, does good privately,

00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:42.340
assumes personal responsibility
for his actions,

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:44.750
treats others with
friendliness and courtesy,

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:47.660
finds mischief boring
and keeps out of it."

00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:48.960
Isn't that lovely?

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:52.440
And the statistics bear out that
men's rules are changing, as well.

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:55.520
The number of stay-at-home fathers
has doubled from 1.1 million

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:58.740
in 1989 to 2 million in 2012.

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:01.390
So Anne and Peggy and I wanted
to provide children with books

00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:05.120
about boys who are
likeable, brave, and thinking.

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:08.440
Don't think I'm being
altruistic here.

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:11.500
I want to, quite frankly,
better boys for girls

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:14.820
to share the world
worth and not boys,

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:18.320
as a recent New York Times article
classified men in movies and TV

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:23.110
as either mad, sad, or bad.

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:25.830
Remember that nurse who's going
to care for us in our dotage?

00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:29.230
Don't we wanted to be a man whose
thoughtful, empathetic, articulate,

00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:30.990
capable of self-control,
and patient?

00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:33.690
I'm not doing Boys' Camp out
of the goodness of my heart.

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:36.200
And if you want another kick in the
pants, it's a passé, it's outdated,

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:39.620
it's old fogey to think of
men and boys as doofus is

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:41.140
who can't express feelings.

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:43.540
I actually don't believe
in hardwiring.

00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:45.990
I believe in haywiring.

00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:50.500
Yep. Messy, open ended, changing
all the time, contradictory,

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:54.140
situational based, and there's
still plenty of work to be done

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:56.510
in countering what is
called the male gaze.

00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:57.810
Oh, my gosh.

00:33:57.810 --> 00:33:59.110
I was horrified.

00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:01.710
I went on Montgomery Public
School website to read

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:04.330
about this Curriculum
II that they're doing.

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:06.760
Nineteen children are illustrated.

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:08.150
Five are girls.

00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:11.300
Of those five, one's losing
a running race to boys.

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:14.540
One's being helped by a
bigger boy to hold a pencil,

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:17.560
and one has little
ruffles across her chest.

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:20.780
I mean, it made me just
want to burst into flames.

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:24.000
That brings us to assumption
number four.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.990
Speaking of bursting into flames,

00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:29.570
and assumption number four
is bummer books are honest.

00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:34.510 position:56%
I think it actually betrays in
anger, a resentment, the bitterness,

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:38.300
and even jealousy towards children
when we keep lowering the age

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:40.000
at which we depress them.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.300 position:56%
I'd like to challenge the assumption

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:43.450
that we're doing a
child a favor to do so.

00:34:43.450 --> 00:34:47.640
I believe in levels of
appropriate disclosure.

00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:49.780
I think, as writers, we
have a responsibility

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:52.660
to at least hint at redemption.

00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:56.900 position:56%
Otherwise, as readers and as
parents, we'll reap what we've sown,

00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:59.170
and otherwise, I think,
as readers and parents

00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:00.470
and teachers, we should be angry.

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:03.770
It's as if the author takes us for
a ride in a car, drops us off far

00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:06.140
from home, and leaves
there with no map.

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:07.440
It's lazy.

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:08.740
It's selfish.

00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:10.050
It's self-indulgent, and it's mean.

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:11.350
And though the world has changed,

00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:14.730
I think what our child
readers need has not changed.

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:16.280
They need to feel safe.

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:18.980
They need to feel loved
before they can feel free.

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:21.130
They need to feel supported.

00:35:21.130 --> 00:35:23.390
Not unchallenged but supported,

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:25.940
and what they reach should
celebrate being observant.

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:28.810
It should celebrate hope and
optimism in a cheerful skepticism

00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:33.030
that will lead them to challenge
assumptions, and you know,

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:35.590
I'm just going to say,
sarcasm is lazy humor.

00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:36.920
I don't think it's charming.

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:39.170
I think vulgarity is pitiful.

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:41.560
I think people laugh
out of embarrassment

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:42.860
and unease at things like that.

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:47.330
I think stereotypes are false
at best and murderous at worst,

00:35:47.330 --> 00:35:50.530
and we hobble children will
we teach them to be cynical.

00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:54.200
Cynicism is not the same
thing as critical detachment,

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:57.980 position:56%
and pessimism does not equal smarts.

00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:01.550
So I'm reading along and firing --

00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:03.750
I'm writing up the speech and
everything, and then you know,

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:07.040
at the end of the day, I
picked up American Childhood

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:12.920
by Anne Scott MacLeod, and get
to page 209, and she has written.

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:17.790
"Finally, when the awful weight
of negativism is measured,

00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:20.230
and the failures, disappointments,

00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:22.940
and betrayals in contemporary
children's books are tallied

00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:26.650
together, another observation
is hard to avoid.

00:36:26.650 --> 00:36:29.580
The literature is fundamentally
anti-child.

00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:33.050
Something in the eagerness of
the authors to acquaint children

00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:37.070
with all the terrors of
the contemporary world,

00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:39.860
their unwillingness to offer
any perspective or corrective

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:43.870
to puerile emotions, something
in the joyousness of the fiction

00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:46.440
as a whole, goes beyond
the requirements

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:50.400
of an unflinching realism,
designed, as its apologists claim,

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.240
to prepare children
for the real world."

00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:54.430
Holy smokes.

00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:56.040
How do you like that?

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.340
I'll tell you what.

00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:00.300
Anne Scott MacLeod, this
is why it pays to read.

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:05.260
The woman whose -- I'm giving
a speech in honor of her name,

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:08.310
has better -- expressed
more articulately

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:11.770
for myself exactly the
main point I want to make.

00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:15.070
It's fab -- it was
right there on page 209.

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:17.520
I was -- actually say with more --
I was a little timid, I thought.

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:20.340
But old Anne Scott MacLeod
right out there and unflinching.

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:22.620
She did not back away
from this at all.

00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:26.550
So she's saying to authors and to
people who give children books.

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:29.430
You know, shield the joyous.

00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:32.940
If the kid a chance, and I'm
going to say to those authors

00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:35.400
and writers, I think you're wrong.

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:37.500
I love this poem by Sheena Pugh.

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:38.860
It's called sometimes.

00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:43.340
"Sometimes things don't go,
after all, from bad to worse.

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:47.380
Some years, muscatel faces
down frost; green thrives;

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:52.540
the crops don't fail, sometimes a
man aims high, and all goes well.

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:56.550
A people sometimes will step back
from war; elect an honest man,

00:37:56.550 --> 00:38:00.910
decide they care enough, that they
can't leave some stranger poor.

00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:03.760
Some men become what
they were born for.

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:07.020
Sometimes our best
efforts do not go amiss,

00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:09.870
sometimes we do as we meant to.

00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:15.310
The sun will sometimes melt a field
of sorrow that seemed hard frozen.

00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:18.170
May it happen for you."

00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:22.090
Oh, now I have a Post-it note here
to myself that says "Aunt Max,"

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:24.010
and the reason why
have this Post-it note

00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:27.730
that says Aunt Max is it's
a reminder to me that now

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:30.040
that I've waxed so
eloquent and everything,

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:32.690
I did read your invitation,
and you were supposed to,

00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:37.990
I think it was listen, learn,
and enjoy, that I was invited

00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:42.220 position:56%
for my expertise, and I just wanted
to tell the story about my Aunt Max,

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:44.450
because it ties into expertise.

00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:47.860
When Aunt Max was 86-years-old,
the people who lived

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:49.980
in her retirement home were
invited to come and play

00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:52.040
with the orchestra of
an elementary school.

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:53.510
Aunt Max played violin.

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:57.180
So she was second chair, second
violin, with a fifth grade girl,

00:38:57.180 --> 00:39:00.580 position:56%
and at the very first rehearsal, a
woman in the front row, first chair,

00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:04.650
first violin, turn to Aunt Max and
her music stand partner and said,

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:07.450
"Now, if you don't know what to do,

00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:09.790
if there's something you don't
understand, just watch me.

00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:11.340
Just do what I do.

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:13.970
So Aunt Max and the little
girl said, yeah, okay.

00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:16.990
And after the first chair, first
violin lady turned around again,

00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:19.860
the little girl turned to
Aunt Max and said, "Show off."

00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:23.500
So I always like to tell
that story about Aunt Max.

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:25.080
So I'm not trying to show off.

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:29.860
I'm trying to sort of humbly
share with you the things

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:32.600
that I feel very passionate
about, and two things I'm sure of,

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:37.950
at least, and one is that we should
act as if, as C.S. Lewis says.

00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:41.520
We don't know, so what's to lose
by learning toward the good,

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:44.830
especially as we nurture
and fuel our young readers.

00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:49.620
And secondly, doesn't hope at
least deserve equal time, at least

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:52.460
and especially what
we give children?

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:54.070
Eleanor Roosevelt said
the most important word

00:39:54.070 --> 00:39:55.790
in the English language is hope.

00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:57.380
So I charge you to go forth

00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:00.280
and challenge the assumption
that reality is grim.

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:03.170 position:56%
Dysfunction is rife, and we're doing
children a favor by depressing them.

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:05.040
We're not.

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:09.730 position:56%
And in so say, I feel responsibility
to you, because if I were you,

00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:12.790
I'd be saying who is she again?

00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:16.540
What? Didn't she write
that book about Molly?

00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:18.870
What is she talking
about C.S. Lewis for?

00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:21.320
So I feel a responsibility
to you to tell you sort

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:22.620
of where this all came from.

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:25.830
So I'm going to share with you
a little project I've had going.

00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:29.770
I was raised as a Catholic,
and I majored in philosophy,

00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:33.710 position:56%
and the older I get, the more humbly
I accept my complete confusion

00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:35.620
on all matters religious.

00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:38.500 position:56%
But in an effort to get a
foothold, I'm -- here's my practice.

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:42.150
I'm looking for evidence
that the universe is benign

00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:45.910
or at least we're not totally
ridiculous to be optimistic.

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:49.810
And so I've come up with six, not
exactly proof, but six evidences.

00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:51.110
So see what you think of these.

00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:52.450
The first one is healing.

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:55.320
That people get better from
illness or from heartbreak,

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:57.350
as Emily Dickinson writes.

00:40:57.350 --> 00:41:00.900
"We grow accustomed to the
dark when light is put away,

00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:04.000
as when the neighbor holds the
lamp to witness her goodbye.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.450
A moment, we uncertain step
for newness of the night.

00:41:07.450 --> 00:41:11.220
Then fit our vision to the
dark and meet the road erect.

00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:14.470
And so of larger darkness is
those evenings of the brain

00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:18.290
when not a moon disclose
a sign or star, within.

00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:21.290
The bravest grope a little and
sometimes hit a tree directly

00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:25.780
in the four head, but as they learn
to see, either the darkness alters

00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:29.230
or something in the sight
adjusts itself to midnight

00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:32.150
and life steps almost straight."

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:33.640
So things get better.

00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:34.940
Things get better.

00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:36.920
My second evidence is forgiveness.

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:39.720
It's that moment when you
realize that the heat's gone.

00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:41.630
You're just not mad anymore.

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:43.440
In my third one is learning.

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:45.070
That it turns out no
matter how old you are,

00:41:45.070 --> 00:41:47.140
you can learn to do new things.

00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:50.190
I recently said in
a moment of weakness

00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:53.760
that I would write a mystery, and
I've loved writing the mystery.

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:58.590 position:56%
It turns out you can learn how to
do something new, and that's, to me,

00:41:58.590 --> 00:42:03.450
a lovely proof of the benigness
of the universe, and again,

00:42:03.450 --> 00:42:04.850
to quote Eleanor Roosevelt.

00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:06.890
"You must do the thing
you think you cannot do."

00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:08.350
And the more cheerful concept

00:42:08.350 --> 00:42:11.140
that I learned a while ago
called a Stendhal moment.

00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:12.440
That French author.

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:14.420
I don't know how to say his name.

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:16.380
Will have to learn how to do that.

00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:18.110
But that's a moment of sheer awe.

00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:22.120
You know that moment
where you go, I get it!

00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:24.900
You know, you're trying to
do something on your computer

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:28.230
or something, and you
think, I get it!

00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:32.820
I find that a very optimistic
signal from the universe,

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:35.410
and then the fourth thing
is growing, you know, trees,

00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:36.710
children, stuff like that.

00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:39.370
There's a lot of sorrow and
loss, of course, along the way.

00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:42.600
That's inevitable, but
growing and changing,

00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:46.000
we might as well see it is good,
because there's nothing we can do

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.030
about it, and it usually leads
children to independence.

00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:50.760
And the fifth thing is music.

00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:52.280
Inexplicable.

00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:55.770
And the sixth thing is the
discipline to just do the thing

00:42:55.770 --> 00:42:58.610
and get it done, which
if you're lucky,

00:42:58.610 --> 00:43:00.580
sort of transitions to absorption.

00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:05.970 position:56%
You know how you set and do work,
and you're just trying to, you know,

00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:09.110
get the meaning to come out
of the chaos, and really,

00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:12.740
all of you just wants
to go, I don't know,

00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:14.120
just walk the dog or something.

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:19.610
But then you stick at it, and
then sometimes, inexplicably,

00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:22.960
this sort of miraculous
immersion in concentration,

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:25.260
this whitespace happens, and
he looked out the window,

00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:26.780
and you think, gosh, it got dark.

00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:31.070
I mean, somehow you've made
that transition so that moment

00:43:31.070 --> 00:43:33.680
that you can't make
happen, but if you stick

00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:35.510
at it, sometimes does happen.

00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:40.210
That transition into immersion, to
me, also feels pretty miraculous.

00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:43.540
Now I'm toying with the idea of a
seventh thing, which is inventions.

00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:46.760
Like air-conditioning and
slow cookers as evidence

00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:49.310
that the universe is moving
in a positive direction,

00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:52.720
but that's very dicey,
because as Lily Tomlin says,

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:54.020
"I worry that the person

00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:56.390
who invented Muzak is
inventing something else."

00:43:56.390 --> 00:44:00.590
So I'm not really sure
we can add, you know,

00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:03.030
can really trust inventions.

00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:05.270
So you're saying, okay, you
know, thank you, Valerie.

00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:07.060
That's just so sweet.

00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:09.170
And you can cite to me,
you know, opposites.

00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:11.870
Illnesses, danger, but I
think that self-defeating.

00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:16.090
I think it stalls you to sort of
-- it just strands you on a morass,

00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:18.710
and I see an iceberg
of cold comfort,

00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:22.390
and maybe I'm optimistic
because, as I said before,

00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:26.120
the very act of writing for
children in and of itself is an act

00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:27.860
of hope and transformation.

00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:31.090
That out of chaos emerges
order in story.

00:44:31.090 --> 00:44:33.780
Clarity is not usually
present at the beginning.

00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:36.840
I'd be suspicious if clarity
did seem to be present

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:38.250
at the beginning of the process.

00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:43.110
It's a discovery, and the ideas
emerge from the mist over time

00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:48.440
with energy, focus, desire,
and discipline to make choices.

00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:50.790
I remember one time my
daughter saying to me, "Mom,

00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:52.770
write it right the first time."

00:44:52.770 --> 00:44:54.720
You know, see me write something
over and over and over again,

00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:57.420
and I wish I could write it right
the first time, but usually,

00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:59.790
it takes many iterations
to get the --

00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:04.210
to really be sure you're saying
what you really mean to say.

00:45:04.210 --> 00:45:07.660
So I believe we write for children,
we want to serve and respect them

00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:10.360
and to enrich the spot
where they are right now.

00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:14.260
You know, curious and goofy
and intense and cheerful.

00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:18.530
Children are, in their
lives, independent readers,

00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:22.040
and that's exactly where we want
to meet them and encourage them

00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:26.420
to go deep and linger there and
not to feel that they must rush off

00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:29.260
to any next stage of anything.

00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:33.600
We write to educate readers with
facts about, you know, animals

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:36.840
or history, and also, facts about
our shared culture in stories,

00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:39.150
all the while, respecting
the reader enough

00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:41.330 position:56%
to present multiple malleable views.

00:45:41.330 --> 00:45:46.440
We want them to challenge given
wisdom and challenge assumptions.

00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:48.340
When we write for children,
we want to teach them

00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:51.750
that we can love people with whom
we disagree, and we can disagree

00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:54.410
with people whom we love.

00:45:54.410 --> 00:45:56.940
We want to celebrate the values
of tolerance and compassion,

00:45:56.940 --> 00:46:01.940
as well as drive, hope, creativity,
individuality, change, and work.

00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:05.990
Work. We want to clue them into
the secret of life, which is --

00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:08.650 position:56%
you didn't know you're going to find

00:46:08.650 --> 00:46:10.220
out the secret of life
today, did you?

00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:12.920
Here, free of charge, here
is the secret of life.

00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:16.330
The purpose of life is to find
out the work we're here to do

00:46:16.330 --> 00:46:18.670
and do it, and I mean work.

00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:19.970
I mean service.

00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:23.350
I mean, pushing past the point of
pain when it's not fun anymore.

00:46:23.350 --> 00:46:26.970
It's like that Marge Piercy
poem, To Be of Use that goes,

00:46:26.970 --> 00:46:31.680
"The people I love best jump into
work headfirst without dallying

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:36.880
in the shallows and swim off with
sure strokes, almost out of sight.

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:39.600
The pitcher cries out
for water to carry,

00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:42.650 position:56%
and a person for work that is real."

00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:48.050
So those hopeful assumptions not
only underlie all that I write.

00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:51.350
They are also the view of life in
the universe that I want children

00:46:51.350 --> 00:46:55.750
to trust, and they lead to
specific ideas for stories.

00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:58.430
In fact, the smart ones of you
out there, which is, of course,

00:46:58.430 --> 00:47:01.670
all of you, have already
figured out that under the guise

00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:05.020
of giving you useful information,
I've actually just shown you

00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:08.600
and tried to validate
what I do and why.

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:13.540
So fellow lovers of the book, I
will end as I began by thanking you

00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:17.280 position:56%
by giving me the impetus and
inspiration to think about what I do

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:21.740
and why, and I will send you
forth with a sense of urgency

00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:25.080
about the moment we find
ourselves in right now.

00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:30.350
Urgency driven by our optimism
or/and challenges, not fear,

00:47:30.350 --> 00:47:33.790
but urgency all the same,
because at our backs,

00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:36.480
we always hear time's
winged chariot.

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:40.990
Or as Irma Bombeck
wrote, "Seize the moment.

00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:42.930
Remember all those
women on the Titanic

00:47:42.930 --> 00:47:44.730
who waved off the dessert cart."

00:47:44.730 --> 00:47:50.160
[ Laughter ]

00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:53.100
It gets funnier the
more you think about it.

00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:56.710
Or, as Rita Dove says in
her poem, Dawn Revisited.

00:47:56.710 --> 00:48:03.040
"The whole sky is yours to write
on, blown open to a blank page.

00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:05.130
Come on, shake a leg."

00:48:05.130 --> 00:48:06.930
Thank you.

00:48:06.930 --> 00:48:19.230
[ Applause ]

00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:20.530
Thank you.

00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:21.830
&gt;&gt; Thank you, so.

00:48:21.830 --> 00:48:23.130
I'm only going to be like a minute.

00:48:23.130 --> 00:48:25.740
I swear. Well, thank
you so much for that.

00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:27.060
That was just wonderful.

00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:28.880
And thank you so much
for your contributions

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:30.180
to children's literature.

00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:33.780
You know, it's really interesting,
listening to your talk brought back

00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:35.170
so many precious memories.

00:48:35.170 --> 00:48:36.920
You know, I mean, Kit, Felicity,

00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:38.810
and Samantha were part
of our family, frankly.

00:48:38.810 --> 00:48:41.460
You know, sisters, really,
to our three daughters.

00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:43.210
Right? And you know,
actually, and some days,

00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:46.810
I actually think they were the
preferred sisters to our daughters,

00:48:46.810 --> 00:48:50.440
frankly, you know, as we played
referee on many occasion.

00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:52.780
The American Girls, though,
weren't just friends.

00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:54.250
They were much more.

00:48:54.250 --> 00:48:58.480
They were a gateway to creativity,
to literacy and learning.

00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:00.620
They were inspiration to
all who read their stories

00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:05.120
and fostered a lifelong love of
reading, engagement, compassion,

00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:08.960
cultural awareness,
appreciation, excuse me,

00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:11.460
optimism, inquiry, and community.

00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:14.900 position:56%
I mean, it was a really a wonderful
set of stories that you could impart

00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:16.340
and share with your children.

00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:18.270
So thank you very much
for that contribution.

00:49:18.270 --> 00:49:20.330
It was wonderful to have that.

00:49:20.330 --> 00:49:22.370
We know for many studies
that multiple forms

00:49:22.370 --> 00:49:26.590
of literacy are essential for both
professional and personal success,

00:49:26.590 --> 00:49:27.890
and it starts from birth.

00:49:27.890 --> 00:49:29.190
Actually, even before, right?

00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:31.590
We read to children before
they're even born now.

00:49:31.590 --> 00:49:33.890
At the high school, we're
reinvigorating our focus

00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:37.270
on youth learning through new
initiative centered on reading,

00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:41.310
literacy and what we are
referring to YX for Digital Youth.

00:49:41.310 --> 00:49:43.740
As we spend the next year
re-envisioning the MLS,

00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:46.810 position:56%
a key part of that is an integrative
approach to youth learning,

00:49:46.810 --> 00:49:51.260
literature, literacy, designed
thinking, and digital media.

00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:55.330
Whether in a school, a public
library, the Library of Congress,

00:49:55.330 --> 00:50:00.960
Discovery, National Geographic,
Nickelodeon, PBS, or elsewhere,

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:04.500
our future begins with the
inspiration, love of learning,

00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:10.040
skills, and sense of accomplishment
that starts with reading.

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:11.340
You know one of the
stories I remember,

00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:12.640
you had all these great,
funny stories.

00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:13.940
I'm not as funny as you are.

00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:17.140 position:56%
But you know, one of the things that
you read about and sort of decry,

00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:19.900
I think, is apparent, is we've
taken away the small victories

00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:21.200
from children.

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:22.880
You know, like little
things like tying a shoe,

00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:24.180
because we start with Velcro.

00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:25.760
We take away all these
little things,

00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:28.730
and literacy is actually
a major victory.

00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:30.030
It's an accomplishment.

00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:33.270
Have you ever watched your
child with a first read?

00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:36.410
They can actually look at
those words and say sentences?

00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:42.030
It's amazing what happens when you
see a child getting that skill.

00:50:42.030 --> 00:50:45.130
We're bringing together
leading-edge research and practice

00:50:45.130 --> 00:50:49.010
of our library, education, and
human-computer interaction faculty

00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:52.180
to re-envision youth
learning, but we can't do

00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:55.620
that without the creativity
of Ms. Valerie Scott, frankly,

00:50:55.620 --> 00:50:59.670
or the research and dedication of
faculty such as Anne Scott MacLeod.

00:50:59.670 --> 00:51:03.000
We're building the future, the
next 50 years of the iSchool

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.680
on the foundation that
you have laid.

00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:07.510
Thank you very much.

00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:10.040
[ Applause ]

00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:12.970
So with that, I actually get now
the pleasure to turn it over to

00:51:12.970 --> 00:51:15.290
for questions for Ms. Tripp.

00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:16.620
Do we have any questions?

00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:17.920
Come on back up.

00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:20.500
I'm supposed to moderate, but I
think you'll be fine on your own.

00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:24.670
I don't really think that,
you know, [inaudible].

00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:27.810
So while she's coming up, let
me see if there any questions?

00:51:27.810 --> 00:51:29.730
Do we have a -- well,
it's a small enough room.

00:51:29.730 --> 00:51:31.030
All right, we'll start over there,

00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:32.350
and then we'll work our
way to the back, all right?

00:51:32.350 --> 00:51:34.510
So yeah, go ahead.

[ Inaudible Speech ]

00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:47.000
&gt;&gt; Valerie Tripp: For writing
the American Girl books?

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.170
&gt;&gt; Can you repeat the
question, please?

00:51:49.170 --> 00:51:50.470
&gt;&gt; Valerie Tripp: Where
did my inspiration

00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:52.280
for writing the American
Girl books come from?

00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:57.420
Initially, I think it came from
love of history, but daily,

00:51:57.420 --> 00:52:01.500
my inspiration comes from the
children I write the books for.

00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:05.530
I'm lucky enough to have a lot of
contact through Skype are going

00:52:05.530 --> 00:52:09.220
to Girl Scout troops or libraries
or schools or all different kinds

00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:11.250
of groups, and speaking
to the children,

00:52:11.250 --> 00:52:17.080
and they're very forthright about
giving me ideas, stories they would

00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:22.150
like me to write, and they are my
continuing source of inspiration.

00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:24.390
They inspire me, because
I always begin,

00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:27.080
no matter what period my character
lives in, and I always begin

00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:31.170
by thinking about my reader right
now today and what her life is

00:52:31.170 --> 00:52:35.660
like in 2014, and I'd like to think
of the story I write as a sort

00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:39.500
of a lovely, silky, satiny
ribbon of connection that starts

00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:42.440 position:56%
with her now and flows through time.

00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:44.560
It connects her to this
character that lived long ago,

00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:46.960
and that connection
can be through emotion.

00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:49.190
It can be through she
shared experience.

00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:53.770
It can be through hopes,
dreams, fears, but the integrity

00:52:53.770 --> 00:53:00.080
of that connection is the emotion
and the genuineness of the emotion.

00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:03.920
So it begins with my reader
and then, as soon as I figure

00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:06.870
out what her life would have
been like in the period of time

00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:09.830
that I'm writing about,
then I'm off and running.

00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:12.490
But the girls themselves, I have
to say, the girls themselves.

00:53:12.490 --> 00:53:13.790
Sometimes quite literally.

00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:15.970
A girl wrote me a letter and
said, "Okay, I just broke my arm.

00:53:15.970 --> 00:53:17.660
I want Felicity to break her arm."

00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:21.200
So I, okay, well, [mumbling]
bloodthirsty little thing.

00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:22.810
So I wrote a story about
Felicity breaking her arm.

00:53:22.810 --> 00:53:24.110
It was fabulous.

00:53:24.110 --> 00:53:25.660
Back then, they put like
leeches on your arm and stuff.

00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:26.960
It was great.

00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:30.270
So sometimes it's quite a direct
inspiration, and other times,

00:53:30.270 --> 00:53:32.850
it's more of a universal
sort of inspiration,

00:53:32.850 --> 00:53:34.370
but that's a great question.

00:53:34.370 --> 00:53:36.410
Way in the back, yeah, hi.

00:53:36.410 --> 00:53:40.550
&gt;&gt; Just kind of following
up on that question.

00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:42.130
As you wrote [inaudible],

00:53:42.130 --> 00:53:47.750
I'm wondering where you
conducted your historical

00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:49.050
research [inaudible]?

00:53:49.050 --> 00:53:50.600
&gt;&gt; Valerie Tripp: Where did I
conduct my historical research

00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:52.140
and how long did it take?

00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:55.800
That's a wonderful
question, because, really,

00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:58.850
the research turns
out to be your life.

00:53:58.850 --> 00:54:03.220
It's always there everywhere, just
the way everything I seem to read

00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:06.040
for the past eight months
contributed to what I wanted

00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:10.230
to say today in this talk, so,
too, this fabulous thing happens.

00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:13.100
When you begin to be
interested in a period of time,

00:54:13.100 --> 00:54:16.140
it turns out the whole world's
full of the information you need.

00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:18.180
You just need to start
paying attention.

00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:20.530
There was an article in the
Washington Post last week

00:54:20.530 --> 00:54:24.070
about how curiosity, you know,
is very good for learning

00:54:24.070 --> 00:54:26.700
because it makes you hang
onto pieces of information.

00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:32.450
So in some ways, I did my research
growing up in a house with parents

00:54:32.450 --> 00:54:33.980
who grew up during The Depression.

00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:38.240
And so I knew that my mother's
father had lost his job.

00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:40.590
They had to take in
borders to pay the rent.

00:54:40.590 --> 00:54:41.890
That she was a maid.

00:54:41.890 --> 00:54:45.770
That she couldn't go to college,
the college she wanted to go to,

00:54:45.770 --> 00:54:47.070
because there is no money.

00:54:47.070 --> 00:54:51.250
So the Kit story grew out
of the stories I lived with,

00:54:51.250 --> 00:54:56.500
and then in terms of the Samantha
stories, I knew that story

00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:59.410
because of my old pal,
Eleanor Roosevelt,

00:54:59.410 --> 00:55:02.420
with whom I was lucky enough
to fall in love when I was 11.

00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:05.110
So I read everything and still do
read everything I can get my hands

00:55:05.110 --> 00:55:06.500
on about her and her childhood.

00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:10.510
So I knew with that
childhood was like.

00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:14.290
Doing research is breathing.

00:55:14.290 --> 00:55:15.760
Doing research is breathing.

00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:19.520
When I was writing about Josefina,
my family and I went to New Mexico

00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:21.260
for about five summers in a row.

00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:23.960
I had one chair in the Southwest
reading room that I kind

00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:26.100
of started to think of his mine.

00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:28.760
If somebody else was in it,
I was kind of a little fussed

00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:30.060
about it, to tell you the truth.

00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:32.700
And then I would, you know, sidle
up to a lady in the grocery line.

00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:36.710
You know, hi, hi, and I try
to strike up a conversation

00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:40.220
and then try to wheedle my way
to be invited to her house,

00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:42.790
so that I can ask her, you know,
what did your mother tell you

00:55:42.790 --> 00:55:44.090 position:56%
that her mother had told her mother.

00:55:44.090 --> 00:55:46.420
Her mother was the most important
thing for somebody to know?

00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:49.710
So research is talking to
people and going places

00:55:49.710 --> 00:55:52.870
and trying things in
addition to reading.

00:55:52.870 --> 00:55:55.500
But I think it's just
being aware of.

00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:56.840
I think it's just being aware of.

00:55:56.840 --> 00:56:00.460
That said, I'm also lucky enough
that there are researchers

00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:02.740
at American Girl who can, and have,

00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:05.140
told me exactly how
much it would've cost

00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:09.690
to have a man's shirt dry cleaned
in December in Cincinnati in 1934.

00:56:09.690 --> 00:56:13.840
So there are researchers who can
answer very specific questions

00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:16.810
for me, as well, he and be
sure my facts are accurate

00:56:16.810 --> 00:56:18.510
and right on the money.

00:56:18.510 --> 00:56:21.020
But you kind of had to do research
to find out what you don't know.

00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:23.440
You know, you had to do
a lot of research to find

00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:26.430
out what questions you need to ask.

00:56:26.430 --> 00:56:27.730
So I love it.

00:56:27.730 --> 00:56:29.030
That's my favorite thing.

00:56:29.030 --> 00:56:30.330
[ Inaudible Speech ]

00:56:30.330 --> 00:56:31.650

so many times people started

00:56:31.650 --> 00:56:34.240
to mistake me for one
of the docents.

00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:38.290
Truly, so many times, and
you know, my daughter --

00:56:38.290 --> 00:56:40.980
our daughter was just
learned to walk at that time,

00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:43.350
and so the poor thing, I'd
swing her in a backpack,

00:56:43.350 --> 00:56:46.640 position:56%
drive down to Williamsburg, walk all
around, you know, and everything.

00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:48.670
She learned to walk at
Williamsburg, you know,

00:56:48.670 --> 00:56:50.370
pushing the stroller
in front of her.

00:56:50.370 --> 00:56:52.610
So yes, I went to Williamsburg,
many, many times.

00:56:52.610 --> 00:56:56.250
That's an enchanting -- that's
a very enchanting place to go,

00:56:56.250 --> 00:56:59.950
and that's a wonderful way to
gather impressions, as well.

00:56:59.950 --> 00:57:02.760
So in fact, just for my birthday,
just last month, my husband

00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:05.000
and I kind of cooked up this flimsy
excuse that we had to go back

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:08.460
to New Mexico, because I'm writing
that mystery about Josefina.

00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:10.400

in the atmosphere.

00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:13.170 position:56%
I mean, that was essential research.

Sure, so research is
whatever you want it to be.

00:57:31.070 --> 00:57:36.600
First of all, it's very humbling,
and I am embarrassed to admit

00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:39.830
that I thought, oh, you know,
I've been dealing with editor

00:57:39.830 --> 00:57:41.280
since I was 23 years old.

00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:43.110
I've been dealing with
editors for 40 years.

00:57:43.110 --> 00:57:44.670
So I know what it takes
to be an editor.

00:57:44.670 --> 00:57:46.300
No, I don't.

00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:50.200
Editing is a completely different
art, a completely different art,

00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:53.960
and it has been very
hard to learn how to --

00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:56.950
editors are like psychiatrists

00:57:56.950 --> 00:58:00.020
who help you say what
you really meant to say.

00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:03.230
They help you lead the life
you really meant to lead,

00:58:03.230 --> 00:58:07.910
and I turned -- I'm way
too hands-on as an editor.

00:58:07.910 --> 00:58:11.710
And has been a very difficult
task to learn how to say

00:58:11.710 --> 00:58:14.800
to a person I don't
understand this part.

00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:17.030
Could you do it again?

00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:20.130
It's also very, very hard for
me, because I know how hard it is

00:58:20.130 --> 00:58:22.740
to write a paragraph,
and I don't want --

00:58:22.740 --> 00:58:26.610
it pains me physically to ask a
writer to cut a paragraph out.

00:58:26.610 --> 00:58:28.110
You're thinking oh, my gosh.

00:58:28.110 --> 00:58:29.410
I know how hard it was to do.

00:58:29.410 --> 00:58:33.050 position:56%
Look at that fabulous metaphor she's
got going in there, and I just --

00:58:33.050 --> 00:58:35.530
I hate asking a person
to cut things.

00:58:35.530 --> 00:58:38.610
You have to be a little -- I don't
mind cutting my own stuff is much

00:58:38.610 --> 00:58:40.960
as I mind cutting things that
other people have written.

00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:44.900
So that is a very steep
learning curve, and it's like --

00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:49.710
not to mix my metaphors, but
it's the Myth of Sisyphus

00:58:49.710 --> 00:58:51.010
for me, that learning curve.

00:58:51.010 --> 00:58:54.150
That I get part way up and slip
right back to the bottom again.

00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:55.450
Very, very hard.

00:58:55.450 --> 00:58:56.750
Very hard to do.

00:58:56.750 --> 00:58:59.920
It has taught me to be
extremely grateful to my editors.

00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:03.870
I'm so grateful that they are
willing to dive into the muddy pit

00:59:03.870 --> 00:59:07.490
of my story with me and try
to help us both climb out.

00:59:07.490 --> 00:59:09.230
I'm very grateful.

00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:11.000 position:56%
So I've got a lot of learning to do.

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:12.740
Right here.

00:59:12.740 --> 00:59:20.480
&gt;&gt; Could you describe how the dolls
and the merchandise and the clothes

00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:22.710
and all of that, how that --

00:59:22.710 --> 00:59:24.010
&gt;&gt; Valerie Tripp: Works?

00:59:24.010 --> 00:59:25.400
&gt;&gt; Works together with the books.

00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:29.390
What's the chicken and what's
the egg, and how does that aim

00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:31.830
for the psyche of the child?

00:59:31.830 --> 00:59:34.840
You know, how that works together.

00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:38.040
&gt;&gt; Valerie Tripp: Yes, well,
one thing about for the psyche

00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:41.360 position:56%
of the child is that nobody has ever
really sort of combed the depths

00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:43.480
of the mystery of how the
child interacts with the doll.

00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:44.780
It's pretty cool, you know?

00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:47.650 position:56%
Sometimes you're the dolls mother,
and then sometimes you are the doll.

00:59:47.650 --> 00:59:49.040
Then sometimes you're
her best friend.

00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:53.570
It's very fluid, and so I
think that's a fabulous play,

00:59:53.570 --> 00:59:55.040
because that teaches you empathy.

00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:58.020
You know, you're becoming
someone else and trying

00:59:58.020 --> 00:59:59.710
to imagine how another
person would feel.

00:59:59.710 --> 01:00:01.840
So I think doll play is great.

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:03.140
The way it works with me

01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:05.810
for the stories is sometimes
one thing comes first,

01:00:05.810 --> 01:00:07.110
and sometimes the other.

01:00:07.110 --> 01:00:10.170
So I love to tell the story I
was just telling somebody before

01:00:10.170 --> 01:00:12.440
that with Kirsten, I
did a lot of research.

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:13.950
Kirsten's name is going
to be Rebecca,

01:00:13.950 --> 01:00:15.600
and she was going to be Norwegian.

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:17.570
So I did a lot of research
about Norway's, you know,

01:00:17.570 --> 01:00:20.460
getting into the food, everything,
and then one day Pleasant,

01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:23.400
who is the head of Pleasant Company
who started American girl called me

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:25.670
and said, you know,
hold the presses.

01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:30.280 position:56%
She said, "Rebecca has to be Kirsten
now, and she has to be Swedish,

01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:32.950
because I have found the most
adorable Swedish sweater."

01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:38.870
So, but then in the case of like
Kit, for example, I was able to say

01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:42.140
to the product developers, you
know, Kit wants to be a reporter.

01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:44.340
So you've got to make
a miniature typewriter.

01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:49.970 position:56%
So sometimes the story dictates what
the product will be, and sometimes,

01:00:49.970 --> 01:00:53.020
the product has a big
influence on the story.

01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:55.000
The appearance of the
doll is, of course,

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.440
very dependent on where she's from.

01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:59.490 position:56%
When we were writing about
Josefina, I had a board of advisors,

01:00:59.490 --> 01:01:02.790
and one of my advisors was a man
named Philippe Mirabal [assumed

01:01:02.790 --> 01:01:05.750
spelling], and Philippe they
cut off a chunk of his own hair,

01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:08.230
and we sent Philippe's
hair to the doll factory,

01:01:08.230 --> 01:01:11.710
so that we can see exactly what
color hair Josefina should have.

01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:13.810
So I always think that
Philippe a goes bald,

01:01:13.810 --> 01:01:15.600
we're just going to
buy a Josefina doll.

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:20.110
He just Scotch tape that hair
right back on top of his head.

01:01:20.110 --> 01:01:24.030
So sometimes the appearance and
the stuff about the doll has to do

01:01:24.030 --> 01:01:27.620
with where she's from and when
she's from, and then other times,

01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:31.530
it grows out of the story and who
she is and what her character is.

01:01:31.530 --> 01:01:33.650
And I always like to say
to children, you know,

01:01:33.650 --> 01:01:36.170
what Kit's father gives
her this typewriter,

01:01:36.170 --> 01:01:37.940
and when your parents
give you something,

01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:39.630
it's not just the object, okay?

01:01:39.630 --> 01:01:41.550
We've got to look at levels.

01:01:41.550 --> 01:01:44.410
It's not just a typewriter
Kit's dad is giving to her.

01:01:44.410 --> 01:01:47.860 position:56%
You saying to her, "I think it's
great that you want to be a writer."

01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:50.810
And when your mom drives you to
soccer, she's not just saying,

01:01:50.810 --> 01:01:52.110
"Yeah, good, I'm glad
you're playing soccer."

01:01:52.110 --> 01:01:55.190
She's saying, "You know, I'm really
proud of you for doing this."

01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:59.340
So every object has a reason
and a meaning and a depth

01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:04.370
and a significance and a symbolism
to it that supports the story,

01:02:04.370 --> 01:02:06.390
comes out of the story,
supports the story.

01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:11.670
It's very neatly intertwined,
and I also believe firmly

01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:15.120
in the synergy of story and object.

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:18.360
I think objects have sort of
energy in and of themselves,

01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:19.660
and when you interact with --

01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:23.500
that's what virtual will
never replace actual.

01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:25.130
That's why we like books.

01:02:25.130 --> 01:02:27.530
You know, we like that
weight of it in our hands.

01:02:27.530 --> 01:02:32.740 position:56%
We like the sensual interaction with
the object, and so I think that all

01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:36.400 position:56%
of the things that go along with the
books help the child lift the story

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:40.420 position:56%
up off the page and, you know, maybe
think of another ending for a book.

01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:44.310
Girls are writing to me all
the time saying, "You know,

01:02:44.310 --> 01:02:45.720
we get to Molly's birthday party.

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:48.980 position:56%
You need to tell us what kind of
cake she has at the birthday party."

01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:51.600
One girl said, "I personally,
the cake's my favorite thing."

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:53.150
So she wrote a paragraph.

01:02:53.150 --> 01:02:55.960
You know, she wrote a whole
chapter of Molly's party

01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:59.570
and she was interacting with
that doll and the plates

01:02:59.570 --> 01:03:03.660
and the whole thing to extend
that story the way she wanted to,

01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:06.110
which I was really thrilled about.

01:03:06.110 --> 01:03:08.410
So the objects are
sometimes inspiration,

01:03:08.410 --> 01:03:10.070
and sometimes they're inspired by.

01:03:10.070 --> 01:03:11.550
It goes both ways.

01:03:11.550 --> 01:03:15.660
&gt;&gt; Can you tell us a little bit
about the juxtaposition of writing

01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:20.120
for girls, which would feel very
natural, and then writing for boys?

01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:21.990
&gt;&gt; Valerie Tripp: You know,
as I said in my speech,

01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:27.240
I actually don't think that
at the heart emotionally,

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:30.040
I think the first thing
a child is as a child.

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:34.850
And I think that the task
of childhood is exploration

01:03:34.850 --> 01:03:38.930
and experimentation, and I think
that the important thing we have

01:03:38.930 --> 01:03:43.160
to say to any child is, you
know, go ahead and try it

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:44.460
and use your imagination.

01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:49.600 position:56%
And I don't really feel that
there's a difference in what we want

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:52.770
to encourage boys to do
and like and what we want

01:03:52.770 --> 01:03:55.470
to encourage girls to do and like.

01:03:55.470 --> 01:03:56.770
You know what?

01:03:56.770 --> 01:04:00.150
I've been thinking about this a
lot, and I think having just said

01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:03.320
in my speech that we don't always
write from our own experience,

01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:08.510
I think that growing up, I was
always -- you can see in that bio,

01:04:08.510 --> 01:04:14.400
I was always the tallest girl,
towering over the other kids.

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:17.000
I never got the sense of
myself as a, you know,

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.580
hothouse violet shrinking.

01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:21.870
You know, that I never had the idea

01:04:21.870 --> 01:04:23.730
that I couldn't do
anything that I tried to do.

01:04:23.730 --> 01:04:29.670
So I didn't get the message, I
guess, that girls were different

01:04:29.670 --> 01:04:33.370
for boys in their interests or in
what they were going to try to do.

01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:38.770
I actually believe, as I said, not
in hardwiring, but in haywiring.

01:04:38.770 --> 01:04:41.360
I believe that all of us are
all things at various times,

01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:43.660
and it shifts and changes
as we go through life,

01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:45.400
and thank goodness that it does.

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:49.030
&gt;&gt; Do little boys respond
to your writing about them?

01:04:49.030 --> 01:04:50.470
&gt;&gt; Valerie Tripp: They
like it a lot.

01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:51.890
Oh, yeah, they like it a lot.

01:04:51.890 --> 01:04:55.440
They think it's very funny,
and they like the adventure,

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:57.200
just the way girls like adventure.

01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:59.370
They like the human interaction.

01:04:59.370 --> 01:05:04.840
They are familiar with, you know,
personality conflicts and things.

There's no divide.

So I think we create that divide,

01:05:11.170 --> 01:05:12.910

a mistake to do.

One time, Addy was a new -- well, I

01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:10.480

signing in Falls Church,

mob caps to go around.

well the extra twin
can have my mob cap."

01:07:15.830 --> 01:07:17.130
&gt;&gt; No, girl.

01:07:17.130 --> 01:07:18.430
&gt;&gt; Valerie Tripp: Oh, girl.

01:07:18.430 --> 01:07:21.190
Yay, Sam! Oh, see I told
you there's no difference.

01:07:21.190 --> 01:07:22.490
Same yay, Samantha.

01:07:22.490 --> 01:07:25.540
&gt;&gt; I have a younger brother named
Joe, so we're both [inaudible].

01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:29.060
So when I was seven I wrote to
[inaudible] company and asked

01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:33.480
if they would consider
making American Boy books,

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:36.910
because my brother liked
reading American Girl books.

01:07:36.910 --> 01:07:38.210
So --

01:07:38.210 --> 01:07:39.510
[ Inaudible Speech ]

01:07:39.510 --> 01:07:41.310
&gt;&gt; Valerie Tripp: Well, I'm
grateful to you and Joe then.

01:07:41.310 --> 01:07:42.610
Thank you, Sam.

01:07:42.610 --> 01:07:43.910
So we're all finished?

01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:45.210
&gt;&gt; Lawrence Liff: I have
one more thing to say.

01:07:45.210 --> 01:07:46.510
&gt;&gt; Valerie Tripp: Oh, one.

01:07:46.510 --> 01:07:47.810
Okay.

01:07:47.810 --> 01:07:49.110
&gt;&gt; Lawrence Liff: Thanks.

01:07:49.110 --> 01:07:50.410
Hi everyone, I'm Larry Liff.

01:07:50.410 --> 01:07:51.710
I'm the Director of
Development, and my relation is

01:07:51.710 --> 01:07:53.010
to the College of Information
Studies.

01:07:53.010 --> 01:07:55.330
I'm so thrilled to see you all here
today, and thanks so much again

01:07:55.330 --> 01:07:57.070
to Valerie and the
Library of Congress.

01:07:57.070 --> 01:07:59.500
You know, the MacLeod
lecture is only made possible

01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:02.940
through the generosity of our
donors, and these are the alumni

01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:06.680
of the school, the faculty and
staff, the friends and colleagues

01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:10.200
of Anne, as well as people in
the community, who understand

01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:13.830
and share our value and the
importance of library education

01:08:13.830 --> 01:08:15.680
in the study of children's
literature.

01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:19.330
This lecture series is such a
wonderful tribute to Anne's work,

01:08:19.330 --> 01:08:23.430 position:56%
her deep passion for the subject,
but also, as a transformative figure

01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:26.460
in the scholarly significance
of the field.

01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:31.560
The mission of this lecture is
to educate a general audience

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:35.030
on different aspects of children's
literature, to share the expertise

01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:36.890
and knowledge of authors
and scholars,

01:08:36.890 --> 01:08:38.830
and isn't that where the
reasons that we write literature?

01:08:38.830 --> 01:08:43.930
To share our stories with a large
population and a great community?

01:08:43.930 --> 01:08:46.590

talk today and hope to come

01:08:46.590 --> 01:08:49.000
in future lectures,
we need your help.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.230
Philanthropic gifts are the sole
reason we can put this event on

01:08:53.230 --> 01:08:58.710
and the only way we can
continue to do so in the future.

01:08:58.710 --> 01:09:01.330

be found in your program,

01:09:01.330 --> 01:09:02.630
or you can come talk to me.

01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:06.440
If anyone is considering supporting
lecture, the college is going

01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:09.470
to be offering a copy of
Valerie's new book for anybody

01:09:09.470 --> 01:09:13.750
who didn't win one today to any
donor who makes a gift of $100

between now and October 18th,
