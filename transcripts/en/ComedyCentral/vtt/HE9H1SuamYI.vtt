00:00:01.101 --> 00:00:03.203
Last year, the town of Celeron,
New York was accosted

00:00:03.237 --> 00:00:06.974
by a monstrous, gobbler-of-souls
Lucille Ball tribute statue,

00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:09.843
which the townspeople
quickly named "Scary Lucy."

00:00:09.877 --> 00:00:14.081
-Aah! Aah!
-STELLING: Aah! Scary.

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:15.883
(laughter)

00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:18.085
Let me perform
in the club with you, Ricky.

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:19.520
(laughter)

00:00:19.553 --> 00:00:21.855
Aah!

00:00:21.889 --> 00:00:23.290
Now you may remember
that we launched

00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:24.992
to bring Scary Lucy here
to the <i>@midnight</i> stage,

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:27.895
which, coincidentally, is where
<i>I Love Lucy</i> was filmed.

00:00:27.928 --> 00:00:29.930
There first few seasons
of <i>I Love Lucy</i>

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:31.431
-were filmed right here.
-Right here.

00:00:31.465 --> 00:00:36.837
I feel like we are...
100% living up

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.505
(laughing): to the comedy legacy
of the show.

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:40.374
I can't even say it
with a straight face.

00:00:40.407 --> 00:00:42.476
I can't even say that
with a straight face.

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:44.645
Anyway, one of our fans
put this sign on her.

00:00:44.678 --> 00:00:46.713
Uh, "Let @midnight
have this statue."

00:00:46.747 --> 00:00:48.682
"Bring Lucy home"
was the hashtag.

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:50.817
We sent two of our guys
over there.

00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:52.085
They went
to a town hall meeting.

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:54.521
They were like,
"Can we have that?"

00:00:54.555 --> 00:00:56.590
-(laughter) -"Can we have
that horrifying thing

00:00:56.623 --> 00:00:58.458
that you can't
do anything with?"

00:00:58.492 --> 00:01:00.594
And they were like,
"Hmm, (bleep) off."

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:02.663
-(laughter)
-It's now a year later.

00:01:02.696 --> 00:01:06.567
They finally replaced Scary Lucy
with this new beautiful statue.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.635
This is Botox Lucy.

00:01:08.669 --> 00:01:09.903
(laughter)

00:01:09.937 --> 00:01:11.638
-I don't know if I like it.
-STELLING: It's better.

00:01:11.672 --> 00:01:14.107
-(applause and cheering)
-I don't...

00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:16.643
I get the feeling
that Botox Lucy

00:01:16.677 --> 00:01:19.179
is the kind of lady who would
body-shame Scary Lucy.

00:01:19.213 --> 00:01:20.447
It kind of feels like
there's a...

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.682
-Ugh.
-(laughter)

00:01:21.715 --> 00:01:23.684
They captured the feeling
of what it was like

00:01:23.717 --> 00:01:26.053
to be married to Desi, I think,
that's what happened.

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:28.288
-(laughter, groaning, applause)
-HARDWICK: Possibly so.

00:01:28.322 --> 00:01:30.123
Possibly so.

00:01:30.157 --> 00:01:33.760
That's a...
that's an historic burn.

00:01:33.794 --> 00:01:36.063
HARDWICK:
Now since

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:37.664
we tried to get the statue
from Celeron,

00:01:37.698 --> 00:01:39.433
and they wouldn't give it to us,

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:43.303
what can the horrifying Scary
Lucy statue be used for now?

00:01:43.337 --> 00:01:45.205
-Beth.
-Tim Burton's fluffer.

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:47.474
-HARDWICK: Yes. Points.
-(laughter, applause)

00:01:47.508 --> 00:01:48.976
HARDWICK:
Hari.

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.479
-Larry King's next wife.
-(laughter)

00:01:52.513 --> 00:01:55.716
(applause)

00:01:57.251 --> 00:02:00.053
HARDWICK:
Jason.

00:02:00.087 --> 00:02:02.089
Uh, drill a hole in its mouth.
I'll take it.

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:02.189
-HARDWICK: All right, points.
-Uh, no.
