00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.030
- [Instructor] A sociologist
studying fertility

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:04.480
in France and Switzerland wanted to test

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.390
if there was a difference in
the average number of babies

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.570
women in each country have.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.680
The sociologist obtained
a random sample of women

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:13.800
from each country.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.520
Here are the results of their test.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.010
So you can see a 100-person
sample from France,

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.660
a 100-person sample from Switzerland.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.840
They actually don't have
to be the same sample size.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.980
We have our sample means, our
sample standard deviations.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.160
You have the standard error of the mean,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.780
which for each sample
would be our estimate

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.466
of the standard deviation
of the sampling distribution

00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:37.780
of the sample mean.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.272
And here it says t test for the means

00:00:40.272 --> 00:00:43.010
of these different
populations being different.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.890
And just to make sure we
can make sense of this,

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.090
let's just remind
ourselves what's going on.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.640
The null hypothesis is
that there's no difference

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.206
in the mean number of babies
that women in France have

00:00:53.206 --> 00:00:56.090
versus the mean number of babies

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.240
that women in Switzerland have.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.560
That would be our null hypothesis,

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.150
the no news here hypothesis.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.620
And our alternative would
be that they are different.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.260
And that's what we have right over here.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.110
It's a t test to see if we have evidence

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.330
that would suggest our
alternative hypothesis.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.450
And so what we do is we
assume the null hypothesis.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.660
From that you're able to
calculate a t-statistic,

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.730
and then from that t-statistic
and the degrees of freedom,

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.680
you are able to calculate a p-value.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.050
And if that p-value is below
your significance level,

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.320
then you'd say hey this was
pretty unlikely scenario,

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.370
let me reject the null hypothesis,

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.140
which would suggest the alternative.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.590
But if your p-value is greater
than your significance level,

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.250
then you would fail to
reject your null hypothesis,

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.770
and so you would not
have sufficient evidence

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.260
to conclude the alternative.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.610
So what's going on over here?

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.725
You really just have to compare this value

00:01:48.725 --> 00:01:50.140
to this value.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.508
It says at the alpha is equal
to 0.05 level of significance,

00:01:53.508 --> 00:01:55.720
is there sufficient evidence to conclude

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.350
that there is a difference in
the average number of babies

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.940
women in each country have?

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.280
Well we can see that our p-value, 0.13,

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.400
is greater than our alpha value, 0.05.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.030
And so because of that,

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.220
we fail to reject

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.690
our null hypothesis.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.120
And to answer their question,

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.510
no there is not sufficient evidence

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.730
to conclude that there is a difference.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.800
There's not sufficient evidence to reject

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.053
the null hypothesis and
suggest the alternative.
