personally I grew up in a very

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590
personally I grew up in a very
 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.500
personally I grew up in a very
all-inclusive family that believed that

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510
all-inclusive family that believed that
 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.440
all-inclusive family that believed that
everyone is people we're all human and

everyone is people we're all human and
 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:36.760
everyone is people we're all human and

that way and I'm really really grateful
 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.270
that way and I'm really really grateful
for that upbringing because I've since

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280
for that upbringing because I've since
 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.280
for that upbringing because I've since

get under my skin because I genuinely

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490
get under my skin because I genuinely
 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.640
get under my skin because I genuinely
don't understand racism and that's

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650
don't understand racism and that's
 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.150
don't understand racism and that's
because I never was really exposed to it

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160

movies like this I have a hard time
 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.700
movies like this I have a hard time
connecting with it and that's why I am

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710
connecting with it and that's why I am
