00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.620
Prior to medicine, I worked for five years in business.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.020
And while it was interesting and I was advancing

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.020
in my career, it just seemed like a job.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.760
And what I'm finding now as I advance

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.400
in my emergency medicine career is

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.740
that it is not just a job,

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.060
it's something I get to do every day

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.840
that is a privilege,

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.600
and I get to serve my community

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.700
and people within our community

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.360
who don't always have access to care.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.160
I grew up in Atlanta, a little bit north of the city,

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.900
and my parents both came here

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.020
from India in the mid-60s.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.120
When I got to college, I sort of started down

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.200
the path of finance and economics and

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.680
really thought that someday I might

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.120
actually become a corporate attorney.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.580
So when I said, "I think I'm actually

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.660
going to pursue medicine,"

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.180
they were pretty surprised.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.660
I met my husband as an undergraduate here at Emory.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.980
We've been married seventeen years.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.220
We have two lovely girls,

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.680
one's four and a half, the other's two.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.700
I work clinically here at Grady, which is a wonderful

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.400
experience and very personally satisfying for me.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.120
I spend a certain part of my time every week working

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.340
at the School of Medicine as a small group advisor,

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.860
and so you develop this very wonderful

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.980
relationship with these students,

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.800
and not only do you get to spend time with them

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.300
teaching, but you also learn a lot about yourself.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.980
Something that I'm really passionate about is some

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.440
work that I do around screening patients for HIV.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.820
When I was in medical school

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.360
I actually took a year off

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.200
and lived in India for a year.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.500
And during that time I had the opportunity

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.920
to work with a physician in India who had

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.840
been taking care of HIV patients for over 20 years.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.540
In 2006 the CDC actually recommended

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.480
that all patients in acute-care settings

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.960
that are age 13 to 64 be tested for HIV

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.920
regardless of their chief complaint or risk profile.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.660
And then I had the opportunity to try and make routine

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.020
HIV testing part of what we do every day at Grady.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.720
It just seemed like it was the perfect fit for me.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.080
I work with a great team of individuals.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.100
We're currently working at 13 sites at Grady,

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.880
in the emergency department, in the walk-in clinic,

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.360
all the primary care clinics

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.980
in our six neighborhood clinics.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.940
The majority of them are now doing routine screenings.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.580
I'm proud to say that we have tested

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.400
over 80,000 patients and identified

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.020
over 500 new HIV diagnoses.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.300
One of the reasons I think

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.580
routine testing is so important is because

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.740
it de-stigmatizes the idea of getting an HIV test.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.680
It's just really a matter of treating patients

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.420
as if they're your family.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.080
And to let them know that

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.780
that's how you approach their care.
