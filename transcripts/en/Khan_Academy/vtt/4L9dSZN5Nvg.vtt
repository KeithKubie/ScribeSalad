00:00:00.148 --> 00:00:02.449
- [Voiceover] Let's say
that we had a function

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:05.743
defined by the infinite series

00:00:05.743 --> 00:00:09.953
so we're going to from
N equals one to infinity

00:00:09.953 --> 00:00:14.062
and each term is going
to be X to the N plus one

00:00:14.062 --> 00:00:19.062
over four to the N times N to the fourth

00:00:19.348 --> 00:00:20.729
and we could even expand this out.

00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:23.445
When N is equal to one this is going to be

00:00:23.445 --> 00:00:28.445
X squared over four
times one to the fourth

00:00:29.208 --> 00:00:31.384
so which is going to be four.

00:00:31.384 --> 00:00:33.943
When X is equal to two this is going to be

00:00:33.943 --> 00:00:38.173
X to the third power over four squared,

00:00:38.173 --> 00:00:42.637
four squared times two to the fourth power

00:00:42.637 --> 00:00:46.740
and we know this of course is 16 times 16

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.887
which would be 256 but I'll
just leave it like that for now.

00:00:49.887 --> 00:00:53.957
Plus when X is three, this is
going to be X to the fourth

00:00:53.957 --> 00:00:58.957
over four to the fourth power
times four to the fourth

00:00:59.878 --> 00:01:03.062
times four to the fourth
which is really going to be

00:01:03.062 --> 00:01:07.334
four to the eighth power
and we'll just keep going on

00:01:07.334 --> 00:01:09.329
and on and on just to get a sense

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:11.446
of what this function would look like.

00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:15.109
This function that's
defined by infinite series.

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:19.428
Now what I'm curious
about is for what X values

00:01:19.428 --> 00:01:24.385
will this function
converge to finite values

00:01:24.385 --> 00:01:26.485
or another way of thinking
about it let's come up

00:01:26.485 --> 00:01:28.444
with the radius of convergence

00:01:28.444 --> 00:01:32.132
or the interval of
convergence for this function.

00:01:32.947 --> 00:01:36.227
Now since we've just been
talking about the ratio test

00:01:36.227 --> 00:01:37.987
you might say, "Well, maybe
the ratio test is useful."

00:01:37.987 --> 00:01:41.325
For what X values is this
thing going to converge

00:01:41.325 --> 00:01:42.916
so let's apply the ratio test.

00:01:42.916 --> 00:01:47.916
Let's take the limit, the
limit as N approaches infinity

00:01:49.026 --> 00:01:54.026
of the absolute value
of the N plus oneth term

00:01:55.747 --> 00:01:58.475
over the Nth term.

00:01:58.475 --> 00:02:01.443
For this particular case
this is going to be the limit

00:02:02.443 --> 00:02:06.911
as N approaches infinity
so the N plus oneth term,

00:02:06.911 --> 00:02:09.361
I'll do this in orange so it'll be

00:02:09.361 --> 00:02:11.983
X to the N plus one plus one.

00:02:11.983 --> 00:02:16.983
So it's going to be X to the N plus two,

00:02:17.297 --> 00:02:21.649
over four to the N plus one,

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:24.882
times N plus one to the fourth power

00:02:24.882 --> 00:02:28.399
and we're going to divide
that by the Nth term

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:32.861
which is just going to
be X to the N plus one

00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:37.861
over four to the N times N to the fourth

00:02:38.492 --> 00:02:40.635
which of course is going
to be the same thing

00:02:40.635 --> 00:02:45.340
as the limit as N approaches infinity of,

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.803
I can just copy and paste this, of this

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:53.879
so copy and paste that times
the reciprocal of this.

00:02:55.333 --> 00:02:58.090
We're dividing by a rational expression,

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.990
that's the same thing as
multiplying by the reciprocal.

00:03:01.728 --> 00:03:06.728
Times four to the N, N to the fourth

00:03:07.186 --> 00:03:11.558
over X to the N plus one power.

00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:14.446
Actually let me just clean
this up a little bit.

00:03:14.446 --> 00:03:16.318
I can re-simplify this.

00:03:16.318 --> 00:03:20.285
Well X to the, let me
get another color here

00:03:20.285 --> 00:03:25.285
so X to the N plus two divided
by X to the N plus one,

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:29.850
well N plus two minus N plus
one is just going to be one

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.109
so this is just going to simplify
to an X in the numerator.

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:36.734
Then let's see, four to the N divided by

00:03:36.734 --> 00:03:40.275
four to the N plus one so
this is the same thing as,

00:03:40.275 --> 00:03:42.456
this is the same if we divide
the numerator and denominator

00:03:42.456 --> 00:03:44.839
by four to the N, this is going to be one

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:47.916
and this is just going to be a four.

00:03:47.916 --> 00:03:50.660
This is going to simplify
to, I don't know,

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.981
I forgot my absolute value
signs, don't want to do that

00:03:52.981 --> 00:03:56.316
so let's keep my absolute value signs here

00:03:56.316 --> 00:03:57.334
the whole time.

00:03:57.334 --> 00:04:00.198
This is going to be equal to the limit

00:04:00.198 --> 00:04:05.198
as N approaches infinity
of the absolute value of,

00:04:06.215 --> 00:04:09.141
we're going to have X, N to
the fourth in the numerator

00:04:09.141 --> 00:04:10.804
so let me write that down.

00:04:10.804 --> 00:04:15.088
We're going to have X times N
to the fourth in the numerator

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:17.562
and in the denominator
I'm going to have four

00:04:17.562 --> 00:04:19.651
times N plus one to the fourth.

00:04:19.651 --> 00:04:20.820
Well what's that going to be?

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.820
Well if you expand out N
plus one to the fourth,

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.681
it's going to be N to the fourth

00:04:27.681 --> 00:04:29.203
plus a bunch, a bunch of terms

00:04:29.203 --> 00:04:31.614
and a bunch of lower degree terms,

00:04:31.614 --> 00:04:33.038
this is going to be highest degree term

00:04:33.038 --> 00:04:34.145
so if you distribute the four,

00:04:34.145 --> 00:04:35.452
it's going to be four N to the fourth

00:04:35.452 --> 00:04:37.523
plus a bunch of lower degree terms.

00:04:37.523 --> 00:04:40.991
Let me write it that
way so it's over four,

00:04:40.991 --> 00:04:42.767
I'll use the same colors.

00:04:42.767 --> 00:04:46.944
Four N to the fourth,

00:04:46.944 --> 00:04:49.880
plus a bunch of lower degree terms.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.300
Now, what's the limit as N
approaches infinity here?

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.667
Well, we have the same,

00:04:54.667 --> 00:04:56.674
we want to look at the
highest degree terms.

00:04:56.674 --> 00:04:58.011
We want to look at the N to the fourth,

00:04:58.011 --> 00:04:59.475
the fourth degree terms

00:04:59.475 --> 00:05:01.778
and so it's really going to
be the coefficient on this

00:05:01.778 --> 00:05:03.774
and one way to think about it
if you divide the numerator

00:05:03.774 --> 00:05:06.115
and the denominator
both by N to the fourth,

00:05:06.115 --> 00:05:07.760
these are the only terms,

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.838
you're going to have an X in the numerator

00:05:09.838 --> 00:05:11.181
and the denominator
you're going to have four

00:05:11.181 --> 00:05:13.061
and all these others
terms are going to divided

00:05:13.061 --> 00:05:14.501
by some power of N.

00:05:14.501 --> 00:05:16.749
As your limit approaches,
as N approaches infinity

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:17.953
all the other terms are going to zero

00:05:17.953 --> 00:05:18.822
and all you're going to have left

00:05:18.822 --> 00:05:21.582
in the denominator is a
four and X in the numerator.

00:05:21.582 --> 00:05:25.676
This right over here, the
limit as N approaches infinity

00:05:25.676 --> 00:05:27.402
is going to be X over four

00:05:27.402 --> 00:05:30.226
or I should say the absolute
value of X over four.

00:05:31.026 --> 00:05:33.682
It's going to be equal
to the absolute value

00:05:33.682 --> 00:05:38.682
of X over the absolute
value of X over four.

00:05:39.587 --> 00:05:42.726
Now we can apply the ratio test

00:05:42.726 --> 00:05:44.065
or I guess we're always applying him

00:05:44.065 --> 00:05:46.676
but now we can really test,
do the test part of it

00:05:46.676 --> 00:05:48.379
and the ratio test tells us

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:50.178
that if this limit right over here,

00:05:50.178 --> 00:05:54.435
as long as it evaluates to something

00:05:54.435 --> 00:05:59.435
that is less than one, then
our series will converge.

00:06:00.936 --> 00:06:03.626
We just have to say that this
expression right over here

00:06:03.626 --> 00:06:04.884
has to be less than one.

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:08.789
Our function is going to
converge to finite values

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:10.785
as long as the absolute
value of X over four

00:06:10.785 --> 00:06:15.785
is less than one and this is
dividing the absolute value of,

00:06:16.481 --> 00:06:17.910
or the absolute value of X over four

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.083
is going to be the same thing
as the absolute value of X

00:06:20.083 --> 00:06:22.997
divided by four so it's four is positive

00:06:22.997 --> 00:06:24.576
so that just has to be less than one.

00:06:24.576 --> 00:06:26.575
Multiply both sides by four,

00:06:26.575 --> 00:06:28.694
won't change the equality
since four is positive

00:06:28.694 --> 00:06:30.515
so you're going to have
the absolute value of X

00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:32.545
has to be less than four.

00:06:32.545 --> 00:06:36.522
Just like that we have defined
the radius of convergence.

00:06:36.522 --> 00:06:39.695
This right over here is
the radius of convergence

00:06:39.695 --> 00:06:42.107
for our function or for
our infinite series,

00:06:42.107 --> 00:06:45.143
radius of convergence.

00:06:45.143 --> 00:06:47.327
Or if we wanted to write
that same information

00:06:47.327 --> 00:06:50.110
as an interval of
conversions, we would say

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:54.706
that X has to be less than four

00:06:54.706 --> 00:06:56.800
or greater than negative four.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.877
This is the same
information right over here,

00:06:58.877 --> 00:07:03.877
express this way, this is
the interval of convergence.

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:12.852
These are the X values for which
this original function here

00:07:12.852 --> 00:07:16.667
is going to converge to finite values.
