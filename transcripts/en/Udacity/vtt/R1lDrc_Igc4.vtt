00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I want to describe this next result just because it just shows how weird

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
computational complexity results can be.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Let's think about the colorability of planar graphs. In particular, here's a decision problem.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We're given a graph G and a number K. Is planar graph G K colorable?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And let's look at how the difficulty of the question differs as we change K. So K is 1.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
What kind of graphs are K colorable? Graphs with no edges.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So we can answer this question in constant time if the number of edges is greater than 0, no.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
As soon as there is a single edge, then you're going to need to two colors to color the nodes in that.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
All right. What if it's two? We want to know if this graph two colorable.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
We'll you know this one already because two colorability is exactly the same as testing

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
whether the graph is bipartite and in the previous unit, you showed that that could be solved

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
with depth-first search and therefore, runs in big Î˜(n+m).

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
In case three, well 3 colorability we showed was NP complete,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
but we didn't do that for planar graphs, we did that for general graphs.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
but it turns out that you can actually introduce another gadget into the mix here

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
that actually let you deal with edge crossings.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So if you have a piece of the graph that looks like this and there's a crossing in it,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
you can actually introduce some nodes here so that the information from this node travels along

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and gets to this node without ever having to cross another edge.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
It becomes a planar graph. I didn't explain how to do this but it turns out to be true.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
A three coloring of planar graph isn't any easier

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
than three coloring in general graph, it's NP complete.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
What about coloring a graph with four colors if its a planar graph.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Well, remarkably, the problems gotten harder and harder from constant to linear

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
to basically it seems like it requires exponential time, it goes back to constant time,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and that's because of the celebrated 4-color map theorem that says that any map

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
can be colored with four colors and in this particular case, any map can be translated

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
into a planar graph and so we know that every planar graph can be colored with four colors.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So the constant time algorithm for this problem is just to always say yes.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
You give me a graph and tell me this is planar and I say, "Yup, it's four colorable,"

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and therefore, it's also going to be five, six, seven colorable because you can just use the first four.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.000
So that's kind of cool. So one of the things to point out is that the peak of the hardness comes at K=3.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
That actually shows up a lot in NP complete problems.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Usually if there's two of something that you have to choose from,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
the problem is pretty easy because you can try one of them

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and if it doesn't work try the other one right away, but when if there's three,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
you have to keep considering lots of different combinations of things and

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
the difficulty level really, really blows up.
