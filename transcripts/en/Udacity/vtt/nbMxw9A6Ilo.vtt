00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.680
When we talked about configuration, we alluded to design.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.310
Design is a very wide ranging, open ended activity. But then we settled on to

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.460
configuration, very routine kind of design, where all the parts of the design

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.950
are already known, we simply have to figure out the configuration of the parts.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.330
It is time now to return to design thinking. What is design thinking?

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.100
Design thinking is about thinking about ill-defined, underconstrained,

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.540
open ended problems. Let's a design a house that is sustainable is an example of

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.320
design thinking. Sustainability here is ill-defined. The problem is open ended.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.170
In design thinking, it is not just that a solution that evolves,

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.530
it is that the problem it was as well. We have problem, solution, coevolution.
