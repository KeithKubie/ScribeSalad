00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:06.460
There are so many ways to be unhappy in love,
but one kind which modern psychology has given

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:12.780
particular attention to are relationships,
very high in number, in which one of the parties

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:20.391
is defined as avoidant in their attachment
patterns – and the other as anxious. Attachment

00:00:20.391 --> 00:00:26.070
Theory is the term given to a set of ideas
about how we love and the role of childhood

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.980
therein originally developed by the English
psychologist John Bowlby in the 50s and 60s.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.920
It divides up humanity into three categories
according to our varying capacity to behave

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:45.100
with confidence and trust in relationships.
Firstly, there are those who are securely

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:51.640
attached, who had reliable and good childhood
experiences and now expect to be positively

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.640
treated by those they love, fortunate types
who are capable of empathy and generosity

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.770
– and communicate with honesty and directness
about their needs. Around 50% of the population

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:12.790
is assumed to be securely attached. This leaves
two fascinating deviations from health, caused

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:19.170
by some form of early parental letdown and
trauma: the first kind of attachment pattern

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.990
is known as Avoidant, the second as Anxious.
What makes things even more complicated and

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.470
very combustible is that Avoidant and Anxious
people are frequently drawn to forming couples

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.330
(it’s part of their pathology) where their
varied emotional quirks contribute to an especially

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.110
fraught combination. An Anxiously attached
person in a relationship will have the characteristic

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:50.220
feeling of not being properly appreciated
and loved. They would – they tell themselves

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.830
– like so much more closeness, tenderness,
touch and sex – and are convinced that such

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.190
a union could be possible. The person they
are with, however, seems to them humiliatingly

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:08.190
and hurtfully detached. They never seem to
want them with as much intensity as they offer

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.830
them. They are hugely saddened by their coldness
and distance and gradually fall into moods

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:20.349
of self-loathing and rejection, feeling unappreciated
and misunderstood, as well as vengeful and

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:26.599
resentful. For a long time, they might keep
quiet about their frustrations until eventually

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:32.940
desperation erupts. Even if it is a very inappropriate
moment (perhaps they and their partner are

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.870
exhausted and it’s past midnight), they
won’t be able not to insist on addressing

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.709
the issues right now. Predictably, these sort
of fights go very wrong. The anxious lover

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.769
loses their calm, they exaggerate and drive
their points home with such viciousness that

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.799
they leave their partner convinced that they
are mad and mean. Related image A securely

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:59.549
attached partner might know how to soothe
the situation, but an avoidant one certainly

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:05.641
doesn’t. Tragically, this avoidant party
triggers every insecurity known to their anxious

00:03:05.641 --> 00:03:11.120
lover. Under pressure to be warmer and more
connected, the avoidant partner instinctively

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.829
withdraws and feels overwhelmed and hounded.
They go cold – and disconnect from the situation

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:23.069
only further ramping up the partner’s anxiety.
Underneath their silence, the avoidant one

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:28.510
resents feeling, as they put it, ‘controlled’;
they have the impression of being got at,

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.829
unfairly persecuted and disturbed by the other’s
‘neediness’. They may quietly fantasise

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:38.969
about going off to have sex with someone else
completely, preferably a total stranger or

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:44.780
of going into the other room and reading a
book, but probably not one about psychology.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:51.200
It helps immensely to know that this is not
your relationship only, it’s a type and

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.419
there are – quite literally – millions
of them unfolding on the planet at any point.

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:01.770
Even better, the causes of the distress, which
feel so personal and so insulting, are in

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:09.069
fact general phenomena, well studied and mapped
by sober researchers in lab coats. The solution,

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:15.559
as ever, is simply knowledge. There is an
immense difference between acting out on one’s

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:21.729
avoidant or anxious impulses – and, as would
be preferable, understanding that one has

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:27.430
them, grasping where they came from and explaining
to ourselves and others why they make us do

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:34.120
what we do. We cannot – most of us – be
wholly healthy in love, but we can be something

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:40.940
almost as beneficial: we can grow into people
committed to explaining our unhealthy, trauma-driven

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:47.900
behaviour in good time, before we have become
overly furious and hurt others too much – and

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.300
apologising for our antics after they have
run their course. There are few things more

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.610
romantic, in the true sense, than a couple
who have learnt to tell one another with wit

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:04.020
and composure that they have been triggered
in an avoidant or an anxious direction, but

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.280
are doing everything they can to get on top
of things – and hope to be normal again

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.560
in a little while.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:33.920
