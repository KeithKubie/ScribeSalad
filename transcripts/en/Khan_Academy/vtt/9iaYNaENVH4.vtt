00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.160
So I've drawn multiple versions
of the exact same surface

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.790
S, five copies of that
exact same surface.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.060
And what I want to do is think
about the value of the line

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.320
integral-- let me write this
down-- the value of the line

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:22.840
integral of F dot dr, where F
is the vector field that I've

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.920
drawn in magenta in
each of these diagrams.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.802
And obviously, it's different
in each of these diagrams.

00:00:27.802 --> 00:00:30.010
And the only part of the
vector field that I've drawn

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.560
is a part that's
along the surface.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.410
I could have drawn the
part of the vector field

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.870
that's off the
surface, but we're only

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.390
going to be concerned with
what's going on on the surface.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.960
So the vector field
could be defined

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.080
in this entire three-dimensional
space in here as well.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.080
And these are obviously
different vector fields,

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.060
and we can see that visually
based on how we drew it.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.070
And the contour that we
care about-- remember,

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.444
we're going to take a line
integral, so the path matters.

00:00:51.444 --> 00:00:55.530
The path that we care about is
the counterclockwise boundary

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.110
of our surface, so it's going
to be this right over here.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.210
The counterclockwise
boundary of our surface

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.965
is what we're going to
be taking F dot dr along.

00:01:06.965 --> 00:01:09.514
So this right over here, and
let me draw the orientation.

00:01:09.514 --> 00:01:10.930
It's going to be
counterclockwise.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.730
And we're going to do it in
every one of these situations,

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.520
for every one of these surfaces
and every one of these F's.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.520
And what I really want to think
about is how the value of F

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.110
dot dr over that
contour, how it might

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.714
change from example to example.

00:01:27.714 --> 00:01:29.130
And obviously, the
only difference

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.230
between each of these is what
the vector field F is doing.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.180
So first let's think about
this example right over here.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.540
At this part of the
contour, this bottom part

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.450
right over here,
our vector field

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.160
is going in the exact same
direction as our line,

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.620
as our contour.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.474
So we're going to get positive
values of F dot dr down here,

00:01:50.474 --> 00:01:52.140
and we're going to
keep summing them up.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.550
We're taking an integral.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.910
Then as we go up
the curve or as we

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.520
go kind of uphill
right over here,

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.180
we see that our vector field is
going essentially orthogonal.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.580
It's going perpendicular.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.760
It's going perpendicular
to our contour.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.610
So our F dot dr, we're not going
to get any value from that.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.665
F dot dr and all of these,
this part of the contour,

00:02:11.665 --> 00:02:13.300
it's all going to be 0.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.770
So we're not going to get
anything right over there.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.640
Actually, let me
just write nothing.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.020
So we get nothing
right over there.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.060
Maybe I'll write 0.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.270
I'll write we'll get
0 right over there.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.320
And then up here, when we're
at this part of the contour,

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.580
our vector field is going in
the exact opposite direction

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:32.430
as our path.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.247
Up here our path
is going, I guess,

00:02:34.247 --> 00:02:36.330
from the right to the left,
while our vector field

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.200
is going from the
left to the right.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.330
And so we're actually going
to get negative values.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.500
We are going to get
negative values up here,

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.700
and they're going to sum up to
a reasonable negative value.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.030
And if the vector
field is constant,

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.900
and I kind of drew
it like it is,

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.590
and if this length is
equal to this length,

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.870
then these two values
are going to cancel out.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.900
When you add this positive
sum to this negative sum,

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.520
they're going to be 0.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.570
And then once again, when
you go downhill again,

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.410
the vector field
is perpendicular

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.550
to our actual path, so
we're going to get 0.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.640
So based on the way
I've described it,

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.140
your line integral of F dot
dr for this version of F

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.090
in this example right over
here, it might all cancel out.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.780
You will get something, if we
make the assumptions that I

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.400
made, this might be equal to 0.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:31.280
So in this example, F dot
dr could be equal to 0.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.670
Now let's think about what's
going on in this situation.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.240
In this one, just like the last
one, as we go along the bottom,

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.980
the vector field is going
in the exact same direction

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.020
as our contour, so we're
going to get positive values.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.400
And once we go up the
hill, the vector field

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.992
is going perpendicular
to our path,

00:03:46.992 --> 00:03:48.950
so it's not going to add
anything really to it.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.290
So we're just going to
get 0 along this part.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.250
But then up here, our vector
field has switched directions.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.200
And once again, it's going
in the exact same direction

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.550
as our path, so we're going to
get more positive values right

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:01.380
over there.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.220
And then as we go
down here, it's

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.570
not going to add anything
because our vector field is

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:06.695
perpendicular to our path.

00:04:06.695 --> 00:04:08.270
So we're going to get 0.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.994
But notice, now these
two ends don't cancel out

00:04:11.994 --> 00:04:12.660
with each other.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.100
We're going to get
a positive value.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.470
We are going to get
a positive value.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.660
And what was the difference
between this version

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.310
of F, this vector field,
and this vector field

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.360
right over here?

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.530
Well, this vector field
switched directions

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.130
so that the top part
didn't cancel out

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.210
with the bottom part.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.680
Or another way to think about
it is, it had some curl.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.480
There's a little bit
of spinning going on.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.210
If this was describing
the velocity of a fluid,

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.490
and if you were to put
a stick right over there

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.810
on the surface, the
stick would spin.

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.610
It has some spin or
some curl, however

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:44.610
you want to describe it.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.542
This right over
here has no curl.

00:04:46.542 --> 00:04:48.000
If you put a stick
right over here,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.710
it would just flow
with the fluid,

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.130
but the stick itself
would not spin.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.660
So we got a positive value
for the line integral

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:55.530
in this situation.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.130
And we also have, it looks
like, a positive curl.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.710
Now let's think about this one.

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.270
In this situation, as we go
along this part of our contour,

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.000
our vector field F is going
in the exact same direction,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.820
so we're going to
get positive values.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.600
Now as we go uphill,
our vector field F,

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.780
it's also kind of turned
in that direction,

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.090
and so we'll get
more positive values.

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.390
And now as we go
in that direction,

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:26.797
our vector field
F is still going

00:05:26.797 --> 00:05:28.380
in the direction of
our contour, we're

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.260
going to get more
positive values.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.557
And as we go down, once
again the vector field F

00:05:32.557 --> 00:05:34.265
is going in the
direction of our contour,

00:05:34.265 --> 00:05:36.660
so we'll get even
more positive values.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.860
So in this situation, the
value of our line integral of F

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.590
dot dr is even more positive.

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.797
And we see that the
actual vector field along

00:05:50.797 --> 00:05:52.630
the surface-- and
remember, the vector field

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.005
might be doing all sorts of
crazy things off the surface.

00:05:55.005 --> 00:05:57.740
Actually, let me draw that
in that same magenta color.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.240
It might be doing all sorts of
crazy things off the surface,

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.864
but what we really
care about is what's

00:06:01.864 --> 00:06:02.940
happening on the surface.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.037
And because this
vector field is,

00:06:05.037 --> 00:06:06.620
I guess you could
say curling, or it's

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.050
spinning along the
surface, it allows

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.540
it to go with the boundary
along all the points,

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.590
and we get a very positive
value for this line integral.

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.170
So we have a higher curl.

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:22.750
So more curl, it looks like, is
leading to a more positive line

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:23.507
integral.

00:06:23.507 --> 00:06:25.090
Now let's think about
what's happening

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.530
in this situation
right over here.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.870
This situation down
here, our vector field

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.130
is going in the same
direction as our path,

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:35.260
so we're going to
get positive values.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.330
Just like the first situation,
as we go up the hill like this

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.435
or up the surface like
that, our vector field

00:06:40.435 --> 00:06:42.560
is perpendicular to our
surface, so it's really not

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.770
going to add anything
to our line integral.

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.909
And then as we go along this
top part, this first part

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:50.950
of the top part right over
here, the vector field

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:51.800
is going against us.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.620
So it's negative
right over here.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.360
We're going in the exact
opposite direction of our path.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.980
And then, right as
we get to the end,

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.720
the vector field
flips direction,

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.460
and we get a little
bit of positive right

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.168
over here because it's
a little bit of it

00:07:03.168 --> 00:07:05.100
going in the same direction.

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.920
And then we go back downhill.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.090
When we go back
downhill, it adds nothing

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.225
because our vector field
is going perpendicular

00:07:12.225 --> 00:07:13.420
to our path.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.930
So the big difference between
this case and the case

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:19.940
up here is the case
up here-- well,

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.740
actually, I could compare
between these two or these two.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.740
But the difference between
this one and this one

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.200
is that at least this
part of the vector field

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.500
has switched directions.

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.655
So we get a little
bit of positive value.

00:07:30.655 --> 00:07:32.280
And one way to think
about it, this one

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.738
is going to be less positive
than that, if we take the line

00:07:34.738 --> 00:07:36.662
integral, but more
positive than that.

00:07:36.662 --> 00:07:38.120
And one other way
to think about it

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.420
is, we have a little bit of
curl going on right over here.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.954
Our vector field switched
directions right around there,

00:07:44.954 --> 00:07:46.370
or I guess you
could say that it's

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:47.536
spinning right around there.

00:07:47.536 --> 00:07:49.580
So if you put a stick,
if that was in the water,

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:50.640
it would start spinning.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.840
But everywhere else,
there isn't a lot of curl.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.650
So you have some curl, but
it's over a little small region

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:56.640
of the surface.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.090
While over here, you
had curl going on

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:04.320
over a larger portion
of our surface.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.930
And so up here, you had
a more positive curl,

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:08.750
more positive line integral.

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:11.530
Here you have a curl
over less of the surface,

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:14.420
and you're going to have a
less positive line integral.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.550
Now let's think about
this one over here.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:19.680
This vector field, along the
surface there is some curl.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.270
There's some curl going
on right over there.

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:23.980
If you put a stick
in the water, if you

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:27.180
view that as the velocity of
water, the stick would spin.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.210
So you have some curl.

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:31.480
But then it switches
direction again,

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.690
so you have curl there as
well, and it's actually

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:35.232
curl in the opposite direction.

00:08:35.232 --> 00:08:37.440
So to some degree, if you
were to sum all of this up,

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.000
maybe it would cancel out.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.570
And it makes sense.

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:42.684
It makes sense that
it would cancel out

00:08:42.684 --> 00:08:44.310
because when you take
the line integral

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:47.340
around the whole thing, just
like this first situation,

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:49.235
it looks like it
will add up to 0.

00:08:49.235 --> 00:08:50.860
Because even though
you have some curl,

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:52.970
the curls cancel out each other.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:56.060
And so when you go to this
top part of the surface,

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.290
the vector field is going
in the exact same direction

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:00.830
as this bottom part
of the surface.

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:05.490
So if you were to take your line
integral, the same one that we

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:07.965
care about, just like
the first situation

00:09:07.965 --> 00:09:11.626
it would be positive down
here, 0 as we go up the curve.

00:09:11.626 --> 00:09:13.500
And then as we go down
here, the vector field

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.780
has switched directions
twice, so it's still

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.820
going against the
path of our contour,

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:20.470
just like this first situation.

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:22.310
So it would be
negative up there.

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:24.340
And then as we go
down, it would be 0.

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:28.250
So this thing right
over here also

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:31.340
looks just like the first one
because the curls essentially

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:32.220
cancel out.

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.880
We switched direction twice.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:40.450
So over here, our line
integral might also be 0.

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:43.040
Now, the whole reason why I
went through this exercise

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.830
is to give you an intuition
of why it might make sense

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:48.000
that if we have more
curl happening over

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.750
more of this surface,
why that might make

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:54.120
the value of this line
integral be larger.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.990
And so, hopefully,
it starts to give you

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:59.610
an intuition that maybe, just
maybe, the value of this line

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:10.150
integral, the value of F
dot dr over that contour,

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:12.706
over this contour that's
going in the counterclockwise

00:10:12.706 --> 00:10:14.580
direction-- we'll talk
more about orientation

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.910
in future videos-- maybe
this is equal to the sum

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:20.650
of the curls over the surface.

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:21.920
And so let's think about this.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.720
It could be a surface integral.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.950
So we're going to
go over the surface,

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:29.700
and what we care about
is the curl of F.

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:33.700
We care about the curl
of F. But we don't just

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.090
care about the curl of F
generally because F might

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:38.960
be spinning in a direction, in
a way, that's off the surface.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:42.120
We care about how much it's
curling on the surface.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:47.650
So what we would want to do is
we'd want to take the curl of F

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:50.920
and dot it with the
normal vector at any point

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:55.790
to the surface and then multiply
that times the surface itself.

00:10:59.955 --> 00:11:02.080
And this is just to say
that the more surface where

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.869
we have more curling
going on, the more

00:11:03.869 --> 00:11:06.160
that the line integral, the
value of the line integral,

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:06.659
might be.

00:11:06.659 --> 00:11:09.587
And we saw that when we
compared these three examples.

00:11:09.587 --> 00:11:11.170
And another way of
writing all of this

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:13.770
is the surface
integral-- let me write

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:16.160
the surface in that
same brown color--

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:21.220
the surface integral of the
curl of F, which would just

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:24.356
be another vector that tells
us how much we are spinning

00:11:24.356 --> 00:11:26.230
generally, but we want
to care how much we're

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:27.500
spinning along the surface.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.710
So we're dotting it
with the normal vector.

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:36.080
Or another way to write this
whole thing is to say dot ds.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:40.342
So if you take essentially the
sum across the entire surface

00:11:40.342 --> 00:11:42.050
of how much we're
curling, how much we're

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:45.740
spinning along that surface,
then maybe, just maybe,

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:48.500
this will be equal to the
value of the line integral

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.180
as we go around the
boundary of the surface.

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:54.100
And it actually turns out
that this is the case.

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.420
And obviously, I haven't
proven it to you here,

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:58.960
but hopefully you have some
intuition why this makes sense.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.370
And this idea that
this is equal to this

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:08.970
is called Stokes'
theorem, and we'll

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:12.130
explore it more in
the next few videos.
