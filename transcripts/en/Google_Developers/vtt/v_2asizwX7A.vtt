TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hi,
I'm Timothy Jordan,

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.120
and this is the Developer Show.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.117
We're here at Google I/O 2016.

00:00:07.117 --> 00:00:08.700
And over the next
several weeks, we're

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.400
going to be putting out some
episodes on specific topics

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.000
discussed here at
I/O. But for now, this

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.915
is what it felt like to be here.

00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:18.825
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.600
We're here at the ground
floor of Google I/O 2016.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.130
I'm here with Dion Almaer.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.130
Dion, how are you doing?

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.790
DION ALMAER: I'm
doing really well.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:40.300
Yourself?

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:40.925
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I'm
doing fantastic.

00:00:40.925 --> 00:00:41.810
DION ALMAER: It's go time.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.300
TIMOTHY JORDAN: We
are T minus two days.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.120
DION ALMAER: Yes.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.560
TIMOTHY JORDAN: We're going
to sneak around and take

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.010
a look at the I/O grounds
right before it gets done.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.468
So you get a
behind-the-scenes look

00:00:49.468 --> 00:00:51.389
at how I/O 2016 came together.

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:52.430
DION ALMAER: Let's do it.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.370
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:57.421 --> 00:00:59.670
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Oh, now this
is a completely different

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.450
micro environment.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.283
I think there's going
to be a lot of Android

00:01:02.283 --> 00:01:03.700
and some Firebase talks in here.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.491
DION ALMAER: Yeah, even
some improv comedy.

00:01:05.491 --> 00:01:07.120
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Is
that in here too?

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.770
OK.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:08.853
Let's go find some people.

00:01:08.853 --> 00:01:11.438
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.220
OK, so Chet Haase
is here to tell us

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.210
about the cool stuff
that's getting set up.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.680
Now is there
anything that you're

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.870
going to announce
that you don't want

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.120
to tell our audience right now?

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.830
CHET HAASE: Yeah.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.350
We're going to need to bleep out
the following phrase-- [BLEEP]

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.710
and this next one too.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.950
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Android.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.200
CHET HAASE: [BLEEP] not yet.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.060
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.500
What do you hope for this
I/O outside of your sessions?

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.400
CHET HAASE: Really good
developer engagement.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.350
Is that the phrase
you were looking for?

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.010
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yes, thank you.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.230
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:45.592
Tell me about the dinosaur.

00:01:45.592 --> 00:01:47.800
DION ALMAER: Yeah, so there's
this fun little feature

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.150
of Chrome where
if you're offline,

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.191
a little dinosaur comes
out, and there's actually

00:01:51.191 --> 00:01:52.550
a game that's in there.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.000
And you start hitting the
space bar and it jumps around.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.020
And this year, we want
to kill this dinosaur.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.484
We want to kill him.

00:02:00.484 --> 00:02:01.900
We always think
of the offline use

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.200
case of like, oh, what if
we make it so when Timothy's

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.760
on a plane, it still works?

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.760
But in reality, with cell
networks and the like,

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.409
it's going up and
down all the time.

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:11.200
So you don't want to
just be in that second

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.490
where you've got poor
network capability, all of it

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:14.720
stops responding.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.640
Now you can take
ownership of that.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.765
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Well let's
play a game of foosball.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.130
I think we're going to
explore this in some detail

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.890
again later too.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.465
But the cool thing
is it's got NFC.

00:02:27.465 --> 00:02:29.090
And you can just tap
your Android phone

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.910
and it keeps score for you.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.480
DION ALMAER: So what would the
score be right now if we'd--

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.430
TIMOTHY JORDAN: You'd
be winning decisively.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.650
DION ALMAER: I'm British,
so you know, table football

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.110
is in my blood.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.455
And thanks for hanging out, man.

00:02:41.455 --> 00:02:43.040
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hey, Dion,
thanks for hanging out

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.706
with me as well.

00:02:43.706 --> 00:02:46.220
It was really fun to explore
behind the scenes at Google I/O

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.804
2016 with you.

00:02:46.804 --> 00:02:48.969
DION ALMAER: I hope the
developers have a great time

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:49.810
this year.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.434
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I
think that they will.

00:02:51.434 --> 00:02:54.090
ANNOUNCER: Welcome
to Google I/O.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.170
SPEAKER 1: Today we are
announcing the Google

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.702
Assistant.

00:02:57.702 --> 00:02:58.660
SPEAKER 2: Google Home.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.390
SPEAKER 3: Allo.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:00.223
SPEAKER 4: Daydream.

00:03:00.223 --> 00:03:02.309
SPEAKER 5: Android Wear 2.0.

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:04.100
SPEAKER 6: The next
generation of Firebase.

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:10.100
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All
right, so Chu Ki,

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.150
you were in the audience during
the Google I/O 2016 keynote.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.490
I have a few questions for you.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.012
What are you most excited
about that was announced today?

00:03:17.012 --> 00:03:18.803
CHU KI CHAN: It was
kind of towards the end

00:03:18.803 --> 00:03:22.610
when they did the
Android instant apps.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.390
Meaning that, if you want to
send somebody something that

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.354
is better in an app
experience, but the person

00:03:29.354 --> 00:03:30.770
doesn't have the
app installed, he

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.960
doesn't have to suffer with
just using the web interface.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.800
He can want just the part
of the app that he needs,

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.220
and no need to install anything.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.360
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's really cool.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.380
CHU KI CHAN: That was amazing.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.840
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.320
CHU KI CHAN: Yeah.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.270
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And
what is it that you're

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.040
most excited to work on as soon
as you get back to your machine

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.127
at home?

00:03:45.127 --> 00:03:46.710
YOHAN TOTTING: I
think the first thing

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.980
that I want to-- I want to build
with a lot of new cool things I

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.059
saw, like in Firebase.

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:52.100
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Firebase.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.270
YOHAN TOTTING: Because
web developer and also

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.880
mobile developer, the
biggest challenge for us

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.055
is actually talking
to the backer.

00:03:59.055 --> 00:03:59.750
Right?

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.450
If you focus on
the web, you need

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.010
to learn also about how
you can build the API.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.090
But, using the
Firebase, I think you

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.890
can forget to think about that.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.220
You can just, using
the API, throw the data

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.090
into the Firebase,
and you can just

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.990
focus in your front
[INAUDIBLE] app.

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.510
So.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.830
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Absolutely.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.950
YOHAN TOTTING: Yeah,
it's a good thing for us.

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.560
TIMOTHY JORDAN: What are some
of the things at Google I/O

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.180
that you're the
most excited about?

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.790
LON HYLAN-CHO: Oh, definitely
the multi window support.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.534
And N. Like, that's
really exciting.

00:04:24.534 --> 00:04:26.700
I think, especially when
you're watching television,

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.020
because I write
television-related apps.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.665
Like, that's something that most
people do while multi-tasking.

00:04:31.665 --> 00:04:33.400
They don't just stare at
the television, right?

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.380
They're doing other things.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.870
So having the multi
window support

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.790
so that you could have
TV on one side of it,

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.530
and then like be
checking your email

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.110
or whatever else on the
other side without having

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.820
to leave the app.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.280
That's really cool.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.070
TAMARA WASHINGTON: Home.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.320
To the person who's left her
phone in her refrigerator

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.535
before, Home.

00:04:49.535 --> 00:04:50.785
TIMOTHY JORDAN: In the fridge?

00:04:50.785 --> 00:04:51.640
TAMARA WASHINGTON:
I actually have--

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.360
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's inventive.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.730
TAMARA WASHINGTON:
Well no, I've put it

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.320
down to get something
out and closed

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.610
the door didn't realize it.

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:57.740
And, you know.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.480
Cause you're always looking for
your phone for either a recipe

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.580
or what time am I
supposed to be here?

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.510
Or when am I supposed
to be doing this?

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.759
If I can just yell out to
something, that's fantastic.

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:08.401
Cause I'm always leaving my
phone somewhere in the house.

00:05:08.401 --> 00:05:09.920
TIMOTHY JORDAN: What are some of
the other things at the keynote

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.540
that you're excited
to play with soon?

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:12.700
TAMARA WASHINGTON: I'm
in material design.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.012
I went to some of the
sessions they had on it.

00:05:15.012 --> 00:05:16.220
It looked really interesting.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.120
Because coming from a
developer's background,

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.680
understanding what design
terms and what design

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.170
is needed, those type of things.

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:25.290
So yeah.

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.825
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:27.825 --> 00:05:29.200
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
We're here at the

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.620
After Hours at Google I/O 2016.

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:32.990
I'm here with Dion and Ben.

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.745
Hello, gentleman.

00:05:33.745 --> 00:05:34.560
DION ALMAER: How's it going?

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.893
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It's going well.

00:05:35.893 --> 00:05:36.800
How are you?

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.170
DION ALMAER: I went from
going from on stage giving

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.010
a talk to having
to just be up there

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:41.915
with this speechless
improv comedy night.

00:05:41.915 --> 00:05:43.290
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
And how was that?

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:44.410
DION ALMAER: It was fantastic.

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.250
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So one of my
favorite things about Google,

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.125
and I think you gentlemen
share this as well,

00:05:48.125 --> 00:05:51.080
is that work and fun are
not mutually exclusive.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.110
And that comes out
in I/O as well.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.895
So we spent all day learning
all these new technical concepts

00:05:55.895 --> 00:05:58.245
and API's, and at night, let's
have a little bit of fun.

00:05:58.245 --> 00:05:59.120
DION ALMAER: Exactly.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.000
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So
shall we do that?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.780
DION ALMAER: Let's do it.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:01.080
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.163
I think we should start
with the underwater disco.

00:06:03.163 --> 00:06:03.999
What do you think?

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:04.977
DION ALMAER: That
sounds like a good idea.

00:06:04.977 --> 00:06:05.955
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Right this way.

00:06:05.955 --> 00:06:07.080
DION ALMAER: Let's go then.
