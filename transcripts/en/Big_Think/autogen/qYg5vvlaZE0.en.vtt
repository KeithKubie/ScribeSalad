Houston there are different inputs and
 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.289
Houston there are different inputs and
different requirements then if you're

to deal with that and therefore come up
 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.810
to deal with that and therefore come up
with very different solutions for the
