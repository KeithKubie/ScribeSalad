00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.720
Hi, I'm Sarah Meister.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.800
I'm a curator here in the Department of Photography
at MoMA and we're thrilled to be bringing

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.150
you a live Q&amp;A on MoMA's YouTube channel.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.820
We are gonna begin here on the collection
storage while people get settled.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.640
This is where we store a huge percentage of
our collection.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.210
And we thought it'd be fun to pull some photographs
to show you a few before we get going with

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.159
the real Q&amp;A.

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:35.160
And while we do that, I'll not only try to
answer a few of the questions not formally,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.840
but a little informally, starting with, say,
show me a surprise,

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.720
something that's a little lesser known treasure
in the collection.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:49.180
So we also thought it would be a nice thing
to show you how we store the photographs,

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.400
why we store the photographs, and to share
a bit of our best practices.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.970
So most of the collections are in cabinets
like this.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.360
It keeps the water off.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.470
If the sprinklers go, that would be bad.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.900
It keeps them nice and cold.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.140
And we keep them in boxes, usually whenever
we can, unless they're too big.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:15.280
So here's a box that has some works that we
acquired a little more than a year ago.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.680
We try not to carry the boxes long distances,
so we don't risk dropping them, because that

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.090
would be terrible.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.340
And then when we open them, these are all
archival materials.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.439
We try to keep everything sort of neat and
calm.

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.639
We try when we're handling photographs to
like focus on the photograph and not focus

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:34.869
on, say, talking to you all.

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.750
So we don't damage anything.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.090
So this is a box of works by a Brazilian photographer
named Gertrudes Altschul.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.310
She's one of my current favorites, although
I can't say all time, because that's just

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.999
not fair.

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:52.340
And the one I thought I would show you is
here on the bottom.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.450
It's a photograph of a papaya leaf.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.770
It's pretty awesome.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.970
What I love about it is that it looks a little
bit like a photogram, almost like you could

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:04.970
see through it.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.799
Like she was squishing it flat onto the paper.

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.920
Except that when you see the stem, you realize
that this is actually like a three-dimensional

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.560
object in front of the camera.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.100
So I like this one a lot.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.860
This is a little bit of a surprise.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.360
It was on view last year if you came to New
York in a show that my colleague Starr and

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.920
I organized called

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.450
"Making Space: Women Artists and Post War
Abstraction."

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.560
But other than that, I'm sure no one had...well,
unless you lived in Sao Paolo, you had not

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.280
seen it before.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.060
So this is how we keep them.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.160
This is fortunately not too heavy, some of
them get really heavy, and then we have to

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.070
have a colleague come help us take them down
off the shelf.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.820
Okay.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.960
So this is not the official Q&amp;A, but we thought
we'd answer a few questions while we're in

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.870
here anyway.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:02.180
The first question, unofficially, is from
Victoria on Instagram and Danny on YouTube,

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.940
who both asked, basically,

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.530
"What is the temperature in there and why?

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.180
Or why is the collection storage space so
cold?"

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.510
So it's about 50 degrees in here, 40% relative
humidity.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.640
And yesterday when I was getting ready for
this, I asked our conservator.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.360
I was like, "How do I describe why it's so
cold?"

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.240
And her answer was...I was thinking she was
gonna give me some complicated chemical or

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.220
something.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.440
She's like, "Everything goes more slowly when
it's cold."

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.210
And so if you think of the photographs having
active particles in them, the more you slow

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.970
it down, the longer they live.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.650
So this is true for color photographs, especially,
but also for gelatin silver prints, like most

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.350
of what we'll be looking at today.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.120
So it's cold to keep everything lasting as
long as possible.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.010
And that's also why we use archival materials.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.430
I just washed my hands.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.069
So if you see me handling a lot of things,
I wouldn't do that unless I had just washed

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:00.570
my hands.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.490
So that's question number one.

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.290
We have another question that says...and this
is from Chris on Instagram.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.400
And he writes, "What is your collection policy?

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.760
And Alfred Stieglitz, please."

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.910
So excellent choice, Alfred.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.690
No, Alfred Stieglitz.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.070
Excellent choice, Chris.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.410
I pulled a few extra, a little bit like a
cooking show because sometimes if you have

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.290
to take them down, we have to go too far and
it takes too long.

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.530
So I pulled three other photographs, including
the Stieglitz just to show while we're here

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.280
in collection storage getting warmed up.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:41.290
The first one of these, I mean, I'll say,
everything I'm showing, I love all these photographs,

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.100
but this one is pretty great.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:48.180
Now you'll see there's a little bit of a reflective
surface on this, and I'll lift it off to make

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.610
it easier to see.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.180
This is called Mylar.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.550
It protects the surface of the picture in
storage and we actually attach it with tape

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.260
at the top, but it's a special low tack tape.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.810
So this is a photograph by Berenice Abbott
and it's called "New York at Night."

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:09.130
She made it in 1932 right after the Empire
State Building opened.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:14.480
And she made it on one of the shortest days
of the year, so in sort of mid to late December.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.950
And she did that because she wanted the city
to be dark,

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.160
but she wanted everyone to still be in their
offices so that all the thousands and thousands

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.960
of office lights are on.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.330
So it's almost like you couldn't make this
picture in the summer because it would be

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.380
light too late.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.870
And by the time was dark, everybody would
be gone home for the day.

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.940
I hope.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.250
So this is a terrific one and I can't remember
who but somebody definitely wanted to see

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.380
Berenice Abbott.

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.690
So that's one.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:46.300
And then, you know, again, like I was saying,
you just wanna handle them carefully,

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:52.240
slowly because, of course, the worst thing
you could ever do to a photograph is damage it.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.480
That would just be the worst.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:00.850
The next photograph I wanted to show you,
again, thanks to Chris asking for Alfred Stieglitz,

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:05.120
"this terrific image of Stieglitz's made?"

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:14.480
I'm just gonna do this because Stieglitz really...although
Berenice Abbott was a little more forgiving

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.520
about the presentation, Stieglitz was very
precise.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:25.800
So here's a photograph he made of his wife
Georgia O'Keeffe and her car.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.300
And what I love about this one.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.580
This is at his house in Lake George.

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:35.600
And to me, he's very well known for the group
of portraits that he made of Georgia O'Keeffe.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:42.460
But to me, this is sort of a symbol of her
independence, how by 1935 she was definitely

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.350
a mature artist in her own right, had much
more of a sense of autonomy.

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:50.690
And I think there's something almost sort
of wistful about this thinking of her hopping

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:53.740
in the car, and maybe going back to New York
City.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:07:01.200
And so even though the photograph is so beautiful,
and you'd see the sky reflected on the paint finish

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.480
it still makes me think there must have been
something about this car that made him feel

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.740
a little wistful or makes me feel wistful,
please.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:17.580
So, again, the other thing I try not to do
is to actually, and this is super easy to

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:18.590
do at home,

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:22.650
don't talk over your photos, because everybody
spits when they talk.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:27.180
And especially if you're standing right over
it, you should be careful.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:31.550
Because spit is not a good friend to photographs
as you might imagine.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:32.850
All right.

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:40.070
And then the last one I pulled for us to look
at today is this huge, beautiful print.

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:43.650
Well, kind of gritty, maybe beautiful is the
wrong word.

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:47.170
I'm gonna leave the Mylar on it because it's
too complicated to take this one off.

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:53.120
This is by a photographer named Gordon Parks,
and it's from a photo story that he did for

00:07:53.120 --> 00:08:00.580
"Life Magazine" called "The Atmosphere of
Crime" in 1957.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:04.090
It's actually, I learned more recently, a
color photograph.

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:08.120
But it was super difficult to print in color
back in the 1950s.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.630
It was very expensive.

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:14.820
So even though in the magazine, a lot of his
photographs are reproduced in color, the print

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:19.680
we own that we acquired from Gordon Parks
is actually in black and white.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:24.979
And so it's something I think is really interesting
to think about, like, what makes photographers

00:08:24.979 --> 00:08:26.260
make the choices they do?

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.850
And sometimes it can be an incredibly practical
thing.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:33.490
Like, it's way too expensive to make a color
photograph in the '50s.

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:38.570
So instead, you kind of heighten the graphic
quality and you make it in black and white.

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:46.950
So I also thought it would be fun while we're
here to look for one last picture, to look

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:48.580
at a recent acquisition.

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:52.100
And these are...if we'd been here a week ago,

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:56.149
I wouldn't be able to show this to you because
it would have been a secret because our committee

00:08:56.149 --> 00:08:58.899
on photography wouldn't have approved it yet,

00:08:58.899 --> 00:09:02.470
but now it's all approved so I can show you.

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:09.020
So we saw a few things framed and these are
the framed ones, but sometimes something so

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:14.060
big, it's here only temporarily like for an
acquisitions meeting.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.240
Super careful.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:25.080
Now, for those of you at home, this is not
part of the photograph, this is just a string

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.550
to make sure it doesn't fall off.

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:29.540
That would be terrible.

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:35.390
But this is an incredible photograph by Deana
Lawson that was in her exhibition, not that

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:37.520
long ago at Sikkema Jenkins.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:46.980
It's really an incredibly powerful and, you
know, even bordering on scary photograph.

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:55.060
And I love also that a new aspect of her work
is she has included the sort of image that's

00:09:55.060 --> 00:10:00.170
affixed to the outside of the Plexiglas, so
this is a new aspect of her work.

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:07.180
She was actually honored last night as one
of the honorees at the Gordon Parks Foundation

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:07.960
Gala.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.760
So that was nice to see her and celebrate
her there.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.670
And I thought to myself, "And we just acquired
it."

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:16.830
So let's get out of here.

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:17.540
It's cold.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.620
I'm sure there are enough people.

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.520
We'll go do a real Q&amp;A in the study center.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:22.860
Thanks for joining me.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:53.360
All right.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:57.880
Here we are in Collection...no, now we're
out of Collection Storage.

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:03.830
My hands are cold, my face is cold, but we
are going to have fun out here.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:07.060
I have a whole pile of questions to answer.

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:12.459
We got so many great ones from the trailer,
both on Instagram and on YouTube.

00:11:12.459 --> 00:11:13.630
We picked some of my favorites.

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:17.590
And I'll apologize in advance that we won't
get to do everyone's, but we'll really do

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:19.270
our best.

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:23.460
If you have any other questions, we're also
gonna try to work in some questions that are

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:24.930
submitted live.

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:29.839
So there's a little live chat section.

00:11:29.839 --> 00:11:33.459
And I have some colleagues here who are gonna
write down your questions and give them to

00:11:33.459 --> 00:11:37.690
me, and then we'll try to answer those as
well.

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:39.640
All right, let's get to the questions.

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:44.339
Okay.

00:11:44.339 --> 00:11:53.180
The first one is from Anastasia from YouTube
and she writes, "What aspect of the work should

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:56.980
we focus on first, when we visit a photography
exhibition?"

00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:00.300
And I think that's such an excellent question.

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:01.640
It's like, what do you think about?

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:04.459
You walk in, let's say, you don't know the
work, what are you gonna look at?

00:12:04.459 --> 00:12:07.709
How are you going to think about it?

00:12:07.709 --> 00:12:12.279
I like to see an exhibition...at first, I
like to just look at the work.

00:12:12.279 --> 00:12:16.870
So you try to do sort of a sweep through and
you think to yourself, "Let's look at what

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:18.150
this artist is doing.

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:21.790
What are they doing in terms of scale, what
are they doing in terms of subject matter?

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:26.360
Do there seem to be important things about
the materiality of what they're doing?"

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:29.290
And you kind of just get a general feel.

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:34.710
If I'm at a gallery or at a museum, then I
usually go up and I try to read the wall text.

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:40.230
I would recommend not doing that first because
it kind of opens up a little bit more what

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:45.200
your experience can be, if you've had a little
time with the art first.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:51.779
And then after that, chances are, I'll go
back again and maybe the second time around,

00:12:51.779 --> 00:12:55.620
you pick fewer pictures, but you just dive
in a little deeper.

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:59.840
When I go with my children, I call it a surgical
strike.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:05.560
So with them, I might skip the first and the
second parts and just say, "Okay, we're gonna

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.360
look closely at three pictures.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.360
And that's it."

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:12.260
And, you know, that can be a really rewarding
thing, too, is just sort of slowing down enough

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.050
to look at just a couple of things.

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:17.560
But that's an excellent question.

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.210
Thank you.

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:21.470
Carrying on.

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:30.760
Okay, Mac J. on Instagram wrote, "Are there
specific steps one can take to become a curator

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.850
of photography?"

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:35.600
Another good question.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:43.020
I would say, yes, there are typical ones and
then there are less typical ones.

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:49.620
The typical one might be an art history major
in college.

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:54.459
And then you might try to get some practical
work experience.

00:13:54.459 --> 00:14:01.829
So let's say you go work in a gallery, or
an auction house or a museum and you try to

00:14:01.829 --> 00:14:05.580
sort of get some experience working with real
works of art.

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:10.860
And then most photography curators go to graduate
school.

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:15.740
I happen to be an exception to that, but it's,
particularly this day and age, much, much

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:16.800
more common.

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:24.329
So I would say it's a combination of school,
work experience.

00:14:24.329 --> 00:14:28.370
And then the nice thing is, and the way I
feel here at MoMA is like, your learning goes

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:29.370
on and on.

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:35.890
So although I'm not specifically in school
anymore, I always try to go see as much art

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:36.890
as I can.

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:38.180
I try to read a lot.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:44.399
I try to have conversations with my colleagues
to try to understand the way they see things.

00:14:44.399 --> 00:14:49.329
And traveling is also a really wonderful way
if you're able to,

00:14:49.329 --> 00:14:52.910
to try to understand how people see things
and do things differently in other parts of

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:53.910
the world,

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:58.260
which can be hard, but that's optimal if you
can do that.

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:00.900
We're okay?

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:03.600
All right.

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:10.920
So A. Wiedler wrote on Instagram, "I love
Helen Levitt's work and saw some online at

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.400
MoMA's website."

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.200
So guess what, we pulled one.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:17.480
I love Helen Levitt too.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:24.620
The first one we pulled is this, one of Helen
Levitt's most famous images.

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:30.420
And this photograph was actually...came into
the collection in...

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:35.540
well, officially accessioned in 1941, but
it was a photograph of Helen Levitt that she

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:38.800
made in 1940 on the streets of New York.

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.740
So you have to imagine that's a super short
time.

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:50.209
It's actually not...unlike the Deana Lawson,
where it's a recent work and we're just acquiring

00:15:50.209 --> 00:15:51.209
it,

00:15:51.209 --> 00:15:55.890
that happens less frequently, I would say,
than sometimes a little more time passing.

00:15:55.890 --> 00:16:00.520
But so Helen Levitt made this photograph in
1940, in December of 1940.

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:07.000
We actually exhibited it here at MoMA in the
first exhibit of the formal department of

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000
photography.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.620
Oh, I forgot to mention that.

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:15.260
So we have a Department of Photography and
we have had a Department of Photography ever

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.510
since December 1940.

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:24.220
The museum started in 1929, so the museum
was just 11 years old when we established

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:26.290
a department of photography.

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:32.820
And it was a great moment and the show that
they organized was called "Sixty Photographs:

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:35.670
A Survey of Camera Esthetics."

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:40.060
So it was setting forward that photography
was an art form with its own set of aesthetic

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:41.620
concerns.

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:47.760
And this actual print, not just this image,
but this actual print was included in that

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:48.760
exhibit.

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:52.870
And one of the things I love is that now on
MoMA's website,

00:16:52.870 --> 00:17:00.020
you can actually go on to the exhibition history
and see images of this picture on the walls

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.940
at MoMA, which is really cool.

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:04.870
So sorry, to turn to the question,

00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:11.189
"What qualifies an artwork to be on the website
as opposed to an exhibition at the museum,

00:17:11.189 --> 00:17:14.059
who, and, most importantly,

00:17:14.059 --> 00:17:15.910
what makes that decision or difference?"

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:20.390
So there's a super practical question really
about the website, which is that for us to

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:21.500
put something on the website,

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:27.890
it has to have an image and we generally try
to have permission from the artist or to have

00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:29.169
it be copyright free.

00:17:29.169 --> 00:17:31.740
So that's how it gets on the website.

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:39.250
To be in an exhibition requires more deliberation
usually...no, actually almost exclusively

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:40.580
on the part of the curators.

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:44.270
So the curator say, "I really wanna put this
work on view.

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:47.070
I'm gonna put it on in view in this context."

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:51.070
So this one, for instance, when they said,
I want to pick "Sixty Photographs" that represent

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:55.360
camera aesthetics for MoMA's public in 1940.

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.540
So that's how that happens.

00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:59.850
I'm gonna answer a live question now.

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:00.850
This one just came in.

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:02.780
Okay.

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:05.320
This is from Alexander on YouTube.

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:10.600
"Does MoMA archive a digital copy of all those
photographs?"

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.140
Super great question.

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:15.460
And the answer is, yes, really.

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:19.650
Whenever we get a new acquisition, and we
also work backwards to make sure we have an

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:22.309
image of everything that's old,

00:18:22.309 --> 00:18:29.350
we make a digital copy with our...we have
a great photo studio and they make an image.

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:33.220
It's the sort of digital version of what we
used to have in doing an analog way, which

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:37.060
was we had a copy negative of every work in
the collection.

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:42.350
And we use those digital copies to make reproductions
in books and to share if somebody requests

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:43.870
them from us.

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:48.600
So, yes, we really, really try.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:52.250
Sometimes if it's a work that's super big
and super complicated to install,

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:57.870
until we install it for the first time, we
might ask for an image from a gallery or from

00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:58.870
an artist,

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:02.950
but we really prefer and try to make them
all our own.

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:07.360
One more from YouTube before I go back to
some of the ones that came earlier.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:10.880
"Does MoMA..." and this is from Daphne, also
through YouTube.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.670
Oh, I guess they're all through YouTube now.

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:13.670
Okay.

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:14.670
If it's a new one, it's from YouTube.

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:17.300
"Does MoMA collect Polaroids?"

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:20.900
And the answer is, absolutely yes.

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:26.590
Our conservator calls them internal dye diffusion
transfer prints because we try to not use

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:27.590
brand names.

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:30.490
We try to refer to the actual chemical process.

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:36.419
But really, it's a Polaroid and actually we've…our
compromises that we call it an internal dye

00:19:36.419 --> 00:19:38.559
diffusion transfer print (Polaroid).

00:19:38.559 --> 00:19:41.280
So, yes, we do.

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:45.860
The reason we didn't pull any of those is
that we keep those in a super cold part of

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:50.530
the storage that to take them out of there
you have to let them acclimatize overnight,

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:53.840
and we really try to do that only when we
really need to.

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:56.310
We have plenty of other stuff to show you
today.

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:58.660
All right.

00:19:58.660 --> 00:19:59.660
Another one on YouTube.

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:01.470
This one's from Nicholas.

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:03.410
"Is forgery ever an issue…"

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:04.710
Wow, great question.

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:09.890
"Is forgery ever an issue in photography,
the same way it is in painting?

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:10.890
Why?"

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:13.270
Yes, it is.

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:21.380
There have been some really fascinating forgery
stories in the history of photography.

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:29.760
And well, I would say, I don't wanna…oh,
shame it...you know, the thing is photography

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:35.490
is a reproducible medium so that carries with
it a whole host of complications.

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:44.280
And this is not to say that people can't detect
forgeries, and they can, but actually,

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:49.800
the thing that has helped photography for
most of its history is that photographs were

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.530
never really worth that much.

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:56.539
So if it wasn't worth that much, who would
bother to make a forgery?

00:20:56.539 --> 00:20:58.860
A little bit later, we're gonna talk about
Dorothea Lange.

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:02.940
And when we do, we'll get to the idea of an
original and a copy, which is not the same

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:05.720
thing as a forgery.

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:08.750
But certainly, forgery can be an issue.

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:10.710
I don't want to out anyone though on YouTube.

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:12.380
That doesn't seem nice.

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:13.510
Okay.

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:17.570
One more from the live ones and then we'll
go back to some of the earlier questions.

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:19.120
This is from Katherine Ellington.

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:25.820
Oh, and I'm hoping I'm allowed to say this.

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:30.840
Katherine is a mentor in our course, online
Coursera, seeing through photographs, which

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:35.220
means that she helps sort of lead group discussions
and things like that.

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:36.669
So thanks, Katherine.

00:21:36.669 --> 00:21:42.470
So, Katherine asks, "How do you decide on
frames for photographs?"

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:49.870
That is a really good question and it's something
that I actually...it takes a while to learn

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:53.470
how to pick the right frame for a photograph.

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:58.830
The way I learned how to do it was to spend
a lot of time looking, of course, and listening

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:01.640
to Peter Perez in our frame shop.

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:06.020
He is the foreman of our frame shop and he
is just brilliant.

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:11.260
So he helps me think through, will this picture
look better in a dark frame or with a light

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:14.760
frame, with a walnut frame, or a metal frame?

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:20.970
And you want a frame that sort of helps you
focus on the work.

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:25.289
But you may have noticed when we were in storage,
we looked at that Deana Lawson picture, she

00:22:25.289 --> 00:22:28.020
picked a frame that has this gilded front.

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:30.230
So sometimes artists pick their own frames.

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:36.450
And in that case, we respect that and we really
just try to take care of those frames carefully.

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:41.060
But certainly, how we decide to frame things,
you may not even notice when you come to the

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:42.060
museum.

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:46.130
In fact, we hope you don't notice the frames
when you come to the museum.

00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:51.750
We want you to look at the photographs, but
we do try to make selections about those frames

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:53.289
that help you focus on those.

00:22:53.289 --> 00:22:57.539
If we had all different frames in all different
ways, it might be confusing and might not

00:22:57.539 --> 00:23:00.260
help the art look as good as it can look.

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:01.260
Okay.

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:03.540
Back to some other questions.

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:08.340
Oh, this was a tough one, but I decided I
wanted to answer it anyway.

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:13.309
This is from Bill Gubbins on YouTube, and
he wrote, "In the '80s, MoMA photo curator,

00:23:13.309 --> 00:23:18.850
John Szarkowski called Garry Winogrand, 'The
central photographer of his generation.

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:24.410
'Who do you believe is the central photographer
of the current generation?"

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:27.820
And people ask me this a lot.

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:39.260
And I'm not being lazy when I say, I think
the world today has reached a point where

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:44.770
it doesn't really make sense to think of a
central photographer of a generation.

00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:50.890
They're too many really great artists working
in too many different paths to conceive of

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:54.150
themselves as essentially as a generation
of artists.

00:23:54.150 --> 00:24:02.110
And so every time we organized a photography
show that features a lot of the photographers

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:06.539
who we think are important and doing new work.

00:24:06.539 --> 00:24:10.610
And certainly, if you look at the artists
where we do a one-person show, we have a Stephen

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:14.780
Shore retrospective on right now on view on
the third floor.

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:21.039
These are certainly central figures of their
generations.

00:24:21.039 --> 00:24:22.670
But we really...I don't know.

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:26.591
I don't like to answer that question in the
singular, so, sorry to answer your question

00:24:26.591 --> 00:24:28.721
with not an answer, but there you have it.

00:24:28.721 --> 00:24:31.950
Oh, here's a good one.

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:38.060
So this is from Instagram, and Jane Mordini
writes, "Doesn't WPA..." and by that I think

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:43.220
she is referring to the Works Progress Administration
and/or the government.

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:47.060
"Doesn't WPA own Dorothea Lange photos?

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:48.840
How can you make copies?"

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.539
So this is super interesting.

00:24:50.539 --> 00:24:59.360
I'm gonna put away our Helen Levitt and I'm
gonna take out some Dorothea Lange photographs.

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:05.230
So the first one is Lange's iconic "Migrant
Mother.”

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:10.380
And yes, Lange made this photograph while
working for the U.S.

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:11.440
Government.

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:19.080
She was actually working for the Resettlement
Administration in 1935, which became the Farm

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:22.289
Security Administration in 1937.

00:25:22.289 --> 00:25:30.920
But if you just think of it as the alphabet
soup of government planning under FDR, she

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:31.920
was one of those.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.690
And the WPA was also one.

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:38.670
So yes, Dorothea Lange made this photograph
while working for the government,

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:45.510
which means that it has always been throughout
its life available for anyone to use with

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:48.410
no copyright restrictions whatsoever.

00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:53.780
And in fact, if you go on to the Library of
Congress's website today, you can download

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:57.830
a file made from this negative and print your
own.

00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:59.960
And there's nothing wrong with that.

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.350
It's not illegal.

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:02.880
It's not a forgery.

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.409
It's just what it is.

00:26:04.409 --> 00:26:09.799
Now, I happen to be writing a book about Dorothea
Lange's "Migrant Mother," so stay tuned, it'll

00:26:09.799 --> 00:26:12.800
come out this fall.

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.420
And there was another question.

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:20.830
Yeah, this is from Lou on Instagram, who writes,
"What is the airbrush technique?

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:24.510
And how can you recognize it on a picture?"

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:31.880
So, Lou, we thought it would be interesting
to pull together not only a classic very early

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:34.210
print of Lange's "Migrant Mother."

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:39.840
This is one that came into the collection,
probably in 1949, so it's not one of the earliest

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:42.030
prints, but it's an early print.

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:46.600
And I thought it might be interesting to look
at this one next to this.

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:52.730
So this is a print of Lange's "Migrant Mother"
that came to us from the "New York Times."

00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:56.710
It has heavy, heavy airbrushing on it.

00:26:56.710 --> 00:27:02.600
So if you look, for instance, you see...and
the way you can tell airbrush is, unlike up

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:07.410
here where you can see that the paint has
been like wash, like painted on.

00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:09.110
You can kind of see the brushstrokes in it.

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:12.710
When you have airbrushing, it's a super even
look.

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:16.500
And when you look at it under a microscope,
you can actually see the little, little dots

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:21.390
from the way that the paint has spat on to
the surface of the picture.

00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:26.070
But it makes for a much more dramatic contrast.

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:30.429
So when you paint in the dark parts, like
the spaces between their fingers,

00:27:30.429 --> 00:27:34.630
and then you airbrush other parts to make
it look smoother, you can see how,

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:41.800
if you were reproducing this in a newspaper,
let's say, how this photograph would reproduce

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.880
much more cleanly than this.

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:50.160
And, since I sort of promised we would do
this, we...and remember I said I washed my

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:55.090
hands, so if our conservator is watching,
I promise I did.

00:27:55.090 --> 00:28:00.170
The other thing that's great about this photograph,
if we take it out, is that on the back...now,

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:03.580
of course, I'm being so special with this.

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:08.270
You understand that before this photograph
came to MoMA, thousands of people probably

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:11.309
held it with the dirtiest hands you can imagine.

00:28:11.309 --> 00:28:12.740
It was circulated.

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:18.130
Every one of these stamps on the back suggested
or tells a time when it was reproduced in

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:19.150
the "New York Times."

00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:26.470
So the earliest one that I found is here,
July 26th, 1936, and that is the earliest.

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:29.659
But it actually was reproduced up through
1976.

00:28:29.659 --> 00:28:31.230
That's the most recent stamp.

00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:35.270
So this is a photograph that even though now
that it's here at MoMA, we treat it super

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:38.260
precious and we're taking very good care of
it.

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:45.270
It lived a long very active life in the "New
York Times" photo morgue before it came here,

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:50.480
and it's a really good example of a lot of
retouching and airbrushing on a photograph.

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:55.090
So put that back carefully.

00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:58.820
We also have a preparator in our department
who helps us make these things like these

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:03.940
little very a special origami-like photo corners.

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:08.740
And that's because one of the principles of
how we store the collection is that we try

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:12.320
to make everything as reversible as possible.

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:18.679
So we try whenever we do anything to a photograph
to allow it to be undone.

00:29:18.679 --> 00:29:20.850
We try not to hinge it whenever we can.

00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:24.010
We use photo corners instead.

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:27.200
And so those are decisions that you can make
with your own photographs.

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:31.710
Like if you put a lot of tape on the back
of your picture, if you ever have to remove

00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:33.659
that tape, you are gonna have problems.

00:29:33.659 --> 00:29:36.500
So keep that in mind.

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:40.770
All right, I'm gonna keep going.

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:47.080
Oh, this is a super complicated question,
but I really liked it.

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:51.190
This is from Ken on YouTube, Ken Spencer.

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:57.679
And he wrote, "I have never understood the
reasoning or logic behind the photographer,

00:29:57.679 --> 00:29:58.799
Sherrie Levine,

00:29:58.799 --> 00:30:04.360
who has made outright copies of the work of
Walker Evans and then displays the prints

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:07.450
as her own with a credit line like this,

00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:10.460
'Sherry Levine: After Walker Evans.'

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:15.890
As a professional photographer all my life,
this seems like an outright copyright violation.

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:17.740
What am I not understanding here?"

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:21.090
So, Ken, you are really getting to the heart
of it.

00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:23.029
So let's dig in.

00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:25.440
We talked a little bit about forgeries.

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:27.360
Hold on.

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:29.980
This one is safe.

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:33.710
We talked a little bit about forgeries, and
we talked about how you can make a Dorothea

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:39.720
Lange picture yourself, which is not a forgery,
just by downloading the file.

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:47.350
But I thought what we'll do is actually show
you a Sherrie Levine.

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:53.020
And MoMA doesn't own the series that you were
talking about "Sherrie Levine: After Walker

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:56.980
Evans," but we do own this "After Rodchenko."

00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:01.149
So the "After Walker Evans" pictures were
from like 1981.

00:31:01.149 --> 00:31:06.270
These were from a few years later, maybe 1987
I think.

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:10.260
But it's really interesting when you get the
opportunity to see them both up close and

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:11.260
together.

00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:15.890
So I wonder if I can fit these both.

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:17.520
I'm gonna hold on to this one.

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:23.120
Okay, so this is a Sherrie Levine and this
is an Alexander Rodchenko.

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:31.650
Now if you look at the Rodchenko up close,
I'm gonna open the mat, it's a super delicate

00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:33.299
picture.

00:31:33.299 --> 00:31:36.530
This is a photograph of his mother.

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:40.350
And you see the little inscription below.

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:45.280
It's attached asymmetrically to this beautiful
old mat.

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:51.340
It's a beautiful, it's sort of a tender poignant
picture of his mother struggling to read holding

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:53.980
the glasses up to her eye.

00:31:53.980 --> 00:32:00.260
And then you look at it next to the "Sherrie
Levine: After Rodchenko."

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:03.610
Well, there are a couple things you'll notice
immediately.

00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:05.670
One is that it's reversed.

00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:12.320
So Sherrie Levine is making her photographs
from reproductions of those photographs.

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:18.549
And she is not trying to make you think...well,
she isn't trying to make you think that it's

00:32:18.549 --> 00:32:19.620
a Rodchenko.

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:23.710
She wants you to be able to recognize the
image, but she's really poking at the question

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:27.440
of, like, what's an original and what's a
copy,

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:31.789
have originals historically favored reputations
of male artists,

00:32:31.789 --> 00:32:36.140
where the idea of multiplicity of lack of
originality

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:41.120
might be something new that she and artists
of her generation in the '80s were exploring.

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:47.399
And so she's not trying to imitate the tonality,
and she often includes little cues that help

00:32:47.399 --> 00:32:52.159
you understand that what she's making isn't
the same as the original.

00:32:52.159 --> 00:32:53.929
It's her version of it.

00:32:53.929 --> 00:32:59.929
So it is a really complex question.

00:32:59.929 --> 00:33:07.919
There was an artist, not that long ago who
actually made copies of Sherrie Levine's photographs.

00:33:07.919 --> 00:33:11.110
I think, if you google it, you'll find it.

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:15.710
Adding another layer to this idea of what's
considered appropriation.

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:22.409
And it is perfectly permissible to appropriate
work in pursuit of making another work of

00:33:22.409 --> 00:33:23.409
art.

00:33:23.409 --> 00:33:32.120
And so this fall pretty squarely into that
category, which is why they're okay.

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:43.330
So, close it up.

00:33:43.330 --> 00:33:44.330
Okay.

00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:45.330
So, excuse me.

00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:46.330
I'm sure I'm going to butcher this name.

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:47.360
I'm sure I've butchered other ones earlier,
apologies.

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:54.539
But on YouTube Chirag Wakaskar wrote, "Is
there an effort by MoMA curators to have a

00:33:54.539 --> 00:33:58.150
more diverse group of photographers archive?"

00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:01.580
By which I understand you mean in the collection.

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:04.150
And yes, absolutely.

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:09.230
We pursue this through a lot of different.

00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:13.950
And this is not just unique to my photography
colleagues, these are my colleagues from all

00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:15.259
different departments.

00:34:15.259 --> 00:34:25.339
So we definitely want to have the collection
represent the diversity of artistic production.

00:34:25.339 --> 00:34:31.119
And that means having photographers of different
genders, of different races, from different

00:34:31.119 --> 00:34:33.289
places, from different times.

00:34:33.289 --> 00:34:41.339
Because the idea is that, well, how much more
of an interesting reflection of not only our

00:34:41.339 --> 00:34:47.450
time, but of historical times, if we can understand
a more diverse area of practice.

00:34:47.450 --> 00:34:51.259
So I'm actually going to Cuba tomorrow.

00:34:51.259 --> 00:34:56.489
We have these wonderful research groups at
the museum that are called C-MAP, Contemporary

00:34:56.489 --> 00:34:58.839
and Modern Art Perspectives.

00:34:58.839 --> 00:35:06.049
And what those C-MAP groups do is to try to
help MoMA curators develop a deep familiarity

00:35:06.049 --> 00:35:07.469
with artistic practices

00:35:07.469 --> 00:35:12.829
that might be less well known in the U.S.
and in Western Europe,

00:35:12.829 --> 00:35:17.670
and to try and say, "How can we really better
understand what's happening in Latin America,

00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:21.719
in Asia, in Central and Eastern Europe, in
Africa?"

00:35:21.719 --> 00:35:26.140
And these are, you know, partly why I feel
so lucky to be a MoMA curator,

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:32.180
is that parts of our job is to try to develop
that expertise and we're given incredible

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:34.299
tools to do that.

00:35:34.299 --> 00:35:39.660
So yes, diversity is an important thing for
MoMA curators and it's also an important thing

00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:42.400
all the way up to the director and our trustees.

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:47.119
They're the ones who really make all of that
research and study possible.

00:35:47.119 --> 00:35:49.829
Good question.

00:35:49.829 --> 00:35:52.559
Oh, okay.

00:35:52.559 --> 00:35:55.109
So Matt Spaul wrote on YouTube.

00:35:55.109 --> 00:35:59.670
"I've read that Man Ray made photograms without
a camera.

00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:00.779
How was this done?

00:36:00.779 --> 00:36:04.109
Does MoMA have any examples in the collection?"

00:36:04.109 --> 00:36:05.789
Oh, do we?

00:36:05.789 --> 00:36:10.700
So I'll put away this Rodchenko.

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:22.359
We are so lucky that in 1941, a collector
named James Thrall Soby gave to the museum

00:36:22.359 --> 00:36:25.109
a group of photographs by Man Ray.

00:36:25.109 --> 00:36:28.970
Now, by the way, I was talking about how we
store them before.

00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:32.779
This is a good example of when we're really,
really, really being careful.

00:36:32.779 --> 00:36:39.150
So this one has not only Mylar, that's that,
but it also has a sheet of what we call photo

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:45.469
text, because these are super fragile and
a photogram means that it's unique.

00:36:45.469 --> 00:36:50.519
So take down the Mylar, remove the photo text.

00:36:50.519 --> 00:36:52.660
I'll leave this open like this.

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:57.759
So yes, when Man...and I'm gonna actually
talk behind it, because God forbid, I should

00:36:57.759 --> 00:36:59.589
spit on that photograph.

00:36:59.589 --> 00:37:02.229
So, Man Ray, when he made these photograms.

00:37:02.229 --> 00:37:08.859
This is a unique contact print, which means
that he took little glass stoppers from maybe

00:37:08.859 --> 00:37:12.859
crystal bottles and a little bit of gauze

00:37:12.859 --> 00:37:19.420
and a little piece of wire that he put in
a cube and two other things that I can't quite

00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:20.680
figure out what they are,

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:26.319
but he placed all of those things directly
onto a piece of photographic paper and then

00:37:26.319 --> 00:37:29.469
he turned on the light, and then turned off
the light.

00:37:29.469 --> 00:37:35.349
And in that exposure, anywhere where the light
could get through to the paper, it became

00:37:35.349 --> 00:37:36.349
dark.

00:37:36.349 --> 00:37:38.959
And anywhere the light was blocked, it remained
white.

00:37:38.959 --> 00:37:41.130
So this is something that's opaque.

00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:44.190
This is sort of semitransparent, like the
glass.

00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:47.279
And then the black was where the light shone
straight through.

00:37:47.279 --> 00:37:53.760
So, yes, the photograms actually are unique,
and they are not made with a camera, which

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:56.970
is partly why they're so precious and we wanna
take care of them.

00:37:56.970 --> 00:38:01.910
And thanks to James Thrall Soby, when these
group of pictures came to the collection in

00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:03.020
1941,

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:07.950
these were the pictures that were used as
the plate, most of them, for the plates in

00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:10.940
a book that Man Ray published right around
that time.

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:14.440
Well, actually, the book was from '32...actually
'34.

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:17.630
But anyway, it doesn't matter.

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:26.289
They are really special things and we feel
very lucky to have them in the collection.

00:38:26.289 --> 00:38:30.250
Thank you, James Thrall Soby.

00:38:30.250 --> 00:38:35.480
Moving on.

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:38.099
Okay.

00:38:38.099 --> 00:38:42.829
So this is from Instagram, somebody whose
name couldn't be this, but we'll answer it

00:38:42.829 --> 00:38:45.670
anyway, from Optoomistic writes,

00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:51.799
"Please discuss in detail your preservation
best practices and procedures."

00:38:51.799 --> 00:38:55.119
So we've been talking about that a little
bit all day basis.

00:38:55.119 --> 00:39:00.730
Basically, the preservation is like, you wanna
be sure to have your hands clean,

00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:05.039
you wanna be sure to try to have archival
materials around the photographs whenever

00:39:05.039 --> 00:39:06.039
possible,

00:39:06.039 --> 00:39:13.009
you wanna keep them as cold as possible, and
to not have your humidity fluctuate greatly.

00:39:13.009 --> 00:39:17.380
So that's what our collection storage does.

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:20.170
You know, it's an ongoing effort.

00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:25.670
If you're trying to do this at home, certainly
not having your photographs in direct sunlight

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:29.150
is a really good place to start.

00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:34.130
And then every other little step that you
can do to preserve your photographs,

00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:37.789
you know, we all want them to live a long
time, whether it's a family photograph or

00:39:37.789 --> 00:39:39.299
something in MoMA's collection.

00:39:39.299 --> 00:39:42.609
So I hope that's detailed enough.

00:39:42.609 --> 00:39:43.999
It's probably not.

00:39:43.999 --> 00:39:47.630
But actually, we could do a whole other session,

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:52.769
maybe I should suggest this on photography
conservation because we have lots of great

00:39:52.769 --> 00:39:55.759
colleagues in conservation who can help us
do that.

00:39:55.759 --> 00:39:59.839
Okay, well, this is a little similar.

00:39:59.839 --> 00:40:05.450
This is from Mury Hamilton, Mury, also on
Instagram.

00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:08.369
Oh, I'm gonna answer Mury's because it's actually
related.

00:40:08.369 --> 00:40:13.019
And then I see there's a whole pile of other
ones that a magic little birdie, namely our

00:40:13.019 --> 00:40:15.039
producer brought to me.

00:40:15.039 --> 00:40:18.480
But Mury wrote, "What are some restoration
challenges with the photographs you have in

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:19.480
your collection?

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:22.430
And/or what are the common restoration practices?"

00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:28.170
So some of the challenges have to do with
physical damage to the print like cracking

00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:31.339
and things like that, edge damage.

00:40:31.339 --> 00:40:38.430
And to help address those, we definitely try
to store them carefully.

00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:44.519
Our conservators can actually rework things,
reinforce things pretty magically.

00:40:44.519 --> 00:40:49.709
You know, but the one thing that we really
can't do is when like a color photograph fades.

00:40:49.709 --> 00:40:51.519
That's pretty much it.

00:40:51.519 --> 00:40:56.359
So that's why we try to store everything so
cold in Collection Storage.

00:40:56.359 --> 00:41:04.979
So we're working on trying to share what we
call our conservation practices, our storage

00:41:04.979 --> 00:41:06.779
practices more broadly,

00:41:06.779 --> 00:41:10.779
because the truth is, we don't wanna just
hoard that information for ourselves.

00:41:10.779 --> 00:41:12.109
We want everyone to know it.

00:41:12.109 --> 00:41:17.619
So now I'm triply convinced that we should
do a conservation session.

00:41:17.619 --> 00:41:25.140
This is a live question from Kathy and Lim
on YouTube.

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:34.019
And she wrote, "What is the percentage of
film versus digital prints collected by MoMA?"

00:41:34.019 --> 00:41:37.549
It's a terrific question and it's ever more
important today.

00:41:37.549 --> 00:41:44.170
So I would say the thing you have to keep
in mind is that digital prints didn't exist

00:41:44.170 --> 00:41:46.670
until, say, the last 20 years.

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:52.410
So before then every photograph we have before
the mid-'90s is not a digital print.

00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:57.059
So by the numbers, the percentage of digital
prints is quite small.

00:41:57.059 --> 00:42:01.690
But if you look more recently, if we're just
taking into account, let's say, the last 20

00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:02.859
years,

00:42:02.859 --> 00:42:06.589
one of the interesting things that I found,
especially in the last decade,

00:42:06.589 --> 00:42:11.829
is that you can't always tell, and that is
because the technology has caught up to the

00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:19.269
point where whether you have a print from
a film negative

00:42:19.269 --> 00:42:25.380
or a print from a film negative that has been
scanned to become a digital file or from a

00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:29.430
file that was actually born digital, captured
digitally.

00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:33.420
All three of those things...well, the first
one, you can't make a digital print from that,

00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:38.619
but it might be virtually indistinguishable
from the second and the third, which is the

00:42:38.619 --> 00:42:39.619
great part.

00:42:39.619 --> 00:42:45.910
So I guess partly, what I would say is, in
more recent years, maybe if you can't tell,

00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:47.279
it doesn't matter as much.

00:42:47.279 --> 00:42:51.959
We're more concerned with what inks are you
using?

00:42:51.959 --> 00:42:53.209
How should we store it?

00:42:53.209 --> 00:42:54.999
How should we preserve it?

00:42:54.999 --> 00:43:00.529
So, still, film wins out over digital, but
just mainly because of the history,

00:43:00.529 --> 00:43:06.319
more and more and more current photographers
are making prints, either from scanned film

00:43:06.319 --> 00:43:10.039
negatives or from digital files.

00:43:10.039 --> 00:43:11.969
Interesting now.

00:43:11.969 --> 00:43:14.229
The world is changing.

00:43:14.229 --> 00:43:20.789
So, sadly, this one means that we're reaching
the end of our time.

00:43:20.789 --> 00:43:24.390
I really enjoyed your questions.

00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:29.739
I wish I could answer them all day, but everybody
here has to go home.

00:43:29.739 --> 00:43:33.200
I just wanna tell you where some of the people
have been tuning in from.

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:41.410
We have people from Spain, Iran, Honduras,
Colombia, Argentina, Germany, Hong Kong,

00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:42.769
you must be so tired,

00:43:42.769 --> 00:43:51.289
Bulgaria, Brazil, Serbia, San Francisco, Reno,
Nevada, Columbus, Ohio, Chapel Hill, North

00:43:51.289 --> 00:43:53.259
Carolina, Oklahoma, Moscow,

00:43:53.259 --> 00:43:54.680
also must be tired,

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:57.190
Croatia and the Ukraine.

00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:58.480
That's so terrific.

00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:03.499
I love seeing how many people tuned in from
all over the world.

00:44:03.499 --> 00:44:06.499
So we hope you enjoyed this.

00:44:06.499 --> 00:44:07.499
If you did...sorry.

00:44:07.499 --> 00:44:12.240
There are a few things I'm supposed to remember
to say as we wrap this up.

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:17.069
There are other live Q&amp;A sessions on MoMA's
YouTube channel, check them all out.

00:44:17.069 --> 00:44:18.160
They're all really terrific.

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:20.519
I learned a lot through them.

00:44:20.519 --> 00:44:23.619
You can also look through, we have a special
photography playlist,

00:44:23.619 --> 00:44:29.750
which includes a lot of the videos that we
made for an online course called "Seeing Through

00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:31.349
Photographs" on Coursera.

00:44:31.349 --> 00:44:36.229
And to those of you who are our Coursera learners,
thank you for taking the course.

00:44:36.229 --> 00:44:41.400
Your enthusiasm means so much to us and we'll
keep doing these activations.

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:49.059
There'll be a link to the scenes for photographs
in the comments saying if you wanna do that.

00:44:49.059 --> 00:44:53.829
And if we didn't get to your question, I know
I have a stack here, I know there were others

00:44:53.829 --> 00:44:54.829
that came in.

00:44:54.829 --> 00:44:56.630
First, I'm sorry.

00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:57.630
We're doing our best.

00:44:57.630 --> 00:45:02.099
I was trying to rip through them, but we'll
also try to continue answering them in the

00:45:02.099 --> 00:45:03.099
coming days.

00:45:03.099 --> 00:45:05.380
So thanks for tuning in.

00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:07.289
Keep sending us questions.

00:45:07.289 --> 00:45:10.839
Let us know if you wanna see more of these
live Q&amp;A's and what you'd like them to be

00:45:10.839 --> 00:45:11.999
about.

00:45:11.999 --> 00:45:16.400
And also, most importantly, subscribe to MoMA's
YouTube channel so you don't miss another

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:17.400
one.

00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:17.900
Thanks a lot.
