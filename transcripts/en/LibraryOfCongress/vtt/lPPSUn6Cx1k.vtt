Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.600
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: I'm
Steph Marcus from the Science,

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.810
Technology and Business
division,

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.150
and I want to welcome you

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.760
to the second lecture
of our 2018 series.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.580
Our next one will be May
15, and that's going to be

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.260
on water security,
using satellites

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.240
to monitor water
around the Earth.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.940
Mars, it's always
popular, and it seems

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.160
like just recently we had a talk
on Maven, another Mars mission

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.820
that was called Case of the
Missing Martian Atmosphere,

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.810
but that was in 2014, and our
speaker is, was, on that team,

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.110
and he's also going to be

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.420
on the upcoming Mars 2020
team if we get the money.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.100
So, right now he's going
to, he's all involved

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.520
with the Rover Curiosity,
and today we're going to hear

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.660
about the five years
of information

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.150
that we've got from Curiosity.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.780
Our speaker is Dr.
Scott Guzewich.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.080
&gt;&gt; Dr. Scott Guzewich:
Thank you.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.380
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: I bet
none of you guessed how

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.780
to say his name, but I'm
glad I learned it's Guzewich,

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.090
and he is, he was a web
officer in the Air Force,

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.990
so a little bit different
background

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.570
from some of our speakers.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.840
He got his degree in meteorology
from Penn State and an MBA

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.440
from Cameron University, and
then finally his PhD in Earth

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.740
and Planetary Sciences
from Johns Hopkins.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.660
So, let's get started
and hear about Curiosity.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:47.960
Thank you.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.260
&gt;&gt; Dr. Scott Guzewich:
All right, thanks Steph.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.560
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus:
You're welcome.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.860
&gt;&gt; Dr. Scott Guzewich: All
right, so hello everyone.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.690
I'd like to talk to you
about the last five years

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.800
that we've explored
Mars with Curiosity.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.430
I'm a member the Mars
Science Lab science team.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.380
I've been a team member
since just after landing,

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.580
and today we'll talk about
swimming in Martian lakes.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.420
So, what I want to start with a
little bit here is we're going

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.650
to go in the way back machine,
and we're going to kind of talk

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.520
about our history of Mars
over the last century

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.710
and why we are exploring
Mars today with Curiosity

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.410
and how much we progressed
over the last hundred years.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.230
I mean literally in
my grandparents' time,

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.960
this was the vision
of Mars that we had.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.670
And it's pretty remarkable
when you think that just

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.530
within a generation or two we've
gone from having a spacecraft

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.260
on Mars, multiple
spacecrafts on Mars

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.110
at the same time exploring
Mars, to having people

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.860
like Percival Lowell
peak through telescopes

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.310
and then hand draw pictures

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.510
of what they think they
saw on the surface.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.400
And the sort of work by people

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.910
like Percival Lowell really
captured the imagination

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.830
because he imagined sort
of with a mistranslation

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.110
from an earlier Italian
astronomer, Schiaparelli,

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.170
that there were these
canals on Mars,

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.300
that the Martians were living
on a dying world, bringing water

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.600
from their receding polar caps
down to their drying farms

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.390
at low latitudes, and that this
was sort of the vision of Mars

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.930
that then captured the
public imagination.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.230
Field science, fiction,

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.810
things like Orson Wells'
famous radio broadcast,

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.560
and this was the vision of Mars
that most of the public had.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.110
And so, you know, we kind

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.860
of imagined not only
was Earth populated,

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.200
but of course Mars
must be populated.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.500
Venus perhaps too.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.630
This was the place that
we thought we came from.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.510
And really only a couple
decades after this, you know,

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.260
not long after Percival Lowell
died we went from this vision

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.600
of Mars to having a space
program where we could think

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.700
about actually sending a
space craft, as primitive

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.400
as it may have been, to Mars to
see what Mars was like truly,

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.510
truly there, and the planet.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.310
And so early here in the
Space Age in the early '60's,

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.440
it was actually the Soviet
Union that was trying to do most

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.740
of the Mars exploration

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.120
and unfortunately failing
miserably for the most part.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.000
They sent, actually
the Soviet Union

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.510
and Russia has never had
a successful Mars mission.

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.140
But they sent a number
of Mars missions here,

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.240
and they either all blew
up on the launch pad,

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.140
a couple actually made it
into space and then failed

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.490
at some point during
their transit to Mars.

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.960
Of course in the U.S. we also
had some failures as well.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.580
And note though here that a
lot of these in the early days

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.160
of the space program
were launched in pairs.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.580
They built things redundantly.

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.420
They had two of the same
space craft because they knew,

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.980
a lot of their rockets blew up,

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.800
a lot of their space
crafts failed.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.940
And so, you know, the Soviet
Union would launch things

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.240
in pairs.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.980
We would launch things
in pairs as well.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.120
So Mariner 3 here was a launch
failure, but thankfully,

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.470
the next one website not.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.390
And that was Mariner 4.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.670
So Mariner 4 was the
first space craft

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.390
to actually make it
all the way to Mars.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.690
This was the fly-by mission.

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.350
So we had sort of a philosophy
in planetary exploration

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.510
where we fly, fly by, we orbit,
we land, and then we rove.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.960
So fly-by means take the space
craft shooting past the planet

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.160
and hopefully taking as many
pictures or pieces of data

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.010
as we can as we go by.

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.870
And early days here in the
early '60's, this was 1965,

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.800
Mariner 4 flew by and took
20 pictures, 20 pictures.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.580
We take hundreds with
Curiosity every single day.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.130
Twenty pictures was
the whole breadth

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.210
of our exploration
from Mariner 9.

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.130
And, you know, take a
look at this image here.

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.430
This is one of the images.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.960
Now we knew what the
moon looked like, right.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.120
We've been looking at the
moon now with space craft

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.540
and telescopes at
this point in 1965.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.160
We knew the moon was a dead
place, but we still had

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.640
that hope that maybe Mars
was at least something

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:23.940
like what Lowell thought it was.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.900
Maybe there was, okay, maybe
there were not civilizations,

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.830
but there was always maybe
plants or there's microbes

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.970
or there's something
there that's not the moon.

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.350
And so Mariner 4
flew by and saw this,

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.800
and I've asked elementary
school kids, you know,

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.860
what do you think this picture
is, and they say the moon,

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.170
and it was like well exactly,

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:41.470
and that's what everybody
thought.

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.080
It was like, oh, we actually
found Mars was just a big giant

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.570
red version of the moon.

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.660
And so without waiting
for anymore data,

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.340
the New York Times confidently
declared Mars is dead.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.640
That's it folks.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:53.940
It's over.

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.240
Mars is dead, we don't
need to bother anymore.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.460
President Johnson was so
glad that he was not going

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.940
to be invaded by Martins
because he was terrified

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.300
from the 1938 Orson
Wells broadcast.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.600
So he was like, okay, good.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.900
We're not going to be
invaded by Martians.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.530
We only have to worry
about those Soviets.

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:11.870
But then Carl Sagan here
pointed out, now 20 pictures

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.410
at 1 kilometer resolution,

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:17.210
so most of your good
weather satellite data is 1

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.510
kilometer resolution.

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.820
So can you see any people
or even cities really

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.530
at 1 kilometer resolution?

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.130
Not so much, you know.

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.330
You can see plants, because we
know what the color change is

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.850
from fall to spring
and that sort of thing,

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.820
but you don't see any animals,
and so Carl Sagan quipped here,

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.080
if there were kilometer-long
elephants covering the surface

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.880
of Mars, we wouldn't
have seen them.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.600
But actually this sort

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.630
of disappointing result actually
did result in a reduction

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.340
of funding for March
exploration in the late '60's,

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.420
but not enough hopefully,
thankfully, to kill the program

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.390
because we actually
sent Mariner 9.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.790
And what Mariner 9
did was actually went

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:54.090
into orbit around Mars.

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:56.180
And so this was key because
instead of just flying by

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.950
and shooting a bunch of
pictures as fast as possible

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:00.180
and then shooting off into
space never to be heard from,

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.510
Mariner 9 went into orbit.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:03.940
And it went into orbit at
a very particular time,

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.650
where it was lucky
it went into orbit,

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:07.430
because if it had just flown by,

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.680
all we would have seen
was this giant dust storm,

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.290
which is what actually I study.

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:14.430
But there was this huge
global dust storm on Mars

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:17.580
when Mariner 9 arrived in 1969.

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:20.220
And these dust storms
occur periodically on Mars

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.810
where the whole planet is
shrouded in this dense haze

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.320
of dust, and you cannot
see the surface at all.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.990
And so imagine if it had
just been shooting by.

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:28.530
We would have just seen
these murky photographs

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.950
with no surface features
whatsoever.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.270
But luckily it went into
orbit and so it could wait

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.020
until the dust began to settle
and the dust dissipated,

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.120
and as the dust was beginning
to dissipate, we saw these,

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.860
four actually, one's
off the screen here,

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:45.190
but these four giant little
spots on the surface here,

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:48.320
and what these are, these are
volcanos, and these volcanos are

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.660
so large that they
actually essentially stick

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.550
out of the atmosphere
into space.

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:54.990
The one volcano that's off
screen here is three times the

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:56.560
height of Mount Everest.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.730
And this mountain essentially
sticks above, sorry,

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:01.580
sticks above the surface
of the planet so far

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.430
that the atmosphere is
essentially all below the top

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:04.730
of the mountain.

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:06.930
And so the volcano sticked
above this layer of dust,

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:08.280
and so we could see these.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.390
And then as the dust began
to settle, we finally began

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:12.030
to see Mars as a real place.

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:14.030
And we saw amazing
features like this here.

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:17.130
This is an ancient river
valley called Nirigal Vallis

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:20.490
that looks anything like a river
valley here on Earth, the Nile,

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:22.090
the Amazon, the Mississippi,
whatever the case.

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:25.390
All these branching tributaries
and things like that,

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:28.740
and we finally realized,
Mars is not the Moon.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.270
It's not Earth, but
it's not the Moon.

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.530
It's a distinct place
all to itself.

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:35.140
And soon after, in the
mid-'70's we send Viking,

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:38.440
and Viking not only orbited
but landed two space craft.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.470
This is surface frost
here on a cold morning,

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:42.160
just like we have
here in DC or Maryland

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.460
on a cold winter morning.

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:45.360
We get frost on the
ground that then evaporates

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.560
or sublimes during
the afternoon.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.910
Same thing here on Mars
where Viking landed.

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:52.420
And we finally saw Mars is
a real place unto itself.

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.600
It's a unique planet
with unique properties

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.060
and maybe an amazing history

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.440
that we don't quite
understand yet.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:02.160
So Viking went primarily
to find life.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.940
So we knew by Mariner
9 here, okay,

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.320
we're not finding
any civilizations.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:08.060
We're not finding any giant
forests or anything like that,

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.750
but there's still maybe
good reason to think

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.050
that there's microbes
in the surface.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:12.530
We know there's water
in the polar caps.

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:14.200
There's water in the atmosphere.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.980
You know, maybe there's liquid
water sort of percolating

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:17.500
in the soil, and maybe
there's still microbes.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.400
So that's where Viking
was sent to explore.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:25.030
And Viking landed and had
very specific measurements

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:26.950
that they were taking
to test for life.

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:28.490
And the most famous of these

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:30.300
or perhaps the most infamous
was called the Labeled

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:31.740
Release Experiment.

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:34.390
So what this did is it
scooped up some soil.

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:35.690
It put it in a little chamber,

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:37.750
and of course microbes
need to eat, right.

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:42.790
So they fed the microbes with
a very specific type of food

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:47.800
and water that was marked with
a certain radioactive isotope.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.790
So presumably, the microbes
would eat this radioactive food,

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:53.850
and then they would respire and
kind of breathe this back off

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:56.810
in there, and then that
respiration would be tested for.

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:58.110
And they did several of these.

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:00.460
And so here's a control
experiment, right.

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:01.760
Nothing happening.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.710
You know, didn't feed anything
to the soil, nothing happens.

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:06.310
You feed something
to the soil and boom,

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:08.570
you get this huge
response, which would suggest

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:11.990
that there are tons of living
microbes in the Martian soil.

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:13.750
And, of course, this was
understandably exciting.

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:16.050
You know, this is a, this is
exactly the sort of result

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:17.700
that people would have expected.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.760
But thankfully we didn't
just sent the Labeled

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.290
Release experiment.

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:25.350
There were other tests that we
did to the soil to see, okay,

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:27.170
there should be other
things, other properties

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:29.800
that living things
would have in the soil.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:33.380
And so one of those was
called a mass spectrometer,

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:36.130
and that's designed to basically
test what the soil's made of.

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:38.690
And so every living thing on
Earth has organic molecules,

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:41.140
carbon-bearing molecules
in it, right.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:44.130
And so you should have tons
of carbon-bearing molecules.

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:45.430
If the life is like Earth,

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:47.110
you should have all this
carbon-bearing material

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:48.410
in the Martian soil.

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:52.180
And not one organic molecule
was detected, not one.

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:55.130
And so there was this
puzzling contradiction here.

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:57.620
You have this seemingly
very positive experiment,

00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.880
but then you have every other
sign, not just this one,

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.240
but every other test saying
that there's no life at all,

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.650
and not even like a hint of it.

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:05.150
There is nothing there.

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:06.580
So you have a very
positive and then

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.510
like three very negative
results.

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:10.790
And this was very puzzling
for obvious reasons,

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:14.150
and actually the, Gill Liven,
the PI here still insists

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:16.200
that the Labeled Release
Experiment found life.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.770
Still insists because he
believes there are some other

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:20.460
problems with the
other experiments.

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:23.030
But his opinion is
certainly in the minority.

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:24.330
And we have a pretty
good understanding

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:27.720
of why these experiments
gave the results they did now

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.470
with more knowledge.

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:32.770
But you can imagine here, so
we went there looking for life,

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:35.310
and the general consensus
was we didn't find it.

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:37.510
You know, Mars truly is dead.

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:39.160
And that was pretty
disappointing because, you know,

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.470
Mars was sort of the last
hope in the solar system

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:43.800
at that time, or so we thought.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:48.150
And so we kind of went to this
long pause, essentially 20 years

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:50.050
where we didn't send
a mission to Mars,

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:51.740
and there's obviously
some other reasons why

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.600
that probably happened, but
certainly scientifically was

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.750
because Viking was sort of
disappointing in that way as far

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:59.170
as searching for life.

00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:00.980
There were certainly
lots of exciting things

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:02.880
about maybe Mars a long
time ago, but nothing today.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.960
And so the only space craft
launched over a 20-year period,

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:12.780
from 1975 to 1996, was
Mars Observer in 1993.

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:16.320
This was a very capable
mission, and it got literally

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:21.990
within 3 days of Mars and then,
uh oh, it did not turn out well.

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:24.460
And the general consensus
is there was a fuel line

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:27.540
that somehow got ruptured
and basically shot it off

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:28.840
in an opposite direction.

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.320
It lost radio contact
with Earth and never

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.820
to be heard from again.

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:33.120
Now this was a pretty
big mission,

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.420
so that was disappointing,
obviously.

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:37.580
This was the first Mars
mission in a long time,

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:39.420
and during a period where
NASA was not sending a lot

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:40.720
of planetary missions.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.770
I mean nowadays we're sending
usually one or two per year,

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:48.020
knock on wood, and we're not
doing that as much 20 years ago.

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.130
So that was pretty
disappointing,

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:54.570
but soon afterwards, we had
a very exciting moment occur,

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:57.830
and this was a very
formative moment in my life,

00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:00.180
and if any of you were kind
of alive and paying attention

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:02.620
to the news in 1996,
particularly in the summer

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:05.130
of 1996, you would
have remembered this,

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:07.500
because this was on
all the news channels.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.180
And I was at the beach at
this time on a vacation

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:11.750
with my family, and I was
glued to the TV screen.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:15.380
I could not pull myself
away from this news,

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:19.530
which was that this rock,
a Martian meteorite,

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:21.530
had evidence of life in it.

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:24.650
And so this rock,
it's called ALH84001.

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:28.160
So this designation is how they
assign names to meteorites,

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.690
and it's basically because
this was found in Allen Hills,

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:34.580
Antarctica, in 1984, and it was
the first one of the season.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:38.190
So every summer in Antarctica,
winter here, we send a team

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:41.440
of scientists down to Antarctica
to collect meteorites.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:44.480
And so why are meteorites really
easy to find in Antarctica?

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.370
Because this is brown,
and Antarctica is white.

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:49.190
All right.

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:50.560
So they stick out.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.840
I guarantee you, there
are meteorites here in DC,

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:56.040
not far away, but I couldn't
find them for you, you know.

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.810
They don't look any different
to me than any Earth rock,

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:02.240
but on Antarctica, the only
thing there is meteorites.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.230
And the way the glaciers
flows actually,

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:06.800
so these meteorites sometimes
can actually get incorporated

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:09.980
into the ice, get buried
by long distant, you know,

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.280
hundreds of feet
down into the ice.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:13.580
And then as the glaciers flows

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:14.880
up against these
mountain ranges,

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.490
they sort of get kind
of pulled back up.

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:19.060
And there are fields
essentially full

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:21.390
of meteorites just sitting
there where these glaciers sort

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:23.250
of kind of let them
deposit as the ice sort

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:26.260
of evaporates way
against these hills.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:27.560
And so there are
certain places here.

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.120
One of my colleagues just got
back from this a few months ago.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:33.740
Teams go down to these certain
places and collect meteorites,

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:35.920
and the reason, when
this was first found,

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:38.100
it was actually thought
to be a lunar meteorite.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.590
And the reason we know
this came from Mars is

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:42.080
because we sent Viking there,

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:45.770
and we know what Viking
found Mars to be made of.

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:48.120
And we said, hey, okay, this
is what Mars is made of.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.420
This is Mars.

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:51.080
And we've only found a few
of these Martian meteorites.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.610
There's literally
like a couple dozen,

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:55.860
and some are actually kind of
probably from the same rock.

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:59.660
What unique about ALH84001
is it's very, very old.

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:01.770
It's like three and a half
or more billion years old,

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:04.770
and we can do that by various
tests to see what the ages are,

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:07.700
the various materials in there,
that this is a very ancient rock

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:10.420
that was formed at a time when
probably Mars looked a lot more

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:14.060
like Earth, and so that
alone made it very exciting.

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:15.860
But then they started
digging into it more,

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:19.080
and they found certain
chemistry that on Earth is,

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.380
at the time we thought,

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:21.870
seemingly only produced
by biology.

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:23.170
And don't ask me
what those things are

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:24.620
because I'm not a biologist,
but there were certain things

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:26.900
in there that are only
produced by living things.

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:29.840
And then of course what got
all the press was this picture.

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.200
This is an electron
microscope picture

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.470
of what looks all the world
like some sort of worm fossil,

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:37.440
the difference of course
being that this is tinier

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.740
than any microbe on Earth.

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:41.510
This is nanometers
long, extremely tiny,

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:43.360
but it sure looks like
a worm to me, right.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.830
So this is the fossil that
we found in the Martian rock.

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:49.320
And of course this was
basically all over the news.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.510
President Clinton made a
statement there at the time,

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:54.970
and this was really
what drove me to want

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:56.840
to study Mars because,
you know, this just kind

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.140
of captured my imagination.

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:00.250
Instead of being out there on
the beach enjoying my vacation,

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:04.840
I was watching TV in the room,
all about a Martian meteorite.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:08.910
And so this really kickstarted
a new era of Mars exploration,

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:12.780
because really about
the same time in 1996,

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:15.460
we launched the little
plucky Sojourner rover here,

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:20.500
which landed on July 4,
1997, and just for a sense

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.750
of scale here, Sojourner is

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:26.730
about the size of
a small microwave.

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:28.950
So, and then the Spirit
and Opportunity rovers,

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:31.830
this is Spirit as
seen from orbit.

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:34.660
Spirit and Opportunity sort of,
you know, go up to about here,

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:37.830
and you know, maybe cover
sort of this whole area

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:40.070
over on speaker's lectern,

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:43.140
and then Curiosity is
essentially a mini Cooper.

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:45.270
So that's you sense of
scale where, you know,

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:47.110
kind of moving up there.

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:48.760
And what really changed then

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:51.630
in 1996 was we had a
Mars exploration program.

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:53.100
We didn't have these
one-off missions.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.830
You know, Viking
was two missions,

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:56.130
but it was sort of a one-off.

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:57.910
And then we went 20 years,
and then we had Mars Observer,

00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:00.630
which was a one-off, and it
failed, so nothing happened.

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:02.370
And then we said, hey, you know,

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:04.980
we're going to have a
whole program that's going

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:07.430
to follow the water, that
was the catch phrase,

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:08.890
and we're going to learn
about the history of Mars,

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:10.760
and we're going to understand
where the water went,

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:13.420
did Mars have life long ago.

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:14.720
And this started all kind

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.800
of with the little
Sojourner rover there,

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.120
and then we sent orbiters,
the orbiter looking

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:21.360
down here on Spirit from above.

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:23.620
So at the same time, we
finally had things active

00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:25.290
on the surface and
active in orbit.

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:26.910
And that's really key
because you get the sense

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:28.970
of perspective that's
totally unique

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:30.590
that you can't get
from either place.

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:31.890
Of course, if you're
on the ground,

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:33.190
you're in one little
spot, right.

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:35.460
I mean how much could
DC tell you about Earth?

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:37.090
I mean honestly, if you
took away all the buildings

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:38.630
and everything, I'm
not a geologist that,

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:40.810
well I don't know much, but
how much could DC tell you

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:42.110
about Earth?

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:43.410
You know, could it
tell you about deserts?

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:44.710
No. Could it tell
you about oceans?

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:46.370
No. Could it tell you
about the polar caps?

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:48.930
No. You know, one
little place on Mars,

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:50.500
how much can it tell
you about the planet?

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:54.000
But then you get that in situ
knowledge that then you can use

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.860
from orbit to kind of
extrapolate to the planet,

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:57.730
and you get a much
broader perspective,

00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:01.200
and that's what having a
program really offered us.

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:05.010
So that kind of went
for a few years,

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:07.110
and now we got to about 2003.

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:09.010
And so this is what
we knew by that point.

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:11.060
We knew Mars once had
flowing liquid water.

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:14.440
This is an image here of
an ancient river delta,

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:17.490
and it looks all the world like
what you would see if you looked

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:19.190
at a satellite image of
the Mississippi flowing

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:20.490
out into the Gulf of Mexico.

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:21.850
You see these sort of
branching patterns.

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:24.940
In southern Louisiana you
get these branching canals

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:28.080
and networks of things
as it flows out and sort

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.010
of new channels form
constantly, and it moves around.

00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:32.460
And that's exactly what
you get here on Mars,

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:33.760
but of course it's all dried up.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.060
There's nothing there now.

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:36.830
But long ago, there was
something there, and we can tell

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:38.600
by just the shape of this delta,

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:42.980
the way these different channels
kind of cut over each other

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:44.830
and are deposited on
top of each other.

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:46.810
We know that this actually
lasted for a long time.

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:49.650
This was not just a
one-off giant flood

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:50.950
that then evaporated immediately

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:52.250
and was gone within
a few months.

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:53.550
This took time.

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:55.430
This took a lot of
time, you know, decades,

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:57.360
millennia, maybe even more.

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.780
We knew Mars once
had a magnetic field.

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:03.060
A magnetic field on Earth
protects us from the solar wind.

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:05.190
So the solar wind is
constantly trying to kind

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:06.790
of strip away our atmosphere.

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:08.450
And because the Earth is
bigger, that helps too,

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:10.870
but we have an active magnetic
field that kind of pushes all

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:12.770
of that charged particles
away from Earth.

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:15.970
And if any of you were here for
the Maven talk a few years ago,

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:17.410
that's what happened
to Mars basically.

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:18.890
The magnetic field went away,

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:21.420
and the whole atmosphere
was basically stripped off

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:23.130
into space, just pulled
away over billions

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:24.430
and billions of years.

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:25.730
And it's still happening today.

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:27.030
Mars is still losing
atmosphere today.

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:29.560
And so we knew Mars once had
a much thicker atmosphere.

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:31.260
We didn't know how thick, but
we knew it was thick enough

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.690
to allow liquid water
to flow on the surface.

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:35.920
And you need to have some
amount of sort of heft

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:37.900
to the atmosphere to
allow that to happen.

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:39.560
It can't happen today.

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:45.670
And so this was 2003, and so
what kind of became was the idea

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:48.150
for the Curiosity rover, which
would have been a step up.

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:49.450
At the time, it was going

00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:51.500
to be a more incremental step
then what it ended up turning

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.110
out to be, but an
incremental step

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:54.700
above Spirit and Opportunity.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:57.700
Because what we wanted to answer
was how long did the liquid

00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:59.000
water last?

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.200
Was this really like a flash in
the pan, you know, decade-type,

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.050
decades, you know,
intermittent-type thing,

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:06.020
or was this a long-term thing

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:08.710
where life would have had
time to evolve perhaps.

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:10.380
How long did that
thicker atmosphere last?

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.330
These kind of go hand in hand.

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:14.430
And even if liquid
water was there and even

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:16.890
if the atmosphere was there, was
the environment truly habitable?

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:20.310
You know, was this some sort
of like acidic, boiling mess

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:22.570
that only like the
most extreme lifeforms

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:23.870
on Earth can survive in.

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:25.360
Or was this something much
more temperate, you know,

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:28.560
kind of what we hope, which
was much more temperate clement

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.920
environment where all
manner of life could live,

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.960
at least as we understand
it here on Earth.

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.370
And then was the
chemistry right?

00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:36.810
Did we have the different
ingredients that life needs?

00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:38.560
Life needs a whole host

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.080
of different chemical
compounds to live.

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.380
It's not just carbon.

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:42.680
It's not just water.

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:43.980
There's phosphorous.

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:45.280
There's nitrogen.

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:46.960
There's any number of
different things that life needs

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:50.410
to have the different pathways
form chemically, to have sources

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:54.420
of energy to live on, and
so was the chemistry right?

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.840
And so we said, okay, so this is
what the next mission is going

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.140
to address.

00:20:58.140 --> 00:20:59.440
This is what Curiosity
will address.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.740
It wasn't called
Curiosity at the time.

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.860
It was called the Mars Science
laboratory, which it still is.

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:05.440
But that was what this
mission would accomplish.

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:08.930
And so as we packed on all these
instruments or what we wanted

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:10.230
to put them, and we said,
wow, this thing's going

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:11.600
to be pretty darn big.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.640
And unfortunately when
it's pretty darn big,

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:16.670
we can't land it the same way
that we landed things before.

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:19.150
So before with Spirit,
Opportunity, and Sojourner,

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:20.450
we had these giant airbags.

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:21.840
Has anything ever
seen videos of how,

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:24.450
sort of artist conception
of how these landed?

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:25.750
It's pretty wild, right.

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:27.560
I mean, they're all kind of
wrapped up in these airbags,

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:29.510
and then the parachute
drops, is descending

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:31.970
through the atmosphere and
essentially just drops it off.

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:35.350
And it just bounces and rolls
and eventually settles down,

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:36.820
and the airbag is
deflated in this thing,

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:39.870
the clamshell is open, and then
the rover just sort of stands

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:41.800
up in the middle of
this and drives off.

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.650
Well, Curiosity is
way too darn big.

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:47.000
There's no way for
Curiosity to fit in airbags

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.300
that could survive
that sort of thing.

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:50.450
It's just too much force
that would hit on the ground.

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:53.850
And so we need to come up with a
whole new way to land Curiosity.

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:56.860
And what the engineers at JPL
in their infinite wisdom came

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:59.530
up with is called Sky Crane.

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:00.830
And the first time I saw this,

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:02.440
I said this is the craziest
thing I've seen in my life.

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:03.740
There's no way.

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:05.040
There's no way this
is going to work.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.540
And I was telling Steph I've
now seen crazier things,

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:09.060
which makes me even
more concerned.

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:11.920
But, and the JPL
engineers would kind

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.010
of famously say this was the
least crazy thing they came

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:15.310
up with.

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:16.610
This was the least crazy thing.

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:18.790
And so we'll show you a
video of how this works here,

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:21.480
but basically there is no
packaging for curiosity.

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:24.440
Curiosity came down
wheels down, and that's it.

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.530
And it was ready to go.

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:28.370
So, okay, we had a mission.

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:29.670
We knew what we wanted
to do with it.

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:31.090
We had a new way
to land it on Mars,

00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:33.370
and then the question
is where do you put?

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:34.670
And this is a question

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:37.420
that we're actually deciding
right now for the next mission.

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:40.220
So Curiosity's twin sister,
or almost twin sister,

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:44.710
they're fraternal twins, is
going to be launching in 2020,

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:49.150
and we're now down to three
candidate landing sites

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:52.140
for the Mars 2020 mission, and
it'll be decided here at the end

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:55.180
of the year where of
those three it will go.

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:58.070
And so similarly there was
a long list of candidates

00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:01.650
for Curiosity, and it's not
just science that drives us,

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:02.970
there's engineer
requirements too.

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:06.730
So Mars' southern hemisphere
is a lot higher altitude

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:08.030
than the northern hemisphere.

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:10.670
And there's just not enough
air to slow us down enough.

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:11.970
You need more air
just to slow us

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:13.270
down as we're entering
the atmosphere.

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:14.570
So we can't land in the
southern hemisphere,

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:16.600
at least too far
south, and we can't land

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:18.720
in the high mountains,
and we don't want to land

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.240
in the really crazy places
like valleys that have lots

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:23.040
of rock walls and
dangerous things around them,

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.400
so we need somewhere
that's safe to land

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:28.840
at a low enough elevation but
also scientifically interesting.

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:31.010
And when you kind of
black out the parts

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:33.350
of the planet that's
not safe to land on,

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:34.980
you're not left with that much.

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:36.280
I mean you're kind of left

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:39.140
in this narrow band roughly near
the equator, kind of minus five

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:42.620
or ten degrees south to
like 15 or 20 degrees north

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:45.650
and at elevations below
like a kilometer or two kind

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:47.400
of below Martian sea level.

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:51.950
And so in that list, eventually
Gale Crater kind of rose

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:53.290
to the top, and the reason is,

00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:55.760
is because it had all these
different chemical compounds,

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.430
clay compounds, sulfates,
things like that,

00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:01.690
that on Earth indicate
the presence of water

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:03.720
and different types of
water and different ways

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.620
that water has interacted
with the rock.

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:07.780
There was evidence that there
was this river valley that sort

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:11.470
of flowed into Gale Crater
and maybe left some sort

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:14.990
of delta here or fan, and
somehow there were sort

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:17.110
of different signs that
water had played a big role

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:18.410
in Gale crater.

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:20.080
And so this is why Gale
was eventually selected.

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:22.630
And this is an artist's
conception

00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:24.980
of maybe what Gale looked
like billions of years ago,

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:27.420
and this is sort of an
Earth-like, or a picture

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:29.040
of Earth here at a
high mountain lake

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.280
of maybe what you can
kind of use as an analogy.

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:33.770
So probably kind of
salt, maybe was it salty?

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:35.070
It's possible.

00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:36.520
But, you know, you
have not a lot

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:37.820
of living things around it here.

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:39.690
There actually are some plants
there if you look closely,

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:41.990
but this is sort of what maybe
Gale looked like, you know,

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:44.460
three and a half billion
years ago or more.

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:47.930
And so we had a place to
land, we had a mission,

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:50.870
and then I want to show
you this little video here,

00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:54.200
which I think really kind of
shows well the whole evolution

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.310
of the mission and the
work that went into it.

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:58.540
I mean this was,
so this was 2003

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:01.360
that the mission was first
conceived of, and now it's 2018,

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:04.400
and we only landed in 2012, so
there's a huge amount of time

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.640
that it takes to
build these missions,

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:09.620
to develop the science case
for them, and then to go ahead

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:12.050
and actually get them to Mars.

of the story so far.

But you saw during the video
there, this is a picture,

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:04.620
so Curiosity has a camera
underneath it called the Mars

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:08.830
Descent Imager or MARDI, and
so MARDI took a video basically

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:10.570
as soon as the heat
shield came off,

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:13.500

down, never to be seen again,

way down to landing.

You can look it up on YouTube.

But here's another image here.

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:23.250
So this is the rocket boosters
there, you saw on the side,

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:25.350
sort of shooting off, and
it kicked away all the dust

00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:28.430
from the surface right in
the spot that the rover was

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:30.040
about to touch down on,

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:33.060
and so you saw all this
dust being kicked away,

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:35.870
and then this was one of the
first pictures that came back.

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:37.790
This is, we have four
cameras kind of pointing

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:39.180
to the front called
hazard cameras looking

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:40.480
for rocks basically.

We don't want to drive
over anything big and sharp

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:44.570
and pointy, and this is
one of those cameras.

00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:45.910
So we're looking out,
seeing the shadow.

00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:49.180
It landed kind of towards
sunset, and here's the center

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:50.620
of the Gale grater,
this giant mountain

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:51.920
which we called Mount Sharp,

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:54.970
and sort of where we were
headed from that beginning.

00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:57.500
So it was a pretty, a pretty
poignant image that, you know,

00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:01.320
this is sort of the journey
ahead as soon as we touch down.

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:03.770
And I was an active
fan here watching

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:06.180
from home before I
was a team member.

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:08.760
And if you look real closely,
this shirt is not brand new.

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:10.720
So this was 2012.

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:14.200
So Curiosity was supposed to
launch originally in 2009,

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:16.450
and there was technical
problems like happens in space,

00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:18.220
because space is hard.

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:20.450
And so I bought this
shirt like back in 2008,

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:21.750
so this was already
like four years old

00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:25.430
when we finally touched down,
but it worked out thankfully,

00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:26.730
and sky crane worked,

00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:28.470
and hopefully it'll work a few
more times because they're going

00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:31.180
to use it again in 2020 and
even want to use it again

00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:35.330
if we ever land something
on Jupiter's moon Europa.

00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:39.500
And so here we are, and again
this is sort of why it's

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:41.580
so important to have a
Mars exploration program,

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:44.350
because this is a camera
looking down, the HiRISE camera

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:46.880
on the Mars Reconnaissance
Orbiter, which has been there

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:50.080
for 12 years already
and is working great,

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.750
and looking down here and
seeing the rover tracks,

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:55.000
so here's all the dust that
got kicked away from the spot.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.580
You can see like the
burn marks basically

00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:58.660
from the rocket engines
on the surface,

00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:01.930
and then you can see this little
faint track that went over here

00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:04.750
to this area called
Yellowknife Bay.

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:08.210
And if you recall from earlier
on, you know, we wanted to get

00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:10.920
up the mountain because that's
where all these clays and things

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:13.010
like that, these
materials that showed

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:14.310
that water had once
been present,

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:15.610
were all up high
on the mountain.

00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:17.190
That's a long way
from where we landed,

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:18.490
and we couldn't land
on the mountain.

00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:19.790
You know, it was
just not safe enough.

00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:21.830
So we landed in this flat
spot, sort of in the middle

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:23.390
of the crater, and we
always knew we'd have

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:25.910
to drive a pretty far distance.

00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:29.660
But we went here just a
few weeks after landing

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:32.160
over towards this area
called Yellowknife Bay,

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.660
and this was believed to be
maybe just a, sort of a edge

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:37.530
of where that possible
river delta kind of flowed

00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:39.660
out into Gale crater
at some point.

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:42.240
And I wasn't even on
the team at this point.

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:45.430
I joined like very soon
afterwards, but I don't think

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:47.020
that anyone truly expected

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:49.890
to find what we found
in Yellowknife Bay.

00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:51.780
So one of the most,
the first things

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:53.180
that we found were
these types of rocks.

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:54.480
These are called conglomerates,

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:57.440
and you can see here there's
all these little imbedded rocks

00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:58.740
in the bigger rock.

00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:00.040
There's little chunks rounded,

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.340
and particularly
they're all rounded.

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:02.640
So you know, if you go
in a stream bed here

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:03.940
on Earth they're
all kind of rounded

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:06.230
because the water has flowed,
they've kicked up and knocked

00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:08.770
against each other, and all the
jagged edges have been smoothed

00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:10.070
down over time.

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:11.370
And a long time.

00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:12.670
It doesn't happen
in a day or two.

00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:14.590
This happens over years.

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:16.730
And these rocks are all smooth,
and then they're all kind

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:19.160
of congealed together into one
giant rock, and again that's

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:21.690
by the action of water.

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:23.680
And we get the same
thing here on Earth.

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:24.980
I mean if you handed me this

00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:27.330
and you dusted off all
the Martian red dust

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:28.630
and you handed me
this from Earth,

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:31.370
I couldn't tell them
apart, that's for sure,

00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:34.610
but these are the same sort
of, same sort of processes

00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:35.910
that are occurring
on Earth and Mars.

00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:38.310
You have a stream bed
that's flowing over,

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:39.870
rounding these pebbles
out, and then kind

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:42.570
of congealing them
together into one rock.

00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:46.270
And again, this is because
this area, and so this is

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:49.480
where we landed, and we
drove just over here and was

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:51.770
on the very edge of this
what's called alluvial fan,

00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:53.610
so this kind of delta,

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:55.320
this river valley here
called Peace Valle,

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:58.920
it flowed out into this,
presumably this lake or the end

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:01.890
of the river, maybe through
the, just kind of dried up,

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:06.180
we didn't know at the time, but
it reached all the way down here

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:08.930
that the stream bed or what
was left of the stream,

00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:12.010
and this was not just, this
was not just, you know,

00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:13.310
sort of inches deep water.

00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:15.950
This must have been a few
feet deep at the very least

00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:17.480
to create that sort of flow.

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:19.120
You can't just have it from
a little bit of a trickle.

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:22.200
You need to have a true stream
or river to create that sort

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:25.110
of motion, to round
those pebbles out.

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:29.810
So similarly, we found
these very fine layers here.

00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:32.790
You can see they just kind of
peel away almost like, you know,

00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:35.050
[inaudible] dough from like a
Baclava or something, right.

00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:38.370
They're just very fine layered
materials, and you can see here,

00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:39.890
there's, you know,
very small scale,

00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:42.300
these are like millimeters
thick sometimes or centimeters

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:44.710
at most, and they're all kind
of peeled away and then kind

00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:46.150
of got jumbled around over time.

00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:48.660
But again, this shows
that you have sediment.

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:50.870
So again, you have
suspended in a river,

00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:52.980
you have little tiny particles,
right, sand particles,

00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:55.460
dust particles, or whatever,
suspended in the flow,

00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:56.940
and over time they
sort of settle out.

00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:58.670
And so, again, like
the Mississippi River,

00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:01.380
you have all these deep
layers of very fine sediments

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:04.090
that have been deposited over
long, long periods of time.

00:34:04.090 --> 00:34:06.850
Kind of muck and mire
that has then kind

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:08.850
of solidified into rock.

00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:11.670
And again here on Earth, this
is sort of an ancient lake bed

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:14.420
in Scotland, 400
million years old,

00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:15.720
and you see the same
sort of thing.

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:18.090
Now these have been tilted up
by other geological activity

00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:21.380
over time, but you see
this very fine layering

00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:23.660
in this material here in
Scotland, and it's the same sort

00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:24.960
of thing we saw here on Mars.

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.420
So, again, another piece
of evidence that hey

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:27.870
that this was something
that happened

00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:29.370
over long periods of time.

00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:30.670
This was not a flash in the pan.

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:33.170
This was not days,
weeks, months.

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:36.220
This was years and
maybe even millennia.

00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:40.710
So we were the first time,
Curiosity has a drill on it,

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:43.250
and this is the first time
we've really drilled into Mars

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:47.090
and found that Mars has this
very peculiar color here.

00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:49.100
Mars is not red, it's gray.

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:53.080
Much more Earth-like, lunar-like
gray here beneath this red

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:54.380
Martian dust.

00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:56.300
And now that we've drilled
a couple dozen times,

00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:57.950
there's actually different
colors of different rocks.

00:34:57.950 --> 00:34:59.430
We found like purplish-colored
rocks,

00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:01.150
these more gray-colored rocks.

00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:03.490
Some have kind of a
greenish tinge to them even.

00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:06.010
And we've drilled in
here and then been able

00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:08.470
to sample these inside
Curiosity's laboratory.

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:11.030
One of the handouts out there
is one of the instruments,

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:14.030
the big instrument on Curiosity
called SAM, which was built

00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:16.040
at Goddard, and I'll
show a slide here.

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:17.750
The next slide is
actually about SAM.

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:19.690
But we take this material
here, we scoop it up,

00:35:19.690 --> 00:35:22.580
and we deliver it in very small
doses into the instruments

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:24.260
that are inside Curiosity's
body,

00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:27.850
and then we can really tell
what these are made of.

00:35:27.850 --> 00:35:30.930
So we did that, we dropped
pieces of it into it,

00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:32.410
and the point is
here that there's

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:33.730
that water came out of this.

00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:35.030
There was oxygen.

00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:37.020
There was sulfur-bearing
compounds,

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:40.570
and the different temperatures
that these come off of are sort

00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:42.900
of indicative of
what this is made of,

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:44.240
and we can tell what
the mineralogy is

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:45.540
of these materials.

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:46.840
And what I particularly want

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:49.190
to highlight is are this
material called carbonates.

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:52.280
So carbonates are extremely
common here on Earth.

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:54.870
The Cliffs of Dover, these
cliffs of Normandy here.

00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:56.880
You have hundreds of
meters or hundreds

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.540
of feet thick carbonates.

00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:00.440
And there's nothing magical
about how these are formed.

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:04.330
Now they can be formed by living
things, by little creatures

00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:06.680
in the ocean have like carbonate
shells and they kind of fall

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:08.980
out into the bottom of
the ocean, and over time,

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:11.180
like the whole bottom of the
ocean is essentially nothing

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:15.070
but tiny little fossils of
microbial life from the ocean,

00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:17.570
but they can be formed without
biological activity as well.

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:19.630
All you need is water
and then carbon dioxide

00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:21.490
in the atmosphere, and the
chemical reaction occurs

00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:24.750
by itself, and it turns to rock
and turns to carbonate rock.

00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:28.400
And so long ago in Mars
exploration we knew, okay,

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:29.820
if Mars had a thick atmosphere,

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:31.630
presumably it was
carbon dioxide.

00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:33.930
Venus' atmosphere is
all carbon dioxide.

00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:36.970
Earth's early atmosphere
had a lot of carbon dioxide.

00:36:36.970 --> 00:36:39.330
Mars' early atmosphere probably
had a lot of carbon dioxide,

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:41.350
and it would have needed to
if it was going to be as warm

00:36:41.350 --> 00:36:44.470
as it would have been
necessary to have liquid water.

00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:49.240
So there should be just a
absolute ton of carbonate rock

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:52.590
on Mars because presumably Mars,
all that atmosphere got locked

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:54.240
into carbonate rock
at some point.

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:56.500
And we've looked
and we've looked

00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:57.800
and we've looked
and we've looked.

00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:01.260
And there is not giant cliffs
of carbonate rock on Mars,

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:03.180
and if they're there, they're
hiding really, really well,

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:04.610
because we've looked everywhere.

00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:08.430
And so we wanted to know, like,
okay, there's little bits of it,

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:11.010
we found little bits, so
where did the rest of it go?

00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:12.880
I mean if there was this
huge thick atmosphere,

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:15.620
as thick as Earth's atmosphere
today, and it's all gone

00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:17.570
and it's not buried in
the rocks, you know,

00:37:17.570 --> 00:37:20.490
the only place it really
could have gone is space.

00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:23.560
And this is actually an image
from kind of a graphic figure

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.930
from the Maven mission,

00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:28.290
that mission that's studying
the upper atmosphere of Mars

00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:30.940
and how it's losing
atmosphere today,

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:34.870
and so but using the combined
work of Maven studying

00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:37.920
up at the top of the atmosphere
and then Curiosity right there

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:39.780
at the surface, we can
measure the atmosphere

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:41.660
and tell how much
of it has been lost.

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:42.960
And one way we do this was

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.810
with a particular type
of gas called argon.

00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:46.210
So we have argon
in our atmosphere.

00:37:46.210 --> 00:37:48.600
It's the third-most abundant
gas in our atmosphere.

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:50.220
There's your trivia
fact for today.

00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:51.730
It's also the third
most abundant gas

00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:53.320
in Mars' atmosphere.

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:54.800
And just like a lot
of compounds,

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:56.330
there's a heavy version,
and there's a light version.

00:37:56.330 --> 00:37:58.880
So have you ever heard of
like carbon 13 and carbon 12?

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:00.180
Same sort of thing.

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:02.710
So there's heavy argon,
and there's light argon.

00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:06.410
And if you have all that sort
of atmosphere lost to space,

00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:08.930
usually the heavy stuff is left
behind preferentially, right.

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:10.870
It's just harder for the
heavy stuff to get sent away,

00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:12.870
the light stuff gets
sent away first.

00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:15.300
And so that ratio,
whatever ratio of heavy

00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:17.720
to light was there
originally, that guy kind

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:19.860
of changed over time, right.

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:21.160
And it's changed on Earth.

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:22.460
It's changed on Jupiter.

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:24.250
It's changed everywhere,
and on Mars it's changed

00:38:24.250 --> 00:38:25.620
in a very particular
way that shows

00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:28.040
that it probably lost almost
all of its atmosphere to space.

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:34.360
And because of having Maven
there and having Curiosity

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:35.930
at the same time, we
were able to tell that.

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:37.820
Similarly for water.

00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:39.360
Water has a heavy version
and a light version.

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:40.660
Hydrogen does.

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:44.290
And so we can tell that that
ratio right now is really high,

00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:45.590
a lot higher than Earth.

00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:46.890
It's way up here.

00:38:46.890 --> 00:38:49.610
It's about six times'
sea water here on Earth.

00:38:49.610 --> 00:38:52.500
But by measuring with Curiosity,
by digging into that soil

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:54.590
and then measuring, because the
soil was created a long time

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:56.170
ago, billions of years, we note

00:38:56.170 --> 00:38:58.970
that that ratio was much
lower billions of years ago.

00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:02.230
So it's changed over time,
and it's changed because over

00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:05.500
that history from when that
rock was created until today,

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:09.150
Mars has lost an absolute
ton of it's atmosphere.

00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:11.160
And so three billion
years ago a lot

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.460
of the atmosphere
was still there,

00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:14.250
and a lot of the water was
still there, and between now

00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:17.180
and then, it's all gone away.

00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:19.430
So in Yellowknife Bay here,

00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:22.190
we had a really remarkable
find so early in mission.

00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:23.490
I think that was the key here.

00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:27.670
Three months after the mission
was sent, we found that Mars

00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:30.380
at ancient times was
capable of supporting life,

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:34.350
and not exotic life, like very
common life, life that we'd have

00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:36.580
in drinking water here today.

00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:38.040
Anything that's in here
could have survived

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:40.420
in Gale crater three and
a half billion years ago.

00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:41.720
There was the water.

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:43.020
There was the chemical
ingredients

00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:44.460
that we know life needs.

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:45.760
That was key.

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:47.360
And we've had even
sources of energy.

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:49.210
So different microbes
need different sources

00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:50.510
of energy to live on.

00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:51.810
It just doesn't need
to be photosynthesis

00:39:51.810 --> 00:39:53.110
or eating other animals.

00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:54.450
There's different
things that life can do,

00:39:54.450 --> 00:39:57.020
and that source of
energy was there.

00:39:57.020 --> 00:40:00.980
So the key takeaway here
is that at the same time

00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:03.500
that we know life was forming
on Earth, so we know that three

00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:05.260
and a half billion years ago
there was microbes living

00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:07.890
on Earth, in environments
very similar to this,

00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:10.400
where you had chemical
ingredients necessary,

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:12.880
you had sunlight,
you had open water,

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:15.480
and we know that life was
forming on Earth at that time,

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:18.300
three and a half billion years
ago, and at the exact same time,

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:20.880
Mars had that same sort of
environment, and we don't know

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:22.840
if there was anything living
there, but it could have.

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:25.460
You could have transported
any of the microbes

00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:27.260
that were forming on
Earth at that time to Mars

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:28.560
and they would have
been perfectly happy.

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:31.000
You could have transported a
trout from today to Mars three

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.300
and a half billion years ago,

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:33.930
and the trout would be
perfectly happy swimming

00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:37.360
around because the water
not only was pH neutral.

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.660
It was clear.

00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:39.960
It was clean.

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:41.830
It had all the different
chemical things that life needs.

00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:44.210
Low salinity, it wasn't
particularly salty.

00:40:44.210 --> 00:40:46.720
So we found, we kind of
hit pay dirt very soon

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:48.340
after the mission landed.

00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:50.240
But again, we didn't
sort of stop there

00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:52.080
because the whole point
of the mission was always

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:54.760
to climb this mountain and
see all these different layers

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:58.070
of rock that had been deposited
over long, long periods of time.

00:40:58.070 --> 00:41:00.230
And so we started driving,
and we've driven a long way.

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:02.020
We've driven 20 kilometers now.

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:03.320
And so here's just sort

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:05.900
of an image here crossing a
little sand dune here called

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:07.600
Dingo Gap.

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:10.060
We drove in amongst
these different,

00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:11.360
these different buttes.

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:12.880
So there is the rover
tracks here.

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:15.310
I like seeing these little
sort of circle patterns,

00:41:15.310 --> 00:41:18.030
so when the rover turns, it kind
of creates a circle in the dust

00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:20.730
because the six wheels together
kind of turn in conjunction.

00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:22.030
It's got all-wheel drive,

00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:23.900
so they can all turn
at the same time.

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:26.290
And you can see these
little turn marks here

00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:29.830
that winds it's way down, and
there it is again from orbit.

00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:34.270
And so we found other evidence
that the story of water

00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:35.930
in Gale crater was
much more complicated.

00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:37.710
It wasn't just a stream
flowing into a lake.

00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:39.240
There was probably
different episodes.

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:42.140
So there was long periods of
time where this lake was present

00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:44.550
and this river was flowing, and
then probably it would dry out.

00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:45.910
And then probably the
lake would come back.

00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:48.420
And then other times there
was ground water coming

00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:51.290
up from underneath, and so we
found these different layers

00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:53.510
of sandstone and other
materials that show

00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:56.530
that they were deposited by
water, standing surface water

00:41:56.530 --> 00:41:59.510
at different times
in Mars' history.

00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:02.060
Similarly here, so you
have these different layers

00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:05.350
that are sort of tilting
upward toward the Mount Sharp,

00:42:05.350 --> 00:42:07.350
that center of Gale crater.

00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:09.700
And so you can imagine here
you have this lake kind

00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:12.080
of overflowing here, and
you have rivers flowing

00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:13.380
into the lake, and you
have a different sort

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:15.700
of rocks deposited
at different places.

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:17.560
Here you have more
lake-like deposits,

00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:20.000
and here you have more
river-like deposits

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.140
that are farther
up, up the flow.

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:26.210
And so that sort of combination
of being able to drive across,

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:28.000
driving across all
these different layers,

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.520
kind of gives us
that full picture

00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:31.930
of how water interacted
on the surface.

00:42:31.930 --> 00:42:33.750
And of course the chemistry.

00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:35.980
So you see these
little white veins here

00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:37.280
that are mixed in the material.

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:40.270
So you have this rock material
and water kind of flows into it

00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:42.410
and percolates through,
like a coffee pot,

00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:45.270
percolates through these
rocks, and they interact

00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:47.420
with the materials and they
leave different minerals.

00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:49.850
So on Earth you get these things
all the time, and there's things

00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:53.800
like gypsum and other rock
materials that get left behind

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:56.490
as water percolates through
and kind of chemically reacts

00:42:56.490 --> 00:42:58.980
with the rocks that are
present in the first place.

00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:03.680
And so we saw these all over
the place as we drove past.

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:07.580
Here too, we saw sort of
difference of two layers here.

00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:09.300
So we had mudstones down here.

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:11.900
So if you imagine, has
anybody ever swam in lake,

00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:13.540
kind of not an ocean but a lake?

00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:15.830
Kind of mucky and muddy
on the bottom, right.

00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:17.820
Pretty gross if you
actually kind of walk

00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:19.200
around for the most part,

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:21.300
but that's because you have all
this different material that's

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:23.920
sitting in the lake and then
kind of settling down over time

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:25.870
and creates this
sort of mucky bottom.

00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:28.370
And this is what
mudstone is, basically.

00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:31.040
If you then take all that
lake away and let it evaporate

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:33.050
for a couple billion
years, you're kind of left

00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:36.260
with this dry, craggily
mudstone.

00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:37.830
And up here, you have
sort of sandstone.

00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:40.280
So you have sand dunes that
eventually get kind of hardened

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:42.290
into rocks over long
periods of time.

00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:44.730
And so you could see here at
some point we were at the bottom

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:47.210
of lake, and then eventually
sand dunes kind of came over top

00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:49.960
of it, and then those
hardened and those disappeared,

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:52.420
and then we sort of went through
these different periods of time

00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:55.130
where water was interacting
in different ways.

00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:57.690
So in that mudstone, you
see this sort of cracking,

00:43:57.690 --> 00:43:58.990
and this is exactly
what you get.

00:43:58.990 --> 00:44:01.450
If anybody has been to the
desert and seen like a,

00:44:01.450 --> 00:44:02.750
right after a rain storm,

00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:05.300
you kind of get these little
wet spots that then dry

00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:06.600
out really fast, and they kind

00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:08.090
of leave these little
cracks in the surface.

00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:09.670
That's exactly what this is.

00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:10.970
You get these little
cracks in the surface

00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:15.090
when the material dries out
after being wet previously.

00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:17.470
And so here's sort of a
version of that here on Earth.

00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:19.870
You get very wet surface,
and then it starts to dry

00:44:19.870 --> 00:44:21.960
out in the sunlight, and you
get all these different little

00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:24.360
cracks form over time.

00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:30.780
More evidence chemically
that the Mars was habitable

00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:33.690
and Mars had water interacting
it was these different veins I

00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:36.830
talked about just a minute ago,
and the particular chemistry

00:44:36.830 --> 00:44:39.040
in there called boron,
particular element,

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:40.730
again indicates that the way

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:42.680
that the boron is
interacting there in the rock

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:47.360
that these materials were
in place with water flowing,

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:49.440
and there were different
amounts flowing

00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:51.620
at different spots
along Gale crater.

00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:55.160
So, all right, I've
told you that story.

00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:56.970
Now, let me tell you
what I actually do.

00:44:56.970 --> 00:44:58.470
So if I've convinced you
that I'm a geologist,

00:44:58.470 --> 00:45:01.200
I've done my job, and I've
fooled you all very well.

00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:03.320
That's not what I do at all.

00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:04.620
This is what I do.

00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:07.180
I study the atmosphere
of Mars with Curiosity.

00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:09.640
And the atmosphere in Gale
crater is extremely dynamic.

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:11.250
It's really interesting.

00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:13.350
These couple of videos
here just sort

00:45:13.350 --> 00:45:14.650
of show some of the
things we see.

00:45:14.650 --> 00:45:17.330
And this bottom one has
a really funny story.

00:45:17.330 --> 00:45:20.590
So dust levels are
extremely common on Mars.

00:45:20.590 --> 00:45:23.470
The little whirl winds that
kick up dust that you see here,

00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:26.880
even on a windy day sometimes if
you're out in the field or like

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:29.410
on a baseball field sometimes
you see these little dust devils

00:45:29.410 --> 00:45:30.710
pick up.

00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:33.210
And they don't last very long,
and they, you know, spread dust,

00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:35.200
and they have strong winds
and that sort of thing.

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.970
Well on Mars they are
all over the place,

00:45:36.970 --> 00:45:39.640
and with the Spirit rover
we saw them every single day

00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:40.940
just about.

00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:42.240
They're extremely common.

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:43.540
We've seen them even from orbit.

00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:44.840
They're so tall you can
see them from orbit.

00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:46.220
They cast shadows
on the surface,

00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:49.410
and they leave little tracks,
dark tracks where they move dust

00:45:49.410 --> 00:45:51.070
around on the surface.

00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:52.780
And so for the first
couple years of the mission,

00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:55.780
we were dedicated to looking
for these dust devils,

00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:58.040
and we stared off into the
northern side of the crater,

00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:00.060
looking, looking, looking,
all the different time,

00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:02.240
saw maybe one, and
it was like really,

00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:03.810
you had to really stretch
the heck out of the image

00:46:03.810 --> 00:46:05.960
to even convince yourself
there was one there.

00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:08.190
And so a couple years later
we said, hey, you know what,

00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:10.290
we landed in a place, the
only place on Mars we've seen

00:46:10.290 --> 00:46:12.510
that doesn't have dust devils.

00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:13.810
And then someone said,
well why don't we look

00:46:13.810 --> 00:46:15.110
in the other direction?

00:46:15.110 --> 00:46:16.510
And we said, okay, let's
look in the other direction.

00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:19.730
And here they are, all over the
place in the other direction.

00:46:19.730 --> 00:46:21.030
So all we had to
do was turn around,

00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:22.330
then we would have seen them.

00:46:22.330 --> 00:46:23.630
But, no, we didn't turn around.

00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:24.930
We were dedicated to
looking off to the north.

00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:27.140
But here they are,
all over to the south.

00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:30.190
And so these dust devils on
Earth, you know, are what?

00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:34.220
Maybe like 50 feet high,
something like that.

00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:37.170
These can be the size
of like and F5 tornado.

00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:40.980
I mean these are big, like
20 kilometers high sometimes.

00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:43.870
These are big, massive
giant things.

00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:46.120
Now the force of the wind
on Mars is so much less.

00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:48.500
It's not like they would, you
know, pick up your house and,

00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:53.460
you know, send you off to
Kansas or anything like that

00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:55.370
or over to Oz or whatever.

00:46:55.370 --> 00:46:58.160
But they're pretty strong,
and they're really important

00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:01.320
for how the atmosphere
actually works in cycles.

00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:03.060
And so they're just
all over the place now.

00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:04.360
We're seeing an absolutely
ton of them.

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:05.890
And actually the season
on Mars right now is

00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:07.690
when we start seeing
a lot more of these.

00:47:07.690 --> 00:47:09.810
So we've started looking
for these again a lot more

00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:12.080
because we just left the
cloudy season on Mars,

00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:13.980
and we're entering sort
of the dusty season.

00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:15.800
And so these are images
of clouds on Mars,

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:18.190
and these are just like
cirrus clouds here on Earth.

00:47:18.190 --> 00:47:19.890
Now if you were standing
in Gale crater looking up,

00:47:19.890 --> 00:47:22.000
you probably wouldn't
see these very often

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.720
because they're very thin and
they're probably hard to see

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:26.930
with the naked eye, so we
kind of stretch the heck

00:47:26.930 --> 00:47:28.800
out of the image here, and you
can see them very clearly kind

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:30.100
of passing overhead.

00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:32.660
But they're very wispy, just
like cirrus clouds on Earth.

00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:35.550
You see little structures
in them sometimes.

00:47:35.550 --> 00:47:38.140
They're pretty exciting to
see, and we again are just,

00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:39.440
just left the cloudy season

00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:42.820
and now we're entering
the very dusty season.

00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:44.760
So we've been on
Mars for five years,

00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:48.290
and now we are finally
really climbing the mountain.

00:47:48.290 --> 00:47:50.070
So this was actually
an old image.

00:47:50.070 --> 00:47:52.790
So we are up right
about here right now.

00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:56.490
So you see we've climbed about,
you know, 300 meters or so

00:47:56.490 --> 00:47:58.800
of elevation since
we first landed,

00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:02.470
and we're finally entering these
different types of rock units

00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:04.050
and sort of chose Gale
crater in the first place.

00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:06.870
I mean that's why we went
here, and we're finally now,

00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:09.100
after five years and 20
kilometers of driving,

00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:10.970
finally reaching these places.

00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:13.530
And we're up high, and we can
look back out over the crater

00:48:13.530 --> 00:48:14.830
and see kind of where we came.

00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:16.720
And I thought this image
was just remarkable.

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:18.170
This was not taken too
long ago, because it's

00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:20.730
in the clearer season on
Mars when there's less dust

00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:22.680
in the atmosphere
because in a couple

00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:24.380
of months you wouldn't even
be able to see here the edge

00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:26.290
of the crater because it
would just be too dusty.

00:48:26.290 --> 00:48:28.240
But you see here, this
is where we landed.

00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:29.930
This is Yellowknife Bay
where all that evidence

00:48:29.930 --> 00:48:31.760
of water was found,

00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:35.760
and we crossed this dune field a
couple years ago, and now we're

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:39.260
up here on this ridge
that's very rich

00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:41.470
in a material called hematite,
which again is something

00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:43.930
that on Earth is very
commonly in place by water,

00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:45.850
and we're finding lots of
evidence of that here as well.

00:48:45.850 --> 00:48:47.150
But again, it's a
different story.

00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:48.450
The story is much more complex

00:48:48.450 --> 00:48:50.090
than what we thought
it was originally.

00:48:50.090 --> 00:48:52.010
There was lots of different
ways that water interacted,

00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:54.280
lots of different ways that
the environment was habitable

00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:56.750
at different times over
the history of Mars

00:48:56.750 --> 00:49:00.240
and over a long period
of time in Gale crater.

00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:02.140
So this is our route,
and this is as of

00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:04.200
about a week ago
or a little more.

00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:06.860
So here we are way up
here when we landed.

00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:09.210
That's just the distance we
drove to get to Yellowknife Bay

00:49:09.210 --> 00:49:11.200
where we found all
this evidence of water.

00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:13.760
And we've driven all
the way down here now.

00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:16.530
And so here's this ridge
called Vera Rubin Ridge

00:49:16.530 --> 00:49:17.850
that we're sitting on now.

00:49:17.850 --> 00:49:20.110
And then we're kind
of moving off

00:49:20.110 --> 00:49:23.140
into this next area here
probably later this year

00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:24.440
over the summer sometime.

00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:29.870
And so I'm replaying this
slide here because I want

00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:31.170
to point out clays here.

00:49:31.170 --> 00:49:34.780
So clays are really what has
been exciting for the geologist

00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:36.800
for a long period of
time because clays form

00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:38.920
with water present and
they are really good

00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:40.800
at preserving ancient
signs of life.

00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:43.820
They're really common on Earth,
where if you find fossils

00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:46.340
and things like that, clays are
a great place to look for them.

00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:50.590
And so we're finally just about
to get into the area of clay.

00:49:50.590 --> 00:49:53.840
So this is the clay unit here
that has yet to be named.

00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:56.670
We're kind of overlooking
it here, and we're going

00:49:56.670 --> 00:49:59.190
to be heading into this
area later this summer.

00:49:59.190 --> 00:50:01.440
So the story is certainly
not over,

00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:03.680
and I think there's lot more
that we're going to learn here

00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:05.290
over the next couple years,

00:50:05.290 --> 00:50:07.620
and hopefully we'll
keep driving along,

00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:10.750
because there's a lot
more mission to do.

00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:13.120
And I encourage you
all to follow along.

00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:15.260
This is the Twitter handle.

00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:18.150
Every day that we have
operational planning,

00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:19.970
someone writes a little
blog about what we do.

00:50:19.970 --> 00:50:21.270
I'm one of the people,

00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:23.050
about three times a
month I write the blog

00:50:23.050 --> 00:50:25.020
about what Curiosity is doing.

00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:28.560
And so I encourage you guys to
check that out, and I'd be happy

00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:31.340
to take any questions
you might have.

00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:32.640
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus:
Thank you very much.

00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:36.080
And he will repeat the
questions so we all hear.

00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:39.140
&gt;&gt; When you talk about the
dust storms, you know--

00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:40.440
&gt;&gt; Dr. Scott Guzewich: Yeah.

00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:44.280
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] the atmosphere
is just two percent of Earth.

00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:45.580
&gt;&gt; Dr. Scott Guzewich: Yep.

00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:46.880
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] how
is it possible

00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:49.630
that you're lifting anything,
or is that a [inaudible]--

00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:50.930
&gt;&gt; Dr. Scott Guzewich: Yeah.

00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:52.230
That's a great question.

00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:54.260
So the question was, with
the atmosphere being so thin,

00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:58.320
how can you have enough force
to lift dust off the surface?

00:50:58.320 --> 00:50:59.970
So that's a really good question

00:50:59.970 --> 00:51:02.020
because for a long time
people didn't understand.

00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:04.710
So we saw like evidence
that dunes were moving,

00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:07.060
and we said how are these, how
are dunes moving because we,

00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:08.690
just based on physics,
you should know what kind

00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:12.170
of force is required
to start a particle

00:51:12.170 --> 00:51:14.310
of sand moving along
the surface.

00:51:14.310 --> 00:51:16.690
And it seemed like you would
need just insane wind speeds,

00:51:16.690 --> 00:51:19.160
like 200-mile-per-hour wind
speeds for that to happen,

00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:22.150
which obviously should not
be occurring very often.

00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:24.970
And so in a little bit
more sort of refined work

00:51:24.970 --> 00:51:27.050
and working a little
bit closely,

00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:29.280
it looks like you still
need very strong winds

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:31.460
to get something to start going.

00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:34.540
So that first sand
particle to start moving,

00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:35.840
you do need something
very strong.

00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:39.760
Maybe not 200 miles per hour,
maybe 60, 70 miles per hour,

00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:43.270
somewhere in that sort of
range, but once something moves,

00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:46.520
then you don't need that sort
of force to continue it to move.

00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:50.420
So then you can drop down to
a much more common wind speed

00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:52.090
to keep it moving along.

00:51:52.090 --> 00:51:54.690
And so the way the
physics works there

00:51:54.690 --> 00:51:56.800
on Mars is a little different
than how it works here on Earth,

00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:59.850
where you sort of need that
speed to maintain it moving.

00:51:59.850 --> 00:52:01.670
But then Mars, that's
an atmosphere that sort

00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:03.850
of helps you out a little
bit once it's moving,

00:52:03.850 --> 00:52:05.810
because then you
can keep it going

00:52:05.810 --> 00:52:07.440
without too much more effort.

00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:10.470
And so that's how
we think, you know,

00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:12.480
you get a little sand
particle to move.

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:14.100
The sand particle kind
of hits the surface

00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:16.680
and it splashes off
little tiny dust particles,

00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:18.790
and then those get
lifted into the atmosphere

00:52:18.790 --> 00:52:20.490
because they're much
smaller and much lighter,

00:52:20.490 --> 00:52:21.940
and then they can just
kind of go forever.

00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:24.690
&gt;&gt; So how would you
represent the Mars winds?

00:52:24.690 --> 00:52:28.810
Was it something you would feel.

00:52:28.810 --> 00:52:30.110
&gt;&gt; Dr. Scott Guzewich:
Oh, right.

00:52:30.110 --> 00:52:31.740
So the question is,
would you feel Mars winds

00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:33.780
if you were standing
there on the surface.

00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:35.990
So if the wind was
strong enough, yes.

00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:38.830
So the force is about
a factor of 10 weaker

00:52:38.830 --> 00:52:40.330
for the same wind speed.

00:52:40.330 --> 00:52:44.190
So if you had a 100 mile per
wind on Mars, it would feel

00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:46.740
like a 10 mile per hour
wind on Earth, more or less.

00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:48.040
That's the force.

00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:49.580
So like the movie The
Martian where, you know,

00:52:49.580 --> 00:52:52.860
Matt Damon is lifted off the
surface and a boulder is like,

00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:55.320
you know, thrown into him and
the radio tower impales him

00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:57.050
or whatever, it's not happening.

00:52:57.050 --> 00:53:00.740
I love that movie too, and
my wife was like, you know,

00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:02.190
she's like, come on, is
that really how it would be?

00:53:02.190 --> 00:53:04.530
And I was like the one
science they got wrong was the

00:53:04.530 --> 00:53:05.830
atmospheric science.

00:53:05.830 --> 00:53:07.570
But he knew that it was wrong,
he needed a plot device.

00:53:07.570 --> 00:53:09.000
He said this in interviews.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.280
And he said that was
better than aliens.

00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:15.460
So no, that would
never happen on Mars.

00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:16.760
But yes, if you were
standing out there,

00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:19.710
like if a dust devil blew over
you, you would feel something.

00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:21.010
It wouldn't knock you
off your feet though.

00:53:21.010 --> 00:53:24.920
&gt;&gt; And has Curiosity
been hit by a dust devil?

00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:26.220
&gt;&gt; Dr. Scott Guzewich:
So the question is,

00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:27.520
has Curiosity been
hit by a dust devil?

00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:28.820
Yes, it has.

00:53:28.820 --> 00:53:32.350
So we have an air pressure
sensor on the rover

00:53:32.350 --> 00:53:35.170
so we can see a little
dip in the air pressure

00:53:35.170 --> 00:53:40.870
as the dust devil passes over,
and you can also just tell

00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:42.520
because the amount of
dust on the surface

00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:44.120
of the rover gets
blown off sometimes.

00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:46.760
So this was actually really key.

00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:49.810
So Spirit and Opportunity were
designed to last for 90 days.

00:53:49.810 --> 00:53:53.140
So Opportunity has been
there for 14 years now.

00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:56.480
And so that's really good
on your warranty, all right,

00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:59.420
and the reason is
because they thought,

00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:01.330
well the mission was just
going to die because the amount

00:54:01.330 --> 00:54:03.140
of dust would cover
the solar panels,

00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:04.720
and eventually you
just wouldn't be able

00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:06.990
to generate enough
power to do anything.

00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:09.860
And so there's this nice, if
you look at the power output

00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:12.040
from the solar panels on
Spirit and Opportunity,

00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:14.210
you see this nice, kind of
steady decline, and then boop,

00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:17.630
and it bumps up, and it
declines, boop, and it bumps up.

00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:20.260
And it sort of reached
the steady state now

00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:21.790
that they've been able
to continue to work

00:54:21.790 --> 00:54:24.710
with because they constantly
get a dusty devil to pass over

00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:26.360
and blow off the solar panels.

00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:29.640
Not completely clean, not
brand new from factory clean,

00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:32.220
but clean enough
to keep doing work.

00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:36.610
&gt;&gt; I was noting that in a lot

00:54:36.610 --> 00:54:44.570
of the imagery the sky here is
bluish as opposed to reddish--

00:54:44.570 --> 00:54:45.870
&gt;&gt; Dr. Scott Guzewich: Yes.

00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:50.230
&gt;&gt; That we found in
the Viking missions.

00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:51.530
&gt;&gt; Dr. Scott Guzewich: Yep.

00:54:51.530 --> 00:54:54.840
&gt;&gt; Is that [inaudible] or
better imagery or [inaudible].

00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:56.320
&gt;&gt; Dr. Scott Guzewich:
So the question is,

00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:59.740
why does the atmosphere look
blue in this image, for example.

00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:04.080
And so all photography
is fake, and that's why,

00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:08.080
because this has all just been
processed in a certain way.

00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:11.740
So it's called white balancing
basically where they try

00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:13.850
to basically bring out
the different tones

00:55:13.850 --> 00:55:15.330
of the rock better because
that's really what they're

00:55:15.330 --> 00:55:18.750
looking for, and so they white
balance the image to bring

00:55:18.750 --> 00:55:21.890
out the different tones in
the rock more at the expense

00:55:21.890 --> 00:55:24.340
of making the atmosphere
look very earth like.

00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:27.140
So if you look on one of
the, on these websites and go

00:55:27.140 --> 00:55:30.170
into the raw image
files, you can see in some

00:55:30.170 --> 00:55:32.990
of the color images the
atmosphere looks very pinkish

00:55:32.990 --> 00:55:34.830
and reddish like you'd expect.

00:55:34.830 --> 00:55:37.680
But when that happens, you wash
out a lot of the differences

00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:42.510
in color in the surface, and so
the geologists run things more

00:55:42.510 --> 00:55:45.160
than those atmospheric
scientists, and so they kind

00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:48.950
of white balance it to bring out
the contrast in the rocks more.

00:55:55.150 --> 00:55:58.460
&gt;&gt; If everything is grayish
below the surface and not

00:55:58.460 --> 00:56:00.510
that far, where did
all the red come from?

00:56:00.510 --> 00:56:01.810
&gt;&gt; Dr. Scott Guzewich:
Good question.

00:56:01.810 --> 00:56:03.420
So the question is, if
below the surface is gray,

00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:05.830
where did all the red come from?

00:56:05.830 --> 00:56:09.680
And that is a question that
people are still trying

00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:10.980
to figure out somewhat.

00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:12.280
So the reddish color
is the dust primarily,

00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:16.320
which literally covers the
whole planet at some depth,

00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:21.670
whether it's just microns
or even meters of dust,

00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:25.360
and so the dust has a lot
of iron oxide, so it's rust,

00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:27.240
and that's why Mars is
red, because it's rusty,

00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:29.800
and so that is still
an ongoing question is,

00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:32.910
is the whole planet
basically producing this dust

00:56:32.910 --> 00:56:35.760
at all different spots or
are there certain points

00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:39.440
that are kind of
preferentially producing it?

00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:42.000
And different people
have different feelings

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:43.300
on that topic.

00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:45.660
But wherever the dust came
from originally, it has been,

00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:49.350
it is covering the globe,
and it constantly cycles

00:56:49.350 --> 00:56:52.850
around between the
surface and the atmosphere.

00:56:52.850 --> 00:56:56.930
And so the whole planet is
covered in it to some amount.

00:56:56.930 --> 00:57:01.800
But below the surface,
yes, there is probably just

00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:05.400
as much diversity and color to
the rock that Earth might have,

00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:07.810
and so some of it's gray.

00:57:07.810 --> 00:57:12.140
Like I said, there's actually
sort of a family portrait

00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:14.810
of the different drill holes
that we've done with Curiosity.

00:57:14.810 --> 00:57:18.820
You can probably find
this online pretty easily,

00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:21.980
and you can see that some
are that very gray color,

00:57:21.980 --> 00:57:24.300
like I showed in the
image, and some have a much,

00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:26.900
much different color or
even a combination of colors

00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:29.470
because the different rock
materials they're drilling

00:57:29.470 --> 00:57:30.770
into are unique.

00:57:30.770 --> 00:57:32.070
&gt;&gt; Where the jets
blew at the surface,

00:57:32.070 --> 00:57:33.370
it looked like it
was darker anyway.

00:57:33.370 --> 00:57:36.270
So some of the dust would
have been blown off.

00:57:36.270 --> 00:57:37.570
&gt;&gt; Dr. Scott Guzewich: Right.

00:57:37.570 --> 00:57:40.690
So the question, when the rover
landed and kind of looked bluish

00:57:40.690 --> 00:57:42.490
on the surface, again,
that's sort of a,

00:57:42.490 --> 00:57:45.080
the blue is probably more
of an imaging processing,

00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:46.910
but it certainly was darker

00:57:46.910 --> 00:57:49.480
because the dust got all blown
away, and so you saw that sort

00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:50.780
of native rock color
beneath the layer of dust.

00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:52.080
And the dust, you
know, gets in the way

00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:53.380
of a lot of the measurements.

00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:54.680
So like Sojourner went up to all
these different rocks and had

00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:55.980
that little instrument
that kind of sniffed them.

00:57:55.980 --> 00:57:57.280
Well you know what
they detected?

00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:58.580
Dust. That's what they detected.

00:57:58.580 --> 00:57:59.880
Every rock was made of dust,
and so with more knowledge,

00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:01.180
so Spirit and Opportunity had
this little tool called a RAT,

00:58:01.180 --> 00:58:02.480
Rover Abrasion Tool,
which basically kind

00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:03.780
of ground the rock down as
much as possible to get rid

00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:05.080
of that dust so they could
actually measure what the rock

00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:06.380
is made of.

00:58:06.380 --> 00:58:07.680
And then we have, Curiosity has

00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:09.880
like a brush that'll
brush the dust off.

00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:13.020
The little laser beam on
Curiosity will make a few blasts

00:58:13.020 --> 00:58:15.090
to basically clear the
dust off a spot before they

00:58:15.090 --> 00:58:16.390
start measuring.

00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:18.850
And then of course the
drill can get beneath that.

00:58:18.850 --> 00:58:21.550
So we have tools now to
get away from the dust

00:58:21.550 --> 00:58:24.400
because the geologists don't
find it as interesting as I do.

00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:25.700
Yes?

00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:27.170
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you had indicated

00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:31.410
that there is particular
seasons, you know,

00:58:31.410 --> 00:58:32.800
cloudy season and what not.

00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:37.120
Have you then identified
systems and streams much

00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:40.520
like what we have here on Earth,
like the thing that happened

00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:44.150
in the Pacific and Atlantic that
indicate those weather patterns.

00:58:44.150 --> 00:58:45.450
&gt;&gt; Dr. Scott Guzewich: Right.

00:58:45.450 --> 00:58:46.870
So the question is
about weather patterns

00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:48.980
and whether they are similar
to what we see on Earth.

00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:50.780
And so the answer is
in a lot of ways yes.

00:58:50.780 --> 00:58:55.600
So there are storm systems
that for all the world look

00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:58.020
like a storm system, you know,
in winter time here, you know,

00:58:58.020 --> 00:59:01.520
with sort of a big comma
head and a big sort of front,

00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:03.670
you know, kind of
passing down to the south.

00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:05.860
So Mars will see things
like that very often.

00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:08.140
There are some differences
though.

00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:09.770
They're not quite
as chaotic on Mars.

00:59:09.770 --> 00:59:12.570
Mars' atmosphere is
much more regular.

00:59:12.570 --> 00:59:15.680
It doesn't behave as
chaotically from year to year.

00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:18.960
So if you were on Mars
on a given day, you know,

00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:21.180
and you went one year later,
particularly if you're

00:59:21.180 --> 00:59:22.650
in the first half of the
year where there's not a lot

00:59:22.650 --> 00:59:25.290
of dust storms, the weather is
going to be almost identical,

00:59:25.290 --> 00:59:27.070
you know, one year to the next.

00:59:27.070 --> 00:59:28.460
You know, you're not going
to get a lot of variability.

00:59:28.460 --> 00:59:29.810
Like, hey, one year it
was warm on this day,

00:59:29.810 --> 00:59:31.110
and next year it
was cold this day.

00:59:31.110 --> 00:59:32.440
Like this April has
been chilly, right,

00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:33.920
but last year it was warm.

00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:36.280
And Mars you're not going to
get that sort of variability.

00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:38.620
It's just a much more
regular climate just

00:59:38.620 --> 00:59:40.640
because the atmosphere
is so much thinner,

00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:43.610
and there is just not the
water around in the atmosphere

00:59:43.610 --> 00:59:45.110
to drive those differences.

00:59:45.110 --> 00:59:48.040
There's not something like an
ocean that's holding all this

00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:50.070
heat but then the atmosphere
can sort of interact

00:59:50.070 --> 00:59:51.670
with in complicated ways.

00:59:51.670 --> 00:59:54.040
With just the atmosphere there,
and a very thin atmosphere

00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:57.510
at that, it's much more driven
just by the daily cycle of heat

00:59:57.510 --> 01:00:00.550
from the sun, because the sun
heats the atmosphere during the

01:00:00.550 --> 01:00:02.750
day, and at nighttime
all that heat goes away,

01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:04.520
and the atmosphere
essentially hits a reset button.

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:06.540
It's like okay, the next
day it's a brand new day,

01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:07.840
start again.

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:10.400
And the next day, sun comes up,
dust devils kick up, you know,

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:11.820
clouds might be there
in the morning.

01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:13.120
Clouds go away.

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:14.420
Dust devils kick up.

01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:16.650
Sun gets turned off, and
the next day is a recycle.

01:00:16.650 --> 01:00:19.170
And the only big difference
is in the dust storms.

01:00:19.170 --> 01:00:21.750
Sometimes the dust storms
can last for days and days.

01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:26.560
And those are sort of the
one, you know, chaotic event

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:28.170
that Mars' atmosphere has.

01:00:28.170 --> 01:00:32.130
&gt;&gt; Are those effectively those,
those sand storms, right,

01:00:32.130 --> 01:00:36.500
dust storms, that I'm assuming
those are fairly predictable

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:38.670
in that like you can see
when they're occurring

01:00:38.670 --> 01:00:41.180
because of some sort of
system that's just going

01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:43.720
around the planet or
based on certain events

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:45.020
that happened in previous year.

01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:46.320
&gt;&gt; Dr. Scott Guzewich:
So, right.

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:48.090
The question is how
predictable are the dust storms?

01:00:48.090 --> 01:00:51.490
And the answer is, we know what
seasons they preferentially

01:00:51.490 --> 01:00:54.530
occur at and we know where
they preferentially occur,

01:00:54.530 --> 01:00:56.980
but we have no predictive
capability to say, oh,

01:00:56.980 --> 01:01:00.300
there's going to be a dust
storm here in two days,

01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:02.150
or this small dust
storm is going

01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:04.960
to become a much bigger dust
storm, you know, next Wednesday.

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:07.580
There's no predictive
capability,

01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:11.180
and people are starting to
look towards that sort of thing

01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:14.110
with [inaudible] some modelling,
and people are sort of starting

01:01:14.110 --> 01:01:19.010
to get towards that, but there
seems to be some challenges

01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:22.430
to that that don't exist
for Earth forecasting.

01:01:22.430 --> 01:01:26.580
And a lot of it boils down to we
don't understand why storms form

01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:29.110
in certain places or at certain
times in the first place.

01:01:29.110 --> 01:01:33.060
And so, and kind of going back
to this gentleman's question,

01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:34.380
you know, there's dust

01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:36.080
in different places
in different amounts.

01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:39.250
So maybe all the conditions
are right at this place,

01:01:39.250 --> 01:01:40.700
but there's not much
dust on the surface,

01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:43.450
so you just have this sort
of, you know, whatever spin

01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:45.910
in the atmosphere occurs, it
doesn't create a dust storm,

01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:48.030
but then the same sort of
thing happens over there

01:01:48.030 --> 01:01:49.340
where there is a lot
of dust on the ground,

01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:51.620
and suddenly you have a
big dust storm kick up.

01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:55.950
And that's a level of fidelity
that we don't understand.

01:01:55.950 --> 01:01:59.570
&gt;&gt; What's the temperature range
roughly where Curiosity is

01:01:59.570 --> 01:02:02.690
and does Curiosity work 24
hours a day, or does it have

01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:03.990
to shut down at night?

01:02:03.990 --> 01:02:05.290
&gt;&gt; Dr. Scott Guzewich:
So the question is,

01:02:05.290 --> 01:02:07.530
what is the daily
temperature range at Curiosity

01:02:07.530 --> 01:02:09.430
and does the rover
shut down at night.

01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:12.590
So the first question is, the
temperature range is huge.

01:02:12.590 --> 01:02:15.600
It can be like 100 degrees
Celsius in a given day.

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:19.720
It'll get down extremely cold
at night-time, down to well

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:23.610
over 100 degrees below
zero Celsius or Fahrenheit,

01:02:23.610 --> 01:02:26.660
and then in daytime, it
can get up to freezing,

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:30.770
even to like 65 degrees, like
right at the surface maybe.

01:02:30.770 --> 01:02:33.370
But then again when the
sun gets turned off,

01:02:33.370 --> 01:02:34.670
I mean the temperature
just drops.

01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:35.970
There's nothing there
to hold the heat,

01:02:35.970 --> 01:02:37.950
and it'll get extremely cold.

01:02:37.950 --> 01:02:42.340
And so because of that, yes, the
rover primarily does not do much

01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:44.250
at night, and when it does,

01:02:44.250 --> 01:02:48.320
it ends up being a
big burden on power.

01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:50.650
So there's only so much
power we have every day,

01:02:50.650 --> 01:02:53.020
and that radioactive generator

01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:55.930
that we have essentially
trickle charges the battery all

01:02:55.930 --> 01:02:57.230
the time.

01:02:57.230 --> 01:02:59.270
And so we run the rover off
of the battery, and so we kind

01:02:59.270 --> 01:03:01.130
of deplete the, you know,
deplete the battery,

01:03:01.130 --> 01:03:03.440
and then we basically tell
the rover to go to sleep,

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:05.820
and the rover's battery
can recharge,

01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:07.470
and then we start
doing something,

01:03:07.470 --> 01:03:09.430
and the battery goes
down and so forth.

01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:11.450
And so at nighttime, if
you want to do anything,

01:03:11.450 --> 01:03:15.040
you have to run the
heaters really, really hot.

01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:17.880
Because every little,
every little instrument

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:19.570
and movement has
it's own heater,

01:03:19.570 --> 01:03:20.870
and all those require power.

01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:22.850
So if you want to take pictures
at night-time, or if you want

01:03:22.850 --> 01:03:24.280
to take measurements
at night-time,

01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:26.660
you need to run heaters, and
those take a ton of power.

01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:28.830
And so we typically
don't do much

01:03:28.830 --> 01:03:30.170
at night sometimes
but typically not.

01:03:30.170 --> 01:03:32.470
&gt;&gt; You mentioned earlier
in the talk that sort

01:03:39.850 --> 01:03:41.110
of the atmosphere [inaudible],
and are you seeing any changes

01:03:41.110 --> 01:03:44.210
in the atmosphere currently in
your monitoring [inaudible].

01:03:44.210 --> 01:03:45.510
&gt;&gt; Dr. Scott Guzewich:
Right, okay.

01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:46.810
So the question is, the
atmosphere of Mars has depleted

01:03:46.810 --> 01:03:48.930
over time as the
atmosphere was lost to space.

01:03:48.930 --> 01:03:51.050
Are we seeing any of that
over the amount of time

01:03:51.050 --> 01:03:52.410
that we've been on the surface?

01:03:52.410 --> 01:03:54.840
No. So the atmosphere has been

01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:57.350
about the same every
time we've measured it.

01:03:57.350 --> 01:03:58.650
There's been a little
bit of variation,

01:03:58.650 --> 01:04:00.950
but it's all kind
of within the noise.

01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:05.020
So, we can measure, so the Maven
mission is measuring how much is

01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:07.370
being lost per day essentially,

01:04:07.370 --> 01:04:09.400
and it's like a couple
kilograms per day

01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:11.600
of atmosphere is
being lost to space,

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:15.710
and so we can measure that,
but you can just sort of do

01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:17.220
like a back of the
envelop math on that

01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:18.800
and how long would it
take for us to sort

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:21.290
of see any difference, and
it's still just, you know,

01:04:21.290 --> 01:04:25.920
millennia sort of thing before
we would see any difference.

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:27.960
Yeah. So actually,
when we first landed,

01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:30.620
we thought we maybe saw
some differences between,

01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:33.070
because Viking did the
same thing 30 years ago,

01:04:33.070 --> 01:04:35.730
and we thought maybe we saw
some differences between Viking

01:04:35.730 --> 01:04:38.890
and Curiosity, and now we sort
of think why we know basically

01:04:38.890 --> 01:04:41.060
that our measurements
are better.

01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:44.270
But so people wondered about
that very thing, but it seems

01:04:44.270 --> 01:04:47.630
like the answer is just
measurement differences.

01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:54.260
&gt;&gt; So, could the frozen water on
Mars be changed to liquid water?

01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:56.120
&gt;&gt; Dr. Scott Guzewich:
Okay, so the question is,

01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:58.810
could the frozen water on Mars
be changed to liquid water?

01:04:58.810 --> 01:05:00.380
Yes, certainly.

01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:03.530
It just needs heat basically,

01:05:03.530 --> 01:05:07.320
and there are certainly
particular places

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:10.970
and particular times of year
where the air is warm enough,

01:05:10.970 --> 01:05:12.860
and there's enough air pressure,
because that's other key

01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:14.780
that people on Earth
don't really realize.

01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:16.710
Not only for liquid water
do you need it to be warm,

01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:18.540
you need to have
enough air pressure

01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:19.950
to support liquid water.

01:05:19.950 --> 01:05:21.970
And Mars is right
near this point,

01:05:21.970 --> 01:05:24.860
this very interesting point
called the triple point

01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:26.790
where it's very close
between the boundary

01:05:26.790 --> 01:05:29.950
where water is either
gas, solid, or liquid.

01:05:29.950 --> 01:05:32.310
And the main condition,
the average condition

01:05:32.310 --> 01:05:37.110
on Mars is very, very
much almost at that point.

01:05:37.110 --> 01:05:41.060
And so yes, in certain places
you could have liquid water even

01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:45.220
today, and so when the Phoenix
Lander, this was back in 2007,

01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:49.160
the Phoenix Lander came down
near the north polar cap,

01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:50.600
not at the north polar
cap, but pretty close.

01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:54.190
So essentially equivalent to
like the Canadian high arctic.

01:05:54.190 --> 01:05:58.110
And it landed there, and there's
ice right below the surface,

01:05:58.110 --> 01:05:59.910
and I mean right below,
like within an inch or two

01:05:59.910 --> 01:06:02.150
of the surface is
essentially pure ice.

01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:04.910
And so because when it's rocket
engines landed it blew off all

01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:08.500
that dust and saw this basically
this little tiny skating rink

01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:10.140
right beneath the surface.

01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:16.020
And so the camera kind of looked
underneath of the Lander to see,

01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:19.410
look at that ice, and it saw
all these little droplets

01:06:19.410 --> 01:06:21.280
on the landing legs.

01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:24.950
There was liquid water droplets
on the landing legs of Phoenix,

01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:28.520
and it wasn't because water
was pure and it was, you know,

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:32.720
it was 32 degrees or warmer,
because if you've mixed water

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:35.080
with different types of salt,
you know, just if you imagine

01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:37.180
like sea water doesn't
freeze at 32 degrees.

01:06:37.180 --> 01:06:41.070
Sea water freezes at like 29
degrees for the most part.

01:06:41.070 --> 01:06:44.010
And so Mars' soil has a lot of
salt in it and different types,

01:06:44.010 --> 01:06:47.190
and so the salt makes
it able to be liquid

01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:48.670
at colder temperatures.

01:06:48.670 --> 01:06:50.160
And so this is probably
what happened.

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:55.640
There was little bits of ice got
kicked up, mixed with the salt.

01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:59.290
When the Lander hit the ground,
and it landed on the legs,

01:06:59.290 --> 01:07:01.640
and it got warm the
next day, and it melted.

01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:03.150
And so you had these
little droplets

01:07:03.150 --> 01:07:05.340
of water on the surface.

01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:09.900
And so if you want the whole
polar cap to melt, yeah,

01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:13.360
then you just need a lot
more, you need a lot of heat.

01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:16.420
You need a lot more
heat because most places

01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:19.210
on the planet are always
going to be either too cold

01:07:19.210 --> 01:07:23.780
or not have sufficient air
pressure to have liquid water.

01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:30.130
&gt;&gt; And also, might there
be some caves on Mars?

01:07:30.130 --> 01:07:31.430
&gt;&gt; Dr. Scott Guzewich:
So the question is,

01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:32.730
are there caves on Mars?

01:07:32.730 --> 01:07:34.030
Yes. There are certainly
caves on Mars.

01:07:34.030 --> 01:07:38.280
They've seen from orbit
signs of like volcanic tubes,

01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:40.060
so if you go out like in
California there's these

01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:43.360
like volcanic lava tubes where
lava used to flow through--

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:44.660
&gt;&gt; Hawaii has a lot [inaudible].

01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:46.150
&gt;&gt; Dr. Scott Guzewich: Hawaii,
Hawaii has these as well.

01:07:46.150 --> 01:07:49.460
And you can see these sort
of, a lot of times they'll get

01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:51.350
like a little hole in the
top called like a skylight,

01:07:51.350 --> 01:07:53.410
and you can kind of
see down that there's,

01:07:53.410 --> 01:07:54.980
hey there's probably a
lava tube underneath there.

01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:56.610
The moon has them also.

01:07:56.610 --> 01:07:59.280
And so they've seen these
from orbit around some

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:00.880
of the volcanos on Mars.

01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:04.580
And a lot of other caves on
Earth are obviously formed

01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:07.190
by liquid water kind of
flowing through, and so, yeah,

01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:09.620
probably there are those
types of caves somewhere.

01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:11.320
Of course, we just can't
see them from orbit,

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:14.340
and we haven't been on the
ground near the entrance to one.

01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:15.640
And even if there was one,

01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:18.190
there was no way we
would drive into it.

01:08:18.190 --> 01:08:20.570
[laughter] So, yeah.

01:08:20.570 --> 01:08:21.880
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: So
thank you all for coming.

01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:23.750
If you want to talk,
you can come

01:08:23.750 --> 01:08:25.870
on down while we're
shutting down.

01:08:25.870 --> 01:08:27.170
Thank you so much.

01:08:27.170 --> 01:08:28.900
