rewind the clock of recent evolution by

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950
rewind the clock of recent evolution by
 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.090
rewind the clock of recent evolution by
by remaking a hybrid for example and

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100
by remaking a hybrid for example and
 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.700
by remaking a hybrid for example and
then seeing how it evolves in the

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710
then seeing how it evolves in the
 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.529
then seeing how it evolves in the
laboratory or in the field and compare

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539
laboratory or in the field and compare
 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.049
laboratory or in the field and compare
that to what we know happened even in

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059
that to what we know happened even in
 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.569
that to what we know happened even in
recent history and so evolution is an

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579
recent history and so evolution is an
 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.260
recent history and so evolution is an
experimentally tractable topic I mean

experimentally tractable topic I mean

of the most famous branches in plant

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559
of the most famous branches in plant
 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.979
of the most famous branches in plant
evolution is the difference between

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989
evolution is the difference between
 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.219
evolution is the difference between
gymnosperms and angiosperms

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229
gymnosperms and angiosperms
 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.410
gymnosperms and angiosperms
and let me explain what they are they're

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420
and let me explain what they are they're
 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.050
and let me explain what they are they're
both seed plants so they have seeds but

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060
both seed plants so they have seeds but
 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.780
both seed plants so they have seeds but
angiosperms also have flowers

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790
angiosperms also have flowers
 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.020
angiosperms also have flowers
so whereas gymnosperms have a different

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030
so whereas gymnosperms have a different
 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.580
so whereas gymnosperms have a different
sort of reproductive structure account

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590
sort of reproductive structure account
 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.340
sort of reproductive structure account
so people would be very familiar for

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350
so people would be very familiar for
 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.620
so people would be very familiar for

example with cones on pine trees which
 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.499
example with cones on pine trees which
are gymnosperms and flowers on you know

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509
are gymnosperms and flowers on you know
 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.990
are gymnosperms and flowers on you know

difference between gymnosperms and

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259
difference between gymnosperms and
 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.719
difference between gymnosperms and
angiosperms is very important in

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729
angiosperms is very important in
 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.990
angiosperms is very important in
evolution because angiosperms were able

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000
evolution because angiosperms were able
 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.880
evolution because angiosperms were able
to somehow radiate into thousands and

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890
to somehow radiate into thousands and
 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.050
to somehow radiate into thousands and
thousands and thousands of species

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060
thousands and thousands of species
 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.600
thousands and thousands of species
whereas gymnosperms are rather narrow in

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610
whereas gymnosperms are rather narrow in
 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.569
whereas gymnosperms are rather narrow in
their in their species also gymnosperms

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579
their in their species also gymnosperms
 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.609
their in their species also gymnosperms
have very very large genomes that are

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619
have very very large genomes that are
 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.420
have very very large genomes that are
largely composed of transposons

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430
largely composed of transposons
 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.679
largely composed of transposons
transposons are pieces of DNA that can

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689
transposons are pieces of DNA that can
 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.319
transposons are pieces of DNA that can
move around the genome and so they they

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329
move around the genome and so they they
 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.380
move around the genome and so they they
can move potentially and cause genetic

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390
can move potentially and cause genetic
 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.780
can move potentially and cause genetic
as well as epigenetic changes without

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790
as well as epigenetic changes without
 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.420
as well as epigenetic changes without
having to go through a sexual cross and

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430
having to go through a sexual cross and
 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.330
having to go through a sexual cross and
most genomes are actually composed

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340
most genomes are actually composed
 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.940
most genomes are actually composed
mostly of transposon so for example the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950
mostly of transposon so for example the
 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.790
mostly of transposon so for example the
human genome is about 50% transposons

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800
human genome is about 50% transposons
 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.310
human genome is about 50% transposons
and only about 5% genes

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320
and only about 5% genes
 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.500
and only about 5% genes
the maze genome is even more extreme

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510
the maze genome is even more extreme
 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.870
the maze genome is even more extreme
it's about 80% transposons and only 2 or

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880
it's about 80% transposons and only 2 or
 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.140
it's about 80% transposons and only 2 or
3% genes so the bulk of the genome is

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150
3% genes so the bulk of the genome is
 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.720
3% genes so the bulk of the genome is
actually prepared if you like for every

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730
actually prepared if you like for every
 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.870
actually prepared if you like for every
genetic change and this is the area that

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880
genetic change and this is the area that
 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.590
genetic change and this is the area that
we work on the most looking at the the

we work on the most looking at the the
 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.690
we work on the most looking at the the
way in which transposon control and

way in which transposon control and
 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.940
way in which transposon control and
especially epigenetic transposon control

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950
especially epigenetic transposon control
 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.880
especially epigenetic transposon control

with his gradual change hypothesis of

with his gradual change hypothesis of
 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.340
with his gradual change hypothesis of

of the explanation lies in this ability
to to control transposons

to to control transposons

to to control transposons
but that's that's very speculative but

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010
but that's that's very speculative but
 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.630
but that's that's very speculative but
it's an interesting interesting thought
