00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:01.900
[music playing]

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:02.767
I've never been high.

00:00:02.767 --> 00:00:03.800
I'm nervous.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.133
I don't know how I'm gonna feel.

00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:08.133
See, Mom Aren't you proud?

00:00:11.233 --> 00:00:14.333
I've always heard that
edibles are just--

00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.767
put you on a whole
other type of high.

00:00:16.767 --> 00:00:17.900
What are we making?

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.433
Today I'm making
kenefeh, which

00:00:19.433 --> 00:00:23.166
is filo dough with
ricotta and mozzarella,

00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:25.767
and I have mascarpone
and I mix that up.

00:00:25.767 --> 00:00:28.300
Right here, you're
gonna see me infuse

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.800
with the water soluble THC.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.500
So you see how it is measures
out by the milliliter.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.066
So we're gonna go down,
just one drop basically.

00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:37.600
Can I smell that?

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.600
Yeah, absolutely.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.867
Do you smell any
cannabis in there?

00:00:39.867 --> 00:00:41.433
- I don't.
- Damn right.

00:00:41.433 --> 00:00:43.000
When you started
cooking with weed,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.667
was it just because you like to
get high and you like to cook,

00:00:47.667 --> 00:00:49.033
so bam?

00:00:49.033 --> 00:00:52.033
I was so sick of having the
brownies and the Rice Krispies.

00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:53.600
There was no other alternative.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.300
It was brownie or Rice Krispies
from every drug dealer ever,

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.500
and they all tasted
like [bleep].

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.800
So what I did was start to
put it into, like, puddings

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.467
and cakes and stuff
like that and then,

00:01:03.467 --> 00:01:05.600
it grew into a more
savory application.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.266
How do you know
what to infuse?

00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:11.567
Well, I infuse it based
on what I can control.

00:01:11.567 --> 00:01:13.400
Because it all comes
down to proper dosage

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.667
because if you get
people too messed up,

00:01:15.667 --> 00:01:18.800
it does not fare well for
really anybody involved.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.567
Now, you are about to
do something real big.

00:01:22.567 --> 00:01:24.266
We're opening up the
first cannabis-infused

00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:26.000
restaurant in the world, yeah.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.834
I know.

00:01:26.834 --> 00:01:27.734
I know.

00:01:27.734 --> 00:01:28.867
The first in the world?

00:01:28.867 --> 00:01:29.734
Yeah.

00:01:29.734 --> 00:01:31.066
Is that legal?

00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:32.734
There's a lot of things,
hurdles that we have to jump.

00:01:32.734 --> 00:01:35.900
It's gonna be done and it
should be done by people

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.433
that know what they're doing.

00:01:37.433 --> 00:01:40.100
I don't know if you've ever
been too high off an edible.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.433
I know you said that
you've never tried any.

00:01:43.433 --> 00:01:46.233
Chris, don't do that wink.

00:01:46.233 --> 00:01:48.000
For those of you
that have, sometimes it

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.300
can be extremely overwhelming.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.767
So we only put it in
certain ingredients

00:01:51.767 --> 00:01:53.033
so that we can control it.

00:01:53.033 --> 00:01:55.000
If you didn't want
cannabis, we can just

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.367
take that ingredient
out and replace

00:01:56.367 --> 00:01:57.867
it with a non-infused item.

00:01:57.867 --> 00:02:00.133
That way people can enjoy
the experience on their own.

00:02:00.133 --> 00:02:01.533
How did you come
up with your name?

00:02:01.533 --> 00:02:05.033
I didn't want it to be,
like, Ganga Chef or Weed Chef,

00:02:05.033 --> 00:02:06.667
so the Herbal Chef
was kind of natural

00:02:06.667 --> 00:02:09.467
and it also is THC,
the acronym, which

00:02:09.467 --> 00:02:12.300
is our beloved
tetrahydrocannabinol.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.100
- I'm just gonna take a bite.
- Oh, my god.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.000
It's so good.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.033
Oh!

00:02:16.033 --> 00:02:17.333
All right.

00:02:17.333 --> 00:02:18.934
So what do you say to
the people who have

00:02:18.934 --> 00:02:20.500
never tried an edible before?

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.900
We do it in such a way that
it gets you lightly elevated,

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.300
so that you're
never overwhelmed.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.133
You don't want to just
dive in right away, right?

00:02:28.133 --> 00:02:29.266
You want to dip your toe in.

00:02:29.266 --> 00:02:30.533
You want to take your time.

00:02:30.533 --> 00:02:32.567
You know, you just ease in.

00:02:32.567 --> 00:02:35.400
You can have a long, loving
relationship with cannabis

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.367
but you gotta take it slow.

00:02:36.367 --> 00:02:37.767
Chris, that is so good.

00:02:37.767 --> 00:02:40.133
You like it?

00:02:40.133 --> 00:02:41.700
Mm.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.333
Yo.

00:02:44.333 --> 00:02:45.934
That's where it's at.

00:02:45.934 --> 00:02:48.633
