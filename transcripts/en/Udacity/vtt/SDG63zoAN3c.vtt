Okay, Michael. Here's a problem I want you to solve. Let's imagine we have

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.020
two points. I'm going to call them X and Y, just so I can confuse

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.880
you with notation. And they are both two dimensional points. So they're in a

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.400
plane. And they have components X1 and X2 and components Y1 and Y2. Okay?

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.690
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.940
&gt;&gt; And rather than computing the X transpose Y, their dot

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.350
product, I want to compute the dot product of those two points,

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.560
but passed through this function phi, or phi. You got it?

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:37.640
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay, so. X transpose Y, gets turned into phi X transpose phi Y.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.310
What's the answer? What's the output? In terms of X1, X2, Y1, Y2. Go.
