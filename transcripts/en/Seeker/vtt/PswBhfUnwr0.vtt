00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:04.580
Earth can be a really loud place if you’re
searching for an extraterrestrial signal.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:05.580
Television broadcasts, radio transmissions,
cell phones - we’re beaming noisy signatures

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.580
of our technology into space all the time.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:07.580
But we’re not the only noise maker in the
universe.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:08.580
Black holes crashing into each other, fast
radio bursts, and other celestial phenomenon

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.580
create lots of astronomical background noise.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:10.580
So if there are extraterrestrials out there,
how do we find the signal through all that

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.580
noise?

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.580
The question of whether or not we're alone
in the universe is a question that's been

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:13.580
with humanity since you know we stared up
at the sky and wondered what was out there.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.130
But it's only been in the last about 50 or
60 years that we've had the technology and

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:28.220
the understanding of astrophysics in order
to really search 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:58.080
for these signals.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.250
Andrew Siemion is the director of UC Berkeley
SETI Research Center.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.050
SETI is an acronym, it stands for the Search
for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.150
To find a needle in our galactic haystack,
SETI uses a network of radio telescopes to

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.750
search for alien technosignatures.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.550
Which would look like a specific, purposeful
signal.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.260
Technology exhibits a very high degree of
what we call coherence which means that ultimately

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.700
electrons usually move in a very regular way
through some piece of technology.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.810
That means a signal from an extraterrestrial
would be consistent and distinct.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.640
That property of coherence is fundamentally
the way in which we tell the difference between

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.610
a natural astrophysical object and an example
of technology.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.520
When SETI first started we could only search
maybe 100 radio channels, maybe 200 radio

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.940
channels and we had to tune by hand.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:02.770
Now today 60 years on we can search 10 billion
radio channels and we can search them instantaneously.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.860
With recent advances in machine learning &amp; artificial
intelligence, SETI experiments can look for

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.009
a wider class of signals, and helping sift
the data.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.610
This is one of the biggest questions in SETI,
what part of the electromagnetic spectrum

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:16.610
should we search.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.790
We have radio light followed by infrared light,
optical light, ultraviolet light, x-rays and

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:22.790
gamma rays.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.350
The truth is that we don't know what part
is the best, so we operate experiments in

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.590
the radio and the infrared and the optical.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.940
While we haven’t found a clear sign of extraterrestrial
intelligence yet, there was one notable close

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.440
call that some consider first contact — it’s
called the Wow signal.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.530
The day after an observing run one time, one
of the scientists came in and looked at the

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.520
output from this dot matrix printer and saw
some sort of evidence of a signal on there

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.700
and draw a circle around it and wrote Wow.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.040
Today if we saw that signal we would have
so much more data on the signal that we could

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.490
very rapidly identify it as interference.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:08.850
By far the biggest challenge in radio SETI
is what we call radio frequency interference.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:15.560
Because we use our own technology as an example
of what we should be looking for we in fact

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.500
find many many examples of our own technology
and those examples actually pollute the signal

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.710
that we see especially with radio telescopes.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.629
Satellites that are whirling overhead — people
with cell phones, microwave ovens, and Wi-Fi

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:30.629
routers.

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:35.410
One of the most famous examples of radio frequency
interference in radio astronomy in the last

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.569
decade or so actually was ultimately attributed
to a microwave oven in the visitor center

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.280
of the observatory that didn't have the proper
shielding around it.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.870
It's telling the difference between the very
very distant probably very very weak signal

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.750
from an extraterrestrial intelligence and
the incredibly numerous nearby examples of

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.570
technology that are close to the radio telescope
that get into the data.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.950
So it remains a big challenge, but if we see
something, there are kind of very specific

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.110
tests that we can do and all the signals that
we found so far have been ruled out by those

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.110
tests.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:16.160
To date, SETI has only a few thousand star
systems, out of over 100 billion stars out

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.180
there.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.219
So the failure to find a signal through the
noise isn't evidence enough that there isn't

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:22.840
alien intelligence out there.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.740
At least, not yet.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:35.860
Despite 60 years of SETI, 30 or 40 years of
astrobiology, 20 years of exoplanet science,

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:43.050
sending landers to other bodies in our own
solar system — nothing.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:57.949
But, as long as we're able to continue the
search, it's only a matter of time.

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:00.900
