00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.660
So the project I'm going to talk about is
the Rosenwald School that was designed for

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:12.059
Hampton Institute, which was a teaching school,
an industrial training school in the Tidewater

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.570
region of Hampton, Virginia.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:19.560
It was a project that exists in very few objects
within the archives.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.109
So the primary thing that we have that represents
the project is this rendering perspective

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:30.039
that gives us a sense of what it would have
looked like had it been built.

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:35.870
When I first discovered and heard about this
project, I knew what the Rosenwald Fund was,

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.290
but I didn't know what the Rosenwald Fund
School program was.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:47.300
It started in 1917 and ended about 1938, somewhere
around then.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.850
But over that period, they built over 5000
schools for African American students, primarily

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.350
in the south.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.300
And what was fascinating about the Rosenwald
fund in general was that it was monies given

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.650
by Julius Rosenwald who was a philanthropist.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.440
He was Jewish, based in Chicago.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.660
And the monies provided a number of things
beyond the school program, but he funded artists

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.730
and intellectuals and writers so people like
Marion Anderson, the singer, Ralph Ellison,

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.740
the novelist, Jacob Lawrence who did the Migration
Series.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.940
But a large part of that fund also gave monies
for school construction.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.820
In terms of the Rosenwald Fund, Booker T.
Washington started the fund, and it continued

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.070
really and grew at Tuskegee Institute.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.940
Washington had this idea that if African American
communities could get some monies, part of

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.600
the money would come from Julius Rosenwald,
he would donate a third.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.530
The communities would raise one third, and
local school boards would raise a third of

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.610
the funds, that the quality of the spaces
of education could be improved across the

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:56.610
south.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.240
And so when you see the map of the school
building program, you realize the extent to

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.310
which these schools provided a service that
unfortunately under Jim Crow segregation was

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.860
not being provided, and the fact that African
Americans had to provide their own monies

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.670
even though they paid taxes in many of these
municipalities and to the state showed the

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.110
impact of Jim Crow segregation on education.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.430
The original plan that Frank Lloyd Wright
receives from the Rosenwald Fund is a building

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.620
that is a U shape with an auditorium in the
front of that U shape.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.730
And then you can see in the perspective that
it's more of a donut.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.490
And what Wright does is he takes the auditorium
and pushes it to the back.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:44.190
So by pushing it to the back, it opens up
an area that he describes as a patio and pool.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:51.569
And this provides a place for children to
play to swim and this ties into his own experience

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.820
in designing buildings, school buildings,
playhouses, field houses for his clients,

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.400
his previous clients in the Chicago area and
in Wisconsin.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.400
 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.989
One of the interesting aspects that I found
out about the project is that Wright had very

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.989
progressive ideas about education and took
projects that he had done for his white clients,

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.310
fairly wealthy white clients and was willing
to adopt those ideas for African American

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.310
students.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.020
But on the other hand, when you start to read
some of how Wright describes the project and

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:28.130
particularly the way in which he characterizes
African Americans as being childlike, enjoying

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.710
music and dance, bright colors.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.010
He makes a reference to darkies.

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:40.349
There's a sensibility about Wright that also
starts to allow for kind of cultural hierarchies

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:46.110
that are certainly a part of that time and
could be understood as being sort of part

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.590
of the rationale about how civilization would
advance, which was often talked about as white

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.430
civilization without necessarily describing
it.

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.850
I think it's an important project because
it's one of the projects that doesn't have

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.130
a big footprint in the archive.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.530
I mean, the archive is immense and enormous.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.349
And this is a project that has very little
evidence.

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:11.480
What's fascinating was how it touched so many
other archives, the Rosenwald Fund archives,

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.409
Fisk University archives where the Rosenwald
Fund papers are being held and so it, to me,

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:22.990
showed how Wright was interacting with a lot
of major figures and institutions of the day

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.220
that were engaged in progressive education
and reform.
