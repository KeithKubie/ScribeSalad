00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.660
We can't add this fractions yet
because 3-8th's and

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.340
5-16th's have different denominators.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.740
In order to add these two fractions
together we need to find something

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.320
called a common denominator.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.540
One way we can do this is to compare
multiples of the denominators and

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.850
see if any of the multiples
are the same.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.940
Some multiples of 8 are 8,

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.730
16, 24, 32, 40, and it keeps going on.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.150
Some multiples of 16 are 16,
32, 48, and on and on.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.360
What is the smallest multiple that
our denominators have in common?

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.450
That is what is the least common
denominator enter your answer here.
