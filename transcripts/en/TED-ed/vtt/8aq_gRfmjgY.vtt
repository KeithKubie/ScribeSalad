00:00:06.853 --> 00:00:10.682
After the French Revolution 
erupted in 1789,

00:00:10.682 --> 00:00:13.263
Europe was thrown into chaos.

00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:18.346
Neighboring countries' monarchs feared
they would share the fate of Louis XVI,

00:00:18.346 --> 00:00:20.304
and attacked the New Republic,

00:00:20.304 --> 00:00:25.876
while at home, extremism and mistrust
between factions lead to bloodshed.

00:00:25.876 --> 00:00:27.709
In the midst of all this conflict,

00:00:27.709 --> 00:00:32.061
a powerful figure emerged 
to take charge of France.

00:00:32.061 --> 00:00:36.174
But did he save the revolution
or destroy it?

00:00:36.174 --> 00:00:41.233
"Order, order, who's the defendant today?
I don't see anyone."

00:00:41.233 --> 00:00:44.119
"Your Honor, this is Napoléon Bonaparte,

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:46.604
the tyrant who invaded 
nearly all of Europe

00:00:46.604 --> 00:00:51.179
to compensate for his personal 
stature-based insecurities."

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:54.750
"Actually, Napoléon was 
at least average height for his time.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.159
The idea that he was short comes
only from British wartime propaganda.

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:01.541
And he was no tyrant.

00:01:01.541 --> 00:01:04.337
He was safeguarding the young Republic
from being crushed

00:01:04.337 --> 00:01:06.595
by the European monarchies."

00:01:06.595 --> 00:01:10.812
"By overthrowing its government
and seizing power himself?"

00:01:10.812 --> 00:01:14.862
"Your Honor, as a young and successful
military officer,

00:01:14.862 --> 00:01:17.731
Napoléon fully supported 
the French Revolution,

00:01:17.731 --> 00:01:21.950
and its ideals of liberty, equality,
and fraternity.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.397
But the revolutionaries were incapable
of real leadership.

00:01:25.397 --> 00:01:28.575
Robespierre and the Jacobins
who first came to power

00:01:28.575 --> 00:01:32.081
unleashed a reign of terror
on the population,

00:01:32.081 --> 00:01:34.111
with their anti-Catholic extremism

00:01:34.111 --> 00:01:38.979
and nonstop executions of everyone
who disagreed with them.

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.291
And The Directory that replaced them
was an unstable and incompetent oligarchy.

00:01:44.291 --> 00:01:48.987
They needed a strong leader who could
govern wisely and justly."

00:01:48.987 --> 00:01:51.595
"So, France went through 
that whole revolution

00:01:51.595 --> 00:01:54.590
just to end up with 
another all-powerful ruler?"

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:55.811
"Not quite.

00:01:55.811 --> 00:01:58.961
Napoléon's new powers were derived
from the constitution

00:01:58.961 --> 00:02:02.733
that was approved by a popular vote
in the Consulate."

00:02:02.733 --> 00:02:08.201
"Ha! The constitution was practically dictated
at gunpoint in a military coup,

00:02:08.201 --> 00:02:10.334
and the public only accepted the tyrant

00:02:10.334 --> 00:02:14.025
because they were tired 
of constant civil war."

00:02:14.025 --> 00:02:15.548
"Be that as it may,

00:02:15.548 --> 00:02:19.076
Napoléon introduced a new constitution
and a legal code

00:02:19.076 --> 00:02:23.591
that kept some of the most important
achievements of the revolution in tact:

00:02:23.591 --> 00:02:24.908
freedom of religion

00:02:24.908 --> 00:02:26.833
abolition of hereditary privilege,

00:02:26.833 --> 00:02:30.348
and equality before the law for all men."

00:02:30.348 --> 00:02:32.855
"All men, indeed.

00:02:32.855 --> 00:02:35.690
He deprived women of the rights
that the revolution had given them

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.099
and even reinstated slavery
in the French colonies.

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:42.705
Haiti is still recovering from 
the consequences centuries later.

00:02:42.705 --> 00:02:45.097
What kind of equality is that?"

00:02:45.097 --> 00:02:48.495
"The only kind that could be stably
maintained at the time,

00:02:48.495 --> 00:02:51.354
and still far ahead of France's neighbors."

00:02:51.354 --> 00:02:54.224
"Speaking of neighbors, what was with
all the invasions?"

00:02:54.224 --> 00:02:56.094
"Great question, Your Honor."

00:02:56.094 --> 00:02:58.154
"Which invasions are we talking about?

00:02:58.154 --> 00:03:01.173
It was the neighboring empires
who had invaded France

00:03:01.173 --> 00:03:03.007
trying to restore the monarchy,

00:03:03.007 --> 00:03:05.779
and prevent the spread of liberty
across Europe,

00:03:05.779 --> 00:03:08.193
twice by the time Napoléon took charge.

00:03:08.193 --> 00:03:12.057
Having defended France as a soldier
and a general in those wars,

00:03:12.057 --> 00:03:15.470
he knew that the best defense
is a good offense."

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.721
"An offense against the entire continent?

00:03:17.721 --> 00:03:20.134
Peace was secured by 1802,

00:03:20.134 --> 00:03:23.876
and other European powers recognized
the new French Regime.

00:03:23.876 --> 00:03:28.533
But Bonaparte couldn't rest unless 
he had control of the whole continent,

00:03:28.533 --> 00:03:30.563
and all he knew was fighting.

00:03:30.563 --> 00:03:34.011
He tried to enforce a European-wide
blockade of Britain,

00:03:34.011 --> 00:03:36.547
invaded any country that didn't comply,

00:03:36.547 --> 00:03:39.926
and launched more wars 
to hold onto his gains.

00:03:39.926 --> 00:03:41.089
And what was the result?

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:43.346
Millions dead all over the continent,

00:03:43.346 --> 00:03:46.050
and the whole 
international order shattered."

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.816
"You forgot the other result:

00:03:47.816 --> 00:03:51.587
the spread of democratic 
and liberal ideals across Europe.

00:03:51.587 --> 00:03:54.605
It was thanks to Napoléon that
the continent was reshaped

00:03:54.605 --> 00:03:59.408
from a chaotic patchwork of fragmented
feudal and religious territories

00:03:59.408 --> 00:04:03.324
into efficient, modern, 
and secular nation states

00:04:03.324 --> 00:04:07.608
where the people held more power
and rights than ever before."

00:04:07.608 --> 00:04:10.665
"Should we also thank him
for the rise of nationalism

00:04:10.665 --> 00:04:13.276
and the massive increase in army sizes?

00:04:13.276 --> 00:04:16.368
You can see how well that turned out
a century later."

00:04:16.368 --> 00:04:20.474
"So what would European history have been
like if it weren't for Napoléon?"

00:04:20.474 --> 00:04:24.261
"Unimaginably better/worse."

00:04:24.261 --> 00:04:29.850
Napoléon seemingly unstoppable momentum
would die in the Russian winter snows,

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.823
along with most of his army.

00:04:31.823 --> 00:04:34.295
But even after being deposed
and exiled,

00:04:34.295 --> 00:04:36.164
he refused to give up,

00:04:36.164 --> 00:04:41.474
escaping from his prison and launching
a bold attempt at restoring his empire

00:04:41.474 --> 00:04:45.657
before being defeated for the second
and final time.

00:04:45.657 --> 00:04:48.133
Bonaparte was 
a ruler full of contradictions,

00:04:48.133 --> 00:04:53.023
defending a popular revolution
by imposing absolute dictatorship,

00:04:53.023 --> 00:04:57.309
and spreading liberal ideals
through imperial wars,

00:04:57.309 --> 00:05:00.559
and though he never achieved his dream
of conquering Europe,

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:05.349
he undoubtedly left his mark on it,
for better or for worse.
