What's one interview question you ask every prospective employee?

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.359
So, I often ask questions

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:11.862
for people to describe an experience they've had before.

00:00:11.862 --> 00:00:13.271
But when I'm interviewing,

00:00:13.271 --> 00:00:15.132
I'm also recruiting.

00:00:15.132 --> 00:00:17.611
So, if you're interviewing for a job,

00:00:17.611 --> 00:00:19.272
realize that the person interviewing you

00:00:19.272 --> 00:00:23.141
is also at the same time trying to

00:00:23.141 --> 00:00:28.028
show how great their job is.

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:30.992
And so there are cues where you can acknowledge that

00:00:30.992 --> 00:00:32.267
or show that you're listening,

00:00:32.267 --> 00:00:33.659
show that you appreciate that.

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:35.998
So, in addition to trying to just answer questions,

00:00:35.998 --> 00:00:38.591
I think picking up on that dynamic

00:00:38.591 --> 00:00:41.220
can give someone a competitive advantage in an interview.
