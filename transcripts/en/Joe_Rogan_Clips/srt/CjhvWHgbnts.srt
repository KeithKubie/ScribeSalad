1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,710
You know,
when you go to Russia,

2
00:00:01,711 --> 00:00:03,930
you take that attitude like let's
just see what the experience,

3
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:05,860
so you have your own
experience of what Russia's,

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,490
I'm going to have my own expansion.
I let it be what anyone else's.

5
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,330
And also I had been to Russia before I
went in [inaudible] 95 I used to work for

6
00:00:12,331 --> 00:00:14,160
a company that made documentaries,
these guys,

7
00:00:14,161 --> 00:00:15,870
and I ended up going along
to help him out with,

8
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:20,160
it was the first time I'd ever left. The
U S is a big, uh, had a big effect on me.

9
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:24,930
So I, um, do you know how to speak
it? No, no, no, no. I mean, I can't,

10
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,670
I can do my, I can do my instructions
it, and I know some words. I mean,

11
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,250
I took some time to learn how to use
the alphabet so I can get around,

12
00:00:32,251 --> 00:00:34,380
you know what I mean? It's
crazy. Yeah. And so, you know,

13
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:39,470
it's like Celtic ancient cyrillic or
what it's called. Is that what it is?

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,380
It's a guy named surreal. So I
thought, well, how the cyrillic yet,

15
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,980
but it's actually named after a guy who
made it. That's the, the Russian stuff.

16
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:50,490
What does that Celtic stuff that you
know, that you know the, Oh yeah, those,

17
00:00:50,491 --> 00:00:54,300
those rooms. The little
rooms or something? Yeah.
It looks like, yeah. Yeah.

18
00:00:54,301 --> 00:00:57,540
The letters in Russia. Like why is it
that, why would they do it backwards?

19
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,900
Like it's the same letter that
we have, but it's backwards.
Right? Right. Yeah. Yeah.

20
00:01:00,901 --> 00:01:02,970
That's a, yeah. You're talking
about, is that what it is?

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,610
He has the one that looks like a backwards
are. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's,

22
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,870
that's what they, that's the,
yeah. What does that stand
for over there? Just means,

23
00:01:09,871 --> 00:01:13,860
yeah. Yeah. And as you use it,
like I told you that, that chaos.

24
00:01:13,861 --> 00:01:16,150
So that's how you say I, you said, yeah,

25
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,440
look at their fucking language
and look what's up with that age.

26
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,880
What's up with that? Ups Ages
and ages. The end. Why? But
that's how you use it in.

27
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,020
Oh my God. So like when you,
so once you get used to read,

28
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,940
so you always see pectoral
pile everywhere you go. Right.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,500
What's that Lebanese restaurant?
What's the upside down? Little Age.

30
00:01:32,501 --> 00:01:35,880
So it looks like a candle holder.
Yeah. Right there. What's that? Yeah,

31
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,850
that's an upside down h uh huh.
What happened there?

32
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:44,670
So we took that h and dumped it on its
head but, but it looks like h doesn't it?

33
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,230
Like if you flipped it upside down,
it's WIC. The look at the e below that.

34
00:01:49,231 --> 00:01:53,490
Like what the fuck is that thing? And so
that's a yacht that that backwards are.

35
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:54,663
Yeah.
Yeah.

36
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,710
So you would say you would use it like Ja
and say that word when you use it like,

37
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:03,900
and like just how we use I,
oh, I and we usually like I,

38
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,590
and then we might use it in another
reason too. Yeah. Wow. Yeah.

39
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,390
Thorough.

40
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:14,390
I mean it is kind of amazing how different
the way we write is to the way Asian

41
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:19,620
folks do. That's right. That
real freak out. That's, and I,

42
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,240
I think you just have to learn
it, right. Each one of them,

43
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:27,470
you have to learn each and every
one of those there. Demi, it seems,

44
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:30,240
it looks like it's pretty hard to learn.
Well it looks,

45
00:02:30,241 --> 00:02:34,450
especially if it's not
completely ingrained in your
memory as a child because I

46
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,400
ended up late in life.

47
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,400
I know there's some people who speak
mandarin but they can't write it. Yeah,

48
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:43,530
that's right. And you didn't write
it. Yeah. Fuck man. It's alien.

49
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,000
Alien.

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I mean the fact that whole different side
of the world writes that way and these

51
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:52,890
little characters. So I do have
some help when I go over there.

52
00:02:52,891 --> 00:02:53,790
I'm going to tell you something.

53
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:59,060
I got married a few years ago and my
wife is Russian. Ah, there you go. Yeah,

54
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:02,250
and she speaks Chinese. So when I got
to China reads and writes Chinese.

55
00:03:02,251 --> 00:03:06,520
So when we go to these
countries and rights, yes. It's
easier to learn. Yeah. Wow.

56
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,610
An English or no English. Yeah.
You get along. We get along because

57
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,930
some people are good with
languages. Man, that's a grubber.

58
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,080
Spanish is better than mine are
already just got here to have Russian,

59
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:21,160
which has its own use of the
alphabet and then Chinese,

60
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,540
which is another whole deal.

61
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,800
N English just does she have room
in our head for anything else?

62
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:31,240
I know hard drive would be full. Yeah.
That's this is those three languages.

63
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:34,810
Like fuck three hard languages.
Right. Probably the hardest.

64
00:03:34,811 --> 00:03:37,970
I heard the rushes hard and English.
Well I'm not going to say hurt.

65
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,970
I tried to allow me to try and learn it.
It's hard.

66
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:43,450
There's so many ways to say
something cause they conjugate a lot.

67
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,540
I think they a lot more than Spanish real.
And that's what I have problems with.

68
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,160
You know,
we all get Spanish words,

69
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:51,010
we live in La but conjugating
verbs that you know,

70
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:55,000
but she can do it easy cause she's like
aw cause they conjugate so much more.

71
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,970
Yeah. It's, that's,

72
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,590
this might be the three hardest language
to learn outside of maybe the other one.

73
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,080
Other Asian languages like Japanese
is probably pretty difficult.

74
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,740
I heard the Vietnamese is
tough. Yeah. And then you know,

75
00:04:08,741 --> 00:04:11,080
you've got those languages that you
look at, you know. Wow, that's great.

76
00:04:11,081 --> 00:04:12,670
And then you see like ancient Hebrew,

77
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:16,780
you look at Hebrew language like the
way they write. Like what the fuck?

78
00:04:16,781 --> 00:04:20,470
I don't know. I bet Arabic stuff
Arabics gotta be tough. I mean,

79
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:24,250
how many languages are there?
If you had to guess. Yeah,

80
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:29,860
a hundred days doesn't dialects and
depending on like where you are.

81
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:33,190
Even in Mexico there's different, yeah,
speak the same Spanish down there.

82
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:36,460
Even in Spanish he had like you
can under like, cause you know,

83
00:04:36,461 --> 00:04:40,600
I took a couple of Spanish classes. Right.
But I can understand people from, from,

84
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:44,350
you know, uh, Spain easier for
some reason I grew up right here.

85
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,380
It's harder for me to understand
that the way they speak Spanish,

86
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,640
my friend lives in, um, my friend Adam
Green tree, he lives in Australia and uh,

87
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:56,110
he has a lot of experience with like the
indigenous people that live there cause

88
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:00,070
he uh,
works in a mining company and they,

89
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:03,330
they deal with a lot of
the aborigines and um,

90
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:07,030
they have the groups of
people they call the mobs.

91
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:12,180
That's what they call themselves instead
of like a village or clan or the coals

92
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:15,400
off a mob. That's what,
that's what aborigines shoes.

93
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,790
And they have different
languages for different moms.

94
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:23,410
So like there might be hundreds of mobs
in this area and they all have different

95
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:27,340
languages. So you drive. I go how
close? He was like a few miles.

96
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:30,100
I go a few miles,
you know he'd say kilometers,

97
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,870
it might make 2000 kilometers like so you
go to a hundred kilometers and you got

98
00:05:34,871 --> 00:05:38,590
a totally different language.
Oh that's all the different languages.

99
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,980
Is that map of all the things
that maybe they're similar, right.

100
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,350
Areas of the moms?
I don't believe so.

101
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,350
I think they don't know what the fuck
each other is saying. Right, right.

102
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:51,310
That's why we can't understand
Australians. Right. Cause
if you look at that,

103
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:56,200
that's crazy. Yeah. Like I
don't know who's documenting
all this stuff and what a,

104
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,890
whether or not they've saved these
languages and they, they have it.

105
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:04,610
Cause it's very likely that like
little ones of them will just go,

106
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:08,600
you know, if this people assimilate
other populations or, or move out,

107
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,650
like you might lose these languages.
Yeah.

108
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,290
There's something I like
about going to Russia to,

109
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:15,560
cause there's so many different cultures
and so many people and I liked it.

110
00:06:15,561 --> 00:06:20,090
I like people like I get that, I get
the like a, I get to go to Graziani.

111
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,920
It'd been got to, I've been to Dagestan
to Graziani is in Chechnya. Yeah.

112
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,860
What's that like? It's really,
it was a really cool place.

113
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:32,230
I went to a show you some pictures, went
to uh, uh, went and looked around. What,

114
00:06:32,231 --> 00:06:32,721
because it's,

115
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:36,200
for me what's really cool about it
is the energy that people have about

116
00:06:36,201 --> 00:06:39,050
developing over there right now. Because
the place, there was a war there,

117
00:06:39,051 --> 00:06:40,760
you know about that, right? Yeah.

118
00:06:40,761 --> 00:06:45,620
There was a war and a right now and
they're really building up and they're

119
00:06:45,621 --> 00:06:47,900
really excited about it.
So I think it's just, uh,

120
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:52,680
it's cool to go and see
people who are really, uh,

121
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:56,630
see I kind of a group of mentality
about moving forward, you know?

122
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,820
So what, where exactly is this
and what was their war? You're,

123
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,350
you've heard of Chechnya. Yeah. Yeah. So
they had a war with Russia, I civil war.

124
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,280
So see that's what it used to look like.
Yeah. Now you've got a picture of it now,

125
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:14,870
right? Yeah. So it's there.
Ah, there it is now rebuilding.

126
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,990
Yeah. And there that rebuilt
their, their energetic about it,

127
00:07:17,991 --> 00:07:19,060
and there's prior to then,

128
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,800
and it's cool as a coach to be
able to go there and get to see it.

129
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,200
That is cool to see something in the
middle of a rebirth like that. Right.

130
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,980
It's beautiful. And in that
area, a lot of places. Yeah,

131
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:31,220
there's a lot of rebirth energy going on.
Oh Wow.

132
00:07:31,221 --> 00:07:35,630
So that's what it looked like
right after the war. God Damn. Wow.

133
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,710
That's a crazy image.
