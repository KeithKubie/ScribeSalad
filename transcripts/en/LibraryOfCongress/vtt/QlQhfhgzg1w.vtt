&gt;&gt; Jon Parrish Peede:
Good morning.

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.450
And welcome to the
18th annual Library

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.230
of Congress National
Book Festival.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.750
I'm Jon Parrish Peede,
I'm the chairman

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.400
of the National Endowment
for the Humanities.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.910
And NEH is proud to sponsor
this year's Understanding Our

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.350
World stage.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:23.650
An independent federal agency,
NEH was established in 1965

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.560
under LBJ as part of the
great society legislation.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.450
And we're rooted with our sister
agency NEA, still in that cause.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.280
Our agency supports museum
exhibitions, documentaries,

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.960
books that bring history,
literature, philosophy,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.000
archaeology, and the other
humanities fields to the public.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.470
We fund the preservation

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.640
of historic records,
collections, objects.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.640
We sponsor the educational
opportunities for K12 teachers

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.420
across this nation and for
students in the humanities.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.120
And we underride fundamental
research across the disciplines

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.620
of the humanities
at universities

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.630
and for independent
scholars across this nation.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.550
And so it is my absolute
pleasure to be here

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.060
to introduce this panel,
Monumental Decisions,

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.060
which will be led by four
scholars for thinkers

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.610
and writers and their
book signings will be

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.690
on the lower level shortly
after this program at 11.30.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.600
In terms of NEH, we have always
taken an interest in memorials.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.560
I can say, for example,
in 1979, the same year

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.000
that the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial Fund was created,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.060
NEH issued a grant for
a national symposium

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.810
on issues raised by the memorial
and plans for an archive

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.800
of the soldiers'
experiences in Southeast Asia.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.080
Our four guests have devoted
so much time and research

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.510
and wisdom to contemplating
the complexity

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.450
of who gets remembered
in wars and why.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.150
And how the narrative of war
changes in response over time.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.320
So our panelists include
professor Kristin Hass,

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.950
James Reston Jr,
Professor Kirk Savage,

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.500
and our moderator
is Brent D. Glass.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.580
Of course, many of us
in Washington know him

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.940
as director emeritus

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.940
of the Smithsonian's National
Museum of American History.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.330
He's a public scholar.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.040
He particularly advanced the
area of oral scholarship,

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.200
oral histories, and
oral narratives.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.200
He's a national leader
in the preservation

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.120
and interpretation of history.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.980
Glass also served as
a member for a decade

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.610
of the Flight 93 Memorial
Advisory Commission.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.090
He is the author of "50
Great American Places,

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.910
Essential Historic
Sites Across the US."

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.270
Brent will introduce our
panelists, so please join me

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.510
in giving them a warm welcome.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.070
[ Applause ]

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.330
&gt;&gt; Brent D. Glass: Thank
you, Chairman Peede.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.090
And welcome everyone.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.870
It's a delight for me
to share this panel.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.440
And I do want to recognize
the National Endowment

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.040
for the Humanities and the
outstanding support they give

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.310
to scholarship in the
humanities for many, many years.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.540
And all of us on this panel I
believe have benefited and many

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.080
of us in the audience
have benefited

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.430
for the support from NEH.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.900
So it's a real honor to chair
this panel sponsored by NEH.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:41.320
We, the subject of statues
and monuments and memorials

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.170
of course is not a new issue.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.150
But I think not since the time
of Licinius, in the 4th century,

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.810
Licinius tore down some statues
of the emperor Constantine

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.560
and triggered a civil war, not
since that time has there been

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.360
so much contention
and discussion

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.370
about statues and memorials.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.180
And our panelists today are very
well prepared to talk about it.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.330
But with such a good audience
and an engaged audience,

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.010
we've left time at the
end of this session

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.310
for you to participate.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.950
So it's very important that
we have your reaction to some

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.590
of the issues that will be
raised here this morning.

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.210
So Kristin Hass is the associate
professor in the department

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.260
of American culture and director
of the Humanities Collaboratory

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.600
at the University of Michigan.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.250
She has written two books,
"Sacrificing Soldiers

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.500
on the National Mall; A Study of
Militarism, Race, War Memorials,

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.170
and US Nationalism," and
the other book is "Carried

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.950
to the Wall; American Memory and
the Vietnam Veterans Memorial;

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.350
an Exploration of Playback
Memorial Practices,

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.290
Material Culture Studies,

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.440
and the Legacies of
the Vietnam War."

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.720
Kirk Savage is the Dietrich
professor of History, Art,

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.980
and Architecture at the
University of Pittsburgh.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.820
He is the editor of "The
Civil War in Art and Memory,"

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.340
the author of two books,
"Standing Soldiers,

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.840
Kneeling Slaves; Race,
War, and Monument

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.430
in 19th Century America,"
which is just

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.740
out from Princeton University
Press in its second edition,

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.130
and also "Monument
Wars; Washington DC,

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.360
the National Mall,
and the Transformation

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.950
of the Memorial Landscape."

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:38.400
James Reston Jr is the author
of 18 books, including "Warriors

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.200
of God" and "The
Conviction of Richard Nixon,"

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.240
which inspired the play
turned film "Frost/Nixon."

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.440
He has also written three
plays, numerous articles

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.810
in national magazines, and
an award winning documentary

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.710
about the 1978 Jonestown
massacre.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.450
His last five historical
works have been translated

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.960
into 13 languages.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.490
"Warriors of God" is an
international bestseller

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:08.370
with over 200,000 copies
sold and still selling.

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.680
Which I think is
always good news.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.370
"Fragile Innocence,"
another one of his books,

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.700
is a memoir of bringing up
his handicapped daughter.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.170
And it reached number eight

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.520
on the Washington
Post bestseller list.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.900
His new book is "A Rift
in the Earth; Art, Memory,

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.300
and the Fight for a
Vietnam War Memorial."

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.510
So please welcome our panel.

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:38.180
[ Applause ]

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.200
And what we're going to
do is this is divided

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.680
into really four parts.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.920
First, I've asked our
panel to talk a little bit

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.530
about the intellectual path that
led them to write their books

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.080
on monuments and memorials.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:55.270
Second, we will talk about their
thoughts concerning memorials

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:59.850
on the National Mall, especially
those that have been inspired

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:03.630
by the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial, but memorials

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:05.930
that have appeared
around the country

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:11.110
since the Veterans War
Memorial has been dedicated.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.580
And then the third part of
our panel will be to talk

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.220
about making monuments and
what we should be thinking

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:18.710
about about the monuments

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:22.340
that were dedicated
more than 100 years ago.

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.610
As a result of the
commemoration of the Civil War.

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:27.280
And finally will be your turn

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.310
to ask us questions
or make comments.

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:34.070
So just leading off, I will
just mention briefly why I came

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:36.400
to write "50 Great
American Places."

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.530
And David McCullough, who wrote
the forward to the book said

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.990
to me "Write the book that
you would want to read."

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:45.160
And the book I wanted
to read had three goals.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.830
One was to inspire
history education.

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:51.380
Second was to encourage
people to go out

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:53.870
and visit historic places.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:57.560
And the third goal was to
encourage the preservation

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.120
of our historic sites.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.790
Now several other sites that
I write about are also related

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:05.650
to the memorial landscape
of America.

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:09.820
There's the USS Arizona
and Pearl Harbor,

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:13.790
the Salem Witch Trial memorial
in Salem, Massachusetts,

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:17.650
of course the National Mall,
the Memorial at Wounded Knee,

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:20.650
South Dakota, and also
the Statue of Liberty.

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:23.770
And I may have a few comments to
make about the Statue of Liberty

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.170
because it's a great
illustration

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:28.940
of how some memorials wind up
in the public consciousness

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.720
in a very different
way, have us thinking

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.170
in a very different
way, than how,

00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:36.690
what they were originally
conceived to be.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:42.750
But I want to stop and let our
panel discuss the intellectual

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:47.790
biography of the books, how they
came to write what they wrote

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:49.570
about memorials and monuments.

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:52.140
And Kristin Hass, would
you please lead off.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.150
&gt;&gt; Kristin Ann Hass:
I'd be happy to.

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:57.210
Good morning.

00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:04.320
I started with an
interest in patriotism

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:11.030
in how patriotism works, in
where that you hear the anthem

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:14.100
and you get a hit of emotion.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:20.440
I was really interested in how
that came to be, who made it.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:26.810
I was a hippie kid from northern
California and understood myself

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:29.770
to be intensely patriotic.

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:34.700
And I was, as a young girl,
fascinated by the First Ladies,

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:38.370
which for my demographic
was fairly unusual.

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.370
And I wasn't interested in
the First Ladies' dresses,

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:45.460
I was interested in for women
who couldn't have access

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:50.770
to the highest office, what it
was like to stand next to that.

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:54.560
I was interested in emotional,

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:59.240
the emotional power
of patriotism.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:04.530
And that led me to an
interest in public history.

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:06.720
Who gets to make public history?

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:10.500
What are the stories we tell
each other and ourselves

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:14.330
about who we are and
how we came to be?

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:18.900
And that interest in public
history led me after I graduated

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.410
from college to an
unpaid internship

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:24.140
at the National Museum
of American History.

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:27.070
And my first job there
was to work on an exhibit

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:30.050
on everyday life in
the 20th century.

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:34.320
What are the objects that would
tell the story of American life

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:38.080
in the 20th century to the
millions of middle schoolers

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:41.590
who move through that building?

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:46.460
The dress that Elizabeth
Eckford wore

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:50.310
on that famous day
in Little Rock.

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:54.260
I was, so I was spending all
my time thinking about kind

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.400
of what are the objects
that tell our story?

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.960
Because it was an unpaid
internship, I was a nanny.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:02.060
And I had an hour
to myself every day.

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:05.070
So I was running around the Mall
and running around the Mall.

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:11.170
I went by the Vietnam Memorial,
first time noticing the objects,

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:18.090
the boots, the flags, the
flowers, the unexpected toys,

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:21.830
second time thinking
"What is this?"

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:24.810
Third time stopping in
my tracks and saying

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:30.770
"This is an incredible
expression of patriotism,"

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:36.300
but also a making of public
history that was unsolicited,

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.400
that was, at that time,
now there's a tragedy

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.240
and everybody brings their
stuff, that did not happen

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.080
in the United States,
it's ubiquitous now,

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.930
it didn't happen before the
Vietnam Veterans Memorial.

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:51.810
So I brought my interests
in the emotion of patriotism

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:54.180
and the mechanics of patriotism

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:58.290
and how public history
more broadly is made

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:00.360
to a study of those objects.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.000
And that's the produced
my description,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.090
and then my first book
"Carried to the Wall."

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:08.280
And I wrote about
why that mattered.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.030
And the second book
is a follow-up.

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:13.760
I was interested in
the objects still,

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:17.810
but I was really interested
in how the Vietnam Memorial,

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:20.020
the objects, the place itself,

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:24.200
transformed memorial
practices going forward.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.580
&gt;&gt; Brent D. Glass: Thank you.

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.230
Jim Reston.

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:30.080
"Rift in the Land."

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.490
&gt;&gt; James Reston Jr: So
I'm a veteran that was

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:36.500
in the Army from 1965 to 1968.

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:42.060
Fortunately only by
happenstance, not in Vietnam.

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:46.610
And afterwards, I became very
involved in the Amnesty Movement

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:51.420
for the return of war
resistors to the United States

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.700
who had gone into exile.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.820
And the first, the service

00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:00.920
in the Army gave me a
very deep understanding

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:04.310
and sympathy for the soldier.

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:08.120
Especially the soldier
who is at risk.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:13.580
And the experience with amnesty
gave me a very deep interest

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:16.520
in the whole question
of reconciliation.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:20.690
But particularly reconciliation
after a divisive war.

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:23.260
Of course, I was
focused with amnesty

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:28.250
on reconciliation after Vietnam.

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:33.790
But the historical parallel
of the post-Civil War period

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:36.790
with its amnesties
were southern soldiers

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:39.670
and southern leaders,
was a real parallel.

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:42.550
And the real argument
for a universal amnesty

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:46.330
for Vietnam war resistors.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:50.340
So in a way with this current
book, I was returning to some

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:53.300
of those old emotional roots.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:58.310
I always think that beyond
intellectual interest

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:00.860
in a subject, it's
a very good thing

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:03.680
to have an emotional
connection to it.

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:08.290
And in this case, there
were two emotional roots.

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:13.150
One was that I was a good
friend of Frederick Hart,

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:16.970
who is the sculptor
of the three soldiers

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:20.190
at the Vietnam Memorial.

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:25.780
The sculptures probably
saved the building

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:29.490
of a Vietnam Memorial
at all, as controversial

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:31.340
as they are artistically.

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:36.920
So I was very interested in
my interchanges with Rick Hart

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.640
about the battle over
the Vietnam Memorial.

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:45.180
The second is that I
have one colleague,

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:48.440
fellow GI, who's on the wall.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:56.000
Who was killed in Hue,
Vietnam, January 30th, 1968.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.110
As the north Vietnamese came
in invading the city of Hue.

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:08.880
And so in a way, I personally
experienced the very heart

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:15.010
and the very essence of the
Vietnam Wall of Maya Lin

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:19.040
that the survivors of
Vietnam look at their friends

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:25.860
who are lost and see their own
image reflected in that wall.

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:29.390
It was the third
impulse, not so noble,

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:34.840
that my daughter may have
finished her master's degree

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.580
at Dartmouth in Vietnam studies.

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:44.260
And I went to her graduation
ceremony and we had a chance

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.300
to talk to her advisor,
who was an advisor

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:50.330
to Ken Burns' Vietnam,

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:54.850
magnificent Vietnam
documentary series.

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:57.880
And this was some time ago.

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:03.780
And I asked this scholar when
is the Ken Burns thing going

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:05.080
to happen?

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:08.010
And he said "oh, not
for two years from now."

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:10.260
So I thought two years,

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:15.290
that's about the time it
takes to write a book?

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:21.240
And "A Rift in the Earth" was
published the day before Ken

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:25.870
Burns' documentary came
to national television.

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:27.170
&gt;&gt; Kristin Ann Hass:
Well done, well done.

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:28.470
&gt;&gt; Brent D. Glass: Very
good timing, thank you.

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:29.770
Kirk Savage.

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:32.600
Talk a little bit about
the background that led you

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.760
to write what you're
writing, but then lead us

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.820
into the next question.

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:40.730
Which is thinking about
memorials and monuments,

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:42.730
especially here in Washington,

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:45.170
since the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial.

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:49.510
But other examples if you
choose to, since that's high.

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:52.940
&gt;&gt; Kirk Savage: Okay so
I'm kind of a scholar,

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:54.730
a one-note scholar,
I've been writing

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:58.800
about public monuments
for over 30 years.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.780
I got interested in them

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:04.700
as a college student
in Westminster Abby.

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:07.160
I was fortunate to
study in London.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:11.360
And seeing these incredible
sort of public tomb monuments

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:14.370
to these figures and trying to
understand why they were erected

00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:15.670
and what they were doing.

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:19.720
So I really came in through
the art history side of things.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:23.810
But when the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial was being erected,

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:28.210
I just became fascinated with
the controversy surrounding it.

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:31.810
You know, I too grew up
in the Vietnam War Era.

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:35.390
So I had a lot of ties with,
my parents were involved

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:37.350
with the anti-war movement.

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:42.630
But the controversy itself
was what really engaged me.

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:47.390
How was it that formal design
questions could suddenly become

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:50.250
so emotionally significant?

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:53.050
So politically significant
to people?

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:56.330
And really trying to understand
the how and why of that.

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:59.110
So it was kind of the perfect
marriage of art and politics,

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:03.240
which were really my two,
my two key interests.

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:05.950
And so that's how I got into
actually starting to write

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:07.250
about public monuments.

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:11.020
And then from there, I realized
the Washington monument,

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:15.530
in the 19th century, was kind of
the mother of all controversies.

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:17.260
And I began writing on that

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:22.960
and that propelled my
interest in the National Mall.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:27.540
Subsequent to that, I got the
idea of writing a dissertation

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:29.830
on Civil War memorials,
which people

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:33.390
in art history thought was
an absolutely ridiculous idea

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:36.280
because you know, they were
artistically insignificant

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:37.580
and so on, so forth.

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:40.820
That, for me again, it
was all about why were

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:45.880
so many monuments erected,
and you know, from both sides

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:48.240
in the war and what was their
function, their purpose,

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:51.780
and why were people so invested
in them became the questions

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:53.710
that I got interested in.

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:58.720
It was only through that process
of doing my research that more

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.630
and more and more I
became really, became more

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:05.980
and more aware of the importance
of the story of slavery

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:11.120
and emancipation in the
erection of Civil War memorials.

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:14.660
And so that's really what
my first book became about.

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:19.520
Was really how was the story of
slavery and emancipation told

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:24.160
in the memorial landscape
after the Civil War.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:30.160
And I, you know, I have
ancestors on both sides

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:33.450
of the war, but my father's
family was from Alabama.

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:35.180
And with deep roots there.

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:38.730
And so that also partly drove
my interests, particularly

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:42.740
in the Confederate monuments and
trying to grapple, really reckon

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:46.720
in a serious way, with the
history of what I came to see

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.110
as a history of white supremacy

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:50.920
that lay behind the
Confederate memorials.

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.740
So you wanted me
to segue into-- .

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:55.040
&gt;&gt; Brent D. Glass: Yes,

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.580
I'm going to just check our
time and we're doing well.

00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:59.610
I just thought it
would be useful

00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:02.680
from your perspective
here to talk a little bit

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:08.840
about monument making in
the last 40 years and how

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:12.330
that has been influenced
by legislation,

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:15.480
how it's been influenced
by just the experience

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:19.300
of the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial.

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:23.620
And then from Kristin and
Jim to also comment on that.

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:26.170
We want to have sort
of a conversation.

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:28.140
But I do want to
reserve some time to talk

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:32.260
about what's been even in
this morning's New York Times,

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:36.560
another article about
the statue at University

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.340
of North Carolina Chapel Hill

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:42.390
and then also allow our
audience to participate.

00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:43.870
So please.

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:45.170
&gt;&gt; Kirk Savage: Right.

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:47.330
So you know, the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial really was a

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:49.170
game-changer, you
know, in the history

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:51.510
of monuments in the
United States.

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:54.730
And you know, my other panelists
can talk more about this.

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:57.260
But the, really the
public monument

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:59.780
as a form was more
abundant at the time

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:03.330
that that memorial was erected.

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:06.730
And the incredible
outpouring of response to it,

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:10.220
it's kind of immediate,
visceral success that it had,

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:15.440
really changed the
way everybody thought

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.780
about public monuments
at that time.

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:20.830
It certainly drew in tons
of scholarly attention.

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:23.280
But also tons of
popular attention to it.

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:26.640
And now all of a sudden, local
communities and other groups,

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:31.460
veterans groups, wanted to
build monuments as well.

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:36.230
And many of them following in
some way or another some formula

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:39.080
that was pioneered by Maya Lin

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:41.770
in the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial.

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:45.430
And so that's what then really
has led to the transformation

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:47.790
of the Mall in the late 20th
century with the addition

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:51.430
of the Korean War Memorial
and the World War II Memorial

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:54.390
and now we have several
memorials authorized

00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:58.210
to even more recent
wars, the global war

00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:00.250
on terror, for example.

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:05.170
And just to put this in context,
there really was legislation,

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:07.960
you know, after the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial was erected.

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:11.510
And kind of monuments
were now revived.

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:15.160
The congress began to
worry about the fact

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:18.000
that there was a limited space
in the city, particularly

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.160
in the Mall area,
for new monuments.

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:22.800
And so they adopted the
commemorative work sac,

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.100
which was supposed
to put the brakes

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:26.930
on new memorial construction.

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:30.150
And created certain
rules like a memorial

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:34.170
to a person could only
be erected 25 years

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:35.720
after that person's death.

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:39.150
A memorial to a war could
only be erected 10 years

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:42.300
after the declared
end of that war.

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:47.050
And that legislation of course
has been honored in the breach

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:49.580
because many new
proposals have come forward

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:52.550
which have gotten exemptions
from that legislation,

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:55.770
like the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial education center.

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:59.710
And now most recently the global
war on terror, which is a war

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:01.600
that is not only not over yet

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:06.250
but it's arguably never
going to be over in theory.

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:10.790
So we have a situation now that
is really very, very different

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:13.400
from where we started with
the Vietnam Veterans Memorial

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.620
in '82.

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:16.920
&gt;&gt; Brent D. Glass: Kristin?

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.220
&gt;&gt; Kristin Ann Hass:
I would add to that

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:19.520
that in the United States,

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.630
there have been two
big memorial booms,

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:26.700
two periods in which there was
intense interest in memory,

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:29.350
more broadly public
memory, more broadly,

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:31.460
and memorials in particular.

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:34.800
And the first, it's kind
of important to understand,

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:40.010
was in the period
from 1890 to 1920.

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:44.430
And the memorials that were
built in that period were built,

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:46.200
they were Civil War memorials.

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:49.800
But they came significantly
after the war.

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:52.690
And many of them were built
by women's organizations

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:55.960
on both sides, United
Daughters of the Confederacy,

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:57.750
Daughters of the
American Revolution,

00:23:57.750 --> 00:24:00.460
all kinds of local
women's organizations

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:05.410
and national women's
organizations really dedicated

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:10.550
to producing a very particular
memory of the Civil War.

00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:14.260
And after the first World
War and the second World War,

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:19.860
there was very little interest
in monumentality in stone

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:23.480
that would make a particular
meaning of those wars.

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:28.440
Those wars were remembered by
small, local lists of names

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:31.930
in a town square, but
also really importantly,

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:34.580
by infrastructure.

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:37.960
Especially after the second
World War, World War II veterans

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.080
in their American
Legion meetings

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.920
and their local newspapers
were very explicit

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:45.880
that they wanted infrastructure.

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:48.330
My daughter, who's in the
second row, went through much

00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:50.910
of her life wearing a
t-shirt that said "Vets."

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:53.900
Because she swam for the
Veterans Memorial swim team.

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:55.630
Didn't really occur
to her necessarily

00:24:55.630 --> 00:25:00.160
that she was honoring the
service, the incredible service,

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.380
of Americans during the
second World War, but in fact,

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:03.680
that's what they wanted.

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.340
They wanted kids to have
pools and basketball courts

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:11.100
and it was Jan Scruggs and Maya
Lin's Vietnam Veterans Memorial

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:12.500
that changed that.

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:15.320
That made memorials
mattered again

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.960
and that inspired
this incredible,

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:21.330
short-term transformation
of the National Mall.

00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:26.460
And I spent a lot of time kind
of deep diving into the minutes

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:28.260
of the meetings where
people argued

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:30.680
about the Korean War
Veterans Memorial,

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:33.580
the World War II
Memorial, the unbuilt

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:38.510
but completely fascinating
Black Revolutionary War

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:40.410
Patriots Memorial.

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:44.950
The Women's Memorial, women
in military service memorial,

00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:48.180
which fascinating, was kind
of paid for by the Saudis

00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:50.720
and the Kuwaitis, which
is super interesting.

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:55.720
And the National
Japanese American Memorial

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.610
to patriotism during
World War II.

00:25:57.610 --> 00:26:02.070
So these memorials, built
in this period, entirely

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:05.850
and explicitly both
inspired by the wall

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:07.610
and in response to the wall.

00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:12.940
And in the case of two big
and most successful memorials,

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:14.620
the Second World War memorial

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:18.270
and the Korean War Veterans
Memorial, corrective.

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:20.920
Explicitly corrective.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:25.870
We are going to fix what's
wrong with the Vietnam Memorial,

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:27.830
what's wrong with the
Vietnam Memorial in the view

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:30.820
of the people who wanted to
build these other memorials was

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:33.300
that these same eighth
graders who were going

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:36.430
through the National Museum of
American History were coming

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:40.690
to the Mall to this important
side of national pilgrimage,

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:45.950
and learning that dying in an
American War could be tragic.

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:48.160
And wasn't necessarily heroic.

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:54.270
And in an era of
all-volunteer military, tricky.

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:57.450
And so those memorials
were built in response.

00:26:57.450 --> 00:27:00.360
&gt;&gt; Brent D. Glass: Jim, I
want to ask you to comment

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:05.590
on what we've heard so far about
the National Mall and the impact

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:07.580
of the Vietnam War Memorial.

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:11.450
But I'm also going to
challenge you to then take us

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:15.510
into a conversation about
the Confederate memorial,

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:18.990
the statues and, because I
know you care deeply about that

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:23.110
as well as a graduate of UNC.

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:26.940
And someone who's thought
about this quite a bit.

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:28.880
So please take-- .

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.890
&gt;&gt; James Reston Jr: So if
you have a look at "A Rift

00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:36.560
in the Earth," you'll see that
I have a color section in there

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:41.200
of the [inaudible] of other
concepts by other artists

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:44.300
for a Vietnam memorial.

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:49.290
And you see in those [inaudible]
the struggle that artists went

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:53.240
through to try to conceptualize
what would be appropriate

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:55.820
for a lost war.

00:27:55.820 --> 00:28:01.770
And nobody can look at
those other examples

00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:06.050
without thinking
how lucky we were

00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:11.040
that Maya Lin had her
concept for this thing.

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:16.100
One of the things that
interests me immensely

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:21.050
about the Vietnam Memorial
today is the evolution

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:23.760
of it since it was built.

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:29.740
In my view, it is no
longer a veterans memorial.

00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:31.480
It's become globalized.

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:34.010
It's become internationalized.

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:36.440
As a memorial for everyone.

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:40.510
At the beginning, it was
as if the veterans had,

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:43.440
it was their proprietary
memorial.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.700
And it was just for them.

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:50.540
But as time has gone
on, it's changed

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:53.750
and it's become important
to everybody.

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:57.780
It's also in a way no
longer about Vietnam.

00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:04.600
It's become internationalized
and made universal.

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:08.790
Universalized I should
say, as a comment,

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:11.780
a commentary on all wars.

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:17.430
The Vietnam memorial is
about the cost of war.

00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:19.720
And that's universal.

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:21.440
That's a universal theme.

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:27.820
And it's one that will make
that memorial live forever.

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:32.230
It's also, as they've
said, been a game-changer

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:34.710
for belonged of all
war memorials.

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:37.810
For example, when
I went to Vietnam,

00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:45.300
there is a memorial north of
the DMZ which is a memorial

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:49.530
for the dead of the north
Vietnamese in Vietnam.

00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:52.900
And how do they memorialize
that?

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:59.700
By black granite slabs with the
names of the dead in Vietnamese.

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:03.550
So that's an example
of how, what the impact

00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:09.490
of this artistic concept
of remembering war not

00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:12.840
for its glory and its
service necessarily,

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:20.350
but simply for the cost and
the carnage of warfare itself.

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:24.470
The whole thing about
the evolution

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:31.100
of Civil War memorials is also
a theme here it seems to me.

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:35.040
That when I was a
student at Chapel Hill

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:37.280
and a professor there
for 10 years,

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:42.480
the Silent Sam statue
was a joke figure.

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:47.550
It was this sort of
generic, interesting statue

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:49.800
with a soldier holding a gun.

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:54.280
And he was Silent Sam because
he shot his gun off whenever a

00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:58.730
virgin walked by.

00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:04.220
That joke is actually not
unique to Chapel Hill.

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:06.570
My daughter, for
example, went to Cornell,

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:12.790
and on the Cornell campus, there
are statues of the two founders

00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:15.910
that face one another
and there are footsteps

00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:17.580
in between the two statues.

00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:21.330
And the notion is that
whenever a virgin walked by,

00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:24.740
the two statues,
statuary figures got up

00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:28.130
and met one another in the
middle and shook hands.

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:33.100
So Silent Sam was
a totally benign,

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:37.510
uninteresting, forgotten piece.

00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:43.270
And suddenly by honestly
some very fine scholarship,

00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:50.160
this 1913 dedication of
the statue was discovered

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:58.050
in all its horror and scurrilous
white supremacist rhetoric.

00:31:58.050 --> 00:32:07.040
And so suddenly, Silent Sam
takes life as a very vibrant,

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:13.690
passionate and scurrilous
symbol of white racism.

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:19.450
And what do we do about
this sort of thing?

00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:22.790
I've heard it said what needs
to happen in the South is

00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:28.470
that there be a movement in
which all of the South is swept.

00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:33.510
Every small town that
has a Confederate soldier

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:38.760
on a pedestal needs to be
swept and these statues taken

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:41.920
down in one way or another.

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.940
I'm very concerned
with the way in which

00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:51.690
that Silent Sam statue was
torn down and destroyed.

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:56.760
It concerns me as a historian
about what is the impact

00:32:56.760 --> 00:33:00.440
of that kind of action
and where does it lead?

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:03.830
Is this basically leading
us towards a concept

00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:10.130
of the Civil War of glory on the
northern side and humiliation

00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:14.180
and shame on the confederate
side and therefore any symbol

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:17.950
of the Southern Confederacy
is shameful?

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:23.180
This leads to book burnings.

00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:30.080
And I'm, and a, from the
sanitizing, white-washing

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:35.450
of history, it leads to, in
my view, a very one-sided,

00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:39.140
one-minded way of
looking at history.

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:42.020
&gt;&gt; Brent D. Glass: Kirk,
you want to add anything?

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:45.780
You've written, and I was
interested in your book,

00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:49.210
which has a long section
on monument avenue

00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:52.200
and the Lee Memorial
in Richmond.

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:57.170
And I recommend to the
audience to look at the mayor

00:33:57.170 --> 00:34:00.830
of Richmond commissioned
a very thoughtful process

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:05.530
to evaluate what to do with
monument avenue and it's online

00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:08.900
on the City of Richmond's
website.

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:11.040
But I'd like you,
I'm sure you've read

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.430
that and looked at-- .

00:34:12.430 --> 00:34:13.730
&gt;&gt; Kirk Savage: Yeah.

00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:15.030
&gt;&gt; Brent D. Glass: And
offer your observations

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:16.330
in light of what Jim has said.

00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:17.630
&gt;&gt; Kirk Savage.

00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:19.300
Sure, well this is
a very vexed issue.

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:20.880
I think Jim and I have maybe,

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:23.230
are maybe on somewhat
different ends

00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:25.220
of the spectrum on
this question.

00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:28.510
As an art historian,
of course I'm inclined

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:29.990
for its preservation.

00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:33.650
If stuff isn't preserved,
we can't study it.

00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:36.990
So that's a basic
kind of bottom line.

00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:41.560
The problem is these monuments
that are out in public space

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:43.320
that are honored,
they're honored by virtue

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:46.470
of where they are, they were
put up for particular reasons

00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:50.410
to actually advance
certain agendas.

00:34:50.410 --> 00:34:52.340
And how do we reckon with that

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:55.810
and how do we contest those
agendas now in the present?

00:34:55.810 --> 00:34:57.110
What's the right thing to do?

00:34:57.110 --> 00:35:01.540
There really aren't a lot
of easy answers to that.

00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:06.570
My view is that the monuments
themselves sanitize history.

00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:08.780
They tell a particular
version of history.

00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:12.280
They were motivated
by white supremacy.

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:16.710
And they were meant to
actually celebrate the triumph

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:19.260
of white supremacy in the South.

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:23.000
And that is a very
difficult pill to swallow now.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.080
So I mean I can just
tell you from my own,

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:26.870
my personal experience
in Pittsburgh,

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:30.510
we had a monument
erected to Stephen Foster,

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:34.980
which featured a black,
a barefoot, black,

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:39.690
toothless black banjo
player sitting at his feet.

00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:44.080
And for a long time, it was also
kind of like Silent Sam, a joke,

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:47.650
at least within the sort of
white professoriate, like me,

00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:49.110
it was kind of a joke.

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:53.580
But once Charlottesville
happened and those people

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:54.880
in the public sphere,

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.550
particularly the African
American community,

00:35:56.550 --> 00:36:01.440
felt more empowered to actually
speak up about this statue,

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:06.050
we you know, saw how long
they had been living painfully

00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:07.350
with this monument.

00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:10.720
For so many years and had
their voices, in fact,

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:12.360
they had protested it
at different times,

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:15.080
but their voices had been
for the most part ignored.

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:18.430
Has to be remembered that public
space is not a level playing

00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:21.730
field where everybody
has free speech.

00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:25.650
So public monuments
were erected by people

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:28.230
who had the power to erect them.

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:30.190
And that power continues.

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:34.000
And so that is the problem
that we, I think, face today.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.900
And it has changed my thinking.

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:38.430
I mean I see a whole range

00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:41.690
of solutions possible
for monuments.

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:43.750
But none of them are easy.

00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:45.750
And none of them are cost-free.

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:49.380
And I do see removal
is one option.

00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:50.680
That's in fact what happened

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:53.800
to my Stephen Foster
statue, is it's gone now.

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.100
&gt;&gt; Brent D. Glass: Right.

00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:57.700
Well I think it's
interesting, and I want Kristin

00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:00.870
to offer a comment
on this as well.

00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:03.240
But in addition to
reading the report

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.880
of the monument avenue
commission in Richmond,

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:09.820
I recommend to you that you read
Mitchell Andrew's book recently

00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:13.200
came out about his decision
and the decision in New Orleans

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:16.080
to remove the confederate
statues.

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:19.720
So you have one mayor, a
white mayor in New Orleans,

00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:22.700
removing the symbols
of white supremacy.

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:24.650
You have an African
American mayor

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:27.900
in Richmond endorsing
a preservation

00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:30.460
of Civil War monuments.

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:32.990
So we've got very
interesting conversation going

00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:34.960
on here in those two cities.

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:38.950
And I will add to that
where I went to school

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:41.010
and where Jim Reston went
to school at Chapel Hill

00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:43.110
in North Carolina, Kristin,
and then we're going

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:45.080
to let the audience
have a chance.

00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:46.380
&gt;&gt; Kristin Ann Hass: I
would just add quickly

00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:47.680
that it's important to remember

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:50.330
that memorials are
fairly blunt instruments.

00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:53.120
And they are used as such.

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:55.990
And that we don't need
to hold onto memorials

00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:57.860
as the keepers of our history.

00:37:57.860 --> 00:38:02.460
That's why historians
spend years and hours

00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:04.170
in the archives, right?

00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:06.900
There are more subtle
and more complicated ways

00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:08.810
to tell history.

00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:12.460
And the reason that people want
these memorials to come down is

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:16.360
because they are successfully
doing the work that the people

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:19.650
that erected them wanted done.

00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:23.450
And so they're working
and that's a problem.

00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:27.400
Because of the reasons they
wanted them to be built.

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:30.490
&gt;&gt; Brent D. Glass: I'd like to
invite members of the audience

00:38:30.490 --> 00:38:33.280
to participate for the
remaining time we have.

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:35.710
As you come to the
microphone, I would just

00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:37.990
like to offer my comment on one

00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:40.600
of the first Civil
War Memorials,

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:43.170
which is the Statue of Liberty.

00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:45.910
Now most people, and this
is what's fascinating to me

00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:49.080
about how memorials
change in their concept,

00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:53.840
the French when they wanted
to gift the Statue of Liberty

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:56.900
to the US, it was to
celebrate the preservation

00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:58.210
of the republic.

00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:01.680
The preservation of democracy
and the abolition of slavery.

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:04.700
And if you look carefully at
the statue of liberty and look

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:08.570
at her ankles, there's a
broken chain on her ankle.

00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:11.690
That was a symbol of the
abolition of slavery.

00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:16.950
However, from the late 1860's
when the statue was conceived,

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:21.890
to 1886 when it was finally
dedicated, America had changed,

00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:26.720
immigration had become a
much more important issue,

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:29.400
and the Statue of
Liberty became associated

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:32.480
with welcoming immigrants
to America.

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:36.570
Emma Lazarus's poem, which was
written as part of a fundraiser

00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:40.140
for the pedestal of the statue,
wasn't placed on the statue

00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:44.000
until the early 20th century
but it was a well-known poem

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.290
and really transformed the
statue from a preserving our,

00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:50.870
the preservation of
American democracy

00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:56.190
to welcoming immigrants to
the country and a symbol

00:39:56.190 --> 00:39:58.840
of immigrant, the
value of contribution

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:00.340
of immigrants to our country.

00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:03.360
Now, audience, please.

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:04.880
&gt;&gt; Thank you, and thank
you to the panelists.

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:07.030
I'd like to direct this
question to Mr. Reston based

00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:09.430
on your experiences
with Secretary Udall.

00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:13.230
We're talking about monuments
today in the form of structures.

00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:15.750
I'd like to ask about
national monuments.

00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:17.050
The landscape.

00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:19.610
In particular, in the
Clinton administration,

00:40:19.610 --> 00:40:22.500
President Clinton designated
the Grand Staircase Escalante

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:24.250
National Monument in Utah

00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:27.060
and President Obama designated
The Bears Ears National Monument

00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:28.360
in Utah.

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:31.130
The first one to be co-managed
by Native American peoples

00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:32.460
and the US Government.

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:34.680
And the current administration
has shrunken the size

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:35.980
of both of those monuments.

00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:38.660
And I wonder, my question
is, what does that say

00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:40.440
about changing values
in America?

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:43.850
And what is the larger
statement about tearing

00:40:43.850 --> 00:40:47.130
down these structures say
about our values as a country?

00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:48.660
&gt;&gt; Brent D. Glass: Thank you.

00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:52.290
Jim, you want to tackle that?

00:40:52.290 --> 00:40:54.160
&gt;&gt; James Reston Jr: Well,
we had a telephone call.

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:57.310
The three of us, the four
of us, about this thing.

00:40:57.310 --> 00:41:04.570
And the concept arose
called presentism.

00:41:04.570 --> 00:41:08.420
And the definition of
presentism is the application

00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:13.480
of values today on past events.

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:19.000
It's a very I think
useful concept for analysis

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.830
of the Civil War memorial theme.

00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:23.790
Because it raises the question

00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:28.310
of how are our values today
playing into how we look

00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:31.930
at memorials that were
established long ago?

00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:39.240
And in the case of Silent
Sam at UNC, is it really fair

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:48.840
to impose our values
today on a generic statue

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:53.760
of a Civil War soldier?

00:41:55.260 --> 00:42:06.560
You know, that memorial
was so benign for so long,

00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:10.430
without any of this thing.

00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:17.410
So suddenly we are meant to
feel what people felt in 1913

00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:19.750
in relation to our values.

00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:21.180
It should be remembered

00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:27.350
that 483,000 Southern
men were casualties

00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:29.760
of the American Civil War.

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:34.710
And so is at least
a part of the way

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:38.410
in which these statues
were erected.

00:42:38.410 --> 00:42:41.410
And this is where Kirk and
I would have our debate.

00:42:41.410 --> 00:42:46.050
That those statues were
partly erected for the grief

00:42:46.050 --> 00:42:49.430
of the loss of Southern boys.

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:54.750
And perhaps secondarily for
the whole process of invasion.

00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:57.920
Not necessarily for the
protection of slavery.

00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:02.790
But the invasion of
the South by the North.

00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:06.670
So I think it's not a
complete explanation

00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:12.050
to just cast upon all of these
statues that were erected on,

00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:18.480
about the confederacy in
relation to our values today.

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:20.680
&gt;&gt; Brent D. Glass: So
we've got five minutes.

00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:22.120
We've got about eight questions.

00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:25.000
If somebody evicts us, I
will then have to leave.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.990
But let's make the
questions real quick

00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:31.060
and our panel will answer those.

00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:34.310
&gt;&gt; I'd like to ask the panel
to focus on Washington DC.

00:43:34.310 --> 00:43:38.390
Sometimes I worry that monuments
and memorials are like tattoos.

00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:41.240
That the first one is
glorious and meaningful

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:46.880
and the second one is also has
some importance to the subject.

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:49.400
And then eventually
you run out of space

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:52.960
and your arms are
covered with these things

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:56.690
without any coherence or plan.

00:43:56.690 --> 00:44:00.240
And driving on Independence
Avenue, I look over

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:03.450
and see what's going to be
the new Eisenhower Memorial,

00:44:03.450 --> 00:44:06.950
and I have no comment on the
artistic value, but it looks

00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:09.330
like it's going to
be very large.

00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:13.400
Aren't we eventually just
going to run out of space?

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:18.270
And if this countries endures
for another 100 or 200 years,

00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:21.150
there will be no more room
for a monument or a memorial.

00:44:21.150 --> 00:44:23.120
&gt;&gt; Brent D. Glass:
Kirk, do you want to?

00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:24.420
&gt;&gt; Kirk Savage: We will.

00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:26.050
The short answer is we
will run out of space.

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:29.130
Partly because monuments
are so much larger now.

00:44:29.130 --> 00:44:31.120
So we're talking in
terms of, in Washington,

00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:33.530
we're talking in terms of acres.

00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:35.950
I mean when I saw the, you know,

00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:37.370
the site for the
Eisenhower memorial,

00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:38.910
I was thinking why
couldn't we just go back

00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:41.490
to the old fashioned
guy on a pedestal?

00:44:41.490 --> 00:44:44.390
You know, that didn't
take up very much room.

00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:49.300
And the problem is that
these monuments live forever.

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:52.400
But they actually don't in
the public consciousness.

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:54.530
I mean they become
obsolete after a while.

00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:58.640
With some exceptions, like
the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.

00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:01.310
So Philip Kennikott, he's
from the Washington Post,

00:45:01.310 --> 00:45:04.410
suggested maybe we could
decommission war memorials

00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:07.190
after a certain period of
time, like 50 or 60 years.

00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:08.870
&gt;&gt; Brent D. Glass: We
could have a sunset-- .

00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:11.980
&gt;&gt; Kirk Savage: Sunset and put
them out in Arlington Cemetery

00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:15.350
with a wonderful ceremony,
and then clear the ground.

00:45:15.350 --> 00:45:16.760
&gt;&gt; Brent D. Glass: Okay,
let's have a couple-- .

00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:18.060
Oh, yes.

00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:19.360
&gt;&gt; Kristin Ann Hass: I just,
I think we need to hope

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:22.250
for war memorials to
go out of fashion.

00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:26.020
We need to come into a period
of greater ideological stability

00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:30.710
where we don't need them and
we'll stop building them.

00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:32.010
&gt;&gt; Brent D. Glass:
Well let's see

00:45:32.010 --> 00:45:33.310
if we can have a question
without a preamble.

00:45:33.310 --> 00:45:34.610
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:36.620
A short preamble.

00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:39.240
My father fought
in the Korean War.

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:43.580
And I'd like you to discuss how
the Korean War Memorial came

00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:45.720
to be, why it took so long.

00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:47.460
And you said that you'd
done some research

00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:49.450
in the archives as
to the process?

00:45:49.450 --> 00:45:53.120
Could you talk a
little bit about that?

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:54.420
&gt;&gt; Kristin Ann Hass: So briefly,

00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:56.250
it was very explicitly
a response

00:45:56.250 --> 00:45:58.540
to the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial,

00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:01.060
it was intended as a corrective.

00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:05.330
It was intended to
be heroic, masculine.

00:46:05.330 --> 00:46:08.080
And celebratory in the ways

00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:11.560
that the Vietnam War Memorial
was not perceived to be.

00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:16.390
The biggest, there were
many debates and fights.

00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:19.430
The most intense was about race.

00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:20.940
Everywhere you look,
doesn't matter

00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:23.120
if the war memorial doesn't
seem like it's going to be

00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:25.300
about race, it ends
up being about race.

00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:29.590
The original design had
38 all white figures.

00:46:29.590 --> 00:46:34.180
Which you know, turned
out to be a problem.

00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:37.850
And then there was
intense debate about which

00:46:37.850 --> 00:46:42.470
of the 19 figures in the
final design would be raced

00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:43.770
in what way.

00:46:43.770 --> 00:46:46.710
And when I talked to the
sculptor, Frank Gaylord

00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:48.080
on the telephone, one

00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:49.990
of the very first things
he said I asked him

00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:52.840
about the first figure, and he
said "God damn it, he's white.

00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:55.290
He has a broad nose,
but he's white.

00:46:55.290 --> 00:46:58.110
I'm white, and I
have a broad nose."

00:46:58.110 --> 00:47:02.950
So there was intense debate
about how big their lips were,

00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:06.270
whether or not that made
them look lazy, about whether

00:47:06.270 --> 00:47:08.420
or not they had limp wrists.

00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:13.540
So that's a very short answer
to a super interesting question.

00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:14.840
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:16.730
&gt;&gt; Brent D. Glass: I think we're
going to have the last question?

00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:18.330
Oh, two minutes, okay, good.

00:47:18.330 --> 00:47:21.430
&gt;&gt; I have the shortest
question for Mr. Savage

00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:25.280
for the Lincoln Memorial
on the National Mall,

00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:28.660
the Emancipation
Proclamation is omitted.

00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:29.960
Should it be there?

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:33.680
And was it omitted
accidently or deliberately?

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:35.010
&gt;&gt; Kirk Savage: Well
I'd say deliberately.

00:47:35.010 --> 00:47:40.250
Because the idea behind
the inscriptions was to try

00:47:40.250 --> 00:47:42.620
to avoid the issue of slavery.

00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:47.640
And to turn Lincoln from
the Emancipator figure

00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:50.770
that he had been to
more of a reunifier.

00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:52.910
So that's why they chose
the Gettysburg Address

00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:54.530
and the second inaugural.

00:47:54.530 --> 00:47:56.940
Of course, though, the problem
is the second inaugural has this

00:47:56.940 --> 00:48:00.230
incredible line about slavery
and about how the war was

00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:02.350
about slavery and
it's our punishment

00:48:02.350 --> 00:48:04.150
for the crime of slavery.

00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:07.200
It's really the only place
in the memorial landscape

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:10.500
of Washington that really
talks about the crime,

00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:13.390
the historical crime of slavery.

00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:15.610
So it's a mixed bat.

00:48:15.610 --> 00:48:16.910
&gt;&gt; Brent D. Glass:
I encourage you

00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:19.460
to go read the second inaugural
at the Lincoln Memorial.

00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:20.760
Of course you can look it up,

00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:22.860
but it's more powerful
reading it there.

00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:25.310
And then the Gettysburg
Address calling for a new birth

00:48:25.310 --> 00:48:28.920
of freedom I think suggests
what the war was all about.

00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:32.820
One more question, wrap it up.

00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:34.120
Sure, Jim.

00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:35.950
&gt;&gt; James Reston Jr: Well what
we haven't had time to talk

00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:37.250
about is this whole thing

00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:43.050
of contextualizing the
Civil War memorials.

00:48:43.050 --> 00:48:48.060
And there's a very interesting
effort to do that in Richmond.

00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:54.090
And right after 2000, a
Lincoln Memorial was built to go

00:48:54.090 --> 00:48:58.050
in front of the Civil
War museum in Richmond.

00:48:58.050 --> 00:49:04.180
It's a lovely statue with
Lincoln and his son, Ted,

00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:08.750
who visited Richmond when it was
still smoldering at the very end

00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:11.310
of the Civil War, he
was very much open

00:49:11.310 --> 00:49:13.310
to assassination there.

00:49:13.310 --> 00:49:15.280
So that is meant
to be a counterpart

00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:19.140
to the monument boulevard thing.

00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:21.940
But does that really
contextualize

00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:23.870
monument boulevard?

00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:25.310
I don't think so.

00:49:25.310 --> 00:49:27.470
&gt;&gt; Brent D. Glass: Our
authors will be around all day.

00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:29.260
Please give them a
round of applause

00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:31.060
for a wonderful [inaudible].

00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:33.730
[ Applause ]
