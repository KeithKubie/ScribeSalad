00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.300
We shouldn’t wait until there’s a great white shark in the water to appreciate how precious life is,

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.000
every moment counts.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.300
We’re always close to death,

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.800
even in the ordinary moments of life.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.500
There's so much to be thankful for,

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.100
which we usually neglect from the spoiled and bored assumption that it'll last forever.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.800
Life is at best 500,000 hours long,

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.500
if we are not prematurely devoured by an undersea predator.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.700
We should try so hard to use our days well

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.700
and make sure we can meet our end with as few regrets as possible.
