00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.000
Doug Walker: Luck of the Irish is just my kind of silly.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.900
It's low budget, corny, knows it, and has a ton of fun with it.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.520
The story centers around a boy named Kyle, who seems to be the luckiest kid in school.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.960
he always finds money, he makes the finishing shot on the basketball team,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.560
everyone can't believe how things always go his way.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.880
But one day at an Irish festival, his lucky medallion is stolen,

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.600
and suddenly, all his luck seems to be disappearing.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.980
But not only that, a lot of other strange stuff is going on.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.980
His mother starts to talk with an accent, he's getting shorter, there's little points on his ears growing,

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.800
his hair's turning red, and on top of all that, his parents refuse to tell him about his heritage.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.140
As you can guess, Kyle discovers that he's half-leprechaun.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.660
And the medallion that was around his neck is actually magic that was keeping him human the whole time.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.140
So the search is on to see who stole the medallion.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.500
Maybe one of the kids, or his angry grandfather, or who knows?

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.780
On the surface, it doesn't seem like there's a ton you can really do with this story,

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.080
but they seem to take advantage of it pretty well.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.920
Not only is there a fair amount of Irish lore, though I don't know how exactly authentic it is,

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.660
But the writing has some good lines and clever ideas, and the actors all have good comedic timing.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.520
So many of these lines could easily crash and burn,

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.180
but these actors are really trying and doing a good job, making a lot of these jokes hit.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.380
I mean, come on, they were smart enough to cast Lassie from Psych in there, they must know what they're doin'!

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.640
The film doesn't go quite as far as an idea like this should probably allow,

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.740
I mean, it would be nice to see more leprechauns, more of the fantasy world and so forth,

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.200
but for the most part, they just keep it in the real world. There's only one part where they actually travel.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.600
And even then, it's at night and kinda hard to see.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.180
But I get the feeling this was kind of on a low budget,

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.780
and honestly, for the budget they have, some of these effects are pretty good.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.560
This is 2001, and for a Disney Channel TV movie to have effects that look this good is actually kind of impressive.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.540
I should also comment that I like the way the movie is shot.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.480
I mean it's not amazing, it doesn't try to show off or anything,

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.860
But a lot of the shots always have a little bit of motion or an angle or a visual style to it.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.820
Again, it's nothing visually breathtaking, but you can tell they're constantly trying to say:

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.920
"How can we make this shot look a little bit more interesting than just doing a medium shot or a straight-on shot?"

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.060
They do have fun with those close-ups and tilted angles, but they never go too far to where it's distracting, either.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.160
If I did have a problem, it's that the last third slows down a little bit.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.560
You almost think the climax is gonna happen in this one place,

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.120
and then suddenly it changes to a basketball game, and...

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.900
Yeah, it's a basketball game. It's not like there's a ton of laughs you can get there.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.040
I mean they try, but... you know how these Disney movies go:

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.800
they wanna look cool during the basketball game, not exactly get a lot of laughs.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.580
But it more than makes up for it with some out-of-the-box thinking.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.280
For example, there's a scene where they're trying to find these thieves that stole a bunch of gold.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.940
They see a rainbow, and obviously, they say "it must be at the end of that!"

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.100
Yeah! It doesn't work the way you'd think, where a rainbow lands and gold is just gonna appear.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.480
The gold is already there, and the rainbow follows that.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.160
That's kind of clever thinking.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.580
The movie is full of nice little touches like that that aren't exactly knee-slappers, but still get a chuckle.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.300
Add on top of that actors that are legitimately charming, I enjoy watching,

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.180
plus a story and direction that didn't have much to work with, but still did its best and kept my interest,

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.160
I think this is a cute little adventure.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.360
Put on your green hats or whatever other Irish stereotypes you're fond of, and dance your way in for a viewing.
