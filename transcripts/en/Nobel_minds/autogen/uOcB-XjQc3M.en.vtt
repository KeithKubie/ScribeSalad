00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
you know it's always difficult to know

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510
you know it's always difficult to know
 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.519
you know it's always difficult to know
at any one time as a basic scientist

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:06.529
at any one time as a basic scientist
 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:08.660
at any one time as a basic scientist
whether what you're doing at that time

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670
whether what you're doing at that time
 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.570
whether what you're doing at that time
is you know going to have some

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580
is you know going to have some
 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.780
is you know going to have some
monumental significance I'm not sure my

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790
monumental significance I'm not sure my
 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.670
monumental significance I'm not sure my
work has monumental significance but it

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680
work has monumental significance but it
 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.710
work has monumental significance but it
certainly has been recognized as having

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720
certainly has been recognized as having
 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.950
certainly has been recognized as having
some significance the thing about basic

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960
some significance the thing about basic
 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.170
some significance the thing about basic
science is that we and anyone any one

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180
science is that we and anyone any one
 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.810
science is that we and anyone any one
day any one experiment you never really

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820
day any one experiment you never really
 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.939
day any one experiment you never really
know you try your best every single day

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949
know you try your best every single day
 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.400
know you try your best every single day
and I tell my students you know every

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410
and I tell my students you know every
 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.850
and I tell my students you know every
day that you that you work in the lab is

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860
day that you that you work in the lab is
 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.410
day that you that you work in the lab is
a day that you'll never have again and

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420
a day that you'll never have again and
 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.000
a day that you'll never have again and
so think very carefully to do the most

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010
so think very carefully to do the most
 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.040
so think very carefully to do the most
important thing that you can do every

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050
important thing that you can do every
 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.040
important thing that you can do every
day but the nature of science is is such

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050
day but the nature of science is is such
 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.779
day but the nature of science is is such
that if you're doing real research on

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789
that if you're doing real research on
 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.240
that if you're doing real research on
the frontier where nobody's ever been

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250
the frontier where nobody's ever been
 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.630
the frontier where nobody's ever been
you know it doesn't always work actually

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640
you know it doesn't always work actually
 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.580
you know it doesn't always work actually
the hardest thing about being a

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590
the hardest thing about being a
 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.849
the hardest thing about being a
scientist is you have to be prepared to

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859
scientist is you have to be prepared to
 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.639
scientist is you have to be prepared to
fail most of the time and a Nobel

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649
fail most of the time and a Nobel
 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.189
fail most of the time and a Nobel
laureate might be a scientist who fails

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199
laureate might be a scientist who fails
 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.750
laureate might be a scientist who fails
only ninety-nine percent of the time

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760
only ninety-nine percent of the time
 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.270
only ninety-nine percent of the time
maybe everybody else is a little bit

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280
maybe everybody else is a little bit
 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.370
maybe everybody else is a little bit
less luckier or whatever fails

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380
less luckier or whatever fails
 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.990
less luckier or whatever fails
ninety-nine point nine percent of the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000
ninety-nine point nine percent of the
 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.700
ninety-nine point nine percent of the
time so by definition what you're doing

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710
time so by definition what you're doing
 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.850
time so by definition what you're doing
at any one time is not it's a little

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860
at any one time is not it's a little
 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.350
at any one time is not it's a little
hard to know if it's the most important

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360
hard to know if it's the most important
 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.359
hard to know if it's the most important
on the other hand when it does happen

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369
on the other hand when it does happen
 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.539
on the other hand when it does happen
and it's happened to me actually twice

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549
and it's happened to me actually twice
 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.510
and it's happened to me actually twice
I've had very special moments and I kind

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520
I've had very special moments and I kind
 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.010
I've had very special moments and I kind
of understood and everybody around me

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020
of understood and everybody around me
 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.140
of understood and everybody around me
kind of understood that it was a special

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150
kind of understood that it was a special
 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.520
kind of understood that it was a special
moment we celebrated some of the basic

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530
moment we celebrated some of the basic
 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.310
moment we celebrated some of the basic
discoveries at the time they were made

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320
discoveries at the time they were made
 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.380
discoveries at the time they were made
that the with my co-workers you know

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390
that the with my co-workers you know
 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.530
that the with my co-workers you know
scientists it's also very important for

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540
scientists it's also very important for
 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.480
scientists it's also very important for
for students especially to understand

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490
for students especially to understand
 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.929
for students especially to understand
that that that science these days is not

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939
that that that science these days is not
 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.109
that that that science these days is not
a solo enterprise it's the work of a

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119
a solo enterprise it's the work of a
 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.980
a solo enterprise it's the work of a
team its students professors and we all

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990
team its students professors and we all
 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.719
team its students professors and we all
contribute not everyone gets recognized

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729
contribute not everyone gets recognized
 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.510
contribute not everyone gets recognized
with a Nobel Prize but but but there are

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520
with a Nobel Prize but but but there are
 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.570
with a Nobel Prize but but but there are
a lot of people who contribute
