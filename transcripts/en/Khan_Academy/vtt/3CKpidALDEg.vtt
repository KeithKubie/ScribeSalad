00:00:00.293 --> 00:00:01.837
- [Voiceover] So we've
already spent some time

00:00:01.837 --> 00:00:04.002
introducing ourselves to the idea

00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:05.904
of adding or subtracting

00:00:05.904 --> 00:00:08.045
positive and negative numbers.

00:00:08.045 --> 00:00:10.176
What I now what do in this video

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:12.039
is do a bunch of examples using the

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:15.008
adding negative numbers on
the number line exercise

00:00:15.008 --> 00:00:16.410
on Khan Academy,

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.638
so that we can think about
different ways to model,

00:00:19.638 --> 00:00:20.480
or think about,

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.913
or visualize adding and subtracting

00:00:22.913 --> 00:00:25.296
positive and negative numbers.

00:00:25.296 --> 00:00:27.112
So this question asks us,

00:00:27.112 --> 00:00:30.493
"Which number line model represents

00:00:30.493 --> 00:00:31.977
"the expression negative two

00:00:31.977 --> 00:00:33.646
"plus negative seven?"

00:00:33.646 --> 00:00:34.943
And a number line model seems

00:00:34.943 --> 00:00:36.644
like this really fancy thing,

00:00:36.644 --> 00:00:37.580
but they're just saying,

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.671
which of these diagrams,

00:00:39.671 --> 00:00:42.695
which of these drawings
are a way to think about

00:00:42.695 --> 00:00:45.612
what negative two plus negative seven is.

00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:46.876
So let's think about it.

00:00:46.876 --> 00:00:49.269
I want to start at negative two

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:52.599
and then to that I want
to add negative seven.

00:00:52.599 --> 00:00:54.178
So let's see what's going on here.

00:00:54.178 --> 00:00:57.240
This number line model

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.780
I guess we could call it,

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.753
it's saying this is positive
two right over here.

00:01:01.753 --> 00:01:03.509
It's to the right of zero.

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:06.826
Then it subtracts seven.

00:01:06.826 --> 00:01:08.153
This is the model that would be

00:01:08.153 --> 00:01:11.103
for positive two plus negative seven,

00:01:11.103 --> 00:01:14.677
or two, or positive two minus seven.

00:01:14.677 --> 00:01:16.346
But that's not what we have over here,

00:01:16.346 --> 00:01:18.617
we have negative two minus seven.

00:01:18.617 --> 00:01:19.813
This one right over here,

00:01:19.813 --> 00:01:21.477
let's see, this first...

00:01:21.477 --> 00:01:22.773
I guess you could say this thing,

00:01:22.773 --> 00:01:25.471
this arrow,

00:01:25.471 --> 00:01:27.078
it's going

00:01:27.078 --> 00:01:29.278
one, two, three, four, five

00:01:29.278 --> 00:01:30.374
to the left of zero.

00:01:30.374 --> 00:01:32.211
So starting at negative five,

00:01:32.211 --> 00:01:33.596
and then it goes another

00:01:33.596 --> 00:01:35.706
one, two, three, four

00:01:35.706 --> 00:01:37.110
to the left of that.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.170
So you could view this as

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.634
negative five minus four.

00:01:40.634 --> 00:01:41.867
Or you could view this as

00:01:41.867 --> 00:01:45.533
negative five plus negative four,

00:01:45.533 --> 00:01:47.812
but that's not what we have up here.

00:01:47.812 --> 00:01:48.594
And then this last one,

00:01:48.594 --> 00:01:49.577
hopefully this is the answer,

00:01:49.577 --> 00:01:50.543
otherwise there would be a mistake

00:01:50.543 --> 00:01:51.804
in the exercise.

00:01:51.804 --> 00:01:53.910
Let's see, we have this first arrow

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.500
that takes us two steps
to the left of zero.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.262
So, one, two.

00:01:58.262 --> 00:01:59.935
So this is negative two,

00:01:59.935 --> 00:02:01.746
and then we take another seven steps

00:02:01.746 --> 00:02:02.931
to the left of that.

00:02:02.931 --> 00:02:06.344
So one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

00:02:06.344 --> 00:02:07.997
So you can think of this arrow

00:02:07.997 --> 00:02:10.309
as representing negative two,

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:11.975
and then we're going to that,

00:02:11.975 --> 00:02:13.426
so we're starting from
this tip of this arrow.

00:02:13.426 --> 00:02:14.914
We're going to add a negative seven

00:02:14.914 --> 00:02:16.141
which makes us move seven

00:02:16.141 --> 00:02:19.049
to the left again to get to negative nine.

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:20.210
So that's definitely the model

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.361
that represents that expression.

00:02:22.361 --> 00:02:23.644
Let's keep going.

00:02:23.644 --> 00:02:25.165
All right.

00:02:26.873 --> 00:02:28.776
Which number line model represents

00:02:28.776 --> 00:02:31.606
the expression six plus negative two.

00:02:31.606 --> 00:02:33.145
So here, they've taken our number lines

00:02:33.145 --> 00:02:35.375
but they've made them go up and down,

00:02:35.375 --> 00:02:36.701
they've made them vertical.

00:02:36.701 --> 00:02:38.340
So we wanna really think about it.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.369
I want to start at six

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:41.164
and I want to add negative two.

00:02:41.164 --> 00:02:43.068
So on a vertical number line like this,

00:02:43.068 --> 00:02:44.980
it seems like we're
increasing as we go up.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.565
I want to start at six above zero.

00:02:48.565 --> 00:02:50.893
So, I want to start at six above zero,

00:02:50.893 --> 00:02:52.366
but then I want to add negative two,

00:02:52.366 --> 00:02:54.566
which should take me two steps back down.

00:02:54.566 --> 00:02:56.472
This one takes me two steps even higher,

00:02:56.472 --> 00:02:57.967
so this one right over here

00:02:57.967 --> 00:03:00.168
is positive six plus two,

00:03:00.168 --> 00:03:03.290
or positive six plus positive two.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.488
This one over here we're starting

00:03:04.488 --> 00:03:06.500
at positive four and
then we're adding two,

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.235
so that's not what we're talking about.

00:03:08.235 --> 00:03:09.201
This one over here,

00:03:09.201 --> 00:03:11.348
this big arrow, this tall arrow.

00:03:11.348 --> 00:03:13.128
This is going, it's pointing up.

00:03:13.128 --> 00:03:15.346
It gets us to positive six.

00:03:15.346 --> 00:03:17.346
The tip of the arrows are at positive six,

00:03:17.346 --> 00:03:19.012
But then we're going back down too.

00:03:19.012 --> 00:03:22.038
So this would be positive
six plus negative two.

00:03:22.038 --> 00:03:23.145
You could think of this arrow

00:03:23.145 --> 00:03:25.033
as representing positive six,

00:03:25.033 --> 00:03:27.733
and then this arrow is
representing negative two.

00:03:27.733 --> 00:03:29.666
It takes us two down.

00:03:29.666 --> 00:03:32.168
So if you take positive
six plus negative two,

00:03:32.168 --> 00:03:33.333
you do the positive six.

00:03:33.333 --> 00:03:35.206
And from the tip of your arrow,

00:03:35.206 --> 00:03:36.935
from there you can start the negative two,

00:03:36.935 --> 00:03:39.744
and you go two back down
and you end up at four.

00:03:39.744 --> 00:03:43.104
So it's definitely that
one right over there.

00:03:43.104 --> 00:03:45.449
This is surprisingly fun.

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:46.545
Let's keep going.

00:03:46.545 --> 00:03:48.167
Which number line model represents

00:03:48.167 --> 00:03:51.933
the expression negative 2/5 plus 4/5?

00:03:51.933 --> 00:03:53.442
So we're going to start at negative 2/5

00:03:53.442 --> 00:03:55.174
which is going to be, it's negative,

00:03:55.174 --> 00:03:57.084
it's going to be to the left of zero.

00:03:57.084 --> 00:03:57.684
So let's see,

00:03:57.684 --> 00:03:59.278
this arrow right over here,

00:03:59.278 --> 00:04:01.146
this is negative 4/5,

00:04:01.146 --> 00:04:04.496
so that's not going to be quite right.

00:04:04.496 --> 00:04:05.873
So the second choice,

00:04:05.873 --> 00:04:07.106
what's going on here?

00:04:07.106 --> 00:04:09.288
So if I start at zero,

00:04:09.288 --> 00:04:11.708
and then I'm going 2/5

00:04:11.708 --> 00:04:12.911
to the left of zero.

00:04:12.911 --> 00:04:15.813
So that's negative 2/5 and from that,

00:04:15.813 --> 00:04:17.811
I'm going to the right

00:04:17.811 --> 00:04:21.770
1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5.

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:22.769
So this looks right.

00:04:22.769 --> 00:04:23.928
This looks like negative 2/5,

00:04:23.928 --> 00:04:25.610
so I'm starting at zero,

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.200
I'm going to the left 2/5.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.013
So that's negative 2/5,

00:04:29.013 --> 00:04:30.133
and then I go to the right

00:04:30.133 --> 00:04:31.458
4/5 from that tip.

00:04:31.458 --> 00:04:33.003
&gt;From negative 2/5,

00:04:33.003 --> 00:04:34.938
I'm adding 4/5.

00:04:34.938 --> 00:04:36.078
So that looks right.

00:04:36.078 --> 00:04:37.015
Let's do one more.

00:04:37.015 --> 00:04:39.481
This is exciting.

00:04:39.481 --> 00:04:41.308
Even if you don't find it fully exciting,

00:04:41.308 --> 00:04:42.549
anything you do you should

00:04:42.549 --> 00:04:43.970
convince yourself it's exciting.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.380
You'll do a better job.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.898
Which number line model represents

00:04:46.898 --> 00:04:50.650
the expression five 1/2
plus negative three?

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.942
This is positive five 1/2,

00:04:52.942 --> 00:04:54.619
so I want to go five 1/2

00:04:54.619 --> 00:04:56.106
to the right of zero.

00:04:56.106 --> 00:04:57.979
This is five 1/2 to the left of zero,

00:04:57.979 --> 00:04:59.400
so that's negative five 1/2.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.804
That's not what I want to deal with.

00:05:00.804 --> 00:05:02.379
So this one looks interesting,

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:03.909
and this is actually five 1/2

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:05.607
to the left of zero as well,

00:05:05.607 --> 00:05:06.747
so it's probably going to be this

00:05:06.747 --> 00:05:08.162
but let's just look at it.

00:05:08.162 --> 00:05:11.185
So let's see, we go five
1/2 to the right of zero.

00:05:11.185 --> 00:05:12.845
So this is five 1/2,

00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:16.347
and then from that I go three left.

00:05:16.347 --> 00:05:18.975
So that in the end gets me to two 1/2.

00:05:18.975 --> 00:05:22.760
So it's this choice, right over there.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.113
Exciting.
