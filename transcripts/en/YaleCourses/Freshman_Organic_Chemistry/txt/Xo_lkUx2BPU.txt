Speaker 1:          00:02          Let's get started. Welcome to the parents who have made it today. Thank you for sending us your bright people to do a pay our salaries and learn from us. Uh, as, uh, the, we've spent most of the semester so far figuring out what bonds is and, and how quantum mechanics works and so on. But now we're trying to find out how it really happened, how people discovered, how chemistry in general and organic chemistry in particular work than we started with [inaudible]. And now we're in the next generation, which is salient in Sweden. And as we said last time, he was important for analysis. He got good atomic weights for 50 elements. We'll talk today about a electrolysis and dualism. Uh, he was important for his teaching and writing for the first half of the 19th century. He was the main man and in chemistry and his notation for composition that we talked about last time that we still use.

Speaker 1:          01:04          Okay, so now we're going to talk about atomic weights and equivalents and what was involved there. We started this last time. Remember showed how gay lose sock. I had an alternative to, uh, to Dalton. There was this question about, uh, what, even if you knew, uh, the proper ratios of elements, what you didn't know was the ratios of the atoms that were in them because you didn't know whether an atomic weight should be doubled or halved. So they had the question about silicon chloride was at sic sic l two S I sic l three, s I c l four. So how could you possibly settle something like this? Uh, Dalton did it by assuming that if you had only one common hat, one compound, it had to be one to one. Gay Lusaka went with the map, the volumes of the gases that were involved, which turned out ultimately to be correct.

Speaker 1:          01:52          Although it wasn't really widely accepted for about 60 years. But there was another neat way of doing it depending on crystals. Uh, mid Salish and Austrian, uh, had this device on which you mount a crystal and reflect light off it through a telescope. So when you do that, you know precisely if it comes right up the middle of the telescope, you know exactly what direction the, um, the plane of the surf, that surface of the crystal is. So what you can do then is rotate it by a certain number of degrees until some other face of the crystal reflects precisely, and then you can measure very, very accurately what the angle between those two faces is. So that was crystallography in those days before x-ray. Okay. So here's his paper on relating crystal shape to chemical proportions. There was sound like not closely related phenomena, but here he's talking about arsenates and phosphates and here are the pictures he drew. They drew a beautiful pictures of crystals in those days. If that's all you can do, you'll do it right? Uh, so he has an art. Betty saw that the crystals were the same shape for corresponding arsenates and phosphates. This diammonium by arson aid and the diammonium by phosphate, right? So he measured the angles and here's his table at the angles corresponding and you can see they're very, very close to one another. Those are the differences in tenths of degrees. So these crystals are precisely the same. Now what can you conclude from that?

Speaker 1:          03:30          Anybody got an idea where you can go from here? So you know that there's an arsenite and the phosphate with the same chemical composition,

Speaker 2:          03:39          right?

Speaker 1:          03:42          And they give exactly the same shape. So the thing that's things that packed together must be exactly the same. So they must have the corresponding know, however many arsenates there are arsenic Adams, there are in one, there must be exactly the same number of phosphorous atoms in the other. Otherwise they could not possibly be exactly the same shape. So now you know something that we, there was this need for relative atomic weights. Was Dalton, right? Was Water Aho or was Gailey's sock right? That it was h two o right? At least in this case, this thing called ISO morphism, the same shape of the crystals provided definitive atomic weight ratios for at least some of the Adam pairs. So arsenic, Adam's must play exactly the same role in arsenates that phosphorous atoms play in phosphates. And therefore, if you have a hundred grams of nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen that combines to give these these salts with 30.64 grams of phosphorous or 78.11 grams of arsenic, it must be that our snake Adam is 2.55 times as heavy as the phosphorous atom,

Speaker 2:          04:45          right?

Speaker 1:          04:46          That is, it can't be half that or twice that. It has to be exactly that because they have to be the same number to give exactly the same shape. Okay, so there was one way of determining this ratio, but it wasn't trivial. Okay? Now here's presale is his table of atomic and Mike, your weights from the or 1831 and if we zoom in on it a bit here, you can see he gave two columns for the atomic weights, one based on oxygen being 100 units and the other based on h with a bar across it being one. Now the bar across Adam's means that the atoms are doubled. You can have it without a bar, which is a single atom or the bar across. That means it's a doubled them. So he had actually noticed, if you go down the column there that if you assume h two is one, then obviously h here is a half,

Speaker 2:          05:34          right?

Speaker 1:          05:35          So these were the numbers he had in 1831 and we could compare them with what they would be nowadays if you scaled to oxygen as we defined it now to be 15 point 900900900 four and then you see that they're off by about 1% up or down. How does that compare with what Dalton was getting? Do you remember how accurate he was? He was about 10. So here in, in uh, 25 years, they've gotten 10 fold more accurate in what the atomic weights are. Okay. Uh, now combustion analysis was, was, was, and would continue to be from the time of Avazi a white through the whole 19th century, the heavy carrier for organic chemistry. Okay, here's the way, but salients did combustion analysis. So he started with a tube in which he put a half a gram of organic substance that was going to be analyzed, three grams of sodium chlorate you remember?

Speaker 1:          06:33          That's what gay Lusaka used to burn things with. Why that rather than air, why did Gail Lusaka use it rather than air? Do you remember? Cause a lot of things wouldn't burn in air. Right. They would char. Okay. So, but he used this, they use Galeas socks oxidizing agent and 50 grams of sodium chloride was ground up with this stuff just so that, uh, the reaction wouldn't get out of hand so it wouldn't explode. Okay. So those are put in there. Then he heated up the neck and drew it out and plugged it in to that bulb on the right. Right. So he joined it to that bulb, which would serve for collecting water, which is a combustion product and a calcium chloride drying tube, which would get the, which would get the rest of the water that didn't condense and the bulb. Okay. Then he assembled this thing along the bottom so that the gasses that came out after the water was removed what exit in and be collected in this bell jar over mercury.

Speaker 1:          07:32          And in that there was a bulb that floated, which held potassium hydroxide, solid potassium hydroxide, which would absorb the co two, thereby separating it from the oxygen that would come through. You get oxygen just by heating sodium chlorate. Okay. And then he closed the top with a piece of, of glove leather. So the mercury that was floating on couldn't, little drops of mercury wouldn't get in because as you know from hefting it, that would change the way to good deal. Okay. So what he did was build a fire and move that barrier back. So with heat from one end to the other and the gases would come out and bubble up in the bell jar. Right. And, and fill up a good deal of the bell jar. Right. Uh, and notice that the, that the tube had been wrapped with metal to keep it from popping when it got hot in the fire because there'd be pressure inside in order to bubble through the mercury.

Speaker 1:          08:23          Uh, okay. So then the cools it off the gas contracts, right? The, the Koh absorbs co two. So you're left with oxygen in the bell jar. And the, and the CEO two is absorbed on the potassium hydroxide, but he then after the mercury rises, as the gas gets absorbed, but after the mercury stops rise, he waits 12 hours to make sure he's got all the co two absorbed because it has to get through the glove leather. Right. So it takes quite a while. It took a, you know, much more than the day to do it to do an analysis. Uh, so after it stops rising, he takes it apart. It takes the glove leather off the top ways that and finds out how much co two there was. So he's got the water and the CO2, therefore the hydrogen and the carbon and this was a much better way of doing it.

Speaker 1:          09:10          Then, uh, then Lavoie CA's which required, you know, three or four people operating in that big machine. Okay. Electricity was another really important contribution from butts alias. Okay. Uh, to, to, uh, but it also was a contribution to the royal institution in London, uh, where this is a demonstration of a, of a n two o at the Royal Institution, but the guy holding the bellows there is, uh, is Humphry Davy who became the head of the Royal Institution and was the head then a big science. So in 18, seven and eight, he made some very important experiments. It was based on the work of Volta who was just a little more than a decade earlier, who had invented this thing shown on his desk here, which was the voltaic pile, which was a pile of copper and zinc, uh, disks. And when you put copper and zinc together, you can get 1.1 volts out of it.

Speaker 1:          10:14          Okay. So this was going to be big science. So he put together 24 such pairs of things, which, which uh, which meant you could get 26 volts. Those were six inches square. Right? Then he made another, there's the battery incidentally, that Butts alias had, which is instill in Stockholm. Okay. Then he put one with a hundred such things. So he could get 110 volts. Then he made another one. They were only four inches square now of 165 volts. Right? And then he could hook them together in series so he could get 301 volts across this thing. And then he tried doing experiments with it. So this is what he said.

Speaker 1:          10:58          I acted upon aqueous solutions of potash and soda. You know what potash is? Potassium hydroxide and soda. Soda is sodium hydroxide saturated that common temperatures by the highest electrical power I could command and which was produced by a combination of Voltaic batteries belonging to the Royal Institution containing 24 plates of copper and zinc, 12 inches square, a hundred plates, six inches and 100 and 554 inches square. So this is that battery, as I just said, put 300 and whatever number of volts across this thing. Though there was a high intensity of action. The water of the solution alone was affected in hydrogen and oxygen, disengaged with the production of much heat and violent effervescence. I could believe that. And so, so he wasn't about to give up. He tried it again, the presence of water appearing. Thus to prevent any decomposition. I used potash, so potassium in igneous fusions.

Speaker 1:          11:55          So he put a flame to it and melted it by means of a stream of oxygen gas from a gas almond or applied to the flame of a spirit lamp which was thrown onto a platinum spoon containing potash. This alkali was kept for some minutes in a strong red heat and in a state of perfect fluidity, the spoon was preserved in communication with the positive side of the battery. I don't know how he held this thing, uh, of the power of 106 inches highly charged. And the connection from the negative side was made by a platinum wire by this arrangement. Some brilliant phenomenol were produced. The potash appear to conduct her in a high degree and as long as the communication was preserved to most intense light was exhibited at the negative wire and a column of flame, which seemed to be open to the development of combustible matter arose from the point of contact.

Speaker 1:          12:46          Right? Then he did another experiment, a small piece of pure potash had been exposed for a few seconds to the atmosphere. So as to give a conducting power to the surface was placed upon an insulated disc of [inaudible], connected with the negative side of the battery of the power of 250 of 604 in a state of intense activity and a platinum wire communicating with the positive side was brought in contact with the upper surface of the Alkali, small globules having a high metallic luster and being precisely similar invisible characters to quicksilver. What's quicksilver? Live silver, right? Mercury of course. Okay. Some of which burnt with explosion and bright flame as soon as they were formed and others remained and we're merely tarnished and finally covered with a white film which formed on their surfaces. What was this right? He electrolyzed uh, he says potash, potassium hydroxide. What did he get?

Speaker 1:          13:41          Potassium metal. So He'd discovered a new element and from soda he got sodium from potash, potash. She got potassium. Okay. Now this was a great triumph for English science, but those were the period of great rivalry. 18 seven and eight the peninsular war was going on in Portugal, Spain against the French in particular against Napoleon. Napoleon had studied science a certain amount as a student at the AA call, Amelie tear in Paris. In fact, he had been examined by Laplas, the Lavoie, CA's a colleague and measuring heat. So, uh, he wasn't about to knuckle under to England in this, so he got his crew together, including Gailey's sock and said, why haven't we discovered this? And Galia [inaudible] said, we don't have the battery. He says, you've got your battery. So this was the battery. They that Galeas sat constructed at garden. So it consisted of 601 kilogram copper plates and 603 kilograms zinc plates. So he had 2.6 tons of metal and in in six different troughs here. And then he hooked them together in series.

Speaker 1:          14:56          Alright, so he's now got 650 volts. Now the Napoleon was interested in science, so he came to visit the lab one day and there's an account of this in the, in the biography of Sam, of Humphry Davy with that rapidity, which characterized all his motions. And before the attendance could enter pose any precaution, he thrust the extreme wires to the battery under his tongue and received a shock, which nearly deprived him of sensation after recovering from its effects, he quitted the laboratory without making any remark and was never afterwards heard to refer to the subject. Okay, so that was the end of the French competition with Humphry Davy. But Davey himself built one with a thousand plates with so 2,200 volts. And with this, he was able to prepare a bunch of elements in addition to sodium and potassium, Boron, magnesium, calcium, and barium were all due to Sir Humphry Davy.

Speaker 1:          15:57          But that wasn't really the most important thing for chemistry. W supplied more than new elements. It's supplied an idea. And the idea was the organizing principle for what was called dualism. And dualism was the idea that there were things that were positive and things that were negative and they would be attracted to one another. Not only would they be attracted one another, but they could trade partners. Okay. So remember we saw last time that the, that the alchemists already had vitriolic and Kukri or, or copper sulfate. So here we saw last time was copper sulfate. Let me see if I can get this thing going here.

Speaker 2:          16:34          Oh, here.

Speaker 1:          16:41          Is it? Half tomorrow. There we go. So there's copper sulfate and nice and blue. But let me get the light behind. That should be good. Okay, so we'll put some in here. So this is copper as a, as a positive stuff and sulfate is negative stuff. And now we'll take sodium hydroxide. So, and put a little bit in. So there's a precipitate and actually it's much more complicated than people thought it was in those days. It gets quite dark blue if you put a lot of a lot in there. But now a white whitish precipitates going to form, but you don't see very well here. Maybe it doesn't know how to focus on that.

Speaker 2:          17:27          Uh, let's see. I can get something for it to focus on

Speaker 1:          17:36          there. There you see the precipitate. Okay, so obviously something happened, right? And according to dualism, this is what happened, right? You Mix it with caustic soda and you have ab and CD, positive and negative on the left, sodium hydroxide, copper sulfate, and they change partners and you get a precipitate. So you have, it's explained by electricity. And this is then is what dualism was. Uh, so we've noticed that this is our family tree. You remember? And now we've looked at a elemental analysis, Adams and dualism. Notice that people are entered into this, not by when they made their contribution because they made it at many different times, but by when they were born. So you can see what the generations were. So first we had lavoie ca then presale, he is, and now we're into a new generation of people who are going to contribute when they get to be 20 to 30 years old down here.

Speaker 1:          18:29          So the next thing we're going to talk about is urea and isomers and the benzoyl radical and the theory of substitutions and types. Okay. And our players are John Baptiste onto, they do ma in France and Leiby and volar in Germany. And they were all born right around 1800. Between 1,818 three okay. And here they are on the, on the, uh, outside of the building. So we're going to look at villa and liebig. Now, here's the volar writing to Brett's alias in Sweden. He's going to be the next generation, uh, saying having developed the greatest respect for you through studying your writings. I've always thought it would be my greatest good fortune to be able to practice this science under the direction of such a man, which has always been my fondest desire. Those who have seen such letters will recognize these as, as consistent up to the present day.

Speaker 1:          19:23          Uh, he said, he goes on to say, although I earlier had planned to become a physician, and at the end he says with the greatest respect treed Richville Villar from Frankfurt on mine. He was a great guy. They carried on correspondence their whole lives. It's really entertaining. And because partly because Voler had sort of a lame mish sense of humor and was a cartoonist. So, for example, in this letter to put Sally's in 1837 so this is, uh, 10 years later, he said to see this old friend palm stet again, especially here in Gooding and was a real delight. He was just the same old guy with the sole exception that he no longer wears the little toupee swept up over his forehead as he used to do. So Villar drew this cartoon in there. Okay. But what do you know what you know volar for probably is urea.

Speaker 1:          20:12          How many people have heard about villa and urea? Okay. But the interesting thing is that the urea was not the main contribution. He also invented the aluminum incidentally are discovered aluminum, but urea wasn't really the main for our purposes, wasn't the main contribution from this, uh, work of, of volar. And you'll see that there are a couple of problems for next Wednesday and readings on the web that support this with original documents. So he wrote in 1828 to produce alias. Perhaps. You still remember the experiment I carried out in that fortunate time when I was working with you in which I found that whenever one tries to react cyanic acid with ammonia, a crystalline substance appears, which is a nerd behaving neither like CYA eight nor like ammonia. So that, that's what was funny, that it didn't behave like you would expect for ammonium cyanide. So the idea was it should be a double decomposition reaction.

Speaker 1:          21:08          This dualistic thing where you change partners. So you start with ammonium chloride, silver Saya and eight. That was another way he did it and he and he, you should get ammonium signed eight and silver chloride was as a precipitate. So then you can, you've prepared ammonium signing, but you can test whether ammonium signed. Eight is the salt ammonium signed, eight one is to see whether it has the ammonium ion in it and that you can tell by pulling the proton, often changing it back into ammonia, which you can smell. Okay. But when he treated it with sodium hydroxide, he didn't get ammonia. Okay. Or you can test. So it doesn't behave like an ammonium salt, nor did it behave like a, like a cyanide salt. If you treat it with acid, you don't get the smell of science cyanic acid. And if you treat it with LEDs, you don't get led sign and eight.

Speaker 1:          21:56          So it appears not to be either ammonia or the cyanic acid anymore. Okay. But what it did do when treated with nitric acid was to give brilliant crystal flakes. So the crystals were what allowed him to identify it and he knew that you've got the same thing when you treated urea with nitric acid, just like those from urea and nitric acid. Right. So this raised the question for its alias, wrote to Villar in reply to that, it is a unique situation that the assault nature so entirely disappears. It doesn't look like dualism anymore when the acid of the ammonia combined one that will certainly be most enlightening for future theory. So might Imodium, Cya, Nate actually be urea, might urea ammonium Cya. Nate with very curious properties. So vola wrote back to personalities. I recently performed a small experiment appropriate to the limited time I have available.

Speaker 1:          22:57          He was doing a lot of teaching at this time, which I quickly completed in which thank God, did not require a single analysis. That was what was a pain in the neck to do. So this was, this is the data from, from uh, Villers letter and the same thing was published his paper in 1828. So it turned out that doctor proud to physician in London had already analyzed urea and reported its composition in terms of nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. That is its ultimate analysis. And volar without doing an experiment, knew what the analysis should be for ammonium sayand aid, right? Because he had births, aliases, atomic weights, so he could calculate for a substance of that formula what the percent by weight should be. And they agreed. You can see very, very well. So it looked like urea and ammonium signed. It had the same analysis and therefore where the same thing, okay, the discrepancies were less than 2%. Remember the, the atomic weights are only good to about 1% okay. So the, therefore these things appear to be identical. In fact, it's interesting to compare them with the modern values, which you see here. What do you notice in the first row?

Speaker 2:          24:22          Okay,

Speaker 1:          24:23          when you compare the numbers in the first row, Russell?

Speaker 2:          24:27          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          24:27          What's the same? Which is better experiment or theory?

Speaker 2:          24:34          What?

Speaker 1:          24:36          No, no. The first, the first is Prouts analysis. The first column, the last column is Brett's alias volar theory. And the middle is what we think is correct because it's based on what we have. Now what do you say? Aha. So there is a good lesson for us, right? Experiment is better than theory, but if you look more closely, there's a much more interesting story here. So the moral is don't dry lab, don't be like Lavoie Oza and try to make your experiments conform to theory. Right? So because of that dot, Dr Prout has gotten a reputation among historians of science as a paragon of accuracy and honesty. The very model for x lab work. Right? Okay. But let's look more carefully. You notice, for example, that he didn't make these things add up to a hundred percent. Would you expect them to? What would love, what would happen if it had been Lavoie Xia doing it?

Speaker 1:          25:31          What would they add it to? 100% exactly here at this. And why not? Because he's being honest. Maybe. Okay. So notice incidentally that the theory didn't add up to a hundred percent. Now how do you get those numbers? How would volar have gotten those numbers? He decided how many atoms of nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, there are in the compound. He'd see according to the atomic weights, how much each of those would way he'd add them all together. That would be the total. And then he'd divide each one by the total to get how many percent it was. Is that clear to everyone how you do about it? So how do you do that and not get it to add to a hundred percent? Well, I recalculate it using Burt's alias numbers and that's what I got. Now you'll notice a couple things here. One here, you'll notice what,

Speaker 2:          26:30          okay,

Speaker 1:          26:30          did he just truncated numbers? He didn't round them off, right? So it's always going to be low and indeed it is low. His um, but that, that's not low enough. Right? What else do you notice Angela? He switched the numbers in the last row.

Speaker 2:          26:51          Okay.

Speaker 1:          26:54          He made an error. But the important thing is he didn't notice. He made the error. He added it up and sought. It was 99.8 and thought, well, what the heck? It's 99.8. It didn't because this was early days of doing this kind of stuff. Okay. Now, so we come over to doctor prout is this experimental candor? Well, you find out if you add the numbers, it's actually 99.94 or five he added wrong. Okay. And now, but those things really agreed right now. You wonder how did old doctor prout do this to measure it to one part in 5,000 right? It turned out he measured the volume of the gas and Hoodie reported was 6.3 cubic inches of gas. Right? So was he just lucky that it happened to be right to force significant figures?

Speaker 2:          27:47          No,

Speaker 1:          27:48          because that's not how he did the experiment. What he reported was not actually experimental. He had a theory about atomic weights. His theory was that everything was made of hydrogen, which isn't so far wrong in terms of weight, right? Because a proton and the neutron and have the same way to Proton is hydrogen. So everything is a sum of protons and neutrons. Prac for weight. The electrons are don't count for much. Right? So it's not actually such a bad, uh, theory. So in his system, carbon was six, oxygen, eight, nitrogen 14, you know, that was what Integer, you multiply them by. Incidentally, hydrogen was called protitle from Proto, let's say from Ila [inaudible], which means the first substance. Okay? So he had this theory. So what he did was do a proximate analysis, get about what the ratio is, figure out what the ratio should be in terms of small whole numbers, and then multiplying by his atomic weights. That's, so these numbers are not really experimental numbers. They're more likely Lavoie Waze.

Speaker 2:          28:48          All right. So, uh,

Speaker 1:          28:52          so what he said was it was one, one to one, and that gives those numbers. Okay. So proud. Did dry lab by making an approximate analysis and reporting results corrected by his theory and so much for the paragon of accuracy and honesty as far as we would see it. Okay. But his theory was better than parts alias as experiments.

Speaker 2:          29:15          That's interesting.

Speaker 1:          29:18          Okay, so now ammonium sign it to Rio. Let's review that from the point of view of what we've been talking about. So you have ammonium, what makes it reacted?

Speaker 2:          29:32          Dana?

Speaker 1:          29:36          Hi Homo or low Lumo. It's got a positive charge. That's

Speaker 2:          29:42          one clue. Anybody got an idea, John?

Speaker 1:          29:52          And what? What do you suppose that low little bio is in terms of localized orbitals? We're not going to talk about things to go over the whole molecule. There's not much to deal with here at pneumonia.

Speaker 2:          30:05          You and you can't hear very well

Speaker 1:          30:16          sigma star of Nh. Okay. So that'll be a, that'll be the Lumo. How about a homo on the other side?

Speaker 2:          30:25          There's a hint.

Speaker 1:          30:27          Okay. Unshared pair on nitrogen with a negative charge. Okay, so we've got these and we can do the, the make and break trick attack the Sigma Star with that.

Speaker 2:          30:38          Right?

Speaker 1:          30:39          So we've got back to ammonia and cyanic acid, the uh, possible starting place for getting there. But if you have these two things, you can react them with one another. What makes ammonia reactive? Nh. Three. High Homo. The unshared payer. And how about the cyanic acid? What do you see that it looks like a functional group. Don't worry too much about how big it has to be. Just see something that looks familiar. C O Double Bond. Pi Star, right. Okay. Now so we can, so one of these can attack the other and we could arrange them like that and draw curved Arrow and we could attack the co double bond. But you could also attack the CN double bond. And in fact these aren't so different because when you attack one and make an unshared pair on the other, in this case, for example, that high homo on the nitrogen, the end minus can be stabilized by mixing with the Pi Star of the carbon eel.

Speaker 1:          31:43          Right? So you could actually draw it either way. So it really doesn't make any difference which way you draw it at the beginning. But what you can do is then have a further reaction that the homeowner on the bottom reacting with the sigma star. Again, although they probably can't line up bright within a molecule, it's probably one molecule attacking another molecule to do this. Okay. And get the hydrogen transfer. And that is urea. Okay. So there's how you go from ammonium signed eight d urea. It's quite uneasy, a chain of events. You could have done it the other way too like that and you'd get this compound. But those molecules, those molecules that the urea and this one can lose a proton, go back on Louis, go back on one side or the other. And ultimately you get the one that's more stable, which is the one that has the carbon oxygen double bond, which is a very stable molecule, a very stable grouping as we'll learn later in terms of law.

Speaker 1:          32:43          You can actually understand it in terms of Homo Lumo mixing here too. But any rate, that's what happened. So the question arises, can ammonium cyanide exist or does it always change? Is there such assault or does it always change to, to uh, urea. And in fact it done. It's our old pal and you're a great uncle. Uh, in 1998 with Kenneth Harris did an x ray structure that showed that you can have ammonium sign eight. This was the first time that had ever been proved to be to exist. And there's what it, what it looks like, but notice the nitrogens on the ammonia there point toward oxygen's not toward nitrogens. So it's not, so you couldn't, from this arrangement, you couldn't have done that thing that we, that we, the mechanism that we drew in order to get from here to there. Okay. So but that, but the fact of getting urea of product, of, of uh, of animal metabolism from purely as far as they were concerned, inorganic things which is said to have done away with the idea of vitalism was not from my perspective, the most important contribution here because this is what Voltaire wrote toward the end of that paper in 1828 I refrain from all considerations which so naturally suggest themselves from this fact is that is that ammonium signed eight and urea have the same analysis especially in respect to the composition ratios of organic substances and re in respect to similar elemental and quantitative compositions among compounds with very different properties as maybe supposed among others of full Minnick acid and cyanic acid.

Speaker 1:          34:27          We already did those. That was a problem early on when we were drawing Lewis structures, so two different arrangements at the same atoms and have a liquid hydrocarbon in the old defiant gas, the Ola finance gas, the gas that will make an oil is ethylene and ch two ch two but that's very similar to the, that's exactly the same ratio of Adams as you have in a long hydrocarbon. If it has a double bond in it, it must be left to further investigation of many similar cases to decide what general laws can be defined there from. Now this, this is an interesting point because when people have certain tools available, they tend to think that that's all the tools that could be available and therefore it gives all the information that's possible, right? So if what you can do is elemental analysis, you think that once you have the ratio of the elements, you know everything about the substance.

Speaker 1:          35:23          But what he shows here is that there can be different substances that have the same elemental analysis like urea and ammonium cyanide. So the possibility of saw Mariza's showed there was more to be known. Then people thought when all they could do was elemental analysis. So full Minuchin cyanic acid was very important. As we'll see in just a second. Now puts alias wrote a paper just two years later in 1830 on the composition of tartaric acid. Remember we, we spoke before about how pervasive tartaric acid is in the 19th century and the development of organic chemistry and receive, make acid also called John's acid from the vose, uh, on the atomic weight of lead oxide together with general marks on substances that have the same composition but different properties. So he found that tartaric acid and this John's acid from the vogue also called receive make acid, had exactly the same analysis their salts did right.

Speaker 1:          36:24          And here in fact, as a picture of it, I have the actual stuff right here. This is from a court, from a wine bottle and on top of it here, if we're lucky, see, uh, you can see those. And that's the, that we, we took one of the crystals and put it on the x Ray. There's what they look like. They're beautiful little crystals and their calcium. Tartrate. So I remember it. You get a tartaric acid grows from tartar on the walls of the wine barrels. Okay. But this is what was important, I thought at, he wanted to give a name for this phenomenon, things that had the same analysis, but we're clearly different. I thought it necessarily to choose between the words homo synthetic and ISO Merrick. The former is built from homos equivalent and synth atos put together the latter from Eso. Mary's has the same meaning, although it only properly says put together from the same pieces.

Speaker 1:          37:23          The latter has the advantage with respect to brevity and Ufuk [inaudible]. So it's shorter and it sounds easier to say. So from now on, we're going to choose isomers isomer to talk about this phenomenon by isometrics substances. I understand those which possess the same chemical composition and the same atomic. By that he means molecular weight, but different properties. Okay, so that's where isomers came from. It showed there was more to be discovered. There must be something about how these pieces are put together that's different. But how can you possibly find that out? Just by doing reactions in weighing things. Okay. Same chemical composition, but different properties. Okay? So there's more to chemistry than the analytical composition, which is what they were good at measuring. Now we know the importance of atomic arrangement or structure. So there are four cs that we'll organize things about, composition, constitution configuration and con formation.

Speaker 1:          38:25          But you gotta be, patient does take a little while to get there. It was several more decades. Okay? Now these, uh, isomers of CNO have been calculated to death in 2004 and we actually did a problem, sat and showed these earlier on. But here's what they are. They're cyanic acid. And notice this is the same anti in, but you pulled the proton off one end and put it on the other. It's somewhat less stable, but they interconvert easily. Okay? There's the one, when you put nitrogen in the middle, it's considerably higher. That's called full Minnick acid. And if you put the hydrogen on the other end of that one. Now the bottom one is what volar we're working with, but the top one was being studied by the other Guy Liebig, the full Minnick acid. And the name comes from Fullman, which means lightning because I like so many young lads leave big enjoyed things that would blow up, right?

Speaker 1:          39:21          He blew the window out of the pharmacy where he was, where he was serving as a, as an apprentice, right? And then he went to gay loose sock to work on silver fulminate, which is not great stuff to work on as people who know from fulminate snow, but any on 1824, he was in Paris working on that. And Galas sock noticed the paper from, from Voler on the analysis of silver it and saw that they had the same analysis. So he, he got them together. Gay Lusaka did. Now know that when we're going to talk much more about the interaction of those two guys, but notice in this portrait of leaving that there is a device down in the bottom right. Remember, people when they got their portraits made always put something they thought was significant there. So this is what he thought was significant. And here it is.

Speaker 2:          40:08          Okay.

Speaker 1:          40:09          It's not the actual one. This is, uh, uh, made by our glass blower.

Speaker 2:          40:14          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          40:15          And you've seen it before. For example, you come by this, when you're hurrying to class and notice right there, same thing, right? Or if any of you are a student members of the American Chemical Society that's on the logo because that was the most important device of the 19th century for organic chemistry. It's called the five bulb apparatus. The food's Kugel opera. Okay. And it was used by liebig for analysis. So here's how [inaudible] did his analysis and you can see the, the five bald apparatus here. So, so he had a too much like Brett's aliases in which the, he put burning charcoal in there to heat it up and generate the gases, but on a much smaller scale than Brits alias did. Okay. It came through a drying agent that collected the water, that was a product, and then it came into the, this the fifth Kugel Operat, uh, which was the co two collectors. So in here with sodium hydroxide, right. And what the way it worked was, it was tilted a little bit. You notice that? That it's, that it's propped up here with some pieces of wood so that the bottom isn't flat. It's tilted like this. Okay, so the gas comes in.

Speaker 2:          41:45          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          41:47          And because it's tilted, it bubbles from one to the next. Right. So mix as well and absorbed. So you don't remember Lavoie Z. I needed a couple of guys standing there to stir those things so that the CEO too, this was self collecting, right? And then at the end, you're cool. You're cool. The thing I'm now notice, what do you notice about the bulbs? Here? There are different size and you had to put it this way, not this way. Why did you have to do it this way?

Speaker 2:          42:21          Okay.

Speaker 1:          42:22          Because what happened at the end? You stop the fire and it would suck back. So this had to be big enough to hold all the liquid. This one didn't. So they were different size. You don't want to make both of them big because you want to keep it as light as possible. It was made out of very thin glass. So there's only one that still exists that, that, uh, that Leiby cad. And, uh, so it was tilted for the reason we said, and here's the, here's the original one, which is still in, in, uh, in Giesen in Germany where he was a professor then. I, but this was a great advance because with this, a single student could do three analyses in a day rather than whether than, uh, Lavoie Zia is big machine that required for people working forever or, or, but sale Ileus, which required, you know, waiting overnight for the co two to be absorbed all and so on.

Speaker 1:          43:21          So this was the most important thing. And everybody, all the students who wanted to be organic canvas went to learn how to do this in Giessen. So liebig is every, almost every one's great, great, great, great, great. Whatever, grandfather in chemistry, because all the people who went out to teach studied how to do this with him in Giessen. So here's a portrait a little bit later portrait of, of uh, liebig after he had gone to Munich to be a big wheel and, and uh, but again, he chose in his portrait to have a picture of the film of Kugel. Operat. But if you look at it carefully, you see something very interesting. You see what it is.

Speaker 1:          44:01          As far as I know no one ever noticed this before. It's hooked up backwards. How could he possibly have hooked it up backwards? He must told hundreds of students over the years, look, when you put it together, you put it this way, not this way. It's like which to buy the condenser you connect to the water, right? It's exactly the same kind of thing, right? So I just think that's amazing that he did. He didn't notice that. But anyhow, uh, there we got it backwards. Okay. This was his teaching laboratory, which still exists in Giessen. It's a museum. It's interesting to go there and there's a, uh, uh, on the wall, there's this thing and it shows all of his students and Grad students and great grands students who became distinguished professors. And the ones in red are ones who got the Nobel prize, the ones with red on them, and you could, you could extend it now.

Speaker 1:          44:59          It just stops in the middle of the 20th century practically everyone's descended from Lee. Be Concluding you. Okay, this is his lab and here this is uh, uh, here's the orientee Gosa from Mexico and he was, he was supposed to be so good at analysis that he could do better than leaving did. Right. So he's the one that got to hold the five co five bulb apparatus. And what do you notice about it? He's holding it upside down. The potassium hydroxide would run out, right? And this guy is AWS Hoffman who there's a, there's this thing of him is a master in shining teacher of chemistry at triumphant discover of analysts and aniline dyes. And he also was the guy that was really good at languages and, and devised a lot of the names we use nowadays. So we'll talk about that later and hear in the background.

Speaker 1:          45:57          Looking through a window into the lab is, it looks to me, I'm not sure that that's what it is, but it looks like a bust. Is it look like a bus to you. And if it's a bust, it's probably this bust of Levy. So there's, it's fun to go there. Okay. So in 1832 leave, Vic and volar collaborated to develop the law, the radical theory, and we'll just give an introduction to that and not go all the way through it. So leave, we can fully remember had been introduced by Gailey's SOC. So they were the same age and doing similar kinds of things. So they first met in Frankfurt at 1825 and five years later when they were writing, they first used the familiar, you know, like two and in French or do in Germany. If you're a really great friends with someone, you know, within the family, you use that. So they became great pals and in 1832, uh, volar said, I longed to do some more significant work. Shouldn't we try to shed some light on the confusion about the oil of bitter almonds. But where to get material. Right. So you know, Baker, JT Baker didn't exist then, but if they were now they could just order up a order up a bottle of it. So C, can you smell this? Yeah, you recognize the owner here. We'll pass it around carefully. Don't drop it.

Speaker 1:          47:23          It's not that bad, but you don't want to drop it and see if you recognize the odor. Like almonds is the oil of better almonds. Good. Okay. Okay. So in June of 1832 just the next month, liebig wrote to his pal volar and said, my poor dear volar, how empty is every comfort against such a loss because his young wife had just died. When I think how content happy you were during your move, what attachment and love you had for one another. The good wife, so young and full of life, so irreplaceable for her parents and for you. Come to us Derval are, although we may not be able to give you a comfort, we will perhaps be able to help you bury your grief. Stayed in castle at this time would only be detrimental to your health. We need to be busy with something. I have just been able to get some of Migdal and from Paris and I'm ordering 25 pounds of bitter almonds.

Speaker 1:          48:16          You must not travel. You must busy herself, but not in castle. I haven't had the courage to tell my wife yet. Come to us. I expect you at the end of this week. Know what he didn't want to tell her about was the death of Fuller's wife obviously. Okay, so then in July volar says it came, the oil of bitter almonds has come with the books from Paris. I've kept half of it and I'm here with sending you the rest. I've already started all kinds of experiments with it without being able to obtain any precise results. It seems to be a hard nut. This is an example of [inaudible] lame sense of humor. He did this all the time. I'm coming soon to you and we'll be able to report so they work together for two weeks on this and develop the most important theory on basis of these experiments. Volar returned. He said, here I am again in my gloomy lonesomeness not knowing how to thank you for all the love with which you took me in and kept me for so long. How happy I was to work with you from moment to moment here with, I'm sending the paper on oil of bitter almonds. So next time we'll talk about what they did with their oil and bitter almonds.
