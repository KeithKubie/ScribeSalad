00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.250
We are approaching
the end of day eight.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.530
Students are still working.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.410
Today is the first day that
they're off on their own.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.750
I didn't record a
confessional last night,

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.190
because I sort of forgot to.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.173
But yesterday was the last
official day of lecture.

00:00:19.173 --> 00:00:21.400
It was on post-production.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.400
That's been a challenge to
balance context, and sort

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.020
of the more bigger
picture digital literacy,

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.590
understanding the medium
type things with just

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.953
the practical things
that they need

00:00:37.953 --> 00:00:39.950
to know to do their project.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.560
And given a small
amount of time,

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.910
there's always been a
compromise of something.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.030
Yesterday was great.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.310
I think when I heard
Josh read his script,

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.730
it was one of my favorite
moments in class.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.120
First of all, his idea
had come such a long way.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.960
And his delivery
was very good, too,

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.010
and he said that he had watched
Andrea from the day before,

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.101
and tried to pick
up tips from her.

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:12.120
I'm happy with this community
of students that have

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.460
come together for this class.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.100
And I think, in part, a
lot of that has happened

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.844
because it's small enough.

00:01:17.844 --> 00:01:20.450
Seeing them pair off to
work on their projects,

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.760
they have really helped
each other a lot.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.060
And certain personalities
have come through that

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.020
were super quiet in class.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.950
Jamie and I were very deliberate
with how we grouped people up

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.430
for their final projects.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.270
It's been hard to balance the
practical skills with context.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.720
I sent out this midpoint survey
to the students yesterday,

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.100
and someone had said
it was really, really

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.520
packed the first week, and all
of a sudden, the pressure's

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.825
been released.

00:01:50.825 --> 00:01:55.170
If I could find a better way
to spread out all that stuff,

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.900
I think it'd be more ideal.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.300
Oh, the other thing
is, thinking about how

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.162
this could be a
scalable experience,

00:02:03.162 --> 00:02:07.540
I can't imagine this class
going over ten people.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.620
And I think the thing
that's been most valuable

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.170
is individual feedback.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.840
And I might have
mentioned this before,

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.755
but you can easily
teach best practices.

00:02:15.755 --> 00:02:17.296
You can easily talk
about techniques.

00:02:17.296 --> 00:02:19.600
You can even show the examples.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.310
You can go from
concept to example,

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.280
and people can acknowledge
that and people can

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.310
critique other peoples' work.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.360
But then transferring
it to the final layer

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.020
of being self-aware enough
and self-reflective enough

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.832
to view your work with
that same critical eye,

00:02:35.832 --> 00:02:40.300
and, in some sense, like
being able to cultivate taste

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:46.271
among people is really hard.

00:02:46.271 --> 00:02:48.060
I don't know if I'm
really doing it.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.290
And who am I to say that I have
the best taste in anything?

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.124
A lot of the times questions are
posed, opening with, Is it OK?

00:02:56.124 --> 00:02:57.872
Is it OK if I do this?

00:02:57.872 --> 00:03:00.094
Is it OK if I change this?

00:03:00.094 --> 00:03:04.270
Is it OK if I go
to this location?

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.170
I know that what they're
trying to ask is,

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.720
do you recommend this?

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.920
But it's just, it's
striking the way

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.100
that's so ubiquitously posed.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.420
I don't want the
mentality to be that I

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.095
am sort of the end-all be-all.

00:03:17.095 --> 00:03:20.180
I think, more than anything, I'd
want the self-awareness though.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.540
If someone made a terrible
video, but they could say,

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.350
I think this is bad,
and I think maybe this

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.665
is why, I think that that's
ultimately where we need to be.

00:03:31.665 --> 00:03:35.650
More self-awareness in
science communication.
