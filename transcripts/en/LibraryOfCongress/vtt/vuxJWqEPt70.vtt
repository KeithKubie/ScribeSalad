00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.980
&gt;&gt; Judith Gray: Good afternoon.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.280
I'm Judith Gray.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.240 position:56%
I'm the coordinator of reference for
the American Folklife Center here

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.180
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.450
And I'd like to welcome you
to the latest presentation

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.580
in our ongoing series, the Benjamin
A. Botkin Folklife Lecture Series,

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.100
which has been going on since 2003.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.740
This series allows us to highlight
the work of leading scholars

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.490
in the disciplines of folklore,
ethnomusicology, oral history,

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:56.390 position:56%
cultural anthropology, and
cultural heritage while specifically

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.550
enhancing the collections here
at the American Folklife Center.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.490
For the Center and the Library,

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.390
the Botkin lectures
form an important facet

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.890
of our current acquisitions.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.780
Each lecture is videotaped
and becomes part

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.630
of the permanent collections
of the Center.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.280
In addition, the lectures
are later posted as webcasts

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.890
on the Library's website where
they're available for viewing

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.510
to Internet patrons
throughout the world.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.620
That being said, let me remind you

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.960
at this point it would be a
good idea to turn off cellphones

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.790
and things that might buzz or
do other interesting things

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.610
to be captured permanently
on the record.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.220
So today I have the honor
and the distinct pleasure

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.720
of introducing the distinguished
ethnomusicologist Dr. Mark Slobin,

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.980
who is the Winslow-Kaplan
Professor of Music

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.320
and American Studies
at Wesleyan University.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.180
In the course of his career, Dr.
Slobin has written extensively

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.960
on a variety of subjects,
including Eastern European Jewish

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.770
and klezmer music,
global soundtracks,

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.320
and musical subcultures,
ethnomusicological practice

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.230
and theory, and the
music of Afghanistan

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.640
where he conducted
research beginning in 1967.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.500
He has served as the President of
the Society for Ethnomusicology

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.170
and the Society for Asian Music,

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.370
and as Editor of the
journal "Asian Music."

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.170
He's been the recipient of numerous
prizes, including the Seeger Prize

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.630
from the Society for
Ethnomusicology,

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.150
two ASCAP-Deems Taylor
Awards for his books,

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.200
the Jewish Cultural Achievement
Award for Lifetime Achievement

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.090
from the Foundation for Jewish
Culture, and the curt Leviant Award

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.050
in Yiddish Studies from the
Modern Languages Association.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.160
And in his spare time, during his
45 years as a university professor

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.510
at Wesleyan he has also
trained a significant proportion

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.240
of today's ethnomusicologists, and
I have to say that includes me.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.450
I can only wish all current
graduate students a mentor

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.020
as supportive and as
engaged as Mark.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.820
Thank you very much.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.630
So next month Mark will
be retiring from Wesleyan

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.040
where he was recently honored

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.610
with a day-long conference
celebrating his career

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.900
and many accomplishments.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.630
And despite retiring from
full-time teaching though,

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.340
he shows no signs of slowing down.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.530
And so looking ahead we
hope to see more of him here

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.230
in D.C. He says he hasn't
been invited of late.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.970
He is now, and especially
to the Library of Congress.

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.210
Today, however, he's going to be
looking backward to discuss some

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.260 position:56%
of his earliest musical experiences.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:48.520
And after the lecture he'll be
available for a book signing,

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.610
"Folk Music, A Very
Short Introduction,"

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.540
which will be available for sale
and for his signature right after.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.960 position:56%
So for the moment, please join me in
welcoming Mark Slobin for his talk

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:07.510
on Improvising Musical Metropolis,
Detroit, 1940s to the 1960s.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:13.040
[ Applause ]

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.700
&gt;&gt; Mark Slobin: Thanks, it's great
to be here in these hallowed halls.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.980 position:56%
And as you've heard, I've worked on
many things over a very long career.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.980
And for some reason
because Detroit was so much

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.500
in the news I kept
explaining it to people.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.100
And I said, "Well," I said,
"Nobody understands this place."

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.260
I grew up there, and what would it
be like to study it a little bit

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.210
and see what the music culture was
really like in the city in my day?

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.840
So this is a curious project

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.750
because it's partly a
memoir, but it's not a memoir.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.570
It's also a study of this
city -- the life of a city.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.550
There is no book that is the life

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.330
of an American city's music
in any period of time.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.930
We just don't do that.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.170
So it's an interesting project.

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.840
So I'm going to give you a
certain update on what I'm up to.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.410
And I'm writing the book
now that will be based on.

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.400
What you find out when you
work on so many projects is

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.850
that your mind always
goes the same direction.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.430
So I've always been interested
in small musical systems

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.720
that are embedded within
a larger system,

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.510
of many kinds of things going on,

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.810
and some overarching musical
structure in a society,

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.520
of what I've called micromusic.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.690
So I began to realize
looking at Detroit I was --

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.000
it was really kind of
a micromusic study.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.950
So I'm going to be explaining that.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.200
And cities are extremely
complicated.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:38.000 position:56%
One of the great thinkers on cities,
Henri Lefebvre, French theorist,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.510
says that, "The city unveils
a number of systems hidden

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.830
in the illusion of oneness.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.720
And the city manifests
itself as a group of groups,

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:55.280
which is a situation of plurality,
coexistence, and simultaneity."

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.030
These are what I've
found in the music.

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:58.520
There's a very complex system

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.620
of interactive parts
in this great city.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.230
So the talk is in four parts.

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.130
First I'll frame Detroit as
a city in my day and myself

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.910
as an actor -- as a person there.

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:11.680 position:56%
Then I'll talk about this mainstream

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.100
of micromusical interactivity
within the city.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.050
I've used the word
superculture in my writings

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:21.960
for this overarching structure
that one has, and then subcultures.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:27.140
Then I'll look at some of the
micromusical systems themselves,

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.650
including my own community,
the Jewish community.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.540
And then I'll talk
about some directions

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:37.120
for understanding musical --
urban musical spatiality, okay.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.190
So first, what is Detroit?

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.650
What was it then?

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.630
Detroit grew later and more
explosively than other --

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.640
more than industrial cities
like Chicago and Cleveland.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.840
It outgrew its modest status as
a kind of waterways crossroads

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:58.660 position:56%
and site of small manufacturing,
ovens, typewriters, only after 1910.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.460
Doubled in size by 1920.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.130
Doubled again by 1930.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:05.870
So it's a very late,
very explosive growth.

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:10.630
And it owes it simply to one
factor, the success of Henry Ford

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:14.700
and his rivals in attracting
a huge proletarian workforce

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.010
to create a mass market
for the automobile.

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:20.470
Detroit has been called the
capital of the 20th century

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:23.120
because of the way it
defined modern production

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.330
and modern industrial life.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.700
And somebody says it was in
a state of continuous flux

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:32.040
with as few stagnant moments
and interruptions as possible.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.340
So this is a very dynamic
system I'm looking at,

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.170
not some kind of frozen,
industrial city.

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:39.970
Both the corporate systems
and the governmental systems,

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:43.830
part of this superculture, had to
improvise -- that's my title --

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:47.880
continuously and drastically by
the conditions that they created.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.410
The invention of the automobile

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:52.400
and people using it itself
changed the conditions of life.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.820
The scale of building was
unprecedented, actually.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:59.410
And eventually we get
the first urban freeway

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:01.020
and the first shopping
center in America.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:06.670
And by the 1950s the twin
logics of capitalism and racism,

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:07.970
combined with arrogance

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:11.940
and short-sightedness destroyed
Detroit's economic base,

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:15.050
making it the only American
city to both rise above

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:16.910
and fall below a million
inhabitants.

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:18.750
Okay, the demographic key

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:22.720
to the city was the accelerated
arrival of three supergroups.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.190
Internally they were very diverse,

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:26.370
but musically they
look kind of cohesive.

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:30.060
First, the European immigrants such
as my relatives, until the cutoff

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.440
of mass immigration in 1924.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:37.540
Second -- the largest were 350,000
Polish Americans in this city

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:41.540
that got up to about 2 million.

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:45.290
Second, African Americans from
the South who appeared later

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:47.760
and more intensively to
Detroit than other cities

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.500
as part of the Great Migration.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.530
And third, white Southerners
who streamed in by the hundreds

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:54.810
of thousands, particularly
during the war years

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:57.740
when the population
explodes yet again.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:00.220
These supercultures --
these subcultures, I say,

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:03.710
were also improvising, finding
ways to survive the rigors

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:06.080
of the workplace, manage
their communities,

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.000
create an expressive culture,
especially including music,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.140 position:56%
and get along with other immigrants.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:14.100
Detroit was a pressure cooker, and
the heat was turned on too high.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.820
It exploded in the
great wartime race riot

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:20.670
of 1943, just after I was born.

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:22.780
This was the only American
city to be occupied

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:25.610
by the U.S. Army three times.

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:31.020
I was just three months old
and spent the day -- maybe --

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.410
could we -- do you think
the front lights go down?

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:34.710
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:36.010
&gt;&gt; Mark Slobin: It will
be interesting to see

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:37.860
if the front lights go down.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.210
There I am just before the riot.

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:44.580 position:56%
And we were in Belle Isle, this
beautiful island park of Belle Isle.

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:45.880
How did I get to be there?

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.520
My father was born in Detroit,

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.050
and his mother was born
in New York in 1890.

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:53.890
So on that side I'm
third-generation American-born.

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:56.580
But everybody else came
from Southern Ukraine.

00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:00.760
A few family photos will show
the pathway to America and a kind

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:04.360 position:56%
of assimilation in how I became kind

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.370
of a mixed subcultural
and mainstream person.

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:11.010
So I'll just run through
a few photos here.

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:13.870
This is my father's parents
having their honeymoon.

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:18.340
If you were immigrants in
1910 you go to Niagara Falls

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:21.820
for your honeymoon, even
if it looks like that.

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:25.400
And you see the industrial
smoke from the Nabisco factory,

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.070
and what it means to
be an immigrant.

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:29.370
She was only 19 there.

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:32.160
She looks a great deal older.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.530 position:56%
And here is the -- my mother's side.

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:37.110
That's my mother, the
little girl, in Ukraine.

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:41.740
At the same time, right in the
same -- just a couple years later.

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:45.200
And she got to America.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:50.820
And then my parents' honeymoon is
of course, they're Americans now.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:55.200
And they go see New York and
go to the Statue of Liberty.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.400
Okay, and then there's my growing

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:02.150
up as an American-slash-subcultural
person.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:04.060
So what does this mean?

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:06.480
It means cowboys and Indians.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.240
Okay, so here I am
wearing my cowboy thing,

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.490
and there's my little friend
David Droffler [assumed spelling]

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:13.550
with his headdress.

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:15.940
Okay, this is what it
means to be American, okay,

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:20.450
is to be bouncing off
subcultural issues.

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:25.260
Here I am as a mainstream
person, okay.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.380
This is -- and my mother
is just great.

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:29.750
She wrote, "Superman,
1946," you know,

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:32.000
so I know exactly what
these things are.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.590
So here -- so that's
also mainstream, okay,

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:38.210
popular culture is mainstream.

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:39.900
And then we went to Mexico,

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:43.760
so then I get to be a gringo
and an American tourist.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:47.840
Okay, all coming out of this
immigrant kind of roots.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.280
But this is what America means.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.490
It's a set of stereotypes
and activities that relate

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:57.720
to popular culture
and so forth, okay.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:03.160
Okay, so all right,
we'll go back here.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.370
Right, so I left the
Detroit area for --

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:09.160
from nearby Ann Arbor where I got
my doctorate after I was in --

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.110
I went off to do Afghanistan.

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:14.790
It was just at the same
time as the -- another riot.

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:17.850
So I'm kind of framed by these
rebellions, or uprisings,

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:21.920
or whatever they're
called in 1943 and 1967.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:25.470
Detroit has barely survived
the aftershocks and the decline

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:28.170
of these various explosions,
trying literally, actually,

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:30.020
to crawl out of the rubble,

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:33.640
even as the unconcerned suburbs
thrive very well in the area.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:37.590
It's very hard for me to map
my city onto what I see today,

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.110
but that's another story.

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:41.140
Okay, so we'll get to part two now,

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:44.120
the life of music in
this metropolis.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.900
And here I'm concentrating on
what I've called the superculture,

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:50.250
which in this case is
the educational system --

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:52.630
music education.

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:55.250
Detroit's combination
of dynamic growth

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:58.400
and tense social negotiation
was nowhere more apparent

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:03.160
than in the designed space -- and
Lefebvre talks about designed space

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.660
and lived space -- but public
schools are part of designed space.

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:10.380
High school music showcases the
stability and the turbulence

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.090
of a rapidly-changing city.

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:14.030 position:56%
I'm going to single out two schools.

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:16.680
One is Miller High
where my father taught.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:20.020
He was a school teacher in 1937.

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:22.840
And Cass Tech, my alma mater,

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:26.460
and that of countless important
musicians from Ron Carter

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:29.660
and Diana Ross, through
Geri Allen and Jack White.

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:32.180
All these people went
to Cass Tech, okay.

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:34.100
Its music program is extraordinary.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:36.800
So the overlap and the
distinctions between Miller High

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.060
and Cass Tech give me a really
nice platform for talking

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.140
about a lot of musical issues.

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:44.570
And I have some first-hand
experience as well.

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:49.270 position:56%
So actually you can look at American
literature on public school music.

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:53.420
In 1941, "The WPA Guide
to Michigan" said,

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:56.790
"Pioneer work in public school
music has been important

00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:58.250
to the entire nation."

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:01.150
And then in 1940 a book called,

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:05.040
"High School Music" presents Cass
Tech's curriculum in the survey

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.990
of renowned programs in America.

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:11.020
And here is the ideology,
"Nothing is more significant

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:15.280
of the increasing socialization of
education than the rapid extinction

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:20.170
of instrumental study in
connection with schools.

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:23.570
Playing upon an instrument is not
merely a personal accomplishment

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:26.380
with individual benefits,
but is a social power

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:29.860
which affects many persons in
addition to the performer."

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:31.340
So this is very strong ideology

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:33.770
about the importance
of instrumental music.

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:37.630
At Miller High, this attractive
version of Americanization

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:40.960 position:56%
through music was largely foreclosed
by the Board of Education.

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:44.460
Miller had been a junior high,
was changed to senior in 1933

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:47.460
to accommodate the huge influx
of African American students.

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:49.050
The white parents were notified.

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:51.450
They could move their
children out of the district.

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:53.700
So the school quickly
became all black.

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:55.840
This impacted the music.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.770
There's a wonderful interview
I found in a dissertation

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:02.320
with a music teacher who would have
been a colleague of my father's,

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.620
Ms. Dolman [assumed spelling].

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:08.140
"In 1940," she says, "the
Board removed all the classical

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:09.440
instruments from Miller,

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:12.260
sending them to other schools
whose students' background

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:17.900
and breeding would lend them better
to cultured classical music."

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:22.120
So if you wonder why Milt
Jackson played the vibes instead

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:26.600
of the cello, this might
be -- he went to Miller.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.820
There -- you know, there are
some really precise things here.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.950
Things didn't work out that way due
to the dedication of the teachers

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:36.440
who struggled and succeed in
supporting all these amazing kids

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.740
who were coming through Miller.

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:40.360
"High School Music" says,
"The aim of instrumental study

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:43.950
in schools is principally cultural
and social, and only incidentally

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:45.940
and remotely vocational."

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:48.250
Okay, but Ms. Dolman
says something else.

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:51.930
She says, "Music classes were
business classes for our kids.

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:54.730
They practiced long and hard
to develop their skills,

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:57.330
and that's why Kenneth
Burrell and William Evans" --

00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:58.750
later Yusef Lateef --

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:01.360
"Milton Jackson, and
several others are recognized

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.290
as being the best at
their instruments."

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:06.090
I can't help mentioning my father
actually taught American History

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:10.120
to Kenny Burrell, and probably
many other future Jazz greats,

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:12.030
when he was in Miller.

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:16.610
"Milt Jackson in his dissertation
notes that had he not dropped

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:18.910
out of high school he probably
would have gotten a college music

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:21.560
scholarship like a lot
of his classmates did."

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:26.640
Dolman's eyewitness account is in
this remarkable 1970 dissertation

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:30.440
by [inaudible] Jones, and they
opposed the establishment.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.720
"High School Music" again
says, "America does not have

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.340
that racial solidarity
which favors the development

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:38.140
of peculiar musical idioms.

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.760
While we've discovered interesting
folk music among the Indians

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:44.550
and Negroes and make use of it and
enjoy it, yet it cannot be said

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:49.470 position:56%
that this is typical of the American
people at any period [laughter]."

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:53.410 position:56%
Now Ms. Dolman's response of this
erasure of subcultural tradition was

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:56.650
to help build a model for
success in establishment music.

00:16:56.650 --> 00:17:00.500 position:56%
She tells us that the African
American students couldn't get buses

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:04.020
to go to the competitions,
but they went anyway,

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:06.890
and they would win the
all-city band contests.

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:10.130
"They could read and play all
types of music, even the Mozart

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:12.560
that the bigshots downtown
felt was not akin

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:15.670
to their heritage," she says.

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:17.780
Dolman -- oh, wait.

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:21.240
I have a picture of this
which I'm not showing you.

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:24.050
Okay, so here's Miller High.

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:28.440
And up in Fine Arts here,
Fine Arts, we have --

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.910
woops, get this -- Ms. Dolman here.

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:36.420
And then under Social Studies
we have my father here, okay.

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:37.740
So -- and his friends.

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:42.240
These were all people who came
over to our house all the time.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:45.950
The -- this huge mass of Jewish
school teachers in Detroit.

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:52.500
Dolman also made use of black
resources right in the building.

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.960
She brought in a janitor
to help train her chorus.

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.260
And I presume this is somebody

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:59.260
who probably had church gospel
singing background, or was helpful

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:00.870
with her training courses.

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:03.960
I site her because we
have her testimony.

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:08.190
She's not famous like the great
Luis Cabrera who Yusef Lateef

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:10.500
and Kenny Burrell site
as really important

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.880
in their musical formation, who
was also teaching at Cass Tech.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.640
And I'll bring Cabrera back later.

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:21.170
The supportive music of Miller
High, which only lasts until 1957,

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:24.100
offers a striking compliment
to the general urban trajectory

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:26.740
of Detroit marked by black
neighborhood destruction

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:28.870
for freeways to the
newly-built suburbs,

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:31.810
relocation of housing
projects, and a combination

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:35.680
of heavy-handed policing
and economic neglect.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:39.330
So music shows us that the
superculture systems, however,

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:42.390
are not hegemonic wholes,
but they're partial systems

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:44.830 position:56%
with cracks that offer alternatives.

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:47.710
We should not forget the musical
families like the McKinneys

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:50.570
of Detroit and the Joneses --
and we're talking Thad Jones,

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:54.600
Elvin Jones, that family -- that
nurtured talent outside of school.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.980
The pianist Barry Harris
who was himself to this day,

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:00.660
in his late 80s, an
influential teacher,

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:04.520
as a teenager taught all
the other kids stuff.

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.790
And I asked him, I said,
"What about what you learned

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:08.610
at school in what you learned?"

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:11.930
And he said, "Outside,"
he said, "well,

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:14.250
at school we just learned
stock arrangements."

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:17.460
But as street musicians he
says they picked up the skills

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.200
in the neighborhood and
among these families.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.250
So you have a very complicated kind

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:24.250
of superculture/subculture
relationship going on.

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:27.210
Cass Tech offers a
different model of patronage.

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:30.160
It was the magnet school for
the entire city of Detroit.

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:32.350
There was one gigantic
magnet school.

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:37.050
It was eight stories high,
occupied a huge downtown space.

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:40.070
And it wanted to let kids advance

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:42.310
from every subculture
simultaneously.

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:46.180
By 1926 business leaders
could praise Cass

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:49.670
as "A monumental achievement
of education and architecture

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:51.410
of which any city would be proud."

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:54.700
This included those art programs
that are in high school music.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:59.900
And Cass Tech's own literature
says that they "placed students

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:03.530
in enviable positions
in symphony orchestras,

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:06.240
concert bands, radio
and dance bands."

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.910
So this is teens, '20s, '30s.

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:11.510
As those positions dried
up in the post-war period,

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:14.880
the emphasis shifted to preparing
students to be music teachers,

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:18.160
creating a very constructive
cycle of educational continuity

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.580
that I've been looking at.

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:21.360
Cass Tech's alums readily

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.010
and universally praise the
school's music training.

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:27.370
They, quote, "are affectionate
and loyal to Detroit."

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:29.700
Now one doesn't think Detroit's
a place people are affectionate

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:31.000
and loyal by [laughter].

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.080
It's supposed to be this gritty
city we barely escaped from.

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:37.580
But when you look in music you
get a different storyline, right?

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:41.750
And alongside African American
students, the white students

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:44.090
at Cass Tech were on a jazz trek.

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:47.080
They were recruited straight out
of the classroom in the early '40s,

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.780
so the Tommy Dorsey
and Sam Kenton bands.

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:52.170
Some of these kids
were Polish Americans,

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:54.600
and some went on to
fuel the engine of polka

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:58.410
that energized their huge
population, which I'll get to.

00:20:58.410 --> 00:20:59.740
There's a great history of all this

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:02.430
by a woman named Lori Gomulka
whose father was a big-time

00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:03.730
polka musician.

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:06.210
She quotes this one band leader,
Stan Visniok [assumed spelling],

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:10.180
about Cass Tech, "When I
heard that concert band,

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:12.300
tears just rolled down my eyes.

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:13.920 position:56%
Boy, I'm going to be a part of this.

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:16.150
It just warmed my heart."

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:19.000
Apparently the students would
skip school to hear Tommy Dorsey

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.730
at the nearby Fox Theater.

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:24.510
The music teachers would also turn
up, and take attendance, and stay.

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:29.070
[ Laughter ]

00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:30.790
So this is serious music training.

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:34.240
And then, you know, some of
these kids we would hire.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:37.720
So they could move out to New
York or people could move back

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.540
to their home neighborhoods
out of this.

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:41.410
They were both kind of
viable career options

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:43.740
that Cass Tech made available.

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:47.940
African Americans really
benefitted from this rigorous

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:49.340
yet open-minded curriculum.

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:53.110
Ron Carter -- Ronald Carter,
I have him on the programs,

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:54.540
trained in classical chamber music.

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:56.240
I know people who played
string quartets with him

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.100
on the cello at Cass Tech.

00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:01.240
And this carried on through
the work of Marcus Belgrave

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:06.420
who was brought late in the
game, and who taught Geri Allen.

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:09.460
Geri Allen's most recent album,
"Grand River Crossing" is

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:13.740
about crossing this huge street
in Detroit that I know very well.

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:17.830 position:56%
She says in her album, "At Cass
Tech we didn't just have a few music

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:19.780
classes, we had three
years of intensive training

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:23.700
by master teachers, the Detroit
Artist-in-Residence, for the fields

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:27.360
of the classics, old and modern
jazz, spirituals, and the blues."

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.510
So note the blending of
the kind of superculture

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:32.380
and subcultural musics within this.

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:35.000
Regina Carter is another
Belgrave student.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.280
She combines her subcultural
heritage and school training

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:40.310
on her recent album
"Southern Comfort."

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:42.230
She's really interesting.

00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:44.810
She has pieces that are
written around memories

00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:46.890
of her childhood trips
back to Alabama

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:48.810
from Detroit on family visits.

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:52.060
And she uses '30 field
recordings from nearby

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:56.180
to where we are sitting
in the recording.

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:59.890
So she's combining her Cass Tech
technical, classical training

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:03.050
with the sounds of the
cotton field in this kind

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:06.060
of very interesting way,
which is a very Detroit story.

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:09.040
For other types of
subcultural students who --

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.320
you had to qualify to get to Cass
Tech -- the white Southerners,

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:15.310
the Jews, Italians,
Armenians, Greeks, Serbs,

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:17.230
etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:18.530
The grounding in theory

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:21.730
and the ensembles became a
gateway to different careers.

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:25.270
One of my orchestra-mates was
the cornetist Hachig Kazarian,

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:30.780
who is an absolute icon of Armenian
American music for 50 years.

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:33.730 position:56%
He said he learned more about
mainstream music at Cass than he did

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:36.850
at Julliard, which
he dropped out of.

00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:38.840
He got on this track
by going directly

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:41.910
from school to jobs at ethnic bars.

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:46.210
Another guy in the orchestra,
before my time, Rodney Glusac,

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:50.560
said he started a Serbian band
with two classmates in 1951,

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:54.330
and they broke up in
2009 [laughter].

00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:57.900
So music survives dislocation
and suburbanization

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:00.260
when a subculture knows
what it wants

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:02.020
from its school-trained musicians.

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:04.290
And this is the part of
the story I'm telling.

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:08.330
Education moved these kids off
the path to the assembly line,

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:11.800
though some of them still had
to log time at factories to get

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:14.720
by if the music work dried up.

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.710
And various people
have told me that.

00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:20.920
One said, "Cass saved me from
the Detroit industrial ghetto."

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:25.720 position:56%
Like [inaudible], an African
American violinist, was the only one

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:29.250 position:56%
in the orchestra, and the first one
in some major orchestras in America,

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:32.320
and he was glad to leave an
industrial future for a position

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.130
in a major symphony orchestra.

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:38.960
Most of these kids were immigrants
from Europe or the American South.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:43.370
The renowned violinist
sisters Ida and Ani Kavafian,

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:48.180
standbys at Lincoln Center
music, were born in Istanbul.

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:50.080
My successful buddies Daryl

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:52.750 position:56%
and Robert Barnes [assumed spelling]
actually came from Kentucky.

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:56.360 position:56%
And against the hillbilly stereotype
that you might have, their mother,

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:59.310
who was from Lexington, was a
professional French horn player

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:01.990
who was in the Detroit
symphony when she had to quit

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:04.230
because she couldn't be a mom
and a professional in those days.

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:06.960
And both those boys ended up
in the Philadelphia Orchestra

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.390
and the Boston Symphony,
coming from Kentucky.

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:14.730
Okay, so this nexus, this
convergence that happened say

00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:18.320
in classical music is something
that really, really interests me.

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:24.750 position:56%
And my friend Rita Sloan [assumed
spelling] that I knew very well came

00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:29.240
as a refugee after the war, from
displaced person camps to Detroit.

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:33.770
Her family decided they had to have
a piano, and gave it its own room

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:36.590 position:56%
in their house, so she had to double
up with her sister [laughter].

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:40.110
So this is the kind of
value systems that were --

00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:42.750
came with families that I'm
also very interested in.

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:44.950
Okay, so now that brings
me to part three,

00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:47.610
more on the actual
internal subcultural space

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:49.540
of these communities.

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:52.940
So there are three books
that actually help me on it,

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:55.040
because there is no literature
on the city of Detroit to read.

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:59.330
I mean, anything about the city of
Detroit, sociology, urban history,

00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:02.300
there's like fewer than this
many books that are worth reading

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:03.600
about the city of Detroit.

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.850
Such a major place,
it's just unbelievable.

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:09.580
And on music, fortunately in
recent years three books came out.

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:13.500
One was called, "Before Motown,"
which is the history of jazz

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.730
in Detroit, "Before
Motown," very, very helpful.

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:19.720
There's one this -- Lori's
book on Polish American music,

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.550
and one called "Detroit
Country Music"

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:22.980
on the white Southern community.

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:25.760
So this makes it possible for me
to do a little work that I'll lay

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:27.940
out for you and make some maps.

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:32.220
I had some GIS maps
made by students.

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:37.020
And this is just I'm -- they're
not like statistically viable,

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:39.420
but these books are
done by enthusiasts

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:41.410
who tell you what club
everybody played in,

00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:42.710
and where the addresses were.

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:44.010
I love books like this.

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:47.950
And then you can actually use
them to construct some kind

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:49.770
of geographic spatial sense.

00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:53.470
So I'll give you a
little bit of this.

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:58.360
This is a map that combines
Polish versus country music.

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:01.620
And you can see that the country
music is more the star-shaped

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:04.380
things, and the Polish
music is more concentrated.

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:07.310
And country music is
all over the city

00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:10.110
because there was this huge
scattered population where somebody

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:13.360
like the Poles who were
basically in their enclave

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:17.190
of this city-within-a-city called
Hamtramck, but they overlap

00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:19.220
in the downtown spaces,
which are the clubs,

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:21.640
the radio studios,
recording studios.

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:26.430
So you can see that in this kind
of just spread of those maps.

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:30.000
You know, to the extent
you can map this properly.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.930
Here's another one
that I was able to get

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:33.860
out of this book, country music.

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:37.630
Where were these born,
and where did they play?

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:41.130
And you can see they're all
born in the absolute heartland

00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:44.800
of what would be country music,
you know, with a few exceptions.

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.910
Mostly Kentucky, Tennessee,
West Virginia.

00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:50.480
And then you can see
where they traveled.

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:52.810
And just like in Detroit,
these people are traveling all

00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:57.510
over the country, as are the Serb
musicians and the Polish musicians,

00:27:57.510 --> 00:27:58.810
because there's networks.

00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:00.610
So every group has its network.

00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:05.160 position:56%
The -- of course, the white Southern
music networks probably more last

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:07.180
than some of these ethnic
networks which wouldn't have

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:09.950
as many different spots
on the circuits, right.

00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:13.620
So I'm only going to play little
tiny bit of music in this talk

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:15.520
because I'm doing so
many other things.

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:17.370
But I'll give you two
subcultural examples

00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:19.410
that are very, very indicative.

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:22.630
The first is from the African
American music community,

00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:27.010
which was centered for [inaudible]
generation on Hastings Street.

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:29.170
And actually my father
lived on Hastings Street

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:32.770
when he was a small child, before
this wave of the Great Migration.

00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:34.200
There was a Jewish
neighborhood there.

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:37.790
So I know about Hastings Street.

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:41.910
And there is a song by a
guy named Detroit Count.

00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:43.210
His real name was Robert White.

00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:44.760
He came from Chattanooga.

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:47.790
And he did a song called
"Hastings Street Opera."

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:52.350
I have to credit Dick Spotswood
for finding me this, of course.

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:57.220
And "Hastings Street Opera" is this
piece where he lists every bar --

00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:00.860
it's two sides of a 78, and he
runs out before he [laughter] --

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:03.960 position:56%
Yusef Lateef said, "Not even Detroit
Count could have covered all the

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:05.260
places there were."

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:06.620
That's how many joints there were.

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:08.080
So I'll give you just a
little flavor of that.

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:10.120
It's hard to understand
him, of course.

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:12.640
But let's see, okay.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.940
I'll get to this.

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:15.240
Oops, no, no, no, no.

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.540
Go back, go back.

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:20.290
All right, here we go.

00:29:26.510 --> 00:30:19.080
[ Music ]

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:24.120
This is on YouTube, so I urge
you to listen to the rest of it.

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:29.460
That's an amazing piece of music,
and it's deep Detroit, okay.

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:32.290 position:56%
The second little example of -- it
comes from the Southern white world.

00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:35.850
This is 1939, but it talks on
inter-subcultural relations,

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:38.310
which in Detroit, you
know, would lead to riots.

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:43.210 position:56%
But the so-called hillbillies, the
white Southerners, did not get along

00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:47.430
with the older Catholic
European populations, the Poles

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:51.480
and these Appalachian people
did not get along at all.

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:54.380
The most famous country
group that lived in and out

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:56.100
of Detroit was the York Brothers,

00:30:56.100 --> 00:31:00.400
and they came out with a
song called "Hamtramck Mama."

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:03.250
No I showed you Hamtramck on
the map as this, you know,

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:05.610
fortress of Polish culture.

00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:09.700
So here is the York
Brothers' referencing of --

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:11.930
no, no, no, no [laughter].

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:14.560
Why is this thing so twitchy?

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.860
All right.

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:20.620
You're going to play this, right?

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:22.510
Oh, I turned down the sound.

00:31:22.510 --> 00:32:18.300
[ Music ]

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:23.440
The Mayor of Hamtramck tried to get
it banned from airplay [laughter].

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:26.370
It was not a happy situation.

00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:29.510
So this gives you some sense
of the subcultural activity,

00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:33.980
and I'm going to talk a little bit
about my own subcultural space.

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:38.060
My group positioned
itself on the frontier,

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:41.840
the border between superculture
and subculture very deliberately.

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:45.000
The Jews turned inward
musically in their own practices,

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.400
and I'll talk about that.

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:49.770
But they also pushed resolutely
outward into the mainstream

00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:53.120
as a part of a generalized policy.

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:56.860
The Jews encapsulate the anxieties
and achievements in minority agency

00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:59.230
in ways that differ from
these other activities

00:32:59.230 --> 00:33:01.590
of all these other groups
I've been mentioning.

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:06.310
The community mushroomed in the
1910s, jumping in a few years

00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:09.730
from 10,000 to 50,000, including
my grandfather and great-uncles,

00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:11.440
and peaked at around 90,000.

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:15.020
So it was a pretty large
minority within Detroit.

00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:16.660
They were all in a
single neighborhood,

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:20.190
and they were deeply divided
on all kinds of lines.

00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:24.000
One scholar says, "Different voices
seem to cry out in disharmony

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.400
for resolutions to a confusing
mixture of problems and questions,"

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:28.980
about the Jewish community.

00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:31.210
And I think anybody who
knows a Jewish community,

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:32.510
this pretty much right.

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:35.110
So I can talk about
two little trends.

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:38.050
One is the extroverted
tendency to push outward

00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:41.080
in classical music
cosmopolitanism and the kind

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:44.590
of interior religious practice.

00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:47.470
The newly-emancipated
Jews of Europe,

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:51.230
starting around 1800 used
European classical music as a way

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:55.340
to join the mainstream in ways that
are strategic but also deeply-felt.

00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:57.460 position:56%
You think of Mendelssohn and Mahler.

00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:59.860
But also all the orchestra
members and the audience

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:03.920
that supported classical music
in Berlin, and Vienna, Odessa,

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.450
Kiev, Warsaw, every city.

00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:07.910
And there is no book on
this, which is amazing.

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:09.230
There's no book about that.

00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:13.750
I started violin lessons
at the age of four, right.

00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:15.470
&gt;&gt; Aww!

00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:18.340
&gt;&gt; Mark Slobin: And I
had already been to --

00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:19.970
I asked, "I want to
play the violin,"

00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:21.760
because I already had
seen Jascha Heifetz

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:23.490
and Mischa Elman at this age.

00:34:23.490 --> 00:34:26.670
Here I am on my way
to my first lesson.

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:36.290
Let's see, here's my first concert
-- first -- this is in high school.

00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:38.850
Then at Cass Tech, right?

00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:40.150
Yeah, okay, now we go back.

00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:42.270
And that is the interior world.

00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:45.820
Okay, my parents' social circle
gathered at the orchestra concerts,

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:49.590
and the Jewish community kept the
Detroit Symphony Orchestra alive

00:34:49.590 --> 00:34:51.090
when the flickering interest

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:54.230
of the city's auto moguls
endangered the organization.

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:55.820
They came to this late.

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:57.120
It's Detroit.

00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:58.420
It's not Chicago and
Cleveland, you know.

00:34:58.420 --> 00:34:59.720
There was no orchestra hall.

00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:01.020
They -- I mean, that's
another story.

00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:02.890
If I had time I would tell
you, which is very amusing.

00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:05.670
And they get this, but they
like pull their money out of it.

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:07.200
So the Jews wanted it to happen.

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:10.740
A couple of people, including
two of my violin teachers,

00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:12.320
organized a chamber symphony --

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:15.370
a chamber orchestra
called the Little Symphony

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:16.670
that kept things running.

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:20.440
They gave concerts at an
upscale Jewish restaurant

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:22.280
when there was no Detroit Symphony.

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:26.760
At another time a guy called
Sams Cutright kept sponsorship

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:28.060
of the symphony going.

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:32.430
Community ladies had organized
the Music Study Club in the 1920s,

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:35.210
which paralleled the
non-Jewish Tuesday Musicale

00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:36.990
that went back to the 1880s.

00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:38.290
And I was in that crowd.

00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:40.100
We played at Music
Study Club gatherings,

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:42.890
and they gave scholarships
for child prodigies

00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:45.460
who went off to have big careers.

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:49.310
One of the interesting moments was
the decision to hire a classical --

00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:52.450
a Jewish composer from Vienna
named Julius [inaudible]

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:56.370
who was charged with, in 1940,

00:35:56.370 --> 00:35:59.000
to organize a professional-level
orchestra and a music school

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.570
at the Jewish Community
Center, which was very linked

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:03.200
to Detroit Symphony Orchestra.

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:07.280
So there's this parallel
establishment and integration

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:11.370
of the Jewish community with the
mainstream community at this level.

00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:15.460 position:56%
He's also bringing in -- he had
lived in Palestine, so he's bringing

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:19.380
in Palestine sound and Zionist
things in his own compositions.

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:22.670 position:56%
He gets the Detroit Symphony
Orchestra to do a Jewish Music Week.

00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:23.970
Very complicated.

00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:25.270
They're playing in black churches.

00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:26.900
There's a lot of outreach.

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:28.830
He couldn't control everything.

00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:31.830
As I was looking through the
newspaper, the Detroit Jewish News,

00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:35.770
1942, [inaudible] is giving a
concert with a black church.

00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:37.470
And on the same page it's announced

00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:41.850
that the Jewish Center cub pack
will be putting on a minstrel show.

00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:44.920
So [laughter] it's a
rather complicated set

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:50.300
of relationships say in 1942.

00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:54.000
So this epitomizes the
dynamism, the complexity

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.600
of American Jewish musical life
that look both outward and inward

00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:01.090
in a turbulent century that saw
the restriction of immigration,

00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:03.380
the Holocaust, establishment
of the State of Israel.

00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:07.420
But Detroit was the most
anti-Semitic city in America.

00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:12.060
Henry Ford funded vicious
propaganda, and the publication

00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:15.420
of the elders -- protocol
of the Elders of Zion.

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:17.650
The radio priest Father
Coughlin was [inaudible]

00:37:17.650 --> 00:37:21.110
against the Jews every week
to millions across America.

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:24.640
Three was a plot by the
Michigan Black Legion

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:27.620
to murder a million Jews by
planting bombs in every synagogue

00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:29.850
across America on Yom Kippur.

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:32.650
Okay, so I'm learning what
my parents were living

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:37.350
through in this city
in their cultural life.

00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:39.980
But they also kept their
traditional channels

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:41.680
of music, and that was that photo.

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:45.730
Here I am, my father's teaching me
how to do my bar mitzvah chanting.

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:49.790
And I had a really
interesting experience

00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:51.540
of a grad student named
Garrett Field,

00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:53.460
who was a specialist
in South Asian music.

00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:56.700
And he said, "I want to do a
paper on" -- I said, "On what?"

00:37:56.700 --> 00:38:00.050
He said, "I want to talk about this
synagogue boys' choir I was in."

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:02.560
I said -- I had no idea
he was even Jewish.

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:03.860
I said, "Where was that?"

00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:05.160
And he said, "Detroit."

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:06.460
I said, "What synagogue?"

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:09.330
He said, "B'nai Moshe," which
is where I was bar mitzvah.

00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:11.640 position:56%
And I said, "Sure," you know, right.

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:15.030
So he and his brother
were deeply affected

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:18.070
by the Cantor there
named Cantor Louis Klein.

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:19.540
One of my [inaudible]
was the history

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:21.710
of the American Cantorate
that I did.

00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:23.580
And Louis Klein actually
was a contributor

00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:25.490
to that project, so
I knew who he was.

00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:26.790
He was another immigrant.

00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:29.380
He grew up in Romania.

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:31.570
He came by Belgium and London.

00:38:31.570 --> 00:38:35.680
And in Detroit he sang,
you know, on Radio and TV.

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.760
He'd concert at Catholic retreats.

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:39.730
He was another one
of these immigrants

00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:41.860
like [inaudible] who
he was musicality.

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:46.500
But he's using it in the system
of ancient Hebrew sacred music.

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:50.310
So I'll read you two little
quotes from the Field brothers

00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:53.780
about the experience
of being in the choir.

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:57.280
"As a young boy raised in a
conservative Jewish family,

00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:00.480
I could sense the High
Holidays just around the corner.

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:02.800
The air became cooler, and
the leaves began to color.

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:05.990
Soon I would be on the bimah,"
the platform of the synagogue,

00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:09.760
"with my boys' choir cohorts,
circled around the [speaking

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:12.210
in foreign language] on the table
on which the Torah scroll sits,

00:39:12.210 --> 00:39:15.020
accompanied by the
hazzan Louis Klein."

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:17.040
The other one says, "I
remember the excitement

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:19.820
and nervousness before
heading onstage when we sat

00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:23.790
with our families, like secretive
spies with alternate identities.

00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:27.120
One second the humble and
anonymous son of the Field family,

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:30.650
and a minute later, zam!, a
regular mini-Cantor belting

00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:33.590
out sonorous renditions of
traditional Jewish songs

00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:35.920
for the audience of
fellow congregants.

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:38.330
We had done something great,
and exciting, and memorable.

00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:41.540
It was like a secret proud
friendship and comradeship."

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:43.520
So this is a really
wonderful statement

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:46.960
about an internal subcultural life
at the same time that they're doing

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:49.240
as much outreach as they can.

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:52.600 position:56%
So I'm going to close here with part
four here, some little reflections

00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:56.790
on the notion of urban spatiality
and music, and the relationships

00:39:56.790 --> 00:40:00.760
of all these, because I'm, you
know, mapping out this vast area,

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:05.470
and I'm trying to find some
kinds of ways of doing that.

00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:08.720
Before the Internet,
then, a large urban area

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:12.020
like Detroit was a fairly bounded
system, even if it was plugged

00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:18.880 position:56%
into like national and international
circuits of family and marketing.

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:21.810
And Lefebvre talks about
the imagined space,

00:40:21.810 --> 00:40:24.010
which is the imagined
idea of the city,

00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:26.170
the designed space,
and the lived space.

00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:29.220
And this plurality
co-existence and simultaneity.

00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:31.560
Music operates among
all these world.

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:34.260
It's -- it flows into
all kinds of channels.

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:38.900
So I'm just going to give you two
little moments that suggest the --

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:43.090
what I find the interesting
issues around some of this,

00:40:43.090 --> 00:40:45.340
using Yusef Lateef, who was one

00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:47.920
of the most influential
musical Detroiters.

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:51.840
In the mid-'50s, Lateef was
drawn to Islam at a time

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:55.510
when he was also trying to expand
the instruments he could play.

00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:57.730
He was tired of the
standard jazz instruments.

00:40:57.730 --> 00:41:01.100
He picked up the rebab
the North African fiddle.

00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:03.950
So you would say, "Well,
he went into Islam.

00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:06.970
He found this North African fiddle
because of Islamic connections.

00:41:06.970 --> 00:41:08.580
And he was" -- but no.

00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:11.040
It was an Arab American
coworker on the line

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:13.840
at the Chrysler factory, okay.

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:17.450
Now this is a real Detroit story,
then speaking of the comradery

00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:20.450
of the polyglot workforce
of the auto industry.

00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:22.400
For Lateef the rebab was different

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:26.020
from what I'm calling
inherently-available resources

00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:27.320
he had.

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:28.770
This is what you grow up with
and what you have available,

00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:31.570
what you have in the family,
and what you get in school.

00:41:31.570 --> 00:41:34.340
These are things that are
inherently available to you.

00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:36.090
But then there are other things

00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:38.950
which I'm calling adjacent
resources.

00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:42.300
The factory allowed for
the nearness of a music

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:46.970 position:56%
that might have been the third
category, my inaccessible resources.

00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:48.370
So there are adjacent resources --

00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:52.180
inherent ones, adjacent ones that
are around there that you might run

00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:53.710
into and use, and ones that are

00:41:53.710 --> 00:41:57.030
for whatever reason simply
not accessible to you at all,

00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:58.790
physically or conceptually.

00:41:58.790 --> 00:42:03.270
This reminds me -- his experience
reminds me in a passage in a poem

00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:07.190
by Philip Levine, which was the
great American poet from Detroit.

00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:09.630
And I'm using poetry, and
literature, and other things

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:12.360
to try to flesh this out.

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:15.980
He happened to have to work on
the assembly line a little bit,

00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:19.780
and he writes about, "My
friend Marion, the ex-junkie

00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:25.050 position:56%
and novice drop-forge worker, off
by himself, humming "Body and Soul."

00:42:25.050 --> 00:42:27.720
He played with Hawkins
before his troubles,

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:31.250
and now has four 10-inch
bluebirds left to prove it."

00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:34.640
Hawkins here is Coleman
Hawkins, a major figure.

00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:37.020
And the bluebirds are these
records that you've got over here.

00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:38.800
It's a famous jazz record label.

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:42.490
So the adjacency of the workplace
gives Philip Levine access

00:42:42.490 --> 00:42:45.730
to a friend of his who used
to play with Coleman Hawkins.

00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:48.480
So it's something like
that Lateef story.

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:53.110
The second one is about me
and Lateef in a funny way.

00:42:53.110 --> 00:42:57.790
At the end of the '50s I used to
clutch my violin case at 6:45 a.m.

00:42:57.790 --> 00:43:01.430
on a cold corner to catch the
Dexter bus down to Cass Tech

00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:03.500
to get there for orchestra
rehearsal.

00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:06.100
After white flight I was
living in a neighborhood

00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:09.370
that by then had only
7% of Detroit's Jews,

00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:11.700
and everybody else
was African American.

00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:16.410
And I would see this club with
a glass front you looked in.

00:43:16.410 --> 00:43:18.060
It was called the Minor Key.

00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:19.580
And there would be
hand-lettered signs

00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:21.990
in the window saying
Yusef Lateef, you know,

00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:23.290
John Coltrane, or whatever.

00:43:23.290 --> 00:43:25.660
And in fact, I've checked.

00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:27.650
Yes, Lateef played
the Minor Key then,

00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:30.770
exactly when I would
have been standing there.

00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:34.100
Because -- so this was
adjacent physically to me,

00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:37.000
but the Minor Key was not
available to me conceptually

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.770
because I had all this
inherently-available music starting

00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:45.380
with Russian songs, Gilbert and
Sullivan, many things that I had

00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:49.110
in classical music which were
physically extremely far away,

00:43:49.110 --> 00:43:52.040
but conceptually inherent
and close to me.

00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:53.850
But here was this thing
that was physically close

00:43:53.850 --> 00:43:55.570
which was conceptually distant.

00:43:55.570 --> 00:43:58.260
It never occurred to me to
step inside to hear the music,

00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:00.460
so I missed all of the
Golden Age of jazz.

00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:01.940
And I know other kids --

00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:04.340
I've mentioned this to kids
that went to school with me.

00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:05.990
And they said, "Oh, we just to
be in the Minor Key all the time

00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:09.420
because they -- Kenny, the son
of the manager was this kid

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:11.460
in our high school, this
Jewish kid, and you know,

00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:13.500
we used to go to the Minor Key."

00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:19.150
Really? So -- and there was this
other guy I talked to, he said he

00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:22.170
and his buddy used to
walk into bluegrass clubs

00:44:22.170 --> 00:44:25.160
because they were tired of what
they learned from like Pete Seeger

00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:27.550 position:56%
from guitar and banjo, and they
wanted to hear what the real people,

00:44:27.550 --> 00:44:29.000
how they played those instruments.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.100
And I would never do this.

00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:34.940
So they -- this is a more
aggressive notion of adjacency

00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:37.870
than I somehow could muster up.

00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:40.770
And finally kids introduced me to
jazz, but I couldn't understand why

00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:43.090
on the wall of Cass Tech
it said "Bird Lives!"

00:44:43.090 --> 00:44:44.780
I had no idea what this meant.

00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:49.380 position:56%
Charlie Parker had just died then,
and you know, I said, "What's that?"

00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:52.370
you know. Okay, but I began
to get into jazz, right.

00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:57.290
But if you look back farther
it turns out that Cabrera,

00:44:57.290 --> 00:45:01.900
the great teacher of Lateef and
I, actually shared a program.

00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:04.310
So here's my mother's
thing, Mark's first concert.

00:45:04.310 --> 00:45:05.610
No, that's where I am going

00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:08.460
to my first concert you
can see I'm nervous, right?

00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:12.610
Let's see, here's the program.

00:45:12.610 --> 00:45:14.170
Mark's first concert.

00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:17.300
You'll see that the -- I'm in
the all-city junior orchestra,

00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:20.490
but you'll also see that the
-- there's something conducted

00:45:20.490 --> 00:45:23.290
and arranged by Luis
Cabrera on the same program.

00:45:23.290 --> 00:45:25.980
So I actually kind
of shared this space,

00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:28.580
which was then not
a conceptual space;

00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:31.330
it was a physical space, okay.

00:45:31.330 --> 00:45:34.460
And then one more anecdote of
this, and then I'll wrap up.

00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:35.850
At an early convention of Society

00:45:35.850 --> 00:45:40.110
for Ethnomusicology I met a young
African American ethnomusicologist

00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:41.410
named Sylvia Kinney.

00:45:41.410 --> 00:45:43.000
Turned out she was a Detroiter.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.350
She lived two blocks away from me,
and she loved the music in Detroit

00:45:46.350 --> 00:45:49.110
and talked about the great
Emancipation Day concerts,

00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:52.780
which I had never heard of
and never would have gone to.

00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:56.610
That is what I would call an
inaccessible resource to me,

00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:59.650
even though for her it was
something really important

00:45:59.650 --> 00:46:00.950
that happened every year.

00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:02.830
Okay, so -- and of course,

00:46:02.830 --> 00:46:07.610
many African Americans had many
experiences with inaccessibility

00:46:07.610 --> 00:46:10.140
because of conditions
of American life,

00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:12.320
including in the musical realm.

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:14.730
So that's part of this complexity.

00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:17.370
So cities offer conceptual spaces

00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:19.700
and concrete sites,
but not neutrally.

00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:22.680
It's not just the designed
city of the street grid.

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:25.260
In Detroit all the players,
individuals, groups,

00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:28.230
the establishment, created and
pushed the limits of availability,

00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:30.750
physically and imaginatively.

00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:34.800
Music could be heard or
unheard, mandated or without,

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:36.650
like the instruments from Miller,

00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:40.690
according to largely unwritten
rules of improvisation.

00:46:40.690 --> 00:46:43.240
Collaboration and separation
coexisted

00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:46.790
in a constantly-shifting
landscape within a community,

00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:49.650 position:56%
between neighborhoods, and citywide.

00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:52.830
And Detroit is, of course,
famous for its mobility, created

00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:56.620
and promoted by a capitalist
drive that people had to work

00:46:56.620 --> 00:46:59.730
around with -- work
with or work around.

00:46:59.730 --> 00:47:02.660
Many of these forms are still
around in Greater Detroit,

00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:06.460
at least 20 miles from where
they started, but ethnic --

00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:11.640
older ethnic genres have declined.

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:15.940
And if you can't hear
musicians except at festivals

00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:18.530
or shared venues, you can't
exchange things the way you could

00:47:18.530 --> 00:47:22.510
in the 1940s when my friend the
great American composer Gordon

00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:23.810
[inaudible] grew up around.

00:47:23.810 --> 00:47:26.420
He used to take the bus downtown
from his white high school

00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:28.540
in the suburbs to listen
to the music in the city.

00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:31.670
Nobody does that in
Detroit today, okay.

00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:34.510
Mass transit allowed for
adjacency, and there was less fear.

00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:38.150 position:56%
I'm not saying it was a better
musical model, because one of the --

00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:41.300
I almost didn't start this project
because I'm fighting nostalgia,

00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:42.960
and I didn't want to get into that.

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:45.100
But I'm trying to show the richness

00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:49.380
of exploring the inner musical
workings of an American city not

00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:52.670
yet exploded by white flight
and the triumph of the freeway.

00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:55.590
The last phase of the
dominance of the Northeast

00:47:55.590 --> 00:47:58.830
of an almost desperate style of
social and industrial engineering

00:47:58.830 --> 00:48:01.890
and intense, close-up
interaction of an older collection

00:48:01.890 --> 00:48:05.710
of American subcultures
with modernity.

00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:09.490
It's a good site for spatiality
studies because it's so tight.

00:48:09.490 --> 00:48:13.090
It's 1910, and by 1970 it's over.

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:16.020
When Detroit was a byword
for power, not ruin.

00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:20.050
And for their manic musical
momentum that we all know

00:48:20.050 --> 00:48:22.270
of because we all hear
Motown songs like every day.

00:48:22.270 --> 00:48:25.520
So we were the first to
see the new model cars

00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:28.120
and hear the just-released
future hit songs.

00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:31.640
It seems I was lucky to grow up
there, and I'm looking forward to,

00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:33.580
you know, continuing this research.

00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:35.510
Thanks.

take some questions.

any questions about all this.

00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:53.770
&gt;&gt; Hello, Professor.

Thank you again for -- my

[Inaudible] interesting and poignant
talk [inaudible] I'm a lifelong

00:49:02.530 --> 00:49:04.690
Washingtonian, so I actually
[inaudible] resident,

00:49:04.690 --> 00:49:06.290
I mean, I sensed that.

00:49:06.290 --> 00:49:07.990
It's kind of, for lack
of a better phrase,

00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:10.070
crossover, and sort of mix --

00:49:10.070 --> 00:49:11.370
&gt;&gt; Mark Slobin: Yeah,
that's very American.

00:49:11.370 --> 00:49:14.330
&gt;&gt; Yes. As someone who's 47 now,

00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:16.300
I [inaudible] like the friend
you described toward the end,

00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:18.620
the kid who took the bus downtown.

terms of like where I grew

00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:24.250
up in [inaudible] Maryland,
so I would take the subway,

00:49:24.250 --> 00:49:26.510
or I would bike down to
the mall and so forth.

00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:30.740 position:56%
And my parents are like yours,
immigrants, you know, from Columbia.

00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:32.190
But I never -- I didn't really --

00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:33.990
I know [inaudible] consciously
of my immigrant status,

00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:37.380
but it wasn't something I took upon
as a [inaudible] I was [inaudible]

00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:40.940
because in some ways I gave
me a bit of an outside --

00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:43.250
not outsider, but more
like an objective opinion

00:49:43.250 --> 00:49:45.550
about like how past
history, but also [inaudible]

00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:49.010
to explore [inaudible] how
I feel about certain things.

00:49:49.010 --> 00:49:51.010
And that [inaudible] your talk.

00:49:51.010 --> 00:49:53.560
Here in D.C. it's also
[inaudible] the idea

00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:55.780
of Go-Go music, for example.

00:49:55.780 --> 00:50:00.860 position:56%
Really [inaudible] D.C. that would
not be quite necessarily known about

00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:05.420
or exposed about people who
would necessarily know about it.

00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:06.720
Look at [inaudible] that --

00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:08.480
&gt;&gt; Mark Slobin: Right, so
these things that are not known

00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:10.590
or not available, and other
things that -- it just -- yeah.

00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:12.210
&gt;&gt; It may seem -- you
know, [inaudible] racial.

00:50:12.210 --> 00:50:15.820 position:56%
I was trying to [inaudible] comment,
but sometimes it's just simply --

00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:17.790 position:56%
I joke about Robert DeNiro once said

00:50:17.790 --> 00:50:20.260
that if you don't --
"If you go, you'll know.

00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:21.560
If you don't go, you don't know.

00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:22.860
If you don't know, you don't know."

00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:24.160
I mean, literally you go
somewhere, you'll find out.

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:27.120
You don't go, well, you stay home
and read about it, but you know.

00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:28.540
I'll stop there I just
wanted say that.

00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:29.840
For the sake of brevity
I'll stop there.

00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:31.140
&gt;&gt; Mark Slobin: Sure, sure.

00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:32.440
Yeah, no, no.

00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:33.740
That's interesting.

00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:35.040
Every city has its history,

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:36.340
and we just don't have
these histories, you know.

00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:38.090
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] I'm
from Detroit myself.

00:50:38.090 --> 00:50:39.390
&gt;&gt; Mark Slobin: Oh, wow.

00:50:39.390 --> 00:50:41.720
&gt;&gt; And I remember going down
to Baker's Keyboard Lounge.

00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:43.020
&gt;&gt; Mark Slobin: Right.

00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:47.190
&gt;&gt; -- down to Cass Corridor,
all those bars down there.

00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:50.310
And I also lived in
Hamtown for several years.

00:50:50.310 --> 00:50:51.610
&gt;&gt; Mark Slobin: Okay, right.

00:50:51.610 --> 00:50:53.610
Well, it was this amazing
musical city.

00:50:53.610 --> 00:50:56.500
&gt;&gt; Can you talk a little
bit about radio?

00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:58.190
And did radio have impact?

00:50:58.190 --> 00:50:59.490
Or how did --

00:50:59.490 --> 00:51:00.790
&gt;&gt; Mark Slobin: There
actually is a book.

00:51:00.790 --> 00:51:02.940
The one -- the only other book
there is is called "Rocking

00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:04.240
Down the Dial," and it's one

00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:06.260
of these enthusiast
histories of radio in Detroit.

00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:08.610
So I actually know
something about that,

00:51:08.610 --> 00:51:11.500
because otherwise how do you
find these histories in America?

00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:16.160 position:56%
Nobody keeps archivals of radios and
what happens on the radio, you know.

00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:18.970
And everybody throws out the tapes,
and the recordings, and you know.

00:51:18.970 --> 00:51:20.270
So this guy actually did this.

00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:23.320
He went through all these
stations, and what they did,

00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:26.970
and when they restricted
having R and B

00:51:26.970 --> 00:51:29.000
and wouldn't possibly have
it on, and when they realized

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.720
that there was a big market for
this among kinds of black youth,

00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:34.480
and that they would -- it's like,

00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:36.090
"Yeah we ought to be
putting this on."

00:51:36.090 --> 00:51:38.980
And then there's this amazing
African American woman disk jockey

00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:40.900
who was influential.

00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:42.800
And but one of the --

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:44.200
&gt;&gt; Martha Jean the Queen!

00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:47.130
&gt;&gt; Mark Slobin: Exactly,
Martha Jean the Queen, right.

00:51:47.130 --> 00:51:52.710
So it's -- one of the themes
I get from everybody talking

00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:54.600
about Detroit -- and it may
be true of other cities,

00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:56.570
but Detroiters particularly
stress it --

00:51:56.570 --> 00:51:58.800
and it's apparent when
you look in Motown --

00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:00.650
is that it was a city of open ears.

00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:04.270
It was a city where everybody
listened to lots of stuff.

00:52:04.270 --> 00:52:09.390 position:56%
And these DJs -- there was a DJ,
Electrifying Mojo, and he would play

00:52:09.390 --> 00:52:11.230
like [inaudible] and
things like this

00:52:11.230 --> 00:52:13.020
that African American
teenagers would listen

00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:15.140
to because it was that station.

00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:18.330
You know, and German
industrial rock or things.

00:52:18.330 --> 00:52:20.860
And there was the idea that,
"Yeah, yeah, we listened."

00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:22.960
We knew. We heard stuff
from all over.

00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:25.520
Even if you couldn't go to
those clubs or you couldn't play

00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:29.030
in those places or
whatever, you heard it all.

00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:31.690
And radio offered that.

00:52:31.690 --> 00:52:36.000
There was ethnic radio,
although a lot of it got cut.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:37.740
When they realized there
was more money in rock

00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:41.090
and roll they really cut a lot
of ethnic radio, but it survived

00:52:41.090 --> 00:52:44.340
in some ways, as it
did in every city.

00:52:44.340 --> 00:52:46.250
I mean, partly it's the
story of every city.

00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:49.310
But you know, more intense
here because when you get --

00:52:49.310 --> 00:52:53.150
you get like Motown,
right, and this, you know,

00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:58.720
immense kind of energy
of creating an industry.

00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:02.920
The first ever African American,
you know, music industry,

00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:08.080 position:56%
so to speak of, you know, that was
local, where they drew everybody in.

00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:12.500 position:56%
So these violin teachers of mine,
they were the Motown string section.

00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:15.960
And those are stories that
are really interesting.

00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:17.430
And they took jazz.

00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:18.730
They took classical.

00:53:18.730 --> 00:53:24.070
They took everybody, you know,
into the system that they created

00:53:24.070 --> 00:53:26.080
which paralleled as
an industrial system,

00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:29.020
was paralleling the auto
industry very directly.

00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:31.400
That's a real Detroit story.

00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:34.670
And that part of it appeals to me.

00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:37.440
&gt;&gt; There's another
thing that interests me.

00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:39.230
I grew up in Birmingham, and you --

00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:40.530
&gt;&gt; Mark Slobin: Yeah,
yeah, yeah, right.

00:53:40.530 --> 00:53:42.400
&gt;&gt; -- had to take the
Greyhound bus downtown just

00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:45.110
to watch a couple movies or
watch Louis Armstrong onstage.

00:53:45.110 --> 00:53:46.410
&gt;&gt; Mark Slobin: Well, there you go.

00:53:46.410 --> 00:53:49.240
You're another one of
those, right, yeah.

00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:53.120
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] a lot of the clubs,
French, the Flame, a whole bunch --

00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:54.420
&gt;&gt; Mark Slobin: Great, yeah.

00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:55.720
These were the -- yeah, these
were the major -- right.

00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:57.210
&gt;&gt; But you know, one thing
that happened, it seems to me,

00:53:57.210 --> 00:53:59.370 position:56%
that I was told by my friend from --

00:53:59.370 --> 00:54:03.570
67, it was the dividing line
of being able to go to clubs.

00:54:03.570 --> 00:54:08.500
And black friends of my
general economic background,

00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:11.520
they said for them it was not
welcoming to go to the clubs

00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:15.210
that we always used to go
to as a shared experience.

00:54:15.210 --> 00:54:16.510
&gt;&gt; Mark Slobin: Oh, okay.

00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:17.810
&gt;&gt; But the riots --

00:54:17.810 --> 00:54:19.110
&gt;&gt; Mark Slobin: But they weren't
welcome in the white clubs?

00:54:19.110 --> 00:54:20.410
&gt;&gt; There were welcome.

00:54:20.410 --> 00:54:21.710
They didn't feel welcome
in the black clubs.

00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:23.010
&gt;&gt; Mark Slobin: In the black clubs?

00:54:23.010 --> 00:54:24.310
Oh, the white people didn't feel --

00:54:24.310 --> 00:54:26.610
&gt;&gt; No, I'm talking about
black middle-class --

00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:27.910
&gt;&gt; Mark Slobin: Oh, all right.

00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:29.210
&gt;&gt; -- black.

00:54:29.210 --> 00:54:30.510
&gt;&gt; Mark Slobin: I see.

00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:31.810
Yeah.

00:54:31.810 --> 00:54:33.110
&gt;&gt; Felt that they weren't welcome
as much in the black clubs.

00:54:33.110 --> 00:54:37.560
I thought that was a watershed on
some [inaudible] back in a while.

00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:41.080
&gt;&gt; Mark Slobin: Well, there still
are some clubs, but you know,

00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:43.540
I mean, the whole thing was gutted.

00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:44.960
I mean, Hastings Street was the --

00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:48.490
was literally paved over to
create the Chrysler Freeway.

00:54:48.490 --> 00:54:51.140
So they destroyed the entire
culture of this population

00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:52.690
and their music community.

00:54:52.690 --> 00:54:55.780
They literally just did that.

00:54:55.780 --> 00:54:59.410
So you know, that offers
you fewer choices, right?

00:54:59.410 --> 00:55:00.710
&gt;&gt; No question.

00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:02.010
&gt;&gt; Mark Slobin: Yeah?

00:55:02.010 --> 00:55:04.510
&gt;&gt; As a native Kentuckian
I was kind of taken aback

00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:08.520
when you said [inaudible] actually
a French horn player from --

00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:12.100 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mark Slobin: No, because of the
-- right, because of the stereotypes

00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:13.900
&gt;&gt; -- that Kentucky
is all hillbillies.

00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:18.010
You may as well say Michigan
is all industrial ghetto.

00:55:18.010 --> 00:55:19.310
&gt;&gt; Mark Slobin: Yeah, no.

00:55:19.310 --> 00:55:20.610
That's why I used the
example, because it goes

00:55:20.610 --> 00:55:22.860
against these stereotypes
that people have

00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:26.690 position:56%
about who these people were and what
they might have been listening to.

00:55:26.690 --> 00:55:30.450
No, I mean, that's exactly
why I brought that example.

00:55:32.070 --> 00:55:33.490 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Can you tell us a little bit more

00:55:33.490 --> 00:55:37.400
about the ethnic music
like the polka?

00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:43.050
&gt;&gt; Mark Slobin: Yeah, the -- oh,
it's fascinating, this whole world.

00:55:43.050 --> 00:55:46.390
There are different
stories to tell, you know,

00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:51.490
depending on which group it is
and how musically active they were

00:55:51.490 --> 00:55:55.350 position:56%
for their size and scale I mean,
I've been trying to figure that out.

00:55:55.350 --> 00:55:57.740
So I have some stories of
some of the communities.

00:55:57.740 --> 00:56:00.060
And I know -- and some of
them interact with each other.

00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:02.420
Others really kept to themselves.

00:56:02.420 --> 00:56:07.040
The Poles were so massive,
this 350,000 people population

00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:10.420
in this city, that
they didn't need --

00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:12.980
you know, they were really
self-sufficient in a way.

00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:15.530
So it's -- a lot of people
played with Poles, and --

00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:18.640
but they didn't have to
kind of go out that much

00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:19.960
in certain kinds of ways.

00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:23.590
But they benefitted from the
school systems, yeah, and the --

00:56:23.590 --> 00:56:26.910
some of them went off
on this jazz track.

00:56:26.910 --> 00:56:30.470
Where smaller groups, the
Serbs, and the Croats,

00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:34.000
and the Romanians would play
together and share repertoires,

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:38.430
but then you know, later when
you've got the Yugoslavia war,

00:56:38.430 --> 00:56:39.730
this -- that stopped.

00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:44.250
You know, so these diasporic
lives connect to homelands

00:56:44.250 --> 00:56:47.510
and what's going on in other
places in certain ways.

00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:50.280
There were gypsy, roaming
musicians who moved

00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:53.320
around from one thing to another.

00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:57.610
It's complicated, and it's
just really badly researched.

00:56:57.610 --> 00:57:02.120
There's just very little that
I've been able to, you know,

00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:05.730
bring into this to really do
a thorough job, which would --

00:57:05.730 --> 00:57:08.410 position:56%
nobody kept records of these people.

00:57:08.410 --> 00:57:10.850
So you can talk to some of them,
and there's some things to read.

00:57:10.850 --> 00:57:14.200
But -- I mean, some
interviews and things like that.

00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:16.910
But there's not anywhere
the kind of data you'd want

00:57:16.910 --> 00:57:21.220
to have a really serious mapping
of what all those people were

00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:24.310
up to, those communities.

00:57:24.310 --> 00:57:26.070
&gt;&gt; One quick follow-up, 30 seconds.

00:57:26.070 --> 00:57:28.440

But quick example, in the
basement of that bookstore,

00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:46.290
Capital [inaudible]
Used Bookstore --

00:57:46.290 --> 00:57:48.060

00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:56.720

&gt;&gt; Mark Slobin: Well, you asked
me to come up with a book.

00:58:13.010 --> 00:58:15.340
I thought the smallest,
cheapest one, that's --

00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:18.410
that goes with the Folklife
Center would be the one to --

00:58:18.410 --> 00:58:19.710
