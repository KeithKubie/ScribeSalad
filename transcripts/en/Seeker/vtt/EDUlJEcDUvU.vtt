00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.270
Net neutrality suffers
a blow in the courts,

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.630
but is this the end for
free and open internet?

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:10.820
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.770
Hi, this is Annie
filling in for DNews.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:14.450
On Tuesday, a US
Court of Appeals

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.670
ruled against the Federal
Communications Commission

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.670
in a decision that voided
much of the FCC's existing

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.022
net neutrality rules.

00:00:21.022 --> 00:00:22.730
The ruling was the
result of a suit filed

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.420
by Verizon who charged that the
FCC's neutrality rules violated

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.170
their First and Fifth
Amendment rights.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.140
Those rules, which the
FCC put in place in 2010,

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.390
dictate a few things.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.230
Basically ISPs
can't discriminate

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.630
against certain
types of traffic,

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.790
can't block any lawful
content, and should

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.812
be open and transparent
with customers

00:00:39.812 --> 00:00:41.270
with how they manage
their traffic.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.439
But in this decision, the
court rejected those rules

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:45.230
on the grounds that,
quote, "The commission

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.090
failed to establish that the
anti-discrimination and anti

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.580
blocking rules do
not impose, per se,

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.260
common carrier obligations."

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.200
Common carriage
is a legal concept

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.290
that informs the regulation of
traditional telecom companies.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.910
In 2002, though,
the FCC classified

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.560
ISPs as information
services rather than

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.470
telecoms, which weakened the
relevance of common carrier

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.149
principles as a
framework in this case.

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:08.440
What does this all mean though?

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.020
Basically, this decision would
allow broadband providers

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.820
much more freedom in
creating new pricing

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.930
models for internet,
and to strike deals

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.930
with internet companies
or content providers

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.810
deliver their content
more readily to consumers.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.640
We don't know yet how
a ruling like this

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.670
would shake out in deals among
the ISPs, internet companies,

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.810
and content providers, and then
trickle down to us consumers,

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.850
but one possible scenario
is tiered internet service

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.980
where ISPs could charge
more to companies

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.500
like Netflix or Google to
deliver their traffic faster.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.694
Together, just those two
companies make up over half

00:01:39.694 --> 00:01:41.110
of all internet
traffic, according

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.750
to one study by the
firm Sandvine in 2013.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.810
But advocates for net neutrality
say that pricing environment

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.000
will hamper innovation,
in effect killing

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.750
the current open atmosphere,
where anyone with an idea

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.034
can build it online at
relatively low cost.

00:01:54.034 --> 00:01:56.450
And more broadly, some are
worried that the decision could

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.920
give broadband companies
too much power in deciding

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.584
what content is
freely available.

00:02:00.584 --> 00:02:02.250
I don't think too
many of us are in love

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.740
with the idea of Verizon
choosing what we can see,

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.090
but does this mean that
net neutrality is dead?

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.009
Not exactly.

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.759
FCC chairman Tom Wheeler
pointed out in a blog post

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.010
that the court's decision
did concede that the FCC has

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.840
the authority and
the responsibility

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.134
to regulate the activities
of broadband networks.

00:02:18.134 --> 00:02:19.550
In other words,
the court rejected

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.290
the framework
offered by the FCC,

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.190
but not the idea that they can
regulate internet providers.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.370
Someone just has to come
up with a better framework

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.380
for regulating the uncharted
territory that is the internet.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.910
And the FCC says
they might appeal

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.630
the ruling, in which
case it could end up

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.570
in the Supreme Court.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.760
But either way, the battle isn't
over, so let us know your take.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.500
Will this decision
be bad for consumers?

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.958
As always, you can
weigh in with us

00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.630
on Twitter or Facebook,
@DNews, and you

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.300
can ping me as well, @AnnieGaus.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.140
Thanks for watching.
