00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So at first we draw values from a normal distribution with µ and σ² parameters

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and say it equals a value A, then what's the mean and the variance of aA+b

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
where a and b are constants.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I'll give you possible answers down here from 1 to 7 and you have to plug an expression

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
to either one of those by giving me the corresponding number.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So if you think the expressions over here would be for example σ²+b², you type in 3 over here.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
If you think it's over here aσ², you type in 7, so either one of those, you have a number

00:00:37.000 --> 99:59:59.000
in mind 7 and as a hint, once an expression is used up, you can use it again.
