yeah so I think in the interest of time
 

00:31:22.649 --> 00:31:25.609 align:start position:0%
yeah so I think in the interest of time
let's<00:31:22.710><c> move</c><00:31:23.099><c> to</c><00:31:23.279><c> the</c><00:31:23.429><c> second</c><00:31:23.879><c> quit</c><00:31:24.590><c> season</c><00:31:25.590><c> I</c>

let's move to the second quit season I
 

00:31:25.619 --> 00:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
let's move to the second quit season I
