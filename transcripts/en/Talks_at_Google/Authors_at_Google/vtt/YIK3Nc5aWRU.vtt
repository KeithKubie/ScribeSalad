[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.397 --> 00:00:07.355
JEFF BOLIBA: Thank you.

00:00:07.355 --> 00:00:08.103
Hi, everyone.

00:00:08.103 --> 00:00:08.770
I'm Jeff Boliba.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.080
I'm the Vice President of
Global Resorts at Burton.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.210
And I've had the
pleasure of knowing

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.610
Kelly Clark for 18 years.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.440
She is absolutely incredible.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.110
Whether it's helping us out
with a resort photo shoot

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.780
or helping us introduce
really young kids

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.910
to snowboarding and
physical education

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.080
in elementary schools, Kelly
has always made the time.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.190
No matter what community
she's living in,

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.670
she always wants to give back.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.230
If you take a look
at her career,

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.900
it's absolutely incredible,
spanning 18 years,

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:50.350
five Olympics, three Olympic
medals, eight US Open medals,

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.960
and 14 X Games medals.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.500
Now if you stack her against
the top female athletes,

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:06.410
if you look right there, that
47% win rate is outstanding.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.460
So 47% of the time she entered a
snowboard competition, she won.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.450
So impressive.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.180
If you stack it against
the top male athletes,

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.720
once again, you'll see how
impressive that win rate is.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.340
So I'm very honored and excited
to introduce Kelly Clark to you

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.280
today.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.130
But before I do
that, I want to share

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.300
one of her winning moments.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.610
SPEAKER: The
winningest the US Open

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.110
rider in the history
of this event,

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.210
coming out of West
Dover, Vermont,

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.130
riding for Burton Snowboards,
this is Kelly Clark.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.040
What a show she put on today.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.780
And it was typical Kelly Clark.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.000
She drops in for her first run,
puts down a score of 86.88,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.910
the highest of the day.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.900
The other rider, she's not
too far ahead of [INAUDIBLE]..

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.490
What does she do
on her second run?

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.130
She ups it three points, 89.33.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.830
And I would not be surprised
right now if Kelly put down

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.169
a run in the 90s, even
though she doesn't need

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:10.150
it, even though this
her victory lap,

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.430
Kelly Clark might want to
just put an exclamation

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.415
point on this, so when you
look at the standings tomorrow,

00:02:14.415 --> 00:02:16.970
you know, oh, yeah, Kelly blew
the rest of the field away,

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.550
and she's doing so right now.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.520
Look at how high she's
landing on that transition.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.900
Tail right below the
lip, pumping the wall,

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.820
keeping a hard edge
to the flat bottom,

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.120
and going absolutely massive.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.370
Kelly Clark is just putting
on a clinic right now.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.780
That was unbelievable.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.130
JEFF BOLIBA: Wow.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.840
Ladies and gentlemen,
Kelly Clark.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.752
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:47.054 --> 00:02:49.940
KELLY CLARK: Thanks, Jeff.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.430
Thanks for the
introduction, Jeff.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.840
Thanks everybody for coming
and hanging out with us today.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.023
It's a huge honor
for me to be here.

00:02:59.023 --> 00:02:59.850
.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.460
I'm excited to get to share some
of my life, some of my process.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.670
Sports have such a good
way of just illustrating

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.550
kind of life's principles.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.690
I've been with Burton Snowboards
for the last 20 years.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.450
This marks my 20th
year with the brand,

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.220
which is a pretty
incredible relationship I've

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.803
had with them.

00:03:19.803 --> 00:03:23.690
I've had a abnormally
long snowboard career.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:29.120
I'm technically very old to
be a pro snowboarder at 35.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.450
So it's been really fun, though.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.150
I've really learned
everything that I've

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.190
learned to kind of
develop into the person

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.920
that I am through snowboarding.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.990
They have kind of a
rubber meets the road type

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.160
of ability to show you
what you're capable of,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.050
and show you what you
built. I always say

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.900
I trained 30 seconds--

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.050
I trained four years for
a 30 second half pipe run.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.600
So there's a lot that goes
into the behind the scenes

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.210
that people don't see.

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:00.980
Any snowboarders in here?

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.490
Any skiers in here?

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:03.260
OK.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.010
You guys can stay.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.760
We still like you.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.230
[LAUGHING]

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.890
I was up in Tahoe last week.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.210
And there's a lot
better snow than there

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.720
has been in the last few years.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.680
So it should be a
really fun winter.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.570
I grew up in Vermont.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.990
I live in Sacramento
currently, and I started

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:22.852
snowboarding when I was seven.

00:04:22.852 --> 00:04:24.560
It was the first year
it was even allowed

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.130
at my home resort, 1990.

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.170
I always say that I
started snowboarding

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.120
before it was cool.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.180
There was no such thing
as the Winter X Games.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.620
And it was long before it
ever became an Olympic sport.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.290
And honestly, I never
wanted to compete.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.150
It was really--

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.870
I actually was a ski racer.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.380
And I skipped enough
ski racing practice

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.955
to have my parents
stop paying for that,

00:04:50.955 --> 00:04:52.580
just so I could
snowboard all the time.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.210
And I never wanted to compete,
because the kind of ski racing

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.910
vibe was really cutthroat
and competitive.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.670
And as a young kid, it
just didn't appeal to me.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.010
And I had the opportunity
to go to a high school,

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.590
where it was essentially
a private school where

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.040
I could go to school half
day and snowboard half day,

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.750
and that sounded like a
pretty good gig to me.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.410
And I just knew I wanted to
spend more days on the hill.

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.023
And to be able to go to this
school, I had to compete.

00:05:18.023 --> 00:05:19.940
So I thought, OK, I'll
get in the competition.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.470
That was when I
was 14 years old.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.390
And I actually just kind
of fell in love with it.

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.180
I was halfway decent
at it, which was great.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.160
And I really enjoyed it.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.790
And then I remember,
you don't often

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:38.030
think you make big decisions
when you're 14 years old.

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.670
It was 1998, and it
was the first year

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:43.100
that snowboarding
became an Olympic sport.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:47.880
And I remember I had
recorded it on a VHS tape.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:48.380
Anybody?

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.552
VHS tapes.

00:05:49.552 --> 00:05:51.260
I probably like,
recorded over an episode

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.343
of "Friends" or something.

00:05:52.343 --> 00:05:56.660
But I had recorded the
Olympics, snowboarding's debut.

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.970
And I remember everything
about that day.

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.380
I remember where I was.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.018
I remember what I was wearing.

00:06:02.018 --> 00:06:03.560
I remember what the
weather was like.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.770
And I saw snowboarding
become an Olympic sport,

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.790
and I knew right then and there
that this was a dream, that I

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.710
wanted to give my life to.

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:18.050
And four years later, I found
myself in my first Olympics

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:19.820
in 2002.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.550
I then followed it up
with Italy and Torino.

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.940
Vancouver, Sochi, Russia,
and then my last Olympics

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.040
was in Korea.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.180
So over 16 years,
I've had the privilege

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.090
representing my country
five different times.

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.670
And I've won, lost, draw.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:38.330
All that.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.830
I've had a wide range
of Olympic experiences.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.580
And it's been fun to
kind of pull on those

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:48.730
and see the personal
growth in my life.

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.050
Through snowboarding,
I've learned

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:55.230
to be successful, so to speak.

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.590
I've learned a great
deal about failure.

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:03.698
But more so than anything, I've
learned to enjoy what I do.

00:07:03.698 --> 00:07:05.490
And that's what I want
to talk about today.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.360
How do we not only
be successful,

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.850
but how do you actually
thrive in the environment

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:12.390
that you're in?

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:16.070
And, you know, I live in
a performance culture.

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:18.440
Every weekend in the
winter, I go out there

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.310
and see what I built, and
see if I have what it takes.

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.320
But you don't have
to be an Olympian

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.790
to find yourselves living
in a performance culture.

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:29.990
We only have to
pick up our phones

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.740
to have a glance at social media
and start comparing ourselves

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:34.950
to one another.

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:38.442
It's where we find ourselves
living a lot of the time,

00:07:38.442 --> 00:07:39.650
is in this performance world.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.127
But the good news is
is just because we

00:07:45.127 --> 00:07:47.210
live in this culture, it
doesn't mean that culture

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:50.040
gets to live with inside of us.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.280
So there's a few
things that I want

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.860
to touch on today
that have really

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.735
helped me learn to thrive
in that environment

00:07:55.735 --> 00:07:58.040
and that performance world.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.745
And I'm just going
to hit on those.

00:07:59.745 --> 00:08:02.120
And I'm going to tell a few
stories to kind of illustrate

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:02.700
that.

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:03.575
Does that sound good?

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:10.150
So we talk about
performance culture,

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:12.670
but what does that
actually mean?

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:17.410
In the performance world, it
says, I wonder if I'm enough.

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:20.650
I will sacrifice respect
and honor to get ahead.

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:22.490
I will work for everything.

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:26.800
And I will compete to
earn what I deserve.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.510
And this is the big thing.

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:30.580
External success is
the only thing that

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:33.038
matters in a performance world.

00:08:33.038 --> 00:08:35.580
So those are the things, that's
a place we find ourselves in.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:38.320
It seems pretty extreme when
I list it out like that.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.450
But those are the things--

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:42.557
that's the race we find
ourselves in a lot of the time.

00:08:42.557 --> 00:08:45.140
And I'm just going to touch on
thriving here for a minute too.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:49.960
How many of you guys
have succulents at home?

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:50.520
Anybody?

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.500
Proud succulent owner?

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:57.060
Would you say they're
thriving, or RIP succulents?

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.380
Maybe RIP succulents, huh?

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.900
That happens.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:05.460
You know, you can be
successful and not be thriving,

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.160
but it's hard to be thriving
and not feel successful.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.890
And it only takes us
looking at our house plants

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:12.187
to see if something's thriving.

00:09:12.187 --> 00:09:13.770
And usually when
something's thriving,

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.570
it means that it's growing.

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:18.210
And that's honestly
what it means to thrive.

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:20.970
If something's growing, we say,
oh, we put that plant right

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:22.390
where it needed to be.

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:25.220
We gave it the right
amount of water.

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:26.790
It's in the right environment.

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:29.230
And when it grows,
that's what we say.

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:30.900
Hey, my plants are thriving.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.180
I don't know how many green
thumbs we have in here.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:37.760
But I know you
often think you're

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.230
thriving when you're winning.

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:42.362
You think you're thriving
when you're successful.

00:09:42.362 --> 00:09:43.820
But as I'll kind
of dive into this,

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:45.678
success just looks like growth.

00:09:45.678 --> 00:09:47.720
And that's what we need
to be doing in our lives.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:51.870
And that's what we need to
be putting in the win column.

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:55.050
So the few things that
I want to bring up

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:58.530
that I've really found in
my career that have helped

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:04.650
me be successful and
thrive and enjoy what I do,

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:07.330
honestly, it all starts
with our identity.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.860
It's so easy to get
a sense of self-worth

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:14.550
and a sense of significance
wrapped up in our performance.

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:16.332
In sports, we see it the most.

00:10:16.332 --> 00:10:17.790
We see that the
roughest transition

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:20.350
is when people-- when
athletes retire, because they

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:23.640
get so much of their self-worth
in their performance.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.023
And it's a natural thing to do.

00:10:25.023 --> 00:10:26.440
That's how we
identify each other.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.680
When we meet people, we
say, oh, who are you,

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.300
and what do you do?

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:35.730
It's very easy to find yourself
operating in that place.

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:38.950
But I'd like to
propose that success

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:40.940
isn't what we're looking for.

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:43.240
I think we're looking for a
deep sense of significance.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.330
And I think we try to
fill that with success

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:47.680
and with performance.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:51.490
I know I've done that
a ton in my career.

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:56.162
When your self-worth is
tied to your performance,

00:10:56.162 --> 00:10:56.995
we can't take risks.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:00.630
Think about it.

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:04.820
If I'm in a snowboard
contest, and--

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:08.510
I'll actually use an
example from Russia.

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:12.260
Heading into the 2014 Olympics,
I was a heavy gold medal

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:13.910
favorite.

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:16.670
I was supposed to perform well.

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:19.820
I was probably, if I looked back
at my career, that was probably

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:22.250
kind of the prime time
of my snowboard career.

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:25.220
And I was 30 years old and
it was my fourth Olympics.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:27.873
I had kind of all the
bugs out of my system.

00:11:27.873 --> 00:11:29.540
I was pretty comfortable,
knowing what I

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:31.830
wanted to accomplish that time.

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:38.250
And when we showed up for
the event, it was 55 degrees.

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:42.440
And if anybody knows what snow
does when it's 55 degrees,

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.250
it becomes very challenging.

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:50.720
And I took my first
run at 1:00 PM,

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:54.200
and three rounds of competition
happened before my final run,

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.767
which was around 9:00 PM.

00:11:55.767 --> 00:11:57.350
And if you can imagine
in those temps,

00:11:57.350 --> 00:12:01.400
the pipe deteriorated
in epic fashion.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:06.320
When I showed up for
finals, I remember

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.080
I took five runs in
practice for finals,

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:12.680
and I moved my 1080
three different times.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.450
And I couldn't get it to work.

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:18.020
I fell five runs in a row
in my practice for finals.

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:19.760
And now, that
doesn't necessarily

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.998
mean you're going to
fall in the contest.

00:12:21.998 --> 00:12:23.540
But especially, at
the Olympics, like

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:25.700
you want your
practice to go well.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.640
It's going to kind of set
the tone for your performance

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.710
that evening.

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:35.300
I remember I went down, and I
saw a sea of Team USA people

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:38.150
kind of staring at me, knowing
that the train had completely

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:39.980
fallen off the tracks.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:42.163
And I saw my sports
psychologist,

00:12:42.163 --> 00:12:44.330
and I looked at her, and I
said, hey, you know what?

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:48.350
I actually need to go
and have a good cry.

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:51.240
And then I think I'm
going to be ready.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:56.120
I think if your significance
and your personal view

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:59.120
is tied to your
performance, you really

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.460
can't take those risks
that you need to,

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:05.210
because everything in life is
an opportunity or a threat.

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:08.330
And I needed to look at that
moment as an opportunity.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:12.050
And in a performance
world, we're

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:14.510
at our worst when we're afraid.

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:16.265
If you ever seen somebody--

00:13:16.265 --> 00:13:18.533
I heard a story of someone
drowning, you know.

00:13:18.533 --> 00:13:20.450
When somebody goes to
save them, they actually

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:23.630
try to drown the person
that's trying to save them.

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:27.080
We are at our worst
when we are afraid.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:31.190
And I was looking at these
next two runs in the Olympics.

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:34.280
I had waited four years.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.440
I had spent an entire
lifetime since I

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.870
was 14 investing in this dream.

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:43.190
And it's going as bad
as it possibly can go.

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:45.870
After my ugly cry,
I went to the top.

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:47.750
And I said, OK, this
is an opportunity

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:50.230
to overcome a bad situation.

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:51.890
And you know what happened?

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:56.690
My next run, I went, and I
landed my 10 for the first time

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:59.260
that night, but took
off early on my seven.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:00.770
And I hit the deck.

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:03.320
And I like to call it like,
a reverse taco, if you

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.520
can imagine that.

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:07.070
I bounced to the
flat, reverse taco,

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:10.850
and I fell in epic fashion.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:13.490
And I was probably more
prepared for a first run

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:15.530
fall than a poor practice.

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:18.710
I knew, even though, I'd
fallen six runs in a row,

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:20.880
I still had an opportunity.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.390
If I was so caught up in
the expectation of being

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:25.670
the gold medal favorite,
if I was so caught up

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:28.650
in maintaining my reputation
and what people thought,

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:31.460
and what I even
demanded of myself,

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.280
I would not be in an
opportunity position.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.540
I would be in a threat.

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:39.560
And in a performance world,
we need to be at our best.

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:42.120
I went back to the top,
and I saw my coach.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:45.690
And we had been through this
scenario a lot of times.

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:48.470
Those first run
falls, it happens.

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:50.060
This last week,
I was counting up

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:53.650
a bunch of my competition bibs.

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:57.050
And I have over 190.

00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:00.410
And so those first run falls,
it's happened a few times.

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:01.670
And I went back up.

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:05.390
And to be quite honest,
it was the hardest thing

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:06.780
that I ever did.

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:08.800
But I told my coach,
hey, what an opportunity.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.230
Six runs, I've
fallen consecutively.

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:14.030
I was the last person to
go over the entire event,

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:15.700
because I'd qualified
first for finals,

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.780
and we run in reverse order.

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:20.360
And I dropped in
and I landed a run.

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.420
And it was good enough to
put me on the Olympic podium.

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:27.410
And I'd fallen in six runs in
a row, only to land my seventh,

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:29.340
when it mattered most.

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:33.080
And I was so proud
of my performance.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.240
It wasn't necessarily
my best snowboarding.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.580
I've snowboarded a
lot better than that.

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:41.360
But to overcome that
personally in that situation,

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:45.110
I was really able to--

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:48.200
those situations, they reveal
where your identity is.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:52.370
When you look to what you're
responding to around you,

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:54.470
and how you're going to
react in those situations,

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:55.970
we need to be our best.

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:58.310
And that sort of
outlook, looking

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:01.488
at things as an opportunity,
is really a big way to do that.

00:16:01.488 --> 00:16:02.280
How you guys doing?

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.120
You're awfully quiet.

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:03.745
Everybody good?

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:11.910
So the next thing
I want to touch on

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:14.970
is we need to have a
healthy idea of success.

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:17.178
If you want to thrive in
a performance culture,

00:16:17.178 --> 00:16:19.470
that's something that you're
going to have to work out.

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:22.950
What does success
look like to you?

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:27.330
You know, honestly, that's what
I set out to do with my book.

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:32.820
I wanted to help people define
success in a healthy way.

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:36.870
As you can gather,
my idea of success

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:40.230
necessarily isn't
confined to just winning.

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:43.530
If I were to say what my
personal definition of it

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:48.777
is, I want to be able to look
back at my journey and say,

00:16:48.777 --> 00:16:50.610
I was really faithful
with the opportunities

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:55.020
that were in front of me,
and I didn't let one go by.

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:58.770
And I also ask myself
if I was growing.

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:01.110
If those two things are
happening in my life,

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:03.750
if I made the most
of my opportunities,

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:07.680
and I had some
measure of growth,

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:10.349
honestly, that's more successful
than you could ever hope to be.

00:17:14.849 --> 00:17:16.813
And the last thing
of my little mini

00:17:16.813 --> 00:17:18.480
list here that I want
to set you guys up

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:22.230
with is, after 20
years of snowboarding,

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:26.280
I've come to the conclusion
that if your dream only includes

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:29.090
you, it's too small of a dream.

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:31.610
I found that we're
really thriving in life

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:34.785
when other people are involved.

00:17:34.785 --> 00:17:36.410
You know, whatever
culture you live in,

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:40.700
whatever dream you're building,
if you're the only one in it,

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:43.700
it's just too small of a dream.

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:45.920
If you build your
yourself, your influence

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.970
will go away when you're
no longer performing.

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:52.300
You limit yourself if
you only build yourself.

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:56.260
We have to figure out how to
build things that will outlast

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.450
our ability to perform.

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:02.230
So a few of the just kind of
fundamental building blocks.

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:05.620
We've got to work out
that identity piece.

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:08.620
We have to develop a
healthy idea of success.

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:12.460
And we have to find
value in building others.

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:14.830
But the most important
thing that I've

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:20.290
learned throughout my career
has really helped me thrive.

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:24.092
I've learned to look at
the things that no one sees

00:18:24.092 --> 00:18:26.050
and treat them as more
valuable than the things

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:29.050
that everyone sees.

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:32.080
If it sounds strange and
unfamiliar, it's because it is.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.440
It's not natural.

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.560
It's not our go-to.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:39.670
But the world inside of me
and the personal victories

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:45.910
and the wins that aren't on TV,
that nobody beyond my friends

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:50.380
and family will ever
see, those are the things

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.750
that I value much more
than any placement,

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:55.155
than any medal that I can win.

00:18:55.155 --> 00:18:56.530
The world inside
of you has to be

00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:59.900
more important than
the world around you.

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:03.260
If you ever find yourself--

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:06.440
if you ever feel like
life's happening to you,

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.450
it's a pretty good
indication that you're not

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:12.650
living from a value set
and making decisions.

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:14.270
You're not living intentionally.

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:16.160
You're living reactionary.

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:19.760
And we really have to
work on this inner world,

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.570
this idea of success,
this identity stuff.

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:25.740
Our big picture and
building others.

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:30.640
And we have to learn to
treat the things that nobody

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:34.060
sees as more important than
the ones that are on display?

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:36.460
So there is a--

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:42.990
how many of you guys watched
the Olympics this last year?

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:44.550
Anybody catch the
woman's half pipe?

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:45.442
I was there.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.050
You know, this is
the ultimate story

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:54.580
of valuing things that no
one sees more than what

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:56.770
the NBC cameras will show you.

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:04.400
I set out to do the
impossible last year.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:08.150
No woman from the US had ever
made five winter Olympic teams

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:09.680
in any sport.

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:14.430
And, you know, I've been the
veteran now for, I don't know,

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:17.630
10 years in snow boarding.

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:19.820
The women that I compete
with are quite literally

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:20.910
half my age.

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:23.450
If I remember, I believe
it was two summers ago,

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:26.250
I was on the podium
with two women.

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:30.560
And if you added up their ages,
it literally equaled mine.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:31.940
And I'm 35.

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:33.723
It's like, I'm not old.

00:20:33.723 --> 00:20:35.640
I didn't think I was
old, until I look around,

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.690
and they say the TV shows that
I like aren't funny because they

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:42.072
have live studio audiences.

00:20:42.072 --> 00:20:42.780
It's interesting.

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:44.000
It happens quick.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:52.040
But I knew this Olympics
would be my last rodeo.

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:55.100
It would be the last time I
got the chance to do this.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:58.980
And in January, I found myself
named to the Olympic team.

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:02.220
And it was in Mammoth
Mountain California,

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:04.530
which was my home
resort for a long time.

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:07.940
And it was just a sweet win at
that final Olympic qualifier.

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:10.158
Now they named the
Olympic qualifier--

00:21:10.158 --> 00:21:12.200
they named the Olympic
team, the last qualifiers,

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:15.320
only two weeks before
opening ceremony starts.

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:18.560
So it's not this,
you know you're

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:19.760
on the team for a long time.

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:21.740
There's literally two weeks.

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:24.220
And I think the night that
you get named to the team,

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:26.660
the team manager is calling
you to book your plane ticket,

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:28.280
because they need to pay for it.

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:32.120
And there's a small
contest that falls in

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:34.820
between when they name the team
and when we go to the Olympics.

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:36.740
And it's called the X Games.

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:41.118
And a lot of people will--
you can look at it two ways.

00:21:41.118 --> 00:21:43.160
You can look at it as an
opportunity or a threat.

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.140
You could say, hey, this
is a great opportunity

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:48.530
to go to this big event and get
ready for the biggest event.

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:50.668
Or I could play it
safe and say, you know,

00:21:50.668 --> 00:21:51.710
I don't want to get hurt.

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:55.900
I should probably protect
myself and play it safe.

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:58.510
Which is something I've
never been good at it.

00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:00.610
And best way to get
ready for a big contest

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:01.880
is going to a big contest.

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.270
And so I go to
this event, and I'm

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:07.078
trying to get my snowboarding
to where it needs to be.

00:22:07.078 --> 00:22:08.370
And my first run's pretty good.

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:11.910
I think I'm sitting in
second or third place.

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:14.590
And I'm pushing myself,
trying to get my snowboarding

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:15.790
to where it needs to be.

00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:19.200
And in my second run, I
go down extremely hard.

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:24.390
I hit the deck again
and bounced to the flat.

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:27.400
And I actually was pretty
OK up until that point.

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:34.020
But when I hit the flat, my
left knee was so crumpled--

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:34.920
I was so crumpled.

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:37.560
My left knee hit
my left shoulder.

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:42.390
And I heard a loud
pop in my left knee.

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:45.750
And I remember sitting there
with the Mega Mo Follow Cam Ski

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:50.110
Guy in my face with a camera,
not being able to breathe,

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:53.400
because I had knocked the wind
down myself, thinking, I'm

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.480
pretty sure I just blew my ACL.

00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:01.360
And I'm thinking, I just
made the Olympic team.

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:05.350
And I don't think I'm ever
even going to get to go.

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:07.030
So I pick myself up.

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:09.370
I go down to the
bottom of the pipe.

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:12.680
And the US team, we have all
of our doctors and surgeons

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:13.180
on hand.

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:19.090
And I say, hey, I'm
pretty sure I heard a pop,

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:22.870
and I'm pretty sure I just
heard my ACL go in my knee.

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:26.590
And I can already feel
there's fluid in the top

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:29.500
of my calf above my
boots filling with fluid,

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.270
and my joints beginning
to stiffen up.

00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:34.210
And so we go there,
and X Games has

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:35.740
their team of
orthopedic surgeons,

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:37.900
and my own team of
orthopedic surgeons.

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:40.150
And there's a manual
test you can do-- you

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:43.300
guys are familiar-- to kind of
see if you have an endpoint.

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:45.520
So they're doing all
the manual tests.

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:49.930
Multiple high level orthopedic
guys are all testing my knee,

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:52.810
and they think I
have an endpoint.

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:54.787
We think you have an ACL.

00:23:54.787 --> 00:23:56.620
But we're going to have
to wait till Monday.

00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:59.120
And we'll get the MRI, and we'll
figure out what's going on.

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:00.910
Monday comes around.

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:05.620
And the radiologist is looking
at the films after my MRI.

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:07.402
And they can kind of--

00:24:07.402 --> 00:24:09.610
they know how to read the
films, and they can kind of

00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:11.277
get an idea of what's
going on in there.

00:24:11.277 --> 00:24:13.040
So I was asking the
guy, I was like, hey,

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:15.580
do you see my
ligaments in there?

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:16.963
You know, how's it look?

00:24:16.963 --> 00:24:19.630
And he's like, you know, I don't
know much about your ligaments,

00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:23.520
but I do see the tibial plateau
fracture that's clear as day.

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:26.580
And I thought, I'm sorry, what?

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:28.770
He's like, yeah, the
fracture in your tibia.

00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:30.600
That's really clear to see.

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.350
I don't know if you
have ligaments or not.

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:35.400
But definitely broke your leg.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:40.280
And I didn't see that coming.

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:41.795
I talked to my
surgeon that night,

00:24:41.795 --> 00:24:44.530
and I said, hey,
what's going on?

00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:46.652
And he said, you have an ACL.

00:24:46.652 --> 00:24:48.360
You have a severe bone
bruise, and you've

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:51.630
cracked your tibial plateau.

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:56.820
The good news is is it's
in an area where it's not

00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:58.392
extremely weight bearing.

00:24:58.392 --> 00:24:59.850
But you definitely
have a fracture.

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:03.820
What does this mean?

00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:05.362
You know, what are
we looking at now?

00:25:05.362 --> 00:25:09.790
We've got maybe week and a
half until we fly to Korea.

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:12.640
So we get my coach on the phone,
and we look at everything.

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:15.330
And they say, hey,
you know, we think

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:17.920
we can get you through this.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:20.550
And he said, here's the plan.

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:24.030
We brace you up with this
giant mechanical leg.

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:28.620
We medially load your knee to
create a little bit of space

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:33.270
in your joint, and we load
you up on WADA and USADA

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:36.240
approved anti-inflammatories.

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:40.590
And you have to agree
not to practice up

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:44.920
until semi-qualifiers
for the Olympic games.

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:51.240
And I said, hey, I
think we can do that.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.520
But I had to ask my coach.

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:55.460
I said, hey, if you
want to send somebody

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:57.590
who perhaps doesn't
have a broken leg,

00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:59.210
I would give up my spot.

00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:00.110
I understand.

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:00.860
I understand that.

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:03.450
He said, no, I would
always bet on you.

00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:04.760
You know?

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:09.680
And so I have the most
incredible support team.

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:12.530
And I put full faith
and full trust in them.

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:17.852
And I flew to my fifth Olympics
with a fractured tibia.

00:26:17.852 --> 00:26:19.310
I remember I was
late for my plane,

00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:21.230
actually, in San
Francisco, and I

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:24.110
was trying to get to
the plane quickly,

00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:25.910
and I couldn't even run walk.

00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:26.840
It was excruciating.

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:31.550
And I'm thinking,
what am I doing?

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:33.120
I got to Korea.

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.900
We gradually got me in the gym.

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:38.900
I didn't practice
for the entire event.

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:43.400
I think I took three runs in
the half pipe before qualifiers.

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:47.630
Qualifiers came around,
and I just barely

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:50.820
snuck in there, because I mean,
every half pipe's so different.

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:53.840
And honestly, learning to
ride with a mechanical leg.

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:58.095
This sort of brace was very new
and very challenging for me.

00:26:58.095 --> 00:26:58.970
And I snuck in there.

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:00.560
They took 12 people
in the finals,

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:02.000
and I qualified in 11th.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.060
It was not my best
snowboarding, but I made it.

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:10.430
And I was honestly believing
the dream again at this point.

00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:13.160
I was thinking, gosh,
I've overcome so much.

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:16.640
I totally want that
fairy tale ending.

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:18.470
I want that medal.

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:23.600
I want one more kind of
just that fairy tale ending.

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.220
I wanted to finish well.

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:32.700
And I can honestly
say the day of finals,

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:37.960
anti-inflammatory
pills, adrenaline,

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:42.090
whatever it was, I
can honestly say,

00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:44.580
my injury did not
affect my performance.

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:50.790
That day, I rode lights out, as
the kids say, out of my mind.

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:54.090
And I rode so well.

00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:57.540
I put down three runs that
were perfect, in my mind.

00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:03.190
I could have dealt with less
tears and more practice.

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:06.810
But my performance that
day, it was as good

00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:07.740
as it could have been.

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:11.090
I put down some of my best
runs at my fifth Olympic games.

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:19.440
And I came so far,
overcame so much.

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:23.220
And I was waiting for my
final score to pop up.

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:26.430
And I didn't see the letter, or
the number one, two, or three,

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:29.160
but I saw the
number four pop up.

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.260
And I would remain in fourth.

00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:34.530
Keeping my Olympic streak alive,
to never worse than fourth,

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:35.920
which is pretty good.

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:39.990
But fourth, you only get
your participation medal

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:41.490
from the Olympics,
which is probably

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:44.350
controversial in itself,
participation medals.

00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:46.350
But I didn't get on the podium.

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:51.650
And I remember standing
there, and I had

00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:54.380
a microphone put in my face.

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:57.380
And in front of millions
and millions of people,

00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:01.070
I was asked for a reason
why this didn't work out.

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:02.330
What happened, Kelly?

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:04.220
What went wrong?

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:10.290
And I had every opportunity
to find a reason why.

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:12.990
I actually had a
good reason why.

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:14.640
PS, I broke my
leg two weeks ago.

00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:18.390
But you know what happened?

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:22.200
The world inside of me
popped to the surface.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:28.020
And I was able to respect the
people I was competing with.

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:32.160
I was able to respect the
judging and the formats.

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:38.030
I was able to keep my
integrity and keep my honor.

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:40.280
And the world
inside of me proved

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:42.800
to be much bigger than the world
that I was in at that time.

00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:54.130
People always ask me what one
of my Olympic medals, which

00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:56.110
I brought with me today--

00:29:56.110 --> 00:30:00.210
I'll let you guys all
check them out at the end.

00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:01.960
You know, which one
of your Olympic medals

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:03.340
means the most to you?

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:06.550
And I've really found that
they're very prestigious,

00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:09.370
but it's what they represent
that gives them value.

00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:16.270
And you value things based
off of what they cost you.

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:18.880
You know, some of
these medals are

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:23.380
more expensive than perhaps
the one when I was 18.

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:25.030
You know?

00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:27.670
I won Olympic gold in Salt Lake
City when I was 18 years old.

00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:30.370
And it's easy being a rookie.

00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:31.070
No expectation.

00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:31.570
No pressure.

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:38.140
Russia, I would say, is
probably my favorite medal,

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:39.570
because I know what it cost me.

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:40.570
It was so expensive.

00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:44.500
It took everything that I had.

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:48.160
You know, my idea of
a fairy tale ending

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:52.730
was one more shot at
that Olympic podium.

00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:57.400
But I think standing
upright in the face of loss,

00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:00.790
in the face of
disappointment, was perhaps

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:04.030
the most valuable end
that I ever could've had.

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:06.460
And that moment was
much more costly.

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:09.820
Keeping your integrity
cost a lot sometimes.

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:14.170
You don't find it in very
fun situations, often.

00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:17.020
But I'm beginning to
see that, perhaps, I

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:19.960
should view that experience
differently because

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:23.380
of the success and the
win that actually happened

00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:26.830
on the inside of me
that people wouldn't say

00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:29.110
was necessarily successful.

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:31.660
No one knew what I
overcame that day.

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:39.050
At the end of the
event, I went home,

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:44.270
and I had hundreds of text
messages and voice mails

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:45.020
and emails.

00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:50.000
And I kind of just bleary
eyed stared at my phone.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.540
And there was one
message that popped up

00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:58.750
that caught my
attention, and I think,

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:03.030
speaks to the value of what
actually happened that day.

00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:07.170
It's from my longtime
manager, who I've been

00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:09.280
with since I was 15 years old.

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:14.600
And he had watched the
event on TV with his son.

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:18.070
And he wrote me this email
I'm going to read to you.

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:20.680
He said, "Congratulations
on an amazing finals.

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:22.720
If you've taught
me one thing, it's

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:25.150
that we're fools to allow
the judgment of others

00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:28.400
to influence our own
appreciation of performance.

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:31.090
This seems especially
true today.

00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:34.480
Having seen each of your Olympic
runs over your long career,

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.820
I can say this with
some of your best work.

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:39.418
You started strong, yet
strategically contained,

00:32:39.418 --> 00:32:41.710
pushed it further in the
second, and under the greatest

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:43.580
pressure, crushed
it in the third.

00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:46.375
It reminds me of Torino,
where you did more

00:32:46.375 --> 00:32:48.250
for women's snowboarding
than most gold medal

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:49.990
performances combined.

00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:52.120
You'll enjoy listening to
Todd Richards' commentary

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:54.610
about what he thought
about your run.

00:32:54.610 --> 00:32:58.480
I saw your interview after
the event with Tina Dixon.

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:01.390
I could see and feel your
frustration and disappointment,

00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:03.850
but your maturity and
perspective prevailed,

00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:05.740
and you showed
class and composure

00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:08.130
that few athletes could muster.

00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:09.520
Benny--" who's his son--

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:13.210
"who is now 14 was watching
with me, and he asked me, Dad,

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:16.510
how can she be so calm
and nice after that?

00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:18.232
I smiled when he asked me that.

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:23.140
Through five Olympics,
Kelly, you've

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:26.887
managed to find so many ways in
addition to winning and medals

00:33:26.887 --> 00:33:29.470
to inspire people to be better
than they could have previously

00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:30.790
imagined.

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:33.220
And as much as I know
you wanted to win,

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:35.620
and I wanted you to
win as a parent would,

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:37.330
it's much more
precious an opportunity

00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:40.960
to discover a moment
of such magnitude,

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:43.030
and as an athlete of
such profound talent

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:44.920
and historical
significance to demonstrate

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:46.600
the values you embody.

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:49.120
There will be many medals
awarded over these Olympics,

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:50.745
but I know Benny
wouldn't have asked me

00:33:50.745 --> 00:33:53.350
that question had you not
thrown down the runs you did,

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:54.820
been dealt the
scores you received,

00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:56.790
and handled it the way you did.

00:33:56.790 --> 00:33:58.810
And in terms of
inspiration, it's

00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:02.560
moments like that can make a
huge difference in a kid's life

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:04.010
and in the world.

00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:05.560
I'm so proud of you, Kelly.

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:09.280
What you've done, who you are,
and how you've lived your life.

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:11.030
And I've been privileged
to be part of it.

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:12.405
And the effect
you have on people

00:34:12.405 --> 00:34:15.860
transcends results, medals,
and transcends snowboarding.

00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:17.739
I can't wait to see
how you inspire people

00:34:17.739 --> 00:34:21.040
outside of the half pipe,
whenever that may be.

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:23.020
And I promise you
that I'll support you

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:25.650
in those efforts however I
can for as long as I can."

00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:33.310
So we measure success based
off of what color medal we get,

00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:39.139
and we don't always place a
value on things like this.

00:34:39.139 --> 00:34:40.820
That was the message
that I needed

00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:45.010
to hear when I went home
heartbroken that day,

00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:53.170
realizing that there is so much
more than just performance.

00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:55.179
It wasn't something
everyone saw,

00:34:55.179 --> 00:34:57.790
but perhaps it's more valuable
than a million gold medals

00:34:57.790 --> 00:34:59.230
could ever be.

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:04.340
We have to build things that
outlast our ability to perform.

00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:08.930
My life is a testament
to going after a dream.

00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:12.340
We're supposed to go after
all that's in our hearts

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:14.320
and hit all of our potential.

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.820
And it's not going to be
all rainbows and butterflies

00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:17.430
all the time.

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:19.650
There's going to be
a lot of hard days.

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:22.070
But it should be enjoyable.

00:35:22.070 --> 00:35:23.890
We think everything
should always be fun,

00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:27.838
and people also hear
what I do for a living,

00:35:27.838 --> 00:35:29.630
and they say, wow, that
must be really fun.

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:32.840
And I'm like, it is really fun.

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:35.270
And a lot of people, especially
professional athletes,

00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:36.395
are like, why do you do it?

00:35:36.395 --> 00:35:37.843
You're like, it's so fun.

00:35:37.843 --> 00:35:38.510
Like, I'm sorry.

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:39.660
It's like, spoiler alert.

00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:41.520
It's not always going to be fun.

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.260
But it should be enjoyable.

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:47.360
And if you can work
out how to not be

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:52.580
defined by what you do,
how to build others up,

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:55.310
how to define success
in a healthy way,

00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:57.260
and how to value the
things that no one sees

00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:01.580
more than the things
that are on display,

00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:05.583
you will have a
successful career,

00:36:05.583 --> 00:36:07.250
and there's going to
be a lot of growth,

00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:08.930
you're going to be
thriving, and you're

00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:13.190
going to be enjoying
what you do.

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:19.820
For me as a snowboarder,
I've had a very long career,

00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:23.270
and I've had more success
than anyone could ever dream.

00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:25.940
When I was 14, I've had
more success than I ever

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:28.800
began to dream about.

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:29.300
.

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:33.510
And I'm so thankful, and
it's been such a privilege.

00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:35.900
And if it was about
accomplishing things,

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:38.600
if it was about winning
things, honestly,

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:41.113
I probably should have
stopped a long time ago.

00:36:41.113 --> 00:36:42.530
You have to figure
out how to make

00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:44.310
what you do more than that.

00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:47.930
You have to figure out how to
develop something inside of you

00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:52.930
that will sustain you no matter
what environment you go into.

00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:56.960
Burnout doesn't come
from too much activity.

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:59.240
If anybody should be burned
out, it should be me.

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:01.940
I've done a million
snowboarding contests.

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:04.400
It really comes from
unmet expectations.

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:08.930
And so if you can spend time
developing that inner world,

00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:11.090
you're going to be able
to go into any world

00:37:11.090 --> 00:37:15.200
and hit your potential, and
be your best, and enjoy it.

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:18.080
And always remember that if
your dream only includes you,

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:20.060
it's just too small of a dream.

00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:20.975
Thank you.

00:37:20.975 --> 00:37:25.430
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.460
AUDIENCE: I was curious,
at the beginning,

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:32.740
you said you were training
always for basically 30

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:34.640
seconds of a half pipe run.

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:37.120
And I'm curious how
you go about sort

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:39.910
of maintaining that
mindset of training when

00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:42.750
the actual
performance, to me, it

00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:46.593
seems like it's always so far
away, and such a blip in time.

00:37:46.593 --> 00:37:48.010
KELLY CLARK: You
know, I think you

00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:51.310
need to have an idea of what you
want to accomplish, regardless

00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:53.230
of what's going on around you.

00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:55.930
As I would approach
the Olympics,

00:37:55.930 --> 00:37:58.983
I knew where my snowboarding
was going to need to be.

00:37:58.983 --> 00:38:00.400
I think it's easy
to get caught up

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:05.500
in looking around to what my
fellow competitors were doing.

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:10.840
But if you can figure out what
it is you want to accomplish,

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:12.940
it's something that you
can work on regardless

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:14.265
of what's going on around you.

00:38:20.090 --> 00:38:24.290
So it may look like what
we do is kind of like,

00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:27.230
oh, my goodness, I just
tried this trick today.

00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:31.880
I think it took me seven
years to first land a 1080.

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:36.090
So it's very much in the
scope of what you want to do.

00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:38.030
And no matter what
you accomplish,

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:41.990
and especially in snowboarding,
like, you're never the best.

00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:44.610
And there isn't a day that goes
by that I'm not challenged.

00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:46.360
And I think that's
what kept me motivated,

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:48.050
as I enjoyed the challenge.

00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:49.950
I enjoyed constantly
learning things.

00:38:49.950 --> 00:38:52.010
And if I wasn't
learning new things,

00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:55.080
I probably wouldn't have been in
the game for as long as I was.

00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:55.910
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:58.657
So thematic to everything you've
been able to discuss today,

00:38:58.657 --> 00:39:00.490
did you ever have a
situation in your career

00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:03.070
where you felt disconnected
from the things that brought

00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:05.020
you and kept you in sport?

00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:07.480
And if so, how did you
recognize a disconnect?

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:09.638
How did you identify
that was happening?

00:39:09.638 --> 00:39:11.680
KELLY CLARK: I talk about
a lot of these concepts

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:13.472
and a lot of things
that have sustained me.

00:39:13.472 --> 00:39:16.960
I mean, goodness, I like,
I wrote a book about it.

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:22.100
But you just never
arrive in life.

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:24.460
And there's so
many times where I

00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:29.440
have to be willing to examine
my heart in situations

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:34.570
where I maybe didn't find my
inner world as well-developed

00:39:34.570 --> 00:39:37.210
as I hoped, where maybe
jealousy popped up.

00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:38.950
Maybe I wanted to be right.

00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:40.780
Maybe I wanted to
have an excuse.

00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:43.720
And the way that I
was able to really--

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:46.930
you have to be OK not
having it all together.

00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:48.610
You never master it.

00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:51.410
You have to be willing
to be a work in progress.

00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:56.710
And when I found myself
maybe not operating

00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:58.948
the way that I wanted to,
maybe I'm feeling really

00:39:58.948 --> 00:40:00.490
threatened all of
the sudden, and I'm

00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:01.810
like, wow, I thought I
had that figured out,

00:40:01.810 --> 00:40:03.935
I thought I looked at
everything as an opportunity,

00:40:03.935 --> 00:40:08.240
and I was killing it, I actually
really pulled on other people.

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:10.570
So being in community
and allowing people

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:13.960
into your process was
really, really healthy.

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:19.360
I think we have the idea,
especially in sports, where--

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:23.770
I mean, in all of
culture, we champion

00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:25.960
self-made millionaires.

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:28.480
We say, when you're isolated,
when you came from nothing,

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:29.800
and now you're something.

00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:34.370
I think you can be
successful, but it's not very

00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:36.337
fulfilling doing it that way.

00:40:36.337 --> 00:40:38.420
And letting people in--
behind every great athlete

00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:40.070
is a team of great people.

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:41.523
There's no self-made
millionaires

00:40:41.523 --> 00:40:42.440
in the athletic world.

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:45.890
And every time that
I failed, messed up,

00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:49.050
felt like I had learned
this lesson long ago,

00:40:49.050 --> 00:40:52.190
but I was relearning it
for the hundredth time,

00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:53.780
it was my coaches,
and it was people

00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:56.660
who believed in me
on the days that I

00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:58.980
didn't believe in myself.

00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:00.980
AUDIENCE: So first of
all, thanks for coming in.

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:02.750
Thanks for the talk.

00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:05.260
My question is that,
now looking back

00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:07.570
after having gone through
your career, if you were

00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:10.540
to look back and talk to
the 14-year-old you who

00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:13.360
was dreaming at the time,
and how things have changed

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:16.120
since then, what type of
advice and recommendation

00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:20.110
would you give that you didn't
necessarily have back then?

00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:23.050
KELLY CLARK: Honestly,
the most important thing

00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:25.210
that I've ever learned
in my snowboarding career

00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:26.290
is that identity thing.

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:34.387
I think not a lot of people get
to reach the top of something.

00:41:34.387 --> 00:41:36.720
Most of the time life is a
journey and, all of a sudden,

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:44.570
I was 18 years old, and I won
the X Games, the Olympics,

00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:46.880
and the US Open all
in the same season.

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:49.410
I'd accomplished everything
I ever wanted to do.

00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:53.090
And I just had
equated that success

00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:55.440
meant that I was fulfilled.

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:58.400
And at a really young age,
I had to figure that out.

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:00.500
I was like, wow, this
isn't what life's about.

00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:02.120
My life is not
complete because I

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:04.850
accomplished a list of to-dos.

00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:07.220
I had to develop a strong
sense of self outside of that.

00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:10.850
And in the sports world,
you just see it so plainly.

00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:14.330
There's such a
level of insecurity

00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:18.140
in performance culture
that is just unsettling.

00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:22.010
And so when I look at young
girls, that's the number one

00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:23.500
thing that I say
to young athletes,

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:26.600
hey, you got to
figure this part out

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:29.750
before you can navigate
this really well.

00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:35.480
Because it just makes it--

00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:38.170
just doesn't make it fun.

00:42:38.170 --> 00:42:41.260
There's so much more freedom
and so much more enjoyment

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:45.480
when you can sort that
identity piece out.

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:50.010
AUDIENCE: Where are your top
three mountains to snowboard?

00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:51.260
KELLY CLARK: What did you say?

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:55.832
AUDIENCE: What's your top
three mountains to snowboard?

00:42:55.832 --> 00:42:58.670
KELLY CLARK: I lived in
Mammoth, California forever,

00:42:58.670 --> 00:43:00.452
and I love that resort.

00:43:00.452 --> 00:43:02.660
They do a great job kind of
maintaining their terrain

00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:07.100
parks, and then they get
like, 300 days of sun.

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:12.620
And when it's not sunny,
it's just nuking snow.

00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:14.120
That's a great mountain.

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:19.730
Snowmass in Colorado is really
fun, if you like the groomers.

00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:23.000
Really top notch groomers there.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.180
And then my favorite
destination to go snowboarding

00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:27.770
would be Japan.

00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:30.742
Hokkaido, North Island Japan
is always my number one pick.

00:43:30.742 --> 00:43:32.450
You ever get the
opportunity to go there,

00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:34.678
I would highly recommend it.

00:43:34.678 --> 00:43:36.470
AUDIENCE: Thanks so
much for coming, Kelly.

00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:38.480
I'm curious just on
training routines,

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:39.980
training for an Olympics.

00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:42.020
What did a typical
day look like?

00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:45.300
And how did that change over
the course of your career?

00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:47.370
KELLY CLARK: Yeah,
that's a great question.

00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:50.480
Well, like I referenced
before, snowboarding really

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:52.550
wasn't a sport when I started.

00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:58.460
And there's so much kind of
lifestyle and easy goingness

00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:00.240
attached to it.

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:04.670
And I remember in 2010, I had
been to three Olympic games.

00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:06.290
I had two Olympic medals.

00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:08.933
And the US snowboard
team said, hey,

00:44:08.933 --> 00:44:10.850
would you like to come
in for fitness testing?

00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:13.670
Like, it just wasn't even
on our radar before then.

00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:16.070
We're not like real
athletes, you know?

00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:19.660
And so, I was like, yeah,
sure, that sounds good.

00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:24.150
I could do some high jumps
for you, or whatever.

00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:25.370
And I did it.

00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:28.280
And I was like, hey,
what do my results mean?

00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:31.550
And my trainer, to
this day, I still

00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:34.520
bring this up every once
in a while, she says, wow,

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:36.440
you are really mentally--

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:39.170
you must be really
mentally strong.

00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:42.070
And I was like, wait,
this is a fitness test.

00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:43.610
Like, that's like
telling someone

00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:45.830
have a nice personality,
or like, you're

00:44:45.830 --> 00:44:48.230
beautiful on the
inside, you know?

00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:49.430
And I'm like, seriously?

00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:51.860
And she's like, yeah, like
it's pretty incredible what

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:53.152
you've been able to accomplish.

00:44:53.152 --> 00:44:54.640
And I'm like, what?

00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:57.740
And hence, all this like,
inner personal, inner world

00:44:57.740 --> 00:44:58.370
development.

00:44:58.370 --> 00:45:00.260
You know?

00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:02.750
But I could have either
been really offended,

00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:04.470
or looked at it
as an opportunity.

00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:05.553
And I said, you know what?

00:45:05.553 --> 00:45:06.960
This is an untapped resource.

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:08.680
So in 2010, I said,
hey, let's figure out

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:10.430
what it looks like to
train a snowboarder.

00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:11.222
We don't even know.

00:45:11.222 --> 00:45:11.930
There's no data.

00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:15.260
We know how to train baseball
players and football players.

00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:19.160
But we don't know, what does
it look like for ideal body

00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:20.450
comps and different things?

00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:23.570
So I said, I give
you four years.

00:45:23.570 --> 00:45:25.610
And in those four years,
when I was mentioning

00:45:25.610 --> 00:45:29.720
kind of my peak of
my career, I went up

00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:33.200
to winning 86% of the
contests I entered.

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:35.960
And my consistency
and my durability

00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:37.550
went through the roof.

00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:40.430
And I was the only one on the
US team in a four year span

00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:42.900
who didn't require a surgery.

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:44.918
And I was older than everybody.

00:45:44.918 --> 00:45:46.460
And I was just like,
oh, my goodness,

00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:48.620
this is an incredible resource.

00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:52.040
And so, that was a big part of
the second part of my career.

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:54.470
And heading into
this last Olympics,

00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:58.190
I think I was logging 22 to
24 hours of dry land training

00:45:58.190 --> 00:45:59.180
a week.

00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:00.790
And it's a lot of--

00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:03.560
light and lean is what
we would train for.

00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:07.340
We'd have two days
of cardio, and we'd

00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:10.075
have two days of strength
training, three days of core.

00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:16.940
And they would kind of
overlap over a six-day span

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:18.260
with one day off.

00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:21.600
So light and lean, a
lot of stability stuff,

00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:24.490
a lot of body weight stuff.

00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:26.030
I can get more into
detail after it,

00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:27.980
but it's kind of a
work in progress.

00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:30.380
And we would profile
my body comps

00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:32.250
when I would
perform really well,

00:46:32.250 --> 00:46:34.160
and we'd start to
discover, OK, so

00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:36.840
I'm performing my best when
my body looks like this.

00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:37.340
OK.

00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:38.150
That's our target.

00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:40.240
Like, we were
starting from scratch.

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:40.740
So.

00:46:43.263 --> 00:46:44.430
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:46.550
Thanks for everything
you've done for the sport.

00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:49.910
My question is, being
a woman snowboarder,

00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:53.480
was there a point where you
realized that you were not only

00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:57.540
a champion for the
snowboarding sport as a whole,

00:46:57.540 --> 00:47:01.370
but for women boarders, and
then becoming a household name

00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:04.340
as a woman athlete?

00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:08.030
KELLY CLARK: Yeah, you know,
in snowboarding, there's

00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:12.700
not the different sized
ball that we play with.

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:15.110
We're on the same kind
of venue as the guys.

00:47:15.110 --> 00:47:20.690
And when I was growing
up, I was one girl kind

00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:21.650
of in a pack of guys.

00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:23.960
And I got on the US team.

00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:27.350
And then I found kind of a
crew of girls to ride with.

00:47:27.350 --> 00:47:31.430
And there was people who went
before me that really inspired

00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:34.580
me and that I looked up to.

00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:38.720
I remember waiting in line
to get people's autographs

00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:43.640
at the US Open, and then I found
myself a little kids waiting

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:46.370
in line to get autographs at
the US Open when I was 18.

00:47:46.370 --> 00:47:50.960
And I thought, gosh,
I am in a position

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:53.487
to be able to inspire people.

00:47:53.487 --> 00:47:55.070
And that's kind of
how I looked at it.

00:47:55.070 --> 00:47:57.530
I thought, I have
a responsibility

00:47:57.530 --> 00:48:01.555
and an opportunity to impact
people in a positive way.

00:48:01.555 --> 00:48:03.180
And I just looked at
it as a privilege.

00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:08.840
And I tried to do my best,
knowing that I really

00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:10.130
had a lot of influence.

00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:15.450
And, you know, there
is not a ton of--

00:48:15.450 --> 00:48:17.840
I think at Burton,
we have a woman CEO,

00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:20.420
and she's been an advocate
for women and for everything

00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:24.560
from equal prize money
to women in leadership

00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:27.480
at the company for
a very long time.

00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:32.360
And so, we didn't see it
as a huge kind of contrast

00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:33.860
between the men and
women, because I

00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:36.320
think I was so close to
it, and our leadership

00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:38.020
was always empowering women.

00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:39.770
It just kind of seemed
natural and normal.

00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:41.853
When I kind of grew up a
bit and saw other sports,

00:48:41.853 --> 00:48:45.710
I realized how unique
snowboarding actually was.

00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:51.560
So I just tried to make
sure that I was always,

00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:52.880
I guess, the same person too.

00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:54.470
I think anytime you're
in a place of influence

00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:56.870
you, want to be the same
person that you are when you're

00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:58.820
winning or losing, at
the top of the hill,

00:48:58.820 --> 00:49:00.540
at the bottom of the hill, when
you're home with your friends,

00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:01.915
and when you're
with your family.

00:49:01.915 --> 00:49:05.090
And so I strive to live
a life of consistency

00:49:05.090 --> 00:49:06.500
and authenticity,
because I think

00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:08.690
that's a huge attribute
in snowboarding

00:49:08.690 --> 00:49:10.130
that we have a huge value for.

00:49:10.130 --> 00:49:13.970
And I think it's
been a cool journey

00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:16.640
to see the sport
grow, especially

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:19.670
with the young women.

00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:21.370
AUDIENCE: I'm
curious again, sort

00:49:21.370 --> 00:49:25.510
of like a question about how
you deal with challenges.

00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:27.615
And when you take
these massive slams,

00:49:27.615 --> 00:49:28.990
you touched on
this a little bit,

00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:30.840
but I was wondering if you
could go into a little bit more

00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:33.187
detail about, what are
you really thinking about?

00:49:33.187 --> 00:49:34.770
Like, how do you
actually get yourself

00:49:34.770 --> 00:49:40.200
to come over that hurdle
right then and get yourself

00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:41.500
up and go again?

00:49:44.650 --> 00:49:46.225
KELLY CLARK: My
coach has a saying.

00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:53.540
If it was easy, everybody
would be doing it.

00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:59.650
And I heard that often
at the top of the pipe

00:49:59.650 --> 00:50:03.230
when I was discouraged.

00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:07.550
I kind of always had an idea
that nothing was impossible,

00:50:07.550 --> 00:50:09.050
and I wouldn't let
my circumstances

00:50:09.050 --> 00:50:10.860
decide things for me.

00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:12.750
So even when I did
take those big crashes,

00:50:12.750 --> 00:50:19.160
when I did take those big falls,
it was a mix of personal drive,

00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:23.250
and then people believing in me
and speaking into me as well.

00:50:23.250 --> 00:50:25.430
It was those coaches,
it was those friends,

00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:26.600
it was the people--

00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:30.740
being willing to ask for help
and not have it together all

00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:34.280
the time, and being willing
to be challenged and fail,

00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:37.310
to know that eventually you--

00:50:37.310 --> 00:50:38.960
what is it?

00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:40.680
Thomas Edison, he
just learned a bunch

00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:42.410
of ways not to
make a light bulb.

00:50:42.410 --> 00:50:45.708
Using all those
failures as like,

00:50:45.708 --> 00:50:47.000
I learned one way not to do it.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.540
I guess I should try again.

00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:51.270
And you want to stay-- you
know, snowboarding, especially,

00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:52.430
it's a high impact sport.

00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:54.347
And you want to stay
within your ability level

00:50:54.347 --> 00:50:55.362
when you take this.

00:50:55.362 --> 00:50:56.570
And you want to be realistic.

00:50:56.570 --> 00:50:59.045
And so in talking
to my coaches, do

00:50:59.045 --> 00:51:02.630
you think this is a realistic
trick for me to work on?

00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:05.050
And what kind of
steps am I going

00:51:05.050 --> 00:51:06.522
to need to take to get there?

00:51:06.522 --> 00:51:07.730
And not everything's instant.

00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:15.230
And I think getting
strong enough

00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:19.520
to take those risks, especially
as I got older in my career,

00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:21.270
was really helpful as well.

00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:25.610
So I knew if it didn't go well,
most likely, I would bounce.

00:51:25.610 --> 00:51:27.530
Hopefully, I would bounce.

00:51:27.530 --> 00:51:29.252
That was kind of my plan.

00:51:29.252 --> 00:51:30.980
[LAUGHING]

00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:34.260
Whether it's a good plan or not.

00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:36.210
Was there a specific
trick or anything

00:51:36.210 --> 00:51:38.670
else that made you
more nervous than usual

00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:42.720
before a run or an event?

00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:46.015
Typically, your most difficult
run or you most difficult trick

00:51:46.015 --> 00:51:47.140
is the one you think about.

00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:52.680
But it's kind of a catch-22,
because you really can only

00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:54.117
focus on one thing at a time.

00:51:54.117 --> 00:51:55.950
I remember we had a
sports psychologist come

00:51:55.950 --> 00:52:01.040
by our team one time, and
he gave us two tennis balls.

00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:05.220
One guy was supposed to throw
it up and down really quickly.

00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:07.950
And the other one were supposed
to be thrown across the room.

00:52:07.950 --> 00:52:10.830
And we were told to keep
track of how many times

00:52:10.830 --> 00:52:12.192
each tennis ball was thrown.

00:52:12.192 --> 00:52:14.400
After about 20 seconds he
said, what did you come up?

00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:16.117
We were like, oh,
we all lost count.

00:52:16.117 --> 00:52:17.200
And he said, m some point.

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:21.130
You can't focus on two
things at the same time.

00:52:21.130 --> 00:52:24.450
And my 1080 was probably
my hardest trick.

00:52:24.450 --> 00:52:30.620
But if I was thinking about
doing a 1080 on my third hit,

00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:33.450
when I dropped in
for my first hit,

00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:35.540
I guarantee you I would fall.

00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:37.310
First hit on a straighter.

00:52:37.310 --> 00:52:40.560
So, you know, you want to
anticipate those things.

00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:42.950
But by the time you
get to those events,

00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:44.450
by the time you get
to the Olympics,

00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:46.850
like, you should
have figured out.

00:52:46.850 --> 00:52:49.130
Those are muscle memory things.

00:52:49.130 --> 00:52:51.430
They can be intimidating,
but it's not

00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:53.180
going to be something
you're going to have

00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:54.350
to think your way through.

00:52:54.350 --> 00:52:57.240
Your body knows what
to do by that time.

00:52:57.240 --> 00:53:01.850
And it was really
a battle to really

00:53:01.850 --> 00:53:07.760
just stay on the task at
hand, or in the moment.

00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:10.190
I remember I was hiking
up, one of my friends

00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:14.280
that I snowboarded
with for a long time,

00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:15.620
we had the same coach.

00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:19.400
And she was talking through
her run with Ricky, my coach.

00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:21.530
And it's going to
look like this.

00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:22.400
I've got to do this.

00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:23.660
I've got to do this.

00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:27.077
And then I've got to
look here on this--

00:53:27.077 --> 00:53:29.160
I've got to be careful to
keep my speed, and that.

00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:32.240
And I'm like, listening
to her, like whoa.

00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:33.565
That's a lot.

00:53:33.565 --> 00:53:35.190
And Ricky looks at
me and he says, hey,

00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:36.390
what you going to do kid?

00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:39.190
I said, I'm going to
do a good drop in.

00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:41.410
And they just looked at
me, and they just laughed.

00:53:41.410 --> 00:53:43.160
They're like, seriously,
that's your plan?

00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:44.510
I'm like, totally.

00:53:44.510 --> 00:53:45.750
Everything else is--

00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:46.760
I know how to do it.

00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:48.660
I just have to make
sure I get in there.

00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:52.315
And so it's a fine line
between being prepared,

00:53:52.315 --> 00:53:54.440
and then, in the moment,
actually letting your body

00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:56.000
know what it knows how to do.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:56.880
JEFF BOLIBA: Thanks
so much, Kelly.

00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:57.440
This was awesome.

00:53:57.440 --> 00:53:58.910
KELLY CLARK: Well, thank
you very much, guys.

00:53:58.910 --> 00:54:00.785
JEFF BOLIBA: Another
round of applause maybe?

00:54:00.785 --> 00:54:03.630
[APPLAUSE]
