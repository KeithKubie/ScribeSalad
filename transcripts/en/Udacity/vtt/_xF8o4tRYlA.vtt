00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.250
Here's an example of a connection table.

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.665
As we can see each record contains the
most basic information about connection.

00:00:06.665 --> 00:00:10.770
In particular the source IP address,
source port, destination IP address,

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.010
destination port, and most importantly
the current connection state.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.060
For example whether it's established or
not.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.500
Internally to the firewall,

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.090
there could be another data structure
that is linked to the connection table.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.070
For example, for web traffic,
since a page can spend multiple packets,

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.520
this internal data structure
of the firewall can maintain

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.820
the contents of a page that
it has received so far.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.060
That is, this data structure which
is linked to the connection table

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.200
will allow the firewall to perform more
specific analysis of the connection.
