Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. Hi, I'm Robert Krulwich. This is Radiolab and we're talking about bliss. So far. I'm going to say we're not doing so great. I mean we had a fleeting moment, a dream that crumbled snowflakes that evaporated in your hand, but in the next story we're going to shoot for bliss that lasts. Hello, this is Mike Young. Mike, speak up. Andy comes to us from our producer, Andy Mills. Can you hear me? I can hear Ya. All right, so set this up. Who is this guy? His name is Mike Young. I called them up because of something that happened to him a little over 50 years ago. Let's see. This was 1962 is something that he still thinks about all these years later. I was in my early twenties 22 something like that. 21 he was an undergraduate at a theological school in Boston and one day he received a very different kind of religious education, a very different kind, good ds though. He event occurred on Good Friday

Speaker 2:          00:57          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:58          and it happened at the Boston University Marsh Chapel. He was sitting, not up in the main chapel, but down in the little basement chapel. And he was sitting with about 19 of his fellow classmates. The Meditation Service was being piped down to us from the chapel above. They have speakers in the front of this little chapel in the basement, had organ music and an excellent choir. And the voice of the preacher sentenced those is this kind of famous guy named Howard Thurman. And we relaxed. We're all good and interesting ideas began going off in my head, well beside us in the way that we take. Sometimes it was hard to pay attention to what was going on in the room, the things that resist and defy. And we slid jet a right into the, uh, silicide been experienced.

Speaker 1:          02:03          What we did, he said silicide yes. Was in magic. Mushrooms. Shrooms. What? You're gonna have to explain that one. This was actually something called the Marsh Chapel experiment, the Marsh Chapel experiment. And it was run by this guy. His name was Walter Pinky. Very briefly summarize that. And he was a graduate student at Harvard at this time and he was studying religious experience. Me.

Speaker 2:          02:31          Oh. This has also been called the cosmic experience. The transcendental experience or the mystical experience.

Speaker 1:          02:36          What exactly was he looking at? You know, like, um, Christians, Muslims, Jews, mystics. Like what kind of things do they all have in common? So he did a bunch of research and interviews and he came up with a basic catalog of the ingredients in a religious experience. And one day he's at Harvard and he bumps into turn on

Speaker 3:          02:56          Carolinian and drop out that guy, Timothy Leary,

Speaker 1:          03:00          he was actually a teacher at Harvard at the time and he was famously giving psychedelic drugs to Undergrad

Speaker 4:          03:08          by teaching people out of his very head. The a point is that in order to use your head have to go out of your mind.

Speaker 1:          03:16          And when Panky got a chance to talk to these students who had tripped, he noticed pretty quick that they used really similar language to the people that he'd been studying. And he started to wonder, if you put people into the right situation and you give them this drug, could you induce, actually induce a religious experience. So on that day in 1962, Pankey put 20 theological school students into this church basement, you know, during this Good Friday service, 10 of them got a placebo and then 10 of them got a hefty dose of Psilocybin, things in the room morphing. Um, which brings us back to Mike Young. You would move

Speaker 3:          03:59          of your head and there'd be an after image from the lights at one point. The visual effect was especially powerful.

Speaker 1:          04:08          And he had this one moment that has just stuck with him ever since.

Speaker 3:          04:12          I was in the middle of a technicolor's C and there were bars of color and I was floating through them and they were floating through me, uh, and it was just glorious. And the bars of color then resolved, uh, into, uh, a feel. I was at the center and there was a different color going out from me in every possible direction.

Speaker 4:          04:40          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          04:41          at first, this was quite nice. Uh, and then I realized that I had just swim out one of those color bars I had to. And each of those different color bars would be a whole different life experience. And I could choose any one of those, uh, life experience color bars that I wanted, but I had to choose one and I couldn't choose one. It was very painful. It felt like my insides were being ripped out of me and I died. And at that moment that I died, uh, I heard Howard Thurman say,

Speaker 4:          05:32          I shall die, but that is all that I shall do for death. And I stopped dying.

Speaker 1:          05:45          Wow. That's, wow. What are we supposed to make of that? Right. It is. It is strange. Yes. In fact, this is actually right around the time that this huge cultural backlash against this drug, by the end of 1962, you've got Harvard making the decision that these experiments are not going to be done at their university anymore. 63, that evil man, they fire Timothy leary. Timothy Leary, he's out of there. 1970 congress outlaws, psychedelics, 1971

Speaker 5:          06:18          nearly every country in the world, including the United States, bans them from research is their signatory to an international law banning the use sale, cultivation and possession of dangerous drugs that have no useful place in medicine.

Speaker 1:          06:35          I mean on some level, like I get that because like what could you learn from a bunch of people tripping like scientific. I mean I think that there actually is something that we can learn from this. What? Well, if you look at Mike Young on the day that he walked into that chapel, I was still a theological school student. He was, you know, he's experiencing doubts without any real confidence. That ministry was something I was going to stay in. But after this experiment at the chapel, he went home to his wife and when I walked in, my wife was very much aware that something rather unusual had occurred to this guy she was married to. Did she just, you carry yourself differently? You should never been that explicit about it. She just said she knew that, that I had had some kind of a major experience at first.

Speaker 1:          07:27          He just kind of wrote the whole thing off. But as time passed, he couldn't stop thinking about the death and the rebirth experience. And to make a long story short, if you fast forward, I'm a unitarian universalist minister, um, as a result of partly a result of that drug experience. I want to share with you this morning, a little extra. Jesus. The New Testament. That's him. Yeah. Story of the Good Samaritan. And he has, I've been preaching for 45 years here. Here's the thing that I think is really strange. All of the people who took the drug that day, those 10 who got the psilocybin and not the placebo, all but one that came. Ministers really? So nine out of 10 went into the mystery. Nine out of 10. What about the others? The Placebo Group? Yeah. None. None. Gordon to Mike. Absolutely none. Wow. That is interesting. That was the first thing.

Speaker 1:          08:28          I was like, wow, that's, that's crazy. But at the same time, you know, it's really small sample set. Who knows why anyone becomes a minister? I'm sure it wasn't just the drugs. You know, maybe they didn't even play that big of a role for everyone else, but this did make me, you know, like more curious like what exactly is happening to people when they take this drug? Yeah, and I was surprised to find out that like right now there are actually a few laboratories who are starting to experiment with these drugs. Again, we thought, well why not? This is Roland, Roland Griffis psychopharmacologist. I studied the effects of drugs on behavior. He's at Johns Hopkins and Hopkins for 40 years now. He's really well known for studying nicotine and Ritalin, but he tells me that back in 2000 he was reading about the old psilocybin studies from the 60s and this is right around the time when the Drug Enforcement Administration and the FDA were starting to loosen their rules on experimenting with psychedelics. So he applies and he gets approval.

Speaker 6:          09:30          Study about short had not been approved for 30 years and I can tell you that I've never had a protocol that was as rigorously and carefully reviewed

Speaker 1:          09:39          and scrutinized from every angle since no one had studied this drug for like three decades. He started with some really basic questions. How does this affect behavior after people have taken this drug? Like did they feel confused or afraid? Is it habit forming? And how he did his test was he has this lab room at Johns Hopkins that he's, he's made like really nice and cozy. It's a, it's a aesthetic living room, like environments. There's a couch in the stereo system and then one at a time the volunteers brought in and given a hefty dose of psilocybin blindfolded and then they're asked to lay down and direct their attention inward

Speaker 7:          10:19          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          10:19          we were bringing people in two months after sessions and asking them so well, you know, what was the session like? And they filled out some questionnaires and the thing that I really wasn't prepared for was how salient and important these experiences we're said to be on follow up. You know, they were saying, well, it was really important, you know, and I would say, well, how important? And they would say, oh, well, it was a most important experience in my life. And I'd go, what?

Speaker 7:          10:51          [inaudible]?

Speaker 6:          10:51          And they would say, yeah, you know, it's like, um, you know, like when my daughter was born, that changed my world forever. I recently lost my father and, um, and I'll never forget that. And they'll say, you know, it's kind of like that. And that's a totally improbable. So we didn't, we didn't have any metric that could even assess that.

Speaker 1:          11:15          And what made things even weirder for Rollin is that when he gave these volunteers a questionnaire,

Speaker 6:          11:19          about 75% of people are saying it's in the top five most personally meaningful and spiritually significant experiences, but their life,

Speaker 1:          11:28          a vast majority. We're talking about it like it's a spiritual experience. Huh? So rollin, he went back to look at Pankey's studies from the 1960s about the basic ingredients that make up a religious aspect.

Speaker 2:          11:42          Let me look. The characteristics of very summary list first, the characteristics of awe and wonder.

Speaker 1:          11:47          Everyone would report that they felt like they were in the presence of something great and enormous

Speaker 2:          11:52          characteristic is the of time

Speaker 1:          11:53          and space. People describe time slowing down or space getting

Speaker 2:          11:58          the third characteristic have to do with mood. Very deeply felt positive. Mood

Speaker 1:          12:03          fourth, and I'm skipping over a few

Speaker 2:          12:06          you want to do this is a sense of cosmic oneness,

Speaker 1:          12:09          this feeling of intense connection to everything around you.

Speaker 2:          12:13          The part of everything that is the whole universe and even every blade of grass and grain of sand and so forth. These are words that people use in describing anyway,

Speaker 1:          12:20          so based on this one guys, research and keep in mind, you know a lot of people have different opinions about this. Roland believes that you can actually take this little drug and from majority of people you can induce a religious experience,

Speaker 8:          12:35          but it's I you don't you, I don't know. Soon as you call it bat then I'm starting to think, hm, don't know. This is a real, a real, I mean I don't know you guys, but for someone who has to take this very seriously, because to say that you can pop a pill and then in some shortcut fashion suddenly get this experience that hit her too had been very rare and had been assigned the values of grace

Speaker 1:          13:04          to say that is to say any enormous thing. Well it sounds like, it sounds like you're not, I'm guessing how you're taking it, Robert, as to say that a d values, the thing I do, values kind of does the opposite for me. Well really, I mean when I hear the stories from, from like all the people in these studies, it reminds me like I've, I've had these like very meaningful experiences that I didn't think would last on the pill. Did you have them or no, not, not a pill. No drugs. So what happened? What, what are you talking about? Well, it goes back to like when I was a Christian, I used to be an evangelical Christian and when I was about 15 I was at a church camp and me and some of my best friends were all gathered around a campfire. It was hot in the stars for all bright and shiny.

Speaker 1:          13:57          I remember they were playing this song that I really liked. And you know that feeling that you get when when you in a crowd of people are all singing like really loud some song that you all really love. Sure. And as we're all singing this song, I remember my friend who wasn't raised in the faith like me leaning over to me and saying that like he wanted to accept Jesus and be a Christian. And he asked, well, what am I supposed to do? And I remember that being like, great, great. It's not even the word for it. Like in this one moment I got caught up in something that just felt so enormous. It's hard for me to explain how it felt like. It's hard to describe how I felt like we were all one. Like there was something powerful that was, that was like both over us but also inside of us. And so much has changed since then that sometimes I look back and I think, did that happen? Like did I hallucinate like some dude on drugs because that friend who, uh, reached over to me, he's dead now. That faith that I was a part of, I left it.

Speaker 7:          15:18          Okay.

Speaker 1:          15:19          Like all I have is this weird feeling

Speaker 7:          15:23          okay.

Speaker 1:          15:23          That I can remember. That's good. And even though you're not a Christian anymore, you, you still have that feeling. Oh yeah. But what is it about the idea that, that feeling, that campfire feeling can be triggered by a pill and that maybe that's what was happening to those folks in Rollins study? What is it about that idea that helps you? For me, like I see something concrete, you know, like I see, I see. I see something that's harder to write off. How so? Well, if I can go back into reporter mode, I will introduce you to one more guy who I think is going to help you understand what I'm talking about. Hello. This is Charlie. Charlie Busan. He's a longtime smoker. No, let's start it at 17. Smoked for 40 years. Pack a day. Breakfast, coffee, talking on the phone. Wait, why are we talking about smoking?

Speaker 1:          16:14          Well, Roland's new studies doing right now, his pilot program that he's just started a few years ago. [inaudible] is trying to see if there's something in the transformation that you have in, in the psilocybin experience that can help smokers quit smoking. What really stick with me. They gave me a pill, a a blue capsule, and he closed his eyes. And like Mike, he says he had a hallucination that changed him. The thing that I found so amazing, the one thing that was more amazing than anything else was when I was on this mountain. This is the mountain in his head. Yes. When I had traveled to the very top, uh, I was, uh, looking out over this greatness, this vista of everything he says he was just this microscopic thing. He was, he was so small and it was so big. But my experience at this one place was so exalted because he was struck by this feeling, this deep feeling that we were the same thing.

Speaker 7:          17:30          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          17:30          we were the same. This right here is another hallmark of these experiences. You're somehow confronted with this radical shift in scale and things that formerly felt like too big for you to deal with. They suddenly, they suddenly look different. We had

Speaker 6:          17:50          one person involved in her cigarette smoking study who had had a dose of Psilocybin, and in the course of that session, the idea of smoking came up to him and he said, you know, it was like a fly had landed on his arm and he just took his finger and he flicked it off and he said he was done with it. Done, done.

Speaker 1:          18:15          [inaudible] and that's exactly how it was for Charlie. The morning afterwards he says he just didn't want cigarettes anymore and they just weren't an issue anymore. Huh. And how long has he been off of it? Three years. Wow. Now this is just a tiny pilot program. I don't think that we should make too much out of it yet, but the insight I feel like is like, because, because like Charlie has this real experience, like it's not, it's not a question of like something invisible like faith, but it's like a tangible reality for me. It's like the closest thing I can come to having some kind of real evidence that what happened to me was real with a campfire. Right. To me, the mystery is you've done this occasional thing with an artificial stimulus, had a extraordinary but temporary feeling and then mysteriously it isn't temporary. It just goes on and on. Yeah. Do we have any idea why it persists? Well, Roland has a very educated hunch. I asked him about this and he's looking right now at getting in there and doing research with some new SMRI machines, but his hunch is that the silicide man drug experience, it somehow rewires the,

Speaker 6:          19:28          we're talking about rewiring a personality at a fundamental machine programming level.

Speaker 1:          19:35          Like he calls this experience a rearranging experience. Huh? You know, maybe, maybe one day science. We'll figure out what's happening in the brain of a person. That's experiencing something like this. But one of the things about this that troubles me like as a reporter and then even like personally is that going back to Walter Panky, like remember his list of ingredients from earlier, his final characteristic. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          20:02          The final characteristic that I'd like to mention here,

Speaker 1:          20:03          the final ingredient was

Speaker 2:          20:05          the characteristic of alleged enough ability, which means that the people who have such an experience claim that it can't be described in words that is nonverbal, basically indescribable.

Speaker 1:          20:13          And that's one of the main things that I'm going to take away from all this. I mean, talking to Roland and Mike and Charlie is, is just how hard it is to talk about the thing that I've just spent the last 20 minutes

Speaker 9:          20:25          trying to talk about. I understood something some life, uh, suddenly eternal truth. These words really don't match the thing. I was at the, I was feeling divine source of, um, of um, self awareness that I'd, sorry, aide said trick of words. I guess it's a got larger thanks to producer Andy Mills. Thanks to you guys for.
