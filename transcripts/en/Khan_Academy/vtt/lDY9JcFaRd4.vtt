00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.446
I've drawn a crazy looking
function here in yellow.

00:00:03.446 --> 00:00:04.820
And what I want
to think about is

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.370
when this function takes
on the maximum values

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:08.674
and minimum values.

00:00:08.674 --> 00:00:10.090
And for the sake
of this video, we

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.130
can assume that the
graph of this function

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.410
just keeps getting lower
and lower and lower

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.900
as x becomes more and more
negative, and lower and lower

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.430
and lower as x goes
beyond the interval

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.430
that I've depicted
right over here.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.580
So what is the maximum value
that this function takes on?

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:25.780
Well we can eyeball that.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.030
It looks like it's at that
point right over there.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:36.390
So we would call this
a global maximum.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.890
the?

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.020
Function never takes on
a value larger than this.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.450
So we could say that we have a
global maximum at the point x0.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:52.900
Because f of of x0 is
greater than, or equal to,

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.350
f of x, for any other
x in the domain.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.140
And that's pretty obvious,
when you look at it like this.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.070
Now do we have a
global minimum point,

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.650
the way that I've drawn it?

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:03.310
Well, no.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.070
This function can take an
arbitrarily negative values.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.672
It approaches
negative infinity as x

00:01:09.672 --> 00:01:10.880
approaches negative infinity.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.420
It approaches
negative infinity as x

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.080
approaches positive infinity.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.100
So we have-- let me
write this down--

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:24.190
we have no global minimum.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.690
Now let me ask you a question.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.630
Do we have local
minima or local maxima?

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.370
When I say minima, it's
just the plural of minimum.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.830
And maxima is just
the plural of maximum.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.430
So do we have a local minima
here, or local minimum here?

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.300
Well, a local minimum,
you could imagine means

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.180
that that value of the
function at that point

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.284
is lower than the
points around it.

00:01:47.284 --> 00:01:49.700
So right over here, it looks
like we have a local minimum.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.800
And I'm not giving a very
rigorous definition here.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.330
But one way to
think about it is,

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.940
we can say that we have a
local minimum point at x1,

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.690
as if we have a region
around x1, where f of x1

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.910
is less than an f of x for any x
in this region right over here.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.060
And it's pretty easy
to eyeball, too.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.950
This is a low point for any
of the values of f around it,

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.540
right over there.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.000
Now do we have any
other local minima?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.570
Well it doesn't look like we do.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.360
Now what about local maxima?

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.275
Well this one right over
here-- let me do it in purple,

00:02:31.275 --> 00:02:33.150
I don't want to get
people confused, actually

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.670
let me do it in this color--
this point right over here

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.590
looks like a local maximum.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.620
Not lox, that would have
to deal with salmon.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.960
Local maximum, right over there.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:53.790
So we could say at the point
x1, or sorry, at the point x2,

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.890
we have a local
maximum point at x2.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.210
Because f of x2 is larger
than f of x for any

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.814
x around a
neighborhood around x2.

00:03:03.814 --> 00:03:04.980
I'm not being very rigorous.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.280
But you can see it
just by looking at it.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.260
So that's fair enough.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.260
We've identified all of the
maxima and minima, often called

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.630
the extrema, for this function.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.270
Now how can we identify
those, if we knew something

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.434
about the derivative
of the function?

00:03:20.434 --> 00:03:21.850
Well, let's look
at the derivative

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.390
at each of these points.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.370
So at this first
point, right over here,

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.220
if I were to try to
visualize the tangent line--

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.570
let me do that in a
better color than brown.

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.240
If I were to try to
visualize the tangent line,

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.130
it would look
something like that.

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.890
So the slope here is 0.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.180
So we would say that f
prime of x0 is equal to 0.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.800
The slope of the tangent
line at this point is 0.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.140
What about over here?

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.970
Well, once again,
the tangent line

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.400
would look something like that.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:59.390
So once again, we would say
f prime at x1 is equal to 0.

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.030
What about over here?

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.910
Well, here the tangent line
is actually not well defined.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.705
We have a positive
slope going into it,

00:04:06.705 --> 00:04:09.180
and then it immediately jumps
to being a negative slope.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.034
So over here, f prime
of x2 is not defined.

00:04:14.034 --> 00:04:15.200
Let me just write undefined.

00:04:18.517 --> 00:04:21.100
So we have an interesting-- and
once again, I'm not rigorously

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.100
proving it to you, I just want
you to get the intuition here.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.870
We see that if we have
some type of an extrema--

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.820
and we're not
talking about when x

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.497
is at an endpoint
of an interval,

00:04:31.497 --> 00:04:33.830
just to be clear what I'm
talking about when I'm talking

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.032
about x as an endpoint
of an interval.

00:04:36.032 --> 00:04:37.740
We're saying, let's
say that the function

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.905
is where you have an
interval from there.

00:04:42.905 --> 00:04:45.280
So let's say a function starts
right over there, and then

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.871
keeps going.

00:04:45.871 --> 00:04:48.370
This would be a maximum point,
but it would be an end point.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.203
We're not talking about
endpoints right now.

00:04:50.203 --> 00:04:52.960
We're talking about when
we have points in between,

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.000
or when our interval
is infinite.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.540
So we're not talking
about points like that,

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:00.866
or points like this.

00:05:00.866 --> 00:05:02.615
We're talking about
the points in between.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.040
So if you have a point
inside of an interval,

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.720
it's going to be a
minimum or maximum.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.430
And we see the intuition here.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:26.030
If you have-- so non-endpoint
min or max at, let's say,

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.930
x is equal to a.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.660
So if you know that you have
a minimum or a maximum point,

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.650
at some point x is
equal to a, and x

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.399
isn't the endpoint
of some interval,

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:37.940
this tells you
something interesting.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.356
Or at least we
have the intuition.

00:05:39.356 --> 00:05:42.710
We see that the derivative
at x is equal to a

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.640
is going to be equal to 0.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.450
Or the derivative at x is equal
to a is going to be undefined.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.010
And we see that in
each of these cases.

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:58.300
Derivative is 0, derivative
is 0, derivative is undefined.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:03.600
And we have a word for these
points where the derivative is

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.600
either 0, or the
derivative is undefined.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.113
We called them critical points.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.130
So for the sake
of this function,

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:25.380
the critical points are,
we could include x sub 0,

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.580
we could include x sub 1.

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.330
At x sub 0 and x sub
1, the derivative is 0.

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:34.670
And x sub 2, where the
function is undefined.

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:38.390
Now, so if we have a
non-endpoint minimum or maximum

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:41.935
point, then it's going
to be a critical point.

00:06:41.935 --> 00:06:43.560
But can we say it
the other way around?

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.120
If we find a critical point,
where the derivative is 0,

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.830
or the derivative is
undefined, is that

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:52.670
going to be a maximum
or minimum point?

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:57.890
And to think about that, let's
imagine this point right over

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:58.520
here.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.590
So let's call this x sub 3.

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:03.690
If we look at the tangent
line right over here,

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.390
if we look at the
slope right over here,

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:10.300
it looks like f prime of
x sub 3 is equal to 0.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.290
So based on our definition
of critical point,

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:16.010
x sub 3 would also
be a critical point.

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:20.150
But it does not appear to be
a minimum or a maximum point.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:24.070
So a minimum or maximum
point that's not an endpoint,

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:25.960
it's definitely going
to be a critical point.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.800
But being a critical
point by itself

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.720
does not mean you're at a
minimum or maximum point.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.870
So just to be clear
that all of these points

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.990
were at a minimum
or maximum point.

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.527
This were at a critical
point, all of these

00:07:38.527 --> 00:07:39.360
are critical points.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.860
But this is not a
minimum or maximum point.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:43.810
In the next video, we'll
start to think about

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:47.390
how you can differentiate,
or how you can tell,

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:52.480
whether you have a minimum or
maximum at a critical point.
