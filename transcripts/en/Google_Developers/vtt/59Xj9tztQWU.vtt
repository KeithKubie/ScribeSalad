TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan

00:00:01.708 --> 00:00:02.790
for "The Developer Show."

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.650
Today we're at the
Android Dev Summit

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.549
at the Computer History Museum
in Mountain View, California,

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:09.090
just down the road
from where Android

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.310
was started 10
years ago and where

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.050
it's still developed today.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.030
As usual with these
summits, all the sessions

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.796
are recorded and
available online,

00:00:16.796 --> 00:00:18.420
but that's a ton of
content if you want

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.070
to just get the highlights.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.000
So here you are the
Android Dev Summit Top 5.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.430
Number 0, we're engineers.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.300
We get to do that.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.090
But seriously this is a
bit of a meta highlight.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.250
What struck me most
about the keynote

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.730
was how often everyone on stage
referred to developer feedback.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.860
SPEAKER 1: Your feedback.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:37.165
SPEAKER 2: The feedback.

00:00:37.165 --> 00:00:37.860
SPEAKER 3: Feedback.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:38.160
SPEAKER 4: Feedback.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.910
SPEAKER 5: Feedback.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:39.390
SPEAKER 6: Feedback.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.900
SPEAKER 7: Feedback.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.270
TIMOTHY JORDAN: This team is
amazing at taking feedback

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.940
and putting it into
the platform roadmap.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.590
In his introduction,
Dave Burke even

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.680
referred to the Android
platform as a powerful SDK

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.637
that puts developers first.

00:00:51.637 --> 00:00:53.220
And I think we saw
that throughout all

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.420
the announcements.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.120
Anyhow, number 1, app bundles.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.250
They're now stable and
available in Google Play

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.690
and, on average, apps are
seeing a 35% size savings

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.450
compared to a universal APK.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.520
Also Instant Apps
are now supported

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.590
as part of app
bundles, so you can now

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.220
upload one bundle for both
instant and installed apps.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.400
And dynamic feature modules
are now available for testing.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.230
They let you load
modules on demand

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.080
to make the core
APK even smaller.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.290
Number 2, the Google
Play in-app updates API.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.630
It allows you to trigger
updates within your app

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.120
either with a blocking flow,
where the user is expected

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.020
to apply the update right
away, or a flexible update,

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.285
where it doesn't need to
be updated immediately.

00:01:36.285 --> 00:01:38.940
Now some of us have built
similar flows on our own

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.890
before, but this is a
standard implementation,

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.730
which is easier to use.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.280
Now for number 3, Kotlin 1.3.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.310
Kotlin became a first-class
language for Android last year,

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.590
and it's an awesome way
to develop for Android.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.510
This latest version
includes new features

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.540
such as inline classes,
unsigned numbers,

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.330
and perhaps most importantly,
coroutines support

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.040
is now stable.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.620
If you haven't had a chance
to dig in with Kotlin yet,

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.420
there's one more thing
they unveiled for it

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.190
at the summit
that'll interest you,

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.860
a preview of the new
Udacity course on Android

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.670
app development in Kotlin
using Jetpack as well as

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.450
other popular
third-party libraries.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.770
Fourth on our list is the
updates to Android Jetpack.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.220
I think it's so
cool that it's now

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.770
being developed in
the open on public

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.580
AOSP, which means we can
all now see features and bug

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.430
fixes as they're
developed and contribute

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.170
to any of the libraries.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.300
Also the Architecture
Components libraries

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.910
that were announced
at I/O with Jetpack

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.520
will be in beta
later this month.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.070
Work manager is for
background tasks,

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.520
and navigation uses
integrated tooling in studio

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.370
to simplify in-app navigation.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.080
Our last one, number 5.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.690
You know it has to
be foldable devices.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.700
These are very cool
and totally make sense

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.380
on Android, which
is a platform that

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.120
has supported
different screen sizes

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.480
and densities for a long time.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.830
The killer feature here
is screen continuity,

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.170
which means starting an
experience on the folded

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.960
smaller screen,
and as you unfold,

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.780
it seamlessly transfers
to the bigger screen.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.550
The team is adding
resizable flags

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.000
so apps can respond to
folding and unfolding.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.870
That's it, your Android
Dev Summit Top 5.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.560
