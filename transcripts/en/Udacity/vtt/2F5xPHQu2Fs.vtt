00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.011
Hopefully you marked
presenting the keyboard,

00:00:04.011 --> 00:00:08.759
behavior of the cursor, font and
layout, and rounded corners.

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:12.724
These behaviors are similar across all
three text fields, because they're

00:00:12.724 --> 00:00:16.470
encoded in the UITextField object,
in other words, the view.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.710
Apart from their content,
the text fields look identical.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.950
So what governs these
differences between them?

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.080
Their unique behaviors come from
the delegate, in other words,

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.890
the control object.
