the problem that everybody was facing
 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.860
the problem that everybody was facing
with atomic clocks was that the atoms

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870
with atomic clocks was that the atoms
 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.360
with atomic clocks was that the atoms
were moving at approximately the speed

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370
were moving at approximately the speed
 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.160
were moving at approximately the speed
of sound and it wasn't so easy to

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170
of sound and it wasn't so easy to
 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.289
of sound and it wasn't so easy to
measure the ticking frequency so we said

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299
measure the ticking frequency so we said
 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.620
measure the ticking frequency so we said
let's cool them down using lasers so

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630
let's cool them down using lasers so
 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.509
let's cool them down using lasers so
they're going more slowly and that will

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519
they're going more slowly and that will
 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.100
they're going more slowly and that will
make it easier to measure the ticking

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110
make it easier to measure the ticking
 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.690
make it easier to measure the ticking
frequency and you can make better clocks

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700
frequency and you can make better clocks
 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.229
frequency and you can make better clocks

very best clocks were accurate to a part
 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.500
very best clocks were accurate to a part
in 10 to the 13 so that's one part / one

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510
in 10 to the 13 so that's one part / one
 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.680
in 10 to the 13 so that's one part / one
