00:00:00.261 --> 00:00:01.294
 What I want to do in this video 

00:00:01.294 --> 00:00:04.893
 Is to review some of the techniques to do mental gathering. 

00:00:04.893 --> 00:00:08.318
 Now, if you see something like 355 plus 480, 

00:00:08.318 --> 00:00:10.152
 If you have some paper around, you can 

00:00:10.153 --> 00:00:13.612
 Writing these numbers and doing your traditional way of combining, 

00:00:13.612 --> 00:00:15.551
 But you may be able to do it in your mind, 

00:00:15.551 --> 00:00:17.386
 So how do you do it? 

00:00:17.386 --> 00:00:18.953
 Well, way of thinking about it, 

00:00:18.953 --> 00:00:21.855
 Can we add or subtract these numbers? 

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:23.574
 So it becomes one of these numbers 

00:00:23.574 --> 00:00:26.230
 A little simpler? 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.626
 If for example, I have 480 here. 

00:00:27.626 --> 00:00:29.727
 What should I do for 

00:00:29.727 --> 00:00:31.120
 So, to say, we get 500? 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.560
 It's almost 500. 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.200
 Well, I can add 20 to 480, but I can not add only 20. 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.510
 I will also have to subtract 20, 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.200
 So what happens if you subtract 20 of 355 and add it 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.251
 To 480? 

00:00:44.251 --> 00:00:45.806
 So what am I talking about? 

00:00:45.807 --> 00:00:47.455
 If this will be the same thing as, 

00:00:47.455 --> 00:00:50.416
 So let me subtract 20 from this. 

00:00:50.416 --> 00:00:55.130
 If those will become 335 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.920
 And let me add 20 to these, 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.157
 If 480 Plus 20 equals 500, 

00:01:00.157 --> 00:01:03.930
 The reason I put 20 and 20 added 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:04.718
 I said, well, what should I add to 480? 

00:01:04.718 --> 00:01:06.217
 To get 500? 

00:01:06.217 --> 00:01:07.227
 I could have done it in my mind. 

00:01:07.227 --> 00:01:08.493
 Well, I need 20 extra. 

00:01:08.493 --> 00:01:11.384
 355 Less than 20 equals 335. 

00:01:11.384 --> 00:01:14.623
 But now this issue is much easier to reckon with. 

00:01:14.623 --> 00:01:17.386
 335 plus 500, 

00:01:17.386 --> 00:01:20.253
 Well, the output would be three hundred plus five hundred, 

00:01:20.254 --> 00:01:22.785
 Will be equal to 

00:01:22.785 --> 00:01:27.487
 800 and then our 35. 

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:29.588
 835. 

00:01:29.588 --> 00:01:32.140
 Now, to make what we've done a little clearer, 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.186
 Remember, we wanted to subtract 20 from here 

00:01:34.186 --> 00:01:35.718
 And we set it here, 

00:01:35.718 --> 00:01:38.690
 If we can divide 355, 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.221
 We could have said it would equal, 

00:01:41.221 --> 00:01:42.382
 Will equal, 

00:01:42.382 --> 00:01:46.411
 Let's make it to 335 

00:01:46.411 --> 00:01:48.118
 And 20, remember, 

00:01:48.118 --> 00:01:49.789
 The reason why optional 20 is due 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.251
 I'll add it to 480, 

00:01:52.251 --> 00:01:54.561
 But I will take it step by step here, 

00:01:54.561 --> 00:01:59.124
 If plus 480, 

00:01:59.124 --> 00:02:02.827
 And now I can change the order with any number will add, 

00:02:02.827 --> 00:02:05.660
 If I can say, this would be equal 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.223
 335 

00:02:09.223 --> 00:02:10.953
 Plus 20 

00:02:10.954 --> 00:02:15.510
 Plus 480, 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.125
 Instead of collecting 335 and 20 first, 

00:02:17.126 --> 00:02:19.506
 I can collect the 20 and 480 first, 

00:02:19.506 --> 00:02:24.570
 If I can combine these two numbers first, 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:25.983
 And so I will have, 

00:02:25.984 --> 00:02:28.921
 This will be equal to 335 

00:02:28.921 --> 00:02:31.661
 Plus, what is the output of 20 plus 480? 

00:02:31.661 --> 00:02:32.486
 Well, that was the whole idea. 

00:02:32.486 --> 00:02:34.587
 I chose 20 to get 500. 

00:02:34.587 --> 00:02:38.406
 20 Plus 480 equals 500 

00:02:38.407 --> 00:02:40.555
 And then, now, you can bring them together. 

00:02:40.555 --> 00:02:43.887
 This will be 835. 

00:02:43.887 --> 00:02:47.288
 If this is just a longer way to explain what you've done here. 

00:02:47.288 --> 00:02:49.518
 I took 20 of 355, 

00:02:49.518 --> 00:02:52.316
 So i can convert 480 to 500. 

00:02:52.316 --> 00:02:54.858
 Let's do a few other examples of these, 

00:02:54.858 --> 00:02:56.658
 And remember, the key is just thinking about 

00:02:56.658 --> 00:02:59.989
 How to combine or subtract from a setup 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.395
 To make them simpler? 

00:03:01.395 --> 00:03:04.123
 If here, I have 18 plus 704. 

00:03:04.123 --> 00:03:05.992
 So there are several ways we deal with this. 

00:03:05.992 --> 00:03:08.987
 One way, we can try to make 704 equal 

00:03:08.987 --> 00:03:10.984
 700. 

00:03:10.984 --> 00:03:14.990
 So, we can say that this is the same thing as 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.625
 18 plus, 

00:03:17.625 --> 00:03:21.515
 I can write 700 plus 4, 

00:03:21.515 --> 00:03:23.452
 Or I can write it as 4 

00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:26.553
 Plus 700, so, 

00:03:26.553 --> 00:03:30.489
 And then I can put brackets around this first, 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.206
 And then I can only change the order that I collect, 

00:03:33.206 --> 00:03:36.480
 If this is the same thing as 18 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.155
 Plus 4 

00:03:40.155 --> 00:03:42.855
 Plus 700, 

00:03:42.855 --> 00:03:45.994
 Now I can collect 18 and 4 first. 

00:03:45.995 --> 00:03:47.852
 Now what is the result of 18 plus 4? 

00:03:47.852 --> 00:03:52.392
 He 22, and then I have 700, 

00:03:52.392 --> 00:03:56.595
 And now these are easier to calculate more, 

00:03:56.595 --> 00:03:58.487
 All these will be equal to each other, 

00:03:58.487 --> 00:03:59.892
 So let me just type it like this. 

00:03:59.892 --> 00:04:01.959
 22 plus 700, I can do it in my mind. 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.455
 That would be 722. 

00:04:04.455 --> 00:04:05.360
 Now, know what you're thinking. 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.253
 Well, this is supposed to be a technique to do something 

00:04:07.253 --> 00:04:07.971
 in my mind? 

00:04:07.972 --> 00:04:10.260
 I can not write all this stuff in my mind. 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.792
 The reason for my writing is this way 

00:04:11.792 --> 00:04:14.161
 Is to see what really happens. 

00:04:14.161 --> 00:04:15.658
 But you can do it more quickly. 

00:04:15.658 --> 00:04:18.421
 You can only say, well, let me take 4 of the, 

00:04:18.421 --> 00:04:21.394
 I close my eyes now as I speak, 

00:04:21.394 --> 00:04:23.483
 Just to appear I was in my mind. 

00:04:23.483 --> 00:04:26.920
 Well, let me collect 4 to 18 and subtract 4 out of 700, 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.892
 Well that would be the same if you collected 4 to 18, 

00:04:29.892 --> 00:04:31.761
 This will be 22, 

00:04:31.761 --> 00:04:34.600
 And if you subtract 4 from 704, 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.951
 That would be a plus of 700. 

00:04:36.951 --> 00:04:40.620
 22 plus 700 is 722. 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.580
 Now, there is another way to solve it. 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:44.927
 You can say, well, let me in fact, 

00:04:44.927 --> 00:04:47.354
 Instead of subtracting 4, let me add some numbers, 

00:04:47.354 --> 00:04:48.654
 Some values ​​here, so get, 

00:04:48.654 --> 00:04:50.361
 I do not know, to say 710. 

00:04:50.361 --> 00:04:52.288
 So it seems less perfect to me, 

00:04:52.288 --> 00:04:53.228
 But you can do it. 

00:04:53.228 --> 00:04:55.620
 Well, let's see, if I collected 6 to 704, 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.222
 I will arrive at 710. 

00:04:57.222 --> 00:04:59.183
 So what if you took 6 out of 18 

00:04:59.184 --> 00:05:01.251
 And collected it to 704? 

00:05:01.251 --> 00:05:02.423
 If I can write it like this. 

00:05:02.423 --> 00:05:06.951
 I can say that 18 are 12 plus 6 

00:05:06.951 --> 00:05:11.405
 And then 704 plus 

00:05:11.405 --> 00:05:16.590
 This is the same as 12 plus 6 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.727
 Plus 704, 

00:05:20.727 --> 00:05:22.816
 And then I can collect these first, 

00:05:22.817 --> 00:05:27.925
 I can get 12 plus 710 

00:05:27.925 --> 00:05:30.317
 And I might say, 

00:05:30.317 --> 00:05:32.360
 Well, that would be 722, 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.951
 But this way here does not seem 

00:05:33.951 --> 00:05:36.818
 Very close to being as intuitive as doing these, 

00:05:36.818 --> 00:05:41.183
 Try to convert 704 to 700 

00:05:41.184 --> 00:05:43.854
 Take 4 here and add it 

00:05:43.854 --> 00:05:45.455
 Here. 

00:05:45.456 --> 00:05:48.986
 Let's do another example of this. 

00:05:48.986 --> 00:05:52.353
 If 275 plus 595. 

00:05:52.353 --> 00:05:53.815
 Well, my instinctive reaction is, 

00:05:53.815 --> 00:05:57.461
 Can we convert 595 to be equal to 600? 

00:05:57.461 --> 00:05:58.320
 If these will be equal to, 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.918
 So if you collect 5 to 595, it will produce 600. 

00:06:02.918 --> 00:06:04.694
 Let me do the same thing. 

00:06:04.694 --> 00:06:07.724
 If I will collect 5 her to get 600. 

00:06:07.724 --> 00:06:10.522
 I have a problem converting colors. 

00:06:10.522 --> 00:06:12.589
 If, 600, 

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:13.610
 But I can not only collect 5, 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.352
 Ali also has to subtract 5 from here, 

00:06:15.352 --> 00:06:19.659
 If subtracting 5 from there, that would be 270, 

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:22.620
 If these become 270 plus 600, 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.559
 And this is easier to calculate in my mind for me. 

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:27.647
 These will be two hundred plus six hundred 

00:06:27.647 --> 00:06:30.120
 Worth eight hundred. 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.186
 I have seven scores plus zero ten, 

00:06:32.186 --> 00:06:33.823
 If 800, then I have no one. 

00:06:33.823 --> 00:06:35.587
 870. 

00:06:35.588 --> 00:06:37.492
 Now, another way you can try to solve 

00:06:37.492 --> 00:06:41.560
 Like, let's try to convert these 275 into, 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.752
 Let's try to convert it to 300. 

00:06:42.752 --> 00:06:46.490
 So, we can say this is the same 300. 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.321
 We can say the same thing as 300. 

00:06:50.321 --> 00:06:53.840
 And to get to it, I just added 25, 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.230
 But if I add 25 of this number, I will have to 

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.519
 Take 25 of this number. 

00:06:57.519 --> 00:07:01.490
 If I can ask 25 from here, 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.554
 And then I will get 300 plus 95 minus 25 

00:07:05.554 --> 00:07:06.621
 70, 

00:07:06.622 --> 00:07:08.723
 If this would be 570. 

00:07:08.723 --> 00:07:12.218
 570, and these are also easy to calculate. 

00:07:12.218 --> 00:07:15.794
 300 plus 570 equals 870. 

00:07:15.794 --> 00:07:17.325
 There are other ways you can use to solve these 

00:07:17.326 --> 00:07:19.439
 The traditional method involves writing them on paper 

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:20.472
 And so on. 

00:07:20.472 --> 00:07:22.794
 But I hope this gives you a few tools 

00:07:22.794 --> 00:07:26.376
 In order to have the ability to solve these things in your mind.
