00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.520
this program is brought to you by Emory

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:02.530
this program is brought to you by Emory
 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:08.850
this program is brought to you by Emory
University

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:08.860
 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.860
the progress

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:10.870
the progress
 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.750
the progress
in let enormously because of the

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:15.760
in let enormously because of the
 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.870
in let enormously because of the
development of the treatment and the

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:18.880
development of the treatment and the
 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.850
development of the treatment and the
development of the test of course that

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:20.860
development of the test of course that
 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.370
development of the test of course that
was a first step if people are not

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380
was a first step if people are not
 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.730
was a first step if people are not
tested and found HIV positive they

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740
tested and found HIV positive they
 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.490
tested and found HIV positive they
cannot have access to the treatment so

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500
cannot have access to the treatment so
 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.670
cannot have access to the treatment so
and as I said as a treatment today is

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680
and as I said as a treatment today is
 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.549
and as I said as a treatment today is
not on your benefit for the patient and

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559
not on your benefit for the patient and
 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.420
not on your benefit for the patient and
we learned that if a patient is treated

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430
we learned that if a patient is treated
 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.579
we learned that if a patient is treated
very early the benefit in terms of

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:44.589
very early the benefit in terms of
 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:49.139
very early the benefit in terms of
survival is even much better than if a

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149
survival is even much better than if a
 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:53.060
survival is even much better than if a
patient is treated late so of course

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070
patient is treated late so of course
 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.459
patient is treated late so of course
everyone has to be tested as early as

00:00:56.459 --> 00:00:56.469
everyone has to be tested as early as
 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:59.790
everyone has to be tested as early as
possible to get benefit of the treatment

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800
possible to get benefit of the treatment
 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.579
possible to get benefit of the treatment
we learned also that the treatment is

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:02.589
we learned also that the treatment is
 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:06.060
we learned also that the treatment is
not a benefit at individual level for

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070
not a benefit at individual level for
 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.310
not a benefit at individual level for
the patients that I chai Li positi but

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320
the patients that I chai Li positi but
 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.310
the patients that I chai Li positi but
we learned during the last years that

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320
we learned during the last years that
 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.440
we learned during the last years that
the treatment is very important for

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450
the treatment is very important for
 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.730
the treatment is very important for
prevention as well recently as it has

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740
prevention as well recently as it has
 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.020
prevention as well recently as it has
been a very nice data published by Myron

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030

discordant couple if the partner

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810
discordant couple if the partner
 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.230
discordant couple if the partner
positive partner is treated very early

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240
positive partner is treated very early
 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.290
positive partner is treated very early
then there is a reduction of the risk of

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300
then there is a reduction of the risk of
 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.490
then there is a reduction of the risk of
transmission to the negative partner by

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500
transmission to the negative partner by
 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:50.080
transmission to the negative partner by
ninety-six percent

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090
 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.810
