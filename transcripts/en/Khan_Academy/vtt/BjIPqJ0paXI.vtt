00:00:00.322 --> 00:00:02.412
- [Voiceover] Hello
grammarians and historians

00:00:02.412 --> 00:00:04.386
and linguists and friends.

00:00:04.386 --> 00:00:06.286
David here along with Jake.

00:00:06.286 --> 00:00:07.119
- [Jake] Hey.

00:00:07.119 --> 00:00:08.576
- [David] And Paige.
- [Paige] Hello.

00:00:08.576 --> 00:00:11.224
- [David] And I want to
continue our discussion

00:00:11.224 --> 00:00:15.195
of the history of the
apostrophe, in English,

00:00:15.195 --> 00:00:17.633
and what I'm having Jake
draw for me right now

00:00:17.633 --> 00:00:20.675
is an old English King because what's...

00:00:20.675 --> 00:00:24.320
The story of the possessive
apostrophe, in English,

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.237
is really the story of old English.

00:00:28.554 --> 00:00:32.878
Like, how did we get this
like Paige's and Jake's?

00:00:32.878 --> 00:00:36.171
How did we get that ending
up as our possessive form,

00:00:36.171 --> 00:00:38.186
in English, with that apostrophe s.

00:00:38.186 --> 00:00:41.015
Because it didn't always
used to be that way.

00:00:41.015 --> 00:00:43.802
It didn't always used to be apostrophe s.

00:00:43.802 --> 00:00:46.038
Oh, that's very nice, Jake.

00:00:46.038 --> 00:00:47.788
- [Jake] Well, I try.

00:00:51.337 --> 00:00:52.695
- [David] So, that's King Ethelred.

00:00:52.695 --> 00:00:56.445
So, okay, when we're
talking about, you know,

00:00:59.217 --> 00:01:02.064
the possessive in English is very strange

00:01:02.064 --> 00:01:05.222
because it's this relic from history

00:01:05.222 --> 00:01:08.722
of these forms left over from old English.

00:01:10.064 --> 00:01:13.477
So, here's this table, this
vastly simplified table.

00:01:13.477 --> 00:01:17.784
English used to have these
things called case endings.

00:01:17.784 --> 00:01:19.909
And this is not a very, this is like

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:21.639
a super-simplified version.

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:25.064
These are all, what are called,
the strong case endings.

00:01:25.064 --> 00:01:28.187
They were strong and weak
case endings for each gender,

00:01:28.187 --> 00:01:31.914
and, in English, we have
masculine, feminine, and neuter.

00:01:31.914 --> 00:01:34.153
But the important thing to remember, is

00:01:34.153 --> 00:01:37.126
that the singular form of the neuter

00:01:37.126 --> 00:01:38.961
and the masculine was es,

00:01:38.961 --> 00:01:41.286
and that just sounds like
gobbledyook right now, I get it.

00:01:41.286 --> 00:01:44.777
So, let's take our king,
which in old English

00:01:44.777 --> 00:01:47.277
would have been cyning, right,

00:01:48.864 --> 00:01:51.500
and so if we're gonna look this crown.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.123
Well, in old English, they
would have just used the Latin,

00:01:54.123 --> 00:01:56.941
corona, so we're just gonna
refer to this as a hat.

00:01:56.941 --> 00:01:59.099
So, if we want to talk
about the king's hat,

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:01.865
in old English, we would use

00:02:01.865 --> 00:02:04.365
the special possessive ending,

00:02:06.627 --> 00:02:08.973
the masculine possessive ending, right,

00:02:08.973 --> 00:02:11.306
because English had a
million of these endings.

00:02:11.306 --> 00:02:13.651
There was one where if you
were the subject of a sentence,

00:02:13.651 --> 00:02:14.601
you would use that ending.

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:16.021
If you were the object of a sentence,

00:02:16.021 --> 00:02:17.134
you would use that ending.

00:02:17.134 --> 00:02:19.352
The Norman Invasion lopped all those off

00:02:19.352 --> 00:02:20.838
along with a bunch English heads,

00:02:20.838 --> 00:02:22.893
and now we have a much
more simplified language

00:02:22.893 --> 00:02:24.367
for better or worse.

00:02:24.367 --> 00:02:27.595
If we're talking about the king, here,

00:02:27.595 --> 00:02:30.095
we can refer to this guy's hat

00:02:32.065 --> 00:02:33.565
as secyninges haet

00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:37.463
which might not be the most accurate,

00:02:37.463 --> 00:02:40.587
but, you know, Beowulf
isn't around to correct me.

00:02:40.587 --> 00:02:43.895
So, if we're looking at
this cyning, here, right,

00:02:43.895 --> 00:02:46.066
the possessive ending is this es.

00:02:46.066 --> 00:02:47.041
If, for example, we had,

00:02:47.041 --> 00:02:50.482
and I'm gonna draw a queen
that's not gonna be as nice,

00:02:50.482 --> 00:02:52.638
Queen Pun Hilda.

00:02:52.638 --> 00:02:54.791
So the difference between...

00:02:54.791 --> 00:02:56.864
So, okay, so the old English word

00:02:56.864 --> 00:03:00.531
for queen was, perhaps
unsurprisingly, cwen,

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.944
and if we're gonna talk
about the queen's hat,

00:03:04.944 --> 00:03:09.310
we would use this singular,
strong, feminine genitive ending

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.060
which is cwene, right, with an e.

00:03:13.071 --> 00:03:14.488
So, secwene haet,

00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:17.889
and that's where all of this started.

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:22.069
Okay, so we have this really
ludicrously complicated system.

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:24.298
Even this table is simplified, right?

00:03:24.298 --> 00:03:27.412
Like I've left out half of it,

00:03:27.412 --> 00:03:29.267
but, ultimately, what it boils down to

00:03:29.267 --> 00:03:32.239
is secyninges haet, secwene haet.

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.341
And as we move through history,

00:03:34.341 --> 00:03:35.874
what happens is the French invade,

00:03:35.874 --> 00:03:38.427
and they say, "Uh, this
system is very complicated.

00:03:38.427 --> 00:03:40.982
"Let us get rid of it," and they do,

00:03:40.982 --> 00:03:42.340
and it basically leaves us with,

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.395
by the time we get to middle English,

00:03:44.395 --> 00:03:45.765
the following.

00:03:45.765 --> 00:03:46.787
So, by the time we get to middle English,

00:03:46.787 --> 00:03:48.870
we have the kinges hatte,

00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:54.507
and we have the quenes hatte.

00:03:54.507 --> 00:03:57.816
And what's happened is this old English

00:03:57.816 --> 00:04:00.191
masculine and neuter genitive,

00:04:00.191 --> 00:04:03.349
this possessive form, has just become

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:05.436
the norm for everything.

00:04:05.436 --> 00:04:08.294
Everything is now masculine-ized.

00:04:08.294 --> 00:04:09.808
For better or worse, that's like,

00:04:09.808 --> 00:04:13.745
everything has been
simplified in that direction.

00:04:13.745 --> 00:04:15.266
That's part one.

00:04:15.266 --> 00:04:17.286
Okay, so hold that in your head.

00:04:17.286 --> 00:04:18.119
Okay.

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:22.116
Then, so (laughs) that's middle English,

00:04:22.116 --> 00:04:25.699
And then, the printing
press gets invented.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.535
Now, all of the sudden,
people are writing texts

00:04:29.535 --> 00:04:31.148
in English all over the place,

00:04:31.148 --> 00:04:33.900
but nobody knows how to spell yet, right?

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.187
So, we've got that possessive form,

00:04:36.187 --> 00:04:40.158
and then we have, what's
called, the his possessive.

00:04:40.158 --> 00:04:42.282
So, at this point, we're
in modern English, right,

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:45.185
and so some bit of middle
English and old English

00:04:45.185 --> 00:04:47.092
have fallen away.

00:04:47.092 --> 00:04:48.759
But so, for example,

00:04:50.234 --> 00:04:54.484
we're still looking at something
like, "The kinges hat,"

00:04:54.484 --> 00:04:57.271
but what we're starting
to see in this one weird

00:04:57.271 --> 00:05:00.638
little period between like the late-16th

00:05:00.638 --> 00:05:02.867
and early-17th centuries.

00:05:02.867 --> 00:05:04.887
This brief fad for this thing,

00:05:04.887 --> 00:05:07.220
where people went, "the king

00:05:08.823 --> 00:05:09.656
"his hat."

00:05:11.168 --> 00:05:13.668
And, if you can imagine, like,

00:05:14.812 --> 00:05:17.867
post-Elizabethan era Londoner saying this,

00:05:17.867 --> 00:05:21.153
it kind of sounds the same, to my mind,

00:05:21.153 --> 00:05:23.521
"The kinges hat," "the king his hat,"

00:05:23.521 --> 00:05:25.239
right, like you're losing...

00:05:25.239 --> 00:05:27.434
This 'h' is kind of swallowed.

00:05:27.434 --> 00:05:28.583
- [Jake] So, nobody knew how to spell

00:05:28.583 --> 00:05:30.402
because there was no way to spell.

00:05:30.402 --> 00:05:32.898
- [David] Right, like, Samuel
Johnson had not yet written

00:05:32.898 --> 00:05:35.378
the first dictionary,
and that's like 1720.

00:05:35.378 --> 00:05:37.658
- [Jake] Uh-huh.
[David] I'm pretty sure.

00:05:37.658 --> 00:05:40.932
There were no standards,
not because people were dumb

00:05:40.932 --> 00:05:42.337
or anything, certainly not.

00:05:42.337 --> 00:05:45.367
It's just that these
standards didn't exist.

00:05:45.367 --> 00:05:48.699
Like, in the great scheme of history,

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:50.824
there's stuff that we do now, you know,

00:05:50.824 --> 00:05:53.482
that 400 years from now
people are gonna look back

00:05:53.482 --> 00:05:56.791
at us and be like, "Phh, you
used words to communicate?"

00:05:56.791 --> 00:05:59.740
You know, like we have no idea.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.823
So, what starts to happen

00:06:02.731 --> 00:06:04.407
is this thing,

00:06:04.407 --> 00:06:07.424
the king his hat, becomes
more and more common

00:06:07.424 --> 00:06:09.980
to the point where people
just sort of understand it

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.147
as a given, and it starts to
get collapsed to save space.

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:17.315
So, the king his hat

00:06:17.315 --> 00:06:19.982
becomes the king's hat, like so.

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.604
And just this one weird, fad usage,

00:06:24.604 --> 00:06:27.685
which you could even argue
is like a folk entomology,

00:06:27.685 --> 00:06:28.707
or something made up.

00:06:28.707 --> 00:06:29.540
It doesn't matter.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:30.669
It happened.

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:34.216
It's attested in print, and
this is how it was collapsed,

00:06:34.216 --> 00:06:36.590
and, what happened as
a result of this usage,

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.982
is the same thing happened to this.

00:06:38.982 --> 00:06:41.273
So, the kinges hat became

00:06:41.273 --> 00:06:44.857
the king's hat, and it
was just well, frankly,

00:06:44.857 --> 00:06:48.119
because if you were talking
about the queen's hat,

00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:51.358
in this his possessive context, it just...

00:06:51.358 --> 00:06:54.858
You'd either have to do the Queen her hat,

00:06:56.176 --> 00:06:57.558
which is fine, I suppose,

00:06:57.558 --> 00:06:59.324
or the Queen his hat,

00:06:59.324 --> 00:07:02.539
which doesn't make a ton of sense.

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:04.141
- [Jake] And if you're
wondering how there can be just

00:07:04.141 --> 00:07:07.995
this random change in sound in a language

00:07:07.995 --> 00:07:09.957
without anybody orchestrating it,

00:07:09.957 --> 00:07:11.885
think of a time where say something like,

00:07:11.885 --> 00:07:13.986
"I'm gonna go to the store."

00:07:13.986 --> 00:07:15.135
"I'm gonna..."

00:07:15.135 --> 00:07:16.494
What are you really saying there?

00:07:16.494 --> 00:07:19.002
It's a contraction of, I am going to.

00:07:19.002 --> 00:07:22.612
Nobody actually says, "I
am going to go right now."

00:07:22.612 --> 00:07:24.133
They say, "I'm gonna go."

00:07:24.133 --> 00:07:26.316
So, words are always kind of mashing

00:07:26.316 --> 00:07:27.674
into each other.

00:07:27.674 --> 00:07:29.439
- [David] If you remember
from an earlier video

00:07:29.439 --> 00:07:31.831
when Paige and I were
discussing the principle

00:07:31.831 --> 00:07:34.431
of least effort, that's
what Jake is getting at.

00:07:34.431 --> 00:07:35.952
Is, "the tongue is lazy."

00:07:35.952 --> 00:07:38.611
Don't feel bad, but "the tongue is lazy."

00:07:38.611 --> 00:07:41.432
Yeah, so what happened was, you know,

00:07:41.432 --> 00:07:43.099
this thing became...

00:07:46.436 --> 00:07:50.113
And pretty soon,
everything became this way.

00:07:50.113 --> 00:07:52.529
So, because of this
one strange little fad,

00:07:52.529 --> 00:07:54.255
what we call the Saxon possessive,

00:07:54.255 --> 00:07:56.392
this thing, the kinges, the cwenes,

00:07:56.392 --> 00:07:58.729
eventually just became king's

00:07:58.729 --> 00:08:01.063
and queen's, like so.

00:08:01.063 --> 00:08:03.290
- [Jake] How elegant.
- [David] Thank you.

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:05.520
Jake, Paige, does this square with how...

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.221
I mean, this is how apostrophes
are used in English,

00:08:08.221 --> 00:08:09.637
but Jake and Paige,
you all were telling me

00:08:09.637 --> 00:08:13.121
about all the many ways
that apostrophes are used

00:08:13.121 --> 00:08:15.737
in other languages around the world.

00:08:15.737 --> 00:08:17.436
- [Jake] Right, well I think, you know,

00:08:17.436 --> 00:08:20.302
punctuation marks are tools
just like any other tools

00:08:20.302 --> 00:08:21.376
that human beings use.

00:08:21.376 --> 00:08:22.467
- [David] Uh-huh.
- [Jake] And they can be used

00:08:22.467 --> 00:08:23.658
different ways in different languages.

00:08:23.658 --> 00:08:26.491
So, in Dutch, apostrophes are used

00:08:27.591 --> 00:08:28.659
to make plurals.

00:08:28.659 --> 00:08:29.492
- [David] What?!?!

00:08:29.492 --> 00:08:31.053
- [Jake] For words that end in a vowel.

00:08:31.053 --> 00:08:32.361
- [Jake] So.
- [David] Okay.

00:08:32.361 --> 00:08:34.571
- [Jake] Photo in Dutch, is f-o-t-o,

00:08:34.571 --> 00:08:36.252
and if you want to have
multiple photos, well,

00:08:36.252 --> 00:08:37.085
you have to throw in an apostrophe.

00:08:37.085 --> 00:08:38.974
You have to throw in an apostrophe

00:08:38.974 --> 00:08:40.057
before the s.

00:08:41.057 --> 00:08:42.442
No good reason why that's the case.

00:08:42.442 --> 00:08:44.868
That's just how they do it.

00:08:44.868 --> 00:08:48.607
Conversely, Dutch does
not put an apostrophe

00:08:48.607 --> 00:08:50.001
for possession.

00:08:50.001 --> 00:08:52.671
So, if you wanted to say, Jan's book,

00:08:52.671 --> 00:08:55.109
you would just say J-a-n-s.

00:08:55.109 --> 00:08:58.685
- [David] Oh, so it kind
of retains this genitive.

00:08:58.685 --> 00:09:00.879
It retains this possessive form.

00:09:00.879 --> 00:09:01.712
- [Jake] Right.

00:09:01.712 --> 00:09:02.922
Same thing with German.

00:09:02.922 --> 00:09:05.999
- [David] So how do we say, "Jan's book?"

00:09:05.999 --> 00:09:08.460
Jans book, like that?

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.126
- [Jake] Uh-hum.
- [David] Okay.

00:09:10.126 --> 00:09:11.166
- [Jake] Same thing with German.

00:09:11.166 --> 00:09:13.186
German is a little bit more conservative,

00:09:13.186 --> 00:09:14.649
and that it retains the es.

00:09:14.649 --> 00:09:17.470
So, "Das Buch" might mean the book,

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:20.263
in German, and if you want
to say, "Of the book,"

00:09:20.263 --> 00:09:22.122
or if you want to say, "The book's,"

00:09:22.122 --> 00:09:25.807
you'd say "Des Buches" with that es ending

00:09:25.807 --> 00:09:29.293
tagged onto "Buch".

00:09:29.293 --> 00:09:33.387
- [David] Oh, the same
one as in old English.

00:09:33.387 --> 00:09:35.129
- [Jake] Right, so
since English is kind of

00:09:35.129 --> 00:09:36.510
a cousin language to German.

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:37.343
- [David] Uh-huh.

00:09:37.343 --> 00:09:40.179
- [Jake] You can see
which way the ball fell

00:09:40.179 --> 00:09:41.328
on these two languages.

00:09:41.328 --> 00:09:44.730
- [David] Wow! That's super cool.

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:46.611
Paige, any insights from Danish?

00:09:46.611 --> 00:09:48.358
- [Paige] Yeah, so from my limited,

00:09:48.358 --> 00:09:51.529
you know, expertise in Danish,

00:09:51.529 --> 00:09:52.761
people who speak Danish tend

00:09:52.761 --> 00:09:55.794
to abbreviate like all their words.

00:09:55.794 --> 00:09:58.000
Like, everything gets
shortened all the time.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.366
- [David] Sure.

00:09:59.366 --> 00:10:02.165
- [Paige] So, the
apostrophe is sometimes used

00:10:02.165 --> 00:10:04.513
in a similar way to how it is here

00:10:04.513 --> 00:10:06.638
to sort of show what's being shortened.

00:10:06.638 --> 00:10:07.471
- [David] Okay.

00:10:07.471 --> 00:10:09.053
- [Paige] So in Danish,
to say something like,

00:10:09.053 --> 00:10:09.970
"Take me with you."

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:10.803
- [David] Uh-huh.

00:10:10.803 --> 00:10:12.838
- [Paige] You would say,
"tag mig med"

00:10:12.838 --> 00:10:14.440
- [David] Tag mig med

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.698
- [Paige] So then, you can
shorten that first word,

00:10:17.698 --> 00:10:20.499
in writing, by getting rid of the g

00:10:20.499 --> 00:10:22.079
and adding an apostrophe.

00:10:22.079 --> 00:10:22.912
- [David] Okay.

00:10:22.912 --> 00:10:23.867
- [Paige] This actually
doesn't happen much.

00:10:23.867 --> 00:10:25.260
It kind of has limited use,

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.092
but it's similar to how we use it

00:10:28.092 --> 00:10:29.746
for contractions in English.

00:10:29.746 --> 00:10:30.601
- [David] Sure.

00:10:30.601 --> 00:10:33.515
- [Paige] And like, how
this possessive was formed.

00:10:33.515 --> 00:10:34.885
It's interesting that the possessive,

00:10:34.885 --> 00:10:36.543
the modern possessive in English,

00:10:36.543 --> 00:10:38.616
is just a form of contraction.

00:10:38.616 --> 00:10:39.657
- [David] Yeah.

00:10:39.657 --> 00:10:40.841
- [Paige] It's bizarre.

00:10:40.841 --> 00:10:41.944
- [David] Well, folks, thank you so much

00:10:41.944 --> 00:10:43.093
for joining me on this journey

00:10:43.093 --> 00:10:45.997
through the wacky history of
the apostrophe, in English.

00:10:45.997 --> 00:10:47.238
- [Jake] Thanks for taking us.

00:10:47.238 --> 00:10:48.306
- [Paige] Yeah, it was fun.

00:10:48.306 --> 00:10:49.665
- [David] Anytime.

00:10:49.665 --> 00:10:52.869
And remember, folks, you can learn anything.

00:10:52.869 --> 00:10:54.094
David out.

00:10:54.094 --> 00:10:55.458
- [Paige] Paige out.

00:10:55.458 --> 00:10:56.470
- [Jake] Jake out.
