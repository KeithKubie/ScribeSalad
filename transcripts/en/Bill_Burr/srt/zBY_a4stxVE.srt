1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,620
Hey,
what's going on it's Bill Burr.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:07,920
It's time for the Monday morning
podcasts for Monday, June 26,

3
00:00:07,921 --> 00:00:11,490
2017 what's going on?
How

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,033
Hi are you doing?

5
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:21,870
How are you doing this fucken
Monday morning is global warming,

6
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:28,150
making you rough is hot.
Um,

7
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:33,220
climate change.
Let's give it a nicer name.

8
00:00:33,221 --> 00:00:34,600
So

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,780
what are we going to use was a
euphemism, Huh? Photosynthesis.

10
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:44,980
Jesus Christ. The, the
photosynthesis fucking police.

11
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:50,020
There's nothing people enjoy more on
the internet other than jerking off to

12
00:00:50,021 --> 00:00:54,360
people sold into the sex industry.
Sex, what do they call it?

13
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:57,310
A human trafficking is fucking,
um,

14
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,940
correcting somebody.
Jesus fucking Christ,

15
00:01:00,941 --> 00:01:04,000
the amount of gold they give
you have God for fucking bed.

16
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,320
A pasty fucking dope like me
makes a mistake every once,

17
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:12,870
every fucking five minutes on a podcast.

18
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,260
All of you fucking cunts cannot wait to
go on the Internet and just read me the

19
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:24,080
riot act like, like you're up for
some sort of fucking award in, in, in,

20
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,080
in the science industry, you know,
whatever the fuck they call it,

21
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:34,080
the science circuit.
So they always call a radio,

22
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,840
guys say that. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
We are working the circuit.

23
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,410
You mean doing the road? I didn't
realize there was a circuit. Um,

24
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,230
everybody fucking comment at
me. Photosynthesis. You are.

25
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,020
I think you met pollination.
Laughing my ass off.

26
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,270
You know Jesus fucking Christ.
Let me leave and let me
look it up right now. Paul,

27
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,120
the Nation de Duh de Duh Duh Paula nation.

28
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,890
Why is it ever been a ball player named
that pollination is the process by which

29
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:08,760
pollen is transferred to the female
reproductive organs of a plant,

30
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,860
thereby enabling fertilization to
take place. Like all living organisms,

31
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,510
seed plants ever singer may single major
goal to pass their genetic information

32
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,710
onto. All right, well how the fuck does
it get there? Well, it's pollination.

33
00:02:22,711 --> 00:02:24,570
O I s I said photosynthesis.
All right,

34
00:02:24,571 --> 00:02:26,730
so that's what I thought
photosynthesis was. Okay, here we go.

35
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,820
Photo synthesis.

36
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,640
That doesn't have a good
[inaudible] Paula nation

37
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,573
photo.

38
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,790
Oh

39
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:42,820
synthesis. I'd say you'd have to
bring them up now. Batting number 22

40
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:46,710
oh,

41
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:54,490
that's more like the MMA
fighting out of the red corner.

42
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:55,963
Hmm.

43
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,580
They can see, I guess what he
would just read the definition

44
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,820
fighting out of the red corner.

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,910
The process by which green plants and
some other organisms you sound like

46
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,570
designs that food.
They're writing,

47
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,170
um,
from carbon dioxide to war and water.

48
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,350
The process by which green
plants and some other organisms,

49
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,820
you sunlight to synthesize
foods from carbon dioxide,

50
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:21,420
carbon dioxide and water.
What does synthesize me?

51
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,420
See,
this is what happens.

52
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,650
Are they using a autotune synthesize,

53
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,560
s y,
s y.

54
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:37,470
S a sort of synthesize. You know
what I meant? All right. Sin.

55
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,100
Sin, the SIS synthesize. All right.

56
00:03:41,101 --> 00:03:45,960
The combination of ideas to
form a theory or system. Well,

57
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,560
that doesn't sound like the definition.
They were looking for. Synthesis.

58
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:54,410
Synthesis. Oh, come on. You fucking cunt.

59
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:55,431
Plural.

60
00:03:55,431 --> 00:03:59,270
Synthesis the formation of a chemical
compound through the combination of a

61
00:03:59,271 --> 00:04:00,770
simple compound of elements.

62
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,110
See Multi you guys that knew
that I used the wrong word.

63
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,380
You couldn't fucking tell
me what all these shipment.

64
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,590
You don't unless you own a lab coat,
right?

65
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,810
Photo synthesis, the process by which
green plants and some of the organism use.

66
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,840
Use Sunlight to synthesize foods
from carbon dioxide and water.

67
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:25,820
Like digest them. Turn them into something
edible says some con right now, like,

68
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:26,883
yeah,

69
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:33,010
shut up. All right, there you
fucking beaker reading cunt.

70
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,070
Fuck you. When you're black
framed glasses. All right.

71
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:40,840
Least I own my work.
Unlike you in the science industry,

72
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,480
who owns your shit and
what do they use it for?

73
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,960
You're out there trying to feed
plants using sunlight, right?

74
00:04:46,961 --> 00:04:49,960
And all of a sudden they come up
with a new way to send our magic.

75
00:04:49,961 --> 00:04:53,440
Mike says what? I'm starting to
call our missiles, Magic Mike's.

76
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:58,030
That's what we have in this country. We
got the top of the line fucking missiles.

77
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,450
You know,
like the,

78
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,940
the Mercedes in the Ferrari's
in f one top of the line.

79
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:08,080
We got the magic mix. We shoot them
into city a only kill the bad people,

80
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,960
right? Then all these terrorists groups,
they like to fucking, uh, the, uh,

81
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,490
who's the guys in the
orange cars this year,

82
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:20,500
that fucking cars blow up every Goddamn
fucking race. One of the Goddamn drivers,

83
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,570
cause you know what? Fuck you
guys, I'm taking a race off.

84
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:27,460
I'm going to go drive the Indy 500 he
left Formula One to drive a fucking Indy

85
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:30,580
five either an Indy car race in America.

86
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,110
The Mclaren Honda is still like the
terrorist group. You know what I mean?

87
00:05:35,111 --> 00:05:38,290
You don't know what the fuck's going
to happen, but we got the magic mix.

88
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,900
Magic bikes, photo synthesis, um,

89
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,600
Paula nation,
whatever you guys got me.

90
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,040
I'm the fucking, what's that
guy? Yachty, the guy, Jada,

91
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,440
you said blow me like a cello or whatever.

92
00:05:53,441 --> 00:05:56,860
I don't think I've ever related to a
rapper more in that moment, you know,

93
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,990
is wide as I am. That's
what it took. You know,

94
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,540
not talking about this
and talking about that.

95
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:06,590
It's the fact that that poor bastard
thought a cello was a wind instrument.

96
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,311
I was like,
you know what?

97
00:06:07,311 --> 00:06:10,940
This sounds like the kind of person that
I went to summer school with and you

98
00:06:10,941 --> 00:06:13,160
know what?
I bet he has other talents.

99
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:14,410
Yeah.

100
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:17,440
Other than being able to memorize all you
fucking cons out there where they were

101
00:06:17,441 --> 00:06:21,040
able to memorize what photosynthesis
was versus pollination.

102
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,720
Can I ask you a question? Seriously. In
all seriousness, where did it get you?

103
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:30,580
Huh? Other than getting to be
some content at cocktail party,

104
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:34,930
you know, what are you his social life,
you can talk photosynthesis and fashion.

105
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:40,120
Um, you know, by the way,
thank you for correcting me.

106
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,520
I don't know how it's
going to affect my life,

107
00:06:42,521 --> 00:06:47,320
but there was just something about the
joy that people took in and correcting me

108
00:06:47,321 --> 00:06:51,010
that uh, I took umbrage with
that. I use that correctly.

109
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,700
Or is that the wrong you word?
You know what?

110
00:06:54,701 --> 00:06:56,960
You know what I like about Twitter
is I don't even have to read anymore.

111
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:00,340
I'll just say shit that I think is right
and you guys can correct me, right?

112
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,890
I'll learn things.
You guys can feel better about yourselves.

113
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:08,560
You know that they could say, yeah, it's
a little fucking, what do they call those?

114
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:12,750
Surf and turf. Little scratch my
back. I scratch your back. I Dunno.

115
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,190
What do you see?
Beyonce sister.

116
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,730
She's got a Gig at the fucking
Hollywood ball. That's pretty what?

117
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:22,370
A fucking talented family.
You know what I mean?

118
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,890
That's how talented that family is.

119
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:28,760
Like she can't even get anybody to look
at her at the Thanksgiving table because

120
00:07:28,761 --> 00:07:32,380
they're fucking oldest sister sold out
the rose bowl. You know what I mean?

121
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,070
She's like the fuck up of the family cause
she only sold out the Hollywood bowl.

122
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:46,010
Honey, honey, honey,
quiet down. Quiet down.

123
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:52,100
Your sister is talking about what it was
like to be singing bootylicious as the

124
00:07:52,101 --> 00:07:55,960
stealth bomber flew over the stage.
Okay.

125
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:04,250
Um, was that wrong to do that?
Speaking of uh, pollination,

126
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:06,230
will this get the beehive after me?

127
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,880
You know what's funny about
all of those fucking groups?

128
00:08:09,881 --> 00:08:13,180
This so up the ass of the artist.
I swear to God she would fucking,

129
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:17,830
she wouldn't take her God damn shoes
off to run across the street and make a

130
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:20,860
fucking emergency call and one of
those old telephones back in the day,

131
00:08:20,861 --> 00:08:22,330
let's just say there wasn't cell phones.

132
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,970
If she saw one of you guys
sitting on the side of the road,

133
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:28,030
she wouldn't give a shit about you.
What's another one?

134
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,740
Who's another one's got a big
following, you know, that was it.

135
00:08:32,741 --> 00:08:34,390
It's the beehive

136
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,450
as a Mariah Carey have one.
You know what I mean?

137
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,580
I don't know what it is.
It's just, I don't know what,

138
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:48,540
there's something about acting like a
complete asshole and treating people like

139
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,520
shit that just women can't get an up
a certain type of woman. They can,

140
00:08:51,521 --> 00:08:56,320
they can't get enough of it.
What it, why, you know something

141
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:57,750
I always wanted if,

142
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:01,960
if more women were like Rhonda Rousey of
the current champion that I don't know

143
00:09:01,961 --> 00:09:04,520
the name of. My apologies. Um,

144
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,900
if more of them took like MMA could
actually beat the fuck out of you,

145
00:09:07,901 --> 00:09:12,850
would they just not walk around being
mean to each other as much? You know, guy,

146
00:09:12,851 --> 00:09:15,740
I think that's the only reason why guys
aren't as mean as women are because

147
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,200
personally speaking anyways,

148
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,100
cause I know that 90% of guys can
beat the shit out of me. Right.

149
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,140
At the very least land.
A couple to my, you know,

150
00:09:23,141 --> 00:09:27,970
and I fucking bruise like the Irishman.
I am, you know, stop the fight, you know,

151
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,680
two punches in. I don't need
that shit. So I try to basically,

152
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,810
you know, mind my ps and qs.
What does that stand for?

153
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:42,280
How you fucking brainiacs?
Um, what does that stand for?

154
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,240
Let me find out. Like, you know,

155
00:09:43,241 --> 00:09:47,410
and I have to fact check everything so
I don't get fucking and get people up my

156
00:09:47,411 --> 00:09:48,970
ass again.
Mine.

157
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:50,830
Hm.

158
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:55,830
Your p's and q's minding
your ps and Qs p and Q.

159
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:06,100
Origin or is it yeah, it's ps and Qs,
not p and Q. Mind your p's and q's.

160
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,780
You fucking cunt. How do you not to
say that without you fucking cunt.

161
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,283
Okay.

162
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,420
What does mind your p's and q's come from?

163
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:16,890
This is going to be a very
special educational podcast.
It's just going to be me.

164
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,510
All right.
Okay.

165
00:10:20,511 --> 00:10:23,030
If you've ever been told
him mind your p's and q's,

166
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,520
it might have struck you as
a rather odd thing to do.

167
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:31,090
That's a nice way of saying
it was annoying. I think
anytime somebody say, hey,

168
00:10:31,091 --> 00:10:34,510
mind your p's and q's, I, my immediate
thought was, who the fuck is this guy

169
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,850
telling me to mind these things?
Uh,

170
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:43,790
I almost said some eighties comedy
telling me to mind these things. Uh,

171
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,070
the concepts seems reasonable
enough. Behaving, behaving. Well,

172
00:10:48,071 --> 00:10:49,010
not giving offense,

173
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:54,030
but quite but co quite what the letters
p and Q have to do with this as a little

174
00:10:55,151 --> 00:10:59,360
more mysterious. Why not be in
d o Jesus? Here's something.

175
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,120
Why not be a day?

176
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:10,170
Can you just fucking get a
whole entry? All right. Yeah,

177
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:11,890
there's a whole fucking,
this guy's just, you know,

178
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:14,340
some funny about these fucking
assholes who write for a living.

179
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,290
They just can't get to it.

180
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:21,130
They feel if they don't take up
a whole fucking page or bill,

181
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,660
maybe there's people out there that enjoy
reading. Maybe it's sad. Okay, I'll, I'll,

182
00:11:24,661 --> 00:11:25,860
you know,
I'll take the ride.

183
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:31,260
Why not be in d or m and m m
n n or any other combination?

184
00:11:31,261 --> 00:11:31,831
Sadly,

185
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:36,450
as it often is the case with the more
intriguing terms in the English language,

186
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,900
there is no definitive answer
to the other one. What the fuck.

187
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,500
No one knows what it means.

188
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:48,260
This last meeting were like to to that,
that Dah the

189
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,650
mean queen and not queen.

190
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:58,820
What the best possible manners.
Mind your dancing.

191
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,480
Yeah, I dunno. The Oxford dictionary
doesn't even know the answer.

192
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,380
You know it's funny. They don't even
have the fucking answer yet. They still,

193
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,930
they still couldn't. They couldn't
keep their mouth shut. Could they?

194
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,720
I bet somebody else has.
Once somebody at this point see Internet,

195
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:20,160
somebody's going to take a guess.
All right. What does it mean?

196
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,490
Yeah.

197
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:25,090
Ever been told to mind your P's and cute
every yes. Yes. That's why I'm here.

198
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,960
Unless you're working on mechanical
printing press at the time,

199
00:12:29,961 --> 00:12:34,220
chances are you are fairly subtly
being told to mind your manners,

200
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:39,720
but what exactly are your p's and q's?
The short answer is knowing really know

201
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:46,580
why isn't that why? Why is it that
right there mind your p's and q's.

202
00:12:46,581 --> 00:12:48,500
What does it mean and then boom.
Nobody knows.

203
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,130
Yeah.

204
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:50,170
What?

205
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:53,380
What kind of a fucking [inaudible] you
ever been told to mind your p's and q's?

206
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:58,030
Well, you weren't, you know, writing
press, fucking two paragraphs. This,

207
00:12:58,031 --> 00:12:58,864
you know what to do is,

208
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:03,610
cause this is delving into the world
of people that like to know shit.

209
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,830
So even when they don't know shit,

210
00:13:05,831 --> 00:13:09,940
they still have to fucking write
three paragraphs on it. Alright,

211
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:13,600
fuck all of this. Fuck all that.
They've always just frustrating.

212
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,690
Um, anyways, and I am actually being out.

213
00:13:17,691 --> 00:13:20,830
Before I looked up those things before
I remember that you guys corrected me.

214
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,640
You know, maybe you guys
weren't being assholes. Maybe
just trying to help me out.

215
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,370
You know, snakes, I'm
hanging around a socialite,

216
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,123
you know,

217
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:35,050
socially, as far as I can tell, it's
just a well red gold digging whore,

218
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:38,170
you know,
like how did you get there?

219
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:40,560
You've got to be married to
somebody rich if you just want,

220
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,300
if you just pleasant to be around, you
don't really have a fucking job. I mean,

221
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,280
somebody's going to be bring,
bringing home the Bacon, right?

222
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:47,403
Yeah.

223
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,320
Bringing home the Bacon.
Where did that come from? You
know, I mean, unless you're,

224
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:55,340
unless you're a farmer, I don't
know a less you, you're working a,

225
00:13:55,341 --> 00:13:56,420
unless you're a board chair.

226
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,440
I was 20 fucking paragraphs later
point is nobody really knows.

227
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:07,190
Um, anyways, I'm actually,

228
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,570
uh,
relieved,

229
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:13,600
believe it or not because I
did the big Papi roast on,

230
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:14,901
uh,
what was it?

231
00:14:14,901 --> 00:14:19,901
Thursday night and thank Christ it went
about as great as it could have gone.

232
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,560
I am not a big fan of doing rose. You
know what the last roast I did was I did

233
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,790
the Patrice O'Neal roast like
15 years ago or something.

234
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,650
Whenever the hell that was,
that was the last time,

235
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,590
cause I never understood doing one
unless you were friends with the person.

236
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:37,230
Right. But I always like is, I
always see guys like Lenny class

237
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:43,820
it dead. And uh, Dennis Leary, uh,

238
00:14:43,821 --> 00:14:45,800
you know, they're always
hanging out at red sox games,

239
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,720
getting up in the broadcast booth.
And I'm like,

240
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:51,840
I would love to fucking do some shit
like that. I need to do more Boston shit.

241
00:14:51,841 --> 00:14:55,040
So this thing came up and I'm like,
ah, why did it have to be a roast?

242
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:00,170
And Nia chimed in. She's like, Oh
shit. So I said, yes, I'll do it.

243
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:06,530
Then I had no time to fucking right cause
that was dealing with a bunch of other

244
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:11,000
shit and uh,
all of a sudden it was a few days away.

245
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,290
And um, I dealt with that race, that race,

246
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:20,570
that roast the way this
country dealt with a y two k,

247
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:26,120
you know what? We waited until the last
second. Then we were like, oh my God,

248
00:15:26,121 --> 00:15:29,090
what are we going to do? Like we treated
it like a fucking giant term paper.

249
00:15:29,091 --> 00:15:30,710
That's what I did.
Um,

250
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:35,780
and it was a race to Thursday when I
was trying to say a race to the finish

251
00:15:35,781 --> 00:15:39,950
line, a race against time. Um,

252
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:45,480
and I actually figured out how my brain
works when it comes to those fucking

253
00:15:45,481 --> 00:15:48,290
things.
It's the same way it works for Standup,

254
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,690
but for some reason you think like a
roast. I have to sit down and write jokes.

255
00:15:51,691 --> 00:15:56,540
That's not what I needed to do. I needed
to, to put my daughter is at my joy.

256
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:01,200
I had to put my daughter in the
stroller and walk around the block.

257
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:04,470
And then I had to,
uh,

258
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:09,500
I smoked a cigar by myself on the back
porch and I just kept thinking that shit

259
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,990
and I would just videotape
myself saying it.

260
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,820
And then I had all these videos and
I forget if I told you this guys,

261
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,420
you guys is on a, Oh sorry, on Thursday,

262
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,990
but I just watched the videos and I
just spliced together every good one,

263
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,720
just transcribed them.
And then I had the block of everybody,

264
00:16:30,721 --> 00:16:35,100
right. I had poppy, grump
Pedroia, Josh Wolfe,

265
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,680
Lenny Clack,
Sarah Tiana,

266
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:43,310
Anthony Mackie and everybody that was on
the fucking thing and I just would put

267
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:45,743
them underneath

268
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:51,890
each name and then I just made a new
document and I just took the best of the

269
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:57,480
best, slit them over. Then I put
them in the best possible order.

270
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,070
Then I went in order of person
and then I smoothed it out.

271
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:03,830
And um,

272
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,533
yeah,

273
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,920
and it all worked.
Thank fucking Christ.

274
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,400
The only way to make fun of David Ortiz
was to just to make fun of how he looked.

275
00:17:12,401 --> 00:17:14,770
In the fact that he was a DH.
That's all I had.

276
00:17:14,771 --> 00:17:18,730
And I made fun of the Dominican
Republic a little bit. Um,

277
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:24,300
and that was it. That was it.
So I don't know if this video,

278
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:28,650
I know Gronk fucking killed
Pedroia killed.

279
00:17:28,651 --> 00:17:31,080
He told his fucking hilarious
story about popping,

280
00:17:31,081 --> 00:17:35,160
not knowing his first name was Dustin.
Somebody said to him like,

281
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:39,180
poppy was in the batter's box,
not the batter's box.

282
00:17:39,181 --> 00:17:41,370
He was on like the on deck circle.

283
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:46,320
And podria was stepped out of the batter's
box on called time out of something.

284
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:49,050
And the catcher just said hello
to Dee, said, hey, what's up?

285
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,450
And when Dustin walked over to poppy
to talk to him, poppy said, he goes,

286
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:57,390
what the fuck did that guy just say to
you to fuck? Did that guy just call you?

287
00:17:57,391 --> 00:18:01,650
He's, he said, he said, what's
up Dustin? And poppy was like,

288
00:18:01,651 --> 00:18:06,400
what the fuck does that mean? It goes,
ah, that's my first, it's my first name.

289
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,650
Poppy was like re Oh yeah,
like he didn't even know

290
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:17,940
that his name was [inaudible].
So for is like,

291
00:18:17,941 --> 00:18:21,960
dude, it's my first name. But they
introduced me every time I go up to bed,

292
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:25,710
I've been going up to bat like
10,000 times. I bet in front of you.

293
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:29,520
Every time I come to the plate they say,
now batting number 15,

294
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,960
Dustin Pedroia. And it just,
it never clicked with them.

295
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,800
There's another guy I would've gone to
summer school with Petrolia. Got It.

296
00:18:37,801 --> 00:18:40,620
Like I think podria got it the worst.
He was hilarious.

297
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:45,120
He just kept sitting there like, dude,
what the fuck ever. You know, it was just,

298
00:18:45,121 --> 00:18:47,210
I think he got, you
know, speaking of 11,000,

299
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:50,400
it was like 11,000 short jokes for him.
So there,

300
00:18:50,401 --> 00:18:54,090
there is clips of it up on the
Internet. Um, it wasn't the greatest

301
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,380
organize thing was the first time they
did it and they didn't know how to do a

302
00:18:58,381 --> 00:18:58,680
roast.

303
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:03,680
And you can't have people filming at
it because a roast is so over the top.

304
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:06,480
And that's how people get in
trouble and they, you know,

305
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,420
they take shit out of context
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

306
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,610
It's completely fucking
over the top. So, uh,

307
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:18,300
you know, I don't know why. I don't
know why they let they let people film.

308
00:19:18,301 --> 00:19:21,120
I don't know why things happened. Why
did things happen like that? But anyways,

309
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:26,690
I had to go on dead last and everybody
fucking killed Lenny went up first killed

310
00:19:27,511 --> 00:19:28,201
Adam Ray,

311
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:32,850
went up dressed as a Yankee fan named
Tony and just told everybody in the crowd

312
00:19:32,851 --> 00:19:37,140
to suck his dick and kept trashing yeah.
Big Papi.

313
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:40,770
And then bragging about the Yankees.
27 championships in the crowd.

314
00:19:40,771 --> 00:19:43,250
Loved it while they were born.
And they also love, and it,

315
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,710
he was fucking hilarious.
Um,

316
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:51,120
Anthony Mackie killed Sarah Tiana fucking
destroyed probably at my favorite joke

317
00:19:51,121 --> 00:19:54,300
in the night. And then, uh,

318
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:57,480
fuck eh Gronk went up,
killed,

319
00:19:57,481 --> 00:20:02,400
then put Roya and then I
had to go up last and a,

320
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:05,550
it's one of those things as you sit there,
you know,

321
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,720
you're kind of losing angles as you go.
So I tried to do,

322
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,740
I tried to just go like a unique way.

323
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,520
So with Gronk I knew everybody was going
to say it was stupid. So I was like,

324
00:20:17,521 --> 00:20:20,630
all right, I'm going to say smart.
I'm going to go that way with it,

325
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,990
by the way, by the way. Um,

326
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:29,820
he actually was commenting on how he
hates going to concerts and everybody sits

327
00:20:29,821 --> 00:20:33,240
there fucking looking at the concert
through their phone. You know what I mean?

328
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,380
How's fucking stupid that is, I love
everybody thinks that that guy's dumb.

329
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:42,390
You know, like you can make it to the NFL,
memorize the playbook and all of that,

330
00:20:42,391 --> 00:20:46,590
all that fucking shit you gotta learn
and then go out on the field against the

331
00:20:46,591 --> 00:20:51,400
top athletes on the planet and make split
second decisions and reactions to how

332
00:20:51,401 --> 00:20:55,660
they're reacting to you and people feel
that you can actually get there and just

333
00:20:55,661 --> 00:20:57,460
be this big dumb guy.

334
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,290
I knew he wasn't going to be done when I
met him and he wasn't. So that was a, uh,

335
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:05,530
that made the shit that I was going
to say about them even better. I mean,

336
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:08,950
I did one dumb joke, a bond of being
done, but I had to get through it.

337
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:12,910
I had to do like fucking 10, 12 minutes.
So anyways, it, uh, it went great.

338
00:21:12,911 --> 00:21:17,470
And my favorite, yeah, part of
bought it was a poppy yelled,

339
00:21:17,471 --> 00:21:20,140
fuck you with me?
I've at least three or four times

340
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,010
and I just kept going, fuck you too man.
It's a roast. You wanted to get roasted.

341
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:31,340
Here we go. And uh, he was
such a fucking great guy.

342
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:36,410
The guy really is, is a rockstar man.
His whole vibe is a fucking rock stuff.

343
00:21:36,411 --> 00:21:37,340
So when I finished,

344
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,760
he got up off the chair and came over
and gave me a big fucking hug and uh,

345
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:44,830
and thank me for doing it just to,

346
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:48,410
just really like one of the great
fucking people I've ever gotten to do

347
00:21:48,411 --> 00:21:52,940
something like that for. So, uh, what
was funny is I had, I had just as much,

348
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,330
I think I had more jokes about Lindy
Clark than I did about poppy just cause I

349
00:21:56,331 --> 00:21:59,570
knew him, which is why I always feel
like if you're going to do a roast,

350
00:21:59,571 --> 00:22:02,390
you should know the person.
And um,

351
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:08,240
what's hilarious is Lenny has been
clean and sober for like a quarter of a

352
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,040
century.
And a,

353
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:13,520
all of my jokes were about him
just being a fucking, you know,

354
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:18,350
complete mania. I, I talked to him
basically like he wasn't sober,

355
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:20,860
like he had been sober and he was,
you know,

356
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:26,270
the best guy about a great sport about
itself. Anyways, long story short,

357
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,760
um, I got through it and I told you
once I got through that Gig, my,

358
00:22:31,761 --> 00:22:36,500
the whole rest of my year
fucking nothing easy, easy, easy,

359
00:22:36,501 --> 00:22:41,440
easy peasy. Everything's in my wheelhouse.
It's the weirdest fucking year from me.

360
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:46,040
I had all the crazy shit
I had to do this. Um, oh,

361
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,990
this year was all in this month.
All of this stuff of just, um,

362
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,240
I haven't thought,

363
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:58,940
I haven't set worried thinking how the
fuck is this going to go this many times

364
00:22:58,941 --> 00:23:01,910
in one month since back when I
first started out doing standup,

365
00:23:01,911 --> 00:23:06,530
which basically every show I was
going up thinking like, ah, fuck,

366
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:10,280
commit to your shit. Get that
first laugh, ride the wave,

367
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:15,770
don't go over, say good night. Get
the fuck out of there, you know?

368
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:19,530
So, um, that's it. And I'm ready to
go to the summer. The next night.

369
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:24,150
We all went to the game,
got to see the retirement ceremony and uh,

370
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:27,960
it was great. Man. Jim Rice
was there. Carl Yastrzemski,

371
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:34,620
Veritech, Pedro Martinez, um,

372
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:41,320
Pedroia came out and uh, I got to see the
whole thing, man, they took the, you know,

373
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:45,030
one covered it,
got to see when they were first put 34 up.

374
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,650
And um,

375
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,770
I got to admit though, part of it was sad.
It was like, fuck, it's over. It's over.

376
00:23:52,771 --> 00:23:56,370
Now he's part of the history
of the Boston red sox.

377
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,950
And UHM,
I dunno.

378
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,730
No, I, I, you know, all
those ceremonies, man,

379
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:05,550
they was just remind you that
you're gonna fucking die. Like, oh,

380
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:09,340
now he's too old to play baseball.
He's too old to fucking play.

381
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:13,930
And I'm like 15 years fucking older
than he is at 10 years older than him,

382
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:15,723
you know.

383
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:16,400
Okay.

384
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,130
So you can call your strep ski
coming out with all white hair.

385
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:21,700
Yeah.

386
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,000
I should've known that was coming. That
guy played until he was like fucking 40.

387
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:29,230
Oh my God, I'm on nine years
older than when that guy retired.

388
00:24:29,231 --> 00:24:32,800
Maybe play the like 43. I don't fucking
know. This is getting depressing.

389
00:24:32,801 --> 00:24:37,000
How do I get out of this? How the
fuck do I get out of this? Oh, I know.

390
00:24:37,001 --> 00:24:41,830
Let's talk f one and fucking
Moto GP. Pete, Pete, Pete. Um,

391
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:43,570
all right.

392
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:48,570
So race number fucking eight or nine
of the f one a season in Azerbaijan.

393
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,710
Is that [inaudible] as her by
Jan [inaudible], Jan, whatever.

394
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:00,520
Just east of Georgia
and I don't mean fucking

395
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,140
Georgia United States, the country,
Georgia and I guess it's in Asia.

396
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,450
It's not eastern Europe. I was
getting, it's always weird,

397
00:25:07,451 --> 00:25:10,710
Georgia and all the way over there. You
don't know where the fuck they're at. Uh,

398
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,100
one of the coolest cities.

399
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,333
MMM.

400
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:18,190
On the f one circuit using that word
circuit. Uh, just a beautiful city.

401
00:25:18,191 --> 00:25:20,260
I would love to go there,
but I definitely looked up like,

402
00:25:20,261 --> 00:25:25,060
is that like a one of those
places I shouldn't go? Should
I have like a Canadian,

403
00:25:25,061 --> 00:25:27,430
a fucking flag on my backpack?

404
00:25:27,431 --> 00:25:32,431
Should I speak in an Irish
brogue when I go there?

405
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:37,210
I'm seeing like it was pretty safe.
I don't know. I don't fucking know.

406
00:25:37,211 --> 00:25:40,570
I had a great time.
What crazy God damn fucking race.

407
00:25:40,571 --> 00:25:42,910
Congratulations to Daniel Ricardo,

408
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:47,920
who I take might be the best driver in
f one considering he doesn't have the

409
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:50,260
best engine and he's always
on the fucking podium.

410
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:53,650
Any drinks champagne out of
his fucking shoe. So you know,

411
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,510
God bless you. And I dunno about
this Lewis Hamilton guy. I was a fan.

412
00:25:58,511 --> 00:26:00,910
I think he's a fucking great driver,
but I don't know.

413
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:05,170
They said he didn't hit the brakes
flow did you guys don't watch it?

414
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:08,550
They want to caution the fucking
safety car was out there. You know,

415
00:26:08,551 --> 00:26:12,330
guys always complained that the safety
car drives too fucking slow, you know,

416
00:26:12,331 --> 00:26:13,650
which cools off to tires.

417
00:26:13,651 --> 00:26:16,950
Then they don't have any grip and then
they slam into the fucking wall or into

418
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:19,920
each other. Right. So anyways,

419
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:23,910
Hamilton was complaining that the fucking
guy was driving too slow and then for

420
00:26:23,911 --> 00:26:26,100
whatever reason he hits
the brakes really hard.

421
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,490
And Sebastian Vettel rear ended him and
he was like, what the fuck? And then he,

422
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,620
fennel pulls up alongside of them,
slammed his cars and like, you know,

423
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,700
tire to tire and a,
he got a ten second penalty for that.

424
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,770
And um,

425
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:46,110
I dunno, I kind of view it and they said
to Hamilton, didn't slam on the brakes,

426
00:26:46,111 --> 00:26:49,800
but I kind of viewed this as one of
the, the ball don't lie. You know,

427
00:26:49,801 --> 00:26:53,010
they say that in basketball when there's
some piece of shit file bullshit,

428
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,160
file guide flops, you go up there
and you miss the foul shots.

429
00:26:56,161 --> 00:26:57,360
They would say the ball don't lie.

430
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:01,680
Well only a after that thing they
said Hamilton Slam on the brakes.

431
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:04,470
Hamilton and slam on the brakes and
federal was guilty as slamming into him.

432
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:06,750
And the only game at ten second penalty,

433
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:09,980
I guess they said they should have
been more, uh, so be basically,

434
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:13,500
he has to drive into the fucking pits
and sit there for 10 seconds as everybody

435
00:27:13,501 --> 00:27:17,790
keeps going and then drives back
out again. But Hamilton, after that,

436
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,990
uh, that fucking thing that goes around
his neck or whatever outside the car,

437
00:27:21,991 --> 00:27:25,350
that thing came loose.
So he had the fucking Poland anyways,

438
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,630
which fucked him over and
Vettel still beat him.

439
00:27:27,631 --> 00:27:31,200
So I looked at that like the ball
don't lie and Hamilton, fuck.

440
00:27:31,201 --> 00:27:34,500
I didn't like how he fucking said
Deeks says to his team saying,

441
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:39,900
poultice should slow down. He should
slow down to help me pack federal.

442
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,340
Go Fuck Yourself.

443
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:46,820
What about last year when the team calls
you up to slow down for fucking Nico

444
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:51,610
Rosberg and you're like, Nah, I'm good.
You are out there driving fee itself.

445
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:54,900
You know what that guy reminds me of?
He reminds me of a couple of comedians.

446
00:27:54,901 --> 00:27:58,230
I'm not going to fucking mentioned their
names when I was on that one my way up

447
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,360
with them and they were
these fucking people.

448
00:28:00,361 --> 00:28:01,800
They were happy if you've got something,

449
00:28:01,801 --> 00:28:05,490
as long as they had more and they would
literally stab your mother in the eye if

450
00:28:05,491 --> 00:28:10,000
they could get an inch forward. That's
what I got out of that fucking shit. Hey,

451
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:13,630
she'd slow down and go,
fuck you got fucking Mercedes Benz engine.

452
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,630
That isn't enough for you.
I still like Lewis Hamilton,

453
00:28:16,631 --> 00:28:19,990
but that was kind of girly. That
was kind of girly. I thought,

454
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:23,040
you know what I mean? I might
be out of my fucking mind. Yeah.

455
00:28:23,041 --> 00:28:27,730
I don't like that shit is what I don't
like about f one is basically the fucking

456
00:28:27,731 --> 00:28:31,480
Mercedes and the Ferrari's.
Okay.

457
00:28:31,481 --> 00:28:34,300
If you don't root for either one of
those other teams, every other team,

458
00:28:34,301 --> 00:28:38,350
it's like they're out there driving
around in a fucking z 28. Okay.

459
00:28:38,351 --> 00:28:42,280
And Ferrari and Mercedes, they're
driving around in a corvette. Coo Six.

460
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:48,000
Seeing that lance stroll,
he was like 10 seconds ahead of uh,

461
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:53,490
uh, both tests. What happened to him
at the early part of the race? Oh,

462
00:28:53,491 --> 00:28:55,770
they already buy the rights. Everybody
fucking hit each other in the beginning.

463
00:28:55,771 --> 00:28:59,280
So he had to go and he was immediately
a lap down. He's a lap down.

464
00:28:59,281 --> 00:29:00,870
He does his stroke erase shit.

465
00:29:00,871 --> 00:29:05,370
Like a fucking movie just flies
through the entire fucking field.

466
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:09,610
I mean Daniel Ricardo did the same thing,
but he sees in the red bull thing,

467
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:12,490
they got to get inferior engine. Like
they won't give him one of those Mercedes,

468
00:29:12,491 --> 00:29:15,970
they won't sell the guy a Mercedes or
a Ferrari engine. Cause he knows he,

469
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,740
he be too much of a problem.

470
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,800
That's why I think he's the best driver
out there cause he's driving around and

471
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:25,600
basically a fucking z 28 and he's
always up on the podium. So anyways,

472
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:31,590
um, for Cindy and my fucking team there,
I don't know what's going on with them.

473
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,860
They got this whole Ricky,
Bobby, Ricky bubby shit going on,

474
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,340
slamming into each other.
What the fuck is wrong with them?

475
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,820
Esteban Khan and Sergio Perez,

476
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,920
they basically took each
other out of the race.

477
00:29:44,921 --> 00:29:46,750
They would have been on the podium one,

478
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:50,170
possibly two cars and for
half a fucking second.

479
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:55,000
What is it t the Haas team.
The fucking American team.

480
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:59,470
Magnuson was like in third place.
All right.

481
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:02,500
Two of the Williams give us
the craziest fucking race.

482
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:07,120
Like the front of the race was Daniel
Ricardo like both Williams, Martini,

483
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:11,740
Martini racing, whatever the
fuck you said. And uh, Magnuson.

484
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:15,650
Then of course they all just get run down.
They all get fucking rundown.

485
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:21,160
Both was like 10 seconds behind stroll
with like 10 laps to go and he fucking

486
00:30:21,161 --> 00:30:25,150
caught him right at the finish
line to get second place.

487
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:28,540
Um,
so that's it.

488
00:30:28,541 --> 00:30:33,400
I can no longer route for fucking
Ferrari and I can't root for a Mercedes

489
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:36,080
because I feel like I'm root for the
Yankees or the Red Sox, you know,

490
00:30:36,081 --> 00:30:38,230
reason why I root for the red sox.
It's cause I'm from Boston.

491
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:42,040
What am I supposed to do? But like, you
know, they both blow to what? $1 million,

492
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:43,390
but not this year.
The Yankees have it.

493
00:30:43,391 --> 00:30:46,720
But I'm just saying generally speaking
throughout history, right. So I can't,

494
00:30:46,721 --> 00:30:48,450
I can't like pile on,

495
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:54,790
pull a Kevin Durant or Lebron down
in Miami or the big three in Boston,

496
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:59,740
two out of three anyways. Um, I can't
fucking do that. So my team, my teams,

497
00:30:59,741 --> 00:31:03,940
I like, I liked the forced Cindy
India team and I liked the, uh,

498
00:31:03,941 --> 00:31:06,460
the Williams racing team. That's
the coolest looking car, I think.

499
00:31:06,461 --> 00:31:09,640
I like their colors. You
know, red, white and blue.

500
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:13,870
I guess they used to dominate though.
I got to read up more on this sport.

501
00:31:13,871 --> 00:31:17,020
I don't get how you used to fucking
dominate then everybody, you just suck.

502
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,113
You know,

503
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,860
I don't get it.

504
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,820
It's not like other sports where you've
got athletes getting old and dying,

505
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:29,390
not dying, retiring, I should say. I mean,

506
00:31:29,391 --> 00:31:32,990
if you know how to make a fucking
engine work at that level,

507
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:37,320
shouldn't you just know how to do it?
I know,

508
00:31:37,321 --> 00:31:39,350
I know the driver does count
for something, but gee,

509
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,880
I don't fucking know what I'm saying.
I don't know shit about this stuff.

510
00:31:41,881 --> 00:31:45,420
I just know it's fun to watch.
I guess red bull won like three in a row,

511
00:31:45,421 --> 00:31:46,740
like I don't know, five, six years ago.

512
00:31:46,741 --> 00:31:50,550
And then all of a sudden what engine
where they use and then bold look it up,

513
00:31:50,551 --> 00:31:51,900
Bill.
I'm afraid to,

514
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:55,050
I'm afraid to look it up and it'll be
like fucking p's and q's and no one will

515
00:31:55,051 --> 00:31:59,700
have an answer. So I watched that
today. And then I also watched the, uh,

516
00:31:59,701 --> 00:32:04,560
the Moto GP race, which was
fucking insane. Both races.

517
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:09,360
What great. The Moto GP race was
even fucking better. Like is crazy.

518
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:13,740
Is that race was, did they have a problem
with that? Uh, as a by Jan race where,

519
00:32:13,741 --> 00:32:17,070
because it goes through a city that you
don't have those cranes to lift the cars

520
00:32:17,071 --> 00:32:21,030
out of the way and this fucking
debris all over the track. Um,

521
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:24,090
they actually had a red flag
and everybody just pulled in.

522
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,590
It just stopped is all these guys were
running around the track picking up shit

523
00:32:28,591 --> 00:32:32,520
from other cars that is smashed into
each other. As crazy as that race was,

524
00:32:32,521 --> 00:32:36,240
the motor GP race was,
was the Shit Valentino Rossi.

525
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,150
It's like 38 fucking years old.
He ended winning the thing. Um,

526
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,060
just imagine all the
bullshit that was happened.

527
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,860
F One with them bumping into each other.

528
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:50,690
They're doing it on motorcycles going
like 150, 200 fucking miles an hour.

529
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:56,220
Um, you know who the guy
I liked the best on the,

530
00:32:56,221 --> 00:33:00,290
I mean I always root for Valentino Rossi
just cause he's old and I relate and I

531
00:33:00,291 --> 00:33:02,690
want him to keep winning. So it
doesn't make me feel like, you know,

532
00:33:02,691 --> 00:33:06,260
when he retires that my God, there's
another guy. Um, I liked that.

533
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:11,420
Johann Johann Zarko, that guy's a fucking
lunatic. And I also liked the color,

534
00:33:11,421 --> 00:33:15,230
the bike, the black and the yellow,
whatever it got. Um, I liked him. I liked,

535
00:33:15,231 --> 00:33:18,860
and then I also like, uh, the Ducati team.

536
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,840
I liked that. How you
say his last name? Dov.

537
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:27,500
A coc. Seals. So I can't say it.

538
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:31,310
I can't say someone's got to say I got
to watch another 15 races to be able to

539
00:33:31,311 --> 00:33:35,000
pronounce that. Dov. I Z I o so

540
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:37,603
zoo.
So

541
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:44,540
Doe Dovi Dovizioso Dovizioso
Sat. I said German, Irish,

542
00:33:44,541 --> 00:33:47,490
like we usually have two syllable once.
Silva fucking last names. I can't, that's,

543
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:49,490
that's too many fucking hills.

544
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,510
Dovizioso Andrea Dovizioso.

545
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:00,770
Gatsy prego. Uh, just an
incredible fucking race.

546
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:05,840
Mac Marquez was in there too. Um,
and then that fucking lunatic, the,

547
00:34:05,841 --> 00:34:10,160
the British guy, cal crutch low. I
don't know where the fuck he came from.

548
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:13,010
That guy rides like a [inaudible]
the way he wrote it. Yo hands.

549
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:17,950
Zarko I liked them. They're out of
their fucking mind. Um, so I'm gonna,

550
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:21,170
I'm, I'm all in on both of those
races. It's so fucking easy to watch.

551
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,550
20 something lapse. And then the, uh, the
one today with the cars was like, what?

552
00:34:25,551 --> 00:34:29,180
Like 50 fucking labs? 51.
It's a good goddamn time.

553
00:34:29,181 --> 00:34:32,660
And then after that I take
my daughter out. You know,

554
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:37,100
a lot of people when they
want to get their babies to
fall asleep, a lot of dads,

555
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,590
what they do is they put him in
the car and they drive around.

556
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,900
It's hilarious because the
movement makes him go to sleep.

557
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:44,990
But then you get to a red light and they
wake up and they start crying again.

558
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:49,430
That's why I am a big proponent
of the stroller. All right.

559
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:52,010
Cause you can keep that fucking thing.
If he had a red light, you can keep it,

560
00:34:52,011 --> 00:34:52,850
you know,
if you're walking.

561
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:57,350
And also it's a great way to
prevent the dreaded dad bod.

562
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,620
Okay?
All you fucking guys out there,

563
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:04,700
you throw them in the car and
then you drive around, you know,

564
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,680
then they fall asleep
and then what do you do?

565
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:11,750
You hit the drive through
because you're tired. You know,

566
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,441
Arby's,

567
00:35:12,441 --> 00:35:15,680
we have the meats and then you get that
fucking sandwich that Osa has a pig on

568
00:35:15,681 --> 00:35:19,340
it. The pork, the spare ribs or whatever
the fuck they put on there. The ribs,

569
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:23,720
the hoof, the hough. Um,

570
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:25,551
yeah,

571
00:35:25,551 --> 00:35:30,551
I've been just walking
around my neighborhood and
she falls asleep and then,

572
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:35,270
uh, I just keep walking throughout her
whole nap and went to the fucking butcher,

573
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:39,210
went to the supermarket,
knock out some errands as she's asleep.

574
00:35:39,211 --> 00:35:41,010
You just keep it fucking
moving the whole time.

575
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:46,260
You throw the groceries on the
bottom of the stroller and that's it.

576
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,080
It's a little dad tip for you.
If you got, he got a better one.

577
00:35:49,081 --> 00:35:49,914
I don't know what to tell you.

578
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:52,260
I do the elliptical while she's
still sleeping in the morning,

579
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:56,130
and then I take her for a trip around
the neighborhood. You got to do it.

580
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:00,180
He can't, you can't do the car thing.
Then you've got to go out and walk,

581
00:36:00,181 --> 00:36:04,020
put on your track suits, right.
Track shoes, your dad's socks,

582
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:07,530
you fucking Jean shorts,
whatever the fuck you got going on.

583
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,170
You're a true religion.
Jeans.

584
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:17,980
I love that. I never gave it to
that fed. Those were the z cavalry.

585
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:22,380
She's a fucking last decade
giant stitching with the fucking,

586
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:27,410
you want to get lucky boy
fucking horse shoe on the back.

587
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:32,430
Uh, there was always something funny
about a horse shoe on the ass pockets that

588
00:36:32,431 --> 00:36:35,190
always to me was more
gay pride parade than a

589
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:40,020
Fuckin a little fucking chicks over
there. But they fuck, they loved them.

590
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:41,730
They loved them.

591
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:46,590
And speaking of fucking the
Gay Pride Parade, you know,

592
00:36:46,591 --> 00:36:50,550
it's slowly making a comeback and I love
it cause I never had a problem with it

593
00:36:50,551 --> 00:36:51,660
is rollerblading.

594
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:56,880
Rollerblading is slowly making a comeback.

595
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,990
I loved it. I used to go down the
beach with my short shorts on,

596
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,233
skating backwards,

597
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:08,790
getting little boy short true religion boy
shorts. I did it. We share. We all did.

598
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,910
Ah, there's the Photoshop for
the week, but you know what,

599
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:15,210
there's no fucking true religion. Boy
Shorts. It good luck with you on that one.

600
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:19,200
Fuck. Oh um, no. I liked that.

601
00:37:19,201 --> 00:37:23,400
I used to play fucking a in New York
and out in Santa Monica down in Venice

602
00:37:23,401 --> 00:37:27,660
beach.
I used to play roller hockey and uh,

603
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:32,670
Jesus Christ catching an edge never hurt
more than when you were in a fucking

604
00:37:32,671 --> 00:37:36,480
parking lot. Ugh. You
had to go elbow pads,

605
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:41,370
you had to do an elbow and knee pads.
You just had to fucking do it, you know,

606
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,870
out there dressed like robocop
because when you went down you were,

607
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,550
you were fucked. And the only thing
that sucked as though the hockey gloves,

608
00:37:47,551 --> 00:37:48,331
he didn't have that thing.

609
00:37:48,331 --> 00:37:52,590
And I actually broke my wrist or broke a
bone in my wrist. I used to his eye his,

610
00:37:52,591 --> 00:37:57,060
oh my God. Way Back. Way, way, way
back. Way Back in the fucking day.

611
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:02,470
I used to play two one to
roller blade hockey at the,

612
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,550
on the top of parking
garages in West Hollywood.

613
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:12,930
Um,
I used to play in with three other comics.

614
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:18,680
It was me and Dane Cook and it was
versus through all Boston comics versus a

615
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:24,660
Rick Dalea and rest his
soul, a peak coming. And,

616
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:25,860
uh,
I remember we used to,

617
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:30,980
I remember playing the day of the
Superbowl just laughing at how insane the

618
00:38:32,401 --> 00:38:36,040
fucking weather was that it was
80 degrees out. We went out there,

619
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:40,990
had a great fucking game, super,
super highly competitive fucking game.

620
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:44,860
And we used to play at the top of the
parking garage because for whatever reason

621
00:38:44,861 --> 00:38:48,190
on like the Sundays or whatever,
they would just never,

622
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:49,240
there wouldn't be enough people.

623
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,120
No one wanted to park on the roof because
the car would get all fucking hot on

624
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:55,540
the inside and we would play up there
and sometimes someone will park up there,

625
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,160
but no one would ever rat us out.

626
00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:00,850
And only a couple of times did the ball
ever go over the edge that I remember.

627
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,010
But we always had like an extra one.
But uh,

628
00:39:03,011 --> 00:39:06,520
we do that all the time and
it was a great time. And uh,

629
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:10,300
I never understood why the
whole fucking fad went away.

630
00:39:10,301 --> 00:39:14,040
There was one homophobic joke,
one homophobic joke killed the,

631
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:18,370
what's the hardest thing about roller
blading? Telling your parents, telling,

632
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:22,690
telling your parents that you gay. That
one little joke, the whole fucking thing.

633
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:27,610
The whole thing went away. I never
understood it. I got to the point,

634
00:39:27,611 --> 00:39:31,030
I was the one that the guy who took his
break off, that was like a big thing.

635
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:33,160
And you lived in New York,
you had to be cool.

636
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:37,570
You had to take your break off and learn
how to stop the other way. Like, yeah,

637
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:42,340
why would I want to be able to stop quick
when I'm skating out in traffic with

638
00:39:42,341 --> 00:39:46,060
cabs and shit? I can't
believe I never died. Um,

639
00:39:46,061 --> 00:39:48,460
I had a couple of really close calls,
so fucking stupid.

640
00:39:48,461 --> 00:39:52,150
I would never do that again. I just
chalked that up to uh, being young.

641
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:55,390
Like I still lived in New York
and I was close to Central Park,

642
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,800
Clark Clark Park and I was going
to go rollerblading. I would,

643
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:01,450
I would at this my age,

644
00:40:01,451 --> 00:40:04,960
I would walk to the park carrying
my fucking roller blades.

645
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,900
I have no shame about it.

646
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:10,750
I know a lot of people are
embarrassed that they rollerbladed.

647
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:15,220
I have no fucking shame.
No shame.

648
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:19,540
If I lived closer to a boardwalk, I would
own a pair and I would go out there.

649
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:22,720
It's so much more fun than
doing the fucking elliptical.

650
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:27,460
It's better exercise. You know, you
put on your wireless headphones, right?

651
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,640
You tie his tee tee shirt off
at the waist and you know,

652
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:35,800
you'd go out there and you have a good
time. Maybe you have some tassels on.

653
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,380
I don't know why I am.

654
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,240
I think it's hilarious that everybody
got all fucking weird about it. Um,

655
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,180
as you can tell,
I haven't read any advertising.

656
00:40:49,181 --> 00:40:51,520
I haven't done any fucking
questions because a,

657
00:40:51,521 --> 00:40:55,600
I'm recording it early and I still
haven't gotten my materials for the week.

658
00:40:55,601 --> 00:41:00,430
Let's hit refresh. See if they
came in. Let's see. Nothing,

659
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:06,040
nothing, nothing. No
advertising, no nothing. All
right, I'll keep talking here.

660
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:09,280
I'll keep talking. I'll read the
ads and then I'll do the fucking,

661
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:15,490
I'll do the fucking, uh, what do you
call it? Uh, I'll do the questions.

662
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:19,540
All right. Um, all right. No Dad Bod.

663
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:24,430
Ernie talked about that. Oh, Billy.
No Fun. Billy. No Fun. Billy. No Fun.

664
00:41:24,431 --> 00:41:27,820
Didn't drink until Friday night.
Um,

665
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:30,880
took my nephew to the game
and after I dropped him off,

666
00:41:30,881 --> 00:41:35,881
I went back into the city and I
add a two home pores and a fucking,

667
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:38,030
uh,
an a in a cigar.

668
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:41,920
But then I didn't drink last night and
today had one cause like, just cause they,

669
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:43,790
they made the old stubby bottles again.

670
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,930
I just had to add one and it was fucking
delicious. But I don't count that.

671
00:41:47,931 --> 00:41:50,390
I just had one. I didn't
get fucked up. Um, anyways,

672
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,600
so I've been doing that shit.

673
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:59,120
Got The drinking back under control and
um, I'm going gonna find out this week,

674
00:41:59,121 --> 00:42:02,660
by the way, if there's going to be
a season three of f is for family,

675
00:42:02,661 --> 00:42:07,580
so I'm a little nervous,
um, to find out. So,

676
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:09,020
uh,
if you haven't watched it yet,

677
00:42:09,021 --> 00:42:13,970
it would really help us if you guys would
watch this week to give a nice little

678
00:42:13,971 --> 00:42:15,350
boost.
You know,

679
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:18,320
I know there's a ton of good shit out
there and know bloodline came back and it

680
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:22,940
was of you guys are working
your way through Fargo or
better call Saul. But, uh,

681
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:25,520
if you could just give us just, you
know, watch one episode, something,

682
00:42:25,521 --> 00:42:30,410
anything will help. Um, cause we're
going to find out this week. And um,

683
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,860
so anyways,
I went to the red sox Friday night.

684
00:42:33,861 --> 00:42:37,300
Saturday I came home and the angel's
game was on against the red sox cause you

685
00:42:37,301 --> 00:42:41,360
know, I get the angels feed out here
and now back into watching baseball.

686
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:47,210
I'm watching racing and I actually watched
the end of the BCA eagles versus the

687
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,310
Edmonton Eskimos.
I watched the CFL game.

688
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:54,540
I gotta tell you it was highly
entertaining because the BC eagles fucking

689
00:42:54,541 --> 00:42:55,680
defense sucks.

690
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,273
MMM.

691
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,630
One of those high scoring games or
whatever. They tied it up and then,

692
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:06,120
you know what,
lighten it up with like no time left.

693
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:11,020
And the Edmonton Eskimos go out in
the first fucking play. They gave up,

694
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:15,610
I don't know, a nice 80 yard meter,
whatever the fuck they call it,

695
00:43:15,611 --> 00:43:19,300
a kilometer of whatever they
call it up there a pass.

696
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:22,450
And then they lost the game,
kicked a field goal and it was over.

697
00:43:22,451 --> 00:43:26,830
And I had a lot of people, shit on
the CFL. It's on Tsn. It's good shit.

698
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:28,960
You know,
I look at it this way,

699
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:33,990
this is college players that
weren't good enough to make it,

700
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:38,950
you know, into the, uh,
into the NFL. But any,

701
00:43:38,951 --> 00:43:42,190
any one of those CFL teams could beat
the best fucking college team out there

702
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:46,090
cause it's made of college. All stars
like the NFL, it's college, all stars.

703
00:43:46,091 --> 00:43:48,550
The NFL is just the best of
the best college. All stars.

704
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,540
The CFL is all the college, all stars
that could not make it to the NFL.

705
00:43:52,541 --> 00:43:55,720
So it's still competitive football.
They got that giant field.

706
00:43:55,721 --> 00:43:59,980
I actually enjoyed it. Um, I dunno,

707
00:43:59,981 --> 00:44:02,950
I always watched like the Edmonton Eskimos
just because like way back in the day

708
00:44:02,951 --> 00:44:05,830
it always seem like Doug Flutie
and Warren Moon or some shit.

709
00:44:05,831 --> 00:44:10,670
We're always on those
teams. Um, but you know, I,

710
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:13,240
I don't know, BC eagles came back, so
I was like, I gotta I gotta Watch this,

711
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:17,720
I'm going to root for these guys and
they fuck the game up. Um, all right.

712
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:19,890
I don't know what else to talk about.
I'm running out of shit.

713
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:24,990
A congratulations to the lady in Australia
who breastfed in on in parliament.

714
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:31,560
I don't know why that was a big deal,
but evidently it's big deal.

715
00:44:31,561 --> 00:44:35,250
I don't know what I have to be honest
with you. My whole fucking life.

716
00:44:35,251 --> 00:44:38,520
I've never heard one guy ever say that
he had an issue with breastfeeding in

717
00:44:38,521 --> 00:44:40,560
public.
I don't know what the fucking problem is.

718
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:43,183
MMM.

719
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:47,870
I think it's more for like guys that don't
have kids yet and it like grosses him

720
00:44:47,871 --> 00:44:48,651
out because they're like,

721
00:44:48,651 --> 00:44:52,130
I want to be sticking my face in there
and now there's a baby there and that

722
00:44:52,131 --> 00:44:54,890
weirds me out and it
makes my chubby go away.

723
00:44:56,870 --> 00:45:00,710
I don't know what the deal is. I also
don't think I, but I'd be honest with you,

724
00:45:00,711 --> 00:45:03,350
I don't think you should be breastfeeding
while you're fucking, you know,

725
00:45:03,351 --> 00:45:06,280
working for your district, you know, can,

726
00:45:06,281 --> 00:45:11,060
can we have your 100% focus
here? You know, I dunno.

727
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:13,270
I guess guys could go up
there and adjust their balls.

728
00:45:13,271 --> 00:45:15,820
Is that talking about
laws? I Dunno. I Dunno why.

729
00:45:15,821 --> 00:45:18,700
I don't know what the
big deal is about it. Uh,

730
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,470
I've seen it my whole fucking life,

731
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:24,520
but I also don't know why it's treated
like somebody just landed on Mars and

732
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:28,840
came back. You know, anything
women do is now, it's just like,

733
00:45:28,841 --> 00:45:33,390
it was so great. It was so groundbreaking,
you know, they try to act like, you know,

734
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,030
they were, they weren't
Braveheart, so like you fed a baby

735
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:43,360
cause it was hungry. Um, I'm
Brian and I's shit to talk about.

736
00:45:43,361 --> 00:45:47,800
Royal blood has a new album out. Everybody
now. I didn't download their first one.

737
00:45:47,801 --> 00:45:50,950
I just downloaded that hit and I played
my drums to it a thousand times and I

738
00:45:50,951 --> 00:45:54,250
still suck at it, you know,
then something some to do,

739

740
00:45:59,111 --> 00:46:01,460
Bam, Bam. Blow blow, blow blow payment.

741
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:06,310
[inaudible] he did the cabbage do the
blue. However the fucking song goes.

742
00:46:06,311 --> 00:46:09,940
I don't even know the words.
Um,

743
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:13,840
well what did,
what did a ball?

744
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,770
Uh, royal blood has a new album
out and it got good reviews,

745
00:46:17,771 --> 00:46:21,130
so I'm going to download that
shit cause I have a fucking,

746
00:46:21,131 --> 00:46:25,000
I got a little rehearsal space. I was
over there today. I was over there today.

747
00:46:25,001 --> 00:46:28,120
I got my fucking life down. It's
perfect. Wake up in the morning.

748
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:31,780
I work out right where the kids sleep
in. My wife's sleeping. Then I run over.

749
00:46:31,781 --> 00:46:34,720
I played drums for a fucking hour.
I come back like a champ.

750
00:46:34,721 --> 00:46:38,950
I make everybody breakfast, you
know, I get my bullshit done.

751
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,020
And then in the afternoon I uh,

752
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:45,670
take my fucking precious
little baby girl for a walk.

753
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:49,150
That's it. That's it. But you know what?

754
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:53,740
My wife will still find something
to complain to me about something.

755
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:55,900
I something there'll be
something I'm doing wrong.

756
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:01,330
I just feel like I would
like it better if you,

757
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:04,450
I feel like for me. Um, all right,

758
00:47:04,451 --> 00:47:07,270
this is the last thing that I got to hit
pause until this fucking shit comes in.

759
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:12,460
Uh, the questions here, come on
man. Send the fucking questions.

760
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:17,560
Refresh button. Hit the refresh button.
Bill. Hit the refresh button. Nothing.

761
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:24,930
Wait a minute. I'm an asshole.
Ah, it was in the wrong account.

762
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:28,670
What an asshole.
What?

763
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,670
And that is the kind of guy who
doesn't know the difference between

764
00:47:30,671 --> 00:47:32,380
photosynthesis and pollination

765
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:39,400
fighting out of the blue corner.
Here we go. Oh, and Lo and behold,

766
00:47:39,401 --> 00:47:42,910
there it is and we go out.
It's time for some advertising.

767
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:44,290
I was just going to
give you guys a fun bit.

768
00:47:44,370 --> 00:47:48,340
Baseball fact remind me when I come
back, he can't, but I'll, I'll, you know.

769
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,950
All right.
Oh Boto

770
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:54,630
Doh, me, undies, me undies.
They used to be two.

771
00:47:54,631 --> 00:47:59,631
All Star Games do do to to me on
these B and e's between 1959 in 1960

772
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:04,790
too. And everybody went up
to plate. Their balls hurt.

773
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:09,700
They didn't know what to do cause the
suits were made a wall in have far,

774
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:13,080
that one sucked. I gotta take two on that
one. I tried to give you the all state.

775
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:18,170
There was two all star games
in 1959 60 61 and I believe 62.

776
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:22,220
Um, I might as well give it to you now,
right? Might as well tell it to you.

777
00:48:22,221 --> 00:48:26,510
Why not? You know why it is. Do you know
why they had to all star games? Not,

778
00:48:26,511 --> 00:48:28,550
because you know,
people couldn't afford to travel.

779
00:48:28,551 --> 00:48:31,820
So they had one on the east coast,
one on the west coast. It wasn't that,

780
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:36,650
it wasn't every, okay.
It turns out that, uh,

781
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:40,160
playing of the second game was intended
to increase the amount of money going to

782
00:48:40,161 --> 00:48:43,910
the players pension fund.
Uh, this person says,

783
00:48:43,911 --> 00:48:45,860
I wish there was a
neater reason than that,

784
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:50,890
like gambling demands or trial
formation of an allstar league,

785
00:48:51,290 --> 00:48:53,210
which would be made up of
two teams of all stars.

786
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:56,960
I played each other a hundred times a
season, but nope. Pension Fund. That's it.

787
00:48:56,961 --> 00:49:01,520
And everybody realized by 1962 or
so that the arrangement was dumb.

788
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:05,360
Uh, the public at large is
finding a second all star game,

789
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:09,530
something of an anticlimax like playing
a second world series in Brazil.

790
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:13,750
So 1951, 1960, 61,

791
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:19,100
1959, sorry, 60 61. They played
to all star Games. There you go.

792
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:23,870
And I learned that this weekend when I
saw a pennant from Fenway about the 1961

793
00:49:23,871 --> 00:49:27,020
all star games and they called the
Cincinnati reds, by the way, the red legs,

794
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:30,260
which I had never heard of
either. Hey Bill, why don't
you get to the advertising?

795
00:49:30,261 --> 00:49:33,140
Because that was some of the most boring
shit I've ever listened to in my life.

796
00:49:33,141 --> 00:49:37,570
Hey, hey. Hey. Fair enough. Oh, but

797
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:44,070
Doto Mandy's me undies. Mind you fucking
cues and ps to do to to me undies.

798
00:49:44,071 --> 00:49:45,340
Me undies.

799
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:49,430
I can't fucking sing it this week.
I've got nothing this week.

800
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:53,270
My brain is fried for my dollars.
Roast jokes.

801
00:49:53,271 --> 00:49:56,740
I thought if I was ended with peas
and gave me some Orion's, we undies,

802
00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:02,160
Mandy's man, you fucking p's

Don't pee pee or do the Doodoo and

no one will care because it'll be soft
and cradle the air in the chain of your

Okay.

914
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:56,880
Jesus Christ says a fucking mouthful at
a nonprofit that helps young adolescents

00:57:47,971 --> 00:57:52,920
I feel great about myself
from a fellow adult. Ooh.

930
00:57:52,921 --> 00:57:57,020
Little shade there in the end.
I Dunno dude. Three drinks.

931

932
00:58:01,601 --> 00:58:06,150
What kind of drinks?
Um, all right, here's,

933
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:09,540
here's one for you buddy.
I drank probably over 300 days last year.

934
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,690
I don't feel good about myself.
Um,

935
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:16,500
and me needing to shut it down in no
way should make you feel self conscious

936
00:58:16,501 --> 00:58:19,920
about what you're doing to the point you
have to be contained to me and say you

937
00:58:19,921 --> 00:58:24,180
feel great about yourself. Um, all
right. That's it. So good for you.

938
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:26,790
Keep having three drinks a night and
feel good about yourself when you don't

939
00:58:26,791 --> 00:58:30,100
feel good about yourself. Shut it
down. You know what I'll do? I'll yet

940
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:36,530
cancer charity sham. Oh,
here we go. Here we go.

941
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:38,900
Here's another one.
Here's another one.

942
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:45,400
In a rare joint action with the attorney
or attorneys general for each of the 50

943
00:58:46,491 --> 00:58:47,060
states,

944
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:51,710
the Federal Trade Commission says for
cancer charities run by extended members

945
00:58:51,890 --> 00:58:54,800
of the same family con donors out of a

946
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:01,960
$187 million from 2008 to 2012 and spent
almost nothing to help actual cancer

947
00:59:02,211 --> 00:59:05,870
patients. And what happens to these
people? Are they going to go to jail?

948
00:59:09,350 --> 00:59:10,910
Children's cancer fund.

949
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:12,280
Okay.

950
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:13,720
All right.
Let's see.

951
00:59:13,721 --> 00:59:18,280
In a rare bubba by read each of the
charities charge where the subject of

952
00:59:18,281 --> 00:59:21,040
extensive reporting by CNN in 2013 I,

953
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:24,620
cause I remember this story and in each
instance none of the four charities

954
00:59:24,621 --> 00:59:25,454
would comment.

955
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:29,540
We were ordered out of the building at
the cancer fund of America in Knoxville,

956
00:59:29,541 --> 00:59:34,280
Tennessee, home of the
Tennessee volunteers, uh,

957
00:59:34,281 --> 00:59:38,690
and worthy object of an abyss of an
obscene gesture by the CEO of the breast

958
00:59:38,691 --> 00:59:40,640
cancer society. Am I,
that's usually, you know,

959
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:42,230
that's usually a good
sign that it's bullshit.

960
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:46,670
If you're raising money for cancer for
a to help kids stricken with cancer and

961
00:59:46,671 --> 00:59:50,480
you're the CEO and you give the finger
of media which is going to help promote,

962
00:59:50,481 --> 00:59:51,620
yeah,
that's probably a good sign.

963
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:56,030
The Cancer Fund of America is run
by James rendered senior, his son,

964
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:58,550
James Ronald Jr.
This is all alleged by the way,

965
00:59:58,551 --> 01:00:02,840
before these scumbags allegedly
start to sue me for reading.

966
01:00:02,841 --> 01:00:06,230
This is the CEO of the breast
cancer society. Another charity,

967
01:00:06,231 --> 01:00:09,920
the child's cancer fund of
America is run by Rose Perkins,

968
01:00:09,921 --> 01:00:14,420
the ex wife of the elder James Reynolds.
He is. He's also the CEO of the Fourth

969
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:18,673
Charity Cancer Support
Support Server Services.

970
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:22,280
Ah, wow. Wow. Well,

971
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:25,590
if they are doing dirt, I hope they get
caught and they'd go to fucking jail.

972
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:27,953
Yeah.

973
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:31,340
Jesus Christ. Man. That is
like some sociopath shit.

974
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:34,520
Jesus Christ.

975
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:39,510
Oh my God. And you going out
and buying like a fucking,

976
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:44,250
when I buy yourself a raptor,
like a fucking,

977
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:49,040
what could you be? Here's something
for you. What could you by yourself

978
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:52,370
with,
with cancer.

979
01:00:53,290 --> 01:00:53,730
Okay.

980
01:00:53,730 --> 01:00:56,850
Shit that was supposed to go to it to
help kids. What could you by yourself?

981
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:01,350
Oh my God, that that is that. I
mean that is just added. It's just,

982
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,470
that's on another fucking level.

983
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:08,860
I think even bankers would be like,
really do Jesus Christ.

984
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:14,430
How about a little fucking little
bit of tact? Something. Um,

985
01:01:15,030 --> 01:01:18,950
alright. Transgender habits. A Billy
muffin top. Aww, that's so true.

986
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:23,960
I listened to Andrew. Yeah.
Had a few months ago, maybe
even a few years ago. Oh,

987
01:01:23,961 --> 01:01:25,820
Jesus. Sorry. Losing credibility.

988
01:01:25,821 --> 01:01:29,630
I can't remember the last month or
2010 I heard a segment you might be

989
01:01:29,631 --> 01:01:32,510
interested in.
I believe it was this American life,

990
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:36,410
but they asked a transgendered man,
uh,

991
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:38,373
okay.

992
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:41,850
I don't know what they mean. A woman
becoming a man. I get it. I think, uh,

993
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:46,550
if there was any interesting changing,
well he talked about after his transition,

994
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:48,950
he was now more into science,

995
01:01:49,490 --> 01:01:54,410
was way more interested in sex and wasn't
able to access his emotions as much

996
01:01:54,411 --> 01:01:55,244
anymore.

997
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:56,790
Okay.

998
01:01:56,790 --> 01:01:58,950
Oh,
so those are basically guy things.

999
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:00,020
Yeah.

1000
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:00,980
That's kind of interesting.

1001
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,860
I would think way more interested in
sex because you're finally is sex.

1002
01:02:03,861 --> 01:02:08,580
You want to be science
that's really interesting and
weren't able to access your

1003
01:02:08,581 --> 01:02:12,690
emotions for, I dunno. I have no
idea. That's, well, there you go.

1004
01:02:12,691 --> 01:02:16,770
So maybe I wasn't wrong thinking that
somebody's habits changed a female

1005
01:02:16,771 --> 01:02:20,670
privilege. Hey Man, uh, love your podcast.

1006
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:23,940
Hope your family's doing great.
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1007
01:02:23,941 --> 01:02:27,540
Wasn't that Nice of you? My family is
doing great. My daughter is awesome.

1008
01:02:27,570 --> 01:02:31,540
And my wife, I have a whole new
level of love for watching a Bmr. No.

1009
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:35,730
Have a read at this article
when you get a chance.

1010
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,430
Uh, okay. Female nurse found
guilty of dangerous driving,

1011
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:45,840
causing death to be sentenced.
Do I want to read this?

1012
01:02:45,841 --> 01:02:47,830
There weren't any kids involved
in this. This, this gone.

1013
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:50,910
We already saw a potential scam.

1014
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:55,500
Okay. Be Seniors found
guilty of dangerous driving,

1015
01:02:55,501 --> 01:02:58,440
causing death sentenced
to 90 days in jail.

1016
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:02,220
The families of two young people are
angry over a dangerous driving sentence,

1017
01:03:02,221 --> 01:03:04,920
giving the woman who killed them.
Okay.

1018
01:03:04,921 --> 01:03:06,890
The be seniors found guilty
of dangerous driving,

1019
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:13,560
causing death to two people's been
sentenced to 90 days in jail and

1020
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:20,300
Alina Hesi Mobic was driving
at high speeds through pet
pit meadows. And October,

1021
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:21,380
2010 she ran a red light,

1022
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:26,381
jumped a concrete median and slammed
into a car carrying Becky Dyer 19 and

1023
01:03:29,181 --> 01:03:34,181
Johnny d all Avera 21 the couple who were
on their way home from a concert where

1024
01:03:35,391 --> 01:03:38,900
killed instantly along
with the 90 day sentence.

1025
01:03:39,850 --> 01:03:42,380
Hesi Mobic also received
two years probation,

1026
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:45,770
120 hours of community service in
three years driving probation. Yeah.

1027
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:49,543
MMM.

1028
01:03:49,970 --> 01:03:50,650
Yeah.

1029
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:55,000
She will serve her sentence intermittently
between Tuesdays and Thursdays around

1030
01:03:55,001 --> 01:03:59,190
her work schedule.
Oh my God.

1031
01:03:59,191 --> 01:04:02,250
What a joke. Diyers mother. Debbie said,

1032
01:04:02,390 --> 01:04:05,550
this sentence is not showing the public
that our justice system actually is a

1033
01:04:05,551 --> 01:04:08,130
justice system.
It's actually a legal system.

1034
01:04:08,310 --> 01:04:11,090
It's not going to deter other
drivers from doing the same.

1035
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:17,250
Oh my God. D all of error. Mom,
Audrey echoed the same sentiment.

1036
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,290
Six years is a long time.

1037
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:24,310
She's put everybody through and
she's only getting a little bit here.

1038
01:04:24,311 --> 01:04:26,590
A little bit there. It's
wrong. Yeah. That's terrible.

1039
01:04:27,770 --> 01:04:27,890
Okay.

1040
01:04:27,890 --> 01:04:29,210
That's fucking terrible.

1041
01:04:32,930 --> 01:04:34,370
That's fucking horrible.

1042
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:35,340
Yeah.

1043
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:38,880
You know, at some point when you're
driving that fast, you do. I mean,

1044
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:42,990
I think those laws are all
going to change. I know they
have with drunk driving.

1045
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:44,550
Okay.

1046
01:04:44,550 --> 01:04:48,180
I think because she wasn't drunk
in jails are all filled up,

1047
01:04:48,181 --> 01:04:50,820
at least in this country.
Like I don't understand that.

1048
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:56,580
But I mean your life should be
tremendously effective if you,

1049
01:04:56,630 --> 01:05:00,580
if you were driving that fucking fast
and then killed two innocent people.

1050
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:02,540
Yeah.

1051
01:05:02,540 --> 01:05:05,420
I think the whole, well, she's never
committed a crime. She's a nurse.

1052
01:05:05,421 --> 01:05:07,730
She's a productive member of society.

1053
01:05:07,731 --> 01:05:10,700
I think a lot of that goes
out the fucking window. Well,

1054
01:05:10,701 --> 01:05:13,850
she did something tremendously stupid.
And now two people are dead forever.

1055
01:05:14,540 --> 01:05:17,290
So at the very least you can
do 90 straight days in jail.

1056
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,230
What do you say there and yeah,

1057
01:05:20,231 --> 01:05:22,090
I guess you'll have to figure
out what you're going to fail.

1058
01:05:22,091 --> 01:05:26,470
You're going to find another job after
that. What kind of cool job does she have?

1059
01:05:26,650 --> 01:05:27,880
I have to be on jail.

1060
01:05:27,881 --> 01:05:32,881
I've been in jail on Tuesday and
Thursdays because I killed two people on

1061
01:05:33,401 --> 01:05:36,790
Tuesday. I go to jail for the
woman I killed on Thursday.

1062
01:05:36,791 --> 01:05:40,300
I go to jail for the guy I killed.
Felt like,

1063
01:05:40,301 --> 01:05:43,570
can I work like Monday,
not Wednesdays.

1064
01:05:43,571 --> 01:05:47,680
So there'll be like so tired
from being jail from one day. Um,

1065
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:52,510
can I work like Monday, Friday,
Saturday and a half day Sunday?

1066
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:58,270
Uh, that's, yeah. That's disgusting.
Fucking disgusting. All right.

1067
01:05:58,271 --> 01:06:02,980
My girlfriend is becoming a
feminist. Hey there, daddy bald.

1068
01:06:02,981 --> 01:06:07,150
Freckle. First of all, English
is, isn't my mother tongue.

1069
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:10,030
So sorry if I fucked up a bit. All
right. I was wondering why that

1070
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:15,440
I could just see you googling daddy bold,

1071
01:06:15,950 --> 01:06:18,640
freckle and just mash a muscle
and I would've done all right.

1072
01:06:18,650 --> 01:06:23,030
And I'm 33 years old and I'm an 18 and
18 months relationship with a terrific

1073
01:06:23,031 --> 01:06:25,820
girl. After four rather
unsuccessful relationship,

1074
01:06:25,821 --> 01:06:30,340
I finally had the feeling
she could be the one, uh, um,

1075
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:33,320
she has her flaws like every
person, but hey, so do I.

1076
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:37,160
But when it comes down to the important
features like honesty, moral values,

1077
01:06:37,161 --> 01:06:40,190
similar lifestyles and interests,
she really is my match.

1078
01:06:40,220 --> 01:06:43,770
And to top it all off in bed,
it never gets boring. Dude,

1079
01:06:43,771 --> 01:06:47,600
this is your second language. This is
great. She's more on the submissive side.

1080
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:51,560
Maybe you just fucking with me. And he
deliberately wrote a bad in cell. Um,

1081
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:53,090
she's more in the submit for this side.

1082
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:58,360
If you understand wink and some
things sometimes get wild gross,

1083
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:03,380
gross. I now have no sympathy
for you, but in a very nice way.

1084
01:07:03,381 --> 01:07:07,130
He tries to say after our
sexy time session gross,

1085
01:07:07,550 --> 01:07:11,330
we lay next to each other comp.
Ah,

1086
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:16,070
completely out of breath
feeling like nothing can touch.

1087
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:20,000
His sounds cheesy but it's
really beautiful. Why did
you go into all that detail?

1088
01:07:20,510 --> 01:07:22,490
Oh my God,
that was disgusting.

1089
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:26,780
They ever tell you guys how much I can't
stand watching people kiss in public on

1090
01:07:26,781 --> 01:07:29,480
film or any of that. It's, it's
the grossest fucking thing ever.

1091
01:07:34,490 --> 01:07:39,260
Keep your intimacies to yourself.
Now we have a long distance relationship.

1092
01:07:39,261 --> 01:07:43,250
We are far away but we still eat.
You see still see each other quite often.

1093
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:49,050
Five times per year,
but then usually weeks at a time too.

1094
01:07:49,051 --> 01:07:53,610
What the fuck just happened?
What? Johanna will just happen.

1095
01:07:55,890 --> 01:07:58,040
There was a,
was there a jump in time here?

1096
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,720
Was there some time travel going on here?

1097
01:07:59,990 --> 01:08:04,100
She lives in Europe and has been hanging
out with these feminist activist girls

1098
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:07,070
and she's bringing up the topic of sexism,
et Cetera.

1099
01:08:07,071 --> 01:08:11,080
More and more lately now I was raised
by a proud mother from, oh Jesus.

1100
01:08:11,090 --> 01:08:13,190
Is there any other kind,
proud,

1101
01:08:13,191 --> 01:08:16,700
strong woman and could not
imagine dating a girl that has,

1102
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:22,180
has values of women out of
the 1950s I like confident,

1103
01:08:22,221 --> 01:08:24,770
proud women. This is what he always
sets himself up to be a good guy.

1104
01:08:24,771 --> 01:08:28,610
They can hold their own. But even though
I am not a chauvinist by any means,

1105
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:33,950
I think the modern feminist movement,
similar to Vegans, annoying the living,

1106
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:38,000
annoys the living hell out of me.
I get that there is sexism in this world,

1107
01:08:38,001 --> 01:08:40,100
but I don't see the huge problem in it,

1108
01:08:40,130 --> 01:08:44,210
especially since the western societies
have made such progress in this field in

1109
01:08:44,211 --> 01:08:47,630
the past decades. Yeah.
I mean, I don't know.

1110
01:08:47,631 --> 01:08:50,690
You keep talking yourself back
into the holder. Yeah. Like a,

1111
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:54,980
like a total psycho 100% feminist maniac.
Yeah.

1112
01:08:54,981 --> 01:08:55,910
You don't wanna be around that.

1113
01:08:56,150 --> 01:08:59,990
It's literally like being
around a conspiracy theorist
after awhile as far as,

1114
01:09:00,110 --> 01:09:02,930
they're never going to shut the fuck up
about that topic and it's gonna drive

1115
01:09:02,931 --> 01:09:05,150
you nuts after awhile.
Um,

1116
01:09:05,570 --> 01:09:09,530
do you realize that every day 40% of women
are going to be throwing stats at you?

1117
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:14,300
Like someone who plays fantasy
football? Um, anyway, he says today,

1118
01:09:14,301 --> 01:09:18,090
my girlfriends sent me a link to an
article about how pornography objectifies

1119
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:21,050
his discriminates women.
Then she wrote,

1120
01:09:21,051 --> 01:09:25,220
I've been thinking a lot lately and how
to change some things in the future,

1121
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:29,870
especially in our sex life. Yeah,
dude, this relationship is over a now.

1122
01:09:29,871 --> 01:09:34,400
I tend to agree with now I tend to agree
with this auto button. Nevertheless,

1123
01:09:34,490 --> 01:09:36,080
I furiously your pied,
Hey,

1124
01:09:36,081 --> 01:09:39,680
if you're going to turn into one of
the these nonstop nagging feminist,

1125
01:09:39,681 --> 01:09:44,681
please tell me now so I can even move
the fuck further away from you and your

1126
01:09:45,661 --> 01:09:50,520
victim seeking miserable friends.
Yeah, dude, you're kind of an asshole.

1127
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,260
You're kind of an asshole.

1128
01:09:53,450 --> 01:09:54,283
MMM.

1129
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:57,360
Slash a bit of a control freak I think.
I Dunno.

1130
01:09:57,390 --> 01:10:00,900
But then you're cool with her moving away.
I don't know. I can't read you. He goes,

1131
01:10:00,901 --> 01:10:02,820
then things escalated quickly.
Yeah.

1132
01:10:02,821 --> 01:10:06,330
You think we got into a big fight and
haven't communicated since? Yeah. Dude,

1133
01:10:06,331 --> 01:10:10,080
it's so rapid. It was already a rep.
It was already a wrap. You know,

1134
01:10:10,110 --> 01:10:14,160
if you just imagine if you
got into something. Okay.

1135
01:10:14,190 --> 01:10:17,730
And then you came home and whatever
your new fucking way of thinking was.

1136
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:22,050
You told your wife or girlfriend that
she needed to adjust some things in the

1137
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:25,170
bedroom? I mean, try that
one on for size. Yeah.

1138
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:29,580
What it is is she's grown in a
different direction and she needs to be,

1139
01:10:31,050 --> 01:10:35,650
um, you know, I don't, I don't know.
She was with a different type of guy.

1140
01:10:35,710 --> 01:10:37,570
Not You. Now Bill, this is a girl.

1141
01:10:37,810 --> 01:10:42,220
This girl is great and smart and Tbh.
I don't know what that means.

1142
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:46,450
I am all for women's rights and see
sexism on a daily basis and totally

1143
01:10:46,451 --> 01:10:47,400
understand some of them.
Yeah.

1144
01:10:47,401 --> 01:10:50,050
I was stopped fucking making
yourself out to be the hero.

1145
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:54,160
Oh no one of these guys.
But I'm not one of these guys,

1146
01:10:54,161 --> 01:10:58,150
so leave me the fuck alone with this stuff
and if this stuff will interfere with

1147
01:10:58,151 --> 01:11:00,730
our sex life and change the woman
that I have learned to love,

1148
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:02,890
I don't know where this will leave us.
What do you think of this?

1149
01:11:02,891 --> 01:11:06,160
Am I being too non empathetic here?
It's been,

1150
01:11:06,161 --> 01:11:09,880
I don't think you're an empathetic person.
Um,

1151
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:13,620
I would say that, uh, yeah, I this a wrap.

1152
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:17,430
This is not the kind of
woman you're looking for. Um,

1153
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:18,740
yeah.

1154
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:21,710
And this is a major change
in her. All right. I mean,

1155
01:11:21,711 --> 01:11:23,840
I don't know what goes on between the two
of you, but if she's going to be like,

1156
01:11:23,841 --> 01:11:28,100
hey, watch this and we need to change
some stuff in the bedroom, like the,

1157
01:11:28,130 --> 01:11:31,970
the relationship as you know,
it is over and uh,

1158
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:36,890
and it's long distance. I mean,
yeah, it's, it's a fucking rap.

1159
01:11:37,820 --> 01:11:41,840
I would walk away. Um, alright.
Fucked up at, at pet shop.

1160
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:47,940
Last one here. Fucked
up at the pet shop he's

1161
01:11:50,670 --> 01:11:54,620
with. Did Ghost pet shop boys. That's
right. And I fucked up at pet shop.

1162
01:11:54,650 --> 01:11:58,130
How's it going? Oh,
Billy Bordeaux. Bullocks.

1163
01:11:59,870 --> 01:12:03,200
Um, love the podcast. Congrats
to the day. Thank you very much.

1164
01:12:04,730 --> 01:12:08,810
All the great work onF is for family
baggies to having left at anything so hard

1165
01:12:08,811 --> 01:12:11,780
and long time old. Billy,
I fucked up recently,

1166
01:12:11,781 --> 01:12:15,560
but no one knows I've done anything wrong.
I work at a pet shop,

1167
01:12:15,590 --> 01:12:18,170
we sell rabbits and mice,
things like that.

1168
01:12:18,171 --> 01:12:20,480
And my job is to feed them
and clean their cages.

1169
01:12:20,481 --> 01:12:21,830
I already don't like where this is going.

1170
01:12:22,910 --> 01:12:24,440
Not the most exciting thing in the world,

1171
01:12:24,441 --> 01:12:26,900
but I love animals and they
look so sad a lot of the time.

1172
01:12:26,901 --> 01:12:29,870
So I try to make their lives a little
better by looking after them the best I

1173
01:12:29,871 --> 01:12:33,770
can. That's what I would do if I worked
at a pet store. Long Story Short,

1174
01:12:34,460 --> 01:12:35,480
I'm fairly new.

1175
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:39,830
So the first day I was taught how to
tell the male rabbits from the female

1176
01:12:39,831 --> 01:12:43,700
rabbits. It turns out you have
to feel for the testicles,

1177
01:12:43,910 --> 01:12:48,110
which wasn't that hard as a lot of the
rabbits had really big balls like holy

1178
01:12:48,111 --> 01:12:52,910
shit. And I was pretty confident that
I could do it in the future. God,

1179
01:12:52,911 --> 01:12:56,930
these are weird this week. Fast forward
to Monday, turns out I cannot do it.

1180
01:12:57,470 --> 01:13:02,470
We've got a whole load of new lion had
rabbits in with massive for making it

1181
01:13:03,891 --> 01:13:06,380
almost impossible to locate the balls.

1182
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:09,540
Well just flick them between the legs.

1183
01:13:09,541 --> 01:13:12,450
If the rabbit turns around like what the
fuck was that for it? She has a pussy.

1184
01:13:13,450 --> 01:13:17,850
If you fucking flake it between the
legs and the thing collapses, you know,

1185
01:13:17,970 --> 01:13:21,410
and lays there for 30 seconds while
his other friends laugh at him. Uh,

1186
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:25,140
that is a male. And the ones laughing.
Well, women laugh at that shit too.

1187
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:30,390
Anyways, at that stage it was
just me and one of the student,

1188
01:13:30,391 --> 01:13:33,270
part time workers who probably had
just learned to locate his own balls,

1189
01:13:33,271 --> 01:13:37,940
let alone someone else's. Uh, why is
this a big deal? Well, I can tell you,

1190
01:13:38,590 --> 01:13:40,560
I think you can figure out,
we can,

1191
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:44,040
why we can't put the males
in with the females bill.

1192
01:13:44,041 --> 01:13:45,780
I seriously don't know
what the fuck happened,

1193
01:13:45,781 --> 01:13:50,010
but I went home that evening having no
idea if I was going to arrive back into

1194
01:13:50,011 --> 01:13:54,270
work with double the number of rabbits.
I know that's not how gestation works,

1195
01:13:54,271 --> 01:13:57,780
but fuck it. Uh, what would you
do if you were in my situation?

1196
01:13:57,781 --> 01:14:00,000
I just started working
here and I really like it,

1197
01:14:00,001 --> 01:14:04,590
but I have no idea how to explain how I
fucked this up so badly. Thanks. Well,

1198
01:14:04,591 --> 01:14:05,424
what happened?

1199
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:11,320
We've got a whole new low of new lion,

1200
01:14:11,321 --> 01:14:15,040
had rabbits in with massive for making
it almost impossible. So what is this,

1201
01:14:15,041 --> 01:14:16,150
what is the problem here?

1202
01:14:16,180 --> 01:14:19,150
You're worried that you're going to put
them in with the wrong ones and a calf?

1203
01:14:19,151 --> 01:14:23,580
Fuck. Oh my God. I just dropped
my fucking laptop and Mike Foot.

1204
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:29,110
Ah, Jesus Christ. Um, I don't
know what the problem is, sir.

1205
01:14:29,410 --> 01:14:33,760
What I would do is I would come clean
before you have 7,000 rabbits and they got

1206
01:14:33,761 --> 01:14:37,420
to feed them to the snakes.
That's what I would do. All right.

1207
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:41,590
How hard is it to find fucking balls?

1208
01:14:43,810 --> 01:14:48,730
I'd put on a glove. Then I
go, you like underneath them,

1209
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:52,810
you know, dead had a boot and
a button up. I don't know.

1210
01:14:52,811 --> 01:14:55,210
I don't know what you're out of my year.
I'm out of my element.

1211
01:14:55,570 --> 01:14:58,030
I don't know what to tell you.
I don't know how to find rabbit balls.

1212
01:14:58,390 --> 01:15:01,480
I would definitely come clean and say
that you think you fucking messed up

1213
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:05,590
because a, the fact that you're running
from this problem like that guy in Fargo.

1214
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,310
Ah gees. I'm going to get you the
numbers like you doing that right now.

1215
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:10,870
All right?

1216
01:15:10,870 --> 01:15:15,820
And I'm afraid you're going to end up
blaming the fucking college student.

1217
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:18,310
All right? So I would just come
clean. Say that you fucked up.

1218
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:22,080
I don't think they're going to fire
you over it. You know what I mean? Uh,

1219
01:15:22,090 --> 01:15:24,310
that's what I would do and I would
learn how to find rabbit balls.

1220
01:15:24,330 --> 01:15:27,880
I would get into another line of
business. All right? Okay. There you go.

1221
01:15:27,881 --> 01:15:32,170
