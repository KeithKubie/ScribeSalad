I WASN'T EXPECTING THAT.

00:00:22.968 --> 00:00:24.901

TO ASK CHIEF TECHNOLOGIST
MIKE DOYLE

00:00:32.067 --> 00:00:36.133

AND IT'S MEANT TO REPLICATE
THE WEIGHT OF AN AIRCRAFT.

00:00:46.634 --> 00:00:48.200
DEAD LOADS ARE CHEAP.

'CAUSE IT ACTUALLY CAUSES DAMAGE
TO THE DEAD LOAD WHEN IT HITS.

SO, THE TIRES GET RIPPED OFF,

TO ALL THE INSTRUMENTATION.

00:01:09.901 --> 00:01:12.901
TO GET THIS SLED TO BOUNCE,
YOU NEED A LOT OF SPEED.

00:01:12.901 --> 00:01:15.334
WHEN IT LEAVES
THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER,

00:01:15.334 --> 00:01:18.934
IT'S MOVING AT A SPEED
OF 150 MILES PER HOUR,

00:01:18.934 --> 00:01:21.467
OR 240 KILOMETERS PER HOUR.

00:01:21.467 --> 00:01:24.200
WHEN THE SLED
MAKES CONTACT WITH THE WATER,

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.167
IT'S EXERTING A HUGE FORCE

00:01:26.167 --> 00:01:29.200
OVER A LARGE SURFACE AREA
VERY QUICKLY.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.634
AND IT DOESN'T GIVE TIME
FOR THE WATER

00:01:31.634 --> 00:01:34.400
TO GET OUT OF THE WAY
AND ABSORB THAT FORCE.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.601
SO, INSTEAD, IT PUSHES BACK.

00:01:36.601 --> 00:01:38.934
Oluseyi: THE SLED COMES IN
AT A VERY SHALLOW ANGLE.

00:01:38.934 --> 00:01:41.734
AND AS A CONSEQUENCE,
MOST OF THE SLED'S MOMENTUM

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:44.601
IS IN THE FORWARD DIRECTION
RATHER THAN DOWNWARDS,

00:01:44.601 --> 00:01:47.167
SO ONCE THE WATER
PUSHES THE SLED IN THE AIR,

00:01:47.167 --> 00:01:48.400
IT CONTINUES FORWARD.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.033
AND, THUS, IT'S SKIPPING
ACROSS THE WATER.

00:01:52.033 --> 00:01:56.334
THE SYSTEM THAT HAS THE POWER
TO THROW THIS HEAVY SLED SO FAST

00:01:56.334 --> 00:01:57.734
IS CALLED EMALS --

ELECTROMAGNETIC AIRCRAFT
LAUNCH SYSTEM.

00:02:00.734 --> 00:02:04.834
THIS TRACK IS MADE UP OF AN
ARRAY OF ELECTROMAGNETIC COILS.

00:02:04.834 --> 00:02:08.634
EACH COIL IS TURNED ON
OR TURNED OFF IN SEQUENCE,

00:02:08.634 --> 00:02:11.267
MAKING SURE THAT
THE COIL IN FRONT

00:02:11.267 --> 00:02:12.968
IS PULLING THE SLED FORWARD

00:02:12.968 --> 00:02:15.834
WHILE THE COIL BEHIND
IS PUSHING IT FORWARD,

00:02:15.834 --> 00:02:18.968
ALLOWING THE SLED
TO ACCELERATE RAPIDLY.

00:02:18.968 --> 00:02:20.701
THERE IS
AN INCREDIBLE FUN FACTOR

00:02:20.701 --> 00:02:22.067
