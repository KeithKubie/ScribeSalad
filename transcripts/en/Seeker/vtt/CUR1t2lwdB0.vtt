00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.480
Oh god I can’t breathe.

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:05.279
Why do I feel like the oxygen is leaving the
room?

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.350
WHAT IF THE OXYGEN IS LEAVING THE PLANET

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:12.870
Hey Guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.860
Well I’ve got some good news and I’ve
got some bad news.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:16.860
Bad news first.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.270
Our atmosphere is leaking.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.270
But so are the atmospheres of a lot of other
planets.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.930
When the solar system first formed most heavenly
bodies had the same ratio of elements in their

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:26.930
atmosphere.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.720
But over billions of years, things.. changed.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.989
It’s a natural process, part of the ever
changing nature of the universe.

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:40.390
Earth's atmosphere currently is around 78%
nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 0.9% argon, and 0.03%

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:41.390
carbon dioxide.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.710
A seemingly perfect ratio of life.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.280
But it didn’t always look that way.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.389
According to researchers like Professor Ian
Plimer of Adelaide University and Professor

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:55.870
Jon Harrison of the University of Arizona,
oxygen levels in the atmosphere in prehistoric

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.079
times averaged around 30% to 35%.

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.269
Atmospheres can change in a number of ways.

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:04.620
Sometimes the atmosphere lifts off in a huge
chunk.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.100
In thermal escape like "hydrodynamic escape",
the gases in the atmosphere get too hot from

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.290
the intense heat of the sun, and they evaporate
away.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.830
Atmosphere can be released more slowly through
nonthermal processes.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.050
Which is basically like when molecules bounce
off each other, throwing atoms into space.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.870
And sometimes the atmosphere is blasted into
space by the impact from asteroids and comets.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:25.950
Take Mars for example.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.270
One of our nearest neighbors holds some of
the most enduring mysteries.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.520
Simply because it’s so similar to Earth,
yet so different.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.120
It’s atmosphere is over 95% carbon dioxide.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.490
So what happened to it?

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.850
Well Mars lost most of its atmosphere 3.8
billion years ago.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.030
According to the Encyclopedia of Paleoclimatology
and Ancient Environments, Mars might have

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.000
lost 90% of its atmosphere over time.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.050
It’s smaller than Earth with less mass,
there’s less gravitational pull.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.140
So it was kind of easy for the atmosphere
to just dissipate into the expanse of space.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.800
Some of it was stripped off from solar wind,
while some of it got flung into space by the

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.810
crash of meteorites according to a study published
in the journal Science.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.270
So could that happen to Earth?

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.829
Well it already did.

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:12.269
Earth is a little different, we are wrapped
up in a magnetic shield that protects us from

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.780
some of the sun’s damaging solar winds.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.299
So our atmosphere hasn’t eroded as much
as other planets.

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:21.379
But that doesn’t mean we’re immune, one
study published in the journal Icarus suggests

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:27.080
that thousands of impacts from space rocks
ejected most of Earth’s atmosphere 4.5 billion

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.080
years ago.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.859
While that’s in the past, we’re still
losing our atmosphere, though at a tiny rate.

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:34.370
Remember how I mentioned that magnetic shield?

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.069
While it does protect us from some of the
most damaging solar winds, it also leaks tiny

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.400
amounts of the atmosphere into space.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.400
As the sun’s energy gets absorbed, it’s
guided into the upper atmosphere.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.079
There it heats up some of the molecules, which
leave the Earth along the same channels that

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:50.790
let the energy in.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.280
So Earth is losing atmosphere at about a rate
of 5×1025 (five by ten to the 25th power)

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.639
molecules per second (50,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000).
which is faster than our neighbors like Mars

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:03.739
are losing theirs, according to research presented
at the European Geosciences Union General

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.099
Assembly meeting in 2013.

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.470
But before you freak out, you should know
there’s nothing to worry about.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.609
You can breathe easy, so says one of the lead
researchers Hans Nilsson.

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:17.599
If that rate stays the same, we’ve got a
few billion years left of a decent atmosphere.

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.709
And by then, we’ll have MUCH bigger problems
to worry about.

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.489
Like the sun expanding and wiping out all
life as we know it.

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.050
FUN TIMES GUYS.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:31.349
Solar storms could throw us back into the
stone ages by wiping out all electricity in

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:42.920
the world.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.209
Alright so what kind of galactic disaster
are you worried about?
