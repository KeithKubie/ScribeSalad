00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.890
I am not a handy man; If I can’t fix something
by hitting it, rebooting it, or blowing on

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:05.890
it, I’m sunk.

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.820
But am I actually fixing the problem?

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:16.020
Hi there everyone, Julian here for DNews from
YouTube Space LA.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.369
We’ve all done it.

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.760
Don’t act like you haven’t.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.329
The the remote doesn’t work, the fridge
makes a weird noise, the jukebox won’t play,

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:23.689
so you give it a quick smack.

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.069
And then, almost magically, everything is
fixed.

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:27.579
For about 30 minutes.

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:28.680
What’s happening here?

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.110
Well you’re probably not actually a wizard
with dominion over appliances, but because

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.490
you can’t see what happened inside it certainly
feels that way.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.090
More than likely there’s a loose wire or
bad solder, and by giving it a good thump

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.550
you’ve knocked it back into place and the
machine is functioning like it was designed

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:43.670
to again.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.950
But odds are good the problem will come back
again.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.660
Taking something apart to clean it and check
all the connections may not be as fast or

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.310
satisfying as giving it a good smack, but
it’s certainly more permanent.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.310
If you need to fix something and just can’t
take it apart because you’re, say, on a

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.310
nuclear submarine, there are a couple handy
euphemisms you can use when filling out the

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.310
navy’s paperwork.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:55.310
Percussive maintenance, impact calibration,
or mechanical agitation are good ones, but

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.310
my favorite is “The Clarkson Method.”

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:57.310
However, just as Jeremy Clarkson learned,
you can’t fix all your problems by hitting

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:58.310
them.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:59.310
There’s a good chance you’ll make the
problem worse.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.310
So what about other techniques?

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.310
Like blowing on something, specifically video
game cartridges.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.310
I grew up with an NES and when it started
acting up, I vividly remember pulling out

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.030
the cartridge, blowing on the 72 copper pins,
and inserting it again, and it worked like

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.030
a charm.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.759
Or at least it felt that way, but actually
what I was doing was making the problem worse.

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:12.880
Copper tarnishes when it’s exposed to oxygen,
something you’re familiar with if you’ve

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.640
ever heard of the statue of liberty.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.539
Moisture from your breath with oxygen dissolved
in it can prolong the O2’s contact with

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:22.890
the pins, tarnishing them faster and making
it harder for the system to read the cartridge.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.359
If you really want to clean the pins, it’s
recommended you use isopropyl alcohol on a

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:28.620
cotton swab to dissolve and soak up any grease.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.770
If the pins are oxidized, a pencil eraser
can rub off the patina and the underlying

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.539
copper should be shiny and conductive.

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:37.570
So why did we all keep blowing into our copies
of Duck Hunt?

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.840
Well just the act of reseating the cartridge
probably fixed the problem, but we attributed

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.899
it to our sweet blowing skills because, well,
kids are kind of dumb sometimes.

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.569
Alright so you can break your precious delicate
electronics by hitting them or even just blowing

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:51.569
on them.

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:55.119
But surely turning them on and off again doesn’t
actually do anything, does it?

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:56.119
Yep, it does.

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:57.420
It’s a great equalizer.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.959
If your computer is running slow, it could
be a program is hoarding memory after running

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:01.959
for a long time.

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:05.759
Closing the program or rebooting the system
entirely will free up that memory for other

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:06.759
processes.

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.350
Modern software is extremely complex, and
the more complex something is the more opportunities

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.040
it has to go wrong.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.580
Sometimes there’s a low level software error
and the program can’t go on without restarting

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.580
from zero.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.830
It might not even be the software’s fault,
just a random event like a power glitch that

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.990
turns what should be a zero into a one.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.920
A simple reboot and it’s back in action.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.640
It works often but it won’t fix corrupted
software or failing hardware, but it’s a

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.730
quick and easy step to take before pulling
your whole computer apart.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.310
That’s why usually the IT guy’s first
question will be, “have you tried turning

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.890
it off and turning it on again?”

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.560
So shutting down your router might fix your
wifi so you can access the series of tubes

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.450
beyond it called the internet.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.320
Trace explains exactly how the internet works
down here.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.930
Are there any other quirky mysteries you want
explained?

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.500
let us know in the comments and I’ll see
you next time on DNews.
