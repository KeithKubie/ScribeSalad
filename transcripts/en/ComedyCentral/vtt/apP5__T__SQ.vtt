I'M LARRY WILMORE, AND AS YOU
KNOW, TODAY IS ST. PATRICK'S

00:00:04.103 --> 00:00:08.541 line:91%
DAY, THE DAY AMERICA CELEBRATE
ITS IRISH HERITAGE BY ENGAGING

00:00:08.574 --> 00:00:11.978 align:start position:0% line:91%
IN EVERY IRISH STEREOTYPE
IMAGINABLE.

00:00:12.011 --> 00:00:16.482 align:start position:0% line:91%
SERIOUSLY, IF WE OBSERVED OTHER
ETHNIC HOLIDAYS THE WAY WE

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:23.356 line:91%
OBSERVED TODAY, COLUMBUS TODAY
WOULD BE ABOUT MAKING A NICE

00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:25.024 align:start position:0% line:85%
SUNDAY SAUCE.

00:00:25.057 --> 00:00:26.726 size:88% position:44% line:85%
WE'D CELEBRATE KWANZAA LATE.

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:29.295 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:00:29.328 --> 00:00:32.165 align:start position:0% line:91%
ITALIANS MAKE SAUCE, BLACK
PEOPLE SHOW UP LATE.

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:33.499 size:81% position:41% line:85%
IT'S JUST SCIENCE, PEOPLE.

00:00:33.532 --> 00:00:37.770 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT THINK ABOUT IT, ALL DAY
TODAY WE DRINK, WE FIGHT IN THE

00:00:37.803 --> 00:00:38.137 align:start position:0% line:85%
STREETS.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.671 align:start position:0% line:85%
WE DRINK.

00:00:38.704 --> 00:00:41.240 align:start position:0% line:85%
WE PEE IN THE STREETS.

00:00:41.273 --> 00:00:42.008 align:start position:0% line:85%
WE DRINK.

00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:43.309 align:start position:0% line:85%
WE PUKE IN THE STREETS.

00:00:43.342 --> 00:00:49.015 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND THEN WHEN WE'RE DONE, WE DO
A LITTLE BIT OF THIS.

00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:54.520 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; OH!

00:00:54.553 --> 00:00:57.423 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OH, MY GOD.

00:00:57.456 --> 00:01:03.629 line:91%
SO THAT'S WHY YOU WEAR GREEN SO
YOUR BARF MATCHES YOUR SHIRT.

00:01:03.662 --> 00:01:05.698 size:88% position:44% line:85%
IT'S ALL ABOUT COORDINATING.

00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:09.635 align:start position:0% line:91%
THERE IS SO MUCH DRUNK DUDE
D.N.A. ON THE SIDEWALK AFTER ST.

00:01:09.668 --> 00:01:15.408 align:start position:0% line:91%
PATRICK'S DAY, SCIENTISTS COULD
COMBINE IT TO MAKE A 

00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:16.542 align:start position:0% line:85%
FRAT BRO SUPER VILLAIN.

00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:18.978 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY COULD USE THE TIMES SQUARE
BALL TO PLAY BEER PONG.

00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:21.180 line:85%
TURN GLACIERS INTO ICE LUGES.

00:01:21.213 --> 00:01:22.982 align:start position:0% line:85%
IT WOULD BE A DISASTER.

00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:29.155 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT NOW, IS DRUNK AND DISORDERLY
THE WAY WE CELEBRATE EVERY

00:01:29.188 --> 00:01:29.822 align:start position:0% line:85%
HOLIDAY NOW?

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:31.157 line:85%
WE DRINK ON ST. PATRICK'S DAY.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.459 size:81% position:41% line:85%
WE DRINK ON CINCO DE MAYO.

00:01:33.492 --> 00:01:34.694 align:start size:94% position:6% line:91%
PERSONALLY, I DRINK ON ARBOR
DAY.

00:01:34.727 --> 00:01:37.964 align:start position:0% line:91%
I JUST GET A KEG AND SIT IN THE
FOREST.

00:01:37.997 --> 00:01:39.265 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )

00:01:39.298 --> 00:01:41.100 align:start position:0% line:85%
TRUE.

00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:42.535 align:start position:0% line:85%
I DON'T KNOW.

00:01:42.568 --> 00:01:44.270 size:84% position:42% line:85%
THE TREES JUST GET ME, MAN.

00:01:44.303 --> 00:01:47.140 size:75% position:38% line:85%
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:49.675 align:start position:0% line:91%
PERSONALLY, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT
THAT CRAZY ABOUT PARADES.

00:01:49.708 --> 00:01:51.444 line:85%
LOOK, MY PEOPLE LOVE TO MARCH.

00:01:51.477 --> 00:01:53.312 align:start position:0% line:85%
DON'T GET ME WRONG.

00:01:53.345 --> 00:01:56.849 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
WE DO, I KNOW.

00:01:56.882 --> 00:02:00.720 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT SO MUCH OF OUR ( BLEEP ) IS
SO SERIOUS.

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:06.159 line:91%
NOBODY WANTS TO RIDE ON THE
"HANDS UP DON'T SHOOT" FLOAT.

00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:07.060 align:start position:0% line:85%
SERIOUSLY.

00:02:07.093 --> 00:02:08.694 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
IT'S JUST NOT THAT FUN IS ALL

00:02:08.727 --> 00:02:10.530 align:start position:0% line:85%
I'M SAYING.

00:02:10.563 --> 00:02:13.099 line:91%
YOU KNOW, I'LL BE HONEST WITH
YOU, I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU,

00:02:13.132 --> 00:02:16.869 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT SELMA 50th MARCH COULD
HAVE USED SOME 40s.

00:02:16.902 --> 00:02:18.104 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

00:02:18.137 --> 00:02:19.705 size:78% position:39% line:85%
SPICE IT UP A LITTLE BIT.

00:02:19.738 --> 00:02:22.708 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO PARADES AREN'T FOR EVERYBODY,
BUT WHY ARE THERE SO MANY OF

00:02:22.741 --> 00:02:23.809 align:start position:0% line:85%
THEM IN NEW YORK CITY?

00:02:23.842 --> 00:02:26.712 align:start position:0% line:91%
I DON'T GET THAT. IF SOMEBODY
FROM CALIFORNIA--

00:02:26.745 --> 00:02:30.216 align:start size:91% position:9% line:91%
LOOK, YOU HAVE THE
ST. PATRICK'S DAY PARADE.

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:32.852 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE MACY'S DAY PARADE.

00:02:32.885 --> 00:02:36.255 align:start position:0% line:91%
GAY PRIDE PARADE, DOMINICAN DAY
PARADE.

00:02:36.288 --> 00:02:38.491 align:start position:0% line:85%
HOLD ON A SECOND.

00:02:38.524 --> 00:02:41.427 line:91%
HERE'S MY PROBLEMS WITH THOSE
THREE PARADES-- PUERTO RICO AND

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.163 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC ARE BOTH
IN THE CARIBBEAN.

00:02:44.196 --> 00:02:46.566 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT'S A PARADE DOUBLE DIP,
PEOPLE.

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:47.700 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
IT IS.

00:02:47.734 --> 00:02:51.537 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S LIKE HAVING A MACY'S PARADE
AND A MACY'S HUSKY BOYS

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.105 size:78% position:39% line:85%
DEPARTMENT PARADE, RIGHT?

00:02:53.138 --> 00:02:56.108 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
I'LL LET YOU DECIDE WHO IS THE

00:02:56.141 --> 00:02:59.045 size:84% position:42% line:85%
HUSKY BOY IN THAT SCENARIO.

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:04.483 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
BUT AS PARADES GO, NEW YORK'S

00:03:04.516 --> 00:03:08.588 align:start position:0% line:91%
ST. PADDY'S DAY'S CELEBRATION IS
THE IRISH MOTHER OF THEM ALL.

00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:12.725 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S A FIVE-HOUR EXTRAVAGANZA
DOWN 5TH AVENUE.

00:03:12.758 --> 00:03:14.527 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S FUN FOR EVERYONE. OH
RIGHT, NOT EVERYONE.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.331 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
&gt;&gt; ORGANIZERS FOR THE NEW
YORK ANNUAL ST. PATRICK'S DAY 

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:19.532 align:start position:0% line:91%
PARADE HAVE BANNED L.G.B.T.
GROUPS FROM MARCHING.

00:03:19.565 --> 00:03:21.634 size:81% position:41% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: ARE YOU SERIOUS?

00:03:21.667 --> 00:03:23.703 line:85%
IS THIS-- IS THIS STILL A THING?

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:27.473 line:91%
I MEAN, PEOPLE, THIS IS A PARADE
WHOSE MASCOT IS AN EFFETE LITTLE

00:03:27.506 --> 00:03:33.179 line:91%
MAN IN A GREEN VELVET SUIT AND
SPARKLY SHOES WHO SLIDES DOWN

00:03:33.212 --> 00:03:34.647 line:85%
RAINBOWS WHILE PLAYING A HARP.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.383 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
I MEAN, IF YOU'RE TRYING TO HAVE

00:03:37.416 --> 00:03:40.653 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOUR PARADE LOOK BUTCH, THAT GAY
CRUISE HAS SAILED, ALL RIGHT.

00:03:40.686 --> 00:03:42.655 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHY WOULD THEY NOT WANT TO HAVE
THEM?

00:03:42.688 --> 00:03:47.093 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; PARADE ORGANIZERS HAVE LONG
REFUSED ENTRY TO GAY GROUPS

00:03:47.126 --> 00:03:48.561 align:start position:0% line:85%
BASED ON RELIGION.

00:03:48.594 --> 00:03:49.428 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; OH!

00:03:49.461 --> 00:03:53.232 align:start position:0% line:91%
I THOUGHT IT WAS BASED ON
HOMOPHOBIA.

00:03:53.265 --> 00:03:55.534 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
DIDN'T KNOW.

00:03:55.567 --> 00:03:57.870 align:start position:0% line:85%
TOOK A WILD GUESS

00:03:57.903 --> 00:03:59.071 align:start position:0% line:85%
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

00:03:59.104 --> 00:04:02.742 line:91%
I THOUGHT GAYS WERE ALLOWED TO
MARCH IN THE ST. PATRICK'S DAY

00:04:02.775 --> 00:04:04.477 line:85%
PARADE BACK IN THE EARLY 90s.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.078 align:start position:0% line:85%
DIDN'T THAT GO WELL?

00:04:06.111 --> 00:04:07.413 size:84% position:42% line:85%
&gt;&gt; WE'RE HERE! WE'RE QUEER!

00:04:07.446 --> 00:04:14.487 align:start position:0% line:91%
GET USED TO IT!
&gt;&gt; AIDS!

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:22.528 align:start position:0% line:91%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; Larry: OH, MY GOD.

00:04:22.561 --> 00:04:24.563 align:start position:0% line:85%
BOO AIDS?

00:04:24.596 --> 00:04:27.733 align:start position:0% line:91%
WELL, WHO WOULD NOT WANT TO BOO
AIDS, I GUESS.

00:04:27.766 --> 00:04:30.269 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
EVEN AIDS WOULD BOO AIDS.

00:04:30.302 --> 00:04:31.504 align:start position:0% line:85%
LET'S BE HONEST.

00:04:31.537 --> 00:04:35.074 align:start position:0% line:91%
I TECHNICALLY AGREE WITH YOUR
WORDS, LADY.

00:04:35.107 --> 00:04:36.909 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOT SURE I AGREE WITH YOUR
SPIRIT.

00:04:36.942 --> 00:04:40.246 line:91%
BUT SOME 24 YEARS LATER, AND
LIKELY AFTER THAT LADY'S DEATH,

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:41.480 align:start position:0% line:85%
PROGRESS.

00:04:41.514 --> 00:04:44.517 line:91%
&gt;&gt; FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, TWO
GAY AND LESBIAN GROUPS MARCHED

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.986 align:start position:0% line:91%
IN SOUTHIE'S ST. PATRICK'S DAY
PARADE.

00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:48.087 size:88% position:44% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WOW, SOUTH BOSTON.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.389 align:start position:0% line:91%
MAN, THEY USED TO BE WICKED
PREDJUDICE.

00:04:50.422 --> 00:04:56.929 line:91%
I MEAN, THAT'S A PLACE WHERE IF
YOU DON'T GREET YOUR MA WITH A

00:04:56.962 --> 00:05:00.132 line:91%
HEAD BUTT, YOU'RE SUSPECTED OF
BEING A QUEER. GOOD JOB BOSTON

00:05:00.165 --> 00:05:03.669 align:start position:0% line:91%
NEW YORK FINALLY FEELING SHAME
FOR BEING BEHIND BOSTON HAS

00:05:03.702 --> 00:05:05.771 align:start position:0% line:91%
DECIDED TO LET ONE KIND OF GAY
GROUP IN.

00:05:05.804 --> 00:05:09.975 line:91%
&gt;&gt; OUT AT NBC UNIVERSAL WILL BE
THE FIRST AND ONLY GAY GROUP TO

00:05:10.008 --> 00:05:12.278 align:start position:0% line:91%
MARCH UNDER ITS OWN BANNER IN
THE PARADE.

00:05:12.311 --> 00:05:14.213 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OUT AT NBC
UNIVERSAL.

00:05:14.246 --> 00:05:16.916 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT SOUNDS LIKE AN ATTRACTION
AT THEIR THEME PARK, RIGHT?

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:21.387 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHAT DOES IT DO, SIMULATE ALL
THE THRILLS AND CHILLS OF COMING

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.724 align:start position:0% line:85%
OUT TO YOUR PARENTS?

00:05:24.757 --> 00:05:25.158 align:start position:0% line:85%
AAAH!

00:05:25.191 --> 00:05:25.658 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT WAS SCARY.

00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:27.560 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT WAS SO REAL.

00:05:27.593 --> 00:05:31.263 line:91%
SO WHY IS THIS NBC GAY GROUP THE
ONLY ONE ALLOWED IN THE PARADE?

00:05:31.296 --> 00:05:34.200 line:91%
&gt;&gt; NBC UNIVERSAL IS THE PARENT
COMPANY OF NBC NEW YORK, WHICH

00:05:34.233 --> 00:05:35.835 align:start position:0% line:85%
AIRS THE PARADE.

00:05:35.868 --> 00:05:39.205 align:start position:0% line:91%
L.G.B.T. GROUPS CALL THE
INCLUSION OF ONE GROUP A PLOY BY

00:05:39.238 --> 00:05:41.607 align:start position:0% line:91%
PARADE ORGANIZERS TO HOLD ON TO
SPONSORS.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.310 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: SO NBC IS THE ONE
AIRING THE PARADE AND THE ONLY

00:05:44.343 --> 00:05:47.413 align:start position:0% line:91%
GAY GROUP ALLOWED ON THE PARADE
WORKS AT NBC?

00:05:47.446 --> 00:05:52.585 align:start position:0% line:91%
THIS SEEMS LIKE A "SCRATCH MY
BACK I'LL GIVE YOU A

00:05:52.618 --> 00:05:53.753 size:84% position:42% line:85%
REACH-AROUND" KIND OF DEAL.

00:05:53.786 --> 00:05:56.455 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT IRISH CATHOLICS OF NEW YORK
ARE DUG IN ON THIS ISSUE.

00:05:56.488 --> 00:05:59.392 line:91%
HONESTLY, GAYS, NO OFFENSE, BUT
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO BE IN THIS

00:05:59.425 --> 00:06:00.526 align:start position:0% line:85%
THING?

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.461 align:start position:0% line:91%
I MEAN, PEOPLE ARE DRINKING TOO
MUCH TO EVEN NOTICE YOU

00:06:02.494 --> 00:06:07.533 line:91%
MARCHING, AND THE MUSIC SOUNDS
LIKE TWO GOATS DOING THE DEVIL'S

00:06:07.566 --> 00:06:08.467 align:start position:0% line:85%
BUSINESS.

00:06:08.501 --> 00:06:09.301 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
ON THE OTHER HAND, THE GAY PRIDE

00:06:09.335 --> 00:06:13.873 align:start position:0% line:91%
PARADE IS A GLITTER BOMB OF
INCLUSION.

00:06:13.906 --> 00:06:15.107 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
JOINING ME TO TALK MORE ABOUT

00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:18.978 line:91%
IS OUR NEW CONTRIBUTOR TO "THE
NIGHTLY SHOW," DAVID SMITHYMAN.

00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:19.845 align:start position:0% line:85%
WELCOME, DAVID.

00:06:19.878 --> 00:06:24.049 align:start position:0% line:91%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

00:06:24.082 --> 00:06:25.785 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY, NOW.

00:06:25.818 --> 00:06:28.220 align:start position:0% line:85%
NOW, DAVID, YOU'RE GAY.

00:06:28.253 --> 00:06:29.354 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I AM.

00:06:29.388 --> 00:06:32.925 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OH, AND IT ALSO
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE AUSTRALIAN.

00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.960 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE A KEEN OBSERVER,
LARRY.

00:06:34.993 --> 00:06:35.994 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OKAY.

00:06:36.028 --> 00:06:39.298 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO YOU WENT OUT TO THE ST.
PATRICK'S DAY'S PARADE.

00:06:39.331 --> 00:06:45.671 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I DID, AND I ALSO SAT DOWN
WITH ANDY HUMM, IRISH

ALMOST AS BORING AS IT IS NOW,

PROTEST THE PARADE, AND EVERYONE
KNOWS THAT THE KEY TO A GOOD

LOVELY SWEATERS.
