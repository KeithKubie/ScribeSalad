00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:12.049
Youâ€™re a historic class two thousand nine because
you have been seniors in this historic year

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:13.259
Singing: Ain't gunna let nobody

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.379
turn me around

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.929
No, turn me around

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:21.740
Ain't gunna let nobody

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.359
I'm gunna keep on

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.730
and talking 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.509
all the way up to freedom land

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:35.040
One that began with the power outage
in the Yard

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.800
and soon became momentous beyond imagining

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.340
The year the world became something very
different

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.580
from anything we ever expected 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.860
If we look back on the year

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.600
when the world shifted

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.290
we can remember

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.910
how we gathered in tercentenary theatre on that freezing day in October

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.810
to declare our commitment

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:08.230
to fight global warming. "We can with American
leadership galvanize a global commitment to

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.150
solve the climate crisis, we must do it
with this generation, we have everything we

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.719
need

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:20.719
with the possible exception of political will
but political will is a renewable resource."

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.140
how so many if you became involved in the
presidential campaigns

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.479
debated their merits and poured into the
streets

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.400
until past midnight after the election.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.970
"Yes we can!"

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.500
and so many of you have volunteered for every
kind of public service

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.400
from teaching civics in the Cambridge schools

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.930
to rebuilding churches Georgia during spring
break

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.930
to combating AIDS in rural Africa

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.990
and while we would never have wished

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.930
for some of the events of this year

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:11.930
at least some of you find silver linings in
its clouds

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.570
uncertainty demands new things from us

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.639
not just going through the motions in default mode.

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:24.469
but improvising

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:31.469
our way to new solutions

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:34.009
improvisation

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:38.029
which comes from the Latin 'not foreseen'

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:45.029
is what a liberal arts education has prepared
you to do

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:46.550
and what are the arts

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.339
but rigorously prepared for

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:57.339
improvisation.

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:11.239
and you also know by now that improvisation
is collaborative.

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:18.239
it requires actors who are confident in the
best sense

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:24.139
the world needs good and improvisers

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:27.060
President Obama has called this moment in
our history

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.609
a season of renewal

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.700
and reinvention

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.699
it's also an affirmation of just

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:37.769
how much education matters

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:44.769
of how much you as educated citizens matter

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.730
remember that

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.289
improvising in face a change

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:59.069
is exactly what your liberal arts education

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.349
as prepared you to do

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:07.689
the opportunity to renew our commitments and
remap our lives

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:10.209
is a privilege given only

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.359
to some generations

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:14.919
Trumpet plays America the Beautiful

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.330
By virtue

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.319
of authority

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:34.349
delegated to me,

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:34.870
and recognizing

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:41.379
your high academic achievements

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:50.249
I confer on you

00:05:00.929 --> 00:05:02.689
the first degree

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:03.230
in arts

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.130
or in science

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.240
and I admit you to

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.389
the fellowship

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:14.389
of educated men and women.
