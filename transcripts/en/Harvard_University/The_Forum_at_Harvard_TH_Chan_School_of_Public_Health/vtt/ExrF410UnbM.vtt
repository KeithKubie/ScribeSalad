MICHELLE WILLIAMS:
Welcome to The Forum,

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.700
live-streamed worldwide
from the Leadership Studio

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.760
at the Harvard T.H. Chan
School of Public Health.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.980
I'm Dean Michelle Williams.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.340
The Forum is a collaboration
between the Harvard Chan School

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.590
and independent news media.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.560
Each program features
a panel of experts

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.430
addressing some of today's most
pressing public health issues.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.950
The Forum is one way
the school advances

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.710
the frontiers of public
health, and makes

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.630
scientific insights accessible
to policymakers and the public.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.270
I hope you find this program
engaging and informative.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.460
Thank you for joining us.

00:01:00.188 --> 00:01:01.610
CAROLINE HUMER: Welcome.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:02.900
My name is Caroline Humer.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.510
I'm a correspondent,
I work for Reuters.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.580
And I'm your moderator today.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.370
We're here today to
discuss US drug prices.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.380
Why are they so high?

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.280
The US spends the most per
capita on prescription drugs

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.250
compared to other high income
countries, according to a 2017,

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.430
Commonwealth Fund report.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.180
Companies that astronomically
hike prices on some drugs,

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.340
such as the infamous
5,000 percent

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.660
increase on the antibiotic
Daraprim in 2015,

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.890
grab headlines.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.980
And some Americans
are still struggling

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.980
to cope with their
medical expenses.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.690
Sometimes they skip their
prescriptions altogether,

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.610
or they ration it and take less
than the recommended dosage.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.720
Yet US prescription
drug spending

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.580
as a share of total
national health expenditures

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.480
is in keeping with
other countries.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.340
So what's going on and why does
it matter for public health?

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.710
To help us unpack the
complicated picture,

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.894
we've brought together
an esteemed panel.

00:02:02.894 --> 00:02:05.310
And starting from my immediate
right, I'll introduce them.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.160
We have Aaron Kesselheim.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.949
He's associate professor of
medicine, Harvard Medical

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.200
School, Brigham and
Women's Hospital,

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.890
and director of the program
on Regulation, Therapeutics,

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.240
and Law.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.160
To his right is Richard Frank.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.290
He's professor of
Health Economics

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.170
in the Department of Health
Care Policy at Harvard Medical

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.370
School.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.190
Next to him is Steven
Pearson, president

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.880
of the Institute for
Clinical and Economic Review.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.620
And at the end is Leemore Dafny.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.190
She's a professor of Business
Administration at the Harvard

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.840
Business School.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.500
Today's event is being
presented jointly with Reuters.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.620
And it is part of the Dr.
Lawrence H and Roberta Cohn

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:46.700
forums.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.680
We're pleased to welcome
the Cohn family today.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.300
Thank you.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.410
We're streaming on the
websites live now on The Forum

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.820
and on Reuters.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.660
We're also streaming on
Facebook and on Reuters TV.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.390
The program will
include a brief Q&amp;A.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.651
And so you could email questions
to The Forum at Harvard--

00:03:07.651 --> 00:03:08.150
no.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.200
The Forum@hsph.harvard.edu.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.810
And you can participate in
a live chat that's happening

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.780
right now on The Forum website.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:24.950
So prescription drug costs have
entered the political arena.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.280
In May, President Trump
unveiled a blueprint

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.470
meant to address
lowering drug prices.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.600
Let's take a look
at the announcement.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.110
DONALD TRUMP: Today,
my administration

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.310
is launching the most
sweeping action in history

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.190
to lower the price
of prescription drugs

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.650
for the American people.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.200
We've wanted to be
doing this, we've

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.330
been working on it
right from day one.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.230
It's been a complicated process
but not too complicated.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.440
And today, it's happening.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.640
We will have tougher
negotiation, more competition,

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.990
and much lower prices
at the pharmacy counter.

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.710
And it'll start to
take effect very soon.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.830
My administration has already
taken significant steps

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.530
to get drug prices
under control.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.070
We reformed the drug discount
program for safety net

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.950
hospitals to save
senior citizens

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:29.000
hundreds of millions of dollars
on drugs this year alone.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.850
We're also increasing
competition and reducing

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:37.340
regulatory burdens, so drugs can
be gotten to the market quicker

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.930
and cheaper.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.260
We're very much
eliminating the middle man,

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.260
the middle man became
very, very rich.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.760
Right?

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.070
Whoever those middle men were,
and a lot of people never

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.810
even figured it
out, they're rich.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.260
CAROLINE HUMER: Well,
despite this announcement,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.750
A Politico Harvard
Chan poll this summer

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.690
showed that just
over 27% of adults

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.050
had heard or read
about the blueprint.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.110
And among those who were
aware, about four in 10

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.360
think that it will lower prices.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.860
And in 2018, recent reporting
shows that drug prices

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.760
are still rising.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.790
So as we will
hear, the blueprint

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.970
is not the only plan in town.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.760
Democratic proposals
call for giving Medicare

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.440
the power to directly negotiate
with drug manufacturers.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.410
That would open the door
to cheaper Canadian imports

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:37.560
as well.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.490
And they want to impose
fines on drug makers

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.050
for the kinds of dramatic price
hikes that have made headlines.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.990
So let's get into it a little
bit and start with Aaron.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.240
Can you describe the
prescription price

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.342
setting landscape in the US?

00:05:52.342 --> 00:05:53.300
AARON KESSELHEIM: Sure.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.680
So first of all, it's a
pleasure to be on this panel.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.230
And thanks for inviting
me to be a part of this.

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.790
So prescription drug
costs in the United States

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.370
make up about a
$450 billion market

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.317
and take up about 20% or
so of health care dollars.

00:06:07.317 --> 00:06:08.900
And some private
payers are indicating

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.150
that they now account
for about a quarter

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.470
of all their spending.

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.420
And prescription drug
spending in general

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.510
is driven by brand name
drug prices, which make up--

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.750
brand name drugs make up
about 10% of prescriptions,

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:27.740
but 72%, 75% of prescription
drug spending overall.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.540
And the sort of
fundamental reason

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.290
why brand name prescription
drugs are so costly

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.990
is that the drugs are priced at
whatever the market will bear.

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.420
That's the sort of general
fundamental principle for drug

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.040
pricing in the United States.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.550
And in fact, the market
bears a substantial amount.

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.440
And that's because it's a very
inefficient and ineffective

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:46.940
market.

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.340
And I just want to sort of
focus on a couple of reasons

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:50.390
why that is.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.440
So first of all,
there is a disconnect,

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.820
a fundamental disconnect
between the physicians

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.640
that are prescribing the drug
and the patients that are then

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.470
taking and paying for the drug.

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.580
And oftentimes, physicians
don't know what drugs costs.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.400
And then many patients have
prescription drug insurance

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.330
to cover the costs
of their products.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.390
So they only are exposed
to a small amount

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:12.860
of the cost of the product.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.540
And many patients
then also therefore

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:18.764
don't know necessarily what
the full costs of a drug is.

00:07:18.764 --> 00:07:20.180
And then, of course,
when you talk

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.370
about the insurance
and the payer market

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.940
for prescription drugs, there
is a range of different payers

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.070
that we use in the United
States to pay for drugs.

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:31.860
There are government payers
like Medicare and Medicaid.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.520
And we have various
laws in place

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.010
that restrict the ability
of those kinds of payers

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:40.370
to negotiate with
pharmaceutical manufacturers.

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:44.400
And then there are, of course,
private payers as well.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.730
And they try to
negotiate individually

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.730
through systems of complex
confidential rebates

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:54.110
and other mechanisms, and
that is not necessarily

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:55.410
a very effective mechanism.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:59.690
And so, you know,
fundamentally what we have--

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:02.620
brand name prescription drugs
are protected by patents,

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:07.400
they're monopoly markets, and
we don't have an effective way

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:11.360
of negotiating on the
other side of that in order

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.969
to provide a counterweight.

00:08:12.969 --> 00:08:15.260
And so I think what we'll
talk about a little bit today

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.885
are some of the mechanisms that
we could use to better do that.

00:08:17.885 --> 00:08:20.420
But the sort of
minor changes that

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.670
are mentioned and by
Trump and the blueprint

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:26.660
are not necessarily going to
get at that fundamental issue

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:27.334
until we--

00:08:27.334 --> 00:08:29.750
And we're going to need to
take some much more substantial

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:33.710
steps because the outcome
of all of this inefficiency

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:36.409
and these high prices
is that patients

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:38.510
have trouble affording
the essential medications

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:39.630
that they need.

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:43.414
And so price-related
medication non-adherence,

00:08:43.414 --> 00:08:45.830
when patients don't take the
essential medications they're

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:49.160
prescribed, is way too
prevalent in the United States.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.950
It leads to worse
patient outcomes.

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:54.500
People with diabetes are
unable to afford the insulin

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.910
that they need.

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:59.240
Patients with cancer are
unable to afford the cancer

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.340
drugs that they need,
and that will help them.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:04.730
And so, you know,
I think that that

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:07.070
presents sort of an
ethical imperative

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:08.665
to try to take
care of this issue.

00:09:08.665 --> 00:09:09.915
CAROLINE HUMER: Thanks, Aaron.

00:09:09.915 --> 00:09:12.470
It does sound complicated.

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:15.650
Richard, you have talked
about diagnosing the problem

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:17.470
of high drug prices.

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:21.094
What's your assessment
of what's going on?

00:09:21.094 --> 00:09:25.100
RICHARD FRANK: Well, like
Aaron, competition actually

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:30.440
does a pretty good job
at harnessing the prices

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.060
when it's there.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:36.590
And the question is, why
isn't it there more often?

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:40.760
You know, the place
that it doesn't do well

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:44.660
is when people are
almost completely

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.200
covered by their insurance.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.960
They don't pay very
much out of pocket.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.330
And where there isn't
much competition,

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:57.060
either due to a patent
monopoly or due to some variety

00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:01.620
of other either regulatory
factors or market factors

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:04.480
that keep competitors
off the market.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.930
And so when you have
people that are fully

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:10.050
insured facing a
monopoly where they

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:14.430
don't have a choice, an
alternative essentially,

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:17.390
you have a recipe
for high prices

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:20.670
and rapidly growing prices.

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:23.190
The Medicare Part
D program, which

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:28.680
is the place where everybody
is focused on for negotiation,

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:34.250
is sort of a really
interesting example of this.

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:36.930
It essentially
consists of two pieces.

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:43.020
One piece is you have specialty
pharmaceutical insurance

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:45.970
companies competing
to cover people.

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:49.800
And they in turn negotiate
with prescription drug makers

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.450
for prices.

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:58.380
And if they pay more
for a drug, that

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:01.970
comes out of their pocket, that
comes out of their bottom line.

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:04.030
There's a second
part to Medicare Part

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:08.730
D, which is what people refer
to as the reinsurance part.

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:15.360
And there, patients pay
about 5% of the cost.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:18.720
These prescription drug plans,
these specialty insurers

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:22.830
pay about 15%, and the
government picks up 80%.

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:27.360
So are very little on the
hook for that extra cost

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.020
of the drug.

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:30.420
And therefore, in
those circumstances,

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.300
the incentive to fight
hard for good prices

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:36.780
is dramatically weakened.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:40.710
And so again, what you
see is very high prices

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:42.510
in that section of the benefit.

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:46.624
And in fact, the entire
growth of the program--

00:11:46.624 --> 00:11:47.790
well, not the entire growth.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:51.720
Almost the entire growth of
the program over the last,

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.940
say, eight or nine
years, has been

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.220
due to the growth
in that reinsurance

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:57.900
part of the program.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:02.200
Where, in fact, the competition
is most likely to break down.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.360
And it actually turns out to
be a relatively small number

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:11.220
of drugs that are
generating all the costs.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:15.480
In Medicare, 90% of the
prescriptions are for generics.

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.480
And generic drugs continue
to fall in price for the most

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:23.290
part, with some exceptions,
like the one you noted.

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:26.970
But there's about
probably 10, 20 drugs,

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:32.370
maybe 25 drugs that cost
more than $1,000 a month.

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:34.740
And that's where the
problem really is.

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:39.750
And so that has been the focus
of a lot of policy attention.

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:41.720
CAROLINE HUMER: Thank you.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:45.630
Steven, let's dig a little bit
deeper and talk a little bit

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:49.080
about, you know,
brand name drugs.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:52.300
How they're priced here, how
they're priced in Europe.

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.895
What's the difference
there and what's going on?

00:12:54.895 --> 00:12:55.770
STEVEN PEARSON: Sure.

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:57.270
There's a big difference.

00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:00.690
I mean, when a new drug is
approved by the FDA, not all

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:04.254
the time, but we often have
the chance to celebrate science

00:13:04.254 --> 00:13:05.670
and, you know, an
achievement that

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:07.426
will really benefit patients.

00:13:07.426 --> 00:13:09.300
And that does capture
a fair amount of media.

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:11.770
But what's interesting is
that every time that happens,

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:13.380
something else has occurred.

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:16.290
Either that day or in
and around that time.

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:20.310
And that's a kind of
uniquely-- in an economy,

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:23.250
a company gets to
name its price.

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:26.700
And that price is the
price that the government

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:30.210
will pay for what that
company has developed

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:32.910
without any direct negotiation.

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:36.510
Now, to be fair, the prices
are thought about for years

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:39.630
and then kind of a final phase
happens just before the launch.

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:41.130
And companies do
have to think about

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:42.782
the competitive landscape.

00:13:42.782 --> 00:13:45.240
So you know, if they want a
certain amount of market share,

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:48.480
just like any other
kind of marketplace,

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.880
they have to think about
how their price will compete

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.010
given its relative
advantages for patients

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:55.440
versus another drug.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.590
The reason that hasn't
led to a lot of control

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:00.870
on costs, certainly
compared to Europe,

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:04.710
is because drugs are not
easy to walk away from.

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:07.737
It's not like a cell phone or a
car where you can go next door

00:14:07.737 --> 00:14:08.820
and get a different brand.

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:10.780
And it's essentially
the same thing.

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:12.630
And you can make
your own trade-offs.

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:16.270
Drugs really do have slightly
different characteristics.

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:19.320
And so, we as patients
and we as physicians,

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.630
we as health
systems, want to make

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:24.570
a broad variety of the
developed drugs available.

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:28.090
So that tilts the kind of
the dynamics of the market,

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:30.960
if you will, on top of
having a patent system that

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.210
at launch will give
a company, again,

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:36.630
a certain number of years during
which it may have the landscape

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:38.530
entirely to itself.

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:42.330
So think of name your price
as a simple overly simplistic,

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.910
but that's kind of the
way it happens in the US.

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:47.340
The reason that they
don't charge $10 million

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.932
is because Congress would
probably get a whiff of that

00:14:49.932 --> 00:14:51.390
and want to have
a special hearing.

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:55.790
And you know, the whole system
might come crumbling down.

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:56.960
Europe does it differently.

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.870
And I'm using Europe very
obviously stereotypically.

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:02.700
But it's every other
developed country.

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:05.540
So you can start at the South
Pole and go to the North Pole.

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:07.310
Many middle and
developing countries

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:10.330
also have some system
of doing three things.

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:12.800
And like any good
slogan, it rhymes.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.500
They aggregate the buying power.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:19.190
They evaluate the clinical
and cost effectiveness.

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:21.110
And they negotiate.

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:25.400
So they aggregate,
evaluate, and negotiate.

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.497
Aggregation means that
they pool, basically

00:15:27.497 --> 00:15:29.330
either in a national
health insurance system

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:32.030
or by cobbling together the
existing private market in very

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:36.620
specific ways, to have basically
all the weight of having all

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:40.760
the patients or all the
members of a country

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.190
kind of have the weight of
that in the negotiations.

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:46.340
So that you can say,
well, if we pick your drug

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.920
or we do make your
drug more available,

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.290
it's going to get
a lot of uptake.

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:52.760
Whereas if we
don't, you're really

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.500
going to hurt in this country.

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:58.880
So that lends to a different
dynamic in negotiation.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.680
They evaluate the evidence.

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:05.210
Every other developed country
has a federal instituter agency

00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:07.520
that takes a close look at
the comparative clinical

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:11.330
effectiveness of drugs at
or near the time of launch

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:14.420
to help inform that
process of what comes

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.780
next, which is negotiation.

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.472
And negotiation looks
very differently

00:16:18.472 --> 00:16:19.430
in different countries.

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:21.500
It really does, they have
different structures.

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.600
But ultimately, the key
part about negotiation

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.420
is that these countries are
willing to stick with it.

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:30.080
They're willing, in
some cases, to say no.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.940
If the price
doesn't seem to mean

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:35.600
that it's a reasonable value
for them and it's affordable,

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.760
they're willing
to play hardball.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.740
And you can have some
very famous examples.

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.740
One going on right now is
around cystic fibrosis drugs

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:44.960
in many different
European countries.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:48.110
There is a real roadblock
going on between governments

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:50.100
and the manufacturer.

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:52.520
So they aggregate,
they evaluate,

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:55.640
and they negotiate, and
they mean the last phase

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.960
to have teeth.

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:59.840
And I think that's one of
the biggest differences

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:02.750
that I see in how drugs
are priced in the US

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:03.500
versus in Europe.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:04.859
CAROLINE HUMER: Thanks.

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:06.650
Leemore, Richard
spoke a little bit

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:10.849
before about how consumers
in the government programs

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:13.280
are protected by this structure.

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:16.579
You have also researched
the impact of rising drug

00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:18.829
costs on consumers,
and surprisingly

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:21.319
found that many consumers
in commercial plans,

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:24.470
ones offered by employers
or other institutions,

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:27.050
may not be feeling the
hit of these higher drug

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:29.557
prices in the way that
we think they are.

00:17:29.557 --> 00:17:30.890
Can you tell us more about that?

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:32.223
LEEMORE DAFNY: Sure, absolutely.

00:17:32.223 --> 00:17:35.190
First of all, thank you
for having me here today.

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:37.820
And I'm going to echo some of
the themes that have already

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:38.720
been mentioned.

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:43.130
But a very little known fact is
that they share that consumers

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:45.050
are spending for
their drugs today

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:48.180
is actually lower than
it was over 10 years ago.

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:50.390
And in fact, I looked up
the statistics this morning,

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:53.690
national health
expenditures, and discovered

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:56.390
that the absolute dollar
amount that we are spending out

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:58.400
of pocket for retail
prescription drugs

00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:59.530
has gone down.

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:00.170
OK?

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:04.520
So that is true in spite of the
fact that prices are going up.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.110
And I'm not just
talking list prices,

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:08.540
I'm saying spending
is in fact going up.

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:13.130
And I believe that this
protection of sheltering

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:15.890
consumers, just as
Richard mentioned,

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:19.070
sheltering consumers
from the actual cost

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:21.620
of these medications
is part of what is

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:25.190
driving the growth in prices.

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:28.550
And there are various mechanisms
that pharmaceutical companies

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:31.010
can employ to shelter consumers.

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:35.030
Including co-payment coupons
for the commercially insured,

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:39.110
patient assistance programs
for Medicare enrollees.

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:42.590
And those are mechanisms
that tamp down the demand

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:44.410
sensitivity to prices.

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:47.060
Now, that's not
the only component.

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:50.810
Another component
is then it disables

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:53.810
the ability of pharmaceutical
benefit managers

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:57.860
to try to negotiate for
better prices in exchange

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:00.770
for preferred tier placement
on their formularies.

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:03.890
Because if I'm not paying much
out of pocket because I have

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:05.990
a coupon I can use,
then I don't really

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:08.030
care if it's a tier 4 drug.

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:11.180
And therefore, that
manufacturer just

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:14.570
wants to make sure that
the drug is on a formulary,

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:17.040
but is sort of indifferent
to the pressure,

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:19.220
doesn't have pressure
to keep the price low.

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:21.800
And so I'm currently
trying to do some research

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.230
to try to quantify the
effect of these programs

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:27.800
in driving prices up, but
I believe it's significant.

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.570
There are two other
factors that I'm

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:32.870
hoping to mention in addition.

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:37.430
One was echoed previously, which
is there are some really high

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:41.180
priced drugs without strong
therapeutic substitutes that

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.700
are driving high spending.

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:47.450
And in the past, we've
benefited from generic entry

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:49.550
when we were talking
about chemical compounds

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:52.740
bringing down the
prices of drugs.

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:56.760
But now these drugs are
primarily biologic compounds.

00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:00.150
And we haven't
seen the same entry

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:01.890
of biosimilars in
the United States

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:05.700
or adoption of
biosimilars, let alone any

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:08.940
of the willingness to take
hard bargaining stances

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:12.040
as Steve Pearson has mentioned.

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:14.580
So that's, I think,
another key driver

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:16.500
of what we're seeing today.

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:19.160
And last, and hopefully
we'll be able to discuss it

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.965
in somewhat greater detail as
the panel continues, but there

00:20:22.965 --> 00:20:25.350
are a fair number
of strategies that

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:28.530
the pharmaceutical
manufacturers employ,

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:32.340
which FDA commissioner Scott
Gottlieb called shenanigans.

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:35.790
These are attempts to
shield their products

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:37.450
from competition.

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:40.860
And also to evergreen
their products

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:43.590
and create new formulations,
but at the same time

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:46.080
avoid competition from generics.

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.270
And all of these are
really important factors

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:51.840
in causing higher spending,
even if consumers are not

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:55.592
themselves shouldering
out of pocket a greater

00:20:55.592 --> 00:20:56.550
share of that spending.

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:58.140
CAROLINE HUMER: Thanks, Leemore.

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:00.360
We will get back to talking
about those shenanigans

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:01.950
for sure.

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:05.310
So we've heard a lot about
the drivers of drug prices.

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:08.010
And now we're going to
hear from a patient.

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:12.810
This is Pam Holt. And this video
comes from the US department

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:15.556
of Health and Human Services.

00:21:15.556 --> 00:21:19.570
PAMELA HOLT: My name is Pamela
Holt. I'm a retired teacher.

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:22.480
I have in this last
year had to pay over

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:27.290
$10,000 in medical costs for
my drug to keep me alive.

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:32.320
I was a newly retired principal
at an elementary school

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:34.580
and feeling pretty
good about retirement.

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:36.370
Just kind of out of
the blue was diagnosed

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:38.350
with multiple myeloma.

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:42.130
I had one drug specifically
that was very costly.

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:47.410
Without the drug I am on, my
survival rate is much less.

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:48.830
I need the drug.

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:53.170
I thought I had a comfortable
retirement being an educator

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:54.910
and having social security.

00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:58.960
But it turned out that
this drug was more than I

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.910
could handle on my income.

00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:04.540
It became very costly
for me to the point

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:09.300
where just recently I
had to refinance my home.

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:12.360
It's impacted my life seriously.

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.200
I have eight grandchildren.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.290
I really would like to
spoil them and take them

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:18.490
places and do things with them.

00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:20.240
I can't do that.

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:23.510
I would love to see
action done that

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:26.290
would help generics
to come on the market

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:29.050
because that would
help me personally.

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:33.910
And I feel strongly that
drug companies are just

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:38.136
gouging patients who are dying.

00:22:38.136 --> 00:22:40.790
VOICEOVER: American
patients first.

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:44.890
HHS.gov/drugpricing.

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:47.890
Produced by the US department
of Health and Human Services

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:50.706
at taxpayer expense.

00:22:50.706 --> 00:22:52.060
CAROLINE HUMER: OK.

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:55.150
Well, let's talk now
about ways that we

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:58.020
can address these drug prices.

00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:01.450
You know, what can be done,
what is already being done.

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:03.400
I think a good
place to start here

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:05.620
would be with that
Trump blueprint

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:07.750
that we referenced
at the beginning.

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:10.220
That was announced in July.

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:13.840
There's about six weeks
until the midterm elections.

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.540
And wondering if
anyone on our panel

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:19.780
might just address, you
know, whether or not

00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:23.680
anything has come from that
or if we should be expecting

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:26.940
anything from it in the
next six weeks that could,

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:28.960
you know, answer
some of these issues

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:33.397
for people like
Pam Holt. Anyone?

00:23:33.397 --> 00:23:34.980
AARON KESSELHEIM:
Well, so I'll start.

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:35.800
CAROLINE HUMER: Thanks, Aaron.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.341
AARON KESSELHEIM:
So I think, I mean,

00:23:37.341 --> 00:23:39.490
again, I think we
all support Pam Holt

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:42.730
and want to see her
do the same sorts of--

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:44.980
and want to have the
same kinds of goals

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:48.850
that she has in
trying to get drug

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:51.260
prices to a reasonable level.

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:56.140
The blueprint itself had, you
know, had a lot of ideas in it.

00:23:56.140 --> 00:24:00.550
It had a lot of ideas at a
very sort of high, vague level.

00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:06.400
There weren't a lot of specifics
about particular interventions.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.840
There were a lot
of questions that

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:10.131
were asked where it seemed
like the government was just

00:24:10.131 --> 00:24:11.980
trying to get information.

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:14.200
There were some
good ideas and then

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:17.350
there were some ideas that are
probably useless or bad ideas.

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:21.610
And so I don't necessarily
think that this

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:26.492
is a strategy or a
clear path forward

00:24:26.492 --> 00:24:27.950
for trying to
address these issues.

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:30.670
But I do want to point out one
of the positive issues that

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:33.610
was mentioned in the blueprint
and that was mentioned earlier

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:36.550
by Leemore is the idea
of getting competition

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:38.710
onto the market at
a reasonable time.

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:42.550
And the only kind
of competition that

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:45.490
substantially and consistently
lowers drug prices in the US

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:48.970
is competition from
interchangeable generic drugs.

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:53.360
And so when there
are very expensive,

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.750
you know, biologic
molecules where

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:58.960
you don't have that same kind
of interchangeable competition,

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:02.890
then you can get high prices
extended out indefinitely.

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:06.400
And so to the extent that
the blueprint talked about it

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.260
as an aspirational
goal to try to get

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:10.930
more interchangeable
competition on the market,

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:14.020
I think that was one of
the positive ideas that

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:15.160
was in that document.

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:16.120
CAROLINE HUMER: OK.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:19.750
And that competition,
it sounds, Leemore,

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:23.320
like you're talking about some
shenanigans that prevent that

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:24.070
from happening.

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:26.290
Maybe you could just
share that with us.

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:28.090
LEEMORE DAFNY: Before
I go to shenanigans,

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:32.800
though we love to talk about
them, with good reason,

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:36.280
I just want to piggyback on
something that Aaron just

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.800
mentioned, which
is the potential

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:42.160
to see more competition
in the biologic space.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:43.930
And what actions
the administration

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:46.270
could possibly take
to promote that.

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:48.580
And he touched on this
issue of interchangeability.

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:51.340
And that's really the engine
of success for generic drugs

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:54.010
because you get a prescription
from your physician,

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:55.510
you go to the
pharmacy, the pharmacy

00:25:55.510 --> 00:26:00.280
can automatically substituted
it for a generic compound

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:02.500
and for any manufacturer
of that compound.

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:08.440
The FDA has so far chosen to
reject calling biosimilars

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:13.120
by the same non-proprietary
name as the biologic reference

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:13.630
product.

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:17.430
And so that change in
the naming guidance

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:20.620
would help with this
interchangeability

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:22.210
that was referenced.

00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:25.300
And the FDA also
could release guidance

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:27.730
on what is going to
count as interchangeable

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:29.990
and ideally not make
it as onerous as they

00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:31.250
have suggested in the past.

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:35.740
So there are actions that could
be taken to foster greater

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:37.480
competition in that space.

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.240
There are also actions that
the manufacturers themselves,

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.820
the shenanigans that
we talked about,

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:46.420
employ in order to
maximize profits.

00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:49.630
And one of those that has gotten
a lot of attention of late

00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:55.900
is choosing to withhold samples
of their products from, I

00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:59.410
should say, manufacturers
seeking to copy them.

00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:02.470
And you can understand
competitively

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:04.480
why they would want to do that.

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:08.050
But the rationale is that
these manufacturers don't

00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:12.460
have a proper prescription
for having this medication

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:15.220
and it might fall
into the wrong hands.

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:16.660
And then the
manufacturer might be

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:19.810
responsible for anybody
who's mishandled or misused

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:20.440
the drugs.

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.330
And there have been
many, many statements

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:26.620
by public officials saying
that the law was specifically

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:31.390
designed to enable
manufacturers to try

00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:32.800
to copy these medications.

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:36.340
And the pharmaceutical
industry continues

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:39.940
to resist legislation
that would explicitly

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:44.830
require the samples to be
provided at market prices.

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:46.330
CAROLINE HUMER:
Just to skip back

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:48.130
for a second to that
interchangeability,

00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:50.590
is there any indication
that the FDA,

00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:52.660
that the commissioner,
Scott Gottlieb,

00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:56.050
is leaning towards the
idea of interchangeability

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:59.389
in the new policies
coming this fall?

00:27:59.389 --> 00:28:00.930
LEEMORE DAFNY: You
want to take that?

00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:02.015
RICHARD FRANK: Do you
want me to take that?

00:28:02.015 --> 00:28:02.890
CAROLINE HUMER: Sure.

00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:04.310
RICHARD FRANK: OK.

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:09.650
This has been a debate that's
been going on since 2010

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:11.090
within the administration.

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:14.990
The Affordable Care Act,
within the Affordable Care

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:18.620
Act was all the authority you
need for the FDA commissioner

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:22.280
to, one, define
interchangeability

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:23.990
and set the guidance
for doing that.

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:33.740
Provide proprietary names,
and even more importantly,

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:39.080
set up a sort of rapid
process for review.

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:43.190
And all of those have
been very sluggish.

00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:48.950
Moreover, on the
payment side, what

00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:51.800
you could imagine being
done and was proposed

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:55.700
was to put all of these
drugs under one price,

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:57.140
under one code.

00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:00.710
And so therefore, if you have
a cheap drug and a high drug,

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:06.350
you get a much better deal
if you go for the biosimilar,

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:08.930
or the generic in this case.

00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:10.800
That hasn't happened.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.250
And that's also not
so much an FDA problem

00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:17.880
but the Center for Medicare
and Medicaid problem.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:20.870
But all of those things
are within the authority

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:23.870
of the administration and
would have a dramatic effect

00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:26.570
on competition.

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:33.920
CAROLINE HUMER: So to look
a little bit at competition.

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:37.760
One of the things that comes up
a lot, Steve, for you, I think,

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:42.350
is where should these drugs be
priced at in the first place.

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:46.130
And you know, what are
they actually worth,

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:47.720
what is the value of them?

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:50.120
Can you maybe just
talk a little bit

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:53.720
about the idea of an
independent evaluation

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:57.380
and how that might help
fix the problem in the US

00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:58.145
with these prices?

00:29:58.145 --> 00:29:59.000
STEVEN PEARSON: Sure.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.499
Well, as we've all been talking
about, and as you mentioned,

00:30:01.499 --> 00:30:02.700
this is a complex system.

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:04.779
So there's no one silver bullet.

00:30:04.779 --> 00:30:06.320
No matter what you
think it might be,

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:10.130
it's going to have to be a
real sustained thrust with lots

00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:12.680
of different features having
to do with competition

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:14.640
and other aspects as well.

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:18.050
So I mentioned the way that
drugs are kind of-- new brand

00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:19.490
drugs have been priced.

00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:23.180
It's kind of what I hope
will be viewed as old school

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:28.760
more rapidly than not,
because a very common way

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:31.040
to think about how
the price should

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:35.160
be aligned with the benefit to
patients is to measure that.

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:36.680
I mean, we get a
lot of that data

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:40.670
from the trials that are
used to get FDA approval.

00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:44.330
We find out whether the drugs
extend the length of life

00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:47.796
for patients and/or improve
their quality of life.

00:30:47.796 --> 00:30:49.670
Sometimes that's by
having fewer side effects

00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:51.510
or whatever it might be.

00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:53.480
Now, you can kind
of just do a Gestalt

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:56.540
and say, well, it seems a little
bit better or a lot better.

00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:59.720
But you can actually do
cost effectiveness analysis,

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:03.492
which really tries to measure
it in a quantified way, not

00:31:03.492 --> 00:31:05.700
just in the short term but
really over the long term.

00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:07.820
So we capture the real
long-term benefits

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:12.110
to patients and the real
long-term possibilities

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:14.270
that, even if it's
expensive upfront,

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:17.240
it might reduce hospitalizations
or doctor's visits

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:19.850
or other things that will
kind of balance that out.

00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:22.040
So you wrap that
all together and you

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:24.800
can scale a price at how
much higher it should

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:28.190
be than our best current
care, if something is better,

00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:30.130
by how much better it is.

00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:32.297
And you scale it to the
wealth of the country.

00:31:32.297 --> 00:31:34.130
So we would actually--
one of your questions

00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:36.390
is, why are the price
is high in the US?

00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:38.930
We're a very wealthy country.

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:42.770
For a given gain in health, we
would pay more in this country

00:31:42.770 --> 00:31:45.020
than they would
in a poor country.

00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:47.270
That's kind of OK.

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:50.810
So it doesn't bother me to see
lower prices in some countries.

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:53.690
It's basically their ability
to pay, their willingness

00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:56.120
to pay, given their
other societal needs.

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:58.640
Well, we do have other
societal needs, too.

00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:01.400
We have education and
defense and the environment.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:03.600
So we can't spend
everything on health.

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.660
So again, you scale
up the price so

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:09.020
that you get a reasonable
additional cost for an added

00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:10.250
health gain.

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:12.260
And that's a really
good place to start,

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:15.170
I think, in part because
it sends the right signals

00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:16.850
to manufacturers.

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:20.120
We want you to go out and
hit a home run for patients.

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:22.040
We want you to
demonstrate that it really

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.350
improves their quality of
life or length of life.

00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:27.410
We're going to handsomely
reward you if you do.

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:29.830
But if you come to
us with this much,

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:31.670
and it's smudgy
around the borders,

00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:33.865
and you haven't
done good studies,

00:32:33.865 --> 00:32:35.240
and we're still
in a system where

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:40.049
you can name your own price,
again, that should be obsolete.

00:32:40.049 --> 00:32:42.590
The fact that you could charge
us a lot more even though it's

00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:45.380
just like this, and we
don't have many options

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:46.770
to do something else.

00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:48.260
So I'm hoping that we're moving.

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:50.720
And I think we are
seeing some movement, not

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:53.150
at the federal government
level yet necessarily,

00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:55.250
but in the private system
and some of the state

00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:57.560
Medicaid programs, I
think we're starting

00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:01.530
to see some movement towards
seeing pricing as a way

00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:04.410
to reflect the added benefit
to patients as a good anchor

00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:05.442
from which to start.

00:33:05.442 --> 00:33:07.900
LEEMORE DAFNY: And if I could
just summarize what you said,

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:11.100
the manufacturers do think a lot
about the prices that they set.

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:13.350
But the purchasers, they
don't think very much

00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:17.220
about the prices
they're willing to pay.

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:20.130
STEVEN PEARSON: I would say
that's because, even if they,

00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:22.890
traditionally, if they said,
I'd like to pay $100 for this,

00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:25.080
but the company is
charging me $200,

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:27.630
the time they put into figuring
out that 100 wasn't worth too

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:29.445
much, because they're going
to have to pay 200 anyway.

00:33:29.445 --> 00:33:29.730
LEEMORE DAFNY: Mmm.

00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:30.900
STEVEN PEARSON: That's
part of the problem.

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:32.441
LEEMORE DAFNY: And
the reason they're

00:33:32.441 --> 00:33:36.090
going to have to is they're
not willing to make trade-offs

00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:40.650
and evaluate what's the value
added of this medication,

00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:42.720
and this is how much
it's worth to us.

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.930
We don't see a variety of
products on the market--

00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:48.330
an older formulation of
insulin, newer formulation

00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:50.370
with different prices,
and then choices

00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:52.860
for physicians and
their patients.

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:56.510
So the demand side
is very inelastic.

00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:58.574
So of course, they
end up paying.

00:33:58.574 --> 00:33:59.740
STEVEN PEARSON: That's true.

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:00.920
AARON KESSELHELM:
And not only that--

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:02.310
I think it's more
than they're not

00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:03.270
willing to make those choices.

00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:05.853
I think that sometimes they're
not able to make those choices.

00:34:05.853 --> 00:34:10.440
We have laws and rules about
not excluding certain drugs

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:12.030
from formularies.

00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:16.020
Various states have laws about
coverage of certain drugs.

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:20.431
And when you have
rules about the way

00:34:20.431 --> 00:34:22.139
that Medicare and
Medicaid is implemented

00:34:22.139 --> 00:34:24.690
that forces insurers to
cover all these products,

00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:26.280
then yeah, they
could say, great, I'd

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:29.010
love to pay only $100,
but the manufacturer says,

00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:31.380
well, the law says
you have to cover it,

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:34.110
and we have a patent so we're
the only manufacturer that's

00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:36.520
making the product, and
so we say it's $200,

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:39.139
and that's what you're
going to pay us.

00:34:39.139 --> 00:34:42.120
CAROLINE HUMER: And I think that
one drug we could talk about

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:44.250
along those lines is Humira.

00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:47.199
It's the biggest drug in the US.

00:34:47.199 --> 00:34:50.409
Their global sales
are $19 billion.

00:34:50.409 --> 00:34:52.590
There is competition,
more or less.

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:56.159
There are other drugs out
there to treat the same things.

00:34:56.159 --> 00:34:58.680
It's the biggest drug
for government spending.

00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:02.820
And I know, Richard, that
you have looked a little bit

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:04.470
at the issues.

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:06.360
This is a drug that
the price goes up

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:08.010
every year in the double digits.

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:09.000
It hasn't stopped.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.630
That's driven it up to--

00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:15.750
basically, I think it's
over $10,000 now a year

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:16.860
for that drug.

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:21.050
And what are some of the
ways that the government,

00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:24.930
as such a big spender and big
payer, can harness its power

00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:27.810
or change the way its
buying drugs like this

00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:29.537
to reduce the cost?

00:35:29.537 --> 00:35:30.370
RICHARD FRANK: Yeah.

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:32.610
So I think, going
back to the beginning,

00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:37.530
there are really a limited
number of drugs out there

00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:43.560
that are really high cost, that
have little or no competition,

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.990
that you can focus on
through negotiation.

00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:49.470
The question is,
how do you do that?

00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:52.170
Because you have, in
a sense, two problems.

00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:56.430
You need to have the system
set up that sort things

00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:58.464
out when there's disagreement.

00:35:58.464 --> 00:36:00.630
And you have to have some
protection that you're not

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:05.040
going to drive the price
so low that, in fact,

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:07.860
there won't be any
incentive for innovation,

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:11.670
and there won't be an ability
to make enough money to get

00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:12.900
a reasonable return.

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:16.680
And so there have been
several ideas put forth.

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:19.980
One of them has been
binding arbitration.

00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:23.700
And we use that for a lot
of other necessary services

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:24.920
in this country.

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:28.050
Like when police
and firemen have

00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:32.190
a labor dispute over wages,
they're not allowed to strike.

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:35.940
So what you do instead is you
submit to binding arbitration.

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:40.170
And there are rules
that define that.

00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:42.690
And we do it in the
most important products,

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:45.160
which is the NFL.

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:49.959
And how we sort things
out that way there.

00:36:49.959 --> 00:36:51.000
So that would be one way.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.400
Another way would
be to, in a sense,

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:58.660
have a methodology set
out along the lines

00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:03.900
that Steve might design
to set a fallback price.

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:06.540
And if there isn't
agreement, then there

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:10.160
would be some analysis
done that would then

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.460
define a fallback price.

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:15.420
But that wouldn't be known until
after the negotiations failed

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:17.190
so that everybody
would have an incentive

00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:21.279
to come together and
negotiate a fair price.

00:37:21.279 --> 00:37:23.320
AARON KESSELHELM: Does
that seem possible, Steve?

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:25.951
Could we get to that?

00:37:25.951 --> 00:37:27.450
STEVEN PEARSON:
Anything's possible,

00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:31.940
depending on how challenging
the budget issues become

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:34.370
and how much political
pressure is focused

00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:36.770
on any one particular area.

00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:38.870
There's a lot going on
in Washington any day

00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:40.820
of the week or month.

00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:43.820
But prescription
drugs are particularly

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:47.570
relevant because over 50% of
Americans take them every day.

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:50.900
And it's something that touches
our families both clinically

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:53.700
and their pocketbook.

00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:56.900
The problem is also that
we all want innovation.

00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:59.810
We all want the next
great CAR-T drug

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:02.330
that's going to take a
pediatric cancer patient who

00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:04.760
was going to die in six
months and is giving them

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:07.790
two, three years more,
maybe it's a cure.

00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:09.560
I mean, these are
things that don't happen

00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:11.720
with every new drug,
but we have to make sure

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:14.000
that we have the
resources to handsomely

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.750
reward and incentivize
those kinds of home runs

00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:20.210
and not squander them where
we fail to discriminate,

00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:21.930
as I was talking about before.

00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:22.970
So I do think--

00:38:22.970 --> 00:38:26.180
one thing-- when you hear about
Medicare negotiation, it does

00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:28.580
actually sound easy
on the surface,

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:31.910
but once you get even one layer
down, it gets really tricky.

00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:34.100
Does that mean
that Medicare would

00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:38.960
have one national formulary and
kick one drug out of the market

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:42.710
entirely to get the best
price on another one?

00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:44.360
If so, if they've
got that much power,

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:46.250
why wouldn't they
have, as you said,

00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:49.400
maybe run the risk of driving
the price down too low?

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:51.150
Because there's always
more money to save,

00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:52.566
if you drive the
price down lower,

00:38:52.566 --> 00:38:54.390
and if you're the
only game in town.

00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:59.060
So we are uniquely American in
all good and maybe questionable

00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:02.430
ways, but the idea of
a national formulary

00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:05.600
is hotly debated, even
in progressive circles.

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:08.420
So arbitration is an
interesting alternative,

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:12.470
or other options in which we
try to let the free market work.

00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:15.650
But again, I've heard about it
called baseball arbitration,

00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:18.230
where the two
sides come together

00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:21.830
and the ultimate arbitrator
can't split the difference.

00:39:21.830 --> 00:39:23.810
They have to pick one
offer or the other

00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:25.075
at the end of the day.

00:39:25.075 --> 00:39:26.450
And that means
that everybody has

00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:28.340
to be as reasonable as possible.

00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:31.910
And more likely than
not, in that situation,

00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:34.310
I think the
companies will really

00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:37.490
refer to data on how well
their drugs help patients.

00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:40.070
They won't make vague claims
about needing a high price

00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:42.167
to sustain future innovation.

00:39:42.167 --> 00:39:44.750
They'll really kind of get down
to how well their drugs really

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:45.530
work.

00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:48.120
And the payers will probably
do something quite similar.

00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:52.119
So it all depends
on the budgetary--

00:39:52.119 --> 00:39:53.660
you know, how many
years before we go

00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:55.640
broke in Medicare
and other ways.

00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:58.130
But with an aging baby
boomer population,

00:39:58.130 --> 00:40:01.790
with fantastic innovation
in the pipeline, which

00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:03.140
is without a doubt--

00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:06.262
the genetic science is
coming to fruition--

00:40:06.262 --> 00:40:07.970
I think we're going
to have to figure out

00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:09.761
some new ways forward,
because what we want

00:40:09.761 --> 00:40:11.300
is a grand bargain.

00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:14.640
We want a fair price, and we
want that drug to be accessible

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:16.310
so Pamela Holt
doesn't have to pay

00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:19.610
$10,000 each year out of
her own pocket for it.

00:40:19.610 --> 00:40:20.850
And we're not there yet.

00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:23.090
So I really hope we
wake up in five years

00:40:23.090 --> 00:40:25.640
and we've achieved, one
way or the other, some kind

00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:27.598
of grand bargain, because
that's the way that's

00:40:27.598 --> 00:40:29.060
going to help real patients.

00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:32.030
CAROLINE HUMER: And
so far, those kinds

00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:35.120
of arrangements between
payers and drug companies

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:39.020
have been very limited to a
few drugs where it's well known

00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:41.210
that the drugs are working well.

00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:44.180
So there's quite a
road ahead to that.

00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:47.720
And in the meanwhile, it seems
that the pharma companies

00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:51.710
are doubling down even on
their co-pay coupon policies

00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:55.430
to try to make the drugs
more affordable for patients.

00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:58.580
And Leemore, I just wanted
to hear a little bit more

00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:04.520
about how those programs affect
people's price sensitivity, how

00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:08.210
it affects this pricing,
and what could or should

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:09.087
change there as well.

00:41:09.087 --> 00:41:09.920
LEEMORE DAFNY: Sure.

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:11.960
Well, I think that
regulators need

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:15.020
to give further
thought to the policies

00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:17.510
vis-a-vis co-pay coupons
and patient assistance

00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:21.890
programs because having the
manufacturers of medications,

00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:24.830
who are responsible
for setting the prices,

00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:28.340
also be the ones who
are issuing coupons

00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:32.990
and/or making tax-deductible
donations to foundations that

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:35.060
then turn around
and help patients

00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:37.820
bear their cost sharing
component of the drugs

00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:41.000
is like having a fox
guard the henhouse.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.840
So if these
co-payment coupons are

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:47.762
banned for Medicare
and Medicaid,

00:41:47.762 --> 00:41:49.220
although they have
low co-payments,

00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:51.290
but Medicare enrollees--
and the reason

00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:53.090
is they're viewed as kickbacks.

00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:55.310
They're not banned for
commercial enrollees.

00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:59.360
And I personally was able to do
a study on one particular kind

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:03.530
of coupon, which are coupons
for branded molecules

00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:05.960
when there are generic
bioequivalents available.

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:08.840
And unsurprisingly,
availability of the coupons

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:11.780
leads to increase in utilization
of the branded drugs.

00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:14.330
It doesn't actually
increase total utilization

00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:17.000
of the molecule or any
evidence of improved adherence.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.922
It does increase
spending substantially.

00:42:19.922 --> 00:42:21.380
That's just the
tip of the iceberg.

00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:24.710
That's just when you know
there's an identical copy

00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:26.170
of the drug available.

00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:30.790
A bigger issue is when
there are a variety of drugs

00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:34.130
without perfect
bioequivalents and the coupons

00:42:34.130 --> 00:42:38.810
prevent us from really caring
how much the drug is priced.

00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:41.750
And some of these programs will
pay all of your deductible.

00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:43.460
And you probably
heard some stories

00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:47.222
about how some insurers are
fighting back and saying,

00:42:47.222 --> 00:42:49.430
you know what, if somebody
else pays your deductible,

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:50.540
it's not going to count--

00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:52.010
these co-pay
accumulator programs--

00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:54.530
it's not going to count toward
your deductible, and partly

00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:58.370
why should a patient who takes
a drug that has a coupon not

00:42:58.370 --> 00:43:01.700
have to foot her deductible
when another patient who

00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:06.090
has to have expensive treatments
that don't have coupons does?

00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:08.510
So there's a lot of--
there's inequity in that.

00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:10.760
And just even
thinking about this,

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:13.340
you can imagine that
it's entirely broken.

00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:15.590
So the one thing in
the Trump pricing plan

00:43:15.590 --> 00:43:18.020
that kind of surprised
me was to see

00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:20.750
mentioned that maybe
these co-pay coupons

00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:23.000
should be permitted
for Medicare enrollees,

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.670
because that would very
likely lead to more price

00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:27.000
inflation and higher prices.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.190
So I'm kind of
puzzled by that one.

00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:34.730
CAROLINE HUMER: And I guess one
of the parts of this new co-pay

00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:38.150
back and forth between the
payer and the drug company

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:39.950
is the consumer in the middle.

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:43.400
So have you noticed that that
has increased their exposure,

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:46.160
if suddenly the
deductible is not

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:47.670
covered by the drug company?

00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:50.330
It seems like one day,
you're not paying anything,

00:43:50.330 --> 00:43:51.700
and the next, you are.

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:52.575
LEEMORE DAFNY: Right.

00:43:52.575 --> 00:43:54.210
I mean, certainly
consumers-- it's

00:43:54.210 --> 00:43:56.390
the coincidence
of the deductibles

00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:58.670
and the rising
prices of drugs that

00:43:58.670 --> 00:44:01.580
has got this topic
in the news so much,

00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:03.530
because as I said
before, the stats

00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:06.140
show that we aren't
spending more out of pocket,

00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:09.080
but it's very visible
to us because we

00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:10.350
have the deductibles.

00:44:10.350 --> 00:44:15.020
So there is some pressure
on the manufacturers.

00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:19.670
And if the insurers implement
these accumulator programs

00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:22.070
where they don't allow the
manufacturers to offset

00:44:22.070 --> 00:44:26.360
the spending, then we get
a little bit more demand

00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:26.960
sensitivity.

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:29.900
But the consumers in the
middle, let me just be clear,

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:32.130
that isn't really the
optimal way to go.

00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:35.030
We don't actually want
chronically ill patients

00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:39.110
to be like Pam
Holt. We don't want

00:44:39.110 --> 00:44:42.470
them to be any more
disadvantaged than they already

00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:43.140
are.

00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:46.970
So ideally, we wouldn't have
a one-size-fits-all policy.

00:44:46.970 --> 00:44:50.390
We would have
value-based co-payments,

00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:54.290
and we'd have patients
with chronic diseases

00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:57.454
taking high value drugs
at very low cost to them.

00:44:57.454 --> 00:44:58.370
CAROLINE HUMER: Great.

00:44:58.370 --> 00:44:59.270
Thanks.

00:44:59.270 --> 00:45:00.967
Lisa, do you have any questions?

00:45:00.967 --> 00:45:02.300
LISA MIROWITZ: Caroline, thanks.

00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:05.180
Yes, we have a number of
them coming in right now.

00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:09.980
So let's start with
this one from Jacob

00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:14.690
who's with the Special Committee
on Aging with US Senate.

00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:18.290
Are we seeing the European
Federal Institute's agencies

00:45:18.290 --> 00:45:21.340
you mentioned take US
prices into account

00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:24.650
while evaluating cost
effectiveness of a new drug?

00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:27.590
Specifically for
specialty medications,

00:45:27.590 --> 00:45:30.582
but also in the entire space.

00:45:30.582 --> 00:45:32.540
STEVEN PEARSON: I should
probably take that on.

00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:34.070
No.

00:45:34.070 --> 00:45:36.440
Basically, when you do a
cost effectiveness analysis,

00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:39.974
you would want to take the costs
in your own health care system.

00:45:39.974 --> 00:45:41.390
Actually, even
sometimes the drugs

00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:45.140
would be compared to a different
kind of best standard of care

00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:46.170
in a different country.

00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:48.620
It can differ from
what you see in the US.

00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:50.190
So they would not.

00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:52.700
They're aware that our prices
are, in general, higher,

00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:56.930
but that doesn't factor into
their own consideration.

00:45:56.930 --> 00:46:00.080
A few countries do
kind of a crosswalk

00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:02.270
just to make sure how
their prices ultimately

00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:05.300
compare to a basket of
other developed countries.

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:07.310
To my understanding,
for a while the US

00:46:07.310 --> 00:46:10.220
was part of that basket for
some countries like Canada.

00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:12.470
But because our prices
have become so high,

00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:15.050
they've tended to kick the
US out of their comparator

00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:17.330
because they don't want
to falsely peg themselves

00:46:17.330 --> 00:46:18.780
to a higher price.

00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:21.140
So they tend to peg
themselves to other countries

00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:23.825
where the pricing is more
in line with their own.

00:46:23.825 --> 00:46:24.700
LISA MIROWITZ: Great.

00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:25.200
Great.

00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:25.790
Thank you.

00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:27.290
We'll take some
from online and then

00:46:27.290 --> 00:46:30.890
we can check the
studio audience here.

00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:31.610
Let's see.

00:46:31.610 --> 00:46:34.760
I guess this might be
a question for Richard.

00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:37.970
What are your thoughts
on the six protected drug

00:46:37.970 --> 00:46:40.190
classes in Part D?

00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:42.500
Do you think these
should be eliminated?

00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:47.820
RICHARD FRANK: The
answer is some.

00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:53.120
The six protected
classes in Part D

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:58.160
touch on HIV drugs,
psychotropic drugs.

00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:00.710
And the original
idea behind them

00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:06.770
is that they were, at
that time, mostly branded,

00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:08.960
and they were different
enough from one another

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:12.800
in the responses of patients
who were different enough

00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:15.680
that you didn't know
it till they had taken

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:19.560
the drug, that people
were hesitant to allow

00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:22.520
for aggressive formularies
to be applied in those areas.

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:26.930
The world has
changed since then.

00:47:26.930 --> 00:47:30.230
For example, antidepressants
are now mostly generic.

00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:35.660
So there's-- you don't need to
go one way or the other on that

00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:38.696
one, because there's lots
of competition there now.

00:47:38.696 --> 00:47:40.070
But to the extent
that you wanted

00:47:40.070 --> 00:47:42.170
to try to drive things
down a little bit further,

00:47:42.170 --> 00:47:44.960
it's probably not
necessary anymore

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:47.150
to have a protected class there.

00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:49.830
For anti-psychotics, it may
be a little bit different.

00:47:49.830 --> 00:47:53.690
And so I think when you
start getting there,

00:47:53.690 --> 00:47:56.360
you're talking about
extraordinarily vulnerable

00:47:56.360 --> 00:48:00.650
populations where there's a
tremendous amount of harm that

00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:05.460
can be done from
the wrong causes.

00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:08.480
But in principle, you'd
like to have as few of those

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:10.640
as you possibly could.

00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:12.890
STEVEN PEARSON: Sometimes I
just-- if you don't mind--

00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:15.650
if you can imagine
the analogy whereby

00:48:15.650 --> 00:48:18.860
the government-- private
insurance and Medicare is

00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:19.980
required.

00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:22.430
Well, maybe pick the
Defense Department.

00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:27.050
What if they were required to
buy Lockheed's new airplane

00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:30.740
at the price that
the company decides,

00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:33.957
no matter how much better it
was than the current plane

00:48:33.957 --> 00:48:34.790
that they're flying?

00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:37.679
I mean, you can imagine we would
just kind of furrow our brow

00:48:37.679 --> 00:48:39.470
and say, now, why would
any government want

00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:41.190
to pay for airplanes that way?

00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:44.360
Now, drugs, as you said,
in vulnerable populations

00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:46.250
are very different.

00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:49.100
But the economics of creating
a market in which you

00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:52.700
have to cover every single
drug and you can't, in a sense,

00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:54.590
compete them head
to head, and you

00:48:54.590 --> 00:48:58.520
have to accept the prices as
determined by the manufacturer,

00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:01.580
it's a perfect storm
for the rising prices

00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:03.096
that we tend to see in the US.

00:49:03.096 --> 00:49:04.970
RICHARD FRANK: An
important thing now to note

00:49:04.970 --> 00:49:09.300
is that there are
other tools available.

00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:14.584
So for example, you can have
various utilization management

00:49:14.584 --> 00:49:16.000
techniques-- prior
authorizations,

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.300
et cetera-- applied to those.

00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:21.020
And so that gives the
plans a little bit

00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:22.160
of negotiating power.

00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:25.040
But Steve is largely
right, and it's really

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:29.210
a matter of how bad are the
harms that you can possibly do

00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:31.334
from being overly restrictive.

00:49:31.334 --> 00:49:33.750
LEEMORE DAFNY: And you really
diminish access with those--

00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:34.090
RICHARD FRANK: Right.

00:49:34.090 --> 00:49:34.950
That's what I meant.

00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:36.920
LEEMORE DAFNY: --those programs.

00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:38.240
LISA MIROWITZ: Thank you.

00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:39.170
OK.

00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:42.320
This is from Sanjeev
Sriram How do

00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:44.480
we help more Americans
understand that they

00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:45.980
are paying twice for drugs--

00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:50.600
once when their taxpayer
dollars fund NIH-backed research

00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:54.290
on for medications, and again
when the drug corporations

00:49:54.290 --> 00:49:57.770
demands exorbitant prices
for those medications?

00:49:57.770 --> 00:50:01.460
Drug corporations are
spending more on marketing

00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:03.930
than R&amp;D. We've had a couple
of questions about this,

00:50:03.930 --> 00:50:04.910
so I know--

00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:06.830
AARON KESSELHELM:
So it is the case.

00:50:06.830 --> 00:50:10.580
And we've done a lot of research
in our group on this topic.

00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:15.470
The key transformational
drugs that emerge in the US

00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:18.620
and around the world
originate, in many cases,

00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:20.180
from publicly-funded sources.

00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:24.722
And there is a substantial
amount of taxpayer investment

00:50:24.722 --> 00:50:26.930
not only in the basic science
and translational side,

00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:29.330
but sometimes all the way up
into the product development

00:50:29.330 --> 00:50:29.900
part.

00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:31.530
And we talked about
the CAR-Ts earlier,

00:50:31.530 --> 00:50:34.100
and those originated in
publicly-funded science

00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:35.490
as well.

00:50:35.490 --> 00:50:38.850
And then what happens
is ultimately,

00:50:38.850 --> 00:50:43.614
when a product emerges
and is synthesized,

00:50:43.614 --> 00:50:44.780
then there's a patent on it.

00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:47.660
And the pharmaceutical
manufacturers

00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:48.980
then control the patent.

00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:50.810
And so they're able
to control the prices

00:50:50.810 --> 00:50:56.030
and control much of the
revenue that then comes in.

00:50:56.030 --> 00:50:59.120
And then the question
asker is very

00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:03.170
true in that a substantial
amount of spending

00:51:03.170 --> 00:51:05.960
on drugs in the
United States comes

00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:11.460
from Medicare and Medicaid,
which are funded by government.

00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:13.170
Those are government
dollars as well.

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:18.530
And so it is the case that
there is a substantial amount

00:51:18.530 --> 00:51:22.860
of support for a great
deal of innovation,

00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:25.190
particularly the most
important key innovation

00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:27.470
that comes through.

00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:29.240
and that, I think,
is something that

00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:31.694
does need to be better
recognized and then

00:51:31.694 --> 00:51:33.860
also potentially taken into
account as we're talking

00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:35.926
about what a fair price is.

00:51:35.926 --> 00:51:36.800
LISA MIROWITZ: Great.

00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:38.480
Thank you.

00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:40.377
Do we have any questions
from the audience?

00:51:40.377 --> 00:51:41.835
Does anyone want
to ask a question?

00:51:47.090 --> 00:51:48.590
AUDIENCE: Hi my
name is Naomi Sephi.

00:51:48.590 --> 00:51:52.100
I'm a health policy student
here at the Chan School.

00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:56.300
My question is regarding
the European market.

00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:57.950
A lot of the
pushback that we see

00:51:57.950 --> 00:52:00.230
from pharmaceutical
companies, as he said,

00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:05.120
is that lowering drug prices
will stifle innovation.

00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:07.910
Do we see that happening
in European markets?

00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:10.100
Are we seeing these
companies drown,

00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:15.380
or are they able to remain
sustainable and continue

00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:17.630
innovating even when
the government is

00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:20.450
able to negotiate prices?

00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:23.990
STEVEN PEARSON: Views on
that are so across the board.

00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:29.090
So you've heard, and I've heard,
passionate, eloquent, informed

00:52:29.090 --> 00:52:34.880
arguments that we overpay only
because the Europeans underpay.

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:38.690
I've heard passionate, eloquent
responses from economists

00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:39.380
that--

00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:41.870
now, why exactly,
if they paid more,

00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:43.820
would the companies
decide to charge us less?

00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:46.070
Why wouldn't they keep
charging us the same price?

00:52:46.070 --> 00:52:48.390
Isn't more profit what
they're supposed to do?

00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:53.330
And on the other
hand, I do believe

00:52:53.330 --> 00:52:55.490
that the ecosystem
for innovation

00:52:55.490 --> 00:52:57.440
is unparalleled in this country.

00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:59.180
Your ability to raise
venture capital,

00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:01.910
to link up to the NIH science--

00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:04.414
the best federal funding for
basic science in the world--

00:53:04.414 --> 00:53:06.830
and to get that into the market,
into the clinical trials,

00:53:06.830 --> 00:53:08.810
to work with academics--

00:53:08.810 --> 00:53:13.400
if you talk to people in Europe
they salivate at what we have.

00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:19.640
So my hope is that there isn't a
black and white ultimate answer

00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:23.960
to this, where we can make
this kind of unlimited claim

00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:27.410
that we need the prices as
they, or even more, to sustain

00:53:27.410 --> 00:53:30.800
the innovation that we've
got and that any percent

00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:35.840
off the top will instantly
cripple innovation and stifle

00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:36.470
it.

00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:38.900
I think there are
ways to believe

00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:41.480
that the companies have
generally very high profit

00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:41.990
margins.

00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:44.144
There's a lot of risk,
and a lot of reward,

00:53:44.144 --> 00:53:45.560
but I think we
have a very healthy

00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:47.240
pharmaceutical industry.

00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:49.130
And I really do believe
that many of them

00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:51.380
feel that, ultimately,
their strategic interest is

00:53:51.380 --> 00:53:56.750
in having some more kind of
reliable and universal system

00:53:56.750 --> 00:54:01.164
in which the prices are
maintained and scaled

00:54:01.164 --> 00:54:03.830
in a way that's more sustainable
for the economies in which they

00:54:03.830 --> 00:54:04.730
live.

00:54:04.730 --> 00:54:07.890
Because otherwise, it's a
race to the bottom or the top,

00:54:07.890 --> 00:54:10.070
depending on how you look at it.

00:54:10.070 --> 00:54:12.440
And so I think we
have some recognition,

00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:14.240
even among the
manufacturing community,

00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:17.120
that old school
pricing and old schools

00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:19.940
ways of justifying
it just aren't

00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:21.540
going to cut it going forward.

00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:24.620
RICHARD FRANK: Can I
add some color to that?

00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:30.740
So I think one really
important thing to add to this

00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:35.570
is that a French company
like Sanofi, they

00:54:35.570 --> 00:54:36.860
make money selling here.

00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:40.340
It's not like they
only sell in France

00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:42.500
and, therefore, the only
thing that's going on

00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:47.000
is the money they make in
France to fund innovation.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:48.320
They sell to the United States.

00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:52.130
So to the extent that they
make a lot of their money here

00:54:52.130 --> 00:54:55.010
and a lot of their
returns here, then

00:54:55.010 --> 00:54:59.150
that affects the investment
in those companies.

00:54:59.150 --> 00:55:01.220
But it's not because
the companies

00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:07.130
are French or German or Swiss
per se that their innovation

00:55:07.130 --> 00:55:08.327
prospects are different.

00:55:08.327 --> 00:55:10.910
AARON KESSELHELM: I also think
we should think about what kind

00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:12.170
of innovation we want.

00:55:12.170 --> 00:55:15.150
And if their system is set up,
as Steve talked about earlier--

00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:17.733
if the system is set up in the
United States that you can make

00:55:17.733 --> 00:55:19.246
a lot of money
with a little bit--

00:55:19.246 --> 00:55:20.870
basically, putting
a little bit of risk

00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:23.480
to make a very small amount
of change to a product,

00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:26.252
then as a for-profit
manufacturer,

00:55:26.252 --> 00:55:27.710
that's where you're
going to invest

00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:29.250
the lion's share of your money.

00:55:29.250 --> 00:55:32.389
And so I think we not only
need to think about innovation

00:55:32.389 --> 00:55:34.930
in general but we need to think
about what kind of innovation

00:55:34.930 --> 00:55:36.650
that we want to
try to incentivize

00:55:36.650 --> 00:55:39.830
and whether or not the system
that we have currently set up

00:55:39.830 --> 00:55:41.950
is incentivizing the
right kind of innovation.

00:55:41.950 --> 00:55:44.654
And unfortunately, I think,
in many cases, it's not.

00:55:44.654 --> 00:55:46.820
STEVEN PEARSON: Caroline,
can I return to a question

00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:48.920
that you asked earlier,
just because I--

00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:49.280
CAROLINE HUMER: Yes.

00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:51.029
STEVEN PEARSON: Because
I know, sometimes,

00:55:51.029 --> 00:55:54.530
even after a full hour, it just
seems so complicated, right?

00:55:54.530 --> 00:55:56.360
And the Trump
blueprint won't fix it,

00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:58.650
and nothing else will
fix it by itself.

00:55:58.650 --> 00:56:01.160
So people sometimes
can feel this sense

00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:03.480
of just kind of hopelessness.

00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:05.450
I want to mention briefly
two experiments going

00:56:05.450 --> 00:56:08.547
on in the Medicaid system and
in the private market that

00:56:08.547 --> 00:56:10.880
shows that I think people are
willing to take some risks

00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:12.140
and experiment.

00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:15.270
One is the State of New
York's Medicaid program.

00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:19.430
They did pass a law that
allows them to create a target

00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:21.950
spending cap for their drugs
within the Medicaid system

00:56:21.950 --> 00:56:23.450
so that they can
make sure they have

00:56:23.450 --> 00:56:25.340
enough budget for other things.

00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:27.740
If they're exceeding
that spending,

00:56:27.740 --> 00:56:30.590
they are now allowed to pick
out drugs that are contributing

00:56:30.590 --> 00:56:33.680
to that excess spend
and to identify

00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:37.790
a fair value-based price
that they will negotiate down

00:56:37.790 --> 00:56:39.950
to to get an even deeper
discount than Medicaid

00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:42.080
programs usually do.

00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:46.160
And this is the first example of
a public insurer in the United

00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:49.100
States explicitly using
cost effectiveness

00:56:49.100 --> 00:56:52.070
to help it identify what
is a fair price linked

00:56:52.070 --> 00:56:54.200
to the ability to
help patients, and how

00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:57.020
do we create levers
and carrots and sticks

00:56:57.020 --> 00:56:59.260
and things to try
to get us there.

00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:01.010
Briefly, in the private
market-- now, this

00:57:01.010 --> 00:57:02.090
is very controversial.

00:57:02.090 --> 00:57:05.150
It was just announced about
four to six weeks ago.

00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:08.120
CVS, which is obviously one
of the big pharmacy benefit

00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:11.420
managers, it's also a large
self-insured employer.

00:57:11.420 --> 00:57:13.592
And it decided to change
its health insurance

00:57:13.592 --> 00:57:15.050
for all of its
employees, and there

00:57:15.050 --> 00:57:17.570
are a couple of other
companies doing it too,

00:57:17.570 --> 00:57:20.310
where if after they negotiate
to the best of their ability,

00:57:20.310 --> 00:57:23.960
the drug's price for a
new drug that comes out

00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:27.350
doesn't get down to a fair
value-based price as determined

00:57:27.350 --> 00:57:31.260
by actually reports
from ICER, my institute,

00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:34.200
then it won't be covered.

00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:35.160
It's not covered.

00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:37.910
So this sounds like a
European approach, right?

00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:39.990
If it doesn't meet our
cost effectiveness,

00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:42.140
it's not going to be available.

00:57:42.140 --> 00:57:44.750
And it's an early experiment
to see what happens.

00:57:44.750 --> 00:57:47.420
Do we get the prices
down so that they

00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:49.550
can keep the broad
access, or do we

00:57:49.550 --> 00:57:51.170
have drugs that are excluded?

00:57:51.170 --> 00:57:53.990
And really, how do we
manage that kind of tension

00:57:53.990 --> 00:57:55.460
in the US system?

00:57:55.460 --> 00:57:59.420
So I don't mean to overly stress
that these are the right ways

00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:04.340
to move forward, but it's a sign
that the market and the states

00:58:04.340 --> 00:58:05.790
feel the need to move forward.

00:58:05.790 --> 00:58:08.340
And so I think whatever does
happen at the federal level,

00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:10.629
they may end up learning
from these experiments.

00:58:10.629 --> 00:58:12.170
And I think we'll
see a lot of change

00:58:12.170 --> 00:58:14.100
over the next year or two.

00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:15.350
CAROLINE HUMER: Thanks, Steve.

00:58:15.350 --> 00:58:16.940
That is an interesting program.

00:58:16.940 --> 00:58:19.040
And they're grappling
with it right now,

00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:21.500
with the new drug that
came out to treat migraine

00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:22.760
that's quite expensive.

00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:25.885
It doesn't meet their barrier,
so we're watching that closely.

00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:31.070
And so I think
we'll wrap up now.

00:58:31.070 --> 00:58:33.530
It's been a great hour
spending it with you.

00:58:33.530 --> 00:58:36.800
Before we go, I want to
hear from everybody--

00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:38.300
one minute or less--

00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:42.120
your biggest concern and
greatest hope moving forward.

00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:43.277
Let's start with Leemore.

00:58:43.277 --> 00:58:43.860
Are you ready?

00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:44.300
LEEMORE DAFNY: Yep, sure.

00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:45.050
Absolutely.

00:58:45.050 --> 00:58:47.240
Biggest concern is those
ultimately deciding

00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:49.040
what to cover and
at what price won't

00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:51.020
be willing to make
difficult trade-offs-- very

00:58:51.020 --> 00:58:52.811
exciting to hear that
the State of New York

00:58:52.811 --> 00:58:54.170
is willing to give it a stab.

00:58:54.170 --> 00:58:56.450
We tend to be more willing
to try these things out

00:58:56.450 --> 00:58:57.980
on our indigent populations.

00:58:57.980 --> 00:59:01.730
I'd like to see some
more stringent activity

00:59:01.730 --> 00:59:04.950
on the commercial side, and
what CVS is doing is promising.

00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:08.900
Greatest hope is that
we will engage consumers

00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:11.590
more in selection of
their health plans,

00:59:11.590 --> 00:59:13.970
selection of
prescription drug plans,

00:59:13.970 --> 00:59:16.740
give them the option to
select stricter formularies.

00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:22.100
And if they do so, then I think
we'll see a market response.

00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:24.760
STEVEN PEARSON: So I live just
outside of Washington, DC,

00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:26.135
so I have lots of
greatest fears.

00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:32.070
In this domain, it's that--

00:59:32.070 --> 00:59:34.730
and this is true in
Europe, in Australia,

00:59:34.730 --> 00:59:36.230
wherever else you go--

00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:39.410
these issues around drug
prices and access and costs

00:59:39.410 --> 00:59:42.025
and patient care,
they're not easy.

00:59:42.025 --> 00:59:44.150
There's no system that
feels like, oh, this is just

00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:46.610
a smooth process, we
have a decision making--

00:59:46.610 --> 00:59:49.130
everybody's happy at
the end of the day.

00:59:49.130 --> 00:59:53.180
It requires the deepest
effort of a society

00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:57.230
to really grapple honestly with
trade-offs and with limitations

00:59:57.230 --> 00:59:59.540
around what we can
spend and for whom.

00:59:59.540 --> 01:00:00.740
And that's never easy.

01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:03.500
And so my greatest fear is
that, at this particular moment

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:07.250
in our political discourse,
in our public discourse,

01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:10.190
this will be really
hard for us to handle.

01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:12.380
But my greatest hope
is actually born out

01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:14.840
of some of our experience
with public meetings where

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:17.960
we've seen patient groups
really come to the table,

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:19.430
not just for their
piece of the pie

01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:21.590
but seeing the bigger picture.

01:00:21.590 --> 01:00:25.040
And people starting to talk
about this as an ongoing issue

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:28.310
that we as Americans need
to sort out, and hopefully

01:00:28.310 --> 01:00:30.980
in a way that will work for
everybody, because cures

01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:31.594
are coming.

01:00:31.594 --> 01:00:33.510
You'll hear about them
if you haven't already,

01:00:33.510 --> 01:00:36.740
but we're having some fantastic
drugs nearing approval

01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:39.350
that will provide miraculous
treatments for patients

01:00:39.350 --> 01:00:43.460
with long-term diseases like
sickle cell, hemophilia.

01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:45.850
And if we don't
figure this out, we're

01:00:45.850 --> 01:00:49.790
going to have a head-on train
crash between price, cost,

01:00:49.790 --> 01:00:51.200
and access.

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:54.350
So we have to get these systems
and our dialogue sorted out

01:00:54.350 --> 01:00:56.790
because we're going to have
a great problem to deal with,

01:00:56.790 --> 01:00:59.123
which is cures for patients
that we really want to help.

01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:06.060
RICHARD FRANK: I
guess my greatest fear

01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:11.580
is that the politics
of Citizens United,

01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:14.340
which is money
and politics, will

01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:19.440
come to dominate where
we land in our solutions,

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:22.320
because they often
have in the past.

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:27.240
My greatest hope is
that we, I think,

01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:33.750
now have started to recognize
how important competition

01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:36.240
is if we're going to have
a market-driven system,

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:40.080
and that we will aggressively
sweep away the things that

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:43.230
get in the way of that right
now, including especially

01:01:43.230 --> 01:01:46.400
with the biologics side.

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:48.150
AARON KESSELHELM: So
my greatest fear also

01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:50.316
is that a lot of the things
that we're talking about

01:01:50.316 --> 01:01:53.100
may require some legislative
changes, grappling

01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:55.320
with patents, trying
to evaluate the way

01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:56.700
that the government buys drugs.

01:01:56.700 --> 01:02:00.540
And that is problematic
in the current--

01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:02.520
to get sort of these
kinds of major things

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:04.269
done in the current
political environment,

01:02:04.269 --> 01:02:10.320
particularly when there is an
extremely well-funded lobbying

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:12.630
organization on the
pharmaceutical industry

01:02:12.630 --> 01:02:17.995
side that actively poses a
lot of these kinds of changes.

01:02:17.995 --> 01:02:19.620
But on the other
hand, my greatest hope

01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:23.520
is the kinds of efforts that
you see at the state level

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:27.090
and that come out of patients,
because there are surveys out

01:02:27.090 --> 01:02:30.480
there that 75% of patients
think that drug prices are

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.480
a big issue.

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:36.660
And if we really see patients
step forward and make

01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:39.090
their voices heard, I think
that we can actually try

01:02:39.090 --> 01:02:40.484
to push through the gridlock.

01:02:40.484 --> 01:02:41.400
CAROLINE HUMER: Great.

01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:41.910
Thank you.

01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:45.370
Thanks, Aaron, Richard, Steven,
Leemore, for joining us today.

01:02:45.370 --> 01:02:48.300
Thank you to our audience
and to our viewers.

01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:51.870
I'd like to encourage you
to tune into our next forum.

01:02:51.870 --> 01:02:55.980
It is called Conflicts Over
Science and Policy at the EPA--

01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:57.420
Where Are We Headed?

01:02:57.420 --> 01:03:02.100
That one will be October
19 from noon to 1:00 PM,

01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:05.910
also at forumhsph.org.

01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:07.230
Thanks for joining us today.

01:03:07.230 --> 01:03:09.930
