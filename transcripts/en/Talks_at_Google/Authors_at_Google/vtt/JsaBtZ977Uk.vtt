[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.120
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:12.880
TIM NEWBURN: Thank you, Chris.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.380
And thank you,
everyone, for coming.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.990
We were just
talking beforehand--

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.460
it's a big ask giving up three
hours of your working day.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.150
No, it's a big ask giving up
an hour of your working day

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.570
to come and hear a stranger
talk about a subject that you

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.320
may only have just a marginal
interest in, so thank you.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.690
Thank you for the invitation,
Chris, and for hosting.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.640
It's lovely to be here.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.802
So I'm going to talk
about this little book.

00:00:39.802 --> 00:00:42.260
As Chris said, you've obviously
had several talks by people

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.968
doing books in this
series, and I kind of

00:00:43.968 --> 00:00:48.990
imagine that some of them
will start by saying,

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.020
well, it's a very short book--

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.550
a very short introduction
to a subject.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.940
And the challenge-- it's like
that old thing, you know--

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.680
I'd have written you a shorter
letter if I'd had more time.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.800
Actually, trying
to capture things

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.470
in a small number of words
is extremely difficult.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.020
And by way of illustrating--

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.300
I brought along a visual aid
to illustrate at least one

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.480
of the challenges for me.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.920
So I teach criminology
at the LSE.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.820
I teach undergraduates
and post-graduates.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.840
I cover, one way or
another, kind of the range--

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.000
not everything, but
broad range of topics

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.190
under this heading
of criminology,

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.260
this thing that we do.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.970
And a few years ago,
I wrote a textbook.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.940
So I wrote a textbook
for undergraduates.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.400
The intention was to
try to write a book that

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.190
would make some money.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.327
It wasn't an
intellectual enterprise.

00:01:45.327 --> 00:01:46.910
I've written other
things, which maybe

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.865
had some kind of
scholarly interest,

00:01:48.865 --> 00:01:50.240
but the textbook,
fundamentally--

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.615
I mean, there were
other reasons.

00:01:51.615 --> 00:01:55.320
But at the time, I was trying
to make a bit of money.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.510
So I wrote the textbook,
and this is it.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:58.880
So that's it.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.690
This is the third edition,
so it's made a few quid.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:12.080
1,143 pages.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.230
I did a quick word
count on the documents

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.070
when I first sent it in, and
it came in at 505,000 words.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.590
So it's expanded
a bit since then.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.400
So writing this thing was
an interesting challenge.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.920
They're supposed to be
somewhere between 30,000,

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.630
35,000 words or something.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.370
So it's like a really
long essay or some such.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.470
So what I've tried
to do in the book

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.410
is ask a series of questions.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.910
Has anyone here studied
any criminology?

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.470
Oh, god.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.133
To what level?

00:02:50.133 --> 00:02:52.050
AUDIENCE: A degree--
well, I did a law degree.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.154
TIM NEWBURN: A law degree,
but in criminology?

00:02:54.154 --> 00:02:55.450
AUDIENCE: Law criminology.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.880
TIM NEWBURN: Law criminology.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:57.980
OK.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:58.480
Sorry?

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.500
AUDIENCE: Criminal psychology

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.600
TIM NEWBURN:
Criminal psychology.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.100
OK.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.265
So I'm about to get
desperately exposed, probably.

00:03:03.265 --> 00:03:05.140
I was kind of hoping
that everyone would say,

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.730
oh, no, I never
heard of it, really.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.110
Sounded interesting.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.463
OK.

00:03:09.463 --> 00:03:11.380
But what I thought I'd
do within this book was

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.950
to try to cover a
few of the topics

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.840
within criminology that I
thought a general audience-- so

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.050
in the main, people who
either knew relatively little

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.390
or nothing about criminology--
might be interested in.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.250
It might give them
a kind of taster,

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.110
particularly if they wanted to
follow it a little bit further.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.300
So as you can see
on the slide, these

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.030
are the chapter
headings in the book.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.080
It says kind of things
like-- so what's crime?

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.010
A lot of lawyers
in the audience,

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.920
I think, so we maybe have a
quick conversation about that.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.845
Who commits it?

00:03:45.845 --> 00:03:46.720
How do we measure it?

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.790
What's happening to it?

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.740
Bit of a giveaway
in the next one--

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.482
understanding the crime drop.

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:54.440
How do we control it,
and how do we prevent it?

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.770
So I'm going to-- in my--

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.530
however long I've got--

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.538
another 30 minutes or
so-- scoot through.

00:04:01.538 --> 00:04:03.580
I'm going to pick up on
a few of those questions.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.330
Obviously, I can't talk
about the whole book,

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.413
but I'll try and give you
a flavor of four or five

00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:09.100
of those questions.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:15.100
So I'll start with
what's criminology--

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.269
the main one, I suppose.

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.870
So everyone would be
familiar with this.

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.530
You're in a taxi or a party and
someone asks you what you do,

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.720
and you say, well,
whatever you say.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.130
And I, taking a deep breath
and sometimes a sigh,

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.520
say, I'm a criminologist.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.260
To which the kind of
actually quite pleasing

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.510
and standard response is oh,
gosh, that's interesting.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.720
That must be fascinating.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.230
Now, the reason,
unfortunately, and the spoiler,

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.400
that people say that is
that they've, of course,

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.330
got an entire misconception
of what criminology is

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.710
and what criminologists do.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.020
And then, of course,
I bore them rigid,

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.210
and they realize it's
not nearly as exciting

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.740
as they thought that it was.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.260
And the misconceptions
are legion,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.110
so all sorts of reasons,
all sorts of things

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.985
that people think
criminology is or might be

00:05:05.985 --> 00:05:07.890
and criminologists do.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.820
Certainly, for students, a
lot of the time-- criminology

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.900
is burgeoning in
universities now,

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.730
hence people being
able to punt textbooks.

00:05:18.138 --> 00:05:20.680
One of the reasons I think that
students have been interested

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.530
in criminology is the CSI--

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.720
crime scene investigation
time things, the sort

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.890
of forensics and stuff.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:31.300
They kind of imagine we're
sitting in smart Google style

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.570
offices with all the latest
kind of technologies,

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.330
tracking serial killers
and solving crimes

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.420
and various other things.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.630
Now, there are probably
one or two people

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.990
who style themselves as
criminologists who are involved

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.270
vaguely in that kind of thing--

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.280
slightly more
realistically than CSI--

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.880
but most of us are not doing
anything nearly so exciting,

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:52.860
actually.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:53.860
Most of us are teachers.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.943
Most of us are working in
universities for some of you

00:05:56.943 --> 00:05:58.360
who are familiar
with it, teaching

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.430
that thing called criminology.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.463
Now, it's not really a
definable thing, I think.

00:06:04.463 --> 00:06:06.630
So I think the first thing
I'd say about criminology

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.760
is unlike--

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.640
pick your subject-- economics,
social science, sociology,

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.945
political science, psychology--

00:06:15.945 --> 00:06:17.820
criminology is not
discipline, I don't think.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.050
It's not a master discipline.

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.690
Criminology with something which
rests on other disciplines.

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.650
So those people who
are practitioners

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.620
are all of those things--
are lawyers, sociologists,

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.280
historians, political
scientists, psychologists,

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.110
and all the rest.

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.920
And criminology is
a kind of amalgam.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.340
It's the-- excuse
me-- bastard child

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:41.520
of a variety of 20th
century disciplines.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.573
But its focus, I think, is
this thing at the bottom here.

00:06:44.573 --> 00:06:45.990
So there's a picture
of a famous--

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:47.130
probably the most famous--

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.930
20th century criminologist,
a guy called Edwin Seville.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:52.920
He's an American who
worked most of his career

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.940
in Chicago, at the famous
Chicago School of sociology

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.140
and criminology who defines
criminology as essentially

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:04.740
these three things-- the
study of the making of laws,

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.560
the breaking of laws,
and society's reaction

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.160
to the breaking of laws.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.000
So what do we criminalize?

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.090
Which things do we
treat as criminal?

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:15.960
And why?

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:16.920
And how that changes?

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.280
We'll come back to
that momentarily.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.690
What is it?

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:30.100
How do we understand deviance,
the breaking of those rules,

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.976
laws, and so forth?

00:07:32.976 --> 00:07:38.190
And how do we respond to those
forms of deviance, and why?

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:43.090
And how do our social responses
to those things differ?

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:47.520
So that, I think, broadly
speaking, still serves--

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.430
even though it's 80, 90 years
old now-- as a definition,

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:54.840
still broadly serves as
a pretty good indicator

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.270
of what criminology is.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:00.660
So as promised, let's
start with something

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.940
that should be pretty
straightforward, and certainly

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.660
straightforward for
an audience here.

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.270
So the question for us is--

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:08.310
what's crime?

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:10.080
Over to you.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:10.710
What is crime?

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:11.930
Anybody.

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:13.950
And no right answer,
of course, to this.

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:14.505
But what--

00:08:14.505 --> 00:08:15.630
AUDIENCE: Breaking the law.

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:17.250
TIM NEWBURN: Breaking the law.

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.560
Breaking the criminal law.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.520
Breaking the law?

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.850
Yeah, breaking the law.

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:24.475
AUDIENCE: I mean, theoretically
it's breaking the criminal law,

00:08:24.475 --> 00:08:26.790
but how do you deal with
different legislations

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:29.186
across countries?

00:08:29.186 --> 00:08:37.870
So [INAUDIBLE] from a British
point of view, but, I mean--

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:42.340
TIM NEWBURN: So it's
comparatively contingent.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:45.170
Things that we do here
we may not do elsewhere.

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:45.670
Yeah.

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:50.170
So it's the breaking of laws.

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:52.180
But if I'm an academic
who's interested in that,

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:53.740
and I'm simply--

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.050
am I simply interested
in the breaking

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:59.320
of laws within a
particular jurisdiction?

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:03.953
Well, probably not.

00:09:03.953 --> 00:09:05.620
What do we mean by
the breaking of laws?

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:08.920
Does someone actually have to be
caught breaking the law for me

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.780
to be interested in
that as a criminologist,

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.250
or is it forms of
behavior that in principle

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:15.430
could be criminalized?

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:19.480
Or what about those
things which don't

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.890
reach a criminal threshold?

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:24.370
What about that acronym
that became so famous

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:26.180
on the new labor government--

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:31.720
ASBO-- anti-social behavior
order, not criminal offenses--

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:35.110
causing harassment, alarm, and
distress-- so sub criminal,

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:36.610
but entirely the
sort of thing that

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:38.500
was dealt with by
criminal justice

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.070
system in a variety of ways.

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:45.630
Crimes for us, I think,
in all sorts of ways--

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:47.340
and just deal with
this very briefly--

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:50.750
a highly problematic thing, not
least because, as pointed out,

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:55.300
it's culturally relative.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:10:00.550
The way in which we
deal with theft, or rape

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:04.300
outside or inside
marriage, or murder,

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.760
or a whole variety
of other offenses,

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.760
will vary extraordinarily,
potentially,

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:15.180
from country to country,
but also historically.

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:20.180
So what are we allowed
to do, and what's

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:23.758
criminalized at certain points
in time, as we know, changes.

00:10:23.758 --> 00:10:25.550
So first, just very
quickly-- two examples.

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:32.060
Something that's criminal
now that wasn't 100 years ago

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:33.556
in this jurisdiction?

00:10:36.888 --> 00:10:37.840
AUDIENCE: Cybercrime.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.650
TIM NEWBURN: Cybercrime
because it didn't exist.

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:42.622
How about something
that existed?

00:10:42.622 --> 00:10:43.762
AUDIENCE: Smoking inside.

00:10:43.762 --> 00:10:44.970
TIM NEWBURN: Smoking indoors.

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:45.720
I love that one.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.980
That's a cracking one.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:47.760
Tobacco.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.850
So we've criminalized various--

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:52.710
so now the regulation
of tobacco consumption

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:57.060
is really, really tight.

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.760
All sorts of ways in which you
now can't do this, and this

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:00.840
is very, very new.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.780
So what about the reverse, OK?

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:07.095
Things that we now can
do that we couldn't.

00:11:07.095 --> 00:11:10.065
AUDIENCE: Having an affair
[INAUDIBLE] marriage.

00:11:10.065 --> 00:11:11.747
Was that breaking the law?

00:11:11.747 --> 00:11:13.830
TIM NEWBURN: Probably
wasn't criminalized, was it?

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:15.030
But we're close, I think.

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:16.077
AUDIENCE: Gay marriage.

00:11:16.077 --> 00:11:17.160
TIM NEWBURN: Gay marriage.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.660
Very good one.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:22.190
So a variety of things to do
with sexual relationships,

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:24.990
to do with women's
reproductive health.

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:26.700
We could go on and on and on.

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.740
So when we're thinking
about these things,

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:34.260
we need to be critically aware,
both of historical change

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.050
and cultural relativities.

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:40.585
But then criminalization--
so let's just

00:11:40.585 --> 00:11:41.960
think about it a
little bit more,

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.002
and I might come back to
this briefly at the end,

00:11:44.002 --> 00:11:45.300
depending on time.

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.940
The creation of criminals.

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.250
So I think in a lot
of popular discourse,

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:53.280
and a lot of public
conversation about crime--

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.830
political conversation
about crime--

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:58.690
we will use the word
"criminals," and we will--

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:00.240
or I hope I won't.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.190
Some people will use
the word "criminals"

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:05.520
as if there's something
essential about the person.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:12.180
A criminal is a type of
person separate from someone

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:13.468
who's not a criminal.

00:12:13.468 --> 00:12:15.510
So if we go all the way
back to the 19th century,

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:16.440
for those who are
familiar with it,

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.540
kind of the phrenologists
who studied, you know,

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:21.720
the shape of the skull and
the size of the forehead--

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.910
all a bit unfortunate for me--

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:25.500
but physical
characteristics which

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:29.550
were thought to be associated
with criminality-- just,

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:32.340
as it were, the kind of
historical precursors of those

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:36.210
who now think that there are
a variety of other biological

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:39.360
or psychological or
mixed socio-biological

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.390
characteristics which somehow
distinguish the criminal

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:45.000
from the non-criminal.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.270
So are criminals a class apart?

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:51.000
So it's just a question
to think about.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:57.270
So have you, have I, or anyone
in your immediate family done

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:58.258
any of the following?

00:12:58.258 --> 00:13:00.300
And as I say, don't need
to put hands in the air.

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:03.540
I mean, obviously
feel free if you wish,

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.070
but probably best not.

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:07.320
Have you or anyone in your
immediate family, including

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:12.990
me, smoked cannabis,
driven a car

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:16.170
with excess alcohol
in the bloodstream,

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:20.310
stolen something from a
shop, or downloaded music

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:23.460
or some other
material for free when

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:25.350
it should have been paid for?

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:25.870
Right.

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:29.010
So would anyone like to
put their hand up and say

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:32.010
that they think that
neither they nor anyone

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:36.790
in their immediate family has
ever done any of those things?

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:37.290
Don't worry.

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:38.040
You don't have to.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.750
But congratulations
if there is someone

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:44.010
because I reckon you're in
a tiny minority, OK, tiny.

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:50.520
Just very quickly-- studies
of lifetime usage of cannabis.

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.520
If we do a survey,
representative sample

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:57.240
of adults in the
country, what proportion

00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:01.503
will say that they have ever
smoked cannabis, do you think?

00:14:01.503 --> 00:14:02.350
AUDIENCE: 50%.

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:05.040
TIM NEWBURN: Yeah, probably
somewhere between 35% and 50%,

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.440
so one in three, one
in two, somewhere,

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:11.190
depending on where we do it
or how we ask the questions.

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:13.500
Driven a car with excess
alcohol in the bloodstream?

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.780
Well, we don't really
know, but it's--

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:16.280
sorry?

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.310
AUDIENCE: 20%.

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:21.190
TIM NEWBURN: Yeah, I'm not quite
sure, but I reckon you're not--

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:23.133
AUDIENCE: Probably
won't admit that.

00:14:23.133 --> 00:14:24.550
TIM NEWBURN: Well,
a lot of people

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:26.967
won't necessarily know that
they've done it as well, which

00:14:26.967 --> 00:14:27.900
is the other thing.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.610
So if you go to
jurisdictions where

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:32.970
there's very low blood
alcohol levels permitted,

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.428
awful lot of people who will
be caught with excess alcohol

00:14:35.428 --> 00:14:37.720
are caught with it because
they drank the night before,

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:38.460
not on the day.

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:41.420
And it's, as it were, a
genuine mistake, but they're

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:42.670
breaking the law and so forth.

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:44.670
So the numbers are actually
probably pretty high

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:47.070
if we're taking that
as a lifetime thing.

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:48.480
Stolen something from a shop.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:52.170
Again, self report
studies-- really variable.

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:55.480
Estimates vary from 20% to 50%.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:59.670
We'll probably take it somewhere
as being in that range.

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:01.650
Downloaded music
material for free when

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:02.858
they should have paid for it.

00:15:02.858 --> 00:15:03.780
Well, we don't know.

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:07.380
There was a well-known
Australian study of a few

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:11.370
download sites which discovered
hundreds of thousands of people

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:14.418
downloading, illegally,
material in--

00:15:14.418 --> 00:15:16.710
I can't even remember what
it was-- a three or four day

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:18.570
window.

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:21.970
If you extrapolate from it
and do it very carefully,

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:24.090
it means, probably--

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.830
frankly, it means most of
us are breaking that law.

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:27.330
OK.

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:31.497
So the idea, somehow,
the criminals--

00:15:31.497 --> 00:15:33.330
this is a simple thing
I want to establish--

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:37.570
are somehow separate,
are somehow different,

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:39.600
is nonsensical, yeah?

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.270
We all break the
law, if that's going

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:45.940
to be the thing that
determines our discussion here.

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:48.180
So let's just park it,
and we'll maybe come back

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:49.450
to one or two of these things.

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:51.960
But this begs the question--
because most of the things

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.070
that I've been
talking about here,

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:57.003
we've been talking about here--
are maybe not that serious.

00:15:57.003 --> 00:15:59.170
Some people would think
they were terribly serious--

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:01.170
probably drinking and
driving is pretty serious.

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:04.800
Some people will think
drugs are serious.

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.510
But what about really
serious offenses?

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:10.200
What about homicide or
serious violence and so forth?

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:14.940
Does the same thing apply?

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.180
Are there
distinguishing features?

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:19.820
Can we see things
in the constitutions

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:21.548
that make up the
psychologies of people

00:16:21.548 --> 00:16:23.840
who are involved in the most
serious forms of offending

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.280
which distinguish them?

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:29.660
Well, in some cases,
there's psychopathy

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:35.512
and so forth which may play some
role in very serious offending.

00:16:35.512 --> 00:16:37.970
But most of the time, really,
what we're talking about even

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:40.040
there, even in the
most serious offending,

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.290
is what we'd call
risk factors, which

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:50.590
is there are certain
characteristics in people's

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:52.870
physical and
psychological makeup,

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:56.650
but also in their social
environment, which increase

00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:59.920
the likelihood that
they may become involved

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:03.130
in various forms of serious
offending, but usually only

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:07.150
when those risk factors
are found in multiple form.

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:13.000
And even then, that's a kind
of an increase in probability.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.020
It's not predictive,
effectively.

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:17.780
So we have to be
terribly careful.

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.920
So what is crime, and
who are criminals is,

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:24.710
I think, as it
were, subject matter

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:27.490
which is intrinsically complex.

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:29.710
And if I would
want to get, as it

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:32.500
were, one simple message
across from that,

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:36.160
it's that anyone who tries
to therefore persuade you

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:40.600
that our responses as a society
to crime and to people who

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:44.770
break the law are simple
things, that there are somehow

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:48.760
simple solutions to this thing,
are obviously misleading you,

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.790
and obviously haven't understood
the complexity of the world

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:53.199
that they're trying
to deal with.

00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:59.070
I might just go back slightly.

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:01.930
Criminals are class apart
and criminalization--

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:03.600
that second bullet point--

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:07.050
the creation of criminals.

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:10.290
Who do we find?

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:12.660
Has anyone spent any time--

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:14.490
I don't mean as a defendant--

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:18.000
as an observer or something,
or as a lawyer, even,

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.703
in a Magistrates' Court or the
lower courts of any country?

00:18:22.703 --> 00:18:23.370
Been to witness?

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:24.662
What sort of people do you see?

00:18:24.662 --> 00:18:27.270
Who are the defendants?

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:29.640
What type of people, if
you were just broadly

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.472
characterizing them?

00:18:32.472 --> 00:18:34.887
AUDIENCE: They're
not very well-off.

00:18:34.887 --> 00:18:37.310
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:38.830
TIM NEWBURN: Poor, yeah.

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:40.030
They're poor.

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:41.390
Absolutely.

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:44.060
Our courts, especially
our lower courts,

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:46.790
which is where the bulk
of the business gets done,

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:51.962
is full of relatively poor,
disenfranchised people.

00:18:51.962 --> 00:18:53.420
They're the people
who are involved

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.040
in these forms of
crime which make up

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:58.353
the bulk of the business
of our criminal courts.

00:18:58.353 --> 00:19:00.770
It's important to remember
because that's what our justice

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:01.570
system is doing.

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:05.210
Our justice system is broadly
focused on a certain part

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:06.440
of the population.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.750
Frankly, not us,
[INAUDIBLE] has it.

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:10.280
Yeah?

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:12.920
Most of us, most of
the time, are probably

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:17.690
going about our lives
relatively inured against--

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:20.300
relatively insured against--
interaction with the justice

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:21.320
system.

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:26.210
It may happen to you, but
nothing like the likelihood

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:28.790
that it would happen to
you if you were poor,

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:35.130
if you were homeless, or
unemployed, or whatever else.

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:40.130
So just very quickly,
what rarely finds itself

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:42.630
in our justice system?

00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:45.840
Corruption, state
crimes, the crimes

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:49.890
of the wealthy and the
powerful, large scale frauds--

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:53.920
much small scale fraud,
actually-- money laundering,

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:58.800
tax related offenses, health
and safety related offenses,

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:04.060
deaths and injury at work,
the crimes of employers,

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:06.840
and so forth.

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:10.010
Again, just a corrective
to some of the assumptions,

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:13.130
I think, about the ways in
which crime and justice is often

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:14.990
talked about, yeah?

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:18.680
The justice system
focuses on the poor.

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:23.930
It does not focus upon the
powerful and the wealthy.

00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:24.430
So crime.

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:25.120
What is crime?

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.323
That's what's crime.

00:20:26.323 --> 00:20:28.240
What are criminologists
kind of interested in?

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:31.310
Well, there's this--
some beginning to it.

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:33.310
So what's happening to crime?

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:36.200
It's been in the
news just recently.

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:39.210
What is happening to crime
in England and Wales?

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:40.960
Does anyone know what
the pattern of crime

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:42.850
is in England and
Wales in recent times?

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:45.675
Pick your own--
pick your period.

00:20:45.675 --> 00:20:47.050
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
going down.

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:48.258
TIM NEWBURN: It's going down?

00:20:48.258 --> 00:20:50.686
How long has it
been going down for?

00:20:50.686 --> 00:20:51.302
Take a guess.

00:20:51.302 --> 00:20:53.260
AUDIENCE: The current
government were in power.

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:53.590
TIM NEWBURN: Sorry?

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:54.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:56.900
Since the current
government were in power.

00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:57.870
All right, OK.

00:20:57.870 --> 00:21:00.100
So since 2015.

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:00.777
OK.

00:21:00.777 --> 00:21:01.970
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:02.770
TIM NEWBURN: Sorry?

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:04.010
Well, that's what all
politicians will probably

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:04.510
tell you.

00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:06.290
But yeah.

00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:09.980
But then the other
corrective would be this

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:11.840
is not to do with politics.

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:14.630
Politics doesn't
control levels of crime.

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:17.120
Controls much about the
levels of responses to crime,

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:19.120
but we'll come back
to that momentarily.

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:21.690
So not since 2015, a little
bit longer than that actually.

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.760
[INAUDIBLE] another guess?

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:26.806
I'll be [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:26.806 --> 00:21:27.580
AUDIENCE: 2011?

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:28.510
TIM NEWBURN: 2011.

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:29.656
Little bit earlier.

00:21:29.656 --> 00:21:30.490
AUDIENCE: 2008.

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:32.313
TIM NEWBURN: A
little bit earlier.

00:21:32.313 --> 00:21:33.230
Come on, be confident.

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:34.080
AUDIENCE: 1930.

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:34.830
TIM NEWBURN: 1930.

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:36.940
[LAUGHS] Very good.

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:37.800
OK, so enough.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:38.300
Right.

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:39.900
Mid-1990s.

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:42.350
So this is England and Wales.

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:45.110
What's happening to crime?

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:47.180
So far as we know,
and I'm going to--

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:48.685
all sorts of caveats here.

00:21:48.685 --> 00:21:49.560
I'll come back to it.

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:54.530
So far as we know, crime rose
pretty steadily from somewhere

00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:58.640
in the late 1950s through
to about the mid-1990s,

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:01.370
and then it started to decline.

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:04.790
And according to the main
measures that we have,

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:07.800
it's been in decline
for the last 20 years.

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.890
And not just in decline,
but in steep decline.

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:12.710
So if you look at
the general trends

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:16.250
there on the left and the
right, you can see the peaks,

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:20.870
and you can see just how
steep the decline seems to be.

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:25.890
So the question
is, how do we know?

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:27.520
Well, two measures of crime.

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.540
The first is what we've
called police recorded crime

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:31.080
statistics.

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:34.320
It's basically the data
collected by law enforcement

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:36.840
agencies-- the police
in England and Wales,

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:40.510
the police departments, the
FBI in the US, and so forth.

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:43.830
So they collect things.

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:46.140
Then, according to
administrative rules,

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:48.600
they divide them up into
different kinds of categories--

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.120
the kinds of things that you
then find as criminal offenses

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:51.960
in the courts--

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:55.860
and the measure over time gives
us a sense, on the left here,

00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:59.190
of what's happening to
reported crime trends.

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:03.180
Now, there's a whole heap of
problems with reported crime

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:04.710
statistics.

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:07.870
The most obvious ones are the
very simple ones, of course,

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:11.520
is all that is recorded
there is stuff that comes

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.750
to the attention of the police.

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:17.360
How much crime comes to the
attention of the police?

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.650
Way less than half.

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:22.327
So huge amount of stuff
is never being recorded.

00:23:22.327 --> 00:23:24.410
Then, even if it comes to
the attention of police,

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:25.620
will they record it as crime?

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:28.010
Well, not necessarily.

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:30.250
They're supposed to, and
they're supposed to do it

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:33.700
in standardized ways, but
for a variety of reasons,

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:36.790
some perfectly understandable,
some less forgivable,

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:39.440
they don't.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:42.040
And so it's pretty iffy.

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:45.550
So therefore, in this country,
from around the 1980s,

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:47.740
we used another measure.

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:51.063
We decided that we'd use a
standard social scientific

00:23:51.063 --> 00:23:52.480
technique to try
to measure crime.

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:55.480
So we do a survey, basically--
a household survey.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:58.390
We take a representative
in [INAUDIBLE] sample

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:01.552
of the population,
and ask them questions

00:24:01.552 --> 00:24:03.760
about what they've experienced
in the last 12 months.

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.340
Have they been victims of
a whole range of crime?

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:08.120
Plus a bunch of other questions.

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.120
It's originally called
the British Crime Survey,

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:12.580
now called the Crime Survey
for England and Wales.

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:15.000
It's the measure on
the right hand side

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.230
there, hence only
starting in 1981.

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:24.880
But it's broadly considered to
be our most accurate measure

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.710
of crime.

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:28.120
And that's kind
of what it shows.

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:30.500
Now, there's a whole bunch of
problems with the British Crime

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.583
Survey, or the Crime Survey
for England and Wales.

00:24:32.583 --> 00:24:33.340
As well.

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:35.150
I won't go into loads of detail.

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:37.570
I'll come back to one
at the end of what

00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:42.160
I've got to say this
afternoon, but as I've said,

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:43.790
it's a survey of households.

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:46.293
So it doesn't include
anybody who's not living

00:24:46.293 --> 00:24:47.460
in a standardized household.

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.330
It doesn't include
people who are homeless,

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:52.930
doesn't include students,
doesn't include prisoners,

00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:55.520
and so on and so forth.

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:59.650
And until very
recently, the interviews

00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:01.700
were only with people
aged 16 and above,

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:04.000
so it didn't
include young people

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.530
who have very high
levels of victimization.

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:12.240
But broadly speaking, that's
what's happening to crime.

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:15.250
There's America, looks
very similar pattern.

00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:18.080
Peaks slightly earlier
than England and Wales,

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:20.050
but it's the same broad pattern.

00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:23.410
These are FBI reports,
so the kind of police

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:25.270
recorded crime type thing.

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:26.290
That's Canada.

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:29.240
Just the top line is all
one needs to look at.

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:30.850
It's the same general trend--

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:33.700
peaks in the early 1990s,
in decline ever since.

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:37.230
So this is not something
specific to England and Wales.

00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:40.390
This has been watched across
Western liberal democracy.

00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:43.840
A broad rise in crime
through to somewhere

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:49.870
around the late '80s, early
'90s, and then a drop, and what

00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:53.530
appears to be a
sustained drop in crime.

00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:56.100
So why?

00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:58.800
Why is crime falling?

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:00.910
Now, I'd better do
this quite quickly.

00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:02.880
But how many?

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.280
Six quick reasons, possibly.

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:08.130
So one's economics.

00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:11.550
Is economic change driving--

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:15.970
well-- the rise and
the fall in crime?

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:18.330
The answer, I think, is no.

00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:23.460
It may be having an effect,
but it's not clear, I think,

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:27.720
how much of an effect, or what
the effect relationship, as it

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.370
were, is.

00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:35.370
So we've had one of the most
significant economic downturns

00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:38.970
in the last decade or so,
a period in which crime

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:39.870
has been going down.

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:41.578
If there were going
to be a relationship,

00:26:41.578 --> 00:26:43.560
you would expect it to
be the other way around.

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:46.870
That is, you would
expect, I think,

00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:50.530
the disappointing and negative
economic circumstances would

00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:51.970
lead to increases in crime.

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:55.150
And to the extent I think that
we have reliable information

00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:57.370
about these things,
there is something

00:26:57.370 --> 00:27:02.890
of a relationship between
economic recessions and rises

00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:05.170
and falls in property crime--

00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:07.990
not violent crime, necessarily,
again, I think for reasons

00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:09.880
that one can imagine.

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:13.060
But the bulk of research about
the nature of the relationship

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:21.640
between the economic fortunes
of societies and crime levels

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:26.590
is, I think, at best mixed--

00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:31.230
shows no clear and
consistent relationships.

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:33.610
There's probably
slightly better evidence

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:35.590
about the nature of
social inequality,

00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:39.130
or the relationship between
social inequality and crime,

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:44.500
but again, I think that's also
quite general and certainly

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:46.960
not enough to explain
the things that I think

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:50.350
we're seeing in terms of
really significant increases

00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:53.440
and declines in crime.

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:59.740
So what, then, about the
politicians' favorite thing--

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:00.970
punishment?

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:03.580
The assumption in a lot
of political discourse

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:06.400
is if crime is out
of control, we're

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:08.560
just not taking it
seriously enough,

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:10.780
and we must get tougher.

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:13.300
That was the political
message of the 1990s

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:15.220
across the political
spectrum in this country

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:18.680
and, indeed, in the US,
for example, as well.

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:22.240
So more punishment
equals less crime,

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:25.300
and superficially it
might look like it.

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:29.920
This is, I think, in some ways,
one of the most terrifying kind

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.500
of basic bar charts
you can produce

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:36.860
in terms of recent trends
in crime and punishment.

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:41.560
This is the federal and
state prison population

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:44.360
and incarceration rate-- you can
ignore the incarceration rate

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:45.777
if you'd like for
the time being--

00:28:45.777 --> 00:28:50.470
in the United
States, 1950 to 2013.

00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:55.420
And basically, what you see is
the numbers of people in prison

00:28:55.420 --> 00:29:01.150
was relatively stable
in the 1950s, 1960s--

00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:03.920
really up until the late 1970s--

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:09.940
and then it exploded and
rose and rose and rose

00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:14.230
at an extraordinary
rate to the point

00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:17.830
at which the incarcerated
population of the United States

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:22.880
reached 2.3 million people.

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.490
2.3 million people.

00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:30.140
So something the equivalent of--

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:32.510
I'm going to forget which
American cities now--

00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:37.250
but the populations of
something like two or three

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:40.220
sort of medium sized
American cities incarcerated

00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:41.760
at any point in time.

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:45.290
But, of course,
differentially imposed.

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:46.490
Who's incarcerated?

00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:48.380
Well, who's
incarcerated of course

00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:51.020
reflects who comes
before the courts--

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:56.200
the poor, minorities-- African
Americans in particular.

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:58.330
In specific geographical
areas-- so you've

00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:00.420
got suburbs of American
cities-- you've

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:02.680
got neighborhoods
in American cities

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:05.490
where somewhere
between one and two,

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:08.890
one in three, young
African-American men

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:13.880
aged between 20 and
35 are in prison, just

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:15.350
terrifying figures.

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:19.560
So you've got this huge
increase in punishment roughly

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:21.980
at a time, or just preceding
the point at which,

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:23.430
crime starts to fall.

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:27.230
So looks pretty good for
politicians, I think.

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:31.040
But actually, just start to
do some fairly basic things,

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:34.910
and the relationship between
changes in the uses of just

00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:38.150
imprisonment, in this case,
is the most serious form

00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:39.860
of punishment,
really, that we have.

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:42.860
Some states obviously still
have the death penalty

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:44.480
but only use it
in small numbers.

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:49.190
The relationship between rises
and falls in imprisonment

00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:53.240
and rises and falls in crime
is just hugely inconsistent.

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:55.100
Just across the bar
chart here, you've

00:30:55.100 --> 00:31:00.560
got states which show
dramatic increases

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:07.970
in the use of imprisonment,
but actually very

00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:11.190
small rises in crime,
and the reverse.

00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:14.030
No consistent
relationship at all

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:17.060
between patterns of
punishment and crime,

00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:22.040
which is not to say punishment
has no effect, but if we try--

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:26.820
or as people have tried-- to
estimate its impact, frankly,

00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:29.810
in terms of the American
crime decline in recent time,

00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:37.100
the best estimate suggests
the imprisonment boom--

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:39.830
what some people would call
mass incarceration in the United

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:40.940
States--

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:44.150
the greatest possible extent
that it influenced the crime

00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:47.550
decline was maybe 10% to 15%.

00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:50.780
So the remainder is being
affected by other things--

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:53.760
possibly the economy in part--

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:57.590
but it must be a variety
of other factors.

00:31:57.590 --> 00:32:00.370
One possibility, and a
famous one in the US,

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:04.210
is the suggestion is that
policing made a big difference.

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:09.610
Now, the reason that this
got so much play in the US

00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:13.750
is largely because of the
so-called New York miracle.

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:19.000
From the early 1990s onwards,
serious crime in New York City

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.880
declined, and declined hugely.

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:24.250
So some bare figures
there-- these

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:26.280
are what the Americans
call index crimes.

00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:30.190
These are the main crimes that
go to make up law enforcement

00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:31.340
statistics.

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:36.010
And you can see that across
homicide, burglary, larceny,

00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:37.360
forcible rape--

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:41.320
the declines in less than
a decade in recorded crime

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:46.150
are between a third and 3/4
across all categories of crime.

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:50.080
Or if you reverse it, as
I've done there for homicide,

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:52.720
and take from 2007--

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:56.590
the homicide level in
2007 in New York City

00:32:56.590 --> 00:33:00.350
was 18% of the 1990 level.

00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:05.720
So by any measure, something
extraordinary happened.

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:08.870
Now, the smiling face,
some will recognize,

00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:12.920
is Rudolph W. Giuliani,
two-time mayor of New York City,

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:16.910
and subsequently-- well,
let's not go there.

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:18.680
He hired a man
called Bill Bratton

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:22.460
as his first commissioner of
police for a couple years.

00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:24.380
Bratton then went onto
the private sector,

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:27.740
then to LA, and then
back to New York City.

00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:30.140
Between them, two
media savvy people,

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:33.380
essentially they stole the
story that the crime decline--

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:35.840
the New York miracle--

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:37.990
was the result of policing.

00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:45.020
Yeah, crime is down, blame the
police was their tag line, OK?

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:46.900
Is it true?

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:50.390
Well, actually, I
think the same thing

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:51.900
that I've concluded,
essentially,

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:53.610
about the economy
and about punishment,

00:33:53.610 --> 00:33:56.400
probably applies to
policing, which is, yeah,

00:33:56.400 --> 00:34:00.670
I think it makes a contribution,
but it explains only

00:34:00.670 --> 00:34:03.880
a small part of the picture.

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:08.610
So slightly complicated
multicolored bar chart.

00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:10.540
Don't really need to
pay too much attention.

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:12.460
Essentially, what
you've got there

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:15.340
is those main index
crimes again--

00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:18.199
homicide, rape, robbery,
assault, et cetera, et cetera.

00:34:18.199 --> 00:34:22.300
And the colorful
lines are what's

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:28.070
happened to each of those crimes
in the 10 main American cities.

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:31.630
So basically, crime has
been going down, as we saw,

00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:32.980
across the US.

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:37.150
All its big urban centers have
experienced really significant

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:38.949
declines in crime.

00:34:38.949 --> 00:34:43.449
But the black line in all
of these is New York City.

00:34:43.449 --> 00:34:46.310
And you can see that
in almost all cases,

00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:49.270
the decline in New
York City is bigger--

00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:53.889
bigger than LA and Chicago,
Houston, wherever else.

00:34:53.889 --> 00:34:57.560
Now, one interesting
study, I think,

00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:59.260
which analyzed in
great detail what

00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:03.520
happened in New York City
said, well, look, actually

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:05.860
the crime decline that
we've seen in US cities

00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:07.540
can't be put at the
door of the police.

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:10.750
What the police did
differed from urban center

00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:13.750
to urban center, so
it's hard to use it,

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:16.870
I think, as a sort
of simple explanation

00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:18.610
for what we've witnessed.

00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:22.010
But maybe, and there's evidence
to suggest this is possible,

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:24.340
that, as it were,
the crime dividend

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:27.760
in New York City-- the extra
decline that they witnessed--

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:31.810
was largely a
product of policing.

00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:36.760
The particular strategies that
the New York Police Department

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:40.420
operated in the 1980s
and beyond may well

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:43.540
have contributed to this
somewhat greater decline

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:46.240
in crime that New York
experienced compared

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:49.375
with its major urban peers.

00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:54.050
What would those things be?

00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:57.770
Well, very simply,
essentially, policing

00:35:57.770 --> 00:35:59.030
has two major strategies.

00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:02.660
One is to do with numbers,
which is a matter of controversy

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:06.680
in this country, and this city
in particular at the moment.

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:11.690
Numbers increased dramatically,
much more in New York City

00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:13.500
than in other American cities.

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:16.490
But also, and something
I'll come into momentarily,

00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:21.740
depending on time, it also got
a little smarter in the way

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:22.590
it did policing.

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:25.310
It concentrated, it
focused its resources

00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:28.490
on those places where
crime was concentrated,

00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:31.550
and on those things which were
likely to have the greatest

00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:32.640
impact.

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.300
And so maybe policing.

00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:39.060
Security and prevention
is the fourth possibility.

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:42.080
So there's now something within
criminology called the security

00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:46.730
hypothesis, which essentially
says the real way in which we

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:52.220
got smarter from around about
the 1980s onwards was in terms

00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:56.120
of crime prevention was rather
than thinking about post

00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:59.330
hoc things, like punishment--

00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:02.660
crime gets dialed in,
flash the blue lights,

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:05.462
pick up the perpetrator,
stick them through a court,

00:37:05.462 --> 00:37:06.920
and then imprison
them, and imagine

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:09.080
we've solved a problem--

00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:10.880
frankly, is not the way.

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:12.690
What we need to be
thinking is proactively.

00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:14.650
Where are the problems?

00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:16.960
What's the sources
of those problems?

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:20.357
And can we do
something about them?

00:37:20.357 --> 00:37:22.690
Now, there's something called
routine activities theory.

00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:25.650
Those who've studied criminology
may have come across this.

00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:28.080
It's essentially a
rational choice theory.

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:32.110
It treats us all as rational
actors, for good or ill,

00:37:32.110 --> 00:37:35.620
and kind of says, look, in the
main, when people do stuff--

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:37.150
bad stuff--

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:41.190
they do it because they're
making a calculation.

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:44.710
They're making a calculation
that this is in some way,

00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:46.390
however partial
their rationality,

00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:49.110
this is in some way worthwhile.

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:52.920
So routine activities
theory divides, as it were,

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:56.910
what it calls the chemistry
of crime into three things.

00:37:56.910 --> 00:37:59.620
Some nice little scientific
sheen to it there.

00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:02.520
It says there'll be three
things-- a motivated offender--

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:06.000
so someone who wants to steal
something or do some other

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:06.990
thing--

00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:10.890
a suitable target-- something
they want to steal or some

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:13.050
train they want to graffiti--

00:38:13.050 --> 00:38:14.910
and an absence of
capable guardians--

00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:19.260
so an insufficient
kind of variety of folk

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:21.930
out there who will stop
them from doing it.

00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:26.310
And basically, it says look, if
you change any of those things,

00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:29.970
you're likely to make crime more
difficult. And if you do that,

00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:32.300
actually, it will reduce.

00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:34.450
So the three-- well,
there are more than three,

00:38:34.450 --> 00:38:37.420
but three central
things that you can do.

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:41.820
One is you can increase
the effort that's

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:44.810
involved in crime.

00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:46.250
Whole variety of
ways-- so there's

00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:50.960
a picture of alley gates
there-- very simple thing.

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:56.090
But British terraced
houses have back

00:38:56.090 --> 00:38:58.460
alleys where bins
used to be kept.

00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:01.700
People now, as a kind of
fairly standard thing,

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:04.160
have started putting
up gates with locks

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:06.900
to stop people being able
to wander up and down.

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:09.560
We have a variety of
techniques which--

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:12.240
locks become more sophisticated.

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:14.120
We have lights that go on.

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:16.370
We have all sorts
of things to try

00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:19.730
to make places or
people more secure,

00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:23.100
which doesn't stop someone
from breaking into a house,

00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:25.130
for example, but might
make them think twice.

00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:28.780
It makes it slightly
more difficult.

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:32.320
Or we can increase
the perceived risks.

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:34.360
The most obvious
one being we can

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:36.340
make people feel
they're being watched,

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:38.320
which is a favorite
one in this country

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:41.140
because we are the
world capital of--

00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:42.040
AUDIENCE: CCTV.

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:43.240
TIM NEWBURN: Absolutely.

00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:44.110
Does it work well?

00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:45.880
Evidence is mixed,
but we don't have

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:47.200
to press ourselves further.

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.540
But nonetheless, we can
do a variety of things

00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:52.960
to try to increase
the perceived risks--

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:55.480
change the kind of mentality.

00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:57.560
Or we can reduce the
anticipated reward.

00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:00.490
So there's a picture
there of a train

00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:02.680
covered in colorful graffiti.

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:04.450
Back to New York City.

00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:07.990
There was a huge problem
in New York City subway

00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:11.170
in the '80s and the '90s--

00:40:11.170 --> 00:40:14.980
one of the problems--
trains covered in graffiti.

00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:19.750
Now, part of the strategy of
the transit police and the NYPD

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:21.370
was to try to do
something about it,

00:40:21.370 --> 00:40:23.660
alongside all the other
things they were trying to do.

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:27.790
How do you reduce
graffiti on the subway?

00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:32.180
Actually, it turned out
to be relatively simple.

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:37.020
They cleaned the trains, and
they cleaned them regularly.

00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:39.450
So as soon as graffiti
appeared, they

00:40:39.450 --> 00:40:43.230
took the trains into the
yard, cleaned them down,

00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:46.920
washed them down, and put
them back into service.

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:48.990
Over time, and actually
relatively quickly,

00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:52.110
it had the impact of--

00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:56.160
not stopping-- but massively
reducing the graffiti problem,

00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:59.010
the reason being motivation.

00:40:59.010 --> 00:41:05.560
Why does the tagger want
to put graffiti on a train?

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:08.600
Well, partly it might be
quite fun, the process.

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:10.030
They're artists after all.

00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:12.490
But no, fundamentally
it's about being seen.

00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:13.730
It's the tag.

00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:15.620
It's the public visibility.

00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:18.610
So if you get rid of that, if
you get rid of the pay off,

00:41:18.610 --> 00:41:21.760
the argument was,
actually, you'll

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:24.610
reduce the problem, yeah?

00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:26.680
Now, how am I doing for time?

00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:28.490
Couple of minutes.

00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:30.690
So the security hypothesis.

00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:35.710
We have become really smart
at doing a variety of things

00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:37.060
in relation to crime.

00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:41.660
So an obvious one here is cars.

00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:43.900
So when I was a kid,
which was, obviously,

00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:47.950
as you can tell looking
at me, some time ago now--

00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:49.450
I'll say it more
now more strongly--

00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:53.470
I knew some people who were
interested in stealing cars.

00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:56.560
Stealing cars was
really easy to do.

00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:00.940
It was really easy to do because
cars had almost no security

00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:03.963
facilities.

00:42:03.963 --> 00:42:06.130
So there was a particular
make, and I forget it now,

00:42:06.130 --> 00:42:08.530
but there was a Ford, and
it was either a Cortina

00:42:08.530 --> 00:42:11.760
or an Escort, or something
like that, which--

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:14.260
certainly the urban myth had
it, and even if it wasn't true,

00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:17.230
it wasn't a million miles away--

00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:22.070
there were only about a
dozen keys in existence

00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:25.080
which would open every
single one in the country.

00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:28.430
There were no such thing as
a unique key for the car.

00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:33.500
Essentially, manufacturers had
got away for years, decades,

00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:35.390
with not having,
or not bothering,

00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:38.390
to think about the crime
implications of the business

00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:40.160
that they were running.

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:42.830
One of the things that we've
done in the last 30 years,

00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:44.960
or manufacturers
have done, sometimes

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:48.290
under pressure from governments,
is to massively change now

00:42:48.290 --> 00:42:51.200
the ways in which
cars are configured,

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:54.170
making car theft
extremely difficult to do,

00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:58.250
the consequence being a
plummet in car crime--

00:42:58.250 --> 00:43:01.950
a huge influence-- a huge drop--

00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:04.070
itself being a
volume crime, which

00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:06.590
has contributed very
significantly to the crime

00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:07.090
drop.

00:43:07.090 --> 00:43:10.130
And the arguments and
the security hypothesis

00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:13.910
is that actually, if
you stop car crime,

00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:17.180
you make young
people in particular

00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:19.280
who might get involved
in other forms of crime

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:22.230
much less mobile.

00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:26.370
And actually, you then stop
other forms of crime as well.

00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:28.320
So just reading
across, the arguments

00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:33.360
of the security hypothesis
is that essentially, we've

00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:35.400
become, across a
range of things,

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:39.690
much, much smarter
at prevention,

00:43:39.690 --> 00:43:42.640
and that, arguably,
is the single greatest

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:47.570
contributor to the crime
drop of the last 20 years.

00:43:47.570 --> 00:43:51.100
So a couple of final
things and I'll stop.

00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:57.070
There is one problem with
crime prevention ideas.

00:43:57.070 --> 00:43:59.900
One major one is
called displacement,

00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:03.160
which is that sense of
well, if you make crime more

00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:09.190
difficult to do around Victoria
Station, well, maybe people

00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:13.450
will go to Waterloo, or St.
James' Park, or Embankment,

00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:16.302
or the next one along.

00:44:16.302 --> 00:44:19.570
If you make crime more
difficult in one state or one

00:44:19.570 --> 00:44:22.700
part of the state, maybe people
will simply go elsewhere.

00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:24.640
And so to a degree,
there is evidence

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:28.300
to suggest that some of the time
that is true, but not always.

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:31.810
And quickly, there is
a really famous story

00:44:31.810 --> 00:44:34.720
called the British gas
suicide story, which

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:37.670
sounds all very depressing,
but it's very illuminating.

00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:41.060
And essentially, it's
a simple picture here

00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:46.660
which shows the decline
in suicide in the 1960s

00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:51.670
and through the 1970s, largely
as a result of changing

00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:54.070
domestic gas supplies.

00:44:54.070 --> 00:44:59.070
Up until the 1960s, domestic
gas supplies were toxic.

00:44:59.070 --> 00:45:01.320
Carbon monoxide in
the domestic gas

00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:03.685
supplies-- an awful lot
of people, very sadly,

00:45:03.685 --> 00:45:05.310
opened their ovens,
put their heads in,

00:45:05.310 --> 00:45:07.200
and killed themselves.

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:10.130
The domestic gas
supplies were changed,

00:45:10.130 --> 00:45:13.460
making them no longer
toxic, with the effect

00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:16.760
that that form of suicide,
that method by which people

00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:21.320
ended their lives, of course,
declined almost to nothing.

00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:23.900
What was interesting about
it though, for the purposes

00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:28.790
here, is that it didn't result
in any great number of people

00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:32.010
finding alternative means
of killing themselves.

00:45:32.010 --> 00:45:34.460
So actually, there
was no displacement.

00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:39.030
It was a preventative effort,
and a long standing one.

00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:41.030
Now, I'm running out of
time, so I won't do it,

00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:44.510
but there is some
evidence which goes

00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:48.020
in a slightly different
direction in relation

00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:51.680
to catalytic converters in
cars, which again has had

00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:55.670
the same impact of
stopping that, largely,

00:45:55.670 --> 00:46:01.380
as a means of ending one's life,
but in that particular case,

00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:05.420
it does seem to have
a displacement effect.

00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:06.890
Three final points
and I'll stop.

00:46:06.890 --> 00:46:09.060
Thank you for your patience.

00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:12.823
So there's two final
slightly left field theories,

00:46:12.823 --> 00:46:14.240
which you've
probably heard about,

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:17.780
which I'll just say a brief
word about about the crime drop.

00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:20.880
One comes from the
book "Freakonomics."

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:23.670
Famous economist
and a journalist

00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:29.490
who wrote a hugely bestselling
book, he says enviously,

00:46:29.490 --> 00:46:34.380
about a variety of applications
of economic ideas to real world

00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:37.650
problems, and one of them
is the crime decline.

00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:41.100
And their arguments in the book
is that in the United States,

00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:46.680
the changes relating to
the constitutional position

00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:50.167
of the termination of
pregnancy, so the Roe vs. Wade

00:46:50.167 --> 00:46:51.750
decision that was
taken by the Supreme

00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:55.320
Court in the early 1970s,
had an impact on crime.

00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:57.870
Broadly speaking, a very
controversial argument

00:46:57.870 --> 00:47:03.570
is that from 1973 onwards,
legalized abortion

00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:06.540
was generally freely available.

00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:10.050
Those people who were most
likely to take advantage

00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:13.320
of this new possibility
were those women

00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:17.460
who were predominantly
in the social groups,

00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:22.120
in categories who would be
at greatest risk, as it were,

00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:25.230
of having children who would
go on later in life, for all

00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:27.360
the risk factors I was
mentioning earlier,

00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:29.910
to become involved in crime.

00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:32.510
Now, actually, they
terminate their pregnancies,

00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:33.840
don't have those children.

00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:35.820
There's a cohort
of young people who

00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:39.900
would have been more criminal
who now weren't, and hey,

00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:42.950
presto, actually, the point at
which they would have started

00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:46.630
offending, in any
number, is round

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:49.180
about the point at which
crime starts to decline.

00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:53.010
So about 16 years or
so, 17 years or so,

00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:55.620
after Roe vs. Wade.

00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:59.760
Sounds very neat-- actually
not necessarily that plausible.

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:01.240
First of all--
well, two reasons.

00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:04.170
Firstly, that
actually the evidence

00:48:04.170 --> 00:48:08.340
doesn't suggest, or doesn't
support terribly strongly,

00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:10.290
the idea that,
frankly, those were

00:48:10.290 --> 00:48:14.580
the women who mostly
took advantage

00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:17.490
of the new legal situation.

00:48:17.490 --> 00:48:19.920
But secondly, and I think
even more damningly,

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:22.350
it doesn't apply anywhere else.

00:48:22.350 --> 00:48:24.830
So in England and
Wales, abortion

00:48:24.830 --> 00:48:28.490
was legalized seven
years before it was

00:48:28.490 --> 00:48:30.830
the case in the United States.

00:48:30.830 --> 00:48:34.280
Crime began to drop probably
about three to four years

00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:35.490
later.

00:48:35.490 --> 00:48:39.740
So the lag makes no sense
in terms of the hypothesis.

00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:43.050
And then, finally,
lead in petrol.

00:48:43.050 --> 00:48:45.740
Lead in petrol is
a fascinating one.

00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:47.930
Why might this have an impact?

00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:51.350
Because lead in
petrol is very closely

00:48:51.350 --> 00:48:54.740
associated with a variety
of behavioral disorders

00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:56.330
in young people--

00:48:56.330 --> 00:48:59.570
impulsiveness, aggressiveness,
and a whole variety

00:48:59.570 --> 00:49:01.650
of other things.

00:49:01.650 --> 00:49:06.080
But we removed it, or
it's declined massively,

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:09.020
and it links very much
in the same kinds of ways

00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:10.850
the previous
arguments in relation

00:49:10.850 --> 00:49:15.230
to termination of pregnancy
with a slightly lagged delay

00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:16.400
in the drop in crime.

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:19.580
And the great thing about
the lead in petrol argument

00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:22.650
is that it would also help
you explain the rise in crime

00:49:22.650 --> 00:49:24.530
as well as the fall
because of the increasing

00:49:24.530 --> 00:49:27.710
use of motor vehicles
in the post-war period.

00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:31.140
Now, there's an ongoing
academic debate about this,

00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:35.210
and, again, all I'll say is I
think the evidence is extremely

00:49:35.210 --> 00:49:37.910
mixed on this subject.

00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:39.950
Probably not something
we shouldn't at all

00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:43.850
discount, but again,
and unlike many

00:49:43.850 --> 00:49:46.490
of the things that
I've already discussed,

00:49:46.490 --> 00:49:49.850
probably treat it as being
no more than one contributory

00:49:49.850 --> 00:49:51.980
element in the
things that we need

00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:57.500
to be thinking about when
considering this complex issue

00:49:57.500 --> 00:49:59.660
of the crime decline.

00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:02.080
So my final sentence,
then, will be

00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:05.710
that's, I think, how
we might explain it--

00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:08.200
by thinking about all those
things and probably more things

00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:11.380
besides, but with
a but, which is,

00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:14.514
actually, is it
really declining?

00:50:14.514 --> 00:50:15.470
Ah.

00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:23.090
Now, the parallel here-- so
a few years ago, the LSE,

00:50:23.090 --> 00:50:25.535
like so many universities, is--

00:50:25.535 --> 00:50:28.610
well, like Google, actually--
expanding its campus

00:50:28.610 --> 00:50:29.850
in all sorts of ways.

00:50:29.850 --> 00:50:31.760
We like nothing better
than a new building,

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:35.985
shows the university's
being successful.

00:50:35.985 --> 00:50:37.610
Pay the staff more,
I say, but anyway--

00:50:37.610 --> 00:50:39.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:43.370
No, on Lincoln's Inn
Fields, a few years back,

00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:45.260
we opened a new building.

00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:48.620
And the queen, bless her,
came along to open it,

00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:52.520
and the director, the vice
chancellor, of the LSE

00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:56.270
was there, and two or three
senior academics, a couple

00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:58.470
of whom were economists.

00:50:58.470 --> 00:51:02.460
And in her very low key
way, in this opening

00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:04.578
as she walked through
to unveil the plaque

00:51:04.578 --> 00:51:06.120
or whatever, in her
very low key way,

00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:09.400
she turned to one of
these economists and said,

00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:14.040
I'm interested to know why
you didn't spot that there was

00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:16.640
going to be a financial crash.

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:18.600
Was a kind of stunned
silence in the room,

00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:20.310
and lots of activity
in later years

00:51:20.310 --> 00:51:22.650
to try, then, to explain
exactly what had been going on.

00:51:22.650 --> 00:51:30.120
But anyway, this octogenarian
had embarrassed the assembled

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:33.480
economists of the LSE.

00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:35.220
So I say this partly
because, of course,

00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:37.890
criminologists are prey to
exactly the same things.

00:51:37.890 --> 00:51:45.210
If we went back to the 1960s,
criminologists, generally I

00:51:45.210 --> 00:51:48.180
think, were of the
view that fairly soon,

00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:52.200
this increasing crime trend
that was going on would stop.

00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:56.610
And as we became more prosperous
and social democratic,

00:51:56.610 --> 00:51:59.690
it would peak and then
it would start to drop.

00:51:59.690 --> 00:52:00.780
But oh, no.

00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:02.580
Completely the reverse happened.

00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:05.400
It rocketed through the
'60s, through the '70s,

00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:08.262
through the '80s, to the
point at which criminologists

00:52:08.262 --> 00:52:10.470
collectively said to
themselves, you know, it's never

00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:12.240
really going to stop, is it?

00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:15.270
It's just going to
go on and on and on.

00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:19.750
I mean, it may slow, but
then it started to drop--

00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:21.570
and drop, seemingly, hugely.

00:52:21.570 --> 00:52:23.550
So we're just as bad it seems--

00:52:23.550 --> 00:52:26.190
probably because some of
us are economists-- no--

00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:28.450
just as bad at spotting trends.

00:52:28.450 --> 00:52:30.540
But the thing with the
drop here, I think,

00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:33.870
is it's just possible
that we're measuring

00:52:33.870 --> 00:52:35.850
the wrong things now--

00:52:35.850 --> 00:52:37.760
that crime has changed.

00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:41.250
We briefly touched on
it at the beginning.

00:52:41.250 --> 00:52:43.830
The big thing here, and I'm
standing in the right place,

00:52:43.830 --> 00:52:46.250
I guess, is the internet.

00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:48.170
Young people's
behaviors have changed,

00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:50.610
and much crime has changed.

00:52:50.610 --> 00:52:54.720
Now, there's an awful, awful
lot of fraud, for example,

00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:57.700
but a whole variety
of other ICT,

00:52:57.700 --> 00:53:05.670
internet-based forms of criminal
or related activities I think

00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:09.120
are now done out of the
sight of the criminal justice

00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:11.070
agencies that have
traditionally been

00:53:11.070 --> 00:53:15.190
responsible for intervening
in these things.

00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:17.508
So the Crime Survey
for England and Wales,

00:53:17.508 --> 00:53:19.800
just to try to play catch up
with a little bit of this,

00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:22.170
is now starting to
try to measure things

00:53:22.170 --> 00:53:25.300
like internet-based crime
and fraud and so forth.

00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:27.660
And just doing that,
and nothing more,

00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:30.720
doubles the level of
crime that it's measuring.

00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:34.200
So if crime is going down,
it's going down much less

00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:35.683
than we thought.

00:53:35.683 --> 00:53:37.350
And at the very least,
I think, probably

00:53:37.350 --> 00:53:39.892
we need to think very carefully
about whether it's going down

00:53:39.892 --> 00:53:40.522
at all.

00:53:40.522 --> 00:53:42.480
I have overstayed my
welcome, so I should stop.

00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:43.620
Thank you very much indeed.

00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:47.071
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:54.090
SPEAKER: Tim, thank you.

00:53:54.090 --> 00:53:55.012
Brilliant talk.

00:53:55.012 --> 00:53:56.970
We've got time for,
definitely, a few questions

00:53:56.970 --> 00:53:57.875
if there are some.

00:53:57.875 --> 00:53:59.250
AUDIENCE: Would
society be better

00:53:59.250 --> 00:54:00.417
if all drugs were legalized?

00:54:00.417 --> 00:54:03.522
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:04.930 --> 00:54:07.577
TIM NEWBURN: That's
a great question.

00:54:07.577 --> 00:54:09.160
Take a drink while
I think about that.

00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:12.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:12.790 --> 00:54:15.550
Well, I'm not sure
about legalized.

00:54:15.550 --> 00:54:17.170
I suspect we might
be a lot better off

00:54:17.170 --> 00:54:20.145
if they were decriminalized.

00:54:20.145 --> 00:54:22.270
It's probably going to be
the same thing, isn't it?

00:54:22.270 --> 00:54:31.220
I mean, clearly the war
on drugs has failed,

00:54:31.220 --> 00:54:34.510
and the collateral consequences
of the war on drugs

00:54:34.510 --> 00:54:37.090
are extraordinary.

00:54:37.090 --> 00:54:42.460
So we live in a time where
some radical rethinking

00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:47.960
of how we deal with illicit
substances is required.

00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:53.630
There are some signs that we're
beginning to do some of that,

00:54:53.630 --> 00:54:58.330
but I don't think that we've
come close to thinking through,

00:54:58.330 --> 00:55:02.560
as it were, what the most
appropriate forms of regulation

00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:03.970
are--

00:55:03.970 --> 00:55:06.490
more particularly, what
the role of the state

00:55:06.490 --> 00:55:10.730
should be in that
regulatory process.

00:55:10.730 --> 00:55:15.220
But certainly it's the
best example, in some ways,

00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:23.380
of the failure of the
conceit to imagine

00:55:23.380 --> 00:55:28.640
that the solution to
crime is criminal justice.

00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:31.870
The solutions to crime to
the extent that they exist

00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:35.260
lie elsewhere.

00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:39.370
The issues with illicit
substances, I think,

00:55:39.370 --> 00:55:47.010
are to be found in public health
rather than criminal justice,

00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:50.130
which is only a partial
answer to your question,

00:55:50.130 --> 00:55:51.930
though, whether society
will be better off.

00:55:56.220 --> 00:55:58.053
AUDIENCE: I may be a
little bit biased here,

00:55:58.053 --> 00:56:00.080
but you mentioned that
crime may not have fallen

00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:02.122
and it may have gone on
to kind of tech platforms

00:56:02.122 --> 00:56:03.350
and that sort of thing.

00:56:03.350 --> 00:56:05.400
Bearing in mind it was
around the mid '90s

00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:09.720
when crime started falling,
is there a possibility

00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:13.050
that technology actually was
a major factor in the drop

00:56:13.050 --> 00:56:15.030
in crime in terms of
ability for police

00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:17.610
to share information,
ability for individuals

00:56:17.610 --> 00:56:20.490
to protect themselves
with things like CCTV,

00:56:20.490 --> 00:56:23.160
alarm systems in cars,
that type of thing?

00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:23.910
TIM NEWBURN: Yeah.

00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:29.610
I mean, it's absolutely
possible that technology--

00:56:29.610 --> 00:56:31.260
I mean, technology
is undoubtedly

00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:34.980
important in the
sharing of intelligence,

00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:40.660
in knowing what's going
on, in managing risk.

00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:43.430
It's also potentially, I think--

00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:47.940
one of the things that
I briefly mentioned,

00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:51.690
routine activities theory
earlier on, one of the things

00:56:51.690 --> 00:56:55.620
that is interested in
is the ways in which

00:56:55.620 --> 00:56:58.700
we organize our everyday lives.

00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:03.900
Now, I think that the
technological changes

00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:04.980
of the last--

00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:07.050
whatever-- 25 years
or so-- have probably

00:57:07.050 --> 00:57:10.530
had quite a dramatic impact
on the ways in-- well,

00:57:10.530 --> 00:57:12.780
they've undoubtedly have
had a dramatic impact

00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:16.530
on the ways in which young
people spend their time,

00:57:16.530 --> 00:57:19.270
organize their lives.

00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:21.420
Some of that may be
negative, but some of that

00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:22.680
actually may be very positive.

00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:26.320
That is, they-- or it may
be mixed, which is to say,

00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:29.820
I think that in some ways,
one of the consequences

00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:36.750
of technological change will be
to lead young people to spend

00:57:36.750 --> 00:57:39.000
their time in activities
which keep them away

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:42.390
from some of the criminal
opportunities that previously

00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:45.840
might have been more
significant in their lives.

00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:47.100
So absolutely.

00:57:47.100 --> 00:57:50.180
I think it can be both.

00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:53.470
AUDIENCE: You said
that maybe crime isn't

00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:56.000
falling as fast as we think.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.570
How do you explain
the current situation

00:57:58.570 --> 00:58:02.200
with the increase in
knife crime in London?

00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:04.690
Specifically, in the
last sort of six months

00:58:04.690 --> 00:58:07.030
I feel like it's become a
lot more prevalent, or maybe

00:58:07.030 --> 00:58:09.460
that's just
sensationalism, or is there

00:58:09.460 --> 00:58:12.840
a more deeper sort
of social reasoning

00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:14.760
why this has sort of increased?

00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:16.760
TIM NEWBURN: Well, your
question's a great one,

00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:19.840
but also the phrasing, which
you recognized, I think,

00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:24.110
gives something away
because you said I feel.

00:58:24.110 --> 00:58:27.100
The reality with
crime trends, I think,

00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:31.210
is we always have to look in the
medium or long term if we can.

00:58:31.210 --> 00:58:36.610
So the short term changes are
often very misleading, I think.

00:58:36.610 --> 00:58:42.790
One of the reasons that we
feel knife crime is increasing

00:58:42.790 --> 00:58:45.652
is because of how much
it's being talked about.

00:58:45.652 --> 00:58:47.110
And on one level,
of course, that's

00:58:47.110 --> 00:58:50.560
very positive because
it might indicate

00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:54.083
that people are taking something
that is serious, seriously.

00:58:54.083 --> 00:58:55.750
But if you look at
the long-term trends,

00:58:55.750 --> 00:59:00.350
or the medium-term trends-- so
the last few years in London--

00:59:00.350 --> 00:59:03.860
actually, knife crime's
relatively stable.

00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:08.698
I would say there have
been some recent increases,

00:59:08.698 --> 00:59:11.240
but none of that's to suggest
we shouldn't take it seriously.

00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:12.740
I think there are,
then, two things.

00:59:12.740 --> 00:59:15.700
I mean, one question
would be a political one.

00:59:15.700 --> 00:59:18.160
Why the fuss now?

00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:20.890
Why knife crime
becoming so newsworthy?

00:59:20.890 --> 00:59:24.760
Well, variety of reasons, but
you couldn't discount the fact

00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:26.410
that there's a big--

00:59:26.410 --> 00:59:28.360
with a small p--
political campaign

00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:30.790
around police
financing and numbers

00:59:30.790 --> 00:59:35.410
at the moment for a
variety of reasons.

00:59:35.410 --> 00:59:38.060
And that would have to be
taken into account, I think.

00:59:38.060 --> 00:59:40.210
But the other thing
that's going on there

00:59:40.210 --> 00:59:44.740
is that I think at least
some people would argue

00:59:44.740 --> 00:59:48.100
that if what seems to
be a short-term increase

00:59:48.100 --> 00:59:50.920
turns out to be a more sustained
long-term or medium-term

00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:54.010
increase in knife crime, then
that potentially tells us

00:59:54.010 --> 00:59:59.350
something about the nature
of the lives of young males,

00:59:59.350 --> 01:00:03.520
often young black men, in
some of the worst parts,

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:05.980
poorest parts of our
cities, and what's

01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:08.830
been happening in their
lives over the last half

01:00:08.830 --> 01:00:09.772
decade or more.

01:00:14.335 --> 01:00:14.960
SPEAKER: Great.

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:16.502
Tim, thank you so
much for coming in.

01:00:16.502 --> 01:00:18.000
TIM NEWBURN: Pleasure.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.350
