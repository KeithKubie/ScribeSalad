00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.400
[Captions by Judy V. at Y Translator]
In today's video,
we are revisiting experiment

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.240
where we tried breaking
a vacuum chamber underwater.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.819
We're going to do that again,
but with a few twists varieties

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:09.180
that should make it even cooler.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:17.040
[Music]

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.940
Not too long ago, we had an
experiment where we learned

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.380
what would happen if you had
a vacuum inside a glass bottle,

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.699
and then shattered
that bottle underwater.

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:26.550
I thought that experiment
looked really cool,

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.470
and I said that I
wanted to revisit it,

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.810
maybe scaling it up.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.800
There are some varieties
that I really want to try,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.340
and this is because
I thought that looks so cool

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.000
that I needed more footage of it,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.420
and so we now have
a flat walled aquarium,

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.140
and I've got eight different bottles,

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.170
and we're going to try
a few different things.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.700
We're going to put
some stuff in the bottles

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.380
before we pull a vacuum,

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.320
then close them off,

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.520
and then break them underwater,

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.700
and see what happens.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.240
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.500
A small piece of rubber will work
as a stopper over a glass bottle.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.500
We'll pull all of the air out
of the bottle in a vacuum chamber.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.579
We'll fill some of our bottles
with a variety of different materials,

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.930
and see how they look
when they break underwater,

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.400
especially in slow motion.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.480
As a sort of comparison shot,
we'll start with a plain empty bottle

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.490
with a vacuum inside,

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.680
and see how that looks.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:16.680
[Music]

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.960
Similar to last time,

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.060
we are going to start with one
miniature marshmallows in our jar,

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.060
and that's just to
give us a visual representation

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.040
of whether or not we've got
a good vacuum pulled in the glass.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.280
As you probably know,
if there is a good vacuum,

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.120
that marshmallow will
be puffed up quite a bit.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.920
[Music]

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.780
The marshmallow seems
to have stuck to the bottle

00:01:35.781 --> 00:01:37.650
from a little bit
of residual moisture,

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.820
but it shouldn't affect anything.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:52.320
[Music]

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.400
3, 2, 1.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.120
[Music]

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.000
That's interesting.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.520
It actually cracked the first time.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.840
The glass was damaged
but holding itself together.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.810
That's so weird.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.680
Like you can feel everything
gets sucked in a little bit,

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.480
and it sounds just like...

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.520
[Music]

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.780
We tried putting one
marshmallow in the bottle.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.439
Now, let's see what happens
if we fill it quite a bit.

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:19.389
The marshmallows will
expand in the vacuum.

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:23.180
So hopefully, they'll kind of fill
the whole bottle before it shatters.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:32.629
[Music]

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:35.950
Some of the marshmallows down
near the bottom got big fast

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.010
enough that they sort of
plugged everything up,

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.559
so the lower marshmallows
don't have any space to expand.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.260
You can see how big
the marshmallows at the top are.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.800
Okay, we've got a jar of
partially inflated marshmallows,

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:50.020
because they inflated so much
that they started deflating again.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:59.460
[Music]

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.820
It's cool to see this one in slow mo

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.920
because as I saw the result,

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.280
I wasn't quite sure how
all of the marshmallows

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.920
ended up in that one corner.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.359
Next up, we're going to try
some neon blue food coloring.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.840
We're just pour all
of it into the bottle,

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.580
and we'll see what happens
to it when we pull a vacuum.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.680
But it's not going
to completely turn into gas,

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:20.959
so we should still have
really low pressure in there.

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:21.999
Let's find out.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.500
[Music]

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.020
The super low pressure is
causing our food coloring to

00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:34.370
start bubbling a little bit.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.840
No, now, it's causing
it to bubble quite a bit.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.159
Bubbling and splattering all over though.

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:40.159
It's kind of neat.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.420
All right, I think that
means we're at a good vacuum.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.060
Let's pressure back in.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.400
Maximum effect.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.400
I'm going to try and coat this
whole bottle in our food coloring.

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:52.180
Just looks like blue glass now.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.740
[Music]

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:57.660
That's awesome!

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.860
[Music]

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.560
That was really impressive watching how
fast and far that blue coloring spread.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.720
It was almost instant
that the whole tank was blue.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.579
Looking at it at super high
speed, of course, I can see

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:13.979
that it wasn't actually instant,

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:15.620
but it felt that way
when I was doing it.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.753
[Music]

00:04:17.753 --> 00:04:19.930
I really liked how the bottle
with the food coloring in it went,

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.640
so now, I want to try using
this super neon green ink.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.060
[Music]

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.320
That's delightful.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:35.300
[Music]

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.920
It sinks instead of floating.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.140
Is not as much floating.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.660
[Music]

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.639
Not many things that I've
put in a vacuum chamber

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.920
have expanded more than whipped cream.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.760
So now we're going to try
putting a little bit of that

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.300
in one of the bottles,
see what it does.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.240
[Music]

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.240
I'm a healthy person.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.200
Whipping cream in a vacuum bottle.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:05.620
[Music]

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.900
I actually want to stop it
before it goes too far

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:11.260
because we have tested,
and you can unwhip cream

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.020
by pulling too much of a vacuum.

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.020
So, we're just going to
leave it nice and expanded.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:30.320
[Music]

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.051
What might happen if we
have something in the bottle

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.300
that reacts with the water itself?

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.520
We're going to try using
a little bit of baking soda,

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.360
and a little bit of citric acid.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.060
When they're both dry,
they aren't going to react,

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.440
but as soon as water hits them,
we should have quite a good fizz.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.020
1, 2, 3.

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.060
[Music]

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.400
Because we're watching
it at such slow frame rate,

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.499
it's fun to see the glass shatters,

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.300
the water flies into the vacuum,

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.000
fills it up,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.860
the bottom starts dropping off,

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.660
and then, kind of right
when you think like,

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:02.520
"Oh, it's over,"

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.020
that's when it starts reacting
with the chemicals inside the glass,

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.660
and you get a second burst of fizziness.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.500
Now, in this bottle, we've got
five different colors of sand,

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.700
layered on top of one another.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.220
The sand of course is just a powder,

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.500
and isn't going to react
in the vacuum chamber,

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.740
but I'm really hoping
we have like a cool spray.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.680
Like when the water goes rushing
into that depressurized bottle,

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:27.140
it all just like fly in there,

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:28.500
and they'll have
colors going everywhere.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.740
3, 2, 1.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:44.460
[Music]

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.020
That is some really fun footage.

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.900
I love watching those in slow motion.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.999
I like we got several different results.

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:53.189
We had some of them where the
bottle got cracked all the way through.

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:55.090
We had somewhere just
cracked part of the way,

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.280
and we just had these fun explosions.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.760
Water just flying around.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.900
Colors, sand, whipped cream.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.660
Overall, I really enjoy doing this.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.940
If there's anything you would
like to see us try inside a vacuum bottle,

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.120
breaking it underwater,
let us know down in the comments.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.020
Guys, that's not all there is.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.099
We've got more for you to see.

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:16.039
That box up at the top will
transport you directly to our last video,

00:07:16.039 --> 00:07:17.039
and you should go check it out.

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:18.800
The box at the bottom will
show you what YouTube thinks

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.090
you need to be watching next,

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.300
and this bomb here in the middle
will subscribe you to the channel,

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.380
that way, you never miss out on a video.

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.199
Don't forget to ring that bell,
and we'll see you in the next one.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.080
Talk to you then.
