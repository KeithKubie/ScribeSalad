00:00:00.288 --> 00:00:01.277
- [Instructor] A senator wanted to know

00:00:01.277 --> 00:00:02.740
about how people in her state

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.108
felt about internet privacy issues.

00:00:05.108 --> 00:00:07.309
She conducted a poll by calling 100 people

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:10.360
whose names were randomly
sampled from the phone book.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.729
Note that mobile phones
and unlisted numbers

00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:15.056
are not in phone books.

00:00:15.056 --> 00:00:17.410
The senator's office called those numbers

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.395
until they got a response
from all 100 people chosen.

00:00:21.395 --> 00:00:23.679
The poll showed that 42% of respondents

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:27.385
were very concerned
about internet privacy.

00:00:27.385 --> 00:00:29.378
What is the most concerning

00:00:29.378 --> 00:00:31.244
source of bias in this scenario?

00:00:31.244 --> 00:00:32.457
And we should also think about,

00:00:32.457 --> 00:00:35.522
well what kind of bias
does that likely introduce?

00:00:35.522 --> 00:00:38.601
Is this likely to be an
overestimate or an underestimate

00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:40.000
of the number of respondents?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.616
And maybe there's no bias here.

00:00:41.616 --> 00:00:43.107
But our choices,

00:00:43.107 --> 00:00:45.810
and no bias is not one of
the choices you can imagine,

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.498
it's gonna be one of these three.

00:00:48.498 --> 00:00:49.947
So, I encourage you to pause this video

00:00:49.947 --> 00:00:51.229
and think about what we just said.

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:52.650
Where we're a senator,

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.183
we're trying to figure out what percentage

00:00:54.183 --> 00:00:56.008
of our response, of our constituents,

00:00:56.008 --> 00:00:58.418
are very concerned about internet privacy.

00:00:58.418 --> 00:01:00.410
And we go to the phone
book, we sample 100 people.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.403
We keep calling them until they answer,

00:01:02.403 --> 00:01:05.273
and we get that 42% are very concerned.

00:01:05.273 --> 00:01:08.101
So what's the source of bias?

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:11.124
Alright, now let's work
through this together.

00:01:11.124 --> 00:01:14.231
So nonresponse is, would've been the case,

00:01:14.231 --> 00:01:16.516
if we selected these 100 people,

00:01:16.516 --> 00:01:18.550
and let's say only 50
people answered the phone

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.124
and we didn't keep calling them.

00:01:20.124 --> 00:01:23.440
Then we'd say, well 50 of
the people who we sampled

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.725
to answer our survey didn't even respond.

00:01:25.725 --> 00:01:27.048
There was a nonresponse there,

00:01:27.048 --> 00:01:28.832
what was there about those 50 people?

00:01:28.832 --> 00:01:30.448
Maybe there was something that
would've skewed the survey

00:01:30.448 --> 00:01:32.259
or actually if we, had we gotten them,

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.390
it would've gotten maybe get better data.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.508
But in this case, they tell us,

00:01:36.508 --> 00:01:38.751
the senator's office called those numbers

00:01:38.751 --> 00:01:41.273
until they got a response
from all 100 people chosen.

00:01:41.273 --> 00:01:42.945
So the 100 people that they chose,

00:01:42.945 --> 00:01:44.770
they made sure they got a response.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.197
So nonresponse is not
going to be an issue here.

00:01:48.197 --> 00:01:50.733
Alright, next choice, undercoverage.

00:01:50.733 --> 00:01:52.432
Well undercoverage is
where you're not able

00:01:52.432 --> 00:01:55.177
to sample from part of the population.

00:01:55.177 --> 00:01:57.949
And a part of the population
that actually might,

00:01:57.949 --> 00:01:59.858
because you didn't sample it,

00:01:59.858 --> 00:02:01.516
it might introduce bias.

00:02:01.516 --> 00:02:03.717
Now let's think about what
happened in this situation.

00:02:03.717 --> 00:02:05.877
We are a senator.

00:02:05.877 --> 00:02:08.621
We want to sample all of our constituents,

00:02:08.621 --> 00:02:11.031
but we choose, we instead we sample

00:02:11.031 --> 00:02:11.895
from the constituents

00:02:11.895 --> 00:02:14.305
who happen to be listed in the phone book.

00:02:14.305 --> 00:02:17.203
So these are the people who happen to be

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:19.286
listed in the phone book.

00:02:21.202 --> 00:02:23.821
And so we're not sampling from people

00:02:23.821 --> 00:02:25.521
who are not in the phone book,

00:02:25.521 --> 00:02:28.224
who maybe have landlines
and they're unlisted.

00:02:28.224 --> 00:02:30.035
And we're not sampling from people

00:02:30.035 --> 00:02:33.281
who don't have landlines,
who only have mobile phones.

00:02:33.281 --> 00:02:35.301
And you might say, well
why is that important?

00:02:35.301 --> 00:02:36.137
Well think about it,

00:02:36.137 --> 00:02:39.871
people who decide not to
list in the phone book

00:02:39.871 --> 00:02:41.612
or people who don't even have a landline,

00:02:41.612 --> 00:02:43.409
some of those people might be
a little bit more concerned

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:45.095
about privacy than everyone else.

00:02:45.095 --> 00:02:47.923
They explicitly chose not to be listed.

00:02:47.923 --> 00:02:51.239
So undercoverage is
definitely a very concerning

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.301
source of bias over here.

00:02:53.301 --> 00:02:55.962
We are sampling from only a subset

00:02:55.962 --> 00:02:58.163
of our entire population we care about.

00:02:58.163 --> 00:02:59.905
In particular, we're missing out on people

00:02:59.905 --> 00:03:01.939
who might care about privacy.

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:04.057
And so I would say
because of undercoverage,

00:03:04.057 --> 00:03:07.094
42% is likely to be an underestimate

00:03:07.094 --> 00:03:09.337
of the people concerned
about internet privacy.

00:03:09.337 --> 00:03:11.649
Probably a higher proportion
of the people out here

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:13.182
care about privacy,
because they're unlisted

00:03:13.182 --> 00:03:15.091
or they don't even have a landline.

00:03:15.091 --> 00:03:18.295
So, undercoverage, it
probably introduced bias,

00:03:18.295 --> 00:03:22.295
and it implies that
42% is an underestimate

00:03:25.568 --> 00:03:28.173
of the percentage of the
senator's constituents

00:03:28.173 --> 00:03:30.458
who care about internet privacy.

00:03:30.458 --> 00:03:34.625
Now the last question,
volunteer response sampling.

00:03:36.894 --> 00:03:38.148
Well this would be the case where you,

00:03:38.148 --> 00:03:39.681
you know the senator, I don't know,

00:03:39.681 --> 00:03:42.425
put a billboard out or just told someone,

00:03:42.425 --> 00:03:44.613
told a bunch of people,
maybe on her website,

00:03:44.613 --> 00:03:48.263
hey vote for this or
give us your information

00:03:48.263 --> 00:03:51.551
on how much you care
about internet privacy.

00:03:51.551 --> 00:03:54.992
And that would've been,
the source of bias there,

00:03:54.992 --> 00:03:56.586
is well who shows up on that website?

00:03:56.586 --> 00:03:57.721
Once again, if you did,

00:03:57.721 --> 00:04:00.006
hey come to my website and fill it out,

00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:03.531
you're only getting
information from a subset

00:04:03.531 --> 00:04:05.899
of your population who are choosing,

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:07.473
who are volunteering.

00:04:07.473 --> 00:04:10.162
That is not the situation
that she did over here.

00:04:10.162 --> 00:04:12.698
She didn't ask 100 people to volunteer.

00:04:12.698 --> 00:04:16.432
Her team went out and got
them from the phone book.

00:04:16.432 --> 00:04:19.873
So this was definitely
a case of undercoverage.
