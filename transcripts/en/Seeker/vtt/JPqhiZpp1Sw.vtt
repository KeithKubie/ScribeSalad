00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.270
Books, stamps, beanie babies, movie tickets,
why do people collect things?

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.410
What’s the point?

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.980
Hey collectors, Julia here for DNews.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.490
In today’s world downsizing is big.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.849
Getting rid of clutter is trendy and people
are learning to live with less.

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:21.769
Yet there will always be that one person you
know who collects things.

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:25.990
Like Sheli McHugh on twitter who collects
sheep things or my friend Chastity who has

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.509
kept tickets from every movie she’s been
to since 1997.

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:31.749
So why do people do it?

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:34.390
I turned to twitter for some personal answers.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.900
People have all sorts of reasons.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.700
For some collecting is a way to bond with
people, like &rlm;Bruivision collected coins

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.560
as a hobby to share with her dad.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.670
Moiety Mouse said they collect rocks out of
curiosity about the world around them.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:46.670
DR.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.420
Zen collects key chains because s/he enjoys
the “thrill of the hunt.”

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.420
People like this aren’t just weird pack
rats.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.500
They’re just fulfilling a natural urge.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.060
The urge to collect is very primitive and
is found throughout the animal kingdom.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.830
Over 70 species have been documented to collect.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.720
Rats and crows.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.370
The bowerbird of Eastern Australia and Queensland
collects unusual objects as part of an elaborate

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.370
courtship ritual.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.220
So some researchers think collecting goes
back to early days as humans.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.750
For our hunter-gather ancestors, collecting
food could mean the difference between life

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.960
and death during a harsh growing season or
famine.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.390
So it’s not surprising this trait evolved.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.210
But collecting beanies won’t help you survive
a winter.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.700
(sorry 90s kids, they’re pretty worthless,
unless it’s a rare princess Di bear.)

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.560
So what’s going on in the brain?

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.080
Like Dr. Zen said, it’s the thrill of the
hunt.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.479
When you find that thing, that rare baseball
card your brain releases a hit of dopamine.

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.780
That tells your brain “yeah this is good,
do it again”.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.540
This probably helped our ancestors find food.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.340
Finding some ripe berries made their brains
go, “yup awesome, these will keep us alive,

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.100
do it again” but after a while the brain
gets used to it and doesn’t release as much

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.310
dopamine the next time they found those berries.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.600
So you keep seeking.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.830
Keep hunting for that next thrill.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.790
While that kept our ancestors alive.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.170
It keeps us seeking and collecting.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.550
Research published in the journal Brain found
the specific area of the brain responsible

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:01.900
for collecting behavior.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.580
The researchers identified 13 patients with
focal brain lesions who exhibited abnormal

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.039
collecting behavior but performed fine on
tests of intelligence, memory, and reasoning.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.800
These patients showed no signs of abnormal
collecting before the brain damage.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.480
After using high resolution 3D MRI, the researchers
found the culprit.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.150
It turns out that the brain was damaged in
a very specific place, in “a part of the

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.640
frontal lobes of the cortex, particularly
on the right side”.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.420
Speaking of abnormal collecting behavior,
are you having trouble letting go of your

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.420
collection?

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.420
That’s not so unusual.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.959
In fact it’s pretty biological.

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.340
Dr. Loretta G Breuning, founder of the Inner
Mammal Institute describes an experiment where

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.150
monkeys were given spinach as a reward for
a task.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.450
Which, ya know they liked.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.709
But when they were given a grape, their dopamine
levels spiked.

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.010
After a while of getting that grape as a reward,
their brains stopped spiking with as much

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.010
dopamine.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.190
So it stopped feeling as good.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.580
Then the researchers switched back to spinach
and the monkeys were NOT HAPPY.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.580
AT ALL.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.959
They missed the grapes, even if they stopped
feeling as good.

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.700
So for most of us it’s perfectly natural
to not feel good about letting things go.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.980
But sometimes, it’s a problem.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.370
Another study published in the journal Archives
of General Psychiatry, using MRI techniques,

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.030
found that patients with hoarding disorder
have abnormal activity in the anterior cingulate

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.540
cortex (ACC) and insula.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.500
They had lower activity than other people
when faced with the idea of giving away stuff

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.660
that didn’t belong to them, but more activity
when faced with the thought of giving away

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:22.660
their own stuff.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.880
The patients reported indecisiveness, and
feeling like things were "not just right".

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.160
Another study published in the journal American
Journal of Psychiatry, found that people who

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.730
hoard showed decreased brain activity in the
posterior cingulate gyrus.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.550
An area involved in spatial orientation and
memory.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.440
This could be why some people who hoard have
problems with clutter and fear of losing their

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.709
things, maybe their stuff is associated with
a memory..

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.319
So some collecting, natural and benefited
us back in the day.

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:51.110
A lot of collecting and keeping… well they
make whole shows about that.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.650
To see first hand how enthusiastic some people
get about their collection, check out this

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:06.970
great episode from Seeker Stories all about
a group of 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:21.690
people who collect sneakers.
