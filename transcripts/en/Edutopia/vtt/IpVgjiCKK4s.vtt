00:00:00.086 --> 00:00:02.576
&gt;&gt;Student: These beekeeper
hats are so annoying.

00:00:03.456 --> 00:00:05.746
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Put some wood in there
now and I think we're ready to go.

00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.626
Can you tell me what
you see on that frame?

00:00:08.786 --> 00:00:10.176
&gt;&gt;Student: I think I
see nectar right there.

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:11.966
&gt;&gt;Student: Ooh, there's
honey, there's honey!

00:00:12.056 --> 00:00:13.486
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Because of science literacy,

00:00:13.646 --> 00:00:17.396
our students are active
learners who ask questions.

00:00:17.806 --> 00:00:19.306
They have a sense of curiosity.

00:00:19.576 --> 00:00:21.976
They're able to take that curiosity
and go do something with it.

00:00:23.346 --> 00:00:23.916
&gt;&gt;Student: Is that larva?

00:00:25.106 --> 00:00:25.976
&gt;&gt;Student: Those are definitely larva.

00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:37.456
&gt;&gt;Mark: At Birmingham
Covington, we pride ourselves

00:00:37.456 --> 00:00:39.026
on interdisciplinary learning.

00:00:39.096 --> 00:00:41.746
&gt;&gt;Student: These are responsible
for fruits and vegetables.

00:00:42.056 --> 00:00:46.916
&gt;&gt;Mark: Teachers wanted to collaborate
to blend expertise in content,

00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:51.476
so we developed the science literacy
to give teachers time to collaborate

00:00:51.476 --> 00:00:56.016
with each other and with kids,
to identify a problem and go out

00:00:56.016 --> 00:00:58.266
and figure out how to solve it.

00:00:58.266 --> 00:00:59.846
&gt;&gt;Tammy: Let's talk about
the plan for the day.

00:01:00.116 --> 00:01:03.736
&gt;&gt;The students found an article that
talked about honey bees possibly going

00:01:03.736 --> 00:01:06.716
into extinction, and they said,
"We should do something with this."

00:01:07.096 --> 00:01:10.886
&gt;&gt;So Mrs. Roberts, she is going to
work with all of the research teams.

00:01:11.216 --> 00:01:13.316
I'm going to come work with
the presentation teams.

00:01:13.956 --> 00:01:16.796
&gt;&gt;Pauline: Two teachers spend the
afternoon with fifty-four students,

00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:18.866
totally blending their curriculum.

00:01:19.126 --> 00:01:20.156
&gt;&gt;Tammy: So we'll have our honey--

00:01:20.296 --> 00:01:22.666
&gt;&gt;So my expertise would
be the science area

00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:25.166
and my teaching partner,
she is in language arts.

00:01:25.516 --> 00:01:27.436
&gt;&gt;Pauline: You guys are
the research team.

00:01:27.716 --> 00:01:29.476
What's our responsibilities
as a researcher?

00:01:29.476 --> 00:01:29.776
Yes.

00:01:29.776 --> 00:01:33.726
&gt;&gt;Student: You need to like, figure
out if it's a reliable source or not.

00:01:34.216 --> 00:01:36.736
&gt;&gt;Pauline: The research team
provides the knowledge and the content

00:01:36.976 --> 00:01:39.426
for the other groups
to take action upon.

00:01:39.426 --> 00:01:42.976
&gt;&gt;Each group of you has got a different
article that you're going to read.

00:01:42.976 --> 00:01:48.336
&gt;&gt;Max: Our article explained North
Carolina being sprayed for mosquitoes

00:01:48.336 --> 00:01:51.876
with the Zika virus, but it killed
off two million different honey bees.

00:01:52.026 --> 00:01:54.716
&gt;&gt;Pauline: The first thing that
we wanted them to do was pull

00:01:54.716 --> 00:01:58.566
out what they believed
to be the key facts.

00:01:58.566 --> 00:02:01.286
&gt;&gt;Student: The pesticide
hasn't been used for a while,

00:02:01.286 --> 00:02:02.156
so that's pretty important.

00:02:02.156 --> 00:02:04.116
&gt;&gt;Pauline: Then to think
about who's the author,

00:02:04.196 --> 00:02:06.506
what's the source, what
are the credentials?

00:02:06.806 --> 00:02:10.216
&gt;&gt;Student: The first paragraph
isn't really that important.

00:02:10.216 --> 00:02:14.206
&gt;&gt;Pauline: We want students to be
educated consumers of information.

00:02:14.206 --> 00:02:17.366
&gt;&gt;Tammy: You guys want to label
it spring, fall, summer, winter.

00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:20.686
&gt;&gt;On the other side of the room,
we had our action teams working.

00:02:20.826 --> 00:02:23.916
&gt;&gt;We want them to learn
while they're having fun.

00:02:23.916 --> 00:02:27.266
&gt;&gt;They're trying to figure out
a fun way to get people involved

00:02:27.266 --> 00:02:29.176
and bring awareness out to the public.

00:02:29.766 --> 00:02:33.426
Every student is on both a
research team and on an action team.

00:02:33.426 --> 00:02:35.766
&gt;&gt;Max: It helps to spread
out the workload,

00:02:35.766 --> 00:02:40.436
so that we can get more things
done, and inform the public easier.

00:02:40.436 --> 00:02:43.026
&gt;&gt;Student: We really do not want
the world to look like this.

00:02:43.486 --> 00:02:46.786
&gt;&gt;Tammy: We want them all to be
a part of, what could you do?

00:02:47.056 --> 00:02:48.636
And they have so many ideas.

00:02:49.726 --> 00:02:53.076
We have a product team working
on candle making and honey.

00:02:53.656 --> 00:02:56.706
And our garden team is making
what we call seed balls.

00:02:56.956 --> 00:03:00.596
They combine compost and clay
and seeds that are bee friendly.

00:03:00.946 --> 00:03:04.186
Just by planting flowers in your
yard, you're helping the bees.

00:03:04.726 --> 00:03:06.816
&gt;&gt;Max: We also have a
website that people can check

00:03:06.816 --> 00:03:09.156
out to inform themselves
about the honey bees.

00:03:09.566 --> 00:03:12.536
&gt;&gt;Tammy: The whole purpose is to
educate, so they also have a brochure.

00:03:12.786 --> 00:03:16.756
&gt;&gt;Gray: We want you and Ethan
to be working on new information

00:03:16.756 --> 00:03:18.616
that we could be put
on to our poster board.

00:03:19.066 --> 00:03:24.396
&gt;&gt;Gray: We're researching and then
putting it to use in presentations

00:03:24.396 --> 00:03:28.256
and posters, so we can
present it locally.

00:03:28.256 --> 00:03:32.236
&gt;&gt;Student: Because if bees did go
extinct, you'd be a little hungry.

00:03:33.276 --> 00:03:35.996
&gt;&gt;Tammy: They know that to be
credible, that they have to be

00:03:35.996 --> 00:03:37.226
as knowledgeable as they can.

00:03:38.836 --> 00:03:40.976
The kids said, "We have to have hives."

00:03:41.046 --> 00:03:41.976
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Okay, let's go have some fun.

00:03:43.526 --> 00:03:43.976
&gt;&gt;Students: Yeah.

00:03:45.076 --> 00:03:48.046
&gt;&gt;Tammy: We need to actually have
our own bees so that we're helping.

00:03:48.046 --> 00:03:49.806
&gt;&gt;Maggie: We are trying
to repopulate the bees

00:03:49.836 --> 00:03:51.976
in Michigan, because they are dying.

00:03:52.246 --> 00:03:53.256
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Shall we take a peek?

00:03:53.366 --> 00:03:55.316
&gt;&gt;Maggie: Yeah, let's do it.

00:03:55.636 --> 00:03:55.806
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Okay.

00:03:56.586 --> 00:03:57.936
&gt;&gt;Student: Okay, someone grab it.

00:03:58.046 --> 00:03:59.176
&gt;&gt;Maggie: We also want to
learn more about the bees.

00:03:59.176 --> 00:04:02.016
It helps me, because I can
see it and I believe it.

00:04:02.126 --> 00:04:03.156
&gt;&gt;Student: I got some brood.

00:04:03.416 --> 00:04:05.606
&gt;&gt;Tammy: The nice part about
our science literacy class is

00:04:05.606 --> 00:04:07.996
that the students get to
do anything they want.

00:04:08.416 --> 00:04:13.406
In science, I am bound by the
state objectives I have to teach.

00:04:13.486 --> 00:04:15.256
&gt;&gt;I actually see larva.

00:04:15.896 --> 00:04:19.756
&gt;&gt;Science literacy, there's
no state mandated curriculum.

00:04:20.056 --> 00:04:22.546
We didn't have to choose
a topic that was fifth

00:04:22.546 --> 00:04:24.346
or sixth grade curriculum related.

00:04:24.346 --> 00:04:27.646
That's more powerful, because the
students got to make those choices.

00:04:28.256 --> 00:04:30.276
&gt;&gt;Student: We have some larvae and eggs.

00:04:30.276 --> 00:04:35.356
&gt;&gt;Tammy: Our objective is that students
would be able to take the skills

00:04:35.356 --> 00:04:38.076
that they've learned in our class
and apply it to any problem.

00:04:38.076 --> 00:04:41.776
&gt;&gt;Pauline: Science literacy is
teaching our students to be curious

00:04:41.776 --> 00:04:43.326
about the world around them.

00:04:43.426 --> 00:04:45.176
With the problems they identify,

00:04:45.336 --> 00:04:48.596
they articulate how they
want the community to help.

00:04:48.596 --> 00:04:51.346
So even as students,
they are learning how

00:04:51.346 --> 00:04:53.566
to become effective agents of change.

00:04:54.786 --> 00:04:56.996
So it's bigger than just
the science content.

00:04:57.276 --> 00:04:59.866
It's about helping to
develop the citizens

00:05:00.126 --> 00:05:01.916
that we really hope our children become.

00:05:02.096 --> 00:05:03.436
&gt;&gt;Student: Whoa, this one's heavy.

00:05:03.766 --> 00:05:04.626
We got a lot.
