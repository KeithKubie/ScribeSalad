Great experiences on Android
TV are casual, cinematic,

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.540
and simple.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.380
You can lean back on
the couch and enjoy

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.550
hundreds of movies,
TV series, and videos

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:10.540
from various sources.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:11.720
But wait.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.230
How can you find
your favorite movie

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.590
amongst thousands of
movies in your library?

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.930
Well, the answer is that
you can just search for it.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.540
In fact, searching is something
that Android TV does really

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:21.500
well.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.060
I'm Wayne Piekarski, a
developer advocate at Google,

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.370
and today, I'm going to show you
how search works on Android TV

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.100
and how you can surface the
great content of your app

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.890
to your users.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.760
This here is the
Android TV home screen.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.030
Users can easily
access the Search menu

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.120
and ask for anything
using their own voice

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.360
or via keyboard input.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.710
The results are displayed
in a well organized form

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.440
and users have one click
access to launch the content.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.635
This is a really cool feature.

00:00:48.635 --> 00:00:50.510
So you might be worried
that your users won't

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.330
be able to find the content
contained within your app.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.650
The good news is that
Android TV search

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.740
enables your app to surface
its content outside of the app.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.060
Your users will be much
happier to easily find

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.099
what they're after, and in
turn, this will drive engagement

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:06.580
with your app.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.580
Let's quickly look
at how search works.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.280
Android TV will show the
search results from Google,

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.290
but it also queries locally
installed searchable apps

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.440
and combines these results.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.690
Building a searchable
app on Android TV

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.580
is just the same as building a
searchable app on other Android

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.760
phones and tablets, so you can
use exactly the same Android

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.446
tools as what you're
already familiar with.

00:01:27.446 --> 00:01:29.070
Let's talk about what
some of the steps

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.120
are to go and make this happen.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.690
First, you have to let
Android framework know

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.800
that your app is searchable.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.990
This is done by adding an
XML file with some metadata

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.550
in an XML resources
folder, like this one here.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.150
So what does this file
look like, exactly?

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.320
Label is the name
of your app and it

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.000
should be the same as the name
applied to the Android label

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.650
attribute of your activity or
application manifest element.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.180
This label is used to
identify your application

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.240
when providing search
results and to categorize it.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.730
The search suggest authority
uniquely identifies

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.130
your content provider.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.770
Therefore, this value must
match the authority string

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.470
provided in the
Android authorities

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.510
attribute of the AndroidManifest
provider element.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.240
And search suggest intent
action is the default intent

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.070
action to be used when a user
clicks on a search result.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.220
Mainly, this is a view
intent that we use here.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.960
This IS a deep
link into your app

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.040
and should go straight
to the selected content.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.970
Finally, since we want to
surface our results globally,

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.100
we need to set the include
global search attribute

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.610
value to true.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.004
For more detailed information
of other attributes,

00:02:39.004 --> 00:02:41.420
you can always refer to this
link in the Android developer

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.720
documentation.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.030
Next, you need to define
a content provider

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.780
for the search results in
the AndroidManifest XML file.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.980
As I mentioned earlier,
the content provider

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.100
should have the exact
same authority string

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.420
provided in search
suggest authority,

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.180
and it has to be
allowed to access

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.539
this provider from other apps.

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:02.580
The actual implementation
of the content provider

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.560
depends on you, and you can
find a step by step guide

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.950
for building a provider at
the Android developer site.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.840
However, today, I've
got some tips for you

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.094
to help implementing a
search result provider.

00:03:14.094 --> 00:03:16.260
Since the main purpose of
the search result provider

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.820
is providing search
results, you don't

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.410
need to implement methods
like insert or update, just

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.310
the query method.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.980
All the necessary
constant strings

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.879
like URI path and
columns which you

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:29.295
might need to
implement a provider

00:03:29.295 --> 00:03:32.386
are already defined in
the search manager class.

00:03:32.386 --> 00:03:35.300
Some results, for example,
are RESULT_CARD_IMAGE, image,

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.900
which is used for
defining an image, poster,

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.800
or cover of your media,
CONTENT_TYPE for your media's

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.830
MIME type, and DURATION,
which includes time

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.350
information in milliseconds.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.190
You can also define what
data should be passed back

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.690
to your app when a user
clicks on a search result

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.920
by setting an intent data
column value or a combination

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.500
of intent data ID
and a search suggest

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.400
intent data attribute in the
previous searchable element.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.440
Therefore, in the
query method, you

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.060
should gather result data
from your data source

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.390
based on the query
string and then

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.940
map that data into the cursor
by using the pre-defined column

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.280
names.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.220
The Android TV framework
will then take your cursor

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.740
and look it up using the same
column names that you used

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.390
and display nice looking
result cards using data

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.890
that you provide.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:24.820
And that's it.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.700
You can verify this
by installing your app

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.120
to the device, performing
a test query on Android TV,

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.870
and you find that the results
from your app are included.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.740
I also have a
special tip for you.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.030
If you've had the chance
to use Android TV devices,

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.720
you may have noticed this.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.940
As you see here, the search
result itself came from Google,

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.660
but when a user
clicks this button,

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.270
a specific app is
launched directly.

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.179
We call this a watch action
link, and with your app,

00:04:50.179 --> 00:04:51.970
you can take advantage
of this cool feature

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.180
and it's really easy to do.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.990
When you provide data
for search results

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.350
and return enough
metadata to identify

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.290
that the media from
your app matches

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.560
the results from
Google, then Android TV

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.190
will automatically attach
the watch action link

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.030
on the search result card.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.350
So keep this in mind.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.320
Try to provide rich and
accurate metadata for your media

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.550
to assist this process.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.190
And here's just one
last thing for you.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.940
If you would like to
provide in app search

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.930
functionality in your app,
this is really easy as well.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.550
Just override the on
search requested callback

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.600
in your TV activity and
the default search icon

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.480
will appear on the top of
your layout, like this.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.740
Whenever a user
selects the Search icon

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.110
or clicks the Search button
on the remote control,

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.420
your callback will be invoked.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.140
Inside the callback, you can
launch your own search result

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:42.980
activity, as shown
in this example here.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.000
To make your life easier,
the Leanback Support Library

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.820
provides a search
fragment widget

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.740
which implements a main layout
for the search results screen,

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.170
and you can find out
more detailed information

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:57.160
about the Leanback Library
in this previous Dev Byte.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.520
If you want to test the
concepts I just explained,

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.751
the code is available as a
sample at this link here.

00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:05.250
If you want to learn more about
other interesting Android TV

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.610
features like recommendations,
the background manager,

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.740
you should definitely check out
the Android TV documentation

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.160
at the Android
developers website.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.540
So that's it for today.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:16.840
I hope you enjoyed this video.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:17.710
I'm Wayne Piekarski.

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.120
Thanks for watching and
I'll see you next time.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.670
