00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.210
Now I'd like to show you a series of examples that basically best

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:10.060
showcase what the shutter speed does to a image that's captured on the sensor.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.090
Remember again,

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.230
the amount of time the sensor is exposed to the light is the way,

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.500
the best way to kind of see what's going to be registered on the sensor.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.510
Here we see an example of an image captured with a shutter speed of one second.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:31.210
Of course, what comes out of it is a whole lot of blurry streaks of the water.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.200
Here I'm showing you basically an image of a waterfall and

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.330
it's being exposed at different shutter speeds shown here.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.730
So it starts of with one second all the way to

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.090
different shutter speeds of one-third, one-thirtieth, one-two-hundredth.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.429
So this is one second, one-third, one-thirtieth, one-two-hundredth,

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:58.040
and one-eight-hundredth speed.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.220
So again, you can see the different details when this happens.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.160
We see, basically, water, and the water fountain becoming streaking.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.670
Or becoming much more crisper.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.710
So you can streaks of water, blurry water, and really crisp images there.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.510
So the amount of time the sensor is exposed to light is

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.189
basically what allows you to have these different effects.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.420
Usually these amounts are denoted by fractions of a second.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.020
We saw various examples.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.560
It could be 1/2000 would be a very fast shutter, or 1/1000.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.930
All the way to even how long you want to keep it open.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.880
You can actually keep a shutter open for 30 seconds.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.620
And sometimes most cameras, in fact,

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.960
have a version called bulb where basically if the shutter's open for

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.880
the exact time that you've actually pressed the shutter and released it.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.530
And basically now you kind of see how the effects of motion blur to streaks

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.720
are captured by a photographer who wants to control these types of parameters.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.260
Another way of looking at the same thing is here I'm basically showing an

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:03.340
example of a waterfall again at a faster shutter speed of 1/125th of a second.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.922
Of course when I go to a slower shutter speed,

00:02:05.922 --> 00:02:10.889
one-tenth of a second you can start seeing a lot more of the streaks.

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:12.380
And even more blurriness and

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.730
streak kind of shows here with one-half of a second.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.770
Another example, the same category.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.740
Still sharp of this thing, basically shows each and every petal.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.510
Very crisp, increase it and now I start seeing a little bit more.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.390
And of course I really have a much wider or

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.130
much more open shutter then you'll see everything blurring.
