1
00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:02.100
Okay.

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.780
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on it's Bill Burr.</v>

3
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.330
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

4
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.830
January 15th,
2018 what's going on?
How are you?

5
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.530
How are you?
Um,

6
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.960
I'm in San Francisco.
It's still Sunday.
Uh,

7
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.890
the second half has just begun.

8
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.080
The saints go marching in versus the a Minnesota Vikings.

9
00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:30.240
This saints was my pick this weekend.

10
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.600
I loved drew Brees going into Minnesota and fucking having everybody crying at

11
00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:39.420
the fucking mall of America by the end of the game.

12
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.110
And so far the vikings are up 17 did nothing.

13
00:00:43.111 --> 00:00:46.290
Although I think they just fucking went three and out.
Oh,

14
00:00:46.291 --> 00:00:50.100
case Kate just get put down on his fucking Keester.

15
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:52.423
<v 0>MMM.</v>

16
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.780
<v 1>We'll see.
We'll see.
You never know what's going to happen,
you know.
I mean,
look,</v>

17
00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.530
look at the fucking Jaguar's.
The Jaguar's when just came right out,

18
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.140
gave this stale is the old right there.
Fred,

19
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.090
all of a sudden they're running back twists his ankle.
Right?
I don't fear,

20
00:01:06.091 --> 00:01:09.670
I can't put any weight on it,
man.
Right?

21
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.690
Then all of a sudden the Steelers come roaring fucking back and I'm sitting

22
00:01:13.691 --> 00:01:18.130
there going,
this game's over
the Pittsburgh Steelers.
It's in Pittsburgh.

23
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.890
This shit is over.
No Way.
Uh,

24
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.830
what the fuck's his named Bryce portals?
I can't,
by the way,

25
00:01:26.831 --> 00:01:31.540
I can't keep up with these fucking names from the 90s okay.

26
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.890
The cases,
the Bryce,
the Boltons,
the fucking,
I don't know.
You know,

27
00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.640
a lot of comics had done bits about it,
but you know,
back when it was like,

28
00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:40.474
you know,

29
00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.400
Bill Bob fucking Steve Joe,

30
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.020
<v 0>yeah.</v>

31
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.640
<v 1>Greatest quarterback of all fucking time at one point was named Joe.
You know,</v>

32
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.420
Joe Nemeth,
Joe Montana,
Joe Theismann,
Joe

33
00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.870
fucking Blake Bortles,
I,
you know,

34
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.070
whatever.
I'm just,
I'm an old,
crabby fucking man.

35
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.960
I guess the nineties it was really big to name your kid after a CNA,

36
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.490
considering all the quarterbacks.
Right.
Kurt Carson case.

37
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:17.340
<v 0>Okay.</v>

38
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.010
<v 1>It's like,
did Roger Clemens Fuck all these women?
Yeah,</v>

39
00:02:22.011 --> 00:02:26.900
but he did that.
It had like fucking nine kids and he,
Cody,

40
00:02:26.901 --> 00:02:30.740
Kyle,
Cunty,
Chris,
right?
They're all case.

41
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.970
They were all Kay's.
Yeah.
Why would you have them have their own identity?

42
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.650
Let's fucking have their name be about your fucking career.
Um,

43
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.040
what do you mean you want to be a veterinarian?
Get the fuck out there.

44
00:02:43.041 --> 00:02:45.140
Pick up a baseball and throw some hay.

45
00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.000
<v 0>MMM,</v>

46
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.050
<v 1>sorry.
That was my impression of what it's like inside their households.</v>

47
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.430
Like I have any idea.
All right.

48
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.710
I have nothing against the Clemens family.
I love Roger Clemens.

49
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.970
You know,
fuck it.

50
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:04.480
Did some great things with the red sox before you went to Toronto.
Well,

51
00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:08.290
we let them go.
Right then.
He fucking jumped on that poor police horse.

52
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.970
Jesus Christ.
You know,

53
00:03:09.971 --> 00:03:13.920
that horse was wishing it was a fucking clydesdale when he got on his goddamn

54
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:14.980
back.
Um,

55
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.200
I'm just in a bad mood because I'm in San Francisco,
right?

56
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.730
I fucking came here yesterday and no guy has even looked at me.

57
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.730
No.
I came here yesterday and it was sunny out.

58
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.760
One of the rare sunny beautiful days and San Francisco when it is sunny out,

59
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.190
when the weather's nice can fuck with any city.

60
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.780
I'll even say in North America,
forget about the continental United States,

61
00:03:42.781 --> 00:03:46.320
including Alaska and Hawaii and some of our tributaries like fucking Puerto
Rico.

62
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.640
Dare
I say Fox with any city.
Okay.
However,

63
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.690
on the usual cloudy,
rainy day,

64
00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.960
this place,
there's a misery to this fucking place.
This it's cold,

65
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.220
wet air blowing against you as you walk up yet another fucking hill,

66
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.370
you know,
nothing is ever downhill.

67
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:13.050
It's always up a hill around a corner to an even steeper hill,
you know,

68
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.490
and they still have all that mamas and Papas,
you know,
although leaves are Brown,

69
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.770
Hippie vibe going out here a little bit,

70
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.720
even all the evil people from fucking a silicone valley,

71
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.390
which I still never know quite where that is.

72
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.850
It's somewhere down near like San Jose.

73
00:04:29.851 --> 00:04:32.250
I just don't know where it begins and where it ends.

74
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.500
But silicone to me and my level of intellect,

75
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.570
the amount of books that I've read in life,

76
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.520
silicone to me is and will always be what's in fake titties.

77
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.860
So,
you know,
I don't know what they're doing.
I actually flew up here,

78
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.700
uh,
rented a helicopter and flew up here with a couple people,

79
00:04:53.701 --> 00:04:58.170
had a great fucking time,
picked up a couple of hours and um,

80
00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.210
we went by this giant building that was this huge circle and I was like,

81
00:05:03.211 --> 00:05:07.910
what the fuck is that?
That looks like,
I dunno,

82
00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.300
it looks like like the Pentagon.
If it was groovy man,
right.

83
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.360
I was like,
what is that?
And my buddy Jesse goes is probably,
maybe it's apple.

84
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.780
I never seen a building.
Like it was just a total circle.

85
00:05:20.781 --> 00:05:23.420
Then in the middle there was like all of this,

86
00:05:23.421 --> 00:05:26.780
like it looked like a jungle in the middle,
you know?

87
00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.130
And if you look down you could see the employee screaming and waving going,

88
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.190
get me Outta here.
He's still alive.
Steve is still alive.

89
00:05:34.191 --> 00:05:35.180
I think that's what it said.

90
00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.290
But I was too busy focusing on not hitting somebody else while I was up there.

91
00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.540
It turns out it was the apple building.
Very impressive,

92
00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.310
very fucking impressive structure.
And then we went right by Stanford.

93
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.810
And so that stadium,
I buddy was hitting me with a trivia before we got there.

94
00:05:50.811 --> 00:05:53.810
He goes,
I went to a game,
I went to a Superbowl.

95
00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:58.130
He claimed it was the only super bowl ever played at a college or something like

96
00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:58.251
<v 4>that.</v>

97
00:05:58.251 --> 00:06:00.900
Which isn't true because they played a bunch at the rose bowl and also a two

98
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.150
lane maybe said the last one played at a college stadium.
Was it that,

99
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.480
I forget what it was.
Don't blame him.
Blame me for not remembering.

100
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:14.190
And uh,
I was able to get sad.
I said was the,
uh,

101
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.680
40 niners dolphins at Stanford Stadium?

102
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.530
Only because I had recently read that that's where they played that game.

103
00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:26.120
And because I got that right,
he then had to be like,
what was the score?

104
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:30.290
I was like,
I dunno.
But Fulton Walker took a kickoff back for the first time.

105
00:06:30.291 --> 00:06:33.290
A soup bowl history.
It's like 35,
10.

106
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:37.693
So anyways,

107
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:44.030
we fucking land at San Francisco International Airport,
which it's so,

108
00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:48.350
it's so much different.
You know,
when you,

109
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.800
when you actually get to see how cool it fuck it looks when you sit in the back

110
00:06:51.801 --> 00:06:55.880
of the tube,
you know,
and you're just looking out the back,
just praying,
you know,

111
00:06:55.881 --> 00:06:57.680
just please get this thing on the fucking ground.

112
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:59.720
It's different when you come up there.
It's fucking amazing.

113
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.040
It's expensive as shit,
but it's amazing,
right?
So we land,

114
00:07:04.041 --> 00:07:06.290
everything's going great.
And uh,

115
00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:12.370
I ended up doing this thing with the,
what is it?

116
00:07:12.371 --> 00:07:15.370
The San Francisco,
uh,
sketch fest.

117
00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:20.830
And um,
I did this,
what was it?
The,
uh,

118
00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:27.020
who's the guy from Cuba?
Castro,

119
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:31.820
the Castro theater with Kevin Pollak.
And we just went out and,

120
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.980
uh,
sort of an interview,

121
00:07:33.981 --> 00:07:36.620
just riff and fucking around and then people came up and ask questions

122
00:07:36.621 --> 00:07:38.100
afterwards.
I want to thank everybody who showed up.

123
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:42.170
It was like one in the afternoon.
All of these people showed up.

124
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:46.640
It was a great time and a canvas,

125
00:07:46.641 --> 00:07:48.620
just the greatest fucking dude ever.
And we actually,

126
00:07:48.621 --> 00:07:53.000
I got to do a scene with him in a movie coming up called a front runner.

127
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.760
It's coming up this year.
Um,

128
00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:00.390
we had a great time doing that.
And uh,
you know,
San Francisco,

129
00:08:00.391 --> 00:08:02.790
why in a bad mood belt?
The south sounds great.
It's all great.

130
00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:07.050
It's all fucking great.
Then I get to my hotel,
of course,

131
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:10.560
I show up right in the lady takes my driver's license.
I forgot.

132
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:13.620
Did Not just show it to her like she took the driver's license,
right?

133
00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:17.580
So then she starts clicking on a keyboard and say,
Hey,
can you do me a favor?

134
00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:21.380
Keep,
can you not type any personal information on a license?

135
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:25.410
And she got all this fucking attitude.
She goes,
I am not,

136
00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:28.560
I will tell you what I'm typing in.
And Pablo and his whole fucking,
you know,

137
00:08:28.561 --> 00:08:31.380
snap to the 12th to the six,
whatever the fucking kids say,

138
00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:34.470
I want to be like lady lady,

139
00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.170
you're not going to tell me what you're going to do.

140
00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:41.400
I'm going to tell you what you're not going to do,
you fucking cunt.

141
00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:45.020
But of course they can't say that,
you know,
I can't say that do,

142
00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:48.480
I don't know what the fuck happened to customer service,

143
00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:51.390
but her fucking added to the way she talked to me,

144
00:08:51.391 --> 00:08:53.550
it was like I told her how to parent your kid.

145
00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:57.410
So then she looks at me up.

146
00:08:57.411 --> 00:09:00.890
Of course they don't fucking half me down cause I probably miscommunicated when

147
00:09:00.891 --> 00:09:05.420
I was going to come up here anyways.
I just didn't say a fucking word.
Right.

148
00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:12.190
And then she went out of her way and actually got me,
you know,

149
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.720
she didn't get it.
I mean out of the way she fucking did her job.
Fuck her.

150
00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:18.220
I still fuck her
sir.
I'm going to tell you when,

151
00:09:18.221 --> 00:09:22.060
but like what enough.
I felt like I was getting booked.

152
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:28.560
I just,
I,
I fucking,
I don't understand what has happened to customer service.

153
00:09:28.561 --> 00:09:32.310
So then I was just like,
oh,
all right,
all right,
fucking whatever.
All right.

154
00:09:32.311 --> 00:09:35.280
And then this hotel turns out they don't have the two things that I need in a

155
00:09:35.281 --> 00:09:35.730
hotel.

156
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:40.230
The only two fucking things I need other than a fucking door that doesn't open

157
00:09:40.231 --> 00:09:44.580
up out into the parking lot.
In other words,
I'm not staying in a motel.
Okay.

158
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:48.990
And all I need is some sort of gym and an ironing board.
That's it.

159
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:52.880
This hotel has,
neither
has,

160
00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:54.720
neither has little steam fucking machine.

161
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:59.730
I don't want to steam my fucking clothes.
I practice my drum shit,

162
00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.190
but I'm on the road and bring a little practice pad.

163
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.910
And after all these years of trying to find a fucking table that fits right in

164
00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:10.500
the ironing board was there the whole time he just play standing up.
Okay.

165
00:10:10.501 --> 00:10:12.570
And you can adjust it down.
If it's not high enough,

166
00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:15.270
you just put a couple of towels underneath and then it's at the height you

167
00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:20.190
needed to be.
They don't fucking have one.
Um,
and then lastly,

168
00:10:20.191 --> 00:10:22.440
I went to go get a burrito and I fucked up.

169
00:10:22.441 --> 00:10:24.660
Like San Francisco makes the best burritos.
Right?

170
00:10:24.661 --> 00:10:27.240
They got the best break perfected them.
I don't know where they came from.

171
00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:31.530
I believe France invented the Burrito.
I'm not sure.
Um,

172
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:36.660
so there's this fucking,
I'm not gonna name the Burrito place,

173
00:10:36.661 --> 00:10:39.690
but evidently they got a great spot in the mission and I'm all the way down near

174
00:10:39.691 --> 00:10:43.020
the fucking touristy area where they got like rides to Alcatraz.
I'm like,

175
00:10:43.021 --> 00:10:44.520
I'm not fucking going all the way out there.

176
00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:48.600
I want to watch both these fucking football games.
And no one behold,

177
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:50.290
I find that there's,
there's a guy that,

178
00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:54.870
there's a one that's in on everybody's top 10 lists that makes a fucking Burrito

179
00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:59.400
in the mission,
but also has another location down near the fishermen place.

180
00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:01.860
Right.
The wharf down here.
So I'm like,
all right,

181
00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:05.610
well I know it's probably not gonna be as good as the original cause that's the

182
00:11:05.611 --> 00:11:10.110
original oven and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
So I fucking go to the new,

183
00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:15.830
this obviously the second one that they opened,
I show up.
Right.

184
00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:17.470
And uh,

185
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:19.270
<v 3>yeah,</v>

186
00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:20.860
<v 4>it's like fucking,
I don't know,</v>

187
00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:23.770
a group of Ford Front of me in a group of two in front of me.

188
00:11:23.771 --> 00:11:26.920
And you would've thought the amount of time it took them to order a fucking

189
00:11:26.921 --> 00:11:30.820
Burrito,
you would've thought that they were trying to like,
you know,

190
00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:34.510
it was like war time and they were trying to catch the last flight out before

191
00:11:34.511 --> 00:11:37.180
the,
you know,
the impending regime or whatever.

192
00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:40.030
It's going to send them to a fucking labor camp.

193
00:11:40.031 --> 00:11:41.950
That's like how long they want negotiating this.

194
00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:46.030
And what kills me is these four people that took for fucking ever then the two

195
00:11:46.031 --> 00:11:51.031
people behind him who had enough time to fucking go on Youtube,

196
00:11:51.701 --> 00:11:56.140
find out what's in a Burrito to a fucking supermarket,
buy the Shit and cook one.

197
00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:00.610
That's the amount of time they had it.
They step up to the register.

198
00:12:00.611 --> 00:12:03.760
It's their moment of truth to order a Burrito and they'll start looking at the

199
00:12:03.761 --> 00:12:08.330
menu.
Uh,
we're good.
Uh,
ugh.

200
00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:09.773
<v 3>Okay.</v>

201
00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.790
<v 4>Fucking ridiculous.
Fucking ridiculous.
So I get up there.
What do you want?</v>

202
00:12:15.791 --> 00:12:17.170
Give me an original burrito.
Chicken.

203
00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:18.720
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

204
00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:23.670
<v 4>Chips and salsa and a water to go.
Cash.
Thank you.</v>

205
00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:25.020
Step aside over.

206
00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:26.370
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

207
00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:27.450
<v 4>How hard is that?</v>

208
00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:29.140
<v 3>Okay.</v>

209
00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:29.721
<v 4>You know what it is,</v>

210
00:12:29.721 --> 00:12:33.080
is somewhere in the last century became illegal to punch somebody in the back of

211
00:12:33.081 --> 00:12:37.040
the head when they were taking too long in a line.
And now everybody,
they just,

212
00:12:37.041 --> 00:12:38.600
you know,
they just a little too comfortable.

213
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:40.230
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

214
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:44.480
<v 4>They're just a little too comfortable.
So I'm standing there and,
uh,</v>

215
00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:49.290
you know,
now in behind the fucking couple that you know,
over the salsa line,

216
00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:54.390
Salsa line,
salsa,
salsa line and uh,

217
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:59.410
I'm behind them again and it's taking them forever to get fucking salsa.

218
00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:02.693
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

219
00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:05.520
<v 4>The fucking looking around and they're looking at other people.
It's like,</v>

220
00:13:05.521 --> 00:13:10.260
use your fucking braid.
Mild,
medium,
hot

221
00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:16.660
the fuck
touchdown sites.

222
00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:19.900
Or when then say,
[inaudible] go marching in

223
00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:28.810
[inaudible]
oh,
oh,
plenty of time left.
No,
there isn't.

224
00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.621
What am I talking about?

225
00:13:29.621 --> 00:13:32.950
I thought that was fucking one 18 into the third quarter.
Well,

226
00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.360
I guess there's plenty of time left,
Roy.

227
00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:39.780
This is the way the game is played nowadays.
It's like,
do they go for two here?

228
00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:44.790
There's only a quarter in a minute.
13 left.
Kick the fucking extra point.

229
00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:49.560
<v 3>Um,
yeah.</v>

230
00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:53.510
<v 4>Jesus Christ.
That guy just had a soul patch on the back of his head.</v>

231
00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:00.220
Wow.
You know,
tough.
You have to be to have that calf because somebody just,

232
00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:03.040
how hard it would be to not tell the guy how fucking annoying that.
It's like,

233
00:14:03.041 --> 00:14:06.760
dude,
I just want to fucking,
can you just grow it out?
A shave it off.

234
00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:10.453
<v 3>MMM.</v>

235
00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:11.990
<v 4>All right.
Touchdown saints.</v>

236
00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:13.550
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

237
00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:14.630
<v 4>Touched my prediction lives.</v>

238
00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:20.050
This is such a disturbing commercial with this guy falls off the cruise ship.

239
00:14:20.051 --> 00:14:22.480
This is one of my biggest fucking fears in life.

240
00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:25.053
<v 3>You know what I mean?</v>

241
00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:28.160
<v 4>Just being in the fucking ocean,</v>

242
00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:33.110
praying for hypothermia to set it before some of something comes up to you and

243
00:14:33.111 --> 00:14:34.070
just takes a bite out of you.

244
00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:39.910
Can you imagine when you see that fucking shark fin?
Just break the water,

245
00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:42.493
<v 3>you know,</v>

246
00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:46.710
<v 4>and you know,
you smell the thing.
Fucking wild animals.</v>

247
00:14:46.711 --> 00:14:48.780
You could smell them from a mile away to the point.

248
00:14:48.781 --> 00:14:50.850
I don't understand how they're able to kill anybody.

249
00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:52.640
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

250
00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:53.200
<v 4>yeah.
No you didn't.</v>

251
00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.390
You haven't go to the fucking sue when you just smell those goddamn lions.

252
00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:03.130
I guess that'd be everything stinks out there,
you know?
Um,

253
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:05.473
anyways.

254
00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:06.910
<v 3>Okay.</v>

255
00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:08.770
<v 4>And they just leave the guy in the fucking ocean</v>

256
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.940
fucking really bothers me.
I this gotta be somebody complaining about that,

257
00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:16.213
<v 0>you know,</v>

258
00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:19.320
<v 4>once a year that seems to happen or every couple of years,</v>

259
00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:23.930
like somebody goes on a honeymoon and their spouse fucking falls overboard.

260
00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:25.783
<v 0>You know,</v>

261
00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.270
<v 4>I gotta look that up.
How many fucking times?
What do you,
what are the odds?</v>

262
00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:35.990
Are the odds higher on a honeymoon or FD been married for awhile?

263
00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:41.790
Like how many times somebody who's like fucking thrown his spouse overboard,

264
00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:47.480
you know?
And if it's anywhere near the number that I think it is,

265
00:15:47.481 --> 00:15:50.090
I want to know why it doesn't have its own Hashtag.

266
00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:53.480
I think we need to start a Hashtag on Twitter.

267
00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:56.240
Let me just do fucking three seconds of a

268
00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:00.740
research here.
Spouse,

269
00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:04.130
how do you spell spouse?
I just spelled spas.

270
00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.040
Spouse.
What would I look up?
Your spouse,

271
00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:11.463
<v 0>dead</v>

272
00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:16.850
<v 4>cruise ship.
Uh,</v>

273
00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.920
significant other question mark.

274
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:26.390
When a passenger dies it see what you need to know.

275
00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:33.250
Oh my God,
what do they do?
Do they have a burial?
At Sea,
you know,

276
00:16:33.251 --> 00:16:37.780
with the Carnival cruise line flag and they try to make it look official is just

277
00:16:37.781 --> 00:16:42.250
sitting there looking at fucking Gilligan and Gofer.
Um,

278
00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:44.920
so that the guy's named Golfer guy became like a senator.

279
00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:49.900
Husband pleads not guilty and wife's cruise ship killing.
Oh my God.

280
00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:55.360
Cheese.
If they,
if they figure out,
ah,
can you imagine that?

281
00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.750
Wow.
That's,
that's just cruel and unusual punishment.

282
00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:02.980
The bad enough you killed somebody.

283
00:17:02.981 --> 00:17:07.090
The fact that you would send them to that of a lonely,
brutal death.

284
00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:12.120
I Utah Man who allegedly brutally murdered his wife last month while onboard and

285
00:17:12.401 --> 00:17:16.710
Alaska.
Oh,
we just,
it killed her on,
yeah.
All right,
well Jesus,

286
00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:21.540
there's some fucking serious music dude who composed that,
hey,

287
00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:22.920
this guy killed his wife.

288
00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:28.050
This guy killed his wife on a fucking cruise ship in this Guy Jay.
We need,

289
00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.780
we need music for that.
And that guy,
you just come,

290
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:35.530
I can't get back to the fade in that one.

291
00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:39.410
That was what the Jimmy page army a fucking guitars there.

292
00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:41.841
Can you imagine that?

293
00:17:41.841 --> 00:17:44.300
You want us to write the next stairway to heaven and now you just write in

294
00:17:44.301 --> 00:17:46.790
fucking music.
You know,

295
00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:50.550
that fits people dying on a fucking cruise ship.
Okay.

296
00:17:50.551 --> 00:17:54.900
This dude is accused of first degree murder in the death of his 39 year old
wife.

297
00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:02.420
Uh,
she must've fucking choked her and shuffle board or something.

298
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:04.520
I'm sorry.

299
00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:09.380
A Kenneth's wife was found dead in her cruise ship cabin on July 25th.

300
00:18:09.381 --> 00:18:11.510
That's the couple had a domestic dispute.

301
00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.950
Oh my God.
D there's,
you know,
they should throw this guy overboard.

302
00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.620
Jesus Christ

303
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:27.240
said blood was spread throughout the room on multiple surfaces.

304
00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:33.420
Who's immediately detained by ship security in a witness said that the,

305
00:18:33.421 --> 00:18:38.240
the defendant allegedly told him she would not stop laughing at me.

306
00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:42.800
Jesus Christ.

307
00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:48.580
What the food she ridiculing him.

308
00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:50.270
<v 3>Okay.</v>

309
00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:52.400
<v 4>You know,
it's funny if this was the other way around.</v>

310
00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:53.750
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

311
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:58.500
<v 4>I think the woman goes free if,
if she just said he was fat shaming her,</v>

312
00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:00.920
like she put on some baby weight or something like that and he just,

313
00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:05.670
he wouldn't stop laughing at me and I just made me feel like I was small

314
00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:12.170
each year over 4,000 men laugh at their recently not pregnant wise,

315
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:18.110
causing them to feel bad about themselves.
Um,
okay.

316
00:19:18.111 --> 00:19:19.790
He had been acting terrible all night.

317
00:19:19.791 --> 00:19:23.420
The source claim adding at some point that evening ac.
Yeah.

318
00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:27.980
She sent me not stop laughing at you and go for a walk.

319
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:32.550
What F wow.
What was going that he,

320
00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:35.340
that guy is not just a straight up fucking psycho,

321
00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:37.763
<v 3>you know</v>

322
00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:40.840
<v 4>like what the fuck was going on.</v>

323
00:19:40.841 --> 00:19:43.000
I mean movies could you make out of that relationship

324
00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:46.551
like if,

325
00:19:46.551 --> 00:19:50.850
if that guy never did anything wrong in his life and she was just so fucking

326
00:19:50.851 --> 00:19:54.120
sadistic,
sadistic and his so gotten into his fucking head.

327
00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:55.553
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

328
00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:00.710
<v 4>That her just laughing at him,
Pete,
that he fucking snap like that.
You know,</v>

329
00:20:00.711 --> 00:20:02.840
I'm just playing the other side.
I'm just playing devil's advocate here.

330
00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:07.760
Interception Sal.
Window saints go marching in

331
00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:15.620
[inaudible]
how annoying them.
I do the fucking person next to me.
Case Keatum

332
00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:19.670
case case and drew.

333
00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:21.520
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

334
00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:26.200
<v 4>those are the quarterbacks
used to be.
Joe Verse Phillip</v>

335
00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:34.330
Roger Verse Terry.
What are some of the great rivalry names?

336
00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:38.753
Dan Verse Kenny.

337
00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:39.990
<v 3>Okay.</v>

338
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:44.920
<v 4>Dan Fouts first.
Kenny Anderson in that fucking freezing bowl.
Oh wait.</v>

339
00:20:44.921 --> 00:20:48.190
Definitely stepped out of bounds.
You can see there.
That's exactly

340
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:52.540
<v 1>what happened there.
You can't see any grade between the white light gaze.</v>

341
00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:56.950
Kanombe got out of giant IPAD.
It's going to play a little donkey.

342
00:20:56.951 --> 00:20:59.200
Kong put on a hat.
There you go.

343
00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:03.790
Hugs all around like the game has been one on the safe side.

344
00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:06.510
<v 5>Okay.</v>

345
00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:08.490
<v 1>Does it mean to the saints?
The uniforms look a little cheap.</v>

346
00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:11.880
I don't know what's going on.
They take some stripe away and this shirt,

347
00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:14.850
it looks like they,

348
00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:19.270
they should be playing on a half a field inside of hockey arena.
Um,

349
00:21:19.271 --> 00:21:21.910
I write drill brazy,
he's got the ball.
Hey,

350
00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:27.190
hands that off and that guy immediately it's tackled what a waste of a play.

351
00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:33.610
Um,
when o two to go in the fucking third quarter.

352
00:21:33.611 --> 00:21:35.440
You want me announced the rest of the third quarter for you?

353
00:21:35.441 --> 00:21:37.900
Some of you guys like when I do this shit.
All right,

354
00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:44.070
number 29,
he's upset.
What is he upset about?
I Dunno,

355
00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:47.740
but a guy with fucking night vision glasses is talking to them.
Listen,

356
00:21:47.741 --> 00:21:50.860
I just got from the gun range.
I didn't see what happened,
but I believe in you

357
00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:56.400
29.
What the fuck is he doing out there?
That's a running back number,
isn't it?

358
00:21:58.880 --> 00:21:59.070
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

359
00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:00.750
<v 1>Maybe he's mad at,
maybe he's mad at case.</v>

360
00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:03.550
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

361
00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:05.260
<v 1>get off my case.
Keenum sorry.</v>

362
00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:09.010
Jubilees drops back to pass over the fucking middle.

363
00:22:09.011 --> 00:22:12.880
When those sates scared of fucking first down.
Woo.

364
00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.560
Why do I give a shit about this game?

365
00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:18.150
It's literally just cause I told Paul Versey that I thought the sates are going

366
00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:18.491
to win,

367
00:22:18.491 --> 00:22:22.600
that I need this to happen to fill me up in life because I'm a married guy and

368
00:22:22.601 --> 00:22:24.690
you know,
and the compliments,
you know,
they're,

369
00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:28.240
they're on their own other we're on,
I'm on like a compliment rationed.

370
00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:35.080
I get one a season and there's only one season in La.

371
00:22:35.081 --> 00:22:37.780
I used to get four a year when I lived in New York.
Now I'm out in La.

372
00:22:37.781 --> 00:22:42.460
I get about one.
Um,
how do you get that job?
Is Water Water Guy?

373
00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:47.840
Like how do you know who's fucking thirsty?
Nobody ever points them out.

374
00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:52.090
You just kind of walk up.
You stick it,
you know?
All right.

375
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.681
I swear to God,

376
00:22:53.681 --> 00:22:56.290
the black guy in this commercial looks like they stuck his head on like an eight

377
00:22:56.291 --> 00:23:00.260
year old's body.
Um,

378
00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:05.750
although I do like this commercial
built,
nobody gives a fuck.

379
00:23:05.751 --> 00:23:07.040
Most people aren't even watching this.

380
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:08.450
They don't even know what you're talking about.

381
00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:11.810
You're literally doing common commentary for fucking Youtube video that doesn't

382
00:23:11.811 --> 00:23:13.490
exist while they're listening to your podcasts.

383
00:23:13.491 --> 00:23:15.890
Get back on the fucking game here.

384
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:21.150
I'm fucking Steelers.
What are the,
what is what?
The Steelers,

385
00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:24.770
how many times are they going to look past the opponent that week?
That's,
that's,

386
00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:26.030
that's what they say it out there.

387
00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:31.540
They're saying that they focus too much on the New England patriots because you

388
00:23:32.451 --> 00:23:36.560
know who's kidding who?
They beat the Patriots earlier this year,
you know?

389
00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:38.070
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

390
00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:40.530
<v 1>That was a touch.
I don't know.
You know what I don't understand about,
you know,</v>

391
00:23:40.531 --> 00:23:42.720
whether it's a catch or whether it's not a catch,

392
00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:48.410
is the fact the ground can't cause a fumble if you're running.

393
00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:55.340
But if you're,
it can cause it can cause an incomplete pass.
That how it works.

394
00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:58.553
<v 6>I Dunno.</v>

395
00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:01.620
<v 1>I have no idea.
But I liked that commercial.</v>

396
00:24:01.621 --> 00:24:04.830
I just saw that guy was like practicing speed skating,
like in his living room.

397
00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:07.890
That'll be like the latest thing people will get.

398
00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:09.810
Rather than reading about nutrition,

399
00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:12.300
they'll literally spend like fucking 10 grand on that thing.

400
00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:13.820
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

401
00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:16.850
<v 1>And then they'll have some sort of app where they can project it onto their TV</v>

402
00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:18.680
where they can,
you can be,
you know,

403
00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:23.420
in different speed skating or arenas around the fucking world.

404
00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:26.900
I saw this picture today on the Internet.
It just,
fuck it.

405
00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:30.470
It made me feel so goddamn old.
It was this woman.
Right?

406
00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:33.970
Where's that place where people go to vacation,
right?
It's like the,

407
00:24:33.971 --> 00:24:38.150
the ocean looks absolutely perfect.
And then Z,
these grass,

408
00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:42.140
like these huts and the hover out over the water,
you know,

409
00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:46.940
one tsunami in everybody's dead right?
But it looks like absolute paradise.

410
00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:52.160
Okay.
And the picture of this woman,
she's in a thong,

411
00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:55.400
right leaning on one leg,

412
00:24:55.401 --> 00:25:00.401
so her butt cheeks sticking out and she's looking at the huts and over her head,

413
00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.310
she,
she's making,
you know,
those,

414
00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:06.320
that stupid thing where you make the heart with your hands.

415
00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:11.720
She still wasn't that,
you know,
and that it made me feel so fucking old.

416
00:25:11.721 --> 00:25:12.300
It's like,

417
00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:17.090
what if it happened to just go into a fucking unbelievable place and just

418
00:25:17.091 --> 00:25:20.780
geeking out and taken a picture of yourself and you have that look on your face

419
00:25:20.781 --> 00:25:22.100
like you can't believe you there.

420
00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:28.120
Like she literally used that paradise to enhance her whole fucking like,

421
00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:32.510
I don't know what the word is her,
her Nis,

422
00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:40.320
I dunno,
the Selfie just,

423
00:25:40.321 --> 00:25:45.060
it just makes everybody act like a Douche who doesn't know how to behave when

424
00:25:45.061 --> 00:25:49.620
they get their road show.
In other words,
they behave like myself.
What's going on?

425
00:25:49.621 --> 00:25:52.890
I stepped out of bounds,
eight yards.
He picked up eight yards.

426
00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:56.160
I'll tell you right now,
you know what I tell you?

427
00:25:56.161 --> 00:25:58.230
Who's going to make a big a lot of fucking money?

428
00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:01.710
Whoever owns the cleanest store in the mall of America.

429
00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:07.200
It's my prediction that every one of these men is soda fans are going to fucking

430
00:26:07.201 --> 00:26:10.050
at the end of this game or they're all going to go out of the mall of America

431
00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:11.970
and they're going to go into the Kleenex store.

432
00:26:11.971 --> 00:26:13.920
They're going to get their own fucking,
you know,

433
00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:18.030
Kleenex with their own initial on it.
Cause everybody's fucking special now.

434
00:26:18.031 --> 00:26:19.500
And you can take a selfie.

435
00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:23.330
But how sad you are actually no,

436
00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:27.330
it would be amazing is if the vikings go to the Superbowl.
Okay.

437
00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:30.110
And they play a home game.
Ah,
first.

438
00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:32.973
<v 7>Ah,</v>

439
00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:34.890
<v 1>oh.</v>

440
00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:39.890
When the saints go marching in there down to the fucking two yard line.

441
00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:45.690
You guys like Pete Fountain?
Huh?
Put on the old gray bonnet.

442
00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:51.410
I Love Pete Fountain.
Fuck.
You always had to kill a drummer,

443
00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:56.240
right?
Played the shit out of the clarinet,

444
00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:01.040
you know what I mean?
And he's never had any sexual harassment scandals.

445
00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:07.670
Um,
anyways,
plowing ahead here.
Oh,
Jesus Christ,

446
00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:11.480
this fucking guy.
This guy hurt.
Now what happened?
What happened to the guy?

447
00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:14.150
Does he got to go inside the tent?
Well,

448
00:27:14.151 --> 00:27:17.120
thank God there's an 80 year old bald white guy to help him off the field.

449
00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:24.370
The dude was so short,
he couldn't even lean on him.

450
00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:27.130
He's probably gonna have a separated shoulder.

451
00:27:27.131 --> 00:27:30.400
By the time he gets over to that little fucking little pop tent they put him in.

452
00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:33.161
Um,
hey,

453
00:27:33.161 --> 00:27:36.910
I think I found the MP three player that now that I'm seeing this poor bastard

454
00:27:36.911 --> 00:27:38.270
with the umbilical cord hanging out,

455
00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:41.950
I'm getting out of the apple world ready as I said that,

456
00:27:41.951 --> 00:27:44.440
that Weirdo just stared at me in the galaxy commercial.

457
00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:47.950
Like he knew I was going to fuck it,
do it.
Um,

458
00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:53.620
I'm going to get a new,
uh,
MP.
I'm going to go with one of those Sony,

459
00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:58.330
you know,
and I want to tell you guys the exact model so you can be like,
dude,

460
00:27:58.331 --> 00:28:01.750
oh my God.
Really?
You're going to buy the

461
00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:05.620
yeah,
I am.
I am.

462
00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:10.800
Because I have a bunch of music that I didn't get on fucking a apple and those

463
00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:14.050
round building cunts.
Okay.

464
00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:18.670
But the forest in the middle where they reeducate their employees that want to

465
00:28:18.671 --> 00:28:21.940
ask for more money or maybe pay the poor bastards that put together their

466
00:28:21.941 --> 00:28:26.230
products so they don't jump to their fucking deaths.
Uh,

467
00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:31.090
how crazy would be if they still advertise on this podcast after that?
Um,

468
00:28:32.290 --> 00:28:32.790
<v 3>yeah.</v>

469
00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:35.410
<v 4>Yeah.
I want to fucking get out of that world.
I want to go,
I'm like,</v>

470
00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:37.350
I still want to use this shit,
but I still don't.

471
00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:39.990
I don't like how they were all there.
Like fucking a,

472
00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:44.710
this is our shit over here.
I should only works with our,
with our shit.

473
00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:49.670
None of that shit works with other people's Shit.
Do you want to use that shit?

474
00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:53.030
You got to buy our other shit to use our shit.
Fuck people's other shit.

475
00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:54.380
We're going to fucking own everything.

476
00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:59.290
<v 1>Oh,
so wait,
what is your problem?
How many billions of dollars d I,</v>

477
00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:03.150
I swear to God at that point.
Um,
I know a promoted like that.

478
00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:07.260
I know promoted like that.
He wants to make all the money.
You know,

479
00:29:07.261 --> 00:29:09.360
it's not enough that he's making the most money.

480
00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:12.690
He wants to make all the money and it actually gives them joy

481
00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:19.460
when,
when other people,
uh,
when other people's,
uh,
you know,

482
00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:24.140
other promoters in his town are not doing well.
He'll just say,
oh,

483
00:29:24.141 --> 00:29:27.290
did you hear about someone sold?
They poke solids.
I a guy took a bath

484
00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:33.230
and I'd be like,
Oh,
I bet that makes you happy.
I fucking it.
Um,

485
00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:38.870
anyways,
I guess I never gave you guys a Hashtag,
uh,

486
00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:42.100
for the cruise ships.
Why don't you come up with one?
Oh,

487
00:29:42.101 --> 00:29:47.050
here comes to 10 pop up tent.
Dick's sporting good.
All right,
let's see.
A Dick.

488
00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:51.370
What happened?
Did he hit your left ball?
You're right ball.
All right,

489
00:29:51.371 --> 00:29:52.300
we're going to freeze it here.

490
00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:55.690
We're going to do a little fucking put a little desk and next on it and a,

491
00:29:55.691 --> 00:29:58.350
I think you'd be all right.
All right.

492
00:29:58.351 --> 00:30:01.950
Drew Brees hands the ball off a knee guy runs it to everybody.

493
00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:04.620
Evidently there was supposed to be a hole there.
You know,
when I was a kid,

494
00:30:04.621 --> 00:30:07.470
I thought that running backs rather than running around the outside,

495
00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:11.460
the reason why they ran in the middle's cause they thought they'd get famous for

496
00:30:11.461 --> 00:30:15.120
trying to do something so impossible.
Um,

497
00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:17.580
what do you guys think is going to happen here?
Actually,
you already know.

498
00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:20.490
I say that they're going to score on third goal,

499
00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:22.693
<v 6>right?</v>

500
00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:25.490
<v 1>Unless they try and run it three fucking times.</v>

501
00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:29.480
How about a little play action fake here.
Drove for the love of fucking Christ.

502
00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:34.400
Oh,
by the way,
congratulations to Liverpool.
Huh?
Liverpool.

503
00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:35.930
Be fucking man city.

504
00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:39.680
Guess you guys didn't realize I've been paying attention a little bit to the

505
00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:42.550
premier league.
That soccer for everybody here in North

506
00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:47.420
<v 8>America.
Drew Brees throws that Dan went them saints go marching.</v>

507
00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:52.170
<v 1>Hm.
It's fucking 17 too,
mother fucking 13.</v>

508
00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:57.840
All right.
Okay.
Case Kayden case.
Caden,

509
00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:02.610
he's on the case Canaan.
They must do a bunch of shit like that,
right?

510
00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:07.980
Anytime.
Uh,
you know,
they always have the ponds,
right?

511
00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:11.250
You must do a bunch of those things.
Jesus Christ.

512
00:31:11.251 --> 00:31:15.720
This is that's becoming a tale of two halves.
It comes drew Brees.

513
00:31:15.721 --> 00:31:19.770
He's going to break their hearts.
I'll tell you right now then there,
right now,

514
00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:23.790
the last ride on the rollercoaster at the mall of America is happening.

515
00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:29.160
This is an overall sadness that is going to descend on that mall right now.

516
00:31:29.161 --> 00:31:33.480
There's a bunch of people that do not give a fuck.
Okay?

517
00:31:33.481 --> 00:31:36.570
Two white guys trying to do a cool handshake.
The A,

518
00:31:36.571 --> 00:31:37.500
I don't know what they just did their,

519
00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:43.440
some sort of jerk off fucking motion by drew Brees is he gave the okay sign,

520
00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:46.980
you know,
well,
these are the times.
Is it okay that I'm stroking your Dick?

521
00:31:46.981 --> 00:31:47.940
I think that that's what that meant.

522
00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:52.050
I think that was very progressive by drew Brees.
Um,

523
00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:54.300
all right.

524
00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:57.150
If you could tell I'm doing this thing early and I have yet to get any of the

525
00:31:57.151 --> 00:32:00.750
advertising.
I don't have any fucking,
uh,
any of the questions or anything.

526
00:32:00.751 --> 00:32:05.400
So at some point I'm going to have to fucking hit pause or I could text my

527
00:32:05.401 --> 00:32:09.030
fucking guy here to send me the bullshit.
Right?
That could happen.

528
00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:14.130
That could happen.
Right?
Let me hit pause.
You don't listen this fucking crap.
Oh,

529
00:32:14.131 --> 00:32:14.964
do ya

530
00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:19.980
Johnny or do you the fuck is going on with the Black Hawks this year.

531
00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:26.950
Let me,
let me,
I got to hit pause and not put you through this shit.
All right,

532
00:32:26.951 --> 00:32:27.850
I'm back.
Oh,
you know what I,

533
00:32:27.851 --> 00:32:32.851
I was going to say is if Minnesota wins this game and then goes to the Superbowl

534
00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:36.550
and uh,
I'm actually a vikings fan from way back in the day,

535
00:32:36.551 --> 00:32:38.910
to be honest with you.
I don't know why I'm,
I'm just being a Douche right now.

536
00:32:38.911 --> 00:32:43.250
Like said,
I just predicted this upset and I don't care if the Viking sweat,
ah,

537
00:32:43.251 --> 00:32:48.251
right up the middle for first dad 1302 to go in the game.

538
00:32:48.981 --> 00:32:52.040
He's not,
and he's not in like,
they didn't just give up 14 points in a row.

539
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:56.870
Every fucking guy now acts like they just reinvented football.
Look at this,

540
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:58.880
all those people block forum.

541
00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:03.500
And then when there was finally a fucking guy who could tackle him,
then he did.

542
00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:07.700
And this guy gets up like he's Steve Devacy,
Jim Brown,
get up fucking nod.

543
00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:13.670
Oh,
the old man.
Oh No,
this is,
this is what you sound like.

544
00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:15.510
The closer you get to death,
you know,
you're like,
well,

545
00:33:15.511 --> 00:33:19.640
why isn't it one way or used to be case Keenan?

546
00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:23.960
He is on a strict no passing diet right now.
They saw that last one.
They're like,

547
00:33:23.961 --> 00:33:26.480
fuck this guy just handed off.
Now why aren't you nodded?

548
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:31.850
How come you're not nodding?
No
one got stuff right at the God damn line.

549
00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:34.760
Everybody.
Anybody makes a good play.

550
00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:36.710
They appointed the name of the back of the Jersey.

551
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:39.080
Anytime they fucking don't make a play,

552
00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.670
they're looking for a flag or they run off the field.
Anyways,

553
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:43.070
if I can get through this God damn point,

554
00:33:43.071 --> 00:33:47.570
if Minnesota actually goes to the God damn Superbowl,
it's a fucking home game.

555
00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:49.913
<v 0>All right.</v>

556
00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:51.930
<v 1>Everything there is purple.</v>

557
00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:56.400
There's no way you got to have like a prince themed halftime show.

558
00:33:57.330 --> 00:33:59.480
Do you think he would have played it?
Think he would've come to the yet.
What?

559
00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:02.400
It had to have prince come back.
Look at that fucking throw case.

560
00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:05.370
Keenum shaking off the interception of the saint.
Say it's not a catch.

561
00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:07.890
They say it's not a catch.
Right.
Says,
oh my God,

562
00:34:07.891 --> 00:34:11.810
I can't even deal how fucking great and it's driving me crazy.
Case Keaton,

563
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:16.590
everybody stopped shouting,
settle down.
This is a great fucking throw.

564
00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:21.900
Oh,
he just drops it right in there.
I don't know.
A little bit of wobbly there.

565
00:34:21.901 --> 00:34:25.290
In the end he caught it,
but did he catch it long enough?

566
00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:30.780
Case Keenum gets to the aisle.
They got it or not in time.
Not In time.

567
00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:35.660
The challenge flag
these degenerate gambling.

568
00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:40.290
Looking at head coach.
It's fucking white.
Probably cries yourself to sleep.

569
00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:43.500
That's such a terrible thing to say.
Why would I say that?
All right.

570
00:34:43.501 --> 00:34:48.450
He's on the ground.
He has it.
He has it.
He has it.
He has it.
He still has it.

571
00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:53.510
If they call this not a fucking catch.
We'll give a shit.
All right.
There you go.

572
00:34:53.511 --> 00:34:57.710
That's a catch.
He's got it.
He's got it.
He's got it.
He's got it.
He's got it.

573
00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:01.333
It's got it.

574
00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:03.213
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

575
00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:04.910
<v 1>What are they going to look at?</v>

576
00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:06.553
<v 3>Okay,</v>

577
00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:10.430
<v 1>Jesus fucking Christ.
How long do you have to have it?</v>

578
00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:16.710
Oh my God.
Now I've got to see this replay.
58 fucking time.
He,

579
00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:20.140
as you see right there,
Deli has it against his navel.
It is,

580
00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:25.100
is his fucking happy trail.
Um,

581
00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:29.210
let's get pleading his case.
Take back your Red Hanky.

582
00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:32.370
<v 0>MMM.</v>

583
00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:33.670
<v 1>All right.
I know you guys do you guys,</v>

584
00:35:33.671 --> 00:35:37.440
I don't think you want to fucking lit this.
I've really limited my God.
Damn.
Here.

585
00:35:37.441 --> 00:35:38.900
Let's talk about fucking a,

586
00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:42.600
let's limit it even more and I'll talk to my six British fans over there.

587
00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:45.810
Um,
man city.

588
00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:51.230
<v 3>Oh fuck.
Oh fuck.
Yeah.</v>

589
00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:55.130
<v 1>Jesus Christ.
It was like a full fucking bottle of water and it's every on too.</v>

590
00:35:55.131 --> 00:35:59.350
And I fucking hate that shit.
That'd be,
yeah.

591
00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:02.080
There's minerals in it.
Yeah.
I can taste it.
It tastes fucking weird.

592
00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:07.470
Did the water rushed through a plastic rock?
What does it taste so fucking awful.

593
00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:08.910
I hate I fucking hate yard.

594
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:12.343
<v 3>MMM.</v>

595
00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:13.333
<v 1>Anyways.</v>

596
00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:15.450
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

597
00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:17.950
<v 1>This supposed to be like the best bottled water.
It tastes like shit.
I,</v>

598
00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:19.710
and how do I know it's from the French Alps.

599
00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:25.630
I'll drink anything.
Poland spring to Sani.

600
00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:27.610
<v 3>Okay.</v>

601
00:36:27.610 --> 00:36:30.960
<v 1>Smart water.
I'll drink that box water.</v>

602
00:36:30.961 --> 00:36:33.180
I don't give a shit even though it tastes like you're drinking out of a shoe.

603
00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:44.350
Fucking wet cardboard.
I know it's better for the environment,
but Jesus Christ.

604
00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.770
<v 3>Oh yeah,</v>

605
00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:49.970
<v 1>you,
it was the worst was when you were a little kid.</v>

606
00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:52.730
You drank out of the garden hose and you didn't realize it was sitting in the

607
00:36:52.731 --> 00:36:57.140
sun.
You'd had that fucking hot blast of Stale fucking water.

608
00:36:57.141 --> 00:36:58.760
They'd probably been there for a week.

609
00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:01.370
<v 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

610
00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:07.300
<v 1>So you know that taken out your fucking small intestine.
Um,
all right,</v>

611
00:37:07.301 --> 00:37:09.010
let's look up this man city shit.

612
00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:16.210
All right,
man.
City Man City lost four to three to Liverpool.
Now.

613
00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:20.040
Now for those of you who live in United States of Merker of Morocco,

614
00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:22.573
<v 3>mmm</v>

615
00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:26.130
<v 1>man city evidently was fucking undefeated the whole year.</v>

616
00:37:26.131 --> 00:37:28.440
I guess that's really difficult.
It's difficult to do in any sports,

617
00:37:28.441 --> 00:37:31.350
but I wasn't sure was soccer just seems like your score,

618
00:37:31.351 --> 00:37:32.970
one goal and the game's over.

619
00:37:32.971 --> 00:37:35.880
But I will tell you lately they've four to three to seven goals.

620
00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:36.870
You've got to love that.

621
00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:37.920
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

622
00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:41.690
<v 1>Got a fucking love that they lost the Liverpool home of the fucking Beatles.</v>

623
00:37:41.691 --> 00:37:46.690
That's all I know.
That's all I know about touch shit.
Oh,
let's talk about,

624
00:37:46.691 --> 00:37:50.890
let's talk about dot eight Donny fucking case.
Kate,
I'm sacked.

625
00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:54.600
<v 3>Oh No.
He got the ball up.
Donald fucking Trump.</v>

626
00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:58.540
<v 1>I got to say something,
man,
that was a low,</v>

627
00:37:59.050 --> 00:38:02.680
that is a low point in modern United States history.

628
00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:07.690
And that's fucking saying something.
You just can't,
uh,
you know,

629
00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:13.030
you know,
you just can't find it.
It's a fair balance.

630
00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:17.430
So not even apologize and say,
Hey,
you know,
I shouldn't have said it that way,

631
00:38:17.431 --> 00:38:21.870
but blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
That was just a fucking like,
I dunno what,

632
00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:23.470
and people still stick it by the guy.

633
00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:24.910
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

634
00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:29.120
<v 1>What he street can unlock it is.
All right.</v>

635
00:38:29.170 --> 00:38:32.320
Here's his number two guy number four is going to hold the ball.

636
00:38:32.321 --> 00:38:36.490
The little skinny guy.
He kicks the ball right down fucking metal.

637
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:43.420
It was one at one horn flies.
What is the,
uh,
Minnesota Vikings.

638
00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:46.810
What is the Saints Guy Bitching about now?

639
00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:51.700
What is he complaining about?
I'll tell you right now.
Okay.

640
00:38:51.701 --> 00:38:54.570
If I fuck that fucking APP.
No.
She would've said no catch.
Yes you would've.

641
00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:57.600
Yes you want.
If you just like my wife,
you just like my fucking white

642
00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:03.990
Jesus.
You don't,
you're fat.
When you can see a man tits,
suddenly the Windbreaker,

643
00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:08.970
oh,
he was saying the guy was down.
All right.
Nobody cares.
Bill.

644
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.550
This is one of the worst podcasts I've ever done.
I apologize.
Okay.

645
00:39:11.551 --> 00:39:15.000
And I'm sure you guys will let me know.
All right.
Oh,

646
00:39:15.001 --> 00:39:17.670
so the burrito ended up getting like at the,
it just sucked.

647
00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:21.660
Wasn't wrapped tight or I guess I'm supposed to keep it in the foil.

648
00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:25.970
I have no fucking idea.
And then the chicken was like overcooked.
You don't,

649
00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:29.940
this is what happens.
This is what happens when you go to a city and you go,

650
00:39:29.941 --> 00:39:31.860
you know what?
These people are known for this.

651
00:39:31.890 --> 00:39:34.290
And then you as a tourist don't know where to go.

652
00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:38.940
And you just go out and get one and then you go back to your city with the,
the,

653
00:39:38.941 --> 00:39:42.840
the wrong information saying,
I went there,
their burrito sucked.

654
00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:45.480
It didn't tell you I could make a better breed of than that.
You know,

655
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:47.120
that's like,
you know,
people go to Chicago,

656
00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:49.980
New York and they say that their pizza sucks.
It's like,
well,

657
00:39:49.981 --> 00:39:53.550
who did you hang out with?
Will you with people from the city?

658
00:39:53.551 --> 00:39:58.350
Did they tell you where to fuck to go?
Um,
Oh,
you know what?

659
00:39:58.351 --> 00:40:01.020
I want it to look up because people are sitting there saying,
oh,

660
00:40:01.021 --> 00:40:04.530
they got it when peach fucking Donald Trump.
And it's just like,
well,

661
00:40:04.531 --> 00:40:08.730
they impeach Bill Clinton.
He got impeached.
I was like,
Holy Shit.

662
00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:13.030
Hey,
he's going to have to leave.
And then he,
he didn't,
he just,

663
00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:19.780
why didn't Bill Clinton leave?

664
00:40:21.730 --> 00:40:25.300
And then I'll just write in peach,
right?
That she get me.
Are you spelling?

665
00:40:25.301 --> 00:40:28.420
Peached there you go.
Impeached.

666
00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:33.540
If Bill Clinton won,
why did he finish?
Gave Bill Clinton was impeached.

667
00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:37.340
Why did he finish up?
I don't understand how he could have been impeached,

668
00:40:37.341 --> 00:40:39.800
but he did not leave office.
All right.

669
00:40:39.801 --> 00:40:43.460
Being at peach doesn't guarantee the person in peach has to leave office.

670
00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:47.440
Here's some historical examples.
Uh,

671
00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:50.810
the problem with your question is he was not impeached in a way to have to leave

672
00:40:50.811 --> 00:40:52.760
office.
I see.

673
00:40:52.761 --> 00:40:55.640
You really don't understand the difference between impeachment and having to

674
00:40:55.641 --> 00:41:00.140
leave office now.
You didn't have to be that fucking conti about it.

675
00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:04.280
Not True.
He wasn't peached for a public official impeach.

676
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:07.850
While this is just people arguing,
Bill Clinton was acquitted,

677
00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:11.560
the Senate did not reach the two thirds majority needed to fully process is

678
00:41:11.570 --> 00:41:13.640
impeachment.
To further break it down,

679
00:41:13.641 --> 00:41:17.600
Clinton was impeached by the House on two charges.
The first being perjury.

680
00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:20.480
The second being obstruction of justice following this,

681
00:41:20.481 --> 00:41:22.010
he was acquitted by the Senate.

682
00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:23.750
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

683
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:26.960
<v 1>The impeachment process takes place in two steps.
First,</v>

684
00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:30.690
the president has to stick a cigar and somebody pussy.
No,
sorry.

685
00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:34.160
First the president has to be impeached in the of Representatives.

686
00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:38.060
That is the equivalent of an indictment.
Ah.

687
00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:40.610
Then the president is tried in the Senate.
What?

688
00:41:40.611 --> 00:41:43.460
The chief justice of the United States presiding.
Oh,

689
00:41:43.461 --> 00:41:45.110
this is why all the lefties is saying,

690
00:41:45.111 --> 00:41:49.670
we got to fucking kill these elections in October so we can get Trump out.

691
00:41:49.671 --> 00:41:51.260
I was like,
what the fuck are they talking about?

692
00:41:51.261 --> 00:41:56.261
So then they could actually and indict him in the house and then impeach him in

693
00:41:56.901 --> 00:41:57.734
the Senate.

694
00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:58.760
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

695
00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:01.940
<v 1>It requires a two thirds vote of the Senate to removing impeachment.</v>

696
00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:03.530
You think if he got impeached,
right?

697
00:42:03.531 --> 00:42:05.690
If it went to the Senate and he got impeached,

698
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:10.310
like I actually think that he would leave before they took the vote.

699
00:42:10.610 --> 00:42:14.190
He would get on his own fucking plane and he would just leave and he'd be on the

700
00:42:14.191 --> 00:42:18.140
f like just so his ego could handle it.
Like,
you know,

701
00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:21.980
you're not going to come walking in here and have me pack up my shit and have me

702
00:42:21.981 --> 00:42:26.050
escorted out.
Like I just get fought fired at,
you know,
some fucking corporation.

703
00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:27.853
All right.

704
00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:29.060
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

705
00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:29.893
<v 1>I haven't been,</v>

706
00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:33.440
I don't take the amount of time that I take to comb my hair over the top of my

707
00:42:33.441 --> 00:42:36.650
fucking had to be treated this way.
All right.

708
00:42:36.651 --> 00:42:40.040
So evidently they fucking didn't think the guy was down.

709
00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:44.740
I'm literally commentating a game that you already know the results of that

710
00:42:44.741 --> 00:42:48.460
you're not watching.
This is the stupidest fucking thing I've ever done.

711
00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:53.040
All right.
I'll be honest with you.
I'm just,
I'm fucking lonely.
Okay.

712
00:42:53.130 --> 00:42:57.030
I just felt like talking to somebody can,
can you guys just be there for me?

713
00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:01.590
All right.
The fucking fucking guy did his God damn job.
You hit it twice.

714
00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:05.980
Hey,
how about a round of applause for the person who's making the field goal

715
00:43:05.981 --> 00:43:09.100
kickers,
helmets.
Now they finally,
you know,
they gave him like two bars.

716
00:43:10.830 --> 00:43:15.060
You know,
I have back in the day,
they just had that like Fred Cox,
Joe size man.

717
00:43:15.061 --> 00:43:18.750
All those guys just had that one bar across the front of their fucking,

718
00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:25.000
I mean,
I dunno.
I Dunno how those people survived.
All right.
You know,

719
00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:28.870
and this is going to be a mercy pause right here.
I'm going to just wait for the,

720
00:43:28.871 --> 00:43:33.490
all the information to come from my fucking podcast so I can actually do this.

721
00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:37.900
Okay?
Yes.
We'll send over in five getting advertising now.
All right.

722
00:43:37.901 --> 00:43:42.100
I still got advertising.
Um,
all right,

723
00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:43.870
I'll talk to you in two seconds here.

724
00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:45.800
<v 3>Okay.</v>

725
00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:50.330
<v 1>All right.
I'm back and I got all the materials I need here.
By the way,</v>

726
00:43:50.331 --> 00:43:54.890
all went to sate stay fucking scored again.
They were up by one point.

727
00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:57.500
That's where I am in the game.
They just,

728
00:43:57.501 --> 00:44:02.501
Vikings just got a pass interference call with number 19 or some shit on the

729
00:44:02.811 --> 00:44:06.080
vikings who has the smallest shoulder pads I've ever seen in my life.

730
00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:08.990
Remember the eighties how big fucking shoulder pads were?

731
00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:12.830
What do they make those things out now?
I guess if everybody has small ones,

732
00:44:12.831 --> 00:44:17.600
then it's a fucking,
it's a fair game.
Oh,
by the way.

733
00:44:17.601 --> 00:44:18.434
So

734
00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:24.610
basically what happened with Bill Clinton was he got indicted in the House of

735
00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:26.390
Representatives and then when it went to the Senate,

736
00:44:26.650 --> 00:44:30.260
they needed two thirds of the vote and none of the Democrats voted to impeach

737
00:44:30.261 --> 00:44:32.820
him.
So that's how we got off.

738
00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:36.180
The liberals look the other way with the sexual harassment,

739
00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:43.790
and you know,
it's all just politics.

740
00:44:43.791 --> 00:44:46.250
It's not like one side's better than the other.
If it was a Republican,

741
00:44:46.251 --> 00:44:47.200
they would have voted the,
oh,

742
00:44:47.230 --> 00:44:50.000
they all would have voted the exact fucking opposite way except maybe one or two

743
00:44:50.001 --> 00:44:54.860
fucking actually decent human beings.
Um,
and the result.

744
00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:57.020
But,
so Bill Clinton got acquitted,

745
00:44:57.050 --> 00:45:01.040
but he did lose his license to practice law because of that.

746
00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:05.100
They're fucking unbelievable.
Unfuckable Lord of all.

747
00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:09.440
One of the hardest things I think is to become a lawyer.
Just all like,

748
00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:12.110
like trying to pass the bar and all of that.

749
00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:15.440
You go through all of that shit and then what do you do?

750
00:45:15.441 --> 00:45:19.070
You stick a cigar in some fucking woman's pussy.
That is it,

751
00:45:19.071 --> 00:45:22.610
your wife and then you lie about it and then all that study and goes right out

752
00:45:22.611 --> 00:45:25.370
the window.
Jesus Christ.

753
00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:31.360
I love cigars and I love women,
but I'm telling you if I learned anything,

754
00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:33.970
you got to keep them separate.
All right?

755
00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:41.370
Okay,
let's do some advertising here.

772
00:46:39.111 --> 00:46:42.500
I was trying to buy all the fucking Minnesota hit a field goal.

773

Anyways,
I was trying to,

775
00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:55.460
some fucking old lady can't even get up for it.
Um,

776
00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:01.100
I tried to buy a Jersey for my nephew and I filled out where I lived,

And then when I hit process to like,
Eh,

779
00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:10.280
And then they kept all my information,

simply safe.

795
00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:09.280
Studies show that security systems deter burglars.

796
00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:10.720
It's a fact,

797
00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:15.430
but there is still a burglar burglary every eight seconds in America.

798
00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:19.960
Burglars don't give up.
Just because someone's house has a security system,

799
00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:22.750
they find a house that isn't protected.

800
00:48:23.110 --> 00:48:28.110

00:48:48.290 --> 00:48:49.180

That wasn't a tough voice.

822
00:49:42.691 --> 00:49:44.760
You know what I mean?
Somebody just says some crazy shit.

823
00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:46.630
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

00:50:02.911 --> 00:50:05.670
breaking in and then you start talking all this shit like you're in there and

00:51:18.021 --> 00:51:21.230
scale ready for a happier new year.
Ready for happy new year.

852

854
00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:30.630
number three,
Bobby.

855
00:51:30.631 --> 00:51:35.030
A bear if they brought it back from the fucking retirement is loosening up is

856
00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:36.140
what the needs to wear that number.

857
00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:38.860
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

858
00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:43.310
<v 1>he's fucking loosening up his leg here to kick a fucking field goal,</v>

859
00:51:43.311 --> 00:51:47.930
which would win it.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Was My prediction true?

860
00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:51.620
Are these poor viking fans going to get fucked again?

861
00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:55.250
Are they going to be crying at the mall of America?
How much?

862
00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:58.220
How many yards does he need?
They need like another 15 yards.

863
00:51:59.830 --> 00:52:02.230
<v 0>Oh.
Oh,</v>

864
00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:07.850
<v 1>okay.
Here we go.
The Vikings are one play away
and let's,</v>

865
00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:12.550
this guy comes in and just kits like a fucking 70 yarder.
Oh,

866
00:52:12.551 --> 00:52:16.240
you gotta catch that?
You got to catch that.

867
00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:17.740
<v 5>Okay.</v>

868
00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:22.600
<v 1>Hey,
fuck.
I want to throw it was right there.
Drew Brees.</v>

869
00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:27.100
Ah God.
The coach has on his reading glasses.
He's already in the f off season.

870
00:52:28.210 --> 00:52:32.510
It's going to read catcher in the rye or some shit.
Come on,
man.

871
00:52:33.050 --> 00:52:36.060
Come on drove.
Why do I give a shit?
I,

872
00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:38.150
the Vikings have had a drought of the states.

873
00:52:38.330 --> 00:52:41.450
One in 2010 I just want to be right.
I said the states are going to win.

874
00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:46.130
I apologize to everybody in Minneapolis,
Saint Paul Duluth.

875
00:52:46.370 --> 00:52:48.020
Oh No.

876
00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:52.190
First down fucking fuck the sates.

877
00:52:53.090 --> 00:52:55.130
Oh my God,
I have to turn this up.

878
00:52:58.120 --> 00:52:59.500
Oh my God.

879
00:53:01.370 --> 00:53:06.230
He's in the guys feel goal rage.
Oh No,
no.
You know it's funny.

880
00:53:06.231 --> 00:53:09.830
I Love Minneapolis.
I don't want you people to be sad.
I was just joking around.

881
00:53:12.050 --> 00:53:15.890
Oh,
case and puts the hat on,
takes it off,
puts it on,
holds his head.

882
00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:21.230
How am I ever going to talk to my loved ones again?
Holy Shit.

883
00:53:21.890 --> 00:53:24.770
Ten nine eight Jesus Christ through,
what are we doing?

884
00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:29.580
I learned from Tony Romo was the play clock.
You fucking moron.
All right.

885
00:53:29.581 --> 00:53:32.370
40 seconds to go was like Jesus.
He's nonchalant.

886
00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:37.260
I learned from Tony Romo.
You want to,
you want to kick it with four seconds left.

887
00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:37.560
Just,

888
00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:41.430
I think it's four seconds left cause then you don't have to kick off like that's

889
00:53:41.431 --> 00:53:42.930
how long it feel gold takes.

890
00:53:43.970 --> 00:53:44.280
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

891
00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:47.880
<v 1>but with Tony Romo after it's done,
Bob Lynn and it probably takes 11 seconds.</v>

892
00:53:47.881 --> 00:53:49.860
I'll come on.
He shits on Deion Sanders.

893
00:53:49.861 --> 00:53:52.560
I can give him a little fucking rough time.
I love Tony Romo,
by the way.

894
00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:56.610
All right.
Practice tea.
All right.
You kicked it.
Okay.

895
00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:58.290
I put it into the net.

896
00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:04.550
37 seconds to go.
Oh my God.
Is this

897
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:07.730
the mall of America?
Oh God.

898
00:54:07.731 --> 00:54:10.550
Why didn't I invest in the Kleenex store at the mall of America?

899
00:54:11.330 --> 00:54:12.980
One of the dumbest things I ever did.

900
00:54:13.010 --> 00:54:17.010
Blitz and drew Brees fucking picked it up.

901
00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:21.880
It's a catch.
Oh,
I'm going to talk so much shit to Diversey.

902
00:54:23.410 --> 00:54:27.450
I'm going to talk so much shit.
Diversey yeah.
What did I say?
I called it.

903
00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:31.330
Oh,
he's the ball was bobbling.
Yeah,
he got it.
He got it.

904
00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:36.220
Did he catch it enough times for it to be a kid and all that.
Dot.
Not not,
no.

905
00:54:36.221 --> 00:54:39.490
That's not a catch.
The little tail was hanging down on the bottom.

906
00:54:40.510 --> 00:54:42.430
See now here go.
Here goes all the fucking drama.

907
00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:44.920
This is going to be 20 fucking minutes of this shit.
All right.

908
00:54:44.950 --> 00:54:46.870
I'm not even looking at this guy damn game at this point.

909
00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:51.660
That is not a catch of Vikings.
C'Mon.
You gotta throw the challenge flag.

910
00:54:53.090 --> 00:54:55.290
Did the vikings coach just come from the gun range?

911
00:54:55.291 --> 00:55:00.280
What is with those goddamn glasses?
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah.

912
00:55:01.690 --> 00:55:02.050
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

913
00:55:02.050 --> 00:55:06.010
<v 1>You can see the point of the ball touches the ground are right there.</v>

914
00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:10.420
Yeah.
It's not a catch.
Everybody knows.

915
00:55:10.421 --> 00:55:14.200
It's not a catch for the fucking love of Christ.
All right.

916
00:55:14.201 --> 00:55:17.770
This is just hilarious.
The first letter that I got this week,

917
00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:19.120
there's the water guy.

918
00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:21.610
Now how did he know the guy wanted the water down his back when?

919
00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:24.390
That'd be annoying.
Tba.

920
00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:27.650
Fuck is the name of this one dear Billy Bo's.
Huh?

921
00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:32.250
I had been a big fan of the podcast and you stand up for several years now.

922
00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:36.390
I am writing you to tell you that I owe you a lot.
Oh Jesus,
look good.

923
00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:38.430
This was about a year ago.

924
00:55:38.490 --> 00:55:42.240
I heard you first say that every now and then you would look into the mirror and

925
00:55:42.241 --> 00:55:46.400
call yourself a tub of fuck
I do.

926
00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:51.150
I thought it was hilarious and it made me realize I was a tub of fuck as well.

927
00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:54.360
Look at that.
We're bonded.
Um,

928
00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:55.580
<v 5>okay.</v>

929
00:55:55.580 --> 00:55:59.380
<v 1>Fucking sound.
ICLOUD preferences.
I don't know my password and you won't give it.</v>

930
00:55:59.390 --> 00:56:02.240
You won't get me a second chance so I don't want to update it.
All right.

931
00:56:02.241 --> 00:56:03.500
Since last February,

932
00:56:03.530 --> 00:56:07.400
I have woken up every morning and told myself that I am a tub of fuck.

933
00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:09.350
I made my phone wallpaper,

934
00:56:09.351 --> 00:56:14.351
a picture of me when I was at my heaviest two 55 so whenever I unlock my phone

935
00:56:15.621 --> 00:56:19.240
there was a reminder of the tub of fuck I am and no longer wanted to beat.

936
00:56:19.250 --> 00:56:24.040
That's great.
I'm proud to announce that I have lost 70 pounds in

937
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:26.770
<v 4>11 months.
Dude,
that's awesome.</v>

938
00:56:26.771 --> 00:56:31.120
And honestly I owe you a big thanks for giving me the motivation to do this

939
00:56:31.121 --> 00:56:35.470
because of you and Joe Rogan.
Probably more Joe Rogan.
He's actually had shape.

940
00:56:35.471 --> 00:56:38.800
I have done a lot of things in the last year that have taken me out of my

941
00:56:38.801 --> 00:56:42.910
comfort zone.
You've been a great inspiration in my life in many different ways.

942
00:56:42.911 --> 00:56:47.080
Hope you and the lovely meal and the baby have a great 2018 from one tub of fuck

943
00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:49.990
to another.
Go Fuck Yourself.
Well,
that was just,
you know,

944
00:56:49.991 --> 00:56:54.340
for all you guys know that I wrote that there was really no question there after

945
00:56:54.850 --> 00:56:59.630
failure of you.
Did he say that was a catch?

946
00:57:02.580 --> 00:57:03.420
What?

947
00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:09.850
How the fuck was that a catch?
You saw the little cone to the ball.

948
00:57:11.690 --> 00:57:15.150
Ks.
Kingdom cannot grow a beard,
goddammit.
He's trying.

949
00:57:18.050 --> 00:57:19.760
What the fuck?

950
00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:26.590
Oh my God.
Everybody's got on their granny glasses.

951
00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:31.990
All right,
drew Brees.
What's he gonna do?

952
00:57:31.991 --> 00:57:35.680
He's gonna get a hands off the fucking ball and nothing happens,

953
00:57:35.681 --> 00:57:36.790
but he didn't fumble it.

954
00:57:37.930 --> 00:57:38.190
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

955
00:57:38.190 --> 00:57:39.670
<v 4>All right.
You guys want to listen to this shit?</v>

956
00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:44.170
Do you want to listen to the sound of a bunch of 80,000 people have already

957
00:57:44.171 --> 00:57:48.760
started crying to go to the mall of America?
If I ran the mall of America,

958
00:57:48.761 --> 00:57:53.690
I would say free rollercoaster rides for the entire month.
Yeah.

959
00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:56.710
Well maybe for the week.
You know,
they've gotta make that money over there.

960
00:57:56.990 --> 00:57:57.970
I can't imagine how much,

961
00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:01.013
<v 3>Oh my God.</v>

962
00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:04.530
<v 4>How does this always happen to the fucking vikings?</v>

963
00:58:04.531 --> 00:58:07.620
It always happens to them when they're at home.
Everything with like 15 in one.

964
00:58:08.490 --> 00:58:08.600
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

965
00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:10.520
<v 4>The dirty birds came in and it just,</v>

966
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:12.380
<v 3>okay.</v>

967
00:58:12.380 --> 00:58:14.000
<v 4>Somehow came in and fucking beat him.</v>

968
00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:17.690
It's unreal.
Done.

969
00:58:17.690 --> 00:58:21.090
Then they have a game against like the fucking Redskins or something like that

970
00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:25.830
and 88 well they had the game won and then it just fucking went away.

971
00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:29.300
Ah,
Jesus Christ.

972
00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:30.860
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

973
00:58:30.860 --> 00:58:33.530
<v 4>All right,
here we go.
Bobby a bears.</v>

974
00:58:34.860 --> 00:58:35.150
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

975
00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:39.860
<v 4>Fucking lining up for the kick.
The kick is up plow and it's good.</v>

976
00:58:40.070 --> 00:58:41.690
Oh No.

977
00:58:43.170 --> 00:58:44.003
<v 3>Yes.</v>

978
00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:47.870
<v 4>Oh.
When the saints go marching in,</v>

979
00:58:49.250 --> 00:58:50.810
Oh my God,

980
00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:56.270
the game is not over cause they got case Keenum

981
00:58:58.310 --> 00:58:59.750
what the fuck?

982
00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:03.530
I'm already typing in capital letters to Paul Versey.

983
00:59:04.130 --> 00:59:07.340
What the fuck did I say?
What did I say?

984
00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:13.940
<v 3>All right.
Let me turn this down.
What did I do to the fucking thing?</v>

985
00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:16.730
Is there an exit button?
Exit?

986
00:59:18.010 --> 00:59:19.840
<v 4>Holy fucking shit.</v>

987
00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:26.600
<v 1>I can't,
I can't fucking believe they came back and won this game.</v>

988
00:59:29.060 --> 00:59:31.100
I do.
I just say,
you know,
I don't know shit about football.

989
00:59:31.101 --> 00:59:34.220
I just had a feeling sad to feeling.
I was like drew Brees.

990
00:59:34.290 --> 00:59:39.020
He's like third all time passing.
He never gets the respect he fucking deserves.

991
00:59:39.021 --> 00:59:41.330
I think he's got,
I said it last week on the podcast.

992
00:59:43.690 --> 00:59:47.270
I'm texting Paul Versey right fucking now Paul for Z.

993
00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:53.500

996
01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:04.660

Numb to them winning.

997
01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:08.200
Sorry.
What the fuck?
I mean,
they did a bunch for Aaron.
Judge.

998
01:00:08.201 --> 01:00:11.980
I can't have fun with case kingdoms name.
That's what I'm going to do someday.

999
01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:14.230
You know,
when I retire from being a comedian,

1000
01:00:14.231 --> 01:00:17.800
I'm going to go straight headlines for sports pages,

1001
01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:19.863
you know,

1002
01:00:20.110 --> 01:00:23.680
and I'll finally get to do all my pun jokes that I'm not allowed to do in a

1003
01:00:23.681 --> 01:00:25.840
comedy.
You do a Pun joke in a comedy club,

1004
01:00:25.870 --> 01:00:28.780
you're going to get a grown and people get you do enough of,

1005
01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:32.680
and people going to ask for their fucking money back.
All right.
The Daily News,

1006
01:00:32.681 --> 01:00:36.060
the New York Post,
all of these guys,
they live on it.
Uh,
I'll,
I'll fall.

1007
01:00:36.061 --> 01:00:40.970
Start false start.
Everybody's pointing at everybody else.

1008
01:00:41.030 --> 01:00:44.780
A little disco dancing on the Vikings.

1009
01:00:46.790 --> 01:00:50.480

01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:54.530
He's probably still get cereal in there.
Oh,

1011
01:00:55.130 --> 01:00:56.090
That's not the way you went.

1012
01:00:56.091 --> 01:00:58.130
That's not the way you want to start your two minute offense.

1013
01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.540
I like the Vikings when I was a kid,

1014
01:01:03.690 --> 01:01:07.020
cause purple was my favorite color when I was a little kid.
I wanted to,

1015
01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:10.770
I wanted to be a painter now,
like of art.
I would just wanted to paint houses.

1016
01:01:10.771 --> 01:01:15.120

that would be a cool job.
And uh,
all right.

1017
01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:19.170
Prevent defense there on the 38 yard line.
Don't take it.
Dump Penalty.

1018
01:01:21.290 --> 01:01:22.123
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1019
01:01:22.830 --> 01:01:24.080
<v 1>Um,

1020
01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:28.260
I just wanted to paint houses and I was going to paint everybody's house purple

1021
01:01:28.261 --> 01:01:30.360
whether they liked it or not.
Cause that was my favorite color.

1022
01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:37.480
So right out of the gate,
you know I was a con.

1023
01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:44.450
Um,

1024
01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:47.330

<v 1>Dude,
I fucking called it called.</v>

1029
01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:06.860
It's why is it so much fun being right about sports?

1030
01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:09.590
It's probably cause you s you know,
I'm so wrong in the rest of my life.

1031
01:02:10.190 --> 01:02:13.160
Just feels good.
Every once in a while incomplete.

1032
01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:16.970
It only took fucking two seconds off.
All right.
You know,

1033
01:02:16.971 --> 01:02:17.780
this is going to be boring.

1034
01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:21.180
The amount of time this is going to fucking let me read the next God damn

1035
01:02:21.181 --> 01:02:25.080
question.
Is it going to be another love letter?

1038
01:02:30.801 --> 01:02:34.950

thing.

1039
01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:40.140
He said get an instant pot and you could make steel cut oats in like three to

1040
01:02:40.141 --> 01:02:43.860

Oh,

1058
01:03:37.101 --> 01:03:41.450

Maybe the instant pot is fucking ripping them off.

1059
01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:46.900
All right.
What is it?
It's balling young.

That's what it is.
Instapot is

1065
01:04:06.951 --> 01:04:09.020

1066
01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:12.110
You like how this person was just trying to help me out?

1067

1076
01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:53.120
Oh my God.

1078
01:04:58.341 --> 01:04:59.174
happened.

1079
01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:04.340
How do you let that happen?

1080
01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:08.150
Holy Shit.
All right.

1081
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:11.750
Wait on fucking believable.

1082
01:05:14.690 --> 01:05:17.560
<v 1>Oh,

I didn't say the thing.
When I've texted to [inaudible],</v>

1083
01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:20.470
<v 4>I almost said,
dude,
I fucking call that.</v>

1084
01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:25.000
How did that fucking just happen on the last play of the game

1085
01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:29.670
and that he missed them and knocked his own guy down?

1086
01:05:34.370 --> 01:05:36.560
You have to be fucking kidding me.

1087
01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:40.550
I've literally seen it all.

1088
01:05:43.350 --> 01:05:45.540
I cannot fucking believe that just happened.

1089
01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:53.840
Are you fucking kidding me?

1090
01:05:59.430 --> 01:06:01.620
Exactly.
Case Keenum Oh my God.

1091
01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:08.200
I just saw it when the guy caught it.
I was like,
holy fuck.

1092
01:06:08.201 --> 01:06:09.790
Are they going to have time to kick a field goal?

1093
01:06:15.250 --> 01:06:16.930
Why won't anybody hug case keep them

1094
01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:25.050
look at the wide receiver.
Acted like he just did something to me.

1095
01:06:25.051 --> 01:06:25.801
He caught the ball,

1096
01:06:25.801 --> 01:06:30.450
but the that saints completely fucked up the act like he faked out that guy.
He,

1097
01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:33.153
<v 3>wow.</v>

1098
01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:38.120
<v 4>Oh my God.
I don't know what the name of that St is,
but I got to fill in.</v>

1099
01:06:38.121 --> 01:06:41.750
Everybody's going to know that name by tonight.
Holy Shit.

1100
01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:50.890
I cannot fucking believe that just happened.

1101
01:06:56.670 --> 01:06:59.410
That was another med.
When drew Pearson caught that fucking ball.

1102
01:07:00.310 --> 01:07:03.640
The Vikings are finally on the right side of one of these place.

1103
01:07:05.870 --> 01:07:07.610
Holy Shit.

1104
01:07:13.230 --> 01:07:16.710
Oh my God,
I cannot fucking believe.
I cannot fucking believe that just happened.

1105
01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:22.650
That was unbelievable.
Happy for Minnesota,

1106
01:07:22.651 --> 01:07:25.350
but Jesus Christ's sad for the saints.

1107
01:07:27.050 --> 01:07:28.420
What the fuck now?

1108
01:07:28.450 --> 01:07:33.440
How if you're that guy in the saints that missed the guy completely,

1109
01:07:33.470 --> 01:07:37.250
didn't even put your fucking arms out and then took out another player.

1110
01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:40.310
How do you go into that locker room?
What do you say?

1111
01:07:42.870 --> 01:07:44.310
What the fuck do you say?

1112
01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:48.310
<v 3>Oh my God.</v>

1113
01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:53.870
<v 4>What are the fucking odds?
I was going to be watching this game the entire time.</v>

1114
01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:57.630
Oh Jesus.
Now the rest got look reviewing the score.
It's a,

1115
01:08:01.930 --> 01:08:05.080
he didn't step out of bounds.
Don't take this away from football fans.

1116
01:08:05.590 --> 01:08:09.370
Don't take this away.
What did he do?
He just put his head down.

1117
01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:14.420
That's like some pop Warner shit.

1118
01:08:17.220 --> 01:08:18.360
Oh my God.

1119
01:08:21.090 --> 01:08:22.590
Ruling a field is confirmed.

1120
01:08:23.490 --> 01:08:23.790
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

1121
01:08:23.790 --> 01:08:26.090
<v 4>the ref taken a lot of time here.
He never gets cheered.</v>

1122
01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:36.280
We must kick the field goal.
I just shut it off.

1123
01:08:36.310 --> 01:08:38.200
I cannot wait a minute.
I've got to leave it on.

1124
01:08:38.201 --> 01:08:41.620
What if they fucking block it and score score.
Fucking touchdown.
Right?

1125
01:08:42.450 --> 01:08:46.310
I got to leave that on.
I can't,

1126
01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:50.930
I don't believe what I just saw.
I cannot fucking believe that.

1127
01:08:50.931 --> 01:08:51.860
How many times have I said that?

1128
01:08:57.290 --> 01:08:59.150
That was fucking unbelievable.

1129
01:09:04.730 --> 01:09:08.450
How do I follow this up with questions?
I just did all of that.

1130
01:09:08.451 --> 01:09:12.380
Now my next question,
do you miss the Prius?
I swear to God.
That's the question.

1131
01:09:15.230 --> 01:09:16.063
<v 3>MMM.</v>

1132
01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:18.490
<v 4>Oh No,
they're going to clear the field.</v>

1133
01:09:19.490 --> 01:09:20.180
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

1134
01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:23.360
<v 4>we have to fucking kick the extra point.
The saints are gone.</v>

1135
01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:27.180
Now they've got to come out of the locker room.
Um,

1136
01:09:27.290 --> 01:09:29.390
can you imagine if the gouge is fuck that play up,

1137
01:09:29.790 --> 01:09:32.120
block this extra point and ran it back for a touchdown.

1138
01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:37.080
That would be like watching a tosh point.
Oh.

1139
01:09:37.110 --> 01:09:41.010
Like you know when he has the people be able to do the redemptions without

1140
01:09:41.011 --> 01:09:45.360
needing tosh point.
Oh,
it'd be a self contained episode.

1141
01:09:47.010 --> 01:09:48.450
Um,
alright.
Hang on a second.

1142
01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:52.030
Let me fucking get my password in here.

1143
01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:57.010
Let me read this Prius thing while we're waiting.
Ah,

1144
01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:59.930
okay.
Do you miss the Prius?
What up Billy Buick?

1145
01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:04.340
I actually love a Buick back in the day.
I love Buicks.
You know when,

1146
01:10:04.341 --> 01:10:07.370
when a Cadillac was a Cadillac and Buick was like,
you know,

1147
01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:08.930
you weren't quite a Cadillac guy.

1148
01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:12.910
I wonder if this would have put them at least in field goal range,

1149
01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:18.200
the worst fucking attempt ever at a fucking,

1150
01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:21.890
the fact that that guy is a safety.

1151
01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:26.630
Oh my God,

1152
01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:34.370
I don't fight.
I just,
I know I've seen a lot of shit.

1153
01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:36.680
I seen a lot of shit.

1154
01:10:39.150 --> 01:10:41.610
What the fuck anyways.
Do you?

1155
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.823
<v 3>Hmm.</v>

1156
01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:46.620
<v 4>I know you're thrifty for years while driving your Prius built.</v>

1157
01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:49.890
I was wondering if you still like driving a nicer vehicle,

1158
01:10:49.891 --> 01:10:54.180
a regret spending the money.
I'm in the recovery from buying new vehicles.

1159
01:10:54.181 --> 01:10:58.160
I wasted money for years on new cars and never really got any satisfaction from

1160
01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:02.160
it.
The past three years I've been driving a 2007 Honda accord.
Awesome.

1161
01:11:02.370 --> 01:11:06.240
And surprisingly,
I'm pretty happy with it.
Yeah,
dude,
once you get it paid off,

1162
01:11:06.241 --> 01:11:09.870
it's a shit.
I still have to fight the urge to buy a new ride often anyways.

1163
01:11:09.871 --> 01:11:14.290
Happy New Year from down in Alabama.
Um,

1164
01:11:16.370 --> 01:11:19.650
uh,
no,
cause I didn't buy a nice car until I could afford one.

1165
01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:21.450
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1166
01:11:21.450 --> 01:11:23.130
<v 4>Uh,
that's a mistake.
A lot of people do,</v>

1167
01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:27.480
you know that trying to get some lady's attention or whatever the fuck it is or

1168
01:11:27.481 --> 01:11:31.230
they just love cars so much.
Like if you're really,
really a car guy,

1169
01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:33.570
understand like along the way you're going to have like nice cars.

1170
01:11:33.571 --> 01:11:38.571
But I was always about paying off my house and getting the bankers off my uh,

1171
01:11:40.350 --> 01:11:44.130
back.
I was into that shit.
This is what's fucked up is the saints right now.

1172
01:11:44.131 --> 01:11:47.700
They have a chance,
very small chance,

1173
01:11:47.701 --> 01:11:49.320
but they have a chance don't they,

1174
01:11:52.170 --> 01:11:54.450
to block the extra point and return it for a touchdown.

1175
01:11:54.690 --> 01:11:58.680
Can't that fucking happen?
Um,
anyways,
yeah,

1176
01:11:58.681 --> 01:11:59.970
I was always,

1177
01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:05.720
I was always way into no debt or working my way towards having no debt.

1178
01:12:07.050 --> 01:12:11.430
Like,
um,
I,

1179
01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:14.490
I just,
I can't stress that enough to young people,

1180
01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:18.600
but when you get like a credit card and all that shit,
it's just like be,

1181
01:12:18.650 --> 01:12:23.650
be really careful with those things and you can't like,

1182
01:12:25.190 --> 01:12:29.520
um,
oh,
this is smart.
They're just going to go for a 2.0 version.

1183
01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:33.500
It just down the ball.
So that can't happen.
There you go.
That's smart.

1184
01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:37.520
My dumb ass.
That's why I don't coach on any level.
Um,

1185
01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:41.030
anyways.
The um,

1186
01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:45.930
yeah,
I was,
I just was always in delight,

1187
01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:49.980
just not being in debt,
you know,

1188
01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:55.040
it just absolutely paralyzes you and it affects your ability to go after what

1189
01:12:55.951 --> 01:12:57.720
you want to go after.
I've told this story before,

1190
01:12:57.721 --> 01:13:01.170
like I kept a day job until I moved to New York the first three and a half
years.

1191
01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:05.550
I was a comedian probably the last year.

1192
01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:09.270
Well,
actually it's not true cause I was still living at home with my parents.

1193
01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:13.530
I could have basically,
um,

1194
01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:15.013
<v 3>okay,</v>

1195
01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:18.280
<v 4>you know,
said,
hey,
can you help support me with my dream?</v>

1196
01:13:18.281 --> 01:13:21.400
And I could have just been sitting around the house,
so just making comedy money.

1197
01:13:21.970 --> 01:13:26.470
But I continued to work and before I moved down in New York,

1198
01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:28.030
I paid off everything.

1199
01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:30.370
<v 0>MMM.</v>

1200
01:13:30.370 --> 01:13:34.990
<v 4>I paid off my student loans.
I paid off my car,</v>

1201
01:13:34.991 --> 01:13:37.030
which died right before I went to New York.

1202
01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:42.310
And I saved up a chunk of money and I just moved down to New York.
And,
uh,

1203
01:13:42.311 --> 01:13:43.780
I was never a ramen noodle guy,

1204
01:13:43.781 --> 01:13:47.290
but I definitely ate a lot of fucking rig Etonians Spaghetti and shit.

1205
01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:50.193
<v 0>MMM.</v>

1206
01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:56.020
<v 4>And I just did that.
So,
um,
when I finally got it,</v>

1207
01:13:56.050 --> 01:13:57.760
when I finally bought myself a nice car,

1208
01:13:57.761 --> 01:14:02.680
I could afford it and felt like I earned it.
And um,
yeah,

1209
01:14:02.740 --> 01:14:07.120
I loved it.
But I also love the Prius.
The Prius is a fucking great car,
you know,

1210
01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:12.160
cheapest shit to fucking own.
It's never a problem.
You Park it whatever you want.

1211
01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:15.970
<v 1>No one's trying to steal a fucking Prius.
You know,
I always joked like,</v>

1212
01:14:15.971 --> 01:14:17.890
you don't want,
mine was like eight or nine years old.

1213
01:14:17.891 --> 01:14:21.670
I literally could leave that thing on with the door open in the middle of a

1214
01:14:21.671 --> 01:14:25.840
fucking,
you know,
riot and no one would take it.
Like,
you know,
you know,

1215
01:14:26.110 --> 01:14:29.180
whenever they do the trap car,
I tried to get people to steal that car.
They,

1216
01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:29.800
they've never,

1217
01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:32.980
I will be willing to bet they never did that with the fucking Prius.

1218
01:14:33.310 --> 01:14:36.670
Now I want to know how many of those Viking fan stuck around.
You know,

1219
01:14:36.671 --> 01:14:37.870
some people left,

1220
01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:42.880
you know that they fucking left and as they were winding down the fucking
stairs,

1221
01:14:42.881 --> 01:14:45.700
they just start every going,
oh my God.
Oh my God.

1222
01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:49.000
Then they had to fucking run their fat asses back up there.

1223
01:14:49.001 --> 01:14:52.030
Congratulations to the vikings.
Holy Shit.

1224
01:14:56.110 --> 01:14:57.820
The Vikings did not win that game.

1225
01:14:57.850 --> 01:15:01.990
That was a the biggest fuck up I have seen

1226
01:15:03.730 --> 01:15:05.440
in a long goddamn time.
Ah,

1227
01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:08.410
drew Brees and once again drew Brees to silent assassin.

1228
01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:11.770
Nobody knows how good that guy is and now he's not going to get to prove it in

1229
01:15:11.771 --> 01:15:16.330
the NFC championship game.
Potentially try to win a super bowl tragedy.
All right.

1230
01:15:16.331 --> 01:15:20.740
Bulletproof glass bullshit.
A dear Billy dad bought,
you know,

1231
01:15:20.741 --> 01:15:21.640
that hurts.

1232
01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:25.690
I was listening to your podcast a while back where you read someone's email

1233
01:15:25.691 --> 01:15:30.691
concerning owning a store with a bulletproof glass where his grandfather was

1234
01:15:31.871 --> 01:15:36.871
almost killed and he was outraged at the mandate and claimed the person pushing

1235
01:15:36.971 --> 01:15:40.660
the bill said,
bulletproof windows are racist.

1236
01:15:41.050 --> 01:15:43.660
I just wanted to point out that it was bullshit.

1237
01:15:43.690 --> 01:15:47.790
Most people in this country who get outraged over things,

1238
01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:49.980
they're oftentimes just misinformed.

1239
01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:55.230
And because we live in a consumer culture where the customer is always right.
No,

1240
01:15:55.231 --> 01:15:56.064
they're not.

1241
01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:57.750
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

1242
01:15:57.750 --> 01:15:59.910
<v 1>that's old school.
The customer is not right.</v>

1243
01:15:59.911 --> 01:16:03.480
The customer can go fuck themselves and talk to a fucking robot on the phone.

1244
01:16:04.350 --> 01:16:05.460
If you're bleeding to death,

1245
01:16:05.790 --> 01:16:10.650
press to the mindset has transitioned to politicians saying the citizens are

1246
01:16:10.651 --> 01:16:14.700
hardworking,
honest,
honorable Americans rather than saying the truth.

1247
01:16:14.701 --> 01:16:19.200
Most citizens are ignorant and titled Tribal,
both tribal mouth breathers.

1248
01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:22.020
Sir,
I don't know at what point in political history,

1249
01:16:22.050 --> 01:16:24.780
politicians were saying that.
They never said that either.

1250
01:16:24.781 --> 01:16:28.950
So you're kind of speaking in hyperbole,
I believe as the expression.
Uh,

1251
01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:32.400
but I understand what you're saying.
Um,
you're trying to build up your point.

1252
01:16:32.730 --> 01:16:37.050
This is the bill that was proposed regarding bulletproof windows.
Um,

1253
01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:39.710
I am not fucking reading all of that.
Uh,

1254
01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:42.930
it's regarding restaurants and no other places of business.

1255
01:16:42.931 --> 01:16:46.980
So that person that wrote you in fear of having his bulletproof glass band is

1256
01:16:46.981 --> 01:16:51.410
basically an outrage over nothing.
Oh,

1257
01:16:51.411 --> 01:16:53.660
in outraged,
you know,
in outrage,
you mean?
No.

1258
01:16:53.690 --> 01:16:56.780
D It doesn't even affect him or his grandfather.
Well,
that's good.

1259
01:16:57.170 --> 01:16:58.730
It was never called racist.

1260
01:16:58.790 --> 01:17:02.660
We want to make sure that there isn't this sort of indignity,

1261
01:17:02.930 --> 01:17:03.800
in my opinion,

1262
01:17:04.070 --> 01:17:08.930
to serving food through a Plexiglas only in certain neighborhoods.

1263
01:17:11.950 --> 01:17:15.860
What?
That doesn't make sense.

1264
01:17:17.020 --> 01:17:17.320
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1265
01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:19.120
<v 1>Well who are you to say it's indignant?</v>

1266
01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:20.690
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1267
01:17:20.690 --> 01:17:23.280
<v 1>Ah,
you know what?
That's,
that's sneaky writing right there.</v>

1268
01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:28.680
You're going to get offended for people.
I don't understand what's going on here.

1269
01:17:28.681 --> 01:17:30.990
I don't know.
It was never called racist.

1270
01:17:32.690 --> 01:17:36.170
We want to make sure that there isn't this sort of indignity,
in my opinion,

1271
01:17:36.171 --> 01:17:40.430
to serving food through a Plexiglas only in a certain neighborhoods.
Well,

1272
01:17:40.431 --> 01:17:43.250
whenever I was doing gigs and bad neighborhoods and they had that fall,

1273
01:17:43.550 --> 01:17:46.880
can bulletproof glass,
I always looked at it.
Okay,
heads up.

1274
01:17:46.910 --> 01:17:49.880
Keep your head on a swivel.
I appreciated it being there.

1275
01:17:49.910 --> 01:17:51.290
I didn't feel like fucking,

1276
01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.930
I dunno what you tried to do here,
but I,

1277
01:17:57.931 --> 01:18:00.650
I am in favor of hurting some people's feelings.

1278
01:18:00.651 --> 01:18:04.400
If it keeps people who want to just have the honest job of working at a

1279
01:18:04.401 --> 01:18:07.520
restaurant alive.
Um,

1280
01:18:07.521 --> 01:18:11.210
I would be in favor of it and I don't think it's Plexiglas.
Is it?

1281
01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:16.430
Plexiglass stops a bullet.
I don't fuck it though.
Um,

1282
01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:20.210
that's from Philadelphia.
Council woman,
Cindy Bass.

1283
01:18:21.390 --> 01:18:25.820
All right,
let's look up Cindy Baz.
Cindy can be your friend.

1284
01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:29.330
Three 10.
She's your fucking council man.

1285
01:18:30.530 --> 01:18:33.200
Why does it always take me to fucking Wikipedia now?

1286
01:18:37.170 --> 01:18:41.350
What the fuck?
Where are we Cindy bass images.

1287
01:18:42.900 --> 01:18:43.733
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1288
01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:46.910
<v 1>Cindy Bass appears to be African American.
All right,</v>

1289
01:18:46.911 --> 01:18:49.220
so this person was saying that she was being racist.
Now,

1290
01:18:49.221 --> 01:18:51.950
according to some people,
it's impossible for a black person to be ready.

1291
01:18:51.980 --> 01:18:55.640
I don't even know what the fuck is going on right now.
I don't know.

1292
01:18:56.120 --> 01:19:00.500
All I know is if I worked in a Goddamn restaurant and somebody nearby had shot

1293
01:19:00.501 --> 01:19:03.320
someone in a restaurant to the point that somebody felt that they needed to be

1294
01:19:03.321 --> 01:19:06.710
some fucking glass up there,
uh,
I would want it.

1295
01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:10.310
But who the fuck am I to say what people need in their,
in their neighborhood?

1296
01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:16.010
Well,
how the fuck did I get signed out of that thing?
Hey,

1297
01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:19.950
when it's signed you out as it goes,
do you want to make a report?
No,

1298
01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:23.190
I don't have time for that shit.
Like,
who has time to do that?

1299
01:19:23.650 --> 01:19:27.510
I'm always trying to do poor kids.
Oh,
so no showing dope.

1300
01:19:29.940 --> 01:19:31.040
Um,
it was never called cable.

1301
01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:35.130
While I still don't agree that any type of business should be mandated to remove

1302
01:19:35.131 --> 01:19:38.010
a type of security for whatever it was.

1303
01:19:38.011 --> 01:19:43.011
Websites like steadfast and loyal.com that wrote bulletproof glass is now racist

1304
01:19:45.061 --> 01:19:47.760
in their title.
However,
you know what,

1305
01:19:47.761 --> 01:19:49.140
I actually understand what you're saying here.

1306
01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:53.250
Cause that type of shit happens to comedians all the time where they just,

1307
01:19:53.251 --> 01:19:55.620
you know,
they float something out there,
Huffington Post,

1308
01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:58.980
and then they try to get you in trouble or make it more sensationalized so they

1309
01:19:58.981 --> 01:20:03.030
can get views.
Uh,
however,
in the body of the article,

1310
01:20:03.031 --> 01:20:05.820
they admitted that the council woman never used those words.

1311
01:20:05.821 --> 01:20:10.380
But of course most people read beyond this article.
Yeah,
see,

1312
01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:13.830
I mean that's the Internet.
There's really no,
uh,

1313
01:20:14.550 --> 01:20:18.990
there's no libel.
There's no,
there's none.
I cannot fucking,

1314
01:20:20.150 --> 01:20:21.360
I got to hear what this guy said.

1315
01:20:31.050 --> 01:20:33.690
God cared.
God cared that this Guy Yeps God cared.

1316
01:20:33.691 --> 01:20:37.810
The other guy had too much devil in him and Debbie other that the safety on the

1317
01:20:37.811 --> 01:20:40.000
saints.
He prayed to the devil.
That's what happened.

1318
01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:44.920
And the devil misled to tackle air to tackle his own fucking teammate.
Uh,

1319
01:20:45.130 --> 01:20:48.230
I know you're a comedian and not some fucking political correspondents,

1320
01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:51.340
so it's not like I'm trying to hold you up to some Barbara Walters type of

1321
01:20:51.341 --> 01:20:51.791
standard,

1322
01:20:51.791 --> 01:20:55.150
but I know some people in your audience forget that and believe everything they

1323
01:20:55.151 --> 01:20:59.230
read in everything they hear that feeds into what they already believe.

1324
01:20:59.231 --> 01:21:01.870
Like you said,
I am right.com.
Yeah,
well,
dude,

1325
01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:06.240
nobody's coming to this fucking website to become informed.
Okay.
Um,

1326
01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:08.980
don't put that on me.
Okay.
I did not pursue that,

1327
01:21:09.250 --> 01:21:11.580
which is why I became a comedian.
All right.

1328
01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:17.920
I tried to Siri,
the serious world.
It didn't fucking work out for me.

1329
01:21:17.921 --> 01:21:21.190
I failed miserably.
Okay.
Failed my wife.

1330
01:21:22.690 --> 01:21:24.580
All right,
dear Billy buddy guy,

1331
01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:26.830
my wife and I had been married for a year and a half.

1332
01:21:26.831 --> 01:21:31.831
We both have a child from prior relationships and a seventh month old daughter

1333
01:21:32.141 --> 01:21:34.720
together.
She's an angel by the way.
Of course she is.

1334
01:21:35.050 --> 01:21:39.430
She is Latina and I only bring that up because she fits all the fiery

1335
01:21:39.431 --> 01:21:43.000
stereotypes,
both good and bad.
She completes my life with this.

1336
01:21:43.030 --> 01:21:45.790
Although arguments can get very difficult.

1337
01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:48.020
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1338
01:21:48.020 --> 01:21:50.090
<v 1>Dude,
I thought you were talking about your seven month old.</v>

1339
01:21:51.110 --> 01:21:53.400
It's fucking hilarious.
You went right into that.
I thought you're good.

1340
01:21:53.450 --> 01:21:56.890
You already have an arguments with a seven month old and she's fiery,

1341
01:21:58.370 --> 01:22:03.350
blah blah blah blah.
Fucking talking.

1342
01:22:03.351 --> 01:22:05.750
Jibberish okay.
Your wife.
Okay.

1343
01:22:05.751 --> 01:22:08.930
She's Latina and I only bring that up because she fits all these stereotypes.

1344
01:22:08.931 --> 01:22:10.640
She completes my life.
Oh Blah blah blah.

1345
01:22:10.970 --> 01:22:15.970
I have some of the same temper issues that you use to describe yourself and your

1346
01:22:16.131 --> 01:22:21.110
bit about kneeling on the ball when I'm right is paid off huge.
Uh,

1347
01:22:21.111 --> 01:22:22.310
so thank you for that.
Yeah,

1348
01:22:22.311 --> 01:22:25.160
I wish I should probably rewatch that bit cause I have not been doing that

1349
01:22:25.161 --> 01:22:27.230
lately.
I've been Aaron it out.

1350
01:22:27.770 --> 01:22:32.770
Anyway to cut to the chase we decided together to fight for primary custody of

1351
01:22:33.351 --> 01:22:37.880
my son.
The case is very complicated,
but for the sake of everyone listening,

1352
01:22:37.881 --> 01:22:40.460
I'll summarize it with his few details as possible.

1353
01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:43.340
In family court before peering in front of a judge,

1354
01:22:43.341 --> 01:22:48.341
there is a conference where immediate mediator tries everything they can to make

1355
01:22:48.381 --> 01:22:51.530
sure you can come to an agreement and avoid a judge.
Deciding,

1356
01:22:51.950 --> 01:22:56.950
my wife and I had a plan going in to not cut a deal with my ex at the conference

1357
01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:01.880
and hold out for a judge to rule on custody.
However,

1358
01:23:01.881 --> 01:23:06.220
I had no idea the level of pressure that they'd be able to on me and I buckled

1359
01:23:06.221 --> 01:23:09.100
under it and made a deal for the next year.

1360
01:23:09.490 --> 01:23:13.060
Then I had to go home and explain to my wife that I had failed our plan.

1361
01:23:13.450 --> 01:23:15.790
I don't know if you've ever completely disappointed your woman,

1362
01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:18.670
but this is the worst feeling in the world.
Well,
wait a minute.

1363
01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:23.440
She's going to judge you because they probably used your love of your own kid

1364
01:23:24.460 --> 01:23:27.540
right against you.
Anyways,

1365
01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:31.660
and as you can imagine over the past day or so,
she's cutting me into me.

1366
01:23:32.070 --> 01:23:36.520
It's just about every opportunity for all the little failures and I can see it

1367
01:23:36.550 --> 01:23:41.470
right in and arise that are man had a moment of weakness and didn't come through

1368
01:23:41.471 --> 01:23:42.250
in the clutch.

1369
01:23:42.250 --> 01:23:47.250
Worse is that she absolutely hates my ex and feels like I let her get the better

1370
01:23:47.771 --> 01:23:52.180
of me.
US.
Yeah.
You know,
kind of feeling.
Yeah.

1371
01:23:53.950 --> 01:23:56.860
Okay.
All right.
Oh Geez.
You're in the middle of that.

1372
01:23:56.861 --> 01:23:58.210
You're in the middle of the two ladies.

1373
01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:02.110
You have ever disappointed you a woman with a grand fuck up about every three

1374
01:24:02.111 --> 01:24:02.770
days.

1375
01:24:02.770 --> 01:24:06.910
I guess a good boxing analogy is that my hands are down and I don't know how

1376
01:24:06.911 --> 01:24:10.810
long to let her continue jabbing at me until I put them back up.
Thanks.

1377
01:24:10.811 --> 01:24:15.040
And Go fuck yourself.
Uh,
I wouldn't take another ounce of shit from her.

1378
01:24:16.270 --> 01:24:16.680
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1379
01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:19.440
<v 1>I,
you need to sit down and talk to her and be like,
wait a minute.</v>

1380
01:24:19.830 --> 01:24:23.280
I'm trying to get my kid back.
I'm going back with all of this emotion.
Wait,

1381
01:24:23.281 --> 01:24:24.240
let me make sure this is,

1382
01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:30.590
you decided together to get primary custody of your son.
Now,
who's idea was that?

1383
01:24:30.591 --> 01:24:35.591
Was that totally yours or was the hatred your wife has of your ex wife played

1384
01:24:36.711 --> 01:24:39.080
into the thing?
Um,

1385
01:24:41.940 --> 01:24:44.220
I,
I don't know,
Dude.
I don't know what's going on,

1386
01:24:44.221 --> 01:24:48.860
but it sounds when it went into my head.
Okay,

1387
01:24:48.861 --> 01:24:50.030
now no notice.
No.

1388
01:24:50.031 --> 01:24:54.500
That everything that you say is now perverted cause went into my brain.
As I say,

1389
01:24:54.501 --> 01:24:56.750
once you say something,
it's not what you said anymore.

1390
01:24:57.200 --> 01:24:59.210
It's cut with the other person's experiences.

1391
01:24:59.211 --> 01:25:02.300
It's like drugs that have been stepped on.
What you said was pure cocaine.

1392
01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:07.130
Now it's in my head and this all this [inaudible] fucking laxatives getting

1393
01:25:07.131 --> 01:25:11.910
fucking put in it.
Um,
all I hear is that your wife,
uh,

1394
01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:18.430
your current wife resents your previous fucking wife and uh,

1395
01:25:18.740 --> 01:25:21.550
she's doing that woman thing where they don't solve things with their fists.

1396
01:25:21.580 --> 01:25:23.140
They try to fucking make,

1397
01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:27.010
they just do that thing where they tried to make the other woman as miserable as

1398
01:25:27.011 --> 01:25:30.670
they possibly can and she knows probably how much it would break.

1399
01:25:31.260 --> 01:25:31.610
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1400
01:25:31.610 --> 01:25:35.210
<v 1>Your ex,
why is hard to lose a primary custody of your son?</v>

1401
01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:38.660
And she really wanted to do that to her because that would make her feel better

1402
01:25:38.661 --> 01:25:40.730
and more secure in your relationship.
I don't fucking know.

1403
01:25:40.731 --> 01:25:44.210
I have no idea to this too many fucking variables here.
But um,

1404
01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:49.190
I wouldn't take it out of shit if I had a son from a previous marriage and you

1405
01:25:49.191 --> 01:25:49.311
know,

1406
01:25:49.311 --> 01:25:52.130
I was trying to do what you were doing and then I caved under that pressure.

1407
01:25:52.370 --> 01:25:55.340
My wife would understand it and if she ever gave me shit,

1408
01:25:55.400 --> 01:26:00.400
I would be stunned and then I would fucking read her the riot act and I would go

1409
01:26:00.501 --> 01:26:03.980
out to a bar and have a couple of cold ones there.
That's what I do.
Okay.

1410
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:06.340
Now I get into a lot of arguments in my relationships.

1411
01:26:06.450 --> 01:26:10.700
We probably don't want to listen to me.
I have no professional background.
Okay.

1412
01:26:11.090 --> 01:26:14.210
I'm the type of man that once that already types out,
dude,

1413
01:26:14.211 --> 01:26:18.530
I called it with 25 seconds left in fucking jinx is the saints.

1414
01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:21.380
Maybe it was my fault.
Um,
