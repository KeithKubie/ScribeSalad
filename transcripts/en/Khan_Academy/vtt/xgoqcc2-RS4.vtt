00:00:00.644 --> 00:00:02.002
- [Voiceover] We're asked to subtract

00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:05.067
negative two x squared
plus four x minus one

00:00:05.067 --> 00:00:09.757
from six x squared plus
three x minus nine,

00:00:09.757 --> 00:00:11.406
and like always I encourage
you to pause the video

00:00:11.406 --> 00:00:13.797
and see if you can give it a go.

00:00:13.797 --> 00:00:16.096
All right, now let's work
through this together.

00:00:16.096 --> 00:00:20.020
So I could rewrite this as six x squared

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.514
plus three x minus nine

00:00:23.514 --> 00:00:28.321
minus, minus this
expression right over here,

00:00:28.321 --> 00:00:29.905
so I'll put that in parentheses,

00:00:29.905 --> 00:00:34.895
minus negative two x squared,
negative two x squared

00:00:34.895 --> 00:00:39.130
plus four x minus one.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.999
Now what can we do from here?

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:43.263
Well, we can distribute
this negative side,

00:00:43.263 --> 00:00:45.562
we can distribute this negative side,

00:00:45.562 --> 00:00:47.141
and then if we did that,

00:00:47.141 --> 00:00:50.184
we would get the six x squared
plus three x minus nine

00:00:50.184 --> 00:00:51.774
won't change so we still have that.

00:00:51.774 --> 00:00:56.464
Six x squared plus three x minus nine,

00:00:56.464 --> 00:00:59.064
but if I distribute the negative side,

00:00:59.064 --> 00:01:01.445
the negative of negative two x squared

00:01:01.445 --> 00:01:04.730
is positive two x squared.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.841
So that's going to be positive two...

00:01:07.841 --> 00:01:09.304
Get a little more space.

00:01:09.304 --> 00:01:13.274
Positive two x squared, and then subtract,

00:01:13.274 --> 00:01:15.875
and then the negative
of positive four x is...

00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:18.221
I'm going to subtract four x now,

00:01:18.221 --> 00:01:20.692
and then the negative of negative one,

00:01:20.692 --> 00:01:23.513
or the opposite of negative one
is going to be positive one.

00:01:23.513 --> 00:01:26.114
So I've just distributed
the negative side,

00:01:26.114 --> 00:01:29.910
and now I can add terms
that have the same degree

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.763
on our x...

00:01:31.763 --> 00:01:33.871
The same degree terms,
I guess you could say,

00:01:33.871 --> 00:01:37.337
so I have an x squared term,

00:01:37.337 --> 00:01:38.945
here it's six x squared,

00:01:38.945 --> 00:01:41.290
here I have a two x squared term,

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:42.660
so I can add those two together,

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.401
six x squared plus two x squared.

00:01:44.401 --> 00:01:46.583
If I have six x squareds
and then I have another

00:01:46.583 --> 00:01:49.869
two x squareds, how many x
squareds am I now going to have?

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.048
I'm now going to have eight
x squareds, eight x squareds,

00:01:54.048 --> 00:01:56.169
or six x squared plus two x squared.

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:58.433
We add the coefficients,
the six and the two

00:01:58.433 --> 00:02:00.824
to get eight, eight x squared.

00:02:00.824 --> 00:02:04.324
Then we can add the x terms.

00:02:04.324 --> 00:02:06.212
You could view these as
the first-degree terms,

00:02:06.212 --> 00:02:08.120
three x...

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.615
We have three x

00:02:11.615 --> 00:02:14.135
and then we have minus four x,

00:02:14.135 --> 00:02:16.189
so three x minus four x,

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:18.244
if I have three of something
and I take away four of them,

00:02:18.244 --> 00:02:20.891
I'm now going to have
negative one of that thing,

00:02:20.891 --> 00:02:22.470
or you could say that the coefficients,

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.339
three minus four would be negative one.

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:26.730
So I now have negative one x.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.739
I could write it as negative one x,

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.784
but I might as well just
write it as negative x.

00:02:31.784 --> 00:02:33.858
That's the same thing as negative one x.

00:02:33.858 --> 00:02:36.679
And then finally, I can deal
with our constant terms.

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:40.603
I'm subtracting a nine
and then I'm adding a one.

00:02:40.603 --> 00:02:43.447
So you could say, "Well, what's
a negative nine plus one?"

00:02:43.447 --> 00:02:45.340
Well, that's going to be negative eight.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.535
That's going to be negative
eight and we are all done.

00:02:49.535 --> 00:02:52.514
And one thing that you
might find interesting

00:02:52.514 --> 00:02:56.519
is I had a polynomial here and from that

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.322
I subtracted another polynomial,

00:02:58.322 --> 00:03:00.957
and notice, I got a polynomial,

00:03:00.957 --> 00:03:04.062
and this is actually always
going to be the case.

00:03:04.062 --> 00:03:07.354
If you think about the
set of all polynomials,

00:03:07.354 --> 00:03:08.550
if you just think about the set...

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.536
Let me do this in a neutral color.

00:03:10.536 --> 00:03:12.022
So if we think about the set

00:03:12.022 --> 00:03:14.495
of all polynomials right over here,

00:03:14.495 --> 00:03:16.329
and if you take one polynomial,

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.452
which you could imagine
this magenta polynomial.

00:03:19.452 --> 00:03:21.193
So this is a polynomial right over here,

00:03:21.193 --> 00:03:24.322
let's call this p of x.

00:03:24.322 --> 00:03:27.299
So this is p of x right over there,

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.305
p of x, and then you
have another polynomial,

00:03:32.325 --> 00:03:34.929
this one right over here, let's call this,

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:38.203
I don't know, we can call this q of x,

00:03:38.203 --> 00:03:40.443
q of x, just for kicks.

00:03:40.443 --> 00:03:43.833
So that's q of x, just like that.

00:03:43.833 --> 00:03:45.586
And if you apply the...

00:03:45.586 --> 00:03:48.693
In this case, we applied
the subtraction operator.

00:03:48.693 --> 00:03:50.450
If we apply subtraction...

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.097
So you took these two,
you took these two...

00:03:53.097 --> 00:03:55.395
Let me see how I could depict this well.

00:03:55.395 --> 00:04:00.132
So we took p of x and you
subtracted from that q of x.

00:04:00.132 --> 00:04:02.561
We still get a polynomial,

00:04:02.561 --> 00:04:04.106
so that's going to give us...

00:04:04.106 --> 00:04:06.995
We stay in the set of polynomials.

00:04:06.995 --> 00:04:09.479
At any time you have a set of things,

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:11.267
and you might be more
used to talking about this

00:04:11.267 --> 00:04:13.100
in terms of integers,

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.944
or number sets, but you can
talk about this in general.

00:04:16.944 --> 00:04:18.685
Here we're talking about
the set of polynomials,

00:04:18.685 --> 00:04:21.123
and we just saw that if we
start with two polynomials,

00:04:21.123 --> 00:04:23.117
two members of the set of polynomials...

00:04:23.117 --> 00:04:25.316
Let me be clear, this is polynomials,

00:04:25.316 --> 00:04:28.245
polynomials, right over here.

00:04:28.245 --> 00:04:29.844
You take two members of the set

00:04:29.844 --> 00:04:32.534
and you perform the subtraction operation,

00:04:32.534 --> 00:04:35.695
you're still going to
get a member of the set.

00:04:35.695 --> 00:04:37.871
And when you have a situation like this,

00:04:37.871 --> 00:04:39.411
I could call this one,

00:04:39.411 --> 00:04:40.467
I don't know, I'm running out of letters.

00:04:40.467 --> 00:04:42.394
Well let me just call this one f of x,

00:04:42.394 --> 00:04:44.437
so we've got f of x here.

00:04:44.437 --> 00:04:45.746
When you have this
situation where you take

00:04:45.746 --> 00:04:48.280
two members of a set, you
apply an operator on them,

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.451
or you take a certain
number of members of a set,

00:04:50.451 --> 00:04:51.391
you apply an operator on them,

00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:52.842
and you still get a member of the set,

00:04:52.842 --> 00:04:57.649
we would say that this set is
closed under that operation.

00:04:57.649 --> 00:05:00.297
So we could say that the set

00:05:00.297 --> 00:05:04.325
of polynomials, set of polynomials,

00:05:05.428 --> 00:05:08.662
polynomials closed,

00:05:09.863 --> 00:05:11.094
closed...

00:05:11.094 --> 00:05:12.188
I won't even put it in quotes.

00:05:12.188 --> 00:05:16.288
Closed under, under subtraction.

00:05:16.288 --> 00:05:19.244
And I didn't prove it here,
I just did one example

00:05:19.244 --> 00:05:21.520
where I subtracted two polynomials

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.586
and I got another one,

00:05:22.586 --> 00:05:25.464
and there's clearly more
rigorous proofs that you can do.

00:05:25.464 --> 00:05:27.043
But this is actually the
case, as long as you have

00:05:27.043 --> 00:05:28.985
two polynomials, you apply subtraction,

00:05:28.985 --> 00:05:32.236
you're going to get another polynomial.

00:05:32.236 --> 00:05:35.289
And the fancy way of saying
that is the set of polynomials

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:37.123
is closed under subtraction.

00:05:37.123 --> 00:05:39.352
This notion of closure
sometimes seems like this

00:05:39.352 --> 00:05:42.464
very fancy mathematical
idea, but it's not too fancy.

00:05:42.464 --> 00:05:43.822
It's just you take two members of a set,

00:05:43.822 --> 00:05:45.018
you apply an operation,

00:05:45.018 --> 00:05:46.515
if you still get a member of the set

00:05:46.515 --> 00:05:49.543
after that operation,
then that set is closed

00:05:49.543 --> 00:05:51.538
under that operation.
