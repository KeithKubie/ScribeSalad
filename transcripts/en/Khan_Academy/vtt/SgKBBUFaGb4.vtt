00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.830
We're asked to solve for p.

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.640
And we have the inequality
here negative 3p minus 7

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.640
is less than p plus 9.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.180
So what we really want
to do is isolate the p

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.937
on one side of this inequality.

00:00:10.937 --> 00:00:12.770
And preferably the
left-- that just makes it

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:13.570
just a little easier to read.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.160
It doesn't have to be, but we
just want to isolate the p.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.020
So a good step to
that is to get rid

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.490
of this p on the
right-hand side.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.410
And the best way I can
think of doing that

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.247
is subtracting p from the right.

00:00:23.247 --> 00:00:24.830
But of course, if
we want to make sure

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.140
that this inequality is
always going to be true,

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.880
if we do anything to
the right, we also

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.170
have to do that to the left.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.770
So we also have to
subtract p from the left.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.500
And so the left-hand side,
negative 3p minus p--

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.000
that's negative 4p.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.760
And then we still have
a minus 7 up here-- is

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.000
going to be less than p minus p.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.080
Those cancel out.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.120
It is less than 9.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.300
Now the next thing
I'm in the mood to do

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.670
is get rid of this
negative 7, or this minus

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.830
7 here, so that we
can better isolate

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.540
the p on the left-hand side.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.960
So the best way I can think
of to get rid of a negative 7

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.160
is to add 7 to it.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.750
Then it will just
cancel out to 0.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.920
So let's add 7 to both
sides of this inequality.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.959
Negative 7 plus 7 cancel out.

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:07.720
All we're left with
is negative 4p.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.710
On the right-hand side, we
have 9 plus 7 equals 16.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.690
And it's still less than.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.770
Now, the last step
to isolate the p

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.870
is to get rid of this
negative 4 coefficient.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.900
And the easiest way I
can think of to get rid

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.750
of this negative
4 coefficient is

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.810
to divide both
sides by negative 4.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.792
So if we divide this
side by negative 4,

00:01:27.792 --> 00:01:29.250
these guys are
going to cancel out.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.708
We're just going
to be left with p.

00:01:30.708 --> 00:01:32.680
We also have to do it
to the right-hand side.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.130
Now, there's one thing that
you really have to remember,

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.800
since this is an
inequality, not an equation.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.660
If you're dealing
with an inequality

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.830
and you multiply or divide
both sides of an equation

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.640
by a negative number, you
have to swap the inequality.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.250
So in this case, the less
than becomes greater than,

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.400
since we're dividing
by a negative number.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.710
And so negative 4 divided by
negative 4-- those cancel out.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.870
We have p is greater than
16 divided by negative 4,

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.290
which is negative 4.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.480
And we can plot this
solution set right over here.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.080
And then we can
try out some values

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.289
to help us feel good about
the idea of it working.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.680
So let's say this is negative
5, negative 4, negative 3,

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.637
negative 2, negative 1, 0.

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:19.220
Let me write that a
little bit neater.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.220
And then we can keep
going to the right.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.100
And so our solution is p is
not greater than or equal,

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.060
so we have to
exclude negative 4.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.240
p is greater than negative 4,
so all the values above that.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.110
So negative 3.9999999 will work.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.490
Negative 4 will not work.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.370
And let's just try
some values out

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.740
to feel good that this is
really the solution set.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.790
So first let's try out when
p is equal to negative 3.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.184
This should work.

00:02:50.184 --> 00:02:52.100
The way I've drawn it,
this is in our solution

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.120
set. p equals negative 3
is greater than negative 4.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.300
So let's try that out.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.020
We have negative 3
times negative 3.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.900
The first negative
3 is this one,

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.650
and then we're saying
p is negative 3.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.111
Minus 7 should be less
than-- instead of a p,

00:03:06.111 --> 00:03:07.610
we're going to
putting a negative 3.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.000
Should be less than
negative 3 plus 9.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.030
Negative 3 times
negative 3 is 9,

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.070
minus 7 should be less than
negative 3 plus 9 is 6.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.180
9 minus 7 is 2.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.430
2 should be less than 6,
which, of course, it is.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.400
Now let's try a value that
definitely should not work.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.690
So let's try negative 5.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.510
Negative 5 is not
in our solution set,

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.080
so it should not work.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.170
So we have negative 3
times negative 5 minus 7.

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.860
Let's see whether it is
less than negative 5 plus 9.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.940
Negative 3 times negative
5 is 15, minus 7.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.380
It really should not be
less than negative 5 plus 9.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.720
So we're just seeing if p
equals negative 5 works.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.230
15 minus 7 is 8.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.520
And so we get 8 is
less than 4, which

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.730
is definitely not the case.

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.910
So p equals negative
5 doesn't work.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.494
And it shouldn't work, because
that's not in our solution set.

00:04:05.494 --> 00:04:07.493
And now if we really want
to feel good about it,

00:04:07.493 --> 00:04:09.170
we can actually try
this boundary point.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.550
Negative 4 should
not work, but it

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.536
should satisfy the
related equation.

00:04:13.536 --> 00:04:15.160
When I talk about
the related equation,

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.750
negative 4 should satisfy
negative 3 minus 7

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.060
is equal to p plus 9.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.240
It'll satisfy this, but
it won't satisfy this.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.630
Because when we get the
same value on both sides,

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.160
the same value is not
less than the same value.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.250
So let's try it out.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.690
Let's see whether
negative 4 at least

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.870
satisfies the related equation.

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.190
So if we get negative 3
times negative 4 minus 7,

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.870
this should be equal
to negative 4 plus 9.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.370
So this is 12 minus 7 should
be equal to negative 4 plus 9.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:49.480
It should be equal to 5.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.688
And this, of course, is true.

00:04:50.688 --> 00:04:52.560
5 is equal to 5.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.360
So it satisfies the
related equation,

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.760
but it should not satisfy this.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.910
If you put negative
4 for p here--

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.390
and I encourage you to do so.

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.848
Actually, we could
do it over here.

00:05:00.848 --> 00:05:03.010
Instead of an equals
sign, if you put it

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.090
into the original inequality--
let me delete all of that--

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.960
it really just becomes this.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.650
The original inequality
is this right over here.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.730
If you put negative
4, you have less than.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.470
And then you get 5 is less
than 5, which is not the case.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:19.950
And that's good,
because we did not

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.460
include that in
the solution set.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:22.780
We put an open circle.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.020
If negative 4 was included,
we would fill that in.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.978
But the only reason why
we'd include negative 4

00:05:26.978 --> 00:05:28.650
is if this was
greater than or equal.

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.650
So it's good that this does
not work, because negative 4

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.540
is not part of our solution set.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.640
You can kind of view
it as a boundary point.
