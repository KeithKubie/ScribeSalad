00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.926
In today's video,

00:00:00.926 --> 00:00:04.250
we are going to be showing you
some experiments using gallium,

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:05.680
aluminum, and acid.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:13.320
[Music]

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.880
We've done some fun experiments
with gallium in the past,

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:18.162
including making some
little Lego men,

00:00:18.162 --> 00:00:20.700
full gallium copy of my face,

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.620
and we've just melted it down,
and played with it.

00:00:22.635 --> 00:00:25.135
Today, we want to look
at a little bit more of some

00:00:25.135 --> 00:00:26.735
of the chemistry behind gallium,

00:00:26.735 --> 00:00:28.700
and how it reacts
with some other stuff.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.806
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:29.806 --> 00:00:31.656
We are going to be
taking our gallium,

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.540
and we are going to be putting
it through a few basic tests

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.700
to show you just
how different it is.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.740
So gallium is the element 31,

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.700
and it's actually in
the same family of some metals

00:00:40.717 --> 00:00:42.747
that you may be familiar
with, like aluminum,

00:00:42.747 --> 00:00:44.521
but there are
some vast differences.

00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:46.460
We want to show you
what some of those are.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.660
Most famously, gallium
has a melting temperature

00:00:49.668 --> 00:00:51.850
that is way lower than aluminum,

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.360
and lower than almost
any other metal.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.880
This cast of my face
is probably about 60%

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:58.960
of all of the gallium we have,

00:00:58.973 --> 00:01:01.474
maybe more, and we need it
for some experiments.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.280
So this, unfortunately,
is now going to get destroyed.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:15.040
[Music]

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.050
My face is now melted.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.816
So we've got plenty
of liquid gallium to play with.

00:01:18.816 --> 00:01:20.698
Let's see what we
can do with it.

00:01:20.698 --> 00:01:22.069
Gallium melts to a liquid

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:24.047
at about 85 and 1/2
degrees Fahrenheit,

00:01:24.047 --> 00:01:26.205
which is about 29 and
1/2 degrees Celsius.

00:01:26.205 --> 00:01:26.771
This gallium,

00:01:26.771 --> 00:01:27.756
which was on the stove,

00:01:27.756 --> 00:01:29.423
even though it was
on its lowest setting is

00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:31.100
quite a bit warmer than that,

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.507
hot enough that it's
a little bit uncomfortable

00:01:32.507 --> 00:01:34.720
to stick our hands in
for any extended period of time,

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.720
but we can still do it
for just a second,

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.591
and you can see
how it reacts and moves.

00:01:38.591 --> 00:01:39.550
So some people think

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.269
that gallium is toxic
or not safe to handle,

00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:43.712
that's simply not true.

00:01:43.712 --> 00:01:46.161
Mercury, which looks
very similar is,

00:01:46.161 --> 00:01:48.240
but gallium, as
far as we know,

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.660
it's just fine.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.571
And when she says we,

00:01:50.571 --> 00:01:53.250
she doesn't mean we
didn't do any research.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.350
We as in all tests indicate
that metallic gallium is safe.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.873
One note, although it's

00:01:58.873 --> 00:02:02.446
not toxic, it does have a
tendency to stain a little bit,

00:02:02.446 --> 00:02:04.350
like it just
leaves some residue.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.467
Well, we don't feel

00:02:05.467 --> 00:02:08.067
like we need to be wearing
gloves for safety reasons.

00:02:08.067 --> 00:02:10.420
We do like wearing gloves
for staining reasons.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.500
This should come out
with just soap and water though.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.380
Soda cans are
made from aluminum,

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.150
and aluminum reacts
interestingly with gallium.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.150
We're going to do an experiment
to show that effect.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.750
So the aluminum
can has like paint,

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.050
and it has a coating on it

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.482
so that your drink is absorbing
aluminum as you drinking it.

00:02:25.482 --> 00:02:27.550
So what we're going to do is
we're going to sand the bottom

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:28.550
of this can a little bit,

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.924
we're going to pour some of
our molten gallium into a bowl,

00:02:30.924 --> 00:02:32.874
and we're going to set
the can in there,

00:02:32.874 --> 00:02:34.550
and we're going to let
it sit for a while,

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.671
and see what it does.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.240
Aluminum usually has
an oxide layer on it,

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.480
even when it's not painted.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.740
Now, that actually keeps it
from reacting with water

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:42.960
and other things,

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.700
but it's also going to keep it
from reacting to the gallium.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.440
So not just the paint,

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.550
but the oxide layer
itself has to come off,

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:49.950
and then you'll actually see

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.680
how quickly it
will soak that up.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.460
Perfect.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.580
We're going to place
that on the stove,

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.240
in the spot
that keeps it warm,

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.416
and just let it sit and absorb.

00:03:00.416 --> 00:03:03.002
This right here is
some aluminum mesh.

00:03:03.002 --> 00:03:04.770
Useful for a lot of things,
but right now,

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.582
we're just going
to use it because...

00:03:06.582 --> 00:03:08.152
&gt;&gt; It's aluminum.
&gt;&gt; It's aluminum.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.140
Regular sheet of aluminum foil.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.680
You can tear it.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.600
It tears fairly easily,

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.700
but it also doesn't
just fall apart.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.979
Nothing's happened to it.

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:20.652
However, take a little bit
of the gallium.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.100
We got a little bead out there.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.380
I'm just going to spread
that around on the surface.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.400
[Music]

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.260
Just destroyed.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.200
This soda can has now

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.380
been sitting in this gallium
for quite a while.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.860
We actually left a soda can
in the gallium overnight,

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.500
and so it's really had
a chance to absorb a lot.

00:03:43.782 --> 00:03:46.480
The gallium did actually
solidify at one point,

00:03:46.488 --> 00:03:48.662
so it wasn't necessarily
sitting in there

00:03:48.662 --> 00:03:50.338
like constantly overnight

00:03:50.338 --> 00:03:52.350
because it only has the effect

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.750
when gallium is actually liquid
and can be absorbed.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.800
So it's several hours worth,

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.640
and and there's already some
deformations that have happened.

00:03:59.653 --> 00:04:00.503
You can actually,

00:04:00.503 --> 00:04:02.153
if you can see
into the can, well,

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.460
if you can see along the side,

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.460
this entire side of the can
is just shattered.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.716
Also, you can see
that the can is shorter.

00:04:08.716 --> 00:04:11.487
Like this can is raised
up higher at the bottom,

00:04:11.487 --> 00:04:13.555
but it's still lower
down than this one.

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:15.503
Our can is just,
I think melting down.

00:04:15.532 --> 00:04:16.650
I want to try and--

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.362
I'm going to try and pick it up.

00:04:18.362 --> 00:04:20.220
The bottom is like--

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.780
Oh, the bottom just tore open

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.520
when it caught on this other
piece of aliminum.

00:04:23.534 --> 00:04:24.849
Okay.
So this is interesting.

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:26.053
Where that air bubble was,

00:04:26.053 --> 00:04:27.582
where we couldn't
actually get it.

00:04:27.582 --> 00:04:30.250
&gt;&gt; The very bottom still ##--
&gt;&gt; The very bottom is just fine,

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.200
because there was an air bubble
protecting it from the gallium.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.540
So this is an aluminum can,

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.652
with about the structural
integrity of aluminum foil.

00:04:39.652 --> 00:04:42.204
Maybe a little, yeah,
less than aluminum foil.

00:04:42.204 --> 00:04:43.945
And it's not just where it was.

00:04:43.945 --> 00:04:47.436
You can see that it was cracking
all the way up the edges,

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.560
and this is just tearing
as I touch it like newspaper.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.480
There it goes.

00:04:52.972 --> 00:04:53.605
RIght there.

00:04:53.605 --> 00:04:54.292
So this...

00:04:54.292 --> 00:04:56.100
This what were pulling
off right now,

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.250
I think is the plastic coating

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.100
that's on the inside
of aluminum cans,

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.490
which is now
also soaking gallium.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:03.592
So it looks like metal.

00:05:03.592 --> 00:05:04.704
But this right here,

00:05:04.704 --> 00:05:07.776
so has now had
that coating removed.

00:05:07.776 --> 00:05:10.454
So this is just aluminum,
that's soaked up gallium.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.320
It wasn't in direct
contact in the bottom,

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.020
but just falls to pieces.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.460
Oh, man.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.760
I mean, a normal aluminum
can isn't hard to crunch,

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.811
but it doesn't fall
into pieces like that just did.

00:05:26.811 --> 00:05:29.548
And most of that
can wasn't in the gallium,

00:05:29.548 --> 00:05:31.501
it was just connected to it,

00:05:31.501 --> 00:05:34.850
and it just drinks
the gallium up into the metal.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.797
All right, aluminum mesh.

00:05:36.797 --> 00:05:40.499
Down where it was in contact
is just falling apart.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.120
Aluminum reacts to water.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.640
We had a lot of aluminum
sitting in here.

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:45.300
I want to know

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.400
if this gallium will now react
to water even just a little bit.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.450
Let's pour a drop
of water in, and see

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:51.682
if it does anything.

00:05:52.992 --> 00:05:54.112
Damn.

00:05:54.112 --> 00:05:56.532
This gallium soaked
up so much aluminum,

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.760
it's now reacting to water.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.640
Now, if you saw our experiments
before when we

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.000
were dripping the gallium
into a glass of water,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.126
it wasn't doing anything.

00:06:04.126 --> 00:06:05.737
It was just sort of pebbling up.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.080
This is not gallium
supposed to do.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.380
This is the aluminum.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.260
So for our next test,
we are actually going

00:06:10.267 --> 00:06:12.090
to try something
that we have seen before.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.940
It's called the
Gallium Beating Heart.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.050
Now, you take about 2 grams
worth of gallium.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.120
You drop it into sulfuric acid.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.840
Then you introduce a metal rod.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.240
It has to be an iron rod,

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.140
and when you do that,

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.460
it causes the gallium to expand
and contract so fast,

00:06:24.468 --> 00:06:26.400
it actually looks
like a beating heart.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.230
So we've got

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.550
our six more concentration
of sulfuric acid here,

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.240
which has been warming
up gently on the stove.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.220
It should be warm enough

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.141
that it will melt are
two pieces of gallium,

00:06:36.141 --> 00:06:38.850
which will then for ito beads,
which will then join together.

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:40.972
We'll start with one,
just in case.

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:46.320
[Music]

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.350
So the hydrogen is still
coming off of this,

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:50.665
but as soon as I touch it
with a piece of iron,

00:06:50.665 --> 00:06:52.265
the gallium itself should relax.

00:06:52.265 --> 00:06:53.642
That's we want to have happen.

00:06:53.642 --> 00:06:54.402
Soon as I let go,

00:06:54.402 --> 00:06:56.827
it's going to contract,
and we want to see that change.

00:06:56.827 --> 00:06:57.449
There you go.

00:06:57.449 --> 00:06:59.067
You can see the bead is moving.

00:06:59.067 --> 00:07:00.700
It's not just
being pushed by the iron,

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.180
it's actually reacting
to the iron.

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.350
It's running away from it.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:06.760
I'm not moving, guys.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.300
It's doing that on its own.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.080
[Music]

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.420
Okay, so this is kind of cool.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:14.900
As soon as he does
that, you can see

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.740
that the whole piece
of gallium relaxes.

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.250
So that's what's happening here.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:19.640
I think I said it
a few times already,

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.240
but it's contracting
and relaxing.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.800
The iron is actually
causing it to relax?

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:28.340
So what's causing

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:30.126
that little beating
heart is that...

00:07:30.126 --> 00:07:31.650
Iron comes in contact with it,

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:33.378
which makes it relax
just a little bit,

00:07:33.378 --> 00:07:35.298
but it relaxes out
from under the iron,

00:07:35.298 --> 00:07:37.048
so it's no longer
touching the iron,

00:07:37.048 --> 00:07:38.122
and so it beats back up.

00:07:38.122 --> 00:07:40.450
And then it beats back up
and touches the iron again,

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:43.150
and the whole cycle just starts
and goes over and over.

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:45.705
Which is also why
we're able to push it around

00:07:45.705 --> 00:07:47.360
without even really touching it.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.800
Another test we're gonna try is
this rather solid aluminum bar.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.257
We'll just sand this
down a little bit,

00:07:55.257 --> 00:07:56.686
and sit in our warm gallium.

00:07:56.686 --> 00:07:57.620
In this one,

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.492
we're actually going
to let go for a while.

00:07:59.492 --> 00:08:02.649
This is going to be heating up
on our stove for about two days,

00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:05.680
because I really want to give
it a chance soaked through.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:06.380
Okay.

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:08.220
Well, we actually pulled
a cooking show trick,

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.980
and we didn't put this in,
and let it sit live right now.

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:15.800
I've put one of these bars
into some gallium two days ago,

00:08:15.802 --> 00:08:17.050
and now, we're showing

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:18.943
you what happens
when you pull it out.

00:08:18.943 --> 00:08:21.400
But it really has been sitting
for two days so...

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:28.700
That completely intact aluminum
bar got eaten away a lot.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.320
Before and after.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.760
These were exactly
the same length too.

00:08:32.812 --> 00:08:35.050
So one thing I do want
to test is the strength.

00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:37.110
I don't know how this one
will hold up to this one.

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:38.540
So I'm just going
to take a hammer.

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:39.850
I'm gonna hit this one
for a control test,

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:41.837
and then I hit this one and see
if it's any different.

00:08:41.837 --> 00:08:42.850
I haven't done this before,

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:44.382
so I'm not sure
how it's going to go.

00:08:44.382 --> 00:08:51.280
[Music]

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.950
It slightly dented it.

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:54.320
That's about all.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.140
Let's try it with this one.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:59.840
[Music]

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.140
Oh, well, it...

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:04.100
It wasn't as fragile as I
thought it was going to be,

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.040
but it is definitely
still coming apart.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.880
It looks like
metallic tree bark.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:13.960
That's kind of coolest,
like aluminum core.

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:18.300
Very organic looking
texture on it.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.500
More robust than I thought
it was going to be,

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:25.162
but this is not what happens
to regular aluminum.

00:09:25.162 --> 00:09:27.860
That has just
turned into shards.

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.140
We have melted down
some aluminum in our furnace,

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.200
and now we have
some solid gallium pieces,

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.650
and we want to see what happens
if we put the solid gallium

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:36.240
into the liquid aluminum.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.540
I know it will melt them,

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:39.449
but I want to see
if it'll melt them down well,

00:09:39.449 --> 00:09:41.149
if it will turn
into all one alloy,

00:09:41.149 --> 00:09:43.120
and then see if that's
any different after we pour

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.440
that out, and let it cool down.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:48.560
[Music]

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.440
It's got some slag in it,
but it's molten.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:10:07.620
[Music]

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.760
The aluminum is reacting
to the water.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.340
Yep, almost instantly.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:12.920
Yep, that's pretty normal.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.040
But we're using sand,

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.840
so that all of that reacting
boiling water can escape down,

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.840
and it doesn't cause
the aluminum to pop up.

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:23.120
Do you think it's actually going
to stay together in one piece,

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.360
or is it going to be too brittle
and just fall apart?

00:10:25.362 --> 00:10:26.800
I think it'll stay together.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.702
I think it's going to be
really really weak bar here.

00:10:29.817 --> 00:10:30.462
See?
Okay.

00:10:30.462 --> 00:10:31.662
This is what I want.

00:10:31.662 --> 00:10:32.560
I want to know.

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:34.680
Nope.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:35.920
That just fall apart?

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:36.420
It's just--

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:37.280
it fell right apart.

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.700
Let's see if that same thing
happened with the big ones,

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:42.684
but that is very weak so far.

00:10:42.684 --> 00:10:44.862
&gt;&gt; It's just like--
&gt;&gt; Crumbly almost.

00:10:44.862 --> 00:10:45.940
It's like sand.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.520
It's not holding
together at all.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.600
Like it's going to form,

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.650
it's going to
solidify just fine,

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:54.000
but we're going to be able
to just crush this.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:04.700
[Music]

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:10.920
We now have an alloy
with gallium and aluminum here.

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.580
Let's just to see
what happens when I drop it.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.553
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; It's like shock.

00:11:18.553 --> 00:11:19.600
It's fragile.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.450
Wow.

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:21.940
Very fragile.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.820
The world's worst metal
to construct with,

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:28.380
gallium-aluminum alloy.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:32.000
So this is just been soaking
in the water for just a minute,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.680
and like I think it's actually
extracting the gallium

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.240
from the aluminum here.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:41.660
It's just all the water
is reacting with the aluminum,

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:45.200
and then what gets left behind
is little gallium silver beads.

00:11:45.362 --> 00:11:47.528
Our aluminum-gallium bar
that we broke into lots

00:11:47.528 --> 00:11:49.962
of pieces has now been sitting
in the water overnight,

00:11:49.962 --> 00:11:52.722
and I am very surprised
at what happened.

00:11:52.722 --> 00:11:53.780
It is amazing.

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.660
I thought maybe it would
like fall apart a little bit,

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.140
but this is...

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:58.920
Now, you can't really
see into the liquid.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.956
The liquid is just opaque gray,

00:12:00.956 --> 00:12:02.691
but we still
have hydrogen rising.

00:12:02.691 --> 00:12:04.985
So the gallium
itself completely ruined.

00:12:04.985 --> 00:12:06.307
This is fun too because,

00:12:06.307 --> 00:12:08.760
what's coming off the,
all these bubbles forming?

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:13.060
[Music]

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:14.520
Okay, but now...

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:17.600
Check out-- Check out
what happens to the metal rod

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.560
that we made.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:23.520
We now have metallic sponge.

00:12:23.522 --> 00:12:24.322
It like--

00:12:24.322 --> 00:12:26.380
It just absorbed water.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:29.740
It just pulled itself apart,
sucking in the water.

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:30.940
It barely holds itself together.

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:32.200
I can squish it.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:36.840
All of those bar pieces
just turned into this.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.320
I can't even pick one up
without breaking it.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.340
It smooshes.

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:47.240
