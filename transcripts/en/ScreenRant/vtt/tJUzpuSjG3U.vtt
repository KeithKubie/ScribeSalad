00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.490
A cast of interesting characters is essential
in producing a compelling and captivating

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.490
film.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.490
&nbsp;Some actors dedicate themselves, delving
deeply into the persona someone else created.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.360
While the screenwriter and director may have
a hand in bringing a character to the actor,

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.741
it is the actor’s duty to bring the character
to fruition and sometimes that can be unforgettable.

00:00:20.741 --> 00:00:22.560
Whether it be an ensemble film or one with
a showcased lead, every supporting player

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.689
has the potential of shining just a little
bit brighter than everyone else.

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.390
Here are 10 Amazing Movie Characters who Completely
Steal the Show.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.930
Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad
It is hard to believe that there was time

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.760
before Harley Quinn but unlike her maniacal
paramour, the Joker, who first appeared in

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.760
DC comics in 1940, she did not make her first
appearance until 1992 in Batman: The Animated

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.760
Series.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.199
In that time, she has become one of the most
popular characters in the DC universe with

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:51.199
her appearances in video games, comics, and
animated series.

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:52.199
She even popped up on the short-lived live
action series Birds of Prey.

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.809
It was the eagerly anticipated Suicide Squad
that combined all of the Harley Quinn fervor

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.579
into one tremendous portrayal by the stunning
Margot Robbie.

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.920
Harley’s beguiling beauty is made even more
fascinating by her absolutely psychotic dedication

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.440
to The Joker but the Joker takes a backseat
to his girlfriend in Suicide Squad.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.940
There is a reason why each of the film’s
trailers featured Harley Quinn front and center;

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:13.940
she is hypnotizing in her madness.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:14.940
Dragging her baseball bat behind her as she
nearly skips with joy to create even more

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:15.940
chaos, Harley Quinn is a pigtailed nutcase
and completely steals every scene she’s

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.860
in and has a good laugh about it afterward.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.080
Megan in Bridesmaids
Bridesmaids proved itself as not only a hilarious

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.080
female driven comedy but as a supplier of
memorable quotes and disastrous situations.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.040
Kristen Wiig plays a woman competing over
the friendship and maid of honor status of

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.040
her best friend played by Maya Rudolph.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.580
Career changing performances abound in Bridesmaids.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.060
From Rose Byrne cementing her position as
a comedic actress to Rebel Wilson’s uproarious

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.574
introduction to audiences, the film is filled
with fantastic characters.

00:01:36.574 --> 00:01:39.910
However, it is the character of Megan who
truly takes the wedding cake on this one.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.540
After years as a likeable supporting actress,
Melissa McCarthy stepped into the role of

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.920
a feisty Golden Retriever-stealing woman who
also happens to be an incredibly considerate

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.310
friend and possibly the character in the movie
with the biggest heart.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:59.810
Bridesmaids has become a modern comedy classic
and the same can go for the character of Megan.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.400
Hit girl from Kick-Ass
Kick-Ass is a film about a normal teenage

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.790
boy who is such a big fan of comic books and
superheroes that he decides to take a page

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.979
from his favorite heroes and rid the streets
of crime.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:10.979
He develops his own character and gives him
the not-too-cutesy name of Kick-Ass.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.450
After getting beat up far too many times because
he has no actual superpowers, he comes across

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.629
the next character on our list, Hit Girl.

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:18.629
Hit Girl is the pint-sized costumed vigilante
who has real fighting chops thanks to her

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:19.629
father and crime-fighting colleague, Big Daddy.

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:23.010
Chloe Grace Moritz as Hit Girl steals every
scene she’s in and frankly, the film probably

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.010
should have been called Hit Girl, but everyone
loves an underdog, and Hit Girl is far too

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.769
good at everything to be an underdog.

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.239
Along with her mastery of weapons and her
ferocious scrappiness, Hit Girl also carries

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.769
an emotional pull for audiences as she is
still just a little girl playing in the big

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:35.769
bad world.

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.500
Hit Girl is one kick-ass movie character.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.540
Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs
When thinking about The 1992 Academy Award

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.060
winning film, The Silence of the Lambs, most
people immediately think of Hannibal Lecter.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.730
However, if viewers think about it, Lecter
was not the main character and was actually

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.780
only in 25 minutes of the 2 hour film.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.656
While the demented killer Buffalo Bill is
the psycho Agent Clarice Starling is desperately

00:02:58.656 --> 00:02:59.656
searching for, it is through Hannibal Lecter
she believes she will find the answers.

00:02:59.656 --> 00:03:03.079
The character of Hannibal Lecter is terrifying,
brilliant, and has some of the most memorable

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:04.079
lines in film history.

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:05.170
Lecter is such a scene stealing character
that along with multiple films made featuring

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.170
the character, NBC created a show starring
the psychiatrist turned cannibalistic killer.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.159
Lecter is a truly delicious film character.

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:10.790
Steven Buscemi Con Air
It may seem impossible to steal any attention

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:11.860
away from Nicolas Cage, but in Con-Air Steve
Buscemi’s Garland Greene managed to do just

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:12.860
that.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:13.860
In the film, Cage plays a man who was imprisoned
after accidentally killing a man for getting

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:14.860
aggressive with Cage’s pregnant wife.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:15.860
Eight years later, he gets to go home and
meet his child.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:16.860
All is well until the convicts who are transported
on the same plane decide to take it over and

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:17.860
things get a bit crazy.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:18.860
In a film that also includes scene-chewing
efforts by Ving Rhames, Dave Chappelle and

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:19.860
John Malkovich, Buscemi’s Garland is just
fantastic.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:20.860
He has killed more people than the Manson
Family, and Ted Bundy combined but he is still

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:21.860
so darn likable.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:22.860
He’s sick, hilarious and oddly comforting.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.900
In a plane full of criminals he may be one
of the few that seems like a decent guy.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:33.939
He’s, of course, a deranged serial killer,
but there is almost something satisfying that

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:38.469
his final moments of the film see him on a
winning streak in a casino and having the

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:42.719
best time.

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:46.890
Jay and Silent Bob in Clerks
The foul mouthed twosome have appeared in

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.370
more Kevin Smith projects than any other actor.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.370
Smith playing Silent Bob certainly helps with
scheduling.

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.790
It all started in 1993 when Smith was working
on his film with a $27,000 budget, Clerks,

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.430
and asked his buddy Jason Mewes to play drug
dealer, Jay.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.859
It was simple enough, as the character was
based on a teenage Mewes.

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:02.849
Although he was nervous, he pushed through
it and he along with Smith continued to make

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:03.849
appearances in films Mallrats, Chasing Amy,
Dogma, and Clerks 2.

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:07.790
The characters who were supposed to be random
dudes standing on the sidelines managed to

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.599
carve their own place in pop culture history.

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:15.269
Smith was so sure audiences enjoyed the New
Jersey Duo, he and Mewes made the film Jay

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.940
and Silent Bob Strike Back.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.930
Even with their escalating notoriety, it was
their debut in the grainy and simplistic Clerks

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.210
that created characters that stole the show.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.699
The Joker in The Dark Knight
The Joker has always been an interesting scene-stealing

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:35.669
character in every interpretation of the role.

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:36.669
From the illustrated pages of DC comics in
the 1940s to Cesar Romero in the 1960s, Jack

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:37.669
Nicholson in 1989 to the current tattooed,
mouth-full-of-metal, Jared Leto version.

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:42.400
The one that sticks out among all others is
Heath Ledger’s portrayal which annihilated

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.610
any past or future attempts at the grinning
lunatic.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:45.759
The Dark Knight was a filmmaking revolution
and created a precedent for performances in

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:46.759
comic book films.

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:47.759
Ledger’s performance was no joke and his
character sticks out as the most important

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:48.759
element of the film.

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:49.759
His deeply unhinged Joker not only filled
every scene with uncomfortable moments that

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:52.919
washed away any trace of the actor playing
him, but maintained a kinetic quality throughout

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:54.440
each scene in the movie.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.940
Even the scenes he wasn’t in were made more
exciting as audiences did not know when to

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.289
expect his entrance and what may be next.

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:04.730
The Joker certainly put a smile on the faces
of audiences.

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:09.460
Jack Black High Fidelity
In the 2000 John Cusack starring comedy High

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.210
Fidelity, Jack Black steals the show essentially
playing himself.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.590
His character, Barry is a bombastic music
elitist with over-the-top declarations and

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:19.750
memorable rants.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.120
Black’s previous roles in films flew under
the radar, for the most part, only occasionally

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.530
triggering mild interest but the character
of Barry allowed Black to completely unravel

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.430
in the best way possible.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.289
The engaging comedy is adapted from a Nick
Hornby novel and bubbles with charm and humor

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:38.490
but Barry still manages to give the film a
jolt of energy.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.539
The final moments of the film bring the house
down with Barry and his band, Barry Jive and

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:44.820
the Uptown Five.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.240
The Crowd goes wild and so did viewers.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.440
Spiderman, Captain America: Civil War
Spider Man has had plenty of opportunity to

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.530
be front and center.

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:59.129
Tobey Maguire’s Peter Parker exhibited the
awkwardness of adolescence, guilt of losing

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:02.380
Uncle Ben, and the elation of love with Mary
Jane.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.979
Andrew Garfield gave audiences a more cocky
and confident Peter Parker who loved and lost

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:06.979
the sweet and feisty Gwen Stacy.

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:10.160
It would seem that excitement for the web
slinging superhero had been exhausted.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.909
That was until Spider Man flung back into
a film and our hearts with a short appearance

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:16.300
in Captain America Civil War.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.300
An ally of Tony Stark, Spidey takes part in
a battle of superheroes.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.439
Tom Holland plays the young Peter Parker this
time and even in a film filled to the brim

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:26.789
of a who’s who of crime fighters, he manages
to steal the show as easily as he steals Captain

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:28.800
America’s shield.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.110
Quicksilver, X-Men Days of Future Past.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:32.110
Just like the Avengers films, the X-Men series
are each an ensemble piece and provide a feast

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:33.110
for the eyes and plenty of heroes who share
screen time.

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:34.110
With each new X-Men film, a few new mutants
are highlighted so while the films give different

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:35.110
characters a chance to shine it is easy for
them to get lost in the mutant mix.

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:36.720
Quicksilver is more than just Marvel’s answer
to The Flash, he’s his own brand of accelerated

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:42.110
momentum and he displays his fancy footwork,
sense of humor and penchant for kleptomania

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.430
in X-Men Days of Future Past.

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:48.419
Every scene in the film gets a little bit
more exciting with the presence of Quicksilver,

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:52.159
most notably a scene in which audiences are
able to see what life is like from his perspective.

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:54.300
Slowed down and set to Jim Croce’s “Time
in a Bottle”, the speedy Peter Maximoff

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.770
not only stops bullets from hitting his fellow
mutant friends but has a good time messing

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.449
with everyone in the room since he has the
extra time.

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:05.931
It may be one of the best and most memorable
scenes in a superhero movie thanks to the

00:07:05.931 --> 00:07:07.270
scene stealing Quicksilver.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:08.400
There’s our list.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.990
There are plenty more movie characters who
steal the entire movie, which ones did we

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:13.990
forget?
