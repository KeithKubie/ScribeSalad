00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.180
What we're going to do in
this video is think

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.660
about two wave sources.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.890
But one of them is going to be
stationary and the other one

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.000
is going to be moving.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.890
And just to have a concrete
number, it's moving at 5

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.570
meters per second
to the right.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.960
And what we're going to think
about is where are the crests

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.280
of the wave that it's
been releasing for

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.340
the last 3 or 4 seconds?

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.565
So let's say that in both cases,
they are releasing a

00:00:26.565 --> 00:00:30.860
wave. So the velocity of the
wave is going to be 10 meters

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:31.450
per second.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.420
You could visualize this, maybe,
as a sound wave, but

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.120
sound and air move much, much,
much, much faster than 10

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.050
meters per second.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.890
But this'll make the
math work out easy.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.040
Especially relative to this
guy, who is moving to the

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.220
right at 5 meters per second.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.760
And that's the whole point, to
give you the intuition and

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.330
make the math really
simple here.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.400
And both of these guys are going
to be, the wave that

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.040
they're emitting is at
10 meters per second.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.110
And the period of the wave
is going to be at

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.370
1 second per cycle.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.940
And if the period is 1 second
per cycle, you take the

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.430
inverse of that-- the frequency
of the source, I

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.570
guess you could call it, of the
wave, as being emitted is

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:08.710
going to be the inverse
of this.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.100
The inverse of 1 is just 1.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.680
But 1 cycle per second.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.910
If it takes a second for a
cycle, it's also in 1 second,

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.180
you're also going to see 1
cycle, so 1 cycle per second.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.740
So let's think about what's
happening here.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.250
So let's think about where--
let's say it emitted a crest

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.810
of it's a wave exactly
1 second ago.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.570
Where is that crest
going to be now?

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.750
Let's think about the stationary
character.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.630
Well, this guy emitted
a crest 1 second ago.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.850
It's moving outward.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:38.760
So this is outward.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.710
It's movie outward radially.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.660
We need to give a direction if
I'm giving a vector quantity.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.410
So it's moving outward at
10 meters per second.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.260
So if it emitted it 1 second
ago, it's going to be 10

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.480
meters radially outward
from the source.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:56.380
So maybe that is right
over there.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.090
Well, let me draw it a little
bit neater like that.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.880
So that's where that
crest will be.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.730
Now what about this guy?

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.940
Where's the crest that this
guy emitted 1 second ago?

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.960
You might want to just draw a
radius 10 meters around this

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:14.460
guy as well.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.070
But he wasn't here
1 second ago.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.910
He was 5 meters to the left.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.390
Remember, he's moving 5 meters
per second to the right.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.810
1 second ago, he was 5
meters to the left.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.680
So maybe that places him
right over there.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.300
So the crest that he emitted 1
second ago isn't going to be

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.150
10 meters from this guy.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.440
It's going to be 10
meters radially

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.690
outward from that guy.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.090
So this is where he is now.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.250
That's where he was 1 second
ago, where he emitted this

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.600
crest that has now traveled
10 meters away.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.520
This a little inexact,
so I could draw it a

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.510
little bit like that.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.360
This is 5 meters.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.700
That's 10 meters away.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.520
But you get the general idea.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.350
Now let's keep going.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.760
Let's think about the crest
that both of these guys

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.130
emitted 2 seconds ago.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.700
This guy's been stationary
the whole time.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.430
If he emitted it 2 seconds
ago, it's traveling at 10

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.860
meters per second.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.580
It's going to be 20 meters
radially outward from the

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.030
center, from the source.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:30.750
So it will look something
like that.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.810
I'm just drawing the
crest of the waves.

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.335
If you think of water, a pebble
being dropped into the

00:03:35.335 --> 00:03:38.010
pond, these are just the high
points on the wave that

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.240
spreads radially outward from
where the pebble was dropped.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.510
Now this guy, once again, you
can't just draw a circle

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.520
around this because he wasn't
here 2 seconds ago.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.770
He was right here.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.650
He was right here
2 seconds ago.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.870
1 second ago, he was 5
meters to the left.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.990
A second before that, he was
5 meters more to the left.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.060
So that wave that he emitted
then is going to be 20 meters

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.965
radially outward from
this point.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.595
So the center isn't going
to be that or that.

00:04:10.595 --> 00:04:14.055
It's going to be that point
where he was 2 seconds ago.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.630
So what about the crest that
either of these of sources

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.020
emitted 3 seconds ago?

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.590
Well, it would be 30 meters
radially outward, so another

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.000
10 meters from the last one.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.110
So it will be out here.

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.920
It will be out there
just like that.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.840
This guy has been stationary
the whole time.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.250
But what about this guy?

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.310
He wasn't here 3 seconds ago.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.980
He was here.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:50.160
Right?

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.050
1 second ago, here.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.060
2 seconds ago, there.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.350
3 seconds ago, there.

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.000
So we're going to be
30 meters radially

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.320
outward from this point.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.170
So once again, I can just copy
and paste this right here.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.355
And it should be centered
around that point.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.470
Now, let's think a little bit
about what the perceived

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.750
frequency of this wave would be
for a couple of observers.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.880
So we could put an observer
here, really

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.930
anywhere around this guy.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.770
We could put an observer
right here.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.560
And then we could put another
observer right here.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.550
Now, what's this guy
going to perceive?

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.670
Well, every second he's getting
a pulse-- well,

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:33.700
there's a couple of things
to think about.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.240
First of all, what is the
wavelength of, at least this

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.580
wave right here.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.520
Well, every second, he's
emitting a pulse.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.460
So, a second ago, the pulses
out there would

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.430
have traveled 10 meters.

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.060
And then he emits
another pulse.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.400
So the pulses are going to be 1
second apart, but since they

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.720
traveled 10 meters in that 1
second, they are also going to

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.340
be 10 meters apart.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.740
So the wavelength,
in this case, is

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.000
going to be 10 meters.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.340
The distance between these
crests are 10 meters.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.600
Now what about this situation
right here?

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.640
It depends on what side, whether
the source is coming

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.080
towards you or whether it's
going away from you.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.990
That's the situation
with this guy.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.450
When it's moving towards you,
it's emitting a pulse-- so

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:18.550
let's say it emitted a pulse
right here-- and then, it

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.750
moves 5 meters to
the right before

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.290
emitting the next pulse.

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:25.920
So instead of them being 10
meters apart, in this case,

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.980
this guy has closed
the distance by

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.550
5 meters over here.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.220
So these pulses are only going
to be 5 meters apart.

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.700
So over here, the wavelength
is only 5 meters.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:37.730
You can see it visually.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.340
This distance right here is
half of this distance.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.530
These are 5 meters apart.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.500
And on the left-hand side, if
you're on the side of the

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.480
source that the source is moving
away from, it would be

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.970
10 meters, but every second the
source is also moving 5

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:54.760
more meters away from you.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.940
So this perceived wavelength
right here is

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.890
going to be 15 meters.

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:02.870
And we can see it visually.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.980
That's the whole reason why
I drew it this way.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.360
Now what's going to
be the perceived

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.360
frequencies for this?

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.530
Well, this guy has one crest
passing him right now.

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:15.270
It's going to take exactly 1
second for the next crest to

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:16.350
get to him because
it's traveling at

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:17.580
10 meters per second.

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:24.890
So he is going to perceive 1
crest, or 1 cycle per second,

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:28.080
or a frequency of 1 hertz,
which makes sense.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:28.860
This is stationary.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.880
They're both stationary relative
to each other.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.590
And we're also talking about
classical physics.

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:34.390
We're not getting to relativity
and all that.

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:37.940
But the observed frequency is
the exact frequency that was

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.840
emitted by this guy
right there.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.770
Now what about this situation?

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:47.660
Each of these crests are 5
meters apart for this guy.

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.230
If you imagined that this was
some type of a train coming

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:53.950
towards this guy, each of these
crests are only 5 meters

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:57.450
apart, but they're traveling
at 10 meters per second.

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:01.020
So how many crests are you
going to see in a second?

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.120
Well, you're going to
see two of them.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.956
This one's going to take 1/2 a
second to return you, and then

00:08:03.956 --> 00:08:06.230
in the next 1/2 a second, this
one's going to get to you.

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:08.300
Or you could say this one takes
1/2 second to reach you,

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.300
and this is going to take
1 second to reach you.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.150
So you're going to see two.

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:13.230
So there's two ways
to think of it.

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:17.850
You could say your period in
this situation is 1/2 of a

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:20.500
second per cycle.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.513
Or you could invert it and you
could say that the frequency--

00:08:22.513 --> 00:08:26.140
I mean we could put the observed
frequency-- is going

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:30.810
to be 2 cycles per second.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:32.840
And already notice, this guy's
experiencing a higher

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.760
frequency then this guy over
here, because these wave

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.520
fronts or these crests are
just passing by him more

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.000
frequently.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.020
Because this guy is moving in
the same direction as this

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:44.770
guy, they are closer together.

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:47.470
Now this guy's going to
experience the opposite thing.

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:50.450
Let's say that this crest
is just passing him by.

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:51.890
How long will it take for
the next crest to

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:53.800
cover that 15 meters?

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.520
Well, they're going at
10 meters per second.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:03.730
It's going to be 1.5 seconds per
crest. That's going to be

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:05.540
the observed period
for this guy.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:09.230
You have to take the inverse of
that-- that's 1.5 is 3/2,

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:14.890
that's 2/3 of a --or you could
say crest or 2/3 of a cycle

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:17.150
per second.

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:21.300
So when the source is moving
away from this observer, the

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.270
frequency, or the perceived
frequency, is the lower than

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:28.520
the frequency of the actual
emitted wave. When the source

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.570
is moving towards the
observer, the

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:31.840
frequency is higher.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.810
This might seem some like some
type of bizarre thing but

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:35.770
you've experienced it before.

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:38.230
It's called the Doppler
effect, which you've

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:39.360
probably heard of.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:44.420
And that's exactly what you
experience when you sit at,

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:45.760
maybe, a train crossing.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.410
Be careful not to
sit too close.

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:51.990
And as a train is approaching
you, you noticed-- say it has

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:54.320
its horn going on.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.990
It'd be very high-pitched.

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:58.250
And then right when it passes
you, and it starts moving away

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:00.660
from you, it has a
much lower pitch.

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.680
And that perceived pitch, that's
your brain and your

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.660
ears' way of sensing
frequency.

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:08.800
So when the train is coming
toward you, it's a high pitch,

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:09.930
high frequency.

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:13.080
When it's going away from you,
low pitch, low frequency.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.310
And hopefully, drawing it out
this way gives you a visual

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:20.710
understanding of why that is;
why these points on the cycle,

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:23.290
or these crests, are closer
together when it's moving in

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:25.660
your direction then when they're
farther apart-- when

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.020
it's moving away from you.

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:28.750
In the next video, we'll do
these with more abstract

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:30.670
numbers so we can actually
figure out generalized

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:34.040
formulas for relating the
observed frequency with the

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.680
emitted frequency.
