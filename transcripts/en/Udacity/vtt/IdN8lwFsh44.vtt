[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:12.803
Almost done, almost done.

00:00:12.803 --> 00:00:18.005
That's it,
that's the whole thing and send.

00:00:18.005 --> 00:00:20.965
[SOUND] Whoa, pizza.

00:00:20.965 --> 00:00:26.665
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:26.665 --> 00:00:29.680
&gt;&gt; Large pepperoni and
crazy sticks for Marty McCapp.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.750
&gt;&gt; Micky P.I., that's me.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.729
&gt;&gt; Cool, here you go.

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:33.530
&gt;&gt; Thank goodness you're here.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.110
I'm so hungry, I've been writing
this algorithm for hours.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.198
I solved the flux photon algorithm.

00:00:38.198 --> 00:00:40.258
&gt;&gt; Yeah, cool.

00:00:40.258 --> 00:00:41.900
Okay.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.355
&gt;&gt; You know this algorithm's
going to change the world, right?

00:00:43.355 --> 00:00:46.205
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah.

00:00:46.205 --> 00:00:51.685
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:53.317
&gt;&gt; And, send.

00:00:53.317 --> 00:00:56.280
No, no, no, no, no,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.450
You can't die, you can't die.

00:00:59.174 --> 00:01:02.983
Just turn back on, come on.

00:01:02.983 --> 00:01:05.583
Open up messages.

00:01:05.583 --> 00:01:07.243
Where is it?

00:01:07.243 --> 00:01:11.787
Where's the algorithm?

00:01:11.787 --> 00:01:14.627
No, what am I going to do?

00:01:14.627 --> 00:01:16.717
Doc, Doc will know.

00:01:16.717 --> 00:01:26.005
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:26.005 --> 00:01:26.806
&gt;&gt; Hello?

00:01:26.806 --> 00:01:31.497
[SOUND] Hello, who's this?

00:01:31.497 --> 00:01:33.145
&gt;&gt; Doc, it's me, Marty.

00:01:33.145 --> 00:01:35.246
I solved the flux photon algorithm.

00:01:35.246 --> 00:01:36.744
I had it written down.

00:01:36.744 --> 00:01:40.034
I was going to send it to you and

00:01:40.034 --> 00:01:45.625
then my phone died and
I don't know what to do.

00:01:45.625 --> 00:01:49.423
&gt;&gt; We have to go back Marty,
back to the past and then both in.

00:01:49.423 --> 00:01:50.177
We're sisters.

00:01:50.177 --> 00:01:55.559
