00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Welcome back. We're back in the United States in California,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and behind me is the Stanford dish.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Now, the dish is a radio telescope, and it uses its parabolic reflector

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
to focus radio waves into its antenna.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Now, radio waves are just another form of light.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Light does not travel instantaneously from the stars to our eyes.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It takes time for light to make that journey.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
What this means is that when we look deep into space,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
we're actually looking back in time.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
In this unit, we'll learn a little bit about special relativity

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and some of the fascinating but completely unintuitive physics that happen

00:00:36.000 --> 99:59:59.000
when we move at speed near the speed of light.
