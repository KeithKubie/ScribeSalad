00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.301
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK, now we're
at the Museum of Developer Art,

00:00:42.301 --> 00:00:43.800
and I'm standing
here with Alex, who

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.344
actually curated the pieces
we're about to take a look at.

00:00:46.344 --> 00:00:47.760
Alex, can you tell
me a little bit

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.400
about why you chose these
pieces for a developer festival?

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.280
ALEX: So the two
artists who are here,

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.470
Ezra Miller and Vincent Jose
are both developers themselves

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:58.670
and artists.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.900
And so their work is
really about using code

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.820
to create beautiful,
natural simulations.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.960
Vincent creates
fluid dynamics that

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.360
are interactive, which is
a very hard thing to do.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.060
And Ezra creates data viz--

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.340
sorry, data visualizations, that
are essentially transforming

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.580
into flocking starlings.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.140
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And why these
pieces at this festival?

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.050
ALEX: So I wanted
to find artists

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.100
that could understand
the developer mentality,

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.020
and communicate to
developers, and show

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.730
that by using developer
tools, you can still

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.640
create really beautiful work.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.480
So that's really
the main reason.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.480
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.070
Well, we were looking
at them earlier,

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.320
and that really comes through.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.094
Thank you so much.

00:01:44.094 --> 00:01:44.760
ALEX: Thank you.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.830
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:54.225 --> 00:01:55.600
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
I'm standing here

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.930
with [? Vincent ?]
in front of his art.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.690
Now, I have a few questions.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.410
It's amazing, and I
really need to know more.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.720
But first, can you tell me just
a little bit about this piece,

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.009
your process making
it, what you used,

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.087
and what it represents to you?

00:02:12.087 --> 00:02:15.770
SPEAKER 1: So this piece is
called "Fluid Structure."

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.580
It's an exploration of how
liquid-like shapes form,

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.900
deform, and react under
various forces and stimuli.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.290
So I've been fascinated for a
long time by fluid dynamics,

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.430
because you see it
everywhere in nature,

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.800
like streams, rivers,
smoke, and volcanoes,

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.510
and it's all this incredible
variety of motion,

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.190
very intricate.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:49.140
And historically, it's been
very computationally expensive.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.760
But now, recent
progress makes it

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.690
possible to do the
simulation real-time,

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.180
and that makes it
very exciting for me

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.590
to build interactive pieces
using this technology.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.070
Also, to explore all
kinds of different--

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.340
how it's going to react
playing with different forces,

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.110
and what happens if we
slow the time down, or make

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.920
it really fast.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.560
And I think it seems
familiar and both mysterious,

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.790
because we're used to how
things react to physics laws.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.700
So I think one of the challenges
for this piece was the scale

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.070
and making it interactive
for a large number of people.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.720
So it's using five
different Kinects,

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.810
which is a depth sensor that
can tell the main space where

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.370
the people are.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.960
And it's computing forces
based on where people stand

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.710
to push the liquid around.

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.540
So that most people
who are not always

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.030
familiar with sensors and
interactive installation

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.550
would get it, there's
little hints--

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:55.910
you see your silhouette.

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.900
And some modes where
the water falls on you

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.780
is here to get your
interaction and how

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.230
you influence the
result. And, I think,

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.660
watching the people tonight,
it was a premier for me

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:12.730
as well, too.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.759
I tested it with a few
friends, but it's like,

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:17.300
what are people going to do,
and how are they going to react?

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.720
And a lot of people are
already getting into it,

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.530
and that's pretty
amazing to see that.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.700
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK, so one
more thing is, the size of this

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:26.735
is massive.

00:04:26.735 --> 00:04:28.860
And I don't know what your
studio space looks like,

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.640
but I presume you did
some prototyping that

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.890
wasn't this big before.

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:38.440
How did you conceptualize
a piece this large?

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.940
SPEAKER 1: So I was lucky
I could prototype a smaller

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:49.052
slice, and then I used
VR and Oculus to--

00:04:49.052 --> 00:04:50.010
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Really?

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.560
SPEAKER 1: --get a feel for
the scale of the piece, which

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.940
I had done in the past for
other art installations

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.940
which were also
pretty big-scale.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.650
And I'm based in New
York, so large spaces

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.950
are a rare thing to get.

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.630
So VR for me is really useful
to get a sense of scale.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.680
And the other thing is
that since everything

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.670
is running real-time, I
have a number of parameters

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:18.320
I can adjust quickly once I see
the piece for the first time

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.480
on site at scale,
which I did tonight.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.750
So I slowed down some
things and tweaked

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.940
some timings make it better.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.010
So that's the two ways
I worked on this scale.

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.010
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.219
Well, thank you so much for
sharing your art with us.

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:34.551
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, you're welcome.

00:05:34.551 --> 00:05:35.150
Thanks.

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.640
It's great to be here and
have this opportunity.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:44.287
And thanks to Alex for curating
this medium of developer art.

00:05:44.287 --> 00:05:45.370
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thank you.

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.520
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.620
OK, now we're looking
at the second piece,

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.400
and this one is by Ezra.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.235
Ezra, could you tell us
a little bit about this?

00:05:56.235 --> 00:05:58.380
EZRA: Yeah, so what
we have here is

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:03.470
my piece "Data Murmuration,"
which I built using WebGL,

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.480
so it's just running
in the browser.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.370
And it's a flocking
simulation as well as

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.320
a data visualization.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.590
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So one of
the things that I notice

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.020
about the piece
is you definitely

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.740
have something to say about
the really clear data that

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.615
shows up every once in
a while on this graph,

00:06:20.615 --> 00:06:23.330
but then it breaks out
all these data points

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.780
into this flocking behavior.

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.250
What brought you to
that artistic choice?

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.300
EZRA: So it oscillates
between this sort

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:36.280
of formless cloud of birds
swarming and then this really

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.980
well-defined graph.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.480
I think to me,
it's trying to get

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:47.820
at questions about whether
humanity can organize itself

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:53.000
as we face a lot of
problems as a society.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.810
And I think the difference
between this formless, swirling

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:03.129
cloud and that get at that idea.

00:07:03.129 --> 00:07:04.420
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right, man.

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.664
Hey, let's talk a little
bit more about the tech,

00:07:06.664 --> 00:07:08.330
since we're at the
developer conference.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.645
You said this is in the browser?

00:07:10.645 --> 00:07:14.060
EZRA: Yeah, so I make
websites using WebGL.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:19.830
This was built with three.js,
which is the go-to WebGL

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:23.970
library, and I use it in
all of my work, pretty much.

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:27.440
And it's built
using shaders, which

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.270
are programs that run
on a computer's GPU that

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:36.270
let you do computations a
lot faster than on the CPU.

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:42.610
And it's basically creating
everything procedurally, which

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:48.530
means there's no real
image textures being used

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:51.580
or any other real assets.

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.970
I think the main
asset is the data,

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:57.882
and then everything
comes from that.

00:07:57.882 --> 00:07:59.840
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And I
also noticed, in addition

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.560
to the flocking, there's
this almost waterfall effect.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.915
What is that?

00:08:03.915 --> 00:08:09.530
EZRA: Right, I actually
added that in recently

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:12.039
before we set up.

00:08:12.039 --> 00:08:13.830
I think it just adds
a little more dynamism

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:17.680
to the background, cuts
through the clouds.

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:24.007
It's a feedback
loop process, which

00:08:24.007 --> 00:08:26.090
is something I use in all
of my work, pretty much.

00:08:29.894 --> 00:08:30.810
Yeah, I just thought--

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:32.768
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Let's
leave it at that mystery.

00:08:32.768 --> 00:08:33.674
I like that.

00:08:33.674 --> 00:08:34.340
All right, Ezra.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.560

your work with us today.

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:37.049

I really appreciate it.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:35.683 --> 00:09:36.874
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Wow.

00:09:36.874 --> 00:09:39.680
All right, so I'm here
at the VR drive-in,

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.190
and I'm standing
with [? Sarah, ?]

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:44.874
who actually helped build the
experiences that attendees

00:09:44.874 --> 00:09:46.040
are going through right now.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.590
Can you tell me a
little bit about what

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:48.465
they're experiencing?

00:09:48.465 --> 00:09:50.670
SPEAKER 2: Yeah, so we're
Google Spotlight Stories,

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:53.620
and we are creating
content that directors

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.470
create their own
stories in this medium.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.960
So we have "Pearl"
by Patrick Osborne,

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.730
which was nominated
for an Academy Award

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:01.850
this year for Best
Animated short film.

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:04.380
And we have the Gorillaz'
newest music video,

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.310
which is the first music
video for our group.

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:08.940
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Now, you worked
with the production teams

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.663
and the artists in building
these experiences, right?

00:10:11.663 --> 00:10:12.630
SPEAKER 2: Yes, yes.

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:14.005
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
What's that like?

00:10:14.005 --> 00:10:15.620
Do they have all
sorts of questions?

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:18.657
What's different from a
normal production experience?

00:10:18.657 --> 00:10:21.240
SPEAKER 2: Yeah, it's definitely
a new medium for most people,

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.555
but both took to it very well.

00:10:24.555 --> 00:10:26.180
You have to think
about creating a film

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:27.830
in 360 space a little
bit differently

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:29.970
than you would a
normal 2D narrative

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:33.110
film, so you have to make it
interesting in all directions,

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:34.197
if you will.

00:10:34.197 --> 00:10:35.280

00:12:02.406 --> 00:12:04.751
[LAUGHING]

00:12:07.049 --> 00:12:09.090
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Coming to
you live from the world

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:14.523
championships of pair ping
pong, here at Google I/O.

00:12:14.523 --> 00:12:15.981
I'm just kidding,
we're having fun.

00:12:15.981 --> 00:12:19.418
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:24.977 --> 00:12:27.060
All right, there's probably
something I could say,

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:28.700
but honestly, this
is just mini golf.

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:30.285
So I'm going to
go have some fun.

00:12:30.285 --> 00:12:33.750
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:00.446 --> 00:13:03.224
What am I doing here?

00:13:03.224 --> 00:13:05.390
SPEAKER 4: All right, so
it's a 360 video booth that

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:07.170
records high-frame slow motion.

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:10.099
So anything that
you do looks cool.

00:13:10.099 --> 00:13:11.390
You get to share it right away.

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:12.560
Does that sound good?

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.525
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah.

00:13:13.525 --> 00:13:15.090
SPEAKER 4: So the
main rule is, you

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:16.673
don't leave the
platform until I catch

00:13:16.673 --> 00:13:18.479
the arm so you don't get hurt.

00:13:18.479 --> 00:13:20.603
Other than that, you can
do anything that you want.

00:13:20.603 --> 00:13:21.525
you can jump, move.

00:13:21.525 --> 00:13:23.620
Moving quick is cool,
standing perfectly still

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:25.211
is cool, either way.

00:13:25.211 --> 00:13:26.710
TIMOTHY JORDAN: But
don't move slow.

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:29.001
SPEAKER 4: Yeah, because
it'll be kind of melodramatic.

00:13:29.001 --> 00:13:31.035
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So like
a jump or something?

00:13:31.035 --> 00:13:32.425
SPEAKER 4: Yeah, that'd be good.

00:13:32.425 --> 00:13:33.050
You good to go?

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:33.925
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah.

00:13:36.394 --> 00:13:38.134
All right, I'm just
testing it out.

00:13:38.134 --> 00:13:39.425
SPEAKER 4: I'll count you down.

00:13:39.425 --> 00:13:40.124
3, 2, 1, go.

00:13:40.124 --> 00:13:42.290
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I don't
really know what's going on,

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:43.539
but I'm going to go with this.

00:13:43.539 --> 00:13:46.889
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.020
I am tuckered out.

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:47.700
[LAUGHING] Thanks for
joining me at the block party

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:50.450
here on the first
evening of Google I/O.

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:52.530
We saw a lot of
really cool stuff,

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:55.310
and I hope you had
as much fun as I did.
