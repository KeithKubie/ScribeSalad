what I want to do in this video is talk

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320
what I want to do in this video is talk
 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.090
what I want to do in this video is talk
a little bit about compounding

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:13.100
a little bit about compounding
 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.099
a little bit about compounding
compounding interest and then have a

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109
compounding interest and then have a
 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.109
compounding interest and then have a
little bit of a discussion of a way to

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119
little bit of a discussion of a way to
 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.870
little bit of a discussion of a way to
quickly a kind of an approximate way to

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880
quickly a kind of an approximate way to
 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.400
quickly a kind of an approximate way to
figure out how quickly something

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410
figure out how quickly something
 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.380
figure out how quickly something
compounds and then we'll actually see

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390
compounds and then we'll actually see
 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.899
compounds and then we'll actually see
how good of an approximation this really

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:26.909
how good of an approximation this really
 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:28.939
how good of an approximation this really
is so just as a review let's say I'm

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949
is so just as a review let's say I'm
 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.710
is so just as a review let's say I'm
running some type of a bank and I tell

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720
running some type of a bank and I tell
 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.439
running some type of a bank and I tell
you that I am offering 10 percent

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:33.449
you that I am offering 10 percent
 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:36.670
you that I am offering 10 percent
interest that compounds annually

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680
interest that compounds annually
 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.990
interest that compounds annually
compounds compounds annually that's

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000
compounds compounds annually that's
 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.939
compounds compounds annually that's
usually not the case in a real bank you

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949
usually not the case in a real bank you
 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:46.160
usually not the case in a real bank you
would probably compound continuously but

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170
would probably compound continuously but
 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.419
would probably compound continuously but
I'm just going to keep it a simple

00:00:47.419 --> 00:00:47.429
I'm just going to keep it a simple
 

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:49.430
I'm just going to keep it a simple
example compounding annually there are

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440
example compounding annually there are
 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.049
example compounding annually there are
other videos on compounding continuously

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059
other videos on compounding continuously
 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.150
other videos on compounding continuously
this makes the math a little simpler and

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160
this makes the math a little simpler and
 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.689
this makes the math a little simpler and
all that means is that let's say today

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699
all that means is that let's say today
 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:00.709
all that means is that let's say today
today you deposit $100 in that bank

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719
today you deposit $100 in that bank
 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.160
today you deposit $100 in that bank
account if we wait one year and you just

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170
account if we wait one year and you just
 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.050
account if we wait one year and you just
keep that in the bank account then

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060
keep that in the bank account then
 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.819
keep that in the bank account then
you'll have your hundred dollars you'll

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:07.829
you'll have your hundred dollars you'll
 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:11.300
you'll have your hundred dollars you'll
have your hundred dollars plus 10% on

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310
have your hundred dollars plus 10% on
 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.300
have your hundred dollars plus 10% on
your hundred dollar deposit 10% of a

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310
your hundred dollar deposit 10% of a
 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.399
your hundred dollar deposit 10% of a
hundred is going to be another ten

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409
hundred is going to be another ten
 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.649
hundred is going to be another ten
dollars so after a year you're going to

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659
dollars so after a year you're going to
 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.920
dollars so after a year you're going to
have one hundred and ten dollars one

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930
have one hundred and ten dollars one
 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.719
have one hundred and ten dollars one
hundred and ten dollars you can just say

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729
hundred and ten dollars you can just say
 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.490
hundred and ten dollars you can just say
I added ten percent to the hundred and

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500
I added ten percent to the hundred and
 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.179
I added ten percent to the hundred and
then after two years or a year after

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189
then after two years or a year after
 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.999
then after two years or a year after
that first year after two years you're

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009
that first year after two years you're
 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.700
that first year after two years you're
going to get ten percent not just on the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710
going to get ten percent not just on the
 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.620
going to get ten percent not just on the
hundred dollars you're going to get ten

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630
hundred dollars you're going to get ten
 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.450
hundred dollars you're going to get ten
percent on the hundred and ten dollars

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460
percent on the hundred and ten dollars
 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.300
percent on the hundred and ten dollars
so your 10% on 110 is you're going to

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310
so your 10% on 110 is you're going to
 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.550
so your 10% on 110 is you're going to
get another eleven dollars so 10 percent

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560
get another eleven dollars so 10 percent
 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.469
get another eleven dollars so 10 percent
110 is $11 so you're gonna get 110 that

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479
110 is $11 so you're gonna get 110 that
 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.179
110 is $11 so you're gonna get 110 that
was you can imagine your deposit

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189
was you can imagine your deposit
 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.370
was you can imagine your deposit
entering your second year and then you

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380
entering your second year and then you
 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.410
entering your second year and then you
get plus ten percent on that not ten

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420
get plus ten percent on that not ten
 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.090
get plus ten percent on that not ten
percent on your initial deposit that's

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100
percent on your initial deposit that's
 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.120
percent on your initial deposit that's
why we say it compounds you get interest

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130
why we say it compounds you get interest
 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.149
why we say it compounds you get interest
on the interest from previous years so

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159
on the interest from previous years so
 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.840
on the interest from previous years so
110 plus now eleven dollars so every

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850
110 plus now eleven dollars so every
 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.010
110 plus now eleven dollars so every
year the amount of interest we're

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020
year the amount of interest we're
 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.120
year the amount of interest we're
getting if we don't read draw anything

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130
getting if we don't read draw anything
 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.669
getting if we don't read draw anything
goes up so now we have a hundred and one

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679
goes up so now we have a hundred and one
 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.160
goes up so now we have a hundred and one
hundred and twenty one dollars and I

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170
hundred and twenty one dollars and I
 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.150
hundred and twenty one dollars and I
could just keep

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160
could just keep
 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.400
could just keep
that and the general way to figure out

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410
that and the general way to figure out
 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.950
that and the general way to figure out
how much you have after let's say n

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960
how much you have after let's say n
 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.740
how much you have after let's say n
years is you multiply it so let's say

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750
years is you multiply it so let's say
 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.380
years is you multiply it so let's say
some let's say my original I'll use a

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390
some let's say my original I'll use a
 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.360
some let's say my original I'll use a
little bit of algebra here so let's say

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370
little bit of algebra here so let's say
 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.570
little bit of algebra here so let's say
this is my original deposit or my

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580
this is my original deposit or my
 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.330
this is my original deposit or my
principal however you want to view it

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340
principal however you want to view it
 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.520
principal however you want to view it
after X years so after one year you

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530
after X years so after one year you
 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.380
after X years so after one year you
would just multiply it to get to get to

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390
would just multiply it to get to get to
 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.030
would just multiply it to get to get to
this number right here you multiply it

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040
this number right here you multiply it
 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.790
this number right here you multiply it
by one point one one actually let me do

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800
by one point one one actually let me do
 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.720
by one point one one actually let me do
it this way I don't want to be too

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730
it this way I don't want to be too
 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.080
it this way I don't want to be too
abstract so just to get the math here so

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090
abstract so just to get the math here so
 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.600
abstract so just to get the math here so
to get to this number right here we just

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610
to get to this number right here we just
 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.460
to get to this number right here we just
multiplied that number right there is a

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470
multiplied that number right there is a
 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.570
multiplied that number right there is a
hundred times one plus ten percent or

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580
hundred times one plus ten percent or
 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.110
hundred times one plus ten percent or
you could say one point one now this

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120
you could say one point one now this
 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.760
you could say one point one now this
number right here is going to be this

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770
number right here is going to be this
 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.680
number right here is going to be this
one hundred ten times one point one

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690
one hundred ten times one point one
 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.320
one hundred ten times one point one
again so it's this it's the hundred

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330
again so it's this it's the hundred
 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.740
again so it's this it's the hundred
times one point one which was this

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750
times one point one which was this
 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.810
times one point one which was this
number right there and now we're going

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820
number right there and now we're going
 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.880
number right there and now we're going
to multiply that times one point one

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890
to multiply that times one point one
 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.230
to multiply that times one point one
again and remember where does the one

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240
again and remember where does the one
 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.250
again and remember where does the one
point one come from 1.1 1.1 is the same

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260
point one come from 1.1 1.1 is the same
 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.760
point one come from 1.1 1.1 is the same
thing as one hundred percent plus

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770
thing as one hundred percent plus
 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.370
thing as one hundred percent plus
another 10 percent right that's what

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380
another 10 percent right that's what
 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.690
another 10 percent right that's what
we're getting we have a hundred percent

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700
we're getting we have a hundred percent
 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.960
we're getting we have a hundred percent
of our original deposit plus another 10

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970
of our original deposit plus another 10
 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.120
of our original deposit plus another 10
percent so we're multiplying by one

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130
percent so we're multiplying by one
 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.280
percent so we're multiplying by one
point one here we're doing that twice we

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290
point one here we're doing that twice we
 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.190
point one here we're doing that twice we
multiply by one point one twice so after

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200
multiply by one point one twice so after
 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.020
multiply by one point one twice so after
three years how much money do we have

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030
three years how much money do we have
 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.220
three years how much money do we have
it's going to be so after three years

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230
it's going to be so after three years
 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.490
it's going to be so after three years
we're going to have 100 times one point

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500
we're going to have 100 times one point
 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.190
we're going to have 100 times one point
one to the one point one to the third

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200
one to the one point one to the third
 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.580
one to the one point one to the third
power after n years now we're getting a

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590
power after n years now we're getting a
 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.440
power after n years now we're getting a
little abstract here we're going to have

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450
little abstract here we're going to have
 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.770
little abstract here we're going to have
a 100 times one point one to the nth

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780
a 100 times one point one to the nth
 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.540
a 100 times one point one to the nth
power and now you could imagine this is

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550
power and now you could imagine this is
 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.420
power and now you could imagine this is
not easy to calculate and if we this was

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430
not easy to calculate and if we this was
 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.520
not easy to calculate and if we this was
a this was all the situation where we're

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530
a this was all the situation where we're
 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.860
a this was all the situation where we're
dealing with 10% if we were dealing in a

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870
dealing with 10% if we were dealing in a
 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.440
dealing with 10% if we were dealing in a
world would say let's say it's 7% so

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450
world would say let's say it's 7% so
 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.460
world would say let's say it's 7% so
let's say this is a different reality

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470
let's say this is a different reality
 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.390
let's say this is a different reality
here where we have 7% compounding annual

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400
here where we have 7% compounding annual
 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.310
here where we have 7% compounding annual
interest then after one year one year we

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320
interest then after one year one year we
 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.039
interest then after one year one year we
would have 100 times instead of one

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049
would have 100 times instead of one
 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.750
would have 100 times instead of one
point one it'd be a hundred percent plus

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760
point one it'd be a hundred percent plus
 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.510
point one it'd be a hundred percent plus
7% or 1.07 after let's skip let's go

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520
7% or 1.07 after let's skip let's go
 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.520
7% or 1.07 after let's skip let's go
two three years after three years I

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530
two three years after three years I
 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.230
two three years after three years I
could do two in between it'd be 100

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240
could do two in between it'd be 100
 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:36.170
could do two in between it'd be 100
times 1.07 to the third power 1.0 seven

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180
times 1.07 to the third power 1.0 seven
 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.670
times 1.07 to the third power 1.0 seven
times itself three times after n years

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680
times itself three times after n years
 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.520
times itself three times after n years
would be 1.07 to the nth power so I

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530
would be 1.07 to the nth power so I
 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.839
would be 1.07 to the nth power so I
think you get the sense here that

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:41.849
think you get the sense here that
 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:43.939
think you get the sense here that
although the idea is reasonably simple

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949
although the idea is reasonably simple
 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.040
although the idea is reasonably simple
to actually calculate compounding

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050
to actually calculate compounding
 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.240
to actually calculate compounding
interest is actually pretty difficult

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250
interest is actually pretty difficult
 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.999
interest is actually pretty difficult
and even more let's say I were to ask

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:50.009
and even more let's say I were to ask
 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:56.749
and even more let's say I were to ask
you how long does it take how long does

00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:56.759
you how long does it take how long does
 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:05.360
you how long does it take how long does
it take to double your money so if you

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370
it take to double your money so if you
 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.999
it take to double your money so if you
were to just use this math right here

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:08.009
were to just use this math right here
 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:09.260
were to just use this math right here
you'd have to say gee I would have to

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270
you'd have to say gee I would have to
 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.629

double my money I would have to start
with $100 and I'm going to multiply that

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460

to the X is equal to well I'm gonna

00:05:24.619 --> 00:05:24.629
to the X is equal to well I'm gonna
 

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:25.909
to the X is equal to well I'm gonna
double my money so it's gonna have to

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919
double my money so it's gonna have to
 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.700
double my money so it's gonna have to
equal to $200 and I'm now I'm going to

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710
equal to $200 and I'm now I'm going to
 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.529
equal to $200 and I'm now I'm going to
have to solve for X and I'm gonna have

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539
have to solve for X and I'm gonna have
 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:32.420
have to solve for X and I'm gonna have
to do some logarithms here you can

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430
to do some logarithms here you can
 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.490
to do some logarithms here you can
divide both sides by 100 you get 1 point

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500
divide both sides by 100 you get 1 point
 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.059
divide both sides by 100 you get 1 point
1 to the X is equal to 2 I just divided

00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:38.069
1 to the X is equal to 2 I just divided
 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:40.580
1 to the X is equal to 2 I just divided
both sides by a hundred and then you

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590
both sides by a hundred and then you
 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.839
both sides by a hundred and then you
could take the logarithm of both sides

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:41.849
could take the logarithm of both sides
 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:45.920
could take the logarithm of both sides
base 1.1 and you get X and I'm showing

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930
base 1.1 and you get X and I'm showing
 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.689
base 1.1 and you get X and I'm showing
you that this is complicated on purpose

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:47.699
you that this is complicated on purpose
 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:49.399
you that this is complicated on purpose
and any of this is confusing there's

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:49.409
and any of this is confusing there's
 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:51.469
and any of this is confusing there's
multiple videos on how to solve these

multiple videos on how to solve these
 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:55.580
multiple videos on how to solve these
you get X is equal to log base 1.1 of 2

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590
you get X is equal to log base 1.1 of 2
 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.890
you get X is equal to log base 1.1 of 2
and most of us cannot do this in our
