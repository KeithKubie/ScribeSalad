00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:32.358
OOH, THAT'S HOT, PRINCE.

00:01:32.391 --> 00:01:33.693

AND WE'RE LISTENING
TO THE MUSIC AND EVERYTHING.

00:01:51.677 --> 00:01:52.812
GROOVING AT THE CRIB.

00:01:52.845 --> 00:01:54.413
HE HAD GIRLS OVER THERE.

00:01:54.446 --> 00:01:56.649
HE HAD A NICE ENVIRONMENT.
IT WAS TIGHT.

00:01:58.784 --> 00:02:01.554
THIS BORES ME.

00:02:01.587 --> 00:02:03.890
IS ANYONE UP
FOR A GAME OF BASKETBALL?

00:02:05.524 --> 00:02:08.461
[laughs]

00:02:10.062 --> 00:02:12.565
HOW ABOUT
YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS

00:02:12.598 --> 00:02:16.102
VERSUS ME
AND THE REVOLUTION?

00:02:16.135 --> 00:02:19.539

00:02:19.572 --> 00:02:21.707
SO I WAS LIKE, "THIS NIGGA
MUST BE JOKING, MAN."

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.876
I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE'S GOING
WITH THIS AND S**T.

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:26.179
BUT HE WAS DEAD SERIOUS.

00:02:26.212 --> 00:02:28.214

FUNNY-ASS S**T."

00:02:35.487 --> 00:02:36.989
SO THEY COME OUT, RIGHT?

00:02:37.022 --> 00:02:38.724
AND I LOOK AT THEM,

00:02:38.757 --> 00:02:42.095
THEY STILL GOT ON THE SAME S**T

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:50.870
IT WAS WILD, AND I WAS LIKE,

00:02:50.903 --> 00:02:53.072
"I KNOW THEY AIN'T THINKING
ABOUT PLAYING BALL IN THAT,"

00:02:53.105 --> 00:02:54.106
BUT THEY WERE.

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:55.408
I SAID, "HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?"

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:57.143
YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE
GONNA CALL THIS?

00:02:57.176 --> 00:02:58.878

AGAINST THE BLOUSES.

00:02:58.911 --> 00:03:01.847
[laughter]

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.418
AND WHEN I SAID THAT,
THIS LOOK CAME ON HIS FACE.

00:03:05.451 --> 00:03:08.387
HE ICE GRILLED ME.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.289
AND I'M LOOKING BACK AT HIM,
THINKING TO MYSELF,

"WHAT ARE YOU ANGRY ABOUT?

00:03:11.991 --> 00:03:14.927
"I MEAN, YOU KNOW WHERE
YOU GOT THAT SHIRT FROM,

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.029
AND IT DAMN SURE WASN'T
THE MEN'S DEPARTMENT."

00:03:17.062 --> 00:03:18.798
I MEAN, I KIND OF
LEARNED SOMETHING THAT DAY:

00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:21.334
