00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.460
So why is DNS vulnerable in the first

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.900
place? So the fundamental reason is that the resolvers

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.350
that issue the DNS query trust the responses that

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.620
are received after they send out a query regardless

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.360
of where that response comes from. So sometimes these

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.350
responses can be forged. When a resolver sends out

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.780
a query, it typically generates what's called a race

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.190
condition And if the attacker replies before the legitimate

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.060
responder, then the resolver is likely to

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.830
believe the attacker. DNS responses can also

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.420
contain additional DNS information that's unrelated to

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.310
the query. The fundamental problem. Is that the

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.360
basic DNS protocols have no means for

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.280
authenticating responses. This allows an attacker to forge

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.980
responses after a resolver sends a query.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.570
A secondary reason that these types of spoofed

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.130
replies are possible is that DNS queries

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.340
are typically connectionless unlike BGP where routing messages

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.190
are transmitted. Over a reliable TCP connection, UDP

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.190
queries are sent over a connectionless UDP connection.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.720
Therefore, a resolver does not have a way

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.310
of mapping the response that it receives for

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.610
a query other than the query ID. Which can be forged by the attacker. Let's look

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.350
at how the combination of the lack of authentication and the

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.460
connectionless nature of a DNS query allows the possibility of cash poisoning.
