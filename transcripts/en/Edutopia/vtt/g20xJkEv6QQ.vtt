00:00:00.036 --> 00:00:02.106
&gt;&gt;Cathrine: Can somebody read
that learning target for me?

00:00:02.326 --> 00:00:06.946
&gt;&gt;Student: I can participate wholly and
mindfully in my book club discussion.

00:00:07.186 --> 00:00:10.836
&gt;&gt;Dr Cantor: When teachers
enable choice, they're setting

00:00:10.836 --> 00:00:15.756
in motion a child's ability to
direct interest towards something

00:00:15.756 --> 00:00:17.226
that matters to them.

00:00:17.226 --> 00:00:20.966
If we can capitalize on the
interests that a child has,

00:00:21.576 --> 00:00:25.646
what we've done is taken some of
the difficulty out of learning it.

00:00:25.646 --> 00:00:31.002
&gt;&gt;Student: In my book, I Am Malala,
their city that they live in is in war.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.916
&gt;&gt;Dr Cantor: We want students to
push their developmental range.

00:00:41.046 --> 00:00:43.666
We don't want them to shut
down and be discouraged,

00:00:44.026 --> 00:00:48.036
but at the same time we want to push
them to the greatest level of challenge

00:00:48.036 --> 00:00:49.936
that they can do with confidence.

00:00:59.056 --> 00:01:00.706
&gt;&gt;Cathrine: Oh, book
choice is everything

00:01:00.706 --> 00:01:02.026
for getting a lot of kids to read.

00:01:02.026 --> 00:01:05.816
&gt;&gt;Student: In my book, Does My Head
Look Big in This, people have started

00:01:05.816 --> 00:01:10.606
to accept Amal for her
choice to wear the hijab.

00:01:10.606 --> 00:01:13.306
&gt;&gt;Cathrine: I give them about ten
different books to choose from.

00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:17.646
I tried to include different themes
that I thought would resonate.

00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:20.876
When they choose their book,
we use a protocol called PICK.

00:01:21.546 --> 00:01:25.276
The P is whether they
understand the book's purpose.

00:01:25.976 --> 00:01:30.546
The I is to reflect on their
interest level in the book's topic.

00:01:30.976 --> 00:01:32.646
The C is comprehension.

00:01:32.646 --> 00:01:36.076
If they open it up and read a passage,
do they remember what they read?

00:01:36.206 --> 00:01:37.486
That shows comprehension.

00:01:37.866 --> 00:01:40.626
The K is for do they know the words.

00:01:41.196 --> 00:01:44.476
When they read, are there more than
five words that they don't know?

00:01:44.476 --> 00:01:45.466
That book is too hard.

00:01:45.976 --> 00:01:50.466
So we go through the PICK process for
students to choose a book that they like

00:01:50.516 --> 00:01:52.326
but also is at their reading level.

00:01:52.916 --> 00:01:55.876
&gt;&gt;Dr Cantor: Their choice of a
book can give a teacher a sense

00:01:56.146 --> 00:02:00.166
of where they feel competent, and
also give the teacher insights

00:02:00.486 --> 00:02:03.176
about where it would be
important to push them.

00:02:03.466 --> 00:02:06.086
&gt;&gt;Teacher: I feel like it's a
good way to get to know them,

00:02:06.086 --> 00:02:08.326
and it's a good way to
know how they're doing.

00:02:08.446 --> 00:02:12.536
In addition to that, it gives
me a look inside of their minds.

00:02:12.726 --> 00:02:16.566
Being able to choose your own book
means that that book is special to you,

00:02:16.566 --> 00:02:19.206
and you take it home and
it feels like your friend,

00:02:19.246 --> 00:02:20.746
if you've chosen it yourself.
