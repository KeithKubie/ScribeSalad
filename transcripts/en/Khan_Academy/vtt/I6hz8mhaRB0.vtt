00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.580
Identify the hypothesis and
conclusion of the following

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.760
statement, and determine whether
the statement is

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.130
always, sometimes,
or never true.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.970
And the statement here is, the
absolute value of x is greater

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.260
than 0 for all real numbers x.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.580
Now if I want to decide what the
hypothesis and conclusion

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.610
is here, it's usually a lot
easier to figure them out if

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.110
you rewrite this statement, this
exact statement, as an

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.080
if/then statement.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.510
So what this statement is saying
is, if x is a real

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.360
number, then the absolute value
of x is greater than 0.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.710
So let me rewrite that.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:47.480
If x is a real number, then
the absolute value of x is

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.420
greater than 0.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.170
These are equivalent
statements.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.500
Now when you write it like
this, it's much easier to

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.100
identify the hypothesis
and the conclusion.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.730
The hypothesis you can view as
it's the if part of this

00:00:58.730 --> 00:00:59.400
proposition.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.460
So this right here is
the hypothesis.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.890
x is a real number.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.274
That is the hypothesis.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.030
And the conclusion
is the then part.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.020
Sometimes it's called
the consequent.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.115
It's this part right here.

00:01:16.115 --> 00:01:17.100
It's this part, x.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.480
Absolute value of x
is greater than 0.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.750
This is the conclusion
or the consequent.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.830
And over here, if you wanted
to circle them, this is the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.130
conclusion.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.130
That is the conclusion.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.940
And the hypothesis is for
all real numbers.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.430
It's a little bit easier to
identify when you see it

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.270
written like this.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.730
This is the hypothesis.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.300
Now I don't want you to get
confused with the idea of a

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.320
scientific hypothesis,
which is related but

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.670
a little bit different.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.610
A scientific hypothesis is an
explanation for some phenomena

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:49.860
that can be tested.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.290
So a scientific hypothesis
might be something like

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.720
saying, blueberries-- which
I'm writing in blue

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.740
intentionally.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.970
Blueberries help reduce
the risk of cancer.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.940
This right here is a scientific
hypothesis.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.430
You could then go feed a bunch
of people blueberries for a

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.210
long period of time and see if
they have a less likelihood of

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.490
developing cancer than people
who never got blueberries and

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:19.550
everything else is equal.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:20.890
And so it would be testable.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.000
You could see if it's true.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.430
And the conclusion would be
whether this is true or not.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.880
But this is in the scientific
hypothesis world, not to be

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.690
confused with the notion
of hypothesis that

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:31.530
we're using right now.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.940
And I don't want to confuse
you too much, so I'm just

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.440
going to leave this
on the side here.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.630
But when you're in Algebra I
and especially-- these are

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.780
according to the California
standards.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.010
The hypothesis in this context
is the antecedent of this

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.660
proposition.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.880
Or it's the if part of
this proposition.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.580
Now, the more interesting
question is

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.520
whether it is true.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.610
I mean, we can sit and label
statements all day, but that's

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:53.380
not interesting.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.430
The more fundamental thing is,
is this a true statement?

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.120
Is it true that if x is a real
number, then the absolute

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.540
value of x is greater than 0?

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.890
Well the one number that pops
out of my mind that disproves

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.190
this is if x is 0.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.590
0 is a real number.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.940
That's true.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.350
But-- and I'll write
but in caps.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.440
BUT the absolute value
of 0 is equal to 0.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.320
It's not greater than 0.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.140
So this disproves
this statement.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.300
It's definitely not
always true.

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.120
Now, if you pretty much have
any other real number, this

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.010
will be true.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.580
Because any other real number is
some distance away from 0.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.300
That's what the absolute
value measures.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.035
So if you took a 1 or a negative
1 or whatever, the

00:03:43.035 --> 00:03:45.150
absolute value of those
are greater than 0.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.250
So this is sometimes true.
