00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.210
Hemoglobin molecules normally stick together and interact with each

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.650
other and they're packed into a very small space

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.660
to carry lots of oxygen, like you see on

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.270
the left. We call this normal hemoglobin data, we

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.586
call it the HbA allele. But the glutamate to

00:00:14.586 --> 00:00:17.150
valine mutation which we refer to as the HBS

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.730
allele, causes the overall hemoglobin molecule to stick together

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.350
more than it normally does. And this abnormal interaction

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.190
of sticking together more than it normally does,

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.790
leads to these elongated stretches of hemoglobin molecules.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.890
This has the effect of altering the shape

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.080
of the red blood cell from this sort of

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.760
more oval rounded shape. To this elongated sickle

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.800
shape here. So in this scenario do you think

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.310
that the HbS allele, the mutant allele is

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.670
an example of a loss of function, a gain

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.360
of function, or a no change in function allele?
