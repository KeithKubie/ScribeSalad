00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.390
We've done several
videos already

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:05.330
where we're approximating
the area under a curve

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.870
by breaking up that
area into rectangles

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.417
and then finding the sum of
the areas of those rectangles

00:00:12.417 --> 00:00:13.250
as an approximation.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.750
And this was actually
the first example

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.410
that we looked at where
each of the rectangles

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:19.480
had an equal width.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.940
So we equally
partitioned the interval

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.790
between our two boundaries
between a and b.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.210
And the height of the
rectangle was the function

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.570
evaluated at the left
endpoint of each rectangle.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.300
And we wanted to generalize it
and write it in sigma notation.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.110
It looked something like this.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.090
And this was one case.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.720
Later on, we looked
at a situation

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.130
where you define the
height by the function

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.140
value at the right endpoint
or at the midpoint.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.190
And then we even
constructed trapezoids.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.190
And these are all particular
instances of Riemann sums.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.784
So this right over
here is a Riemann sum.

00:00:54.784 --> 00:00:56.450
And when people talk
about Riemann sums,

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.790
they're talking about
the more general notion.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.040
You don't have to
just do it this way.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.300
You could use trapezoids.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.690
You don't even have to have
equally-spaced partitions.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.400
I used equally-spaced partitions
because it made things

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.850
a little bit
conceptually simpler.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.720
And this right here is
a picture of the person

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.320
that Riemann sums
was named after.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.510
This is Bernhard Riemann.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.086
And he made many
contributions to mathematics.

00:01:18.086 --> 00:01:19.710
But what he is most
known for, at least

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.626
if you're taking a
first-year calculus course,

00:01:21.626 --> 00:01:23.090
is the Riemann sum.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.600
And how this is used to
define the Riemann integral.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.350
Both Newton and
Leibniz had come up

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.030
with the idea of
the integral when

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.760
they had formulated calculus,
but the Riemann integral

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.260
is kind of the most
mainstream formal,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.500
or I would say
rigorous, definition

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.480
of what an integral is.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.790
So as you could imagine, this is
one instance of a Riemann sum.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.730
We have n right over here.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.710
The larger n is, the better an
approximation it's going to be.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.130
So his definition of
an integral, which

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.020
is the actual area
under the curve,

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.230
or his definition of a
definite integral, which

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.400
is the actual area under
a curve between a and b

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.310
is to take this Riemann sum,
it doesn't have to be this one,

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.139
take any Riemann sum, and
take the limit as n approaches

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.819
infinity.

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.360
So just to be clear,
what's happening

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.940
when n approaches infinity?

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.130
Let me draw another
diagram here.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.440
So let's say that's my y-axis.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.670
This is my x-axis.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.060
This is my function.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.300
As n approaches
infinity-- so this is a,

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.510
this is b-- you're just going
to have a ton of rectangles.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.382
You're just going to get a
ton of rectangles over there.

00:02:32.382 --> 00:02:34.340
And there are going to
become better and better

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.430
approximations for
the actual area.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.640
And the actual area
under the curve

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:50.410
is denoted by the integral
from a to b of f of x times dx.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.936
And you see where
this is coming from

00:02:52.936 --> 00:02:54.310
or how these
notations are close.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.810
Or at least in my brain,
how they're connected.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:04.080
Delta x was the width for
each of these sections.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.430
This right here is delta x.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.350
So that is a delta x.

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.390
This is another delta x.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.320
This is another delta x.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.300
A reasonable way to
conceptualize what dx is,

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.150
or what a differential
is, is what delta x

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.060
approaches, if it
becomes infinitely small.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.592
So you can conceptualize
this, and it's not

00:03:22.592 --> 00:03:24.300
a very rigorous way
of thinking about it,

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:38.070
is an infinitely small-- but
not 0-- infinitely small delta

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.710
x, is one way that you
can conceptualize this.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.760
So once again, as you
have your function

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.270
times a little small
change in delta x.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:47.890
And you are summing,
although you're

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.520
summing an infinite number
of these things, from a to b.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.020
So I'm going to
leave you there just

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.890
so that you see the connection.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.348
You know the name
for these things.

00:03:56.348 --> 00:03:58.730
And once again, this
one over here, this

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:59.890
isn't the only Riemann sum.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.050
In fact, this is often
called the left Riemann sum

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.250
if you're using it
with rectangles.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.541
You can do a right Riemann sum.

00:04:04.541 --> 00:04:05.780
You could use the midpoint.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:06.660
You could use a trapezoid.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.951
But if you take the limit of
any of those Riemann sums,

00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:11.080
as n approaches
infinity, then that you

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.160
get as a Riemann
definition of the integral.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.640
Now so far, we haven't
talked about how

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.440
to actually evaluate this thing.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.600
This is just a
definition right now.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.130
And for that we will
do in future videos.
