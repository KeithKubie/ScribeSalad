I'm serious. Hey, I'm Chad at boom rod. I am Robert Pillory. This is radio lab,

15
00:00:51.471 --> 00:00:52.290
the podcast.

16
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.290
And today on the podcast a story about a friendship really cause in almost any

17
00:00:57.441 --> 00:00:59.780
friendship, there'll be a moment where you look across it.

18
00:00:59.781 --> 00:01:02.240
This person you think you know very, very well,

19
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.290
and he or she will suddenly say something or do something or think something

20
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.350
that just throws everything into question. Everything up in the air.

21
00:01:09.351 --> 00:01:11.540
You think of what will you at.

22
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.730
This is a friendship with a big fat what in it?

23
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.060
And the guy that's going to tell us the story is, uh,

24
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.140
Andy Mills and I am a freelance radio producer and the other guy,

25
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.590
you meet him in a minute. So maybe we should just like how did you meet Mike?

26
00:01:24.591 --> 00:01:26.870
What was the, where did you lay eyes on each other? Well,

27
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.720
<v 3>it was my sophomore year of college and it was the time that the freshmen are</v>

28
00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:36.930
all moving into the dorms and I was meeting new people welcoming the freshman.

29
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.480
Oh, you're an ra or you're some sort of no, no,

30
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.780
just one of those chatty a people in the dorm and you're like, what's your name?

31
00:01:42.781 --> 00:01:47.730
Exactly. And as I was talking actually to a group of freshmen in my room,

32
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.150
I hear this like strange noise from the room next door.

33
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.590
There's this kind of low drone.

34
00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.840
So I kind of peeked over and saw,

35
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:01.703
you know,

36
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.120
18 to 19 year old kid in a wheelchair,

37
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.100
dark curly hair.

38
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.970
<v 1>And um,</v>

39
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.750
<v 3>this noise I had been hearing was his voice.</v>

40
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.450
Not even a week later I run into him in the hallway and I introduced myself.

41
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.400
I say, hi, I'm Andy,

42
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.810
<v 1>what's your name? And he said,</v>

43
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.170
<v 4>my name is Colin. Ah,</v>

44
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.490
mu. Hey Yo. [inaudible]

45
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.330
<v 1>con Ashmore Con Ashmore. Yeah,</v>

46
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.990
I was on the way to eat lunch and I invited him to join me.

47
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.230
<v 3>We sit down in the corner and I noticed like he brings the fork to his mouth,</v>

48
00:02:48.231 --> 00:02:53.180
like really slowly everything about him is, is slowed down,

49
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.510
but also noticed like he's witty, observant.

50
00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.060
And so at a point in the conversation I asked him

51
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.390
what's wrong? Like, why, why do you move and talk so slowly?

52
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.450
You just asked him flat out. Yeah. Was He offended?

53
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:13.763
<v 6>Yeah,</v>

54
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.700
<v 3>no, I think he was,</v>

55
00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.470
he was relieved to find somebody who was willing to admit that it's a little bit

56
00:03:21.471 --> 00:03:25.820
weird. Yeah. And then he tells me this story

57
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.420
tool. He started at the beginning

58
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.150
[inaudible] 10 he said I was eight years old.

59
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.230
<v 4>Oh, sorry. Oh was, yeah. In the</v>

60
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.430
[inaudible]

61
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.320
<v 3>I had this dog, the dog had run off, Bro.</v>

62
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.440
Couteau is Jane.

63
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.550
I ran out into the street and

64
00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.340
the next thing I knew I was waking up from a coma. Yeah.

65
00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.320
Five one five months later, he got hit by a car. Yeah.

66
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.900
And when you woke up, what did that be to you? What,

67
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.600
what were the injuries that you suffered?

68
00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:10.170
<v 4>Well,</v>

69
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.170
I could [inaudible] I could move

70
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.410
<v 3>and then he comes out of it slowly and slowly. But thing is he,</v>

71
00:04:21.411 --> 00:04:24.660
he stays low. Whoa. Slow.

72
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.320
Very slow. So this is a man who is slowed down globally, right?

73
00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:35.310
Except for, of course his mind. Hmm. Really? Oh yeah, he does well in school.

74
00:04:35.311 --> 00:04:37.950
He's smart. He has a great sense of humor.

75
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.890
And we connected, you know,

76
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.580
I was his neighbor in the dorm and we had a lot in common,

77
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.940
like a lot of the same music used to stay up late.

78
00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.230
I'd play my acoustic guitar and he would sing matchbox 20 songs from the 90s.

79
00:04:52.231 --> 00:04:55.050
You know, he would you, uh, do you, you must slow down your playing.

80
00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.280
Is that my playing is not exactly a rockstar material or anything.

81
00:04:59.281 --> 00:05:01.040
I love that song. I think,

82
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:06.070
I know it wasn't long before we ended up having these really deep conversations

83
00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.890
in the middle of the night, but what, well,

84
00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.590
the fact that both of our parents are divorced and how we both grew up in

85
00:05:13.591 --> 00:05:17.060
households that were fighting all the time and having to sleep at grandma's.

86
00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.500
Is it like a regular part of both of our lives?

87
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.320
Kahn's parents started fighting a lot after he came out of the coma.

88
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.800
The mom blamed the dad for not watching con and yeah,

89
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.370
we talked a lot about how like that impacted our life growing up and we just

90
00:05:35.371 --> 00:05:40.170
became really close to level situation.

91
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.020
Tell me what you had for breakfast today. You know,

92
00:05:43.021 --> 00:05:45.690
I've known Khan for almost a decade. Um,

93
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.560
but it wasn't until last summer that I decided to interview con on tape and it

94
00:05:52.501 --> 00:05:57.501
was in the middle of this interview that Khan tells me this story that changed

95
00:05:57.891 --> 00:05:57.980
the

96
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.150
<v 1>way that I think about Khan and his slowness. So,</v>

97
00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.710
um, the story starts off with him in junior high.

98
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.250
First big crush Julie, her name was Julie,

99
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.710
and he's trying to think of something romantic to do to catch your attention.

100
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.350
Oh, and he really loves music.

101
00:06:18.351 --> 00:06:21.150
He was listening to his Walkman one night and he realized that that's,

102
00:06:21.151 --> 00:06:22.910
that's what he wants to do. He would make her

103
00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.850
tape a romantic mixtape and that would be the thing.

104
00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:34.020
So he makes this tape and then he decided that [inaudible] Taj soon to actually

105
00:06:37.761 --> 00:06:42.140
sing. Oh, I'm so a love song to Julie.

106
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.690
So he writes the song records,

107
00:06:44.691 --> 00:06:48.560
it puts the tape back in the Stereo and

108
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:52.223
[inaudible]

109
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:01.603
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

110
00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.790
<v 1>my thing whole</v>

111
00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:18.680
[inaudible] he felt embarrassed. He felt confused, screaming,

112
00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:22.170
crying. Wait. Why? Well,

113
00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:27.680
it turns out that was the first time that he had ever heard his voice.

114
00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:32.400
The way that you and I hear his voice. And so wait, first time,

115
00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:36.720
what does that even mean? He never heard a recording of himself or, oh no,

116
00:07:36.721 --> 00:07:40.380
he had, not only had he never heard of recording of himself, but when he talks

117
00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.250
you march, help

118
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:49.530
girl hear you. What do you mean by that,

119
00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.250
Lord? I mean,

120
00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:57.990
he tells me that he actually didn't know that his voice was slow.

121
00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.510
How's that even possible? I mean,

122
00:08:00.511 --> 00:08:05.450
does that mean his brain is speeding up his voice but not yours? Yeah,

123
00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:10.460
he hears me talk normal and then he hears himself talk normal as well.

124
00:08:11.371 --> 00:08:14.700
Like you think he's slow in speeding up or do you think he just thinks he's

125
00:08:14.701 --> 00:08:17.760
regular? It's not like he speeds both of us. Doesn't mean that your,

126
00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:21.690
your voice just or his voice just feels normal or does he mean it actually

127
00:08:21.691 --> 00:08:23.730
sounds, it sounds exactly the same.

128
00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.940
This one I'm saying like he thinks he sounds here right now.

129
00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:28.710
He would hear you talk, you hear me talk.

130
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.630
Then he would say something and then his head,

131
00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.230
it's all the same speed but that doesn't make sense cause it's like variable

132
00:08:34.231 --> 00:08:37.920
speed, you know? I don't think he's, no, I think he thinks he's just normal.

133
00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.440
I'm normal inside. So we went back and forth,

134
00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:42.860
back and forth on this and until finally this,

135
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.840
we need a specialist at this point. Yes, we will take our positions there.

136
00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.750
Ready. We ended up calling this guy who we've had on the show before. All right,

137
00:08:49.751 --> 00:08:54.110
so Andy orange here, or in Devinsky neurologists. NYU Medical Center.

138
00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:59.100
He's the doctor. Hi. Hi. Oren does Orrin does or know anything? I know.

139
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:03.780
Yeah. I listen. I'm college educated. I mean,

140
00:09:03.781 --> 00:09:07.150
not this. Anyhow, Andy ran them through the whole story. Yeah. Um,

141
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:10.250
well he was eight years old and he was a belief. I leave.

142
00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.380
I always think you've just heard. And here was the orange reaction. Yeah.

143
00:09:13.381 --> 00:09:16.860
So I guess I, you know, just, it's, it's a fascinating case.

144
00:09:16.861 --> 00:09:21.090
And my first clinical question would be, did he know he moved slowly,

145
00:09:21.091 --> 00:09:22.260
but absolutely. Yeah.

146
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:26.730
But it was only for his own voice that he was unaware that he was different than

147
00:09:26.731 --> 00:09:30.240
everybody else. Right. So he does have feedback on himself.

148
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:34.920
The one area he's not getting feedback on is his voice production, which,

149
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:38.970
which interestingly happens in post encephalitic Parkinson's patients.

150
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.060
They're slow in all their movements. They're slow getting up out of a chair,

151
00:09:42.061 --> 00:09:44.610
they're slow walking. But as with con,

152
00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:48.900
there are some cases where they just get little focal areas that they don't see

153
00:09:48.901 --> 00:09:52.380
their slowness. So Oliver Sacks, when he took care of his awakenings,

154
00:09:52.381 --> 00:09:56.850
patients at Beth Abraham hospital in the Bronx would sometimes record their

155
00:09:56.851 --> 00:10:00.470
voices and play it back and they'd say, that's not me. You're,

156
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:01.950
you're fiddling with the tape machine.

157
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.480
That's not my voice because the voice to them would sound too slow. Too slow.

158
00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:11.040
Too slow. Yeah, that's exactly. Do you think his inner voice,

159
00:10:11.041 --> 00:10:14.370
his inner mental speed is truly as fast or as that also?

160
00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:19.340
<v 3>Oh, it's absolutely normal. Okay. Khan and I both went to a Christian college.</v>

161
00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:24.730
We both made an exodus from that kind of fundamentalist Christian world at

162
00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.800
around the same time, which involved, uh, you know,

163
00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:31.940
long talks about what we believe and what we think we might believe next.

164
00:10:31.941 --> 00:10:34.070
And there was never a point where I was having to like,

165
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:37.370
wait for Khan to make some, you know,

166
00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.040
mental exercise before you'd respond.

167
00:10:40.041 --> 00:10:42.650
And those are some pretty complex things dealing with faith.

168
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:46.220
<v 1>What I don't understand fully is why he hears you,</v>

169
00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:50.900
Andy speaking at three times his pace and feel your normal,

170
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:55.010
but something about his own voice feeding back to his own brain.

171
00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:59.960
He never perceived that at a different speed than your voice in everyone else's.

172
00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:03.460
Do you then trust [inaudible]? Do you wonder about maybe,

173
00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:07.130
would you suspect that if you met him, you'd learn something different than you?

174
00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:11.000
Yeah, no. In medicine you should always trust the patient's report,

175
00:11:11.001 --> 00:11:13.400
but keep in the back of your head a drop of skepticism.

176
00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:16.610
But my gut as a clinician is more than 95% it's real.

177
00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:23.670
<v 3>Now, keep in mind that was on a true clinical diagnosis.</v>

178
00:11:23.671 --> 00:11:27.360
That was just Orrin Devinsky giving us his gut opinion. What? I have a theory.

179
00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:31.390
I have a theory. Unscientific though it may be. Well that's,

180
00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:32.710
that's what we specialize.

181
00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:38.100
I think that it has something to do with familiarity.

182
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:42.180
Like when I first met con and I heard his voice,

183
00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:44.560
it was so foreign and so strange and I,

184
00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:48.320
and I could hardly make out what he was saying, but now I'm,

185
00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:50.820
I'm surprised when people say, what did you just say?

186
00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.930
And I think what he just said, he's horrified you. I interest, I'm,

187
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:58.180
I've grown so familiar to his voice that it is it sort of like going into a

188
00:11:58.181 --> 00:12:00.430
Shakespeare play in an act one scene, one acquisitions.

189
00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:01.420
You don't know what's going on.

190
00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:03.880
But somehow in the second act two begins to click. Exactly.

191
00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:07.720
It's that familiarity. And if I have it, I mean, imagine what he must have.

192
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:08.583
Yeah.

193
00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:11.600
<v 4>Oh, hi. Cruel. No</v>

194
00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.620
dumb toe

195
00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:19.610
<v 3>hearing. So being present.</v>

196
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:24.440
But what I don't get is like, we just went on for years. So how, how,

197
00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:28.640
could note how come no one told him his parents and his siblings and his friends

198
00:12:28.641 --> 00:12:31.580
have never turned him into, hey, what, you know, come on, speed it up.

199
00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:35.810
They've never ever said that. No. His parents being deaf, you know,

200
00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:38.330
crossed them out. They couldn't have told him. His parents are deaf,

201
00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:39.253
both of them.

202
00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:43.640
[inaudible] and Khan thinks that everyone else just assumed that he knew what

203
00:12:43.641 --> 00:12:45.620
his own voice sounded like. Really?

204
00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:52.580
Like when you talk to him, to his friends. Hey Hayley. Hey, hello? Hey Dave.

205
00:12:52.581 --> 00:12:54.410
What's up? Oh, not much with the band. I mean,

206
00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.410
and you told them the whole thing. What was their reaction? Honestly,

207
00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:02.150
most of them didn't believe me. You're kidding. Huh? Did you know this at all?

208
00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:08.060
No, I had no idea. I didn't know that. And so his, when he speaks,

209
00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:13.100
he just thinks that it sounds just like anyone else. Yeah,

210
00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:13.963
that's what I'm telling you.

211
00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.970
That's so sad. Yeah.

212
00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.570
[inaudible] so after he found out about his voice,

213
00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:27.550
which I guess was the one thing he thought was normal, um,

214
00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:32.080
<v 4>what did he do well, he said,</v>

215
00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:36.940
I'm never boot gun talk again.

216
00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:41.600
<v 6>Um,</v>

217
00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:45.380
<v 3>did he, did he talk again? Obviously he did. Right?</v>

218
00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:47.390
Well that's the same question I asked him.

219
00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:50.720
After you heard that you were different,

220
00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:54.770
how long did you go before talking again? And he told me,

221
00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:57.870
<v 4>are you</v>

222
00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:04.290
going back to Google?

223
00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:09.130
<v 3>And he, he doesn't recall like the first conversation exactly that he had,</v>

224
00:14:09.131 --> 00:14:11.770
but he thinks that was something like,

225
00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:14.270
<v 4>sure. Uh, Pan</v>

226
00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:18.660
[inaudible] hello.

227
00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.360
<v 3>He didn't want to talk,</v>

228
00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:24.990
but gradually he realized that he kind of had to. Hmm.

229
00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:28.490
And what about singing? He said he, he liked to sing.

230
00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:35.800
Well eventually he got comfortable again with the idea of having his voice

231
00:14:36.501 --> 00:14:41.300
recorded, his singing voice recorded. And so after the interview was over,

232
00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:45.440
he mentioned the song that he actually had been singing a lot and so I turned

233
00:14:45.441 --> 00:14:49.130
the recorder back on and asked if he would sing it for me. So

234
00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:52.070
tell me name of the song

235
00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:55.670
<v 1>and then just the same way the series,</v>

236
00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:56.950
<v 6>Huh?</v>

237
00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:57.540
<v 1>Good.</v>

238
00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:02.540
I [inaudible] by day mean ice,

239
00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:06.113
<v 6>Huh?</v>

240
00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:08.000
<v 1>Right. All right.</v>

241
00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:14.130
Then here a full salad on the

242
00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:22.040
Po. Hey, no girl, girl.

243
00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:25.653
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

244
00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:30.220
<v 1>it was actually pretty emotional first both day.</v>

245
00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:34.590
And as I'm sitting there hearing him sing this song,

246
00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:40.480
Hey, I'm just wondering like what does this sound like in his head? Right.

247
00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:42.030
So after I got the tape recorded,

248
00:15:42.031 --> 00:15:45.900
I brought it back to my friends in Chicago and a band called Hudson branch and

249
00:15:45.901 --> 00:15:49.590
all of them know Khan because John and I asked them like,

250
00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:53.130
do you think that we could maybe play some music to this?

251
00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:58.380
So the music could kind of give us a peak into the way the con hears it and the

252
00:15:58.381 --> 00:16:01.250
way the con feels written. Maybe we could feel it too.

253
00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.353
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

254
00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:15.920
<v 1>well, all right here.</v>

255
00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:26.200
Sorry, Dawn. The [inaudible]

256
00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:38.550
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

257
00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:42.210
<v 6>good. Hey. Hey.</v>

258
00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:43.663
<v 8>Hmm.</v>

259
00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:36.673
<v 9>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

260
00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:39.523
<v 6>great.</v>

261
00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:42.793
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

262
00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:46.640
<v 1>Huh? What did Khan say when he heard it, by the way?</v>

263
00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:50.490
Did it remind him of anything like what he feels? Yeah, I mean,

264
00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:53.700
when he heard it he said, hell yes.

265
00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:59.350
<v 9>Yeah, no, he loves it.</v>

266
00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:06.190
<v 1>Thanks to producer Andy Mills, who just received a,</v>

267
00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.670
an award at the third coast festival for a shorter version of that piece,

268
00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:14.160
and thanks also of course, to Khan Ashmore and the mayor. Yeah.

269
00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:19.420
Andy m met bold Jacob Bowl, Corey beaner, Coby bean, beaners, Becky Bailey,

270
00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:22.060
he not Kim, they call themselves Pachin branch.

271
00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:26.050
Becky joined them out to be bold, bold, meaner, and meaner. Can Bailey, right?

272
00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:28.550
You know, Hudson branch could be the name of, or a rock band.

273
00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:32.500
That's also a law firm. Anyhow, you can find out more about
