00:00:06.704 --> 00:00:09.444
A banker in London sends the latest stock info

00:00:09.444 --> 00:00:12.459
to his colleagues in Hong Kong in less than a second.

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:14.759
With a single click, a customer in New York

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.854
orders electronics made in Beijing,

00:00:16.854 --> 00:00:19.082
transported across the ocean within days

00:00:19.082 --> 00:00:21.603
by cargo plane or container ship.

00:00:21.603 --> 00:00:23.650
The speed and volume at which goods and information

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.486
move across the world today is unprecedented in history.

00:00:27.486 --> 00:00:30.581
But global exchange itself is older than we think,

00:00:30.581 --> 00:00:34.170
reaching back over 2,000 years along a 5,000 mile stretch

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.521
known as the Silk Road.

00:00:36.521 --> 00:00:39.065
The Silk Road wasn't actually a single road,

00:00:39.065 --> 00:00:41.134
but a network of multiple routes

00:00:41.134 --> 00:00:43.494
that gradually emerged over centuries,

00:00:43.494 --> 00:00:45.934
connecting to various settlements and to each other

00:00:45.934 --> 00:00:47.311
thread by thread.

00:00:47.311 --> 00:00:51.045
The first agricultural civilizations were isolated places

00:00:51.045 --> 00:00:52.615
in fertile river valleys,

00:00:52.615 --> 00:00:54.905
their travel impeded by surrounding geography

00:00:54.905 --> 00:00:56.521
and fear of the unknown.

00:00:56.521 --> 00:00:57.744
But as they grew,

00:00:57.744 --> 00:01:00.541
they found that the arid deserts and steps on their borders

00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:02.868
were inhabited, not by the demons of folklore,

00:01:02.868 --> 00:01:05.234
but nomadic tribes on horseback.

00:01:05.234 --> 00:01:08.258
The Scythians, who ranged from Hungary to Mongolia,

00:01:08.258 --> 00:01:10.121
had come in contact with the civilizations of

00:01:10.121 --> 00:01:13.129
Greece, Egypt, India and China.

00:01:13.129 --> 00:01:15.517
These encounters were often less than peaceful.

00:01:15.517 --> 00:01:17.891
But even through raids and warfare,

00:01:17.891 --> 00:01:20.719
as well as trade and protection of traveling merchants

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:22.256
in exchange for tariffs,

00:01:22.256 --> 00:01:25.775
the nomads began to spread goods, ideas and technologies

00:01:25.775 --> 00:01:28.576
between cultures with no direct contact.

00:01:28.576 --> 00:01:31.591
One of the most important strands of this growing web

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:33.160
was the Persian Royal Road,

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.993
completed by Darius the First in the 5th century BCE.

00:01:36.993 --> 00:01:41.399
Stretching nearly 2,000 miles from the Tigris River to the Aegean Sea,

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:43.937
its regular relay points allowed goods and messages

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:48.251
to travel at nearly 1/10 the time it would take a single traveler.

00:01:48.251 --> 00:01:50.965
With Alexander the Great's conquest of Persia,

00:01:50.965 --> 00:01:54.699
and expansion into Central Asia through capturing cities like Samarkand,

00:01:54.699 --> 00:01:57.994
and establishing new ones like Alexandria Eschate,

00:01:57.994 --> 00:02:01.563
the network of Greek, Egyptian, Persian and Indian culture and trade

00:02:01.563 --> 00:02:04.455
extended farther east than ever before,

00:02:04.455 --> 00:02:07.978
laying the foundations for a bridge between China and the West.

00:02:07.978 --> 00:02:11.029
This was realized in the 2nd century BCE,

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:13.306
when an ambassador named Zhang Qian,

00:02:13.306 --> 00:02:15.517
sent to negotiate with nomads in the West,

00:02:15.517 --> 00:02:17.605
returned to the Han Emperor with tales of

00:02:17.605 --> 00:02:20.709
sophisticated civilizations, prosperous trade

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.909
and exotic goods beyond the western borders.

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:26.313
Ambassadors and merchants were sent towards

00:02:26.313 --> 00:02:29.943
Persia and India to trade silk and jade for horses and cotton,

00:02:29.943 --> 00:02:32.864
along with armies to secure their passage.

00:02:32.864 --> 00:02:35.358
Eastern and western routes gradually linked together

00:02:35.358 --> 00:02:38.323
into an integrated system spanning Eurasia,

00:02:38.323 --> 00:02:40.240
enabling cultural and commercial exhange

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.506
farther than ever before.

00:02:42.506 --> 00:02:44.736
Chinese goods made their way to Rome,

00:02:44.736 --> 00:02:48.281
causing an outflow of gold that led to a ban on silk,

00:02:48.281 --> 00:02:51.430
while Roman glassware was highly prized in China.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.892
Military expeditions in Central Asia

00:02:53.892 --> 00:02:57.267
also saw encounters between Chinese and Roman soldiers.

00:02:57.267 --> 00:02:59.547
Possibly even transmitting crossbow technology

00:02:59.547 --> 00:03:01.812
to the Western world.

00:03:01.812 --> 00:03:04.187
Demand for exotic and foreign goods

00:03:04.187 --> 00:03:05.389
and the profits they brought,

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:07.699
kept the strands of the Silk Road in tact,

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:09.989
even as the Roman Empire disintegrated

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.258
and Chinese dynasties rose and fell.

00:03:13.258 --> 00:03:16.151
Even Mongolian hoards, known for pillage and plunder,

00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:19.588
actively protected the trade routes, rather than disrupting them.

00:03:19.588 --> 00:03:22.642
But along with commodities, these routes also enabled

00:03:22.642 --> 00:03:27.087
the movement of traditions, innovations, ideologies and languages.

00:03:27.087 --> 00:03:30.644
Originating in India, Buddhism migrated to China and Japan

00:03:30.644 --> 00:03:32.989
to become the dominant religion there.

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.278
Islam spread from the Arabian Penninsula into South Asia,

00:03:36.278 --> 00:03:37.888
blending with native beliefs

00:03:37.888 --> 00:03:40.704
and leading to new faiths, like Sikhism.

00:03:40.704 --> 00:03:43.427
And gunpowder made its way from China to the Middle East

00:03:43.427 --> 00:03:48.258
forging the futures of the Ottoman, Safavid and Mughul Empires.

00:03:48.258 --> 00:03:51.214
In a way, the Silk Road's success led to its own demise

00:03:51.214 --> 00:03:54.272
as new maritime technologies, like the magnetic compass,

00:03:54.272 --> 00:03:57.990
found their way to Europe, making long land routes obsolete.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.622
Meanwhile, the collapse of Mongol rule

00:04:00.622 --> 00:04:04.032
was followed by China's withdrawal from international trade.

00:04:04.032 --> 00:04:06.851
But even though the old routes and networks did not last,

00:04:06.851 --> 00:04:08.936
they had changed the world forever

00:04:08.936 --> 00:04:10.848
and there was no going back.

00:04:10.848 --> 00:04:13.023
Europeans seeking new maritime routes

00:04:13.023 --> 00:04:15.639
to the riches they knew awaited in East Asia

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:17.381
led to the Age of Exploration

00:04:17.381 --> 00:04:20.488
and expansion into Africa and the Americas.

00:04:20.488 --> 00:04:24.286
Today, global interconnectedness shapes our lives like never before.

00:04:24.286 --> 00:04:27.557
Canadian shoppers buy t-shirts made in Bangladesh,

00:04:27.557 --> 00:04:30.500
Japanese audiences watch British television shows,

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.436
and Tunisians use American software to launch a revolution.

00:04:34.436 --> 00:04:38.577
The impact of globalization on culture and economy is indisputable.

00:04:38.577 --> 00:04:40.563
But whatever its benefits and drawbacks,

00:04:40.563 --> 00:04:43.246
it is far from a new phenomenon.

00:04:43.246 --> 00:04:45.501
And though the mountains, deserts and oceans

00:04:45.501 --> 00:04:46.688
that once separated us

00:04:46.688 --> 00:04:49.452
are now circumvented through super sonic vehicles,

00:04:49.452 --> 00:04:51.576
cross-continental communication cables,

00:04:51.576 --> 00:04:53.789
and signals beamed through space

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:56.116
rather than caravans traveling for months,

00:04:56.116 --> 00:04:57.863
none of it would have been possible

00:04:57.863 --> 00:04:59.385
without the pioneering cultures

00:04:59.385 --> 00:05:01.842
whose efforts created the Silk Road:

00:05:01.842 --> 00:05:04.115
history's first world wide web.
