00:00:05.504 --> 00:00:09.242
I just leaned
out of the kitchen...

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:13.879
Showed him the jar...

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:15.948
And right there,
next to his girl, he's all--

00:00:15.948 --> 00:00:17.216
[giggling]

00:00:17.216 --> 00:00:19.351

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.292
I'm your host, Ari Shaffir,

[cheers and applause]

A veteran of the show.
You guys have seen him.

00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:10.803
If you've seen the YouTube
clips, you've seen this guy.

00:01:10.803 --> 00:01:12.672
He's absolutely hilarious.
I'm glad he's back.

00:01:12.672 --> 00:01:14.940

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:22.481
- My first-ever apartment
was in New Orleans

00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:24.517
in the year 2002.

00:01:24.517 --> 00:01:28.287
My roommate and I
paid $535 even.

00:01:28.287 --> 00:01:30.156
Not individually.

00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:32.024
One lump sum,

00:01:32.024 --> 00:01:33.960
all utilities included.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.294
A two-bedroom, two-bath,

00:01:35.294 --> 00:01:37.663
two-balcony apartment.

00:01:37.663 --> 00:01:39.165
And I still remember, like,

00:01:39.165 --> 00:01:40.666
confronting our landlord,

00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:44.503
like, "Hey, can you shave off
that extra $5?

00:01:44.503 --> 00:01:47.507
Give us a chance to survive?"

00:01:52.811 --> 00:01:55.515
And I--we mo--
I moved in--

00:01:55.515 --> 00:01:57.183
I think everyone's first
roommate is a friend.

00:01:57.183 --> 00:01:59.318
Mine was not; I went
to high school with this guy.

00:01:59.318 --> 00:02:00.352
Didn't really know him.

00:02:00.352 --> 00:02:01.454
We moved in
in the morning,

00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:02.855
'cause it was all his shit.

00:02:02.855 --> 00:02:04.023
Nothing was mine.

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:07.126
or is that roommate,

00:02:07.126 --> 00:02:08.327
like, you got the couch.

00:02:08.327 --> 00:02:09.896
You have the TV;
you have the table.

00:02:09.896 --> 00:02:12.865
I have the mattress
and the box

00:02:12.865 --> 00:02:15.535
that I will reuse.

00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:19.639
But the previous tenant
had left us a gift, okay?

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:22.508
Now, by a round of applause,
who is not familiar

00:02:22.508 --> 00:02:25.844
with what is known
as Tony Chachere's?

00:02:25.844 --> 00:02:28.815
Not familiar, no.

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:31.217
Tony Chachere's--
it's a creole spice.

00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:32.818
It's, like, a Louisiana,

00:02:32.818 --> 00:02:34.554
New Orleans version
of an Old Bay.

00:02:34.554 --> 00:02:35.721
It's a--you put, you know,

00:02:35.721 --> 00:02:37.556
you put it on a old tennis shoe,

00:02:37.556 --> 00:02:39.358
and make it taste like
a filé gumbo.

00:02:39.358 --> 00:02:40.592
You know what I'm saying, y'all?

00:02:40.592 --> 00:02:42.528
You put it
on a rubber band sandwich,

00:02:42.528 --> 00:02:44.497
make it taste
like a shrimp po' boy.

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:45.698
Montalayo.

00:02:45.698 --> 00:02:47.166
[laughs]

00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:48.868
Jeez, I can't...

00:02:48.868 --> 00:02:51.670
side note--wait, let's put
the story aside for a second.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.739
That's a really fucking
annoying thing

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.841
about being
from southern Louisiana,

00:02:55.841 --> 00:02:58.411
is people are like,
"But where's your accent?"

00:02:58.411 --> 00:02:59.612
Like they want you to--

00:02:59.612 --> 00:03:01.080
"Oh, man, I tell--
boy, I tell you,

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.248
"the other day,
I went down there gator huntin',

00:03:03.248 --> 00:03:04.917
"and I cut me open a alligator,

00:03:04.917 --> 00:03:08.087
"and it--its tummy was
full of crawdads.

00:03:08.087 --> 00:03:09.455
"It was full of crawdads

00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:12.558
"that were hidin'
from Hurricane Katrina.

00:03:12.558 --> 00:03:14.861
"I was like, that storm done
gone all the crawdads,

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:16.528
"and then that gator
came back to life,

00:03:16.528 --> 00:03:18.197
"bit my hand off
like I was Captain Hook.

00:03:18.197 --> 00:03:19.932
"Jesus, I had to drive to--

00:03:19.932 --> 00:03:22.735
"I had to drive to the hospital
with no hand, drinkin' beers,

00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:24.704
"and the sheriff done
pulled me over on a boat.

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:26.305
"He pulled me over
on a damn boat.

00:03:26.305 --> 00:03:28.308
"I said, 'Sheriff, how you got
that boat on land?'

00:03:28.308 --> 00:03:30.609
"He said, 'I didn't. You got
your truck in the water.'

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:33.479
[scoffs]
<i> Laissez les bon temps rouler."</i>

00:03:37.116 --> 00:03:38.618
[chuckles]

00:03:40.252 --> 00:03:42.155
I'm disappointed too.

00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:45.557
I wish I spoke like that.

00:03:45.557 --> 00:03:47.126
Truthfully, a true
New Orleans accent

00:03:47.126 --> 00:03:50.262
just sounds like--
take a fuckin' East Coast guy,

00:03:50.262 --> 00:03:51.964
"Why you askin' where I'm from?

00:03:51.964 --> 00:03:53.967
Why is it your business?
I'm from Hoboken."

00:03:53.967 --> 00:03:55.300
Take that guy,

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.971
give him a Valium.

00:03:58.971 --> 00:04:01.975
"Now you got
a New Orleans accent.

00:04:01.975 --> 00:04:07.012
"I don't remember
where I'm from.

00:04:07.012 --> 00:04:09.649
"What's a Hoboken?

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:12.751
You can fish on it?"

00:04:12.751 --> 00:04:14.921
All right, back to the story.

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:18.491
So the previous tenant
left behind a gift for us.

00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:19.859
It wasn't Tony Chachere's.

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.461
I just like talking
about that stuff.

00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:24.130
It's delicious.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.197
But it was a spice.

00:04:25.197 --> 00:04:28.867
He left behind
a jar of cumin.

00:04:28.867 --> 00:04:30.302
Right, cumin.
You know it.

00:04:30.302 --> 00:04:32.205
It's very com--
if--if you ever had a curry

00:04:32.205 --> 00:04:34.474
or a chili--it's--
if you--if you've tasted chili,

00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:36.108
you've tasted cumin.

00:04:36.108 --> 00:04:38.210
And here's a little secret:
if you--if you're broke,

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.013
and you got a hot dog,
but you can't afford a chili,

00:04:41.013 --> 00:04:44.117
just sprinkle some cumin
on that hot dog.

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:46.218
It'll make it taste
exactly like

00:04:46.218 --> 00:04:49.121
you rolled it in dirt.

00:04:49.121 --> 00:04:53.660
It's not a good
stand-alone spice at all.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.661
It really isn't.

00:04:55.661 --> 00:04:58.563
That's probably why
he left it behind.

00:04:58.563 --> 00:05:00.466
But upon discovering that jar,

00:05:00.466 --> 00:05:02.034
I said to my new roommate,

00:05:02.034 --> 00:05:05.204
"Hey, look at this big-ass jar
of 'come-in.'"

00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:10.342
It's spelled c-u-m-i-n,

00:05:10.342 --> 00:05:11.677
and I know how it's pronounced,

00:05:11.677 --> 00:05:13.045
but first of all,
'come-in.'

00:05:13.045 --> 00:05:15.581
It's, like, an ejaculation joke,

00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:17.015
and I was in my early 20s,

00:05:17.015 --> 00:05:21.521
when ejaculation jokes
were very funny.

00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:23.089
Now, in my 30s,

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:25.257
ejaculation jokes
are extremely funny.

00:05:25.257 --> 00:05:28.728
They've gotten funnier.

00:05:28.728 --> 00:05:30.696
But also,
one of my favorite gags

00:05:30.696 --> 00:05:33.165
is to purposefully
mispronounce things,

00:05:33.165 --> 00:05:38.004
because I love rousing
the grammar dragons.

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:38.938
[growling]

00:05:38.938 --> 00:05:41.874
Gnash your teeth,
grammar dragon.

00:05:44.043 --> 00:05:45.878
"Hey, look at this
big-ass jar of 'come-in.'"

00:05:45.878 --> 00:05:48.681
I expected him to,
you know, worst-case,

00:05:48.681 --> 00:05:50.717
be like, "Shut up.
It's pronounced cumin."

00:05:50.717 --> 00:05:52.051
Or who knows?

00:05:52.051 --> 00:05:54.419
Best case, now we got
a new inside joke

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:56.088
between roommates

00:05:56.088 --> 00:05:58.090
that we can have
for the next six months

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.625
unless we extend our lease
to a year.

00:05:59.625 --> 00:06:01.594
You know how it goes.

00:06:01.594 --> 00:06:03.095
So I said it.

00:06:03.095 --> 00:06:05.231
"Hey, look at this big-ass jar
of 'come-in,'"

00:06:05.231 --> 00:06:07.032
and he goes, "What?

00:06:07.032 --> 00:06:08.434
"What?

00:06:08.434 --> 00:06:11.103
"It's cumin!

00:06:11.103 --> 00:06:12.538
"God damn it.
It's cumin.

00:06:12.538 --> 00:06:16.875
Don't say that shit."

00:06:16.875 --> 00:06:20.245
Exactly.

00:06:20.245 --> 00:06:22.948
I was like, "Oh."

00:06:22.948 --> 00:06:26.285
Whom did I just move in with?

00:06:29.054 --> 00:06:30.990
And now, I was obsessed
with that moment,

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.924
and before I knew it,
it was lunchtime,

00:06:32.924 --> 00:06:35.394
and he ordered a Hawaiian pizza,

00:06:35.394 --> 00:06:36.596
and I was like, "Oh.

00:06:36.596 --> 00:06:38.064
"Hawaiian pizza.

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:39.432
"You know what's delicious

00:06:39.432 --> 00:06:42.135
"when you put it
on Hawaiian pizza?

00:06:42.135 --> 00:06:43.936
Some 'come-in.'"

00:06:43.936 --> 00:06:45.471
And right away,
like clockwork,

00:06:45.471 --> 00:06:49.141
"Seriously? Don't fucking
say that to me again.

00:06:49.141 --> 00:06:50.442
"It's cumin.

00:06:50.442 --> 00:06:54.814
You say it right,
or you don't say it."

00:06:54.814 --> 00:06:57.950
And then, "Grow up."

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.518
And I was like,
"Well, now I'm never

00:06:59.518 --> 00:07:01.787
going to grow up, am I?"

00:07:01.787 --> 00:07:03.322
You just Peter Pan-ed me.

00:07:03.322 --> 00:07:07.827
I am a boy for life.

00:07:07.827 --> 00:07:10.696
Later--later that day,
his girlfriend comes over.

00:07:10.696 --> 00:07:12.164
It's, like, evening time.

00:07:12.164 --> 00:07:14.933
The--it's her first time
in the new apartment.

00:07:14.933 --> 00:07:16.636
They're sharing a pint
of ice cream,

00:07:16.636 --> 00:07:18.837
and I didn't even--
I didn't even say anything.

00:07:18.837 --> 00:07:22.875
I just leaned
out of the kitchen...

00:07:22.875 --> 00:07:25.978
Showed him the jar...

00:07:31.183 --> 00:07:33.285
And right there,
next to his girl, he's all--

00:07:33.285 --> 00:07:34.520
[giggling]

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:39.058
"Fuck you."

00:07:39.058 --> 00:07:41.327
And she's, of course,
like, "Huh? What?"

00:07:41.327 --> 00:07:43.061
And he explained it.

00:07:43.061 --> 00:07:46.899
"He thinks it's funny
to pronounce cumin 'come-in.'"

00:07:49.067 --> 00:07:52.071
And then she starts laughing.

00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:55.174
Because she has
a sense of humor.

00:07:55.174 --> 00:07:57.709
And then he turns on her,
like, "God damn it.

00:07:57.709 --> 00:07:58.877
"That's not funny!

00:07:58.877 --> 00:07:59.978
It's cumin!"

00:07:59.978 --> 00:08:01.046
And he's yelling,

00:08:01.046 --> 00:08:02.681
and I didn't see much of her

00:08:02.681 --> 00:08:04.249
after that.

00:08:04.249 --> 00:08:06.719
And I had to leave,
because their fight

00:08:06.719 --> 00:08:09.021
got pretty loud
and pretty awkward.

00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:10.555
And I went out drinking
with friends,

00:08:10.555 --> 00:08:12.992
and we're--I'm like,
"You got to see this.

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:17.396
You got to see this shit."

00:08:17.396 --> 00:08:19.231
And I bring them back
to the apartment.

00:08:19.231 --> 00:08:21.200
It's, like, 3:30 in the morning.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.936
I'm like, "Welcome
to the new digs, fellas.

00:08:23.936 --> 00:08:25.338
"Can I offer you...

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:29.075
some Ritz Crackers
and 'come-in'?"

00:08:30.576 --> 00:08:32.744
And like clockwork,
he comes out of his room.

00:08:32.744 --> 00:08:34.246
"Hey!
What the fuck?

00:08:34.246 --> 00:08:37.249
"It's cumin.

00:08:37.249 --> 00:08:41.420
Say it.
Say it."

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:43.789
And we're all laughing
our ass off, and he's like,

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:46.392
"I fucking hope
you all die one day."

00:08:48.794 --> 00:08:50.729
Well, we will.

00:08:50.729 --> 00:08:52.765
Nice one.

00:08:52.765 --> 00:08:56.569
Nice one, man.

00:08:56.569 --> 00:08:57.970
And all he had to do

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:01.573
was just not react
just once,

00:09:01.573 --> 00:09:02.875
and I'd have forgotten about it,

00:09:02.875 --> 00:09:04.810
but now I had no choice.

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:07.245
I was having dreams

00:09:07.245 --> 00:09:09.815
about how I was gonna
mess with him.

00:09:09.815 --> 00:09:11.450
And so the next morning,
we're both up early.

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:13.452
Our new--our first day
in the new apartment,

00:09:13.452 --> 00:09:15.054
first morning, okay?

00:09:15.054 --> 00:09:16.822
He's up early,
'cause he was still in class--

00:09:16.822 --> 00:09:18.090
in school--he had
to go to class.

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:19.391
I'm up early to go to work,

00:09:19.391 --> 00:09:21.293
and he's sitting down
to a fresh plate

00:09:21.293 --> 00:09:22.961
of scrambled eggs,

00:09:22.961 --> 00:09:26.432
and I was like, "Hey."

00:09:30.636 --> 00:09:31.971
"You know
what would be delicious

00:09:31.971 --> 00:09:34.740
on those scrambled eggs?"

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:36.141
And he gives me a look

00:09:36.141 --> 00:09:40.112
that I can only describe
as murder fuck.

00:09:41.747 --> 00:09:44.082
It's a look you give someone

00:09:44.082 --> 00:09:45.484
when you want to murder them

00:09:45.484 --> 00:09:47.453
and then sexually violate
their dead body

00:09:47.453 --> 00:09:50.856
so their soul
can't go to heaven.

00:09:50.856 --> 00:09:51.924
Murder fuck.

00:09:51.924 --> 00:09:53.659
It looks like...
[growling]

00:09:53.659 --> 00:09:56.662
So he gives me that look.

00:09:56.662 --> 00:09:58.763
[growling]

00:09:58.763 --> 00:10:01.367
So I know I can't say "come-in."

00:10:01.367 --> 00:10:03.803
Got to throw
a knuckleball at him,

00:10:03.803 --> 00:10:06.672
so I said,
"Some Tony Chachere's.

00:10:06.672 --> 00:10:08.774
I bought some last night.
It's in the kitchen."

00:10:08.774 --> 00:10:10.509
And then, he went from, like...
[growling]

00:10:10.509 --> 00:10:11.977
To "Ah."

00:10:11.977 --> 00:10:14.012
Smiling, because that's what
a Tony Chachere

00:10:14.012 --> 00:10:15.180
make you do, baby.

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:16.948
It's so delicious.
[laughs]

00:10:16.948 --> 00:10:18.484
You put it on a crazy person,

00:10:18.484 --> 00:10:19.484
turn him into a friend.

00:10:19.484 --> 00:10:20.686
[laughs]

00:10:20.686 --> 00:10:22.855
<i> Enchanté.</i>

00:10:27.459 --> 00:10:30.562
And now, he is in the kitchen,
digging around,

00:10:30.562 --> 00:10:32.831
and I hear him opening
and closing all the cabinets.

00:10:32.831 --> 00:10:34.533
He's like, "Where is it?"

00:10:34.533 --> 00:10:37.302
"Oh, it's--uh, it's in the--
it's in the cabinet."

00:10:37.302 --> 00:10:38.403
"Which one?"

00:10:38.403 --> 00:10:41.073
"The one above
the George Foreman grill."

00:10:41.073 --> 00:10:42.875
"Where?
I can't find it."

00:10:42.875 --> 00:10:45.310
"It's in the top part.

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:46.578
There."

00:10:46.578 --> 00:10:49.382
"Where?"

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:54.553
"Behind the 'come-in.'"

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.029
And what normally followed
that word,

00:11:04.029 --> 00:11:05.063
as I established,

00:11:05.063 --> 00:11:06.665
was a fit of rage.

00:11:06.665 --> 00:11:08.566
Only this time,
that's not what happened.

00:11:08.566 --> 00:11:10.736
This time, it was total silence,

00:11:10.736 --> 00:11:14.373
which was scary.

00:11:14.373 --> 00:11:15.774
'Cause after a while,
I was like,

00:11:15.774 --> 00:11:17.575
"Oh, God, am I gonna
walk in there

00:11:17.575 --> 00:11:19.745
"and find him just on the ground

00:11:19.745 --> 00:11:22.047
"with his wrists slit?

00:11:22.047 --> 00:11:23.615
Bleeding it out."

00:11:23.615 --> 00:11:25.750
Like, "You went too far.

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:26.952
"You went too far.

00:11:26.952 --> 00:11:28.186
"It's pronounced cumin,

00:11:28.186 --> 00:11:29.855
and now you'll never forget."

00:11:29.855 --> 00:11:32.958
[groaning]

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:38.797
"Oh, Lord, I'm come..."

00:11:38.797 --> 00:11:41.934
[applause]

00:11:49.541 --> 00:11:52.110
Thankfully, no,
that's not what happened.

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:54.947
Instead, he comes out,
holding the jar,

00:11:54.947 --> 00:11:57.116
staring me down

00:11:57.116 --> 00:11:59.785
with the hatred
of a thousand men,

00:11:59.785 --> 00:12:02.221
and then throws it at me,

00:12:02.221 --> 00:12:04.790
'cause he just didn't--
it--it was--it was like

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:06.157
he just released too early,

00:12:06.157 --> 00:12:08.627
and it bounced off the wall
and just landed,

00:12:08.627 --> 00:12:11.463
like, right there
between us on the carpet,

00:12:11.463 --> 00:12:14.599
and I look up at him,
and he's now crying.

00:12:14.599 --> 00:12:15.968
Hatred.
Hatred tears.

00:12:15.968 --> 00:12:17.436
You can tell
when they're hatred tears,

00:12:17.436 --> 00:12:19.104
'cause they're boiling
with rage,

00:12:19.104 --> 00:12:22.274
and they evaporate mid-cheek.

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:26.946
And he says,
"I'm--I'm going to class,

00:12:26.946 --> 00:12:28.180
and then I'm fucking
moving out,"

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:29.247
and he storms off.

00:12:29.247 --> 00:12:32.785
Now, I had just been attacked

00:12:32.785 --> 00:12:35.320
for no reason.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.256
First order of business
in that moment

00:12:38.256 --> 00:12:41.160
was to eat those scrambled eggs.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.528
They were fresh,
and I was hungry,

00:12:42.528 --> 00:12:43.995
and I doused 'em
with that Tony's.

00:12:43.995 --> 00:12:45.330
It was right there
by the microwave.

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:50.102
I'm surprised he didn't find it.

00:12:50.102 --> 00:12:51.270
Second order of business,

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:52.871
call into work sick.

00:12:52.871 --> 00:12:54.639
I couldn't bus tables.

00:12:54.639 --> 00:12:56.308
I was traumatized.

00:12:56.308 --> 00:12:59.512
I couldn't handle silverware
in that mental state.

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:03.314
Third order of business,

00:13:03.314 --> 00:13:05.183
a little well-deserved R and R.

00:13:05.183 --> 00:13:06.285
Plop down on the couch--

00:13:06.285 --> 00:13:07.852
his couch, mind you.

00:13:07.852 --> 00:13:09.020
Turn the TV on--
his TV.

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:10.355
Didn't know if any of that stuff

00:13:10.355 --> 00:13:12.858
was gonna be there
by the end of the day.

00:13:12.858 --> 00:13:14.125
I'm watching TV--oh, look,

00:13:14.125 --> 00:13:15.627
a "Saved by the Bell" marathon.

00:13:15.627 --> 00:13:16.962
Oh, wow, season three,

00:13:16.962 --> 00:13:19.298
while they're at the Malibu
Sands Beach Resort.

00:13:19.298 --> 00:13:20.899
Oh, they're in bikinis.

00:13:20.899 --> 00:13:25.737
Well, I've earned this.

00:13:25.737 --> 00:13:28.039
A little release.

00:13:28.039 --> 00:13:30.509
And there I am,
furiously masturbating

00:13:30.509 --> 00:13:33.044
on his couch,
watching his TV,

00:13:33.044 --> 00:13:35.547
and right as I near climax,

00:13:35.547 --> 00:13:37.048
that jar catches my eye.

00:13:37.048 --> 00:13:38.516
It's still laying there
on the ground,

00:13:38.516 --> 00:13:41.186
and now--I--
that's why I was in this moment,

00:13:41.186 --> 00:13:42.588
so it was like a lover to me,

00:13:42.588 --> 00:13:45.190
and I exclaimed,
"Oh, 'come-in,'"

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:46.992
right as I began...
[chuckles]

00:13:46.992 --> 00:13:48.026
Comin'.

00:13:48.026 --> 00:13:49.427
And I shouted it,

00:13:49.427 --> 00:13:52.398
so the furniture would know
what was going on.

00:13:55.267 --> 00:13:57.269
And then the front door
swung open,

00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:59.538
and there's a UPS delivery guy
standing there...

00:14:05.043 --> 00:14:07.078
Holding a package.

00:14:07.078 --> 00:14:09.247
Sees me holding my package,

00:14:09.247 --> 00:14:10.849
and says, "Oh, fuck no,"

00:14:10.849 --> 00:14:14.185
and slams that door.

00:14:14.185 --> 00:14:15.186
Couple of things.

00:14:15.186 --> 00:14:16.755
Yes, he caught me masturbating.

00:14:16.755 --> 00:14:17.957
Fine.

00:14:17.957 --> 00:14:20.192
But he scared me,
frightened me,

00:14:20.192 --> 00:14:23.228
and it happened right
as I began orgasming.

00:14:23.228 --> 00:14:25.430
Have you ever been frightened

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:29.901
right as you begin to come?

00:14:29.901 --> 00:14:32.938
Oh, man, is it great.

00:14:32.938 --> 00:14:34.740
Oh, man,

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:36.975
is it so badass.

00:14:36.975 --> 00:14:38.277
Just--oh,

00:14:38.277 --> 00:14:41.246
it's so much semen.

00:14:41.246 --> 00:14:45.284
Spew forth from my loins.

00:14:45.284 --> 00:14:46.451
I don't know what happens.

00:14:46.451 --> 00:14:48.753
Maybe your brain senses danger,

00:14:48.753 --> 00:14:51.890
and orders a mandatory
full evacuation

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:53.892
of your testicles.

00:14:53.892 --> 00:14:55.794
Run, evacuate, go.

00:14:55.794 --> 00:14:59.732
Save the seed.
The mother ship is in danger.

00:15:03.301 --> 00:15:06.404
There was so much.

00:15:06.404 --> 00:15:08.340
And then I just had to sit
there quietly, like,

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:11.910
"Is he still--
is he still there?

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:13.812
Oh, God."

00:15:13.812 --> 00:15:15.980
And I finally went
and looked out of the peephole,

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:17.916
and yep, he's standing there,

00:15:17.916 --> 00:15:19.450
sort of swaying,

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:20.986
and I was like, "God damn it."

00:15:20.986 --> 00:15:22.654
So I lit a cigarette.

00:15:22.654 --> 00:15:25.090
Thought it would make me look
more badass--lit a cigarette.

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:26.992
I'm like, "Okay, let's do it,"
and I open the door,

00:15:26.992 --> 00:15:28.426
and right away, he's like,

00:15:28.426 --> 00:15:30.929
"Listen, I'm not into
no goddamn gay shit.

00:15:30.929 --> 00:15:32.464
"I got a wife;
I got a family,

00:15:32.464 --> 00:15:36.635
and you're too young."

00:15:36.635 --> 00:15:40.272
I know, right?
Why--why--what's that for?

00:15:40.272 --> 00:15:41.473
But now, I'm defensive.

00:15:41.473 --> 00:15:43.308
Puffing on my cigarette,
like, "Hey, man.

00:15:43.308 --> 00:15:44.876
"It's a fucking
private apartment.

00:15:44.876 --> 00:15:46.111
"Why don't you try knocking?

00:15:46.111 --> 00:15:47.646
You ever heard of knocking?"

00:15:47.646 --> 00:15:50.448
And then he doesn't say
anything, and angrily goes,

00:15:50.448 --> 00:15:54.687
"I didn't knock,
because you said 'Come in.'"

00:16:00.525 --> 00:16:02.227
"Because you said,
'Come in.'"

00:16:02.227 --> 00:16:05.364
[cheers and applause]

00:16:09.701 --> 00:16:13.572
That's the kind of coincidence
that made man invent God.

00:16:15.373 --> 00:16:16.708
If I were a religious person,

00:16:16.708 --> 00:16:18.543
that would have been
my mind-set--like, well,

00:16:18.543 --> 00:16:22.214
the Lord clearly does not want
me touching myself.

00:16:22.214 --> 00:16:24.883
Thus why he sent
this brave soldier

00:16:24.883 --> 00:16:29.588
to interrupt me whilst doing
the devil's diddle.

00:16:29.588 --> 00:16:31.556
Like, I couldn't stop--
like, in that moment,

00:16:31.556 --> 00:16:33.325
like, he was about to knock.

00:16:33.325 --> 00:16:34.726
I didn't say "Come in."

00:16:34.726 --> 00:16:37.395
I was--I was--
having sex with a spice.

00:16:37.395 --> 00:16:38.897
I said, "Oh, comin',"

00:16:38.897 --> 00:16:40.999
which sounds exactly
like "Oh, come in."

00:16:40.999 --> 00:16:44.269
Gee--all I could think about
in that moment was my roommate.

00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:45.571
Like, he's right.

00:16:45.571 --> 00:16:48.707
I should have pronounced it
correctly.

00:16:48.707 --> 00:16:51.276
If I'd have been like,
"Oh, cumin."

00:16:51.276 --> 00:16:53.511
He'd have heard that and been
like, "What'd he say?

00:16:53.511 --> 00:16:57.849
Oh, cu--
I should knock."

00:16:57.849 --> 00:16:59.684
And I would later find out,
by the way,

00:16:59.684 --> 00:17:01.453
the reason my roommate
got so pissed

00:17:01.453 --> 00:17:04.956
is because his--his childhood
pet was a cocker spaniel

00:17:04.956 --> 00:17:07.058
named Cumin.

00:17:07.058 --> 00:17:08.193
And so when I said, "come-in,"

00:17:08.193 --> 00:17:09.628
it reminded him of Cumin,

00:17:09.628 --> 00:17:11.596
and he got sad
that I was mispronouncing it.

00:17:11.596 --> 00:17:14.265
Fuck you.

00:17:14.265 --> 00:17:17.702
And then this UPS guy, he slams
this clipboard in my chest.

00:17:17.702 --> 00:17:19.037
He's like, "You have
to sign for it,"

00:17:19.037 --> 00:17:20.539
and now, I'm just backpedaling.

00:17:20.539 --> 00:17:22.274
I'm like, "Look, I thought
you were my girlfriend,"

00:17:22.274 --> 00:17:23.608
and he interrupts me;
he's like,

00:17:23.608 --> 00:17:26.244
"You ain't got no damn
girlfriend."

00:17:26.244 --> 00:17:29.782
"You're right.
I do not."

00:17:29.782 --> 00:17:31.450
And then he gives me
the package,

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:33.251
says "Have a nice day,"
and then finally I looked--

00:17:33.251 --> 00:17:35.620
finally looked at the package.
It wasn't addressed to me.

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.122
It was not addressed
to my roommate.

00:17:37.122 --> 00:17:39.791
It was addressed to who I assume
was the previous tenant,

00:17:39.791 --> 00:17:43.662
so that meant
it was addressed to me now.

00:17:43.662 --> 00:17:45.063
And I open it

00:17:45.063 --> 00:17:47.432
and almost collapse

00:17:47.432 --> 00:17:48.901
at what I see before me.

00:17:48.901 --> 00:17:50.769
Can you guess?

00:17:50.769 --> 00:17:51.570
- Cumin.
- No.

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:55.474
It was a spice rack.

00:17:55.474 --> 00:17:58.443
If the previous moment
made me believe in God,

00:17:58.443 --> 00:18:00.512
that made me believe that God

00:18:00.512 --> 00:18:04.116
is capable of bragging.

00:18:04.116 --> 00:18:05.283
Thank you guys very much.

00:18:05.283 --> 00:18:06.418
[cheers and applause]
