<i>We went to Mexico to look at the
sacred Cenotes in the Yucatan.</i>

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.605
<i>They used to be spiritual
 places for the Mayans</i>

00:00:05.605 --> 00:00:09.175
<i>today we come and we seek peace
and relaxation and meditation.</i>

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:12.845

community on Epiphany day.</i>

00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:16.116 line:0%

00:00:20.252 --> 00:00:22.921
We went to India for the
Ganga Dussehra ceremony.

00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:26.092
One-point-three million people

00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:28.728
making offerings in
the sacred Ganges.

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:31.030
( sound of the river flowing )

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.665
<i> It's a staggering event.</i>

00:00:32.998 --> 00:00:36.235
<i>Again, where they light candles,
 say prayers, beautiful.</i>

00:00:36.235 --> 00:00:39.605
<i>If you ever get the chance
to go to Haridwar, do go.</i>

00:00:39.605 --> 00:00:42.275
<i>And then wait just for dusk, and</i>

00:00:42.275 --> 00:00:45.778
<i>it becomes the most beautiful,
 poetic scene of humanity</i>

00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:47.847
in deep spiritual prayer

00:00:47.847 --> 00:00:49.882
with the candles
moving down the river.

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:51.884
<i> We went to look at the
 commercialization</i>

00:00:51.884 --> 00:00:54.520
<i> of the spirituality of
 the Ganges, to Mumbai</i>

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.455
<i> to Bombay where a
 giant water park</i>

00:00:56.455 --> 00:00:58.625
<i> with the symbol of
 the Ganga is there</i>

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:00.293
<i> and you can slide
 down the Ganga.</i>

00:01:00.527 --> 00:01:03.163
<i>We went to Turkey to look
at sacred water in Islam.</i>

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:06.098
<i> Ablutions before going
 into the mosque to pray.</i>

00:01:06.098 --> 00:01:08.935
<i> The Greek Orthodox
 Church in Istanbul.</i>

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:10.103
<i> We know about baptisms</i>

00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:12.004
<i> but let's do it in a
 little more poetic way.</i>

00:01:12.004 --> 00:01:13.339
<i> We don't have to see
 all the nudity.</i>

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:17.910
<i>Went to Bali, to look at the
 spirituality in Hinduism</i>

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.781
<i>where they pray where the water
is considered extremely sacred.</i>

00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:25.819
<i>Japan, at a meditation center,
where people pray under dripping</i>

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:28.855
<i>and meditate under dripping
 droplets of water.</i>

00:01:28.855 --> 00:01:32.325
<i>The taoist outside of Kyoto
line up under candlelight</i>

00:01:32.325 --> 00:01:36.796
<i>and pray for blessings under
cascading cold waterfalls.</i>

00:01:37.463 --> 00:01:40.700
<i> And if you're gonna work
 in an onsen, in Japan</i>

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.502
<i>and everybody is naked, you
 kinda feel kinda funny</i>

00:01:43.502 --> 00:01:45.304
<i>you're wearing your clothes and
 everybody else is naked.</i>

00:01:45.304 --> 00:01:47.273
<i>So, it's probably the only
assignment I've ever done</i>

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:49.976
<i> where I worked naked
 for three days.</i>

00:01:49.976 --> 00:01:51.043
( audience laughter )

00:01:51.043 --> 00:01:52.311
<i> I just worked naked.</i>

00:01:52.311 --> 00:01:54.546
<i> South of France
in a cave that is believed</i>

00:01:54.546 --> 00:01:56.916
<i>that the Virgin Mary appeared.</i>

00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:59.618
<i> Every day
 thousands come to touch</i>

00:01:59.618 --> 00:02:01.387
<i>the water seeping from the wall.</i>

00:02:01.387 --> 00:02:05.091
So desperate are some in pain,
they come in their hospital beds

00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:08.261
praying for relief,
to touch that sacred water.
