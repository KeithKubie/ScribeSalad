00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.760 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Levon Avdoyan: It's inconceivable
to me that we gather here today,

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.880
diplomats, congressional staffers,
colleagues, friends, family,

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.400
not only for the 20th annual
Vardanants Day Armenia lecture,

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.250
but also for the 25th anniversary
of the Republic of Armenia.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.920
And of the Dadian Grant,

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.890
which reinvigorated the
Armenian collections and programs

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.840
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.040
None of this has been
achieved by a single person.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.370
We are a library.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.400
We collaborate.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.970
The special evens office,
the communications office,

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.660
and my colleagues both
here and in cataloging

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.100
and acquisitions divisions,
have been here from the start.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.610
I would like to begin, however,
with a person for the last decade

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.520
who has been a great supporter

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.140
of the Armenian programs
and initiatives.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.730
She believes not only
collecting and servicing all

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.840 position:56%
of our country's resources, but also
in presenting them to the public

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.380
with events such as
this lecture series.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.080 position:56%
Please join me in welcoming Dr. Mary
Jane-Deeb, the chief of the African

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.740
and Middle Eastern Division.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.100
[ Applause ]

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.790
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
Okay, well thank you

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.500
and thank you all for being here.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.700
On behalf of everyone in the
African Middle East Division,

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.270
I would like to welcome you to
this library and to this wonderful,

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.370
beautiful hole that we call
the Northeast Pavilion.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.030
I'm delighted to see you all
here on this special occasion

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.220
when we celebrate, as Dr.
Avdoyan has just mentioned,

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.430
the 20th annual Vardanants Day
lecture, one of the longest series

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.750
of lectures of its
kind a the library.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.810 position:56%
With a presentation by Professor
Christina Maranci, the Arthur Dadian

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.670
and Ara Oztemel professor
of Armenian art

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.630
and architecture history
at Tufts University.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:30.420 position:56%
It is only because of the hard work
and dedication of Dr. Levon Avdoyan,

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.820
the Armenian-Georgia
specialist in this division,

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.630
and the generous financial
support of the Arthur

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.320 position:56%
and Marjorie Dadian fund that this
unique lecture series at the Library

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:47.140
of Congress was made possible
and thrive for two decades.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.940
I would also like to join
Dr. Avdoyan in thanking you

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.030
for your presence here today, and
especially to you who have traveled

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.980
from many parts of the
United States to be with us.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.650
And thank you Ambassador
Hovhannissian

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.100
for having taking the time
off your busy schedule

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.400
to join us for today's event.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.140
Before we start, let me tell you
something about our division.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.440
I always do this.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.580
This is our special commercial.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.820
But, so although Armenian
films, photographs music,

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:28.310
maps and other items can be found
throughout this vast library,

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.440
we hold most of the materials
in the Armenian language.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.910
We keep and preserve rare
manuscripts written and illustrated

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.280
by Armenian scholars and artists.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.080
We serve our readers books,
newspapers and periodicals

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.630
that are published in Armenia,
as well as in the diaspora.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.100
And Dr. Avdoyan briefs
scholars, politicians,

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.950
as he did when the president
of Armenia was here a year ago,

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.930 position:56%
as well as school children and
visitors from other parts of America

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:06.330
and other parts of the world
about the Armenian collections.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.560 position:56%
And now lest you think that we are
the Armenian division of the Library

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.390
of Congress, we do this as
well for other countries

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.160
for which we are responsible
in the Middle East in Africa,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.670
in Central Asia and the Caucuses.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.330
And now here to welcome you

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.640
to the library is a
deputy librarian David Mao.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.110
David served as acting librarian
of Congress until last week

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.740
when a new librarian of Congress
Dr. Carla Hayden was sworn

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.630
and took office, was sworn in.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.610
He's a graduate of the
George Washington University

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.540
and the Georgetown University
Law Center and is admitted

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.980
to the District of Columbia Bar.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.780
He received a graduate
degree in library science

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.210
from the Catholic University of
America and has practiced law

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.670
for several years, including at the
prestigious international law firm

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:08.310 position:56%
of Covington and Burling and has
had various positions at the Library

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.840 position:56%
of Congress, including being the law
librarian and the acting librarian

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:21.230
of Congress in the position in
which he has acted incredibly,

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.150
superlatively well.

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.550
Reorganizing many parts of the
library within a very short time.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.530
So let me now call upon
him to address you.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.010
So David Mao.

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.580
[ Applause ]

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:36.880
&gt;&gt; David Mao: Good
afternoon everyone.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.080
Thank you very much Mary-Jane
for that very kind introduction.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.350
And Mr. Ambassador
we're greatly honored

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.060
that you're able to
join us here today.

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.870
As you heard, my name is David Mao,

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.230
and I am the deputy
librarian of congress.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.330
We do have a new 14th
librarian of congress here,

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:56.180
only the 14th in our 216 years of
history at the Library of Congress.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.480
We're very excited.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.930
We had a wonderful swearing
in ceremony last week.

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.890
Dr. Hayden could not join us
here today, but I do extend

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:08.480
on her behalf a great welcome
to all of you, Mr. Ambassador,

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.260
to all of our friends for being
here in this wonderful pavilion

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.980
and really to this wonderful
event, the 20th anniversary,

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:20.870
the 20th Vardanants Day
lecture here at the library.

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:25.700
As you have heard from Lee,
Armenian collections and programs,

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.260
that's not new here at the library.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.800
We've been doing it
for quite some time

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.740
through the generous support
of many, many friends.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.830
And the Vardanants Day lecture,

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.720
this is the 20th lecture
here at the library.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.920
And since 1994 when the first
lecture was held, scholars,

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.170
members of congress, members of
the diplomatic core, musicians

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:53.980 position:56%
and even scientists have spoken all
about Armenia, to celebrate Armenia.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.350
And we're just extremely delighted

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:58.710
that we can continue
this tradition here.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.700
As you can see, we are
filming this lecture.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.780
All of our previous lectures are
available on the library's website,

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.760
and they're quite popular.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.650
I'm told that the 17th Vardanants
Day lecture on DNA and the origins

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:15.560
of the Armenian people has
generated over 62,000 viewings

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.990
on our website, which is fantastic.

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.050
I suspect that our
lecture today is going

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.680
to generate many more than that.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.190
I myself had the privilege of
visiting Armenia in April of 2012,

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:33.480
and as I think back,
visiting the [inaudible],

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.330
seeing the Geghard Monestary and
getting to meet the Catholicos

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:38.630
when I was at Etchmiadzin.

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:42.850
It was just incredible experiences
which is why I'm extremely honored

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:46.930
to be able to welcome all of you to
this program on such a special day

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:51.000
on this the 25th anniversary
of the Republic

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.130
of Armenia's Declaration
of Independence.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:58.710
If you have not been to Armenia,
I really recommend that you go.

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:00.240
It was just an incredible
experience,

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.000 position:56%
and I hopefully have the opportunity

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.850
to go once more sometime
in the future.

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:08.510
So again, welcome to the
library and enjoy the program.

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:11.040
[ Applause ]

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.120
&gt;&gt; Levon Avdoyan: Thank
you Mr. Mao, David.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:19.390
I wanted to mention also that
David represented the Library

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:21.690
of Congress in Yerevan in 2012.

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:25.940 position:56%
And ever since, I at least have
considered him an honorary Armenian.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:28.250
And Mr. Ambassador, I think
you could probably confer

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:29.940
that honor on him.

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:34.470
Good. Twenty-five years
ago on this very day,

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:38.570
Armenia proclaimed its
independence from the Soviet Union.

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:42.620
Since that time, a series
of diplomats, both American

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:46.110
and Armenian, has sought
to create relationships

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:49.190
that did not previously exist.

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:51.070
Armenia has been well-served

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:54.120
by the ambassadors it
has sent to this post.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.930
And particularly well-served by
his Excellency Grigor Hovhannissian

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:00.930
who reported in January
of this year.

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.820
Ambassador Hovhannissian
has served in a variety

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:07.130
of posts throughout the world,
both for the Republic of Armenia

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:11.330
and for the United Nations with
an extensive educational resume

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:15.150
that includes the Haigazian
University of Beirut

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:19.800
and the Fletcher School at Tufts.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.710
I hope Ambassador Hovhannissian
will accept,

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:25.940
both as the Armenian specialist

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:31.330
and as a second generation
American-Armenian,

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:34.520
my sincere congratulations
to the Republic

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:37.560
on achieving this milestone.

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.560
And I am delighted that
Ambassador Hovhannissian has agreed

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.880
to say a few words on his
wonderful anniversary.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.340
Mr. Ambassador.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.490
[ Applause ]

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:51.100
&gt;&gt; Grigor Hovhannissian: Thank you
Mr. Avdoyan, Mr. Mao, Miss Deeb,

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.610
dear friends, colleagues.

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:58.140
I can't think of a better way

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.940
of celebrating Armenia's
independence than in this center.

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:05.760
One of the most important
centers in the world of knowledge,

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.460
of preserving the knowledge,
legacy of so many civilizations,

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:13.120
heritage that is so dear to
us, and also disseminating it.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.390
So I'm very, very happy that
I have this opportunity,

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:19.260
and I couldn't have
obviously missed it.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.090
Armenia is 25 years old.

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:23.420
I represented the generation
of independence.

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:28.400
I'm one of the people who went
on the streets to fight against,

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.760
to total [inaudible], to venture

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.550
into a totally unknown
territory of independence.

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:38.980
So Armenia has been
independent ever since.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:40.280
But it was not alone.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:43.730
Armenia had many friends, and
Armenia had incredible sons

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:45.520
and daughters scattered
all over the world.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.930
Some of them ended up
in the United States.

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:49.230
Some of them, and most

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:52.450
of them maintain strong bonds
with their home country.

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:57.150
And I really was blessed to
benefit and enjoy that attachment,

00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:01.150
that support, that also translated,
became a vector for our friendship

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:03.750
with our various countries,
including the United States.

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:07.690
The United States played
a tremendous role

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:12.730
in us becoming self-confident,
independent country,

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:16.760
despite formidable odds we have
been facing all these years.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:22.220
And in all sectors of public
life, in economy and in culture.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.060
The Library of Congress
is no exception.

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:29.780 position:56%
For 20 consecutive years to host
Armenian lectures, events, exhibits,

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:32.130
we're so blessed, so thankful

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:36.530
to professionals, activists,
volunteers.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:39.900 position:56%
So from the bottom of my heart an on
behalf of the government of Armenia,

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.830
I thank you, Mr. Avdoyan,
your colleagues,

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:48.350
for your relentless activities that
we're, as I said, blessed with.

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:54.060 position:56%
And as a token of our appreciation,
I want to, typically I go to places,

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:55.420
and I sit with a bottle of cognac,

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.550
which is the most known
Armenian product.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:01.230
But that would be sacrilege
in the Library of Congress.

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:04.830
I got you one of he newest
albums we have out there on,

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:06.650
it's called The Immortals.

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:10.700
It recaps two millennial
for me in history.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:13.180
It's a little naïve, but
it's a nice illustrated album

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:15.320
that I want you to
have here in congress.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.120
Thank you very much.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:25.090
[ Applause ]

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:28.440
&gt;&gt; Levon Avdoyan: I have often
said to everyone who will listen

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:31.200
to when it comes to our
Armenian collections development

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.480
at the Library of Congress,
I'm a pig.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.780
I want it all.

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:39.750
So, you can keep you cognac
today, but not tomorrow,

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:44.200
and I will delightfully accept this
book on the part of our division.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:49.010
Now before proceeding
with the program,

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:56.280 position:56%
I would like to speak briefly about
what today's 20th lecture means both

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.940
to me and to our division.

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:02.460
It is not only one of the longest
lasting series at the Library

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:06.630
of Congress, it is also a testament
to the success of the grant given

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:11.890
by Mrs. Marjory Dadian in 1991
for the quote/unquote health

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:14.330
and maintenance of the
Armenian collections.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:18.830
And I'm really pleased to see in
the audience one of the people

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:25.020
who actually brokered that donation
with the late Dr. George Atiyeh,

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:29.660 position:56%
our former section head of the near
east section, Dr. Christopher Murphy

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:32.800
who was in on the deliberations.

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.720
For particulars, I draw
your attention to the URL,

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:40.820
the internet address on the
second page of your program,

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:48.000 position:56%
which will give you access to a blog
I wrote on this event with pictures.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.240
Underneath that address is the URL

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.000
for the four corners
of the world blog.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.500
I recently established foray
into social media by the curators

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:01.840
of the four area studies divisions
of the Library of Congress.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:07.570 position:56%
And I urge you to subscribe, because
you will have excellent narratives

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:10.510
from our curators in
those four divisions

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:13.760
on all of our rich collections.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.090
Now Mrs. Dadian's gift
was given the same year

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:20.010
as Armenia's independence
was proclaimed.

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:22.970
I have since thought that both
the collections at the Library

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:27.060
of Congress and the republic
itself have grown together.

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:29.950
Certainly we have built
and maintained close ties

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:32.460
with the library and
librarians of the republic

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:36.590
and have an active partnership
with, at present, 14 of them.

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:42.210
Now in 1994 I created the Vardanant
selection to highlight all aspects

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:45.960
of Armenian life and culture by
presenting scholars, politicians,

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.800
musicians, artists and diplomats.

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:53.100
Many of the people who were keen
supporters then are no longer

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.400
with us.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:15:00.150
Dr. George Atiyeh himself,
Mrs. Dadian who died too soon.

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:05.210
His Excellency Harry Gilmore,
first US ambassador to Armenia.

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:07.700
James McCloud, Varcas [inaudible],

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:10.330
and just recently Father
[inaudible],

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:13.600
whose face I can still see
in the audience, waiting,

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:18.590
just bursting to ask a question
after the speaker was finished.

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:22.430 position:56%
Yet I see also many of the
original supporters in the audience,

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:24.610 position:56%
including my sister who comes often.

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:29.090
I suspect to escape Houston.

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:33.560
And my colleagues at the library

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:37.850
such as Dr. Paul Crego,
who I know is here.

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:41.410
And my colleagues in AMED
whose support has literally

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:46.100
and figuratively made this event,
along with the support of, I saw,

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:49.650
Dr. Reuben Adalian of the
Armenian National Institute

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:54.600 position:56%
and Aram [inaudible] of the Armenian
National Committee of America.

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:58.520
Yet the program rests
on the shoulders

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:01.700 position:56%
of the presenters through the years.

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:04.560
Since 2000, these lectures
have been webcast,

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:08.270
and many are now available both
on our homepage and on YouTube.

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:13.200 position:56%
And I'm pleased that David Mao
mentioned that the Peter Hrechdakian

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:17.180
and Hovann Simonian's
lecture on DNA and the orbs,

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:20.110
so the people have garnered more

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:22.910
than 62,000 views since
it was mounted.

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:25.500
And the number grows,
as do the numbers

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.190
of every lecture we presented.

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:33.120
All of this leads me to at
first thank you, our supporters.

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:38.220
To promise more programs in
the future of similar import.

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:43.370
And to introduce our speaker not by
her biography, which you will see

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:44.670
in the program, but rather

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:48.910
by describing how we
selected her to speak.

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:51.380
Earlier this year I was
contacted by the Journal

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:57.060
of Ecclesiastical History to see
if I would review an Armenian book.

00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:01.050
This book turned out to be titled
Vigilant Powers, Three Churches

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:05.860
of Early Medieval Armenia
written by Dr. Christina Maranci.

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:11.530
I agreed. What I found was a book
with its roots firmly implanted

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:16.400 position:56%
in traditional scholarship, detailed
research, delicate analysis,

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.710
and illustrative footnotes.

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:22.600
The much maligned footnote
is back, and I am delighted.

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:30.530
Yet this first book in English
about these churches was also set

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:35.110
within the context of the history
of the times and challenged many

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:39.330
of the historical assumptions
we have long maintained.

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:43.380
There was also a certain symmetry
in inviting Dr. Maranci to lecture

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:49.180
as she is, as Mary-Jane said, the
holder of the Arthur H. Dadian

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:53.070
at Tufts University, Arthur H.
Dadian, the husband of Marjorie

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:56.530
in whose name she had made her
generous grants to the library.

00:17:56.530 --> 00:18:00.200
I consulted, as I always
do, with Mary-Jane.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.570
Said I would like the
author to lecture.

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:06.350
She took one look at the
book and readily agreed.

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:11.260
So, at last, without
further explanation,

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:15.490
I would like to invite the Arthur
H. Dadian and Ara Oztemel professor

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:19.930
of Armenian art at Tufts
University, Dr. Christina Maranci,

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:25.810
to tell us about her A World
Monument, Zvart'nots', Armenia

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:28.370 position:56%
and the Wars of the Seventh Century.

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:30.060
Dr. Maranci.

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:32.440
[ Applause ]

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:33.920
&gt;&gt; Christina Maranci:
Thank you so much Levon

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.160
for your kind introduction.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:43.100
It is a great honor to give the
annual Vardanants Day talk I would

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:45.630
also like to thank the near
east section of the African

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:48.800
and Middle Eastern Studies
Division of the Library

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:51.110 position:56%
of Congress for sponsoring my visit.

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:54.670
And it's a particular privilege
to offer my lecture in memory

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:59.330
of Marjorie Dadian whose good
offices, as Levon mentioned,

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:03.090 position:56%
and those of her husband's, led
also to the creation of my own share

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:06.680 position:56%
of Armenian art at Tufts University.

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:11.570
In honor of his 25th anniversary
of Armenia's independence,

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:17.570
I wish to focus today on one of the
most iconic of medieval monuments,

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:20.610
the Church of Zvart'nots'.

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:26.460
The form of Zvart'nots' has
inspired, both medieval and modern.

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:32.390 position:56%
Zvart'nots' can be purchased in
miniature and watched in dance form.

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:38.420
Zvart'nots' appears on monetary
currency, and as all travelers

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:42.690
to Armenia know, Zvart'nots'
is the namesake

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:45.290
of the international
airport terminal.

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:50.090
It has also received more scholarly
attention than any other building

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:53.390
of the seventh century Caucuses.

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:57.360
So why so much attention
on Zvart'nots'?

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:00.400
One can offer several reasons.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.150
First it was a patriarchal church.

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:07.050
It was built by the Catholicos
of Armenia, Nerses the Third

00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:10.380
between circa 641 and 661.

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:15.170
Second, the Zvart'nots', even
in ruins, is a remarkable

00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:17.490
and unique looking building.

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:22.890 position:56%
For example, neither the nearby
seventh century churches of Hripsime

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:26.000
and Gayane, you see
them on the screen,

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.560
prepare one for the
unprecedented plan of Zvart'nots',

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:35.040
which combines a circle
and a tetraconch.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:40.880
Third, there is the intriguing
problem of its original elevation.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.990
Zvart'nots' collapsed in
the early 11th century,

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:48.490
and many scholars have proposed
hypothetical reconstructions

00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:53.100
of which that of Toros Toramanian,
which you see on the screen,

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:55.960
has gained particular favor.

00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:00.620
Quite aside from questions of its
plausibility, Toramanian's vision

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:06.470
of the church, with its three
successive and symmetrical tiers,

00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:09.640
has achieved the status of an icon.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:15.430 position:56%
The beauty of his graphic image and
the brilliance of its solution forms

00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:19.940 position:56%
as much a part of the mystique of
Zvart'nots' as the ruins themselves.

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:23.920
And it's no wonder that a
portrait of Toramanian appears

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:27.810
at the west entrance of the church.

00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:31.440
Zvart'nots' is one of
the three foci of my book

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:35.120
on seventh century architecture
entitled Vigilant Powers.

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:39.170
And in it, I wanted to step away
from the traditional methodologies

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:41.640
of Armenian architectural history.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:45.380
Until very recently, work
in the field has focused

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:49.960
on the physical aspect of
buildings, their structure and form

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:54.890 position:56%
on the documenting, describing and
categorizing of plans and elevations

00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:59.480 position:56%
and decorative motifs and mapping
developments from century to century

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:01.380
and monument to monument.

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:03.690
While this type of approach
is extremely valuable,

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:07.160
and I couldn't have done my more
interpretive work without it,

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:10.320
it easily gives the
impression of a sedate evolution

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:13.860
of building isolated from
the rest of the world.

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:18.770
But my study of Zvart'nots'
suggests the very opposite.

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:21.580
That Armenian architecture
of the seventh century,

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:26.070
when studied closely,
responded to and played a role

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:30.090
within the dramatic moment
in which it was created.

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:33.460
And that while scholars have
been frustrated in their attempts

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:37.430
to find a precise prototype
for Zvart'nots',

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:40.180
it finds satisfying
parallels in the realm

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:43.180
of history and geography writing.

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:47.880
And, in another iconic monument
produced only three decades

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:51.440
after Zvart'nots',
the Dome of the Rock.

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.680
First some background.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:57.870
In the 640s Armenia was divided
between the Byzantine Empire

00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:00.800
and the Sasanians,
but was de facto ruled

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:03.860 position:56%
by local Armenian princely families.

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:08.250
By the 660s, the Sasanian at
Persian Empire had collapsed,

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:10.710
and power in the Eastern
Mediterranean

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:15.070
and the near east had shifted
from the Byzantines to Arabs.

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:19.870
The construction of Zvart'nots'
between 640 and 660 thus took place

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:23.510 position:56%
at a critical transition in history,

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:27.150
which for many scholars
marks the dividing line

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:30.710
between late antiquity
and the Middle Ages.

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:35.760
A seventh century Armenian text,
the history attributed to Sebeos,

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:39.850
gives us precious insight
into this moment

00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:43.120 position:56%
from a local eyewitness perspective.

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:48.100 position:56%
This text is valued by historians of
Armenia, Byzantium and early Islam

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:52.520
for its detailed and reliable
testimony and its consideration

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:56.440
of Armenian affairs within
a much broader context.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:58.020
And it's particularly useful

00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:03.260 position:56%
for the information it gives
regarding the patron of Zvart'nots',

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:08.460
the patriarch Nerses, often called
the builder or [foreign word].

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:12.150
We learned from Sebeos
of Nerses' associations

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:16.260
with the Byzantine Empire and
Byzantine imperial interests.

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:20.350
In his earlier life we are told
Nerses studied their language,

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:22.540
Greek, and literature, and traveled

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:25.450
through their lands in
a military capacity.

00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:30.180 position:56%
The history also recounts how Nerses
accepted the Chalcedonian form

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:33.730
of Christianity adhered
to by the Byzantines.

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:38.150
Chalcedonianism called so for the
location of the church council

00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:44.250
in 451 professed that Christ's two
separate and human, separate human

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:49.050
and divine natures subsisted
in Christ as a unity.

00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:54.210 position:56%
This creed was officially rejected
by Armenians in 506 who instead held

00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:58.250
that the distinct humanity
and divinity of Christ resided

00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:02.430
as one nature, Miaphysite,
in the incarnate logos.

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:07.570
This may seem like a rather subtle
point but was incredibly important

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:10.060
at the time and created
a major schism

00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:12.830
between the Armenian
and Byzantine churches.

00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:16.380
And Nerses' Chalcedonian
Christianity thus placed him

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:20.560
in opposition to the
traditional Armenian church,

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:23.760
gained him favor with
the Byzantines.

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:28.440
And the Byzantines,
through the 640s and 650s,

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.690
sought to consolidate
power in Armenia

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:36.500
through both military campaigns
and also doctrinal pressures

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:39.970
to get the Armenians to
convert to Chalcedonianism.

00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:44.810
And in the 640s, the Byzantine
Emperor Constance even sought

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:48.660
to enforce this union
by forcing a communion,

00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:52.530
a Chalcedonian Eucharistic
service in Armenia.

00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:58.880 position:56%
And on his second visit, when he did
this, apparently Nerses participated

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.960
in the Byzantine liturgy and tried

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:04.300
to force his fellow
clergy to do the same.

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:08.590
Some took part, others didn't.

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:13.480
And maybe because of the latter who
were outraged at Nerses' betrayal

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:17.770 position:56%
of traditional Armenian
Christianity, Nerses went into exile

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:22.810
in Tyche, in northern, what
is now northeastern Turkey

00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:24.280
but was part of historical Armenia.

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:28.240
And from there he went
to Constantinople.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.990
So the history of Sebeos
gives us tremendous amount

00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:34.320
of detailed information
about Nerses.

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:39.470 position:56%
So between the emperor and the local
clergy, the local Armenian clergy,

00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:44.680
Nerses was faced with two powerful
constituencies, and the foundation

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:48.210
of Zvart'nots' must be
interpreted in connection

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:50.630
with their competing interests.

00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:54.820
Sebeos tells us that the church is
dedicated to the vigilant powers

00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:59.850
from where my book gets its
name, in Armenian Zvart'nots'.

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:05.480 position:56%
And these powers appeared in a
vision to the Armenian Saint Gregory

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:09.300
who was responsible for
converting Armenia to Christianity.

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:14.320
In his vision, Gregory saw
the vigilant powers as a host

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:18.890
of heavenly angels
[foreign language].

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:22.720
This is a very striking dedication
to the host of heavenly angels

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:28.260
and finds no precedent and invites
one to ask, why dedicate a church

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:33.120 position:56%
to a host of angels instead of let's
say through Saint Gregory himself.

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:37.000
Here we note that the name
Zvart'nots' is a punning illusion

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.170
to Gregory's own name.

00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:42.950
Because in Greek, Gregorigos
[phonetic] means vigilant

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:44.830
or watchful.

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:47.960
Since Nerses knew Greek,
it's entirely possible

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:52.370
that this linguistic play was
intended, and as for the host

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:56.000
of heavenly angels, the
Armenian word that we translate

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.500
as host is zork [phonetic] which,

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:03.640
like the Greek stratius [phonetic]
could hold meanings both angelic,

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:06.150
but also military.

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:09.990
And given the climate of the
seventh century eastern frontier

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:13.370
with is standing armies,
some of the most violent

00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:18.820
of the Byzantine Empire, such a
desire for supernatural protection

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:25.210
of an angelic sort would
have been most appropriate.

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:28.270
The precise location of
Zvart'nots' is also significant.

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:32.990
According to Sebeos, Nerses located
his church near the holy city

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:37.070
of Vagharshapat, today the
holy Sea of Etchmiadzin.

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:40.690
On a route associated with the
meeting between Saint Gregory

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:42.470
and the pagan King Tridate.

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:50.390 position:56%
Why, we might ask, did Nerses choose
this particular location on a road?

00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:55.010
He could have built it up
farther or down lower on the road.

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:59.560
And maybe one reason is that unlike
the previous Armenian patriarch

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:01.580
of Devin [phonetic]
patriarch [inaudible] Devin,

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:04.900
which was in Paris [phonetic]
Armenia in the Persian sector

00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:08.860
of Armenia, the location of
Zvart'nots' laid farther west,

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:12.290
closer to the Byzantine
controlled part of Armenia.

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:15.920
But another reason
concerns the landscape.

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:20.740
Zvart'nots' lies almost
directly north of Mount Ararat,

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:23.080
some 55 or 60 kilometers away.

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:27.790
And looking south to the
monuments, or really through it,

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:31.320
as you can now do, one sees
a perfectly centered image

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:32.620
of the mountain.

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:36.390
Of course, this is true for
many monuments in the proximity

00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:40.110
of Ararat, which is the
tallest mountain in Asia minor.

00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:44.000
But Zvart'nots' must have conveyed
a particularly strong effect

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.050
of graduated assent mounted on
an artificial circular terrace

00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:52.150
about 38 meters in diameter.

00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:55.500
Then on a stepped platform,
five meters tall.

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:58.780
An then on a second
stylobate of three steps.

00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:01.140 position:56%
The church rose in consecutive tiers

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:06.890
of diminishing diameter before
terminating in a drum and roof.

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:12.720 position:56%
The relationship between Zvart'nots'
and Ararat, is evoked not only

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:16.760
by topography and physical
form, but also by the tradition

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:19.070
of Armenia's Christianization.

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:23.050
The same fifth century conversion
narrative containing the vision

00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:27.300
of Gregory tells how the newly
Christian Armenian King Tirdate,

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:32.060 position:56%
he was converted by Gregory, climbed
Mount Ararat or musces [phonetic]

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:36.550
as Armenians call it, to cut
the stones for the constructions

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:40.040
of the first churches of Armenia.

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:45.420
So the strong visual parallel
that must have obtained winds

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:51.830
of Zvart'nots' withstanding with
Mount Ararat in the background,

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:55.330
it's hard to imagine that
this was not intended.

00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:56.780
So what did Nerses do?

00:30:56.780 --> 00:31:01.950
He moved his patriarchal
residence close to the sacred city

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:09.280
of Vagharshapat and in close
relationship with Mount Ararat,

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:12.610
thus creating a link
with both the holy city

00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:14.650
and with the holy mountain.

00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:18.650
The plan of Zvart'nots'
is as remarkable

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:20.620
as its setting and dedication.

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:22.200
Its type is commonly referred

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:25.710
to in the architectural
literature as an Aisled tetraconch.

00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:29.060
And this is a structure of two
shells, an inner and outer shell,

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:30.610
in which the inner one is formed

00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:34.460
of four curving spaces,
like a four-leaf clover.

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:37.730
Forms of this type exist
across the Mediterranean world

00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:40.410
and in the South Caucuses
too and Armenia and Georgia.

00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:43.050
There are at least three
churches of this type.

00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:45.090
But Zvart'nots' is the only church

00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:49.530
for which a seventh century
date is firmly established.

00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:52.520
According to the archeological
record, the largest group

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:57.990
of isle tetraconchs dates to about
450 to 550 and is found in Syria

00:31:57.990 --> 00:32:05.270
and Mesopotamia at [Foreign Names]
to name the confirmed examples,

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:09.130
stood fifth and sixth
century double shell design

00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:13.580
with a central quatrefoil
core in a protruding east end.

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:17.070
These monuments are similar to
Zvart'nots' also in their diameter,

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:21.070
so they're about the same in
terms of diameter, deviating only

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:25.460
about four meters from the
smallest example to the largest.

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:28.860
So this evidence has led a
lot of scholars to conclude

00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:32.720
that Zvart'nots' belong to
a family of like monuments

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:36.050
in southern Asia Minor,
and these similarities

00:32:36.050 --> 00:32:40.000
of these buildings seems
difficult to dispute.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.720
Yet, the designers of
Zvart'nots' modified the plan

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:48.430
of these Syrian Mesopotamia
tetraconchs in significant ways.

00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:52.760
First, the shape of its perimeter
wall does not reflect any

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:54.060
of the known precedence.

00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:57.600
Zvart'nots' presents the first
preserved and dated example

00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:02.110
of a circular exterior
enclosing a tetraconch.

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:06.660
Second, the designers of the
church also made a crucial addition

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:10.900
to the system of supports found
in the earlier tetraconchs.

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:16.590
And those blue circles
encircle the four single columns

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:19.210
that are adjacent to
the piers of the dome.

00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:20.710
So the ones that's
sort of marked square.

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:22.170
These don't occur before.

00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:24.430
So why are they there?

00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:26.260
From a spatial perspective,

00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:30.870
they occupy a critical
surface area in the ambulatory.

00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:34.590
But in agreement with virtually
all the scholars to-date,

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:40.070
I want to draw your attention
to the way those little columns,

00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:41.370
and let's see if I can point,

00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:49.400
actually create an intermediate
circle so you have, you have a,

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:51.450
well [inaudible], right, circle.

00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:56.260
And then the middle tier is
of this intermediate circle.

00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:58.960
And then you have the
small circle in the middle

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.260
which is the [inaudible].

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:06.150
And this can be seen more
clearly on the cross-section.

00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:09.270
I [inaudible] a cross section
where you have [inaudible] here.

00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:10.950
So this seems very
different from those Syrian

00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:14.310
and Mesopotamian tetraconchs.

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:20.140
And my belief is that this
adaptation of the Syrian

00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:23.640
and Mesopotamian tetraconchs
was generated in order

00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:27.990
to evoke the most famous
round monument of Christendom,

00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:33.730
the Anastasis Rotunda in
Jerusalem to which we now turn.

00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:37.270
Constructed in the fourth
century over the tomb of Christ,

00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:41.270
the Anastasis Rotunda played a
central role in this ritual life

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:45.000
of Christians across the medieval
world and was no less important

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.290
to the Christian faithful
in early medieval Armenia.

00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:51.420
While the archeology of this
building is even more complicated

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:54.740
than Zvart'nots', scholars
have proposed parallels

00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:59.000
between the two buildings, not only
in their circular perimeter walls,

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.270
but also their tiered construction,
sculpted capitals and even

00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:05.930
in their liturgical furniture.

00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:10.020
These visual parallels are
supported by the historical moment

00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:14.800
because seventh century Armenia
saw an increased interest

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:18.460
in the holy land as
attested in written sources.

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:22.270
We can consider, for example, a
description of the holy places

00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:26.180 position:56%
by the Armenian monk Hofsep
[phonetic], preserved in the history

00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:28.420
of the Caucasian Albanians.

00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:33.930 position:56%
Hofsep's account of the rotunda,
which he visited, gives measurements

00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:38.590
and many other details not found
in other medieval text, attesting,

00:35:38.590 --> 00:35:42.700
for example, to the offset
rather than central position

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:44.770
of the tomb under the dome.

00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:46.890
And on the left you see a plan,

00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:49.810
a new archeological plan
of the Holy Sepulchre.

00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:53.260
In the Anastasis Rotunda
you see that central form,

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:56.280
the two [inaudible] is not
centered within the circle.

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:59.960
Hofsep already attested to
that in the seventh century.

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:05.050 position:56%
Hofsep also tells us about there's a
gallery level above the angulatory.

00:36:05.050 --> 00:36:09.090
And also, he tells us the height
of the structure and the existence

00:36:09.090 --> 00:36:11.330
of the relics within this building.

00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:15.760
So this is a tremendously
important text that is neglected

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:19.580
by architecture historians
and archeologists.

00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:22.130
In addition to this text, we
know from contemporary sources

00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:25.980
that Armenians were aware of
and concerned about the welfare

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:30.580
of the sites and relics of the
holy land in the wake of the sack

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:34.180 position:56%
of Jerusalem by the Persians in 614.

00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:38.480 position:56%
And for these reasons, the
Anastasis Rotunda would have been an

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:43.780
appropriate model to reproduce
in seventh century Armenia.

00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:49.280
The elevation of Zvart'nots'
is as striking as its plan.

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:53.670
The arcades of the first tier were
composed of double colonnettes

00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:55.570
with capitals in the
shapes of lilies.

00:36:55.570 --> 00:36:59.110 position:56%
And here you have a sort of a detail

00:36:59.110 --> 00:37:01.010
of those capitals,
the lily capitals.

00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:05.430
And above those capitals
were molded arcades.

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:10.210
Between those arches in the
spandrels were human figures.

00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:16.100 position:56%
And because of the wedge shape of
the pictorial field, the upper torso

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:19.770
of the human figures is shown in
full width, while the lower part

00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:23.670
of the body is either concealed
behind he spandrel or squeezed

00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:25.590
into its narrowing space.

00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:29.020
And the example I just
showed you shows

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:33.200
that young men holding percussive
tools with short hair and a kind

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:37.340
of bloused garment and
then here are two more.

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:42.570
Again, they're holding building
tools which is very interesting.

00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:49.970 position:56%
Above this area was a sculpted field
filled with vegetal decoration.

00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:56.710
There were bunches of fruit,
pomegranates and grape vines.

00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:59.700
And then finally, at the op

00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:04.450
of this first tier was a
kind of lattice work cornus.

00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:07.530
So taken as a whole, this
is a striking composition,

00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:10.560
much more extravagant in
its details and elements

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:15.040
than any other surviving early
medieval Armenian church.

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:18.250
And scholars also noticed
that the specific comgination

00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:22.650
and organization of the lattice
work, the pomegranate motif

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:26.980
and the lily-shaped capitals
finds a parallel in descriptions

00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:31.500
of the temples in Jerusalem, which
likewise describes lattice work,

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:36.200
von tagas [phonetic], lily
capitals and bronze pomegranates.

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:40.070
So the visitor to Zvart'nots' may
have interpreted those builders

00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:41.370
on the facade.

00:38:41.370 --> 00:38:44.700
Not just as those involved with
the construction of a church,

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:48.420
but also with the builders
of the temple in Jerusalem

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:53.220
and with the renovators of the
rotunda after the Persian sack.

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:56.430
And maybe most important
about those builders,

00:38:56.430 --> 00:39:00.900
they glorify the act
of building itself.

00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:08.080
Excavations in the early 20th
century uncovered a sundial,

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:10.810
which is now housed in
the archeologic museum,

00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:13.640
and a modern reproduction
is kept outside.

00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:17.790
The Zvart'nots' dial is important,
both for its particular qualities

00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:21.510
and as a representative of a
robust but neglected corpus

00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:23.820
of medieval sundials in Armenia.

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:26.940
And it should be said that
medieval dials are not common

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:29.810
in the Byzantine world,
although they are known

00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:32.600
from places like the British Isles.

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:35.640
So by contrast, over 30 examples

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:38.700
from medieval Armenia alone
have been published thus far,

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:41.530
but this number is just a
fraction of the total surviving.

00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:45.930
So whenever you go to Armenia, go
to the south façade of the church

00:39:45.930 --> 00:39:47.930
and snap a picture if
you can find a sundial,

00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:49.720
you may very well take a picture.

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:52.300
They're trying to collect
these dials.

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:57.150 position:56%
The sundial of Zvart'nots' is the
earliest dated example from Armenia.

00:39:57.150 --> 00:39:59.410
All the evidence suggests
that it formed part

00:39:59.410 --> 00:40:02.510
of the original seventh century
complex, and it is also one

00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:06.050
of the few ancient dials
accompanied by a motto.

00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:10.790
The text reads in English, the
faithful shall pray to the Lord

00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:17.460
in a fit time [foreign language].

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:20.800
Most appropriate for an
instrument that by its position

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:25.000
on the church must have served
to regulate liturgical time

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.570
and indicate the appropriate
time for services.

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:33.830
This object finds a companion in
another neglected dial discovered

00:40:33.830 --> 00:40:37.250
by Robert Edwards in
1983 at the fortress

00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:40.080
of Oltu [phonetic] in Tyche.

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:41.700
It features Armenian numerals

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:47.470
and a fragmentary Greek
inscription reading Nerses, bishop.

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:52.810
Given this name, the bilingual
Greek and Armenian inscriptions,

00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:58.230
the tradition that places Nerses
in Tyche during his period of exile

00:40:58.230 --> 00:41:02.450
and his well-known interests
in architectural patronage,

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:06.680
it is most likely that this
dial is his and belongs

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:10.680
to a now last seventh
century church in Oltu.

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:15.150 position:56%
And if this is the case we can thank
sundials for mapping his movements.

00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:19.930
The program of sculpture
continues on the inside.

00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:24.540
The capitals of the Exedre
are large and finely carved

00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:29.490
with thick bulging baskets and
spiral volutes framing a medallion.

00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:32.350
These feature two different
cross monograms.

00:41:32.350 --> 00:41:34.690
One reads narsu [phonetic]
of Nerses,

00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:39.170
and the other reads
Catholico of the Catholicos.

00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:45.280
Note here that as with the Oltu
sundial, Nerses uses Greek.

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:48.880
He also uses it on a foundation
inscription for Zvart'nots'

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:51.690
which simply reads
Nerses made, remember.

00:41:51.690 --> 00:41:56.010
And it's possible to view
this use of Greek at a time

00:41:56.010 --> 00:41:59.720
when Armenian had become the
standard writing language

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:04.330
as further evidence of Nerses'
relation with the Byzantine Empire.

00:42:04.330 --> 00:42:08.780
The same can be said about the
use of Greek monogrammed capitals.

00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:12.290
Monograms, otherwise unattested

00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:15.590
in early medieval architecture
appear frequently

00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:18.040
on sixth century Byzantine
monuments,

00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:19.730
particularly in Constantinople.

00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:23.270
They are situated with grand
and impressing buildings,

00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:26.110
like the Church of
Saint Sergius and Bacchu

00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:29.200
and at the Hagia Sophia,
as you see here.

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:33.970
And they appear in the corner
exedre of the buildings

00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:39.750
in these curved spaces, just
like what we see at Zvart'nots'.

00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:41.900
So in light of Nerses' background,

00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:46.260
it's possible that he knew these
famous monuments of Constantinople

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:48.840
and sought to emulate
them in his own.

00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:54.820
On each side of the exedre,
four magnificent eagles,

00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:59.220
approximately one meter in height,
stood atop the single columns

00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:01.550
in front of the dome pierce.

00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:03.790
Two preserved eagles turn left.

00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:06.240
The other two turn right,
inviting us to think

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:12.360
about them facing each other
across the curvature of the exedre.

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:17.170 position:56%
Their impressive size and repetition
invites us to ask what they meant

00:43:17.170 --> 00:43:19.340
to a contemporary viewer.

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:22.770
Bird watchers know best their
magnificence and fierceness.

00:43:22.770 --> 00:43:28.060 position:56%
And these connotations also pervaded
the ancient and late antique world

00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:32.090
where eagles assumed multiple
and surely entangled connotations

00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:36.370
of divinity, sovereignty and
victory in battle and the hunt.

00:43:36.370 --> 00:43:40.740
In biblical Armenian and Syriac
[phonetic] textual traditions,

00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:42.940
eagles were not only the symbol

00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:47.610
of the evangelist John,
but also symbols of God.

00:43:47.610 --> 00:43:51.450
In the vision of Saint Gregory,
God appears in the likeness

00:43:51.450 --> 00:43:56.230
of a fleet-winged eagle,
reminding one of the extended wings

00:43:56.230 --> 00:44:00.540 position:56%
of the eagles at Zvart'nots' whose
upward curved feathers seemed poised

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:02.140
for flight.

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:03.450
In the Armenian tradition,

00:44:03.450 --> 00:44:06.640
eagles also had military
connotations the simile

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:08.290
of the swooping eagle
[foreign language],

00:44:08.290 --> 00:44:12.650
is found with great
frequency in the sources.

00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:15.400
And in the official
art of Byzantium,

00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:19.980
eagles embody worldly
authority and military power.

00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:23.980
Byzantine lead seals, and
you see an example below,

00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:28.590
provide a particularly compelling
comparison to Zvart'nots'

00:44:28.590 --> 00:44:35.170
because their iconography includes
both cross monograms and eagles.

00:44:35.170 --> 00:44:40.180
And it suggests that this seal
iconography might have been

00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:41.810
deliberately appropriated,

00:44:41.810 --> 00:44:44.940
particularly because
seals move easily,

00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:48.860
and their impressions
are distributed widely.

00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:53.670
Finally, eagles were
figures of the apocalypse.

00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:57.140
The Armenia history of CBS records
a prophecy based on the book

00:44:57.140 --> 00:45:01.530
of Daniel describing the four
great empires of the world.

00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:04.110
The first, the Byzantines
are represented

00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:06.240
by a lion with eagles wings.

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:10.890
These wings we are told, would be
plucked when the last great empire,

00:45:10.890 --> 00:45:15.330
the Arabs, came to exterminate
all who came before it.

00:45:15.330 --> 00:45:17.940
The massive outstretched
wings of the eagles

00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:22.610 position:56%
of Zvart'nots' may thus have evoked
not only the magnificence of empire,

00:45:22.610 --> 00:45:27.660
but also called to mind the
final days of the world.

00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:30.700
Before leaving our survey of
Zvart'nots' we need to make note

00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:37.320
of what for me is its most curious
element, the Urartian Stele.

00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:40.930
Discovered in 1900 during the
excavation, it bears a text

00:45:40.930 --> 00:45:47.670 position:56%
of 47 lines in Urartian Cuneiform
identifying the seventh century B.C.

00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:51.310
King Rusa the Second and his
building and irrigation works.

00:45:51.310 --> 00:45:54.650
The original location of
this stele is uncertain,

00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:56.910
but accounts of the
discovery make clear

00:45:56.910 --> 00:46:02.040
that it was discovered not below
the level of the church but rather

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:04.300
within its medieval context.

00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:09.630
The reports do not mention any
evidence for Urartian constructions

00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:13.850 position:56%
at Zvart'nots' which might otherwise
explain the presence of the stele.

00:46:13.850 --> 00:46:18.080
And it bears noting that the
stone's [inaudible] or base

00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:21.350
into which the stele was
inserted was never found,

00:46:21.350 --> 00:46:24.250
despite repeated searches.

00:46:24.250 --> 00:46:28.020
All of this invites us to
think about the possibility

00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:32.780 position:56%
that the stele was transported to
the site from its original location,

00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:34.550
whether near or far,

00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:37.810
and deliberately reused
during the building campaign

00:46:37.810 --> 00:46:39.130
of Nerses the Third.

00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:42.920 position:56%
And indeed the first
archeologists of Zvart'nots' assumed

00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:45.830
that it formed part
of the church portal.

00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:50.460
Such reuse of building
materials is not unusual.

00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:53.100
It was widely practiced
in the late antique

00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:56.360
and early medieval
churches in Byzantium.

00:46:56.360 --> 00:47:01.150
But while those churches
used classical spolia,

00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:02.740
and those churches, the use

00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:05.230
of classical spolia has
been carefully studied,

00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:09.040
much less attention has
been given to the reuse

00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:13.360
of building materials
in an Armenian context.

00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:18.610
In Armenia, recycled materials
derive for a much more remote past.

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:24.770
And they are separated by a
millennium from their new contexts.

00:47:24.770 --> 00:47:28.520
So we want to ask again,
why did this reuse occur?

00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:32.170
It seems very unlikely that it had
to do with building materials given

00:47:32.170 --> 00:47:36.510
that we're talking about an area
where stone was and is abundant.

00:47:36.510 --> 00:47:40.570
So I offer an extended
explanation in my book

00:47:40.570 --> 00:47:46.740
because the early medieval Armenian
texts offer a remarkable discussion

00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:51.650
of Cuneiform inscriptions
attributing them to the Assyrians,

00:47:51.650 --> 00:47:54.500
like the Queen Shamiram

00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:57.800
or to imperially appointed
Armenian governors and prefects.

00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:03.850
And taking such a medieval
understanding of the Urartian past

00:48:03.850 --> 00:48:09.450
into account, we can imagine that
Cuneiform with its visual message

00:48:09.450 --> 00:48:13.580
of antiquity and authority, would
have served a useful purpose

00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:18.160
for Nerses who's church and
residence could not boast

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:23.150 position:56%
like the holy Sea of Etchmiadzin, a
fourth century foundation tradition.

00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:26.340
And whose own status as
patriarch was contested

00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:28.080
by the local elites and clergy.

00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:31.770
And here's just another example of
a very interesting Urartian stele

00:48:31.770 --> 00:48:35.270
that was re-carved with a
cross in the Middle Ages.

00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:38.670
So far you should have a sense
of the tremendous richness

00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:42.030
of Zvart'nots' and its connections
to a great range of traditions

00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:43.940
and individual monuments.

00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:48.450
In its dedication and location,
its ground plan, inscriptions,

00:48:48.450 --> 00:48:52.440 position:56%
sculpture, Zvart'nots' can be
linked to Byzantium to the Holy Land

00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:57.510
to Syria, Mesopotamia and to local
Armenian forms and conventions.

00:48:57.510 --> 00:49:00.740
The complexity of this
monument and the diversity

00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:04.240
of its features has
frustrated attempts to assign it

00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:06.410 position:56%
to a single art historical category.

00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:11.290 position:56%
And arguments regarding the
origins of Zvart'nots' are divergent

00:49:11.290 --> 00:49:12.810
and sometimes contradictory.

00:49:12.810 --> 00:49:17.270
Scholars view it as a copy
of the Anastasis Rotunda,

00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:19.350
as one of a family of
buildings in Syria.

00:49:19.350 --> 00:49:23.090
As an evocation of
monuments in Constantinople.

00:49:23.090 --> 00:49:25.610
Or as a purely Armenian phenomenon.

00:49:25.610 --> 00:49:28.980
All of these arguments tend to
focus on one or another aspect

00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:31.740
of the monument rather than
treating it as a whole.

00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:37.530
And another way it's
discussed is as a mixture.

00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:43.390 position:56%
And Toramanian calls it a mixture or
[foreign word] of Roman Byzantine,

00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:45.000
Greek and Armenian styles.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.960 position:56%
So in closing I'd like to offer my
own view of the monument and suggest

00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:53.230
that in focusing strictly on the
formal and physical parallels

00:49:53.230 --> 00:49:56.320
for Zvart'nots', we have
ignored an alternative

00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:59.530
and perhaps even more
compelling body of evidence

00:49:59.530 --> 00:50:03.110
in contemporary written text.

00:50:03.110 --> 00:50:05.770
Armenian historical and
geographical writing

00:50:05.770 --> 00:50:09.580
of the seventh century shows
an unprecedented interest

00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:15.220
in situating Armenia within a
larger supra national sphere.

00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:19.070
The [foreign word] or
geography attributed

00:50:19.070 --> 00:50:23.270
to [foreign name] offers an
extended geographical description

00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:26.380
of the known world and
Armenia's position within it.

00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:28.990
It's the first line to
the text to have survived

00:50:28.990 --> 00:50:31.270
from early medieval
Armenia, and it is also one

00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:35.560
of the earliest preserved examples
of Armenian secular literature.

00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:36.950
The Anonymous Chronicle,

00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:42.120
another text from the seventh
century inserts Armenian historical

00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:47.090
notices into a broader
ecclesiastical history.

00:50:47.090 --> 00:50:51.650
The first part of the text outlines
world history and includes lists

00:50:51.650 --> 00:50:55.830
of Roman emperors and Susanian
kings and also includes a set

00:50:55.830 --> 00:50:59.250
of Armenian notices and traditions.

00:50:59.250 --> 00:51:01.200
So again, Armenian traditions,

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:06.160
like with the [foreign language]
are inserted into a broader frame.

00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:09.570
The history of [inaudible],
so important to the study

00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:13.460
of Zvart'nots' also offers
an instructive parallel

00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:17.110 position:56%
to Zvart'nots' fusion of traditions.

00:51:17.110 --> 00:51:20.270
This text offers a detailed
narrative of the period leading

00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:23.220
up to the early Arab
conquests, as I mentioned,

00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:25.690
and the conflicts among
the Byzantine Persian

00:51:25.690 --> 00:51:28.000
and Islamic powers.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.070
The history places Armenia again

00:51:30.070 --> 00:51:32.480
within a broader historical
tradition,

00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:35.130
considering extra national
events that were not

00:51:35.130 --> 00:51:38.670
of immediate local concern.

00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:43.990 position:56%
Scholars have observed over 25 years
ago that the universalizing nature

00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:47.070
of these texts may
have been motivated

00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:50.900
by the cataclysmic events
of the seventh century.

00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:54.280
The Persian capture
of Jerusalem in 614,

00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:57.010
the faltering of the
Byzantine Empire,

00:51:57.010 --> 00:52:01.100
the demise of the Susanian
Dynasty, and ultimately the arrival

00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:07.010
of the Arabs, all, and I quote
here scholar, require the expansion

00:52:07.010 --> 00:52:10.590
in both time and space of
the traditional framework

00:52:10.590 --> 00:52:13.700 position:56%
of Armenian national historiography.

00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:19.110
It was no longer possible to be
limited to purely local history.

00:52:19.110 --> 00:52:22.890
National Armenian historiography
necessarily opened itself

00:52:22.890 --> 00:52:24.530
to the universal.

00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:26.170
This is talking about
the seventh century.

00:52:26.170 --> 00:52:27.930
And as an art historian,

00:52:27.930 --> 00:52:33.170
I think this trend obtains
beyond the realm of text.

00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:36.660
In situating Armenia
within a universal frame,

00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:41.260 position:56%
whether in geographic, chronographic
or historical cosmic terms,

00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:45.720
seventh century writing finds a
powerful parallel in the church

00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:50.370
of Zvart'nots', the evidence we
have considered does not suggest a

00:52:50.370 --> 00:52:53.530
monument out of place
in a local context.

00:52:53.530 --> 00:52:55.980
On the contrary, it reveals one

00:52:55.980 --> 00:52:58.940
in which local traditions
were integrated

00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:03.890
within a broadly recognizable
set of forms and practices.

00:53:03.890 --> 00:53:08.490 position:56%
Like contemporary texts, Zvart'nots'
locates Armenian tradition

00:53:08.490 --> 00:53:12.030
within a much broader
geographical sweep.

00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:18.130
The written evidence thus allows us
to acknowledge rather than ignore

00:53:18.130 --> 00:53:22.400
or explain away the fusion
of traditions of Zvart'nots'

00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:26.680
and to interpret this fusion
as a deliberate attempt

00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:30.490
to mount a local shrine
on the world stage.

00:53:30.490 --> 00:53:32.630
In this sense, the study

00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:37.410
of Zvart'nots' demonstrates
the limitations

00:53:37.410 --> 00:53:39.640
of an exclusively visual analysis.

00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:45.520
At the same time, it shows the
degree to which material culture

00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:50.590
and architectural culture formed
part of the larger thought world

00:53:50.590 --> 00:53:52.740
of the seventh century frontier.

00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:56.000
All of this brings me to the
Dome of the Rock known to Muslims

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:59.870
as [foreign language]
or the noble sanctuary.

00:53:59.870 --> 00:54:02.420
Located in Jerusalem
on the Temple Mount,

00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:05.890
the Dome of the Rock was
completed in 691 to 2

00:54:05.890 --> 00:54:08.980
under the Umayyad Caliph
Abd al-Malik.

00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:12.080
Like Zvart'nots', it
draws its conspicuous plan

00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:13.790
from Byzantine building practices,

00:54:13.790 --> 00:54:16.850
most likely in Syria
and the Holy Land.

00:54:16.850 --> 00:54:18.410
Both Zvart'nots' and the Dome

00:54:18.410 --> 00:54:21.020
of the Rock are centralized,
aisled and domed.

00:54:21.020 --> 00:54:24.280
Both of them are distinguished
by their elevated position.

00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:26.190
The situation of the
Dome of the Rock

00:54:26.190 --> 00:54:30.150
on the temple mount recalls the
unusually tall polygonal platform

00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:31.450
of Zvart'nots'.

00:54:31.450 --> 00:54:34.250
And both the Christian and
the Islamic building rise

00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:37.140
in a series of successive tiers.

00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:38.460
The exterior of the
Dome of the Rock,

00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:41.850
particularly before the
Safavid era renovation

00:54:41.850 --> 00:54:45.800
with colored tiles would have
recalled Zvart'nots' the lowest

00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:49.590
level or data when you
see drawings on the right

00:54:49.590 --> 00:54:52.600
of a French archeologist,
Clermont Ganneau.

00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:56.580
The lowest level or data supported
a course of shallow based divided

00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:58.290
by pilasters and arcades.

00:54:58.290 --> 00:55:02.260
And above this was the parapet
with its original decoration

00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:06.400
of small arches divided
by double colonnettes.

00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:09.740
This parapet evokes the Zvart'nots'
because surviving fragments

00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:12.990
at the church indicate
that the inexistence

00:55:12.990 --> 00:55:15.040
of upper level of arcading.

00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:17.440
The interior mosaics and
tie beams of the Dome

00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:19.860
of the Rock present
rich vegetal forms

00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:24.150 position:56%
that include open lily-like flowers,
grapevines and pomegranates.

00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:27.510
And both churches remarkably,
and I'm not the one to say this,

00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:30.440
Lorenz Neace said it at
the University of Delaware.

00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:33.380
Both churches use eagle capitals.

00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:37.290
At the Dome of the Rock, these
capitals are partially faced,

00:55:37.290 --> 00:55:41.800
but they are in many
cases still discernable

00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:43.970
and form an interesting
point of correspondence

00:55:43.970 --> 00:55:47.930
with the eagle capitals on the
four domed piers of Zvart'nots'.

00:55:47.930 --> 00:55:53.080
Now, in outlining these
correspondences, I am not claiming

00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:55.930
that Zvart'nots' is a prototype
for the Dome of the Rock.

00:55:55.930 --> 00:55:59.790
So, let's just get that out there.

00:55:59.790 --> 00:56:04.590
I'm much less interested in
exploring the possible seriality

00:56:04.590 --> 00:56:07.310
of the relationship than
in placing these monuments

00:56:07.310 --> 00:56:09.190
in dialogue with each other.

00:56:09.190 --> 00:56:11.220
The physical evidence suggests ways

00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:15.130
in which their resemblance may
be linked to common sources

00:56:15.130 --> 00:56:18.690
of inspiration, most of
all the Anastasis Rotunda

00:56:18.690 --> 00:56:20.140
and the temple mount.

00:56:20.140 --> 00:56:23.880
If Zvart'nots' may be understood
to evoke these two holy sites

00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:27.960
in many different ways, the
features it shares with the Dome

00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:31.060
of the Rock may also be
linked to common sources

00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:34.510 position:56%
and similar strategies of emulation.

00:56:34.510 --> 00:56:36.810
It's also intriguing to reflect

00:56:36.810 --> 00:56:40.150
on the possible reasons
behind these strategies.

00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:43.190
The patrons of both
buildings rose to power

00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:45.630
in atmospheres of contestation.

00:56:45.630 --> 00:56:48.860
And both the Dome of the Rock
and Zvart'nots' may be seen

00:56:48.860 --> 00:56:53.780
as articulations of
legitimate and sacred authority.

00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:58.270
The assertion of this
authority in both the caliphal

00:56:58.270 --> 00:57:03.160 position:56%
and patriarchal commissions
resulted in powerful geometric forms

00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:05.870
in the consolidation
of older traditions,

00:57:05.870 --> 00:57:07.620
both imperial and sacred.

00:57:07.620 --> 00:57:13.230
And most of all in dramatic
marks on the landscape.

00:57:13.230 --> 00:57:16.740
Each building constitutes an
architectural focal statement,

00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:20.010
a visual magnet drawing
attention to itself.

00:57:20.010 --> 00:57:23.330
And if I'm correct in viewings
of Zvart'nots' as an attempt

00:57:23.330 --> 00:57:26.700
to mount the world stage of
the latter seventh century,

00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:29.670
both monuments can be
understood in relation

00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:33.880
to the dynamic changes brought
about by contemporary conflicts,

00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:37.360
and more specifically, the
ascendance of Arab control.

00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:40.030
So just to conclude.

00:57:40.030 --> 00:57:44.150
Produced by separate religious,
ethnic and political communities,

00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:48.340 position:56%
Zvart'nots' and the Dome of the Rock
are most often discussed separately.

00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:51.670
Yet they stand as remarkable
and complementary expressions

00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:56.130
of their age and of the
potential for monuments to respond

00:57:56.130 --> 00:57:59.980
and to give shape to a
dynamic moment in history.

00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:04.090
And for these reasons, Zvart'nots'
serves not only as a symbol

00:58:04.090 --> 00:58:09.170
of the modern nation of Armenia,
but also as a world monument.

00:58:09.170 --> 00:58:10.970
Thank you very much.

&gt;&gt; Levon Avdoyan: I think
you now see why I thought

00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:31.340
that Dr. Maranci would
be the perfect.

00:58:31.340 --> 00:58:33.660
Thank you Mr. Ambassador.

00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:36.370
He's called away for meetings.

00:58:36.370 --> 00:58:38.800
We certainly appreciate
his presence.

00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:43.990
At all events I want to tell you
that Dr. Maranci's book is not only

00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:48.270
about Zvart'nots', it's also about
two other seventh century churches,

00:58:48.270 --> 00:58:53.170
Maran [phonetic], which is in sad
shape, and Dr. Maranci has called

00:58:53.170 --> 00:58:56.710
for universal help in
guaranteeing its survival

00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:58.010
and the Church of [inaudible].

00:58:58.010 --> 00:59:00.260
It was published by [inaudible].

I am not supposed to be a commercial
up here, but if you're interested

00:59:03.830 --> 00:59:07.710
in her lecture you would be
interested in her superb book.

00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:09.020
Thank you, Christina.

00:59:09.020 --> 00:59:12.330
It was truly wonderful
food for thought.

00:59:12.330 --> 00:59:18.490
And speaking of food for thought, I
now invite you to a marvelous lunch

00:59:18.490 --> 00:59:22.840
that the Lebanese Taverna
has provided for us.

00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:25.980
And I look forward to seeing
each and every one of you

00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:27.930
at the next Vardanants Day lecture.

00:59:27.930 --> 00:59:29.230
Thank you.
