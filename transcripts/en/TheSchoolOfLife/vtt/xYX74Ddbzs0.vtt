00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.060
We tend to learn self-pity when we're young.  Maybe

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.600
it was a sunny Sunday afternoon; you were
nine years old. Your parents wouldn’t let

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.770
you have any ice cream if you didn’t do
your maths homework. It was achingly unfair.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.820
Every other child in the world was playing
football or watching TV. No one else

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.692
has such a mean mother. It was just awful.

00:00:21.692 --> 00:00:27.279
We’re all – in theory – dead against self-pity.  It seems deeply unattractive because it reveals

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:33.239
egoism in its most basic form, a failure to
put our own suffering into proper perspective

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.659
against the larger backdrop of human history.

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:40.439
We lament our tiny disasters  and look coldly on the grand tragedies of the world.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.380
A problem with one's fringe, or a wrongly cooked steak.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.920
Dominates the mind while we ignore the working conditions in China and the gini coefficient of Brazil.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.780
No one likes to own up to self-pity.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.680
And yet, if we are honest it's something we feel quite often.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.180
And in fact it's often rather a sweet and indeed important emotion.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:07.680
The fact is we do deserve a great deal more pity than other people are ever very likely to bestow upon us.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.640
Life is in truth horrendously hard in many ways.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.920
Even if one does have a top notch data plan and an elegantly designed fridge.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.920
Our talents are never fairly recognised.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.960
Our best years will necessarily drift away.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.280
We won't find all the hope.  We won't find all the love we need.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.040
We deserve pity and there isn't anyone else around to give it to us.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.120
So we have to supply a fair dose of it to ourselves.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.460
The operative cause might, from a lofty perspective, seem ridiculous.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:43.800
Poor me, I'll never drive a Ferrari. It's so sad. I thought we were going to a Japanese restaurant and they have booked a pub.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.820
But these are just the convenient opportunities for immersing ourselves in a much bigger issue.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.820
The fundamental sorrows of existence for which we do genuinely deserve the most tender compassion.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.580
Imagine what things would be like if we couldn’t pity ourselves.  We would be that far worse category of

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.520
mental discomfort - depressed.  The depressed person is someone who has lost the art of self pitty.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.540
Who has become too rigorous with themselves

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.840
If you think of a parent comforting a child, they often spend hours on very minor things.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.760
A lost toy, Nunu's broken eye, the children's party to which one wasn't invited.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.200
They are not being ridiculous.  They are in effect teaching the child how to look
after themselves.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.900
And giving space to the important idea that small upsets can have very large internal consequences.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.240
Gradually we learn to mimik this parental attitude and come to be able
to feel sorry for ourselves when no one else

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.400
will. It’s not necessarily entirely rational,
but it’s a coping mechanism. A first protective

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.640
shell which we develop in order to be able
to manage some of the immense disappointments

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.989
and frustrations that life throws at us. The
defensive posture of self-pity is far from

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.670
contemptible. It is touching and important.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.510
Many religions have given expression to this attitude by inventing deities

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.000
who look with inexpressible pity upon human beings.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.880
In Catholicism for instance, the Virgin Mary is often presented as weeping out of tenderness for the miseries of the normal human life.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:20.200
Such kindly divine beings are really just projections of our own need to be pitied.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.060
Self-pity is compassion that we extend to ourselves.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.060
A more mature aspect of the self, turns to the weak and lost parts of a psyche

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:35.940
and comforts them, strokes them, tells them it understands and that they are indeed lovely but misunderstood.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.800
It allows them to be, for a while, a bit babyish.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.360
Since that is, actually, what we all are in large part.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:50.000
It provides the undemanding, confirming love that every baby, but far more importantly every adult

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.040
needs to get through the anguish of existence.
