DAN FELD: Hi.

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.695
Welcome to Founders World
2015 here in Pier 27

00:00:04.695 --> 00:00:06.890
in San Francisco.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.940
And here with me today--

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.630
CONAN REIS: Is Conan Reis.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:11.498
DAN FELD: What's up?

00:00:11.498 --> 00:00:13.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.870
CONAN REIS: Well, uh, we
do a video game programming

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.790
language, and when
you tell people

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.490
you're bringing a new
language into the world,

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.440
the first response is
generally, you're nuts.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.130
DAN FELD: You're nuts.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.780
Yeah, absolutely.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.446
CONAN REIS: And so
we're in the business

00:00:27.446 --> 00:00:29.800
of doing the things where
they say, you can't do that.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.650
And we say, yes, we can.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.500
So it's a very mad
scientist ethos,

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.614
so we call ourselves
mad computer scientists.

00:00:37.614 --> 00:00:38.280
DAN FELD: It is.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.290
And I think that worked very
well looking at the expo floor

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.320
here and people that
have surrounded you.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:44.700
CONAN REIS: Yeah.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.074
DAN FELD: I think
it works great.

00:00:46.074 --> 00:00:49.000
Also, I think it's two
days after the "Back

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.770
to the Future"--

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.600
CONAN REIS: Yes.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.230
Yes.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.230
DAN FELD: --big day so--

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.710
CONAN REIS: We definitely
Tweeted about that.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:54.543
DAN FELD: Well done.

00:00:54.543 --> 00:00:56.720
CONAN REIS: Fans of Doc Brown.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.720
DAN FELD: Aren't we all?

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:58.412
CONAN REIS: Yes.

00:00:58.412 --> 00:01:00.620
DAN FELD: So tell us a little
bit about this language

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.420
and what can we do with it?

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.240
CONAN REIS: Well, it's only
taken 20 years to make,

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.410
so it's the next
overnight success story.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.880
DAN FELD: Sounds like a
great entrepreneurship cycle.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.588
CONAN REIS: Yeah.

00:01:11.588 --> 00:01:13.530
So in the video
game industry, lots

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.030
of the different
components that you

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.990
use to make video games,
physics, animation, graphics,

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.840
all those different
systems, they've

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.150
kind of become commoditized.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.076
You can get amazing things
for free, for, you know,

00:01:27.076 --> 00:01:28.720
hundreds of
thousands of dollars,

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.180
but the game play part
of games, generally,

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.374
each company will make those
sorts of things from scratch.

00:01:35.374 --> 00:01:37.290
And then when they're
done, their amazing game

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.140
and their amazing tech,
they throw it away.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.120
And every single game after
iteration after iteration,

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.100
they have to build it
from scratch every time.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.170
And when I started in the
industry about 22 years ago,

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.760
I thought that was crazy.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.600
And it made sense that we
would make that aspect of game

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.110
development easier.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.840
And a lot of it had
to do with things

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.970
like concurrency,
all sorts of things

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.360
happening at the same time.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.645
Interactivity.

00:02:00.645 --> 00:02:02.270
DAN FELD: But perhaps
decode it for us.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.315
I know I'm not an
expert in this,

00:02:04.315 --> 00:02:06.840
but I know that there
are engines like Unity

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.060
and others that that's
supposed to give you

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.082
some platform for
repetition, right?

00:02:12.082 --> 00:02:12.790
CONAN REIS: Sure.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.970
But all of the tools
that have generally

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.650
been used in the
industry still are

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.440
languages that you can add
in some of those things

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.890
after the fact, but it's
not native to the language.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.620
So to make interactive concepts
a native part of the language,

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.630
it dramatically
changes the workflow

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.920
in terms of how
people do things.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.750
Usually to do a game that does
something that takes time,

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.850
you have to break up time into
tiny little bits and pieces

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.010
every frame.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.450
And to think about
that as us mere humans,

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.640
it's not a natural process.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.900
That's not how we think.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.460
So this language
enables you to be

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.820
able to describe things
in a more natural way.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.660
These five things or thousand
things happen at the same time,

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.660
and when, you know, the
first of them completes,

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.550
do this other thing.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.140
And cue the music and
the bad guys come in.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.465
And, you know, all of those
simultaneous actions that

00:03:08.465 --> 00:03:12.170
are happening, most of
the computer languages,

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.420
those are sort of add on
things from the operating

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.974
system or just to describe it
takes ages of complex code.

00:03:18.974 --> 00:03:19.640
DAN FELD: It is.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.264
CONAN REIS: But with
SkookumScript, you

00:03:21.264 --> 00:03:23.050
can describe the
same sorts of things

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.830
in just a couple of lines.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.155
So the understanding of
being able to-- like,

00:03:29.155 --> 00:03:31.950
the main problem in software
engineering is we're

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.470
stuck with the
brains than we have.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.053
DAN FELD: Yes.

00:03:34.053 --> 00:03:36.780
CONAN REIS: And we have to fit
only what we can, you know,

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:37.720
hold in our brains.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.340
So if you can do the
most interesting things

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.380
with a very short
amount of code,

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.190
then you can fit a
lot more in your head.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.330
DAN FELD: And also, I
assume that you have--

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.104
you can put less energy
into the engineering--

00:03:52.104 --> 00:03:52.770
CONAN REIS: Yes.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.211
DAN FELD: --and more energy into
the content and the innovation

00:03:56.211 --> 00:03:57.960
and the difference
that you want to bring.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.010
CONAN REIS: Precisely.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.880
DAN FELD: And would
that be something

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.690
that is ready to roll?

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.225
What would be the call
for action for anyone

00:04:05.225 --> 00:04:07.580
that wants to take a shot at it?

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.390
CONAN REIS: Well, it's been
evolving in the games industry

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.090
as sort of an in-house
tool for many years,

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.850
but we've thought
now is the time

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.140
to get it out across the
entire game industry.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.320
So we're just starting
to release it.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.410
We've been doing it sort
of in a closed beta.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.050
It's hooked up as a free
plug-in with the Unreal Engine,

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.090
and that is supposed to be on
their marketplace as a code

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.560
plug-in in a couple weeks to a
month or something like that.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.210
So everyone will be
able to get it for free

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.220
and start using it
and playing with it.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.350
And everything it does
is also in real time.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.390
So unlike a lot of languages,
you can type in some code

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.150
and see immediately how
it's changing things.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.470
So if some character's
acting in some weird way,

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.880
instead of shutting it
down, making your change,

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.320
recompiling-- and some
of the big projects,

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.900
it's half an hour to
rebuild-- in SkookumScript,

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.550
you can make your change live
while the game is running

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.847
and see the little guys that
you have running around acting

00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:06.430
and behaving--

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:07.230
DAN FELD: Live change.

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:08.230
CONAN REIS: --instantly.

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.020
DAN FELD: Where do
you find this product?

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.826
What do people--

00:05:10.826 --> 00:05:12.076
CONAN REIS: skookumscript.com.

00:05:12.076 --> 00:05:13.840
DAN FELD: Oh, I see.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.821
CONAN REIS: And soon on the
Unreal marketplace as a plug-in

00:05:17.821 --> 00:05:19.070
into their development system.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.310
And it will work
on all platforms.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.464
DAN FELD: Excellent.

00:05:22.464 --> 00:05:23.630
That's great, and good luck.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.310
We are looking forward to that.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.260
Perhaps a few words
about your background and

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.769
how did you-- about your
professional background?

00:05:30.769 --> 00:05:33.060
CONAN REIS: Oh, so I've been
in the video game industry

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.480
for many years.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.300
I studied cognitive
science and AI,

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.390
and so the big part of what
I've been wanting to do

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:46.980
is make it easier to have
the computer take on as much

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:51.610
of the effort it can to help
us develop things, right?

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.900
I mean, languages
and stuff that we've

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.395
worked with used to
have to work on systems

00:05:56.395 --> 00:05:58.290
that were really underpowered.

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.450
But these days, everybody has
a supercomputer on their phone

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.560
in their pocket, so there's no
reason that the computers can't

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.010
do more for us.

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.990
So I've always thought about
intelligent agents and AI.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:14.210
And so I'm trying to bring
that sort of intelligence

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:18.810
into languages and compiling
and what you describe,

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.460
your crazy ideas
of the stories you

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.875
want to tell, to put into this.

00:06:23.875 --> 00:06:29.060
My background is I started
at Electronic Arts in Canada,

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.690
had my own company, made
the first sort of language,

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:37.210
got a big government grant
to do it, went to Lucas Arts

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.760
here in San Rafael and worked
on some languages there.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.450
I actually made a language
called Chewy script,

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:46.875
after Chewbacca, because he's
the engineer in the Star Wars

00:06:46.875 --> 00:06:47.375
universe.

00:06:47.375 --> 00:06:49.290
So if you got an
error, it would go--

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:50.690
[CHEWBACCA NOISE]

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.960
And then went back and started
working on SkookumScript,

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.230
and that was in 2004 in Canada.

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:58.190
DAN FELD: Wow.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:02.810
CONAN REIS: And so it's-- then
used it internally in United

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:06.250
Front Games in their
"Sleeping Dogs" game.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.420
That was a big open world game.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:12.090
And now they are using it to
build "Triad Wars," which is

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:13.820
a massively multiplayer game.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.570
And now we want to get
it so that everyone

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:18.710
in the entire game development
industry can use it.

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:20.960
And even outside of games, too.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.160
Robotics, aerospace
industries, anything

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.850
that does real time automation
would benefit from this.

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:31.380
Any high-level sort of
stage direction-type stuff.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:32.540
DAN FELD: Outstanding.

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:36.410
And perhaps I will ask you
the same identical questions

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:37.440
we ask everyone.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:42.060
What's your favorite or
most used Google product?

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.386
CONAN REIS: Well, like
many, it's probably,

00:07:44.386 --> 00:07:46.540
you know, just Search.

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:49.270
But, I mean, we use
Google Analytics.

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:52.850
It's hooked into our product
to track and figure out

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:54.380
how things are being used.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.880
And very soon, hopefully,
lots of Android

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.145
use, because with
games there's going

00:08:00.145 --> 00:08:03.697
to be lots of people writing
SkookumScript Android games.

00:08:03.697 --> 00:08:05.030
DAN FELD: Looking forward to it.

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:06.350
Thank you very much, Conan.

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:06.655
CONAN REIS: Thank you.

00:08:06.655 --> 00:08:07.488

00:08:07.488 --> 00:08:09.910

much for watching.
