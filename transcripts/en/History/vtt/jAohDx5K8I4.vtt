00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.620
All right, gentlemen,
welcome to the strength test.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.170
Now, everybody knows
in a Hollywood movie

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.330
there comes a point where
the hero-- that's me--

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.000
is being chased by a
group of inept villains.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.710
That's them.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.830
Now, the survival knife has to
be capable of dismantling booby

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.580
traps.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.670
To test the strength and overall
construction of your blade,

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.380
I'll be using your knife
to break the spikes

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.420
off our man killer over here.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.420
Mike, you're up first.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.420
You ready?
- I'm ready.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.040
OK.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.170
The test I saw earlier just
goes to show that they're

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.210
going to have no
mercy on these knives,

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.710
so I am a little bit nervous.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.540
[rock music playing]

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.290
I'd put that in a movie.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.290
[laughs] It indexes beautifully.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.380
And your finger wells line
up really, really nicely.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.750
Your blade, there's
not a mark on it.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:17.790
Nicely done.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:18.790
Thank you.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:19.540
Trystan, you're up.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.290
Are you ready?

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.790
Yes, sir.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.540
I already know I
have a hard edge.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.420
But these tests are brutal, and
they really can bring out all

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.790
the flaws in anyone's blade.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.120
So it's still anyone's game.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.460
[rock music playing]

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.670
Nice.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.670
All right, Trystan, you've
got right here just a small roll

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.080
that I can feel.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.080
There's another glint
down here on the edge.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.830
But the biggest
issue is that pommel

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.790
has kicked over to
the side because it

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.830
was whacking into my wrist.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.500
Designing a knife,
having a spike

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.120
come this way towards your hand,
is really never a good idea.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.500
Thank you.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.500
I'll remember that for
the rest of my life.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.500
All right, Brian,
you ready for this?

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.580
I'm ready.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.330
I don't know if the knife is.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.540
Seeing this log with all the
spikes sticking out of it,

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.620
it reminds me of the movies,
you know, "Predator" or "Rambo."

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.210
It's very exciting
to see the test

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.330
and watch David do what he does.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.290
That is--

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:48.540
David picks up my knife.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.330
He's taken a look at
it, trying to figure

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.880
out where to put the lanyard.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.880
And he puts it
back in his pocket.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.290
This isn't a good sign.

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.170
Brian, I really appreciate
a good work around.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.710
And you're really
shooting for one here.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.210
And you worked really hard.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.460
That last 30 minutes,
you pushed hard.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.880
But this isn't a through
tang with a pommel.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.250
This is a hidden tang
and a frame handle.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.000
Understood.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.670
Brian, your blade failed
to meet round 2 parameters.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.080
For that reason, I have to ask
you to please leave the forge.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.710
Thank you.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.420
I completely agree
with the judges,

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.420
and I understand
why I'm going home.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.080
But my family, we don't
throw in the towel.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.040
We always keep going.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.710
When I get home, I'm going to
hug my kiddos, kiss my wife,

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.920
probably take a sweet nap,
and then get back to forging.
