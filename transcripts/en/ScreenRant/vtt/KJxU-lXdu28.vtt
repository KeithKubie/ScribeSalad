00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:12.680
It’s nearly impossible for any film these
days to be 100% truly original.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.539
Movies have been made for so long that just
about everything is influenced by some kind

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:18.230
of pre-existing work.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.109
Sometimes, directors can’t help but show
their love for other projects, and they make

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.660
their tastes very well known to the audience.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.529
You may not notice it at first, but some of
the most popular scenes in your favorite films

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.780
strongly resemble – or rip-off, if you will
– sequences that made their way to the big

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.340
screen much earlier.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.510
Here are 10 famous movie scenes that were
stolen from other movies.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.780
Star Wars

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.329
One of the most triumphant finales in all
of cinema happens in the original Star Wars,

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.640
where Luke and Han receive medals for their
contributions during the Battle of Yavin.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.460
Just the music alone is enough to make anyone
swell up with pride.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.870
So, its potential origins might surprise the
most devout Jedi Knights.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.170
The Rebel’s ceremony is eerily reminiscent
of a sequence in the Nazi propaganda film

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.500
Triumph of the Will depicting a party rally.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.750
Traces of World War II can definitely be felt
in the Star Wars franchise, but typically

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.860
it’s the Empire meant to stand in for Hitler.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.530
We didn’t know the heroes were fond of him
too.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.299
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.130
Sam and Frodo’s journey through Middle-earth
is exceptionally dangerous, even when they

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.330
find a guide in the form of Gollum.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.390
The creature brings the Hobbits to the Black
Gate of Mordor so Frodo can complete his quest,

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.740
but Sauron’s army is there on the scene
making things difficult.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.240
The trio of heroes is forced to hide and peer
over a ledge, and this sequence calls to mind

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.799
a similar scene from another fantasy classic.

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.180
The Wizard of Oz features a moment where characters
are right outside the Wicked Witch’s castle,

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.579
trying to stay out of the villains’ sight.

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.200
It wouldn’t be a shock if Jackson was a
fan of Oz, seeing that the film has long been

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.869
a favorite.

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:51.869
Boogie Nights

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:52.869
P.T.

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.590
Anderson’s Boogie Nights is essentially
the adult film version of Martin Scorsese’s

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.580
Goodfellas, and that influence was readily
apparent from the opening moments.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.280
Anderson begins his movie with a sweeping
one-take tracking shot of a club, introducing

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.880
viewers to all the principal characters from
the ensemble.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.250
It’s an impressive sequence, and it has
traces of Goodfellas’ famous Copacabana

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.420
tracking shot that left a huge impression
on viewers.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.760
There, Henry Hill used his standing in the
mob to take a short cut through the restaurant

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.090
and get a table, greeting various employees
along the way.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:31.560
Anderson may not have blatantly ripped off
Scorsese, but the inspiration is apparent.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.560
The Shining

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.620
In horror films, few moments are as iconic
as Jack Nicholson’s terrifying “Here’s

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.940
Johnny!” sequence, where the actor takes
an axe to a bathroom door so he can try to

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.840
attack his wife and kid.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.959
It’s become so ingrained in the pop culture
zeitgeist, that it’s almost impossible to

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.230
imagine anyone else doing it first.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.400
But Stanley Kubrick may have taken some pointers
from the silent Swedish horror film The Phantom

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.000
Carriage, which features a scene that’s
nearly identical to the one shown in The Shining,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.370
including the same setup and weapon of choice.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.569
Kubrick altered this scene from the novel,
so we may know his source now.

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:10.650
Pulp Fiction

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.690
Quentin Tarantino famously – or infamously
depending on your point of view – wears

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.450
his influences on his sleeves.

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.520
He unapologetically borrows from his favorite
films, putting his own spin on certain scenes.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.569
In Pulp Fiction, he looked to Alfred Hitchcock
for one of the more tense moments.

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:30.460
As Butch is on the run, he coincidentally
sees Marsellus Wallace – who he had double-crossed

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.520
– crossing the street.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.310
It’s heavily designed after a bit in Psycho,
where Marion Crane pulls to a crosswalk and

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.420
notices her boss on the road.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:44.980
The key difference is that Butch ran Marsellus
over, while Marion just slowly drove away.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.670
Raiders of the Lost Ark

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.670
George Lucas and Steven Spielberg were clear
in admitting that the old adventure serials

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.989
they watched in their youths influenced the
Indiana Jones series.

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.210
It would seem they also went through the filmography
of Charlton Heston.

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.280
Raiders of the Lost Ark features a sequence
where Indiana locates the resting place of

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.989
the Ark of the Covenant using the Staff of
Ra and his gold medallion.

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.540
It echoes a scene in the Heston vehicle Secret
of the Incas, where Heston’s character solves

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.830
a puzzle using a medallion of his own and
a beam of light.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.660
The similarities look like more than a coincidence.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.660
E.T.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.620
– The Extra Terrestrial

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.910
Ask anyone to provide an example of pure movie
magic, and the bikes flying in ET will be

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.340
commonly cited.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.550
Few scenes have become so clearly synonymous
with the awe and wonder of cinema, and the

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.440
imagery even served as the basis for Spielberg’s
production company logo.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.270
One of the director’s favorite films is
Miracle in Milan, and he paid homage to that

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.480
work with the flying bit in ET.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.780
Milan includes a sequence where the main characters
are cornered by authorities and make a grand

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.070
escape by flying on broomsticks.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:52.450
Audiences in 1951 were probably just as taken
with this as 1982 viewers were when ET took

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.160
flight.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.440
The Untouchables

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.510
Director Brian de Palma has more than a few
great crime dramas to his name, and one of

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.000
his best-known offerings is The Untouchables.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.670
That film is famous for the shootout in Union
Station, which featured the now famous image

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.080
of a baby carriage rolling down the steps
amidst the chaos.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.230
In all likelihood, de Palma modeled this sequence
after a similar scene in the silent film Battleship

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:20.040
Potemkin, which showcased a carriage falling
down the Odessa steps as gunshots were going

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.040
off.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.170
The one from The Untouchable has obviously
become the more iconic, but de Palma might

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:29.480
have been trying to give more recognition
to a silent era classic.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.080
Kill Bill: Volume 1

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.480
Quentin Tarantino has a fondness for Kung
Fu and old school karate movies, and they

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.630
are among the many he makes reference to in
his own filmography.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:43.210
Those curious to see how that genre influenced
him can take a look at Kill Bill, most notably

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.410
the Bride’s fight against the Crazy 88s.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.870
In it, the Bride is surrounded by swarms of
enemies looking for the opportune moment to

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:50.870
kill her.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.180
It’s very similar to a sequence from Fists
of Fury, which features Bruce Lee’s character

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.690
in a nearly identical situation.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.240
Cinephiles easily made the comparison, and
if the reaction to Kill Bill is any indication,

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.880
they enjoyed this bit of homage.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:04.880
Blade Runner

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.960
The final scene of Blade Runner primarily
consists of shots of the great outdoors as

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.630
Deckard drives away with Rachael.

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:14.540
It seems more than a little out of place with
the futuristic dystopian setting that Ridley

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.440
Scott had established for his film, and as
it turns out, there’s a good reason for

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.440
that.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.220
After wrapping, Scott’s producers wanted
wilderness shots, but inclement weather and

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.660
time constraints prevented Scott from getting
them.

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.770
He called Stanley Kubrick and asked if he
could take some footage from the opening of

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:30.770
The Shining.

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:48.000
It’s not all the same, but it’s very close
due to being from the same area.
