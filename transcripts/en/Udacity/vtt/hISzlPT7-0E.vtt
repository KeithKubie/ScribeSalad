[Norvig] My answer is defining property names would be a fine design choice.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It would probably help us understand what's going on in the definition of the program.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Defining groups without names would also be fine.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Ignoring the groups I think would not work, and here's the problem.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We have to know that if red is assigned to house number 2,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
then blue cannot be assigned to house number 2,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
but orange juice can be assigned to house number 2.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So there's this idea that properties within a group are mutually exclusive

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and properties outside of the group are not.

00:00:34.000 --> 99:59:59.000
We need to represent that in some way.
