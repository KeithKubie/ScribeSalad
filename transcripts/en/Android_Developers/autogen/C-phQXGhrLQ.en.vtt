00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:01.560
when we find a backup and the user
 

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.800
when we find a backup and the user
decides to restore it the restore

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:03.810
decides to restore it the restore
 

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:06.410
decides to restore it the restore
happens in two stages first we restore

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:06.420
happens in two stages first we restore
 

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:08.030
happens in two stages first we restore
your chats and what I mean by that is

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:08.040
your chats and what I mean by that is
 

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.070
your chats and what I mean by that is
really just the chat database which is

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:10.080
really just the chat database which is
 

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.840
really just the chat database which is
kind of mostly just text messages

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:11.850
kind of mostly just text messages
 

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.090
kind of mostly just text messages
doesn't include any media so that's a

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:14.100
doesn't include any media so that's a
 

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.700
doesn't include any media so that's a
smaller portion of the backup right and

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:16.710
smaller portion of the backup right and
 

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:18.380
smaller portion of the backup right and
we do this synchronously so we don't let

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:18.390
we do this synchronously so we don't let
 

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:19.700
we do this synchronously so we don't let
the user into the app until this

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:19.710
the user into the app until this
 

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:22.490
the user into the app until this
finishes there's a reason for that when

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:22.500
finishes there's a reason for that when
 

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.110
finishes there's a reason for that when
the user actually ends up in the app we

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:24.120
the user actually ends up in the app we
 

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.700
the user actually ends up in the app we
want them to see all their chats right

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:25.710
want them to see all their chats right
 

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:27.170
want them to see all their chats right
away right otherwise they're going to

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:27.180
away right otherwise they're going to
 

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:27.910
away right otherwise they're going to
think something my

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:27.920
think something my
 

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.530
think something my
what might have gone wrong we lost some

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:29.540
what might have gone wrong we lost some
 

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:31.660
what might have gone wrong we lost some
of their data or something like that so

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:31.670
of their data or something like that so
 

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:32.949
of their data or something like that so
we restore the chat database

00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:32.959
we restore the chat database
 

00:10:32.959 --> 00:10:34.379
we restore the chat database
synchronously

00:10:34.379 --> 00:10:34.389
synchronously
 

00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:36.550
synchronously
however with media because that

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:36.560
however with media because that
 

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.079
however with media because that
represents such a large portion of the

00:10:38.079 --> 00:10:38.089
represents such a large portion of the
 

00:10:38.089 --> 00:10:39.730
represents such a large portion of the
overall backup size we do that

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:39.740
overall backup size we do that
 

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:41.470
overall backup size we do that
asynchronously so we let you into the

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:41.480
asynchronously so we let you into the
 

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.759
asynchronously so we let you into the
app and if you look at the bottom

00:10:42.759 --> 00:10:42.769
app and if you look at the bottom
 

00:10:42.769 --> 00:10:44.410
app and if you look at the bottom
screenshot here we basically restore the

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:44.420
screenshot here we basically restore the
 

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:45.910
screenshot here we basically restore the
media in the background and we kind of

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:45.920
media in the background and we kind of
 

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.379
media in the background and we kind of
tell you that at the top of your chat

00:10:47.379 --> 00:10:47.389
tell you that at the top of your chat
 

00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:50.620
tell you that at the top of your chat
list this means the user doesn't have to

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:50.630
list this means the user doesn't have to
 

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:52.540
list this means the user doesn't have to
sit around waiting for a huge backup to

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:52.550
sit around waiting for a huge backup to
 

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:54.280
sit around waiting for a huge backup to
restore potentially right and if they

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:54.290
restore potentially right and if they
 

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:55.810
restore potentially right and if they
have slow Network or they're you know

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:55.820
have slow Network or they're you know
 

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.610
have slow Network or they're you know
doing this over cellular for some reason

00:10:57.610 --> 00:10:57.620
doing this over cellular for some reason
 

00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.860
doing this over cellular for some reason
that way there in the app ready to go in

00:10:59.860 --> 00:10:59.870
that way there in the app ready to go in
 

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:01.480
that way there in the app ready to go in
their media will restore we actually

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:01.490
their media will restore we actually
 

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:03.210
their media will restore we actually
restore your most recent media first

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:03.220
restore your most recent media first
 

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.889
restore your most recent media first
right which makes sense because you you

00:11:05.889 --> 00:11:05.899
right which makes sense because you you
 

00:11:05.899 --> 00:11:07.360
right which makes sense because you you
know you're most likely to see that in

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:07.370
know you're most likely to see that in
 

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:09.970
know you're most likely to see that in
your chat history and we're always

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:09.980
your chat history and we're always
 

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.769
your chat history and we're always
monitoring network conditions right so

00:11:11.769 --> 00:11:11.779
monitoring network conditions right so
 

00:11:11.779 --> 00:11:13.840
monitoring network conditions right so
you know we pause the restore if you're

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:13.850
you know we pause the restore if you're
 

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:15.790
you know we pause the restore if you're
if you drop off Wi-Fi or if your battery

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:15.800
if you drop off Wi-Fi or if your battery
 

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.699
if you drop off Wi-Fi or if your battery
gets low or things like that I'll make

00:11:18.699 --> 00:11:18.709
gets low or things like that I'll make
 

00:11:18.709 --> 00:11:20.560
gets low or things like that I'll make
one comment about the UI here we

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:20.570
one comment about the UI here we
 

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:22.180
one comment about the UI here we
actually designed some animations and

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:22.190
actually designed some animations and
 

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:24.370
actually designed some animations and
the restore process and the reason we

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:24.380
the restore process and the reason we
 

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:25.900
the restore process and the reason we
thought this was actually important was

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:25.910
thought this was actually important was
 

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:27.939
thought this was actually important was
so that the user has an extra indication

00:11:27.939 --> 00:11:27.949
so that the user has an extra indication
 

00:11:27.949 --> 00:11:29.860
so that the user has an extra indication
that progress is happening right so the

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:29.870
that progress is happening right so the
 

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:31.990
that progress is happening right so the
dots animate in the top screenshot or

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:32.000
dots animate in the top screenshot or
 

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.939
dots animate in the top screenshot or
those two arrows animate in the bottom

00:11:33.939 --> 00:11:33.949
those two arrows animate in the bottom
 

00:11:33.949 --> 00:11:35.019
those two arrows animate in the bottom
screenshot letting the user know

00:11:35.019 --> 00:11:35.029
screenshot letting the user know
 

00:11:35.029 --> 00:11:37.240
screenshot letting the user know
something's going on when the restore is

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:37.250
something's going on when the restore is
 

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:38.829
something's going on when the restore is
paused or something's not happening we

00:11:38.829 --> 00:11:38.839
paused or something's not happening we
 

00:11:38.839 --> 00:11:40.540
paused or something's not happening we
actually stop those animations so just

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:40.550
actually stop those animations so just
 

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:41.920
actually stop those animations so just
reinforce in the UI

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:41.930
reinforce in the UI
 

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:43.720
reinforce in the UI
to the user what's actually going on and

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:43.730
to the user what's actually going on and
 

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:45.939
to the user what's actually going on and
from there you get your chats back and

00:11:45.939 --> 00:11:45.949
from there you get your chats back and
 

00:11:45.949 --> 00:11:53.860
from there you get your chats back and
you're ready to go

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:53.870
 

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:55.990
okay so we've had a pretty clear look

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.000
okay so we've had a pretty clear look
 

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.850
okay so we've had a pretty clear look
from the on the product side for how

00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:57.860
from the on the product side for how
 

00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.650
from the on the product side for how
this works both in terms of backup and

00:11:59.650 --> 00:11:59.660
this works both in terms of backup and
 

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:01.180
this works both in terms of backup and
restore flows which are the two main

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:01.190
restore flows which are the two main
 

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:03.130
restore flows which are the two main
flows in this integration let's back up

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:03.140
flows in this integration let's back up
 

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:05.170
flows in this integration let's back up
a little bit and from a backup from a

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:05.180
a little bit and from a backup from a
 

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:06.580
a little bit and from a backup from a
higher level view and check out the

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:06.590
higher level view and check out the
 

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:08.200
higher level view and check out the
architectural overview for how the

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:08.210
architectural overview for how the
 

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:14.710
architectural overview for how the
overall system works so like all good

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:14.720
overall system works so like all good
 

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.060
overall system works so like all good
architecture diagrams first off these

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:16.070
architecture diagrams first off these
 

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:18.280
architecture diagrams first off these
these colors I spent a lot of time on so

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:18.290
these colors I spent a lot of time on so
 

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:20.350
these colors I spent a lot of time on so
I hope that they work all good

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:20.360
I hope that they work all good
 

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.760
I hope that they work all good
architecture diagrams start with the

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:21.770
architecture diagrams start with the
 

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:23.470
architecture diagrams start with the
storage server storage services on the

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:23.480
storage server storage services on the
 

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.670
storage server storage services on the
bottom the kind of the clients at the

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:24.680
bottom the kind of the clients at the
 

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.590
bottom the kind of the clients at the
top and that's what we have here right

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:26.600
top and that's what we have here right
 

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.080
top and that's what we have here right
so notice the drive clients and whatsapp

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:29.090
so notice the drive clients and whatsapp
 

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:31.450
so notice the drive clients and whatsapp
client on the top the very bottom you

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:31.460
client on the top the very bottom you
 

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:34.000
client on the top the very bottom you
have both whatsapp and Google Drive

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:34.010
have both whatsapp and Google Drive
 

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:36.670
have both whatsapp and Google Drive
back-end server technologies so on dry

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:36.680
back-end server technologies so on dry
 

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.290
back-end server technologies so on dry
side we'll see this a few times in this

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:38.300
side we'll see this a few times in this
 

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.240
side we'll see this a few times in this
integration there's two key services

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:40.250
integration there's two key services
 

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:42.520
integration there's two key services
involved in accept in managing files

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:42.530
involved in accept in managing files
 

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:43.090
involved in accept in managing files
right

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:43.100
right
 

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.700
right
there's the service that handles binary

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:45.710
there's the service that handles binary
 

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:47.620
there's the service that handles binary
file content so the actual content of

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:47.630
file content so the actual content of
 

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:49.420
file content so the actual content of
the file and then all of the metadata

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:49.430
the file and then all of the metadata
 

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:51.730
the file and then all of the metadata
which is stored separately and optimized

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:51.740
which is stored separately and optimized
 

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:53.140
which is stored separately and optimized
differently because it's a different

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:53.150
differently because it's a different
 

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:55.000
differently because it's a different
kind of use case so things like title

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:55.010
kind of use case so things like title
 

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:56.770
kind of use case so things like title
and mime type of course there's a

00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:56.780
and mime type of course there's a
 

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:58.630
and mime type of course there's a
business logic on top of that and a good

00:12:58.630 --> 00:12:58.640
business logic on top of that and a good
 

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.820
business logic on top of that and a good
caching layer probably many caching

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:00.830
caching layer probably many caching
 

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:02.560
caching layer probably many caching
layers the solution to all known

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:02.570
layers the solution to all known
 

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:04.060
layers the solution to all known
computer science problems and quite a

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:04.070
computer science problems and quite a
 

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:06.250

so we actually use the HTTP API for

00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:16.100
so we actually use the HTTP API for
 

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:19.000
so we actually use the HTTP API for
Google Drive rather than the drive Java

kind of big and I was pushing us up

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:23.030
kind of big and I was pushing us up
 

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:25.000
kind of big and I was pushing us up
against our 64k method limit so we

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:25.010
against our 64k method limit so we

decided to go with the HTTP API it's
 

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:28.210
decided to go with the HTTP API it's
also a little bit more flexible in terms

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:28.220
also a little bit more flexible in terms
 

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:29.740
also a little bit more flexible in terms
of how we could design some of the calls

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:29.750
of how we could design some of the calls
 

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:32.140
of how we could design some of the calls
that we were making I also want to

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:32.150
that we were making I also want to
 

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:33.730
that we were making I also want to
mention the backup window right when do

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:33.740
mention the backup window right when do
 

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:37.120
mention the backup window right when do
we actually backup and we do this to

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:37.130
we actually backup and we do this to
 

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:39.280
we actually backup and we do this to
optimize we choose a backup window that

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:39.290
optimize we choose a backup window that
 

00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:41.980
optimize we choose a backup window that
optimizes for whether the person's phone

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:41.990
optimizes for whether the person's phone
 

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:43.600
optimizes for whether the person's phone
is going to be charged and connected to

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:43.610
is going to be charged and connected to
 

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:45.820
is going to be charged and connected to
Wi-Fi so we think usually that this

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:45.830
Wi-Fi so we think usually that this
 

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:47.830
Wi-Fi so we think usually that this
happens at night right when you're

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840
happens at night right when you're
 

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:48.310
happens at night right when you're
sleeping

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:48.320
sleeping
 

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:49.840
sleeping
so you charge your phone at night if

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:49.850
so you charge your phone at night if
 

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:51.280
so you charge your phone at night if
you're at home you probably have Wi-Fi

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:51.290
you're at home you probably have Wi-Fi
 

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:52.450
you're at home you probably have Wi-Fi
so we kind of optimize for that

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:52.460
so we kind of optimize for that
 

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:55.060
so we kind of optimize for that
condition so we basically say we pick a

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:55.070
condition so we basically say we pick a
 

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:57.130
condition so we basically say we pick a
four hour window it's something but I

00:17:57.130 --> 00:17:57.140
four hour window it's something but I
 

00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:58.180
four hour window it's something but I
think it's like 2:00 and 6:00 a.m.

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.630
between 2:00 and 6:00 a.m. and we
basically for a given user randomize

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:01.640
basically for a given user randomize
 

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:03.520
basically for a given user randomize
when they'll back up the reason we

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:03.530
when they'll back up the reason we
 

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:05.200
when they'll back up the reason we
choose a random time for the user to

choose a random time for the user to
backup it so that we don't really bring

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:07.280
backup it so that we don't really bring
 

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:08.980
backup it so that we don't really bring
down Google servers by having a bunch of

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:08.990
down Google servers by having a bunch of
 

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:10.450

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.320
have their phones wake up at 2:00 a.m.
take a backup off right this would this

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:14.330
take a backup off right this would this
 

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:16.210
take a backup off right this would this
would be pretty bad so we kind of choose

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:16.220
would be pretty bad so we kind of choose
 

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:18.070
would be pretty bad so we kind of choose
a random window that helps us really get

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:18.080
a random window that helps us really get
 

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:21.010
a random window that helps us really get
where we want and of course we're always

looking for Network conditions battery
 

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:25.600
looking for Network conditions battery
etc right so we won't take a backup off

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:25.610
etc right so we won't take a backup off
 

00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:27.370
etc right so we won't take a backup off
if your phone's battery is low we won't

you are in those proper conditions we'll
just start the back up right so if I am

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:35.570
just start the back up right so if I am

but the truth is there were a lot of
 

00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:29.620
but the truth is there were a lot of
challenges along the way and we're gonna

the world right and so we're really
 

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:06.020
the world right and so we're really
interested in making sure that we're

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:06.030
interested in making sure that we're
 

00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:07.520
interested in making sure that we're
using only the amount of data that we

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:07.530
using only the amount of data that we
 

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:09.169
using only the amount of data that we
need to use making sure that's efficient

00:23:09.169 --> 00:23:09.179
need to use making sure that's efficient
 

00:23:09.179 --> 00:23:11.090
need to use making sure that's efficient
and trying to speed things up right

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:11.100
and trying to speed things up right
 

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:12.590
and trying to speed things up right
trying to make backups quick restores

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:12.600
trying to make backups quick restores
 

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:15.650
trying to make backups quick restores
quick so one of the primary ways we do

00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:15.660
quick so one of the primary ways we do
 

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:17.720
quick so one of the primary ways we do
this is backups are incremental right

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:17.730
this is backups are incremental right
 

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:19.250
this is backups are incremental right
for the most part so this means that if

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:19.260
for the most part so this means that if
 

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:21.799
for the most part so this means that if
I backed up a photo one day I don't need

00:23:21.799 --> 00:23:21.809
I backed up a photo one day I don't need
 

00:23:21.809 --> 00:23:23.390
I backed up a photo one day I don't need
to go and back that up the next time I

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:23.400
to go and back that up the next time I
 

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.549
to go and back that up the next time I
go ahead and kick off a backup make

00:23:25.549 --> 00:23:25.559
go ahead and kick off a backup make
 

00:23:25.559 --> 00:23:28.910
go ahead and kick off a backup make
sense one of the other ways we do this

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:28.920
sense one of the other ways we do this
 

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:31.220
sense one of the other ways we do this
is we actually have byte level resumes

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:31.230
is we actually have byte level resumes
 

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:33.140
is we actually have byte level resumes
for uploads and downloads of every file

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:33.150
for uploads and downloads of every file
 

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:35.240
for uploads and downloads of every file
so if I'm uploading a photo and the

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:35.250
so if I'm uploading a photo and the
 

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:36.770
so if I'm uploading a photo and the
connection drops and for some reason I

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:36.780
connection drops and for some reason I
 

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:38.240
connection drops and for some reason I
don't finish it I can actually just

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:38.250
don't finish it I can actually just
 

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:40.340
don't finish it I can actually just
resume at the byte level that upload

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:40.350
resume at the byte level that upload
 

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:42.800
resume at the byte level that upload
right really efficient to do that dosnt

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:42.810
right really efficient to do that dosnt
 

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:44.419
right really efficient to do that dosnt
so this especially comes in handy with

00:23:44.419 --> 00:23:44.429
so this especially comes in handy with
 

00:23:44.429 --> 00:23:46.040
so this especially comes in handy with
larger media files if you think about a

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:46.050
larger media files if you think about a
 

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:47.120

we also optimized a lot of our API calls

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:53.370
we also optimized a lot of our API calls
 

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:55.820
we also optimized a lot of our API calls
we do batch deletes who removed files

need to delete those files on a Google

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:03.570
need to delete those files on a Google
 

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:05.060
need to delete those files on a Google
Drive so we patched those up and do it

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:05.070
Drive so we patched those up and do it
 

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:07.730
Drive so we patched those up and do it
and when we're fetching files at the

and when we're fetching files at the
 

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:09.500
and when we're fetching files at the
time of restore we actually fetch the

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:09.510
time of restore we actually fetch the
 

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:12.050
time of restore we actually fetch the

actually do that the last thing I'll say
 

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.440
actually do that the last thing I'll say
is when we're actually fetching the

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:07.170
because you're writing to multiple
 

00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:08.840
because you're writing to multiple
systems you're dealing with you know

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:08.850
systems you're dealing with you know
 

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:10.490
systems you're dealing with you know
four or five megabyte files you're

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:10.500
four or five megabyte files you're
 

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:12.620
four or five megabyte files you're
buffering things you're chunking you're

00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:12.630
buffering things you're chunking you're
 

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:14.570
buffering things you're chunking you're
opening up upload sessions you're

00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:14.580
opening up upload sessions you're
 

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:15.860
opening up upload sessions you're
finalizing them you're writing the

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:15.870
finalizing them you're writing the
 

00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:17.420
finalizing them you're writing the
metadata one once that's done you're

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:17.430
metadata one once that's done you're
 

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:19.970
metadata one once that's done you're
doing post processing post processing we

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:19.980
doing post processing post processing we
 

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:21.860
doing post processing post processing we
have to do this super reliably what does

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:21.870
have to do this super reliably what does
 

00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:23.630
have to do this super reliably what does
a reliable mean well that I mean that's

00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:23.640
a reliable mean well that I mean that's
 

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.000
a reliable mean well that I mean that's
a varying degree but in general if you

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:26.010
a varying degree but in general if you
 

00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:28.130
a varying degree but in general if you
are talking about for example only one

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:28.140
are talking about for example only one
 

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:29.960
are talking about for example only one
in a hundred thousand or one in a

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:29.970
in a hundred thousand or one in a
 

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:32.120
in a hundred thousand or one in a
million requests failing in that kind of

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:32.130
million requests failing in that kind of
 

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:34.790
million requests failing in that kind of
range that's pretty good because for the

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:34.800
range that's pretty good because for the
 

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:37.100
range that's pretty good because for the
requests that do fail a simple retry

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:37.110
requests that do fail a simple retry
 

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:39.140
requests that do fail a simple retry
will certain who likely clear it up and

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:39.150
will certain who likely clear it up and
 

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:41.570
will certain who likely clear it up and
users will have will generally have no

00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:41.580
users will have will generally have no
 

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:44.720

idea so for knives for example is a kind

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:44.730
idea so for knives for example is a kind
 

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:46.280
idea so for knives for example is a kind
of a reasonable target and it's quite a

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:46.290
of a reasonable target and it's quite a
 

00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:48.290
of a reasonable target and it's quite a
feat when you're talking about writing

00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:48.300
feat when you're talking about writing
 

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:53.510
feat when you're talking about writing
data at that scale so despite all our

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:53.520
data at that scale so despite all our
 

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.130
data at that scale so despite all our
best efforts for reliability things

00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:55.140
best efforts for reliability things
 

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:57.050
best efforts for reliability things
actually do go wrong and this is

00:26:57.050 --> 00:26:57.060
actually do go wrong and this is
 

00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:59.180
actually do go wrong and this is
actually a you know handling errors is

00:26:59.180 --> 00:26:59.190
actually a you know handling errors is
 

00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:00.500
actually a you know handling errors is
actually both an engineering challenge

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:00.510
actually both an engineering challenge
 

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:03.590
actually both an engineering challenge
as well as a user experience challenge

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600
as well as a user experience challenge
 

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:07.340
as well as a user experience challenge
here's why when something goes wrong you

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:07.350
here's why when something goes wrong you
 

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:08.840
here's why when something goes wrong you
don't want to constantly tell the user

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:08.850
don't want to constantly tell the user
 

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:10.370
don't want to constantly tell the user
that something is wrong right otherwise

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:10.380
that something is wrong right otherwise
 

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:11.630
that something is wrong right otherwise
they start to think your service is

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:11.640
they start to think your service is
 

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.880
they start to think your service is
reliable this is especially true for

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:13.890
reliable this is especially true for
 

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:17.330
reliable this is especially true for
things that happen that where we can

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:17.340
things that happen that where we can
 

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:19.070
things that happen that where we can
recover gracefully from them so I'll

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:19.080
recover gracefully from them so I'll
 

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.919
recover gracefully from them so I'll
give you an example let's say the users

00:27:21.919 --> 00:27:21.929
give you an example let's say the users
 

00:27:21.929 --> 00:27:23.570
give you an example let's say the users
phone isn't on in the backup window

00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:23.580
phone isn't on in the backup window
 

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:25.610
phone isn't on in the backup window
right so their phone is off at night we

00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:25.620
right so their phone is off at night we
 

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:27.560
right so their phone is off at night we
you know realize we can't perform a

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:27.570
you know realize we can't perform a
 

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:29.600
you know realize we can't perform a
backup at 2:00 a.m. we'll just wait and

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:29.610
backup at 2:00 a.m. we'll just wait and
 

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:31.310
backup at 2:00 a.m. we'll just wait and
defer the backup until later in the day

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:31.320
defer the backup until later in the day
 

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.590
defer the backup until later in the day
when the proper conditions are met same

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:33.600
when the proper conditions are met same
 

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:36.410
when the proper conditions are met same
is true for network sometimes we get

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:36.420
is true for network sometimes we get
 

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:38.180
is true for network sometimes we get
miscellaneous server errors right like

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:38.190
miscellaneous server errors right like
 

00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:40.460
miscellaneous server errors right like
error like fight like err 500 that we

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:40.470
error like fight like err 500 that we
 

00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:41.660
error like fight like err 500 that we
don't really know exactly what's going

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:41.670
don't really know exactly what's going
 

00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:42.110
don't really know exactly what's going
on

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:42.120
on
 

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:43.820
on
so we just kind of wait we try the

00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:43.830
so we just kind of wait we try the
 

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:46.760
so we just kind of wait we try the
backup again if it works it works if it

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:46.770
backup again if it works it works if it
 

00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:48.860
backup again if it works it works if it
doesn't we're still kind of silent about

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:48.870
doesn't we're still kind of silent about
 

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:52.100
doesn't we're still kind of silent about
it and I'll tell you when we're not so

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:52.110
it and I'll tell you when we're not so
 

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:53.810
it and I'll tell you when we're not so
we have a class of errors where it

00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:53.820
we have a class of errors where it
 

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:55.430
we have a class of errors where it
actually so that's a class of errors

00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:55.440
actually so that's a class of errors
 

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:56.900
actually so that's a class of errors
that sort of we can recover silently

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:56.910
that sort of we can recover silently
 

00:27:56.910 --> 00:27:58.340
that sort of we can recover silently
from but we've also got this class of

00:27:58.340 --> 00:27:58.350
from but we've also got this class of
 

00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:00.950
from but we've also got this class of
errors would that require user action in

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960
errors would that require user action in
 

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.290
errors would that require user action in
order to recover from so a great example

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:03.300
order to recover from so a great example
 

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:04.910
order to recover from so a great example
of this is authentication let's say you

00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:04.920
of this is authentication let's say you
 

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:06.860
of this is authentication let's say you
go and change your Google password right

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:06.870
go and change your Google password right
 

00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:08.100
go and change your Google password right
you forget to update it on

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:08.110
you forget to update it on
 

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:09.930
you forget to update it on
Android device well at this point we

00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:09.940
Android device well at this point we
 

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:12.090
Android device well at this point we
can't actually authenticate into Google

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:12.100
can't actually authenticate into Google
 

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:14.610
can't actually authenticate into Google
Drive in order to backup so we actually

00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:14.620
Drive in order to backup so we actually
 

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:16.710
Drive in order to backup so we actually
tell the user immediately for that type

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:16.720
tell the user immediately for that type
 

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:18.180
tell the user immediately for that type
of an error to go resolve this issue

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:18.190
of an error to go resolve this issue
 

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:19.770
of an error to go resolve this issue
because we know that no matter how many

00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:19.780
because we know that no matter how many
 

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:21.570
because we know that no matter how many
times we're gonna try this backup it's

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:21.580
times we're gonna try this backup it's
 

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:23.280
times we're gonna try this backup it's
never gonna work unless the user does

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:23.290
never gonna work unless the user does
 

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:24.169
never gonna work unless the user does
something about it

00:28:24.169 --> 00:28:24.179
something about it
 

00:28:24.179 --> 00:28:27.120
something about it
another good class another good type of

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:27.130
another good class another good type of
 

00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:28.650
another good class another good type of
error that have another type of error

00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:28.660
error that have another type of error
 

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:30.990
error that have another type of error
that happens in this category is storage

00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:31.000
that happens in this category is storage
 

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.340
that happens in this category is storage
issues right let's say you run out of

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:32.350
issues right let's say you run out of
 

00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:34.049

out of storage those types of things
again we tell the user explicitly please

00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:37.540
again we tell the user explicitly please
 

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:39.900
again we tell the user explicitly please
go fix this thing so for the errors that

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:39.910
go fix this thing so for the errors that
 

00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:41.460
go fix this thing so for the errors that
we can kind we think we can recover

00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:41.470
we can kind we think we can recover
 

00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:43.560
we can kind we think we can recover
gracefully from what we do is we keep

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:43.570
gracefully from what we do is we keep
 

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:45.690
gracefully from what we do is we keep
trying and we don't tell the user this

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:45.700
trying and we don't tell the user this
 

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:49.110
trying and we don't tell the user this
backup hasn't occurred for several days

00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:49.120
backup hasn't occurred for several days
 

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:51.780
backup hasn't occurred for several days
right so say I have daily backup set one

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:51.790
right so say I have daily backup set one
 

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:54.000
right so say I have daily backup set one
day the backup doesn't work we just kind

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:54.010
day the backup doesn't work we just kind
 

00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:55.980
day the backup doesn't work we just kind
of wait we try it the next day if it

00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:55.990
of wait we try it the next day if it
 

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:59.070
of wait we try it the next day if it
works it works great we kind of if by I

00:28:59.070 --> 00:28:59.080
works it works great we kind of if by I
 

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:00.630
works it works great we kind of if by I
think like the fourth or fifth day at

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:00.640
think like the fourth or fifth day at
 

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:01.919
think like the fourth or fifth day at
that point will tell the user something

00:29:01.919 --> 00:29:01.929
that point will tell the user something
 

00:29:01.929 --> 00:29:04.620
that point will tell the user something
maybe he's not going on but really we're

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:04.630
maybe he's not going on but really we're
 

00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:08.280
maybe he's not going on but really we're
trying to just do this graceful in the

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:08.290
trying to just do this graceful in the
 

00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:09.900
trying to just do this graceful in the
the balance we're really trying to

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:09.910
the balance we're really trying to
 

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:11.520
the balance we're really trying to
strike of course is you don't want to

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:11.530
strike of course is you don't want to
 

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:12.990
strike of course is you don't want to
annoy the user into thinking this thing

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:13.000

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.730
annoy the user into thinking this thing
isn't working but also you want the user

00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:14.740
isn't working but also you want the user
 

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:16.770
isn't working but also you want the user
to actually be able to back their stuff

00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:16.780
to actually be able to back their stuff
 

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:18.630
to actually be able to back their stuff
up because even losing one two three

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:18.640
up because even losing one two three
 

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:20.460
up because even losing one two three
four days of messages could be pretty

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:20.470
four days of messages could be pretty
 

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:22.409
four days of messages could be pretty
painful sometimes right hurts to lose

00:29:22.409 --> 00:29:22.419
painful sometimes right hurts to lose
 

00:29:22.419 --> 00:29:25.250
painful sometimes right hurts to lose
that data

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:25.260
 

00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:26.880
okay let's talk a little bit about

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:26.890
okay let's talk a little bit about
 

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:28.950
okay let's talk a little bit about
rollout we're gonna cover this in detail

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:28.960
rollout we're gonna cover this in detail
 

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.620
rollout we're gonna cover this in detail
so how did we roll this out well we

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:31.630
so how did we roll this out well we
 

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:32.909
so how did we roll this out well we
distribute what's happened two ways

00:29:32.909 --> 00:29:32.919
distribute what's happened two ways
 

00:29:32.919 --> 00:29:35.669
distribute what's happened two ways
we've got an apk download that we

00:29:35.669 --> 00:29:35.679
we've got an apk download that we
 

00:29:35.679 --> 00:29:38.370
we've got an apk download that we
distribute on our website and we have

00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:38.380
distribute on our website and we have
 

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:39.630
distribute on our website and we have
also distributed through the Play Store

00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:39.640
also distributed through the Play Store
 

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:41.310
also distributed through the Play Store
obviously a vast majority of our users

00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:41.320
obviously a vast majority of our users
 

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:43.620
obviously a vast majority of our users
get it from the Play Store what this

00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:43.630
get it from the Play Store what this
 

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:44.850
get it from the Play Store what this
means however is that you can actually

00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:44.860
means however is that you can actually
 

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:47.610
means however is that you can actually
test things test updates with the

00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:47.620
test things test updates with the
 

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:49.740
test things test updates with the
website population so that it because

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:49.750
website population so that it because
 

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:51.780
website population so that it because
the population is small and you can kind

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:51.790
the population is small and you can kind
 

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:53.159
the population is small and you can kind
of actually use that almost like a beta

00:29:53.159 --> 00:29:53.169
of actually use that almost like a beta
 

00:29:53.169 --> 00:29:55.770
of actually use that almost like a beta
testing pool so we started there and we

00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:55.780
testing pool so we started there and we
 

00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:57.210
testing pool so we started there and we
did this as a percentage rollout so we

00:29:57.210 --> 00:29:57.220
did this as a percentage rollout so we
 

00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:58.830
did this as a percentage rollout so we
said hey we'll roll this out to 5% of

00:29:58.830 --> 00:29:58.840
said hey we'll roll this out to 5% of
 

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:00.750
said hey we'll roll this out to 5% of
our website users and then ramp that up

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:00.760
our website users and then ramp that up
 

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:03.120
our website users and then ramp that up
and then we did a percentage roll out

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:03.130
and then we did a percentage roll out
 

00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:05.310
and then we did a percentage roll out
for our Play Store users percentage

00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:05.320
for our Play Store users percentage
 

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:06.570
for our Play Store users percentage
rollouts really important obviously

00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:06.580
rollouts really important obviously
 

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:08.700
rollouts really important obviously
because we don't want to just turn this

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:08.710
because we don't want to just turn this
 

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:10.380
because we don't want to just turn this
on all at once we want to find the bugs

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:10.390
on all at once we want to find the bugs
 

00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:12.120
on all at once we want to find the bugs
that we have in the client we want to

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:12.130
that we have in the client we want to
 

00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:13.799
that we have in the client we want to
make sure the server's can handle it all

00:30:13.799 --> 00:30:13.809
make sure the server's can handle it all
 

00:30:13.809 --> 00:30:15.090
make sure the server's can handle it all
those types of things right so we

00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:15.100
those types of things right so we
 

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:16.409
those types of things right so we
monitored this very closely because

00:30:16.409 --> 00:30:16.419
monitored this very closely because
 

00:30:16.419 --> 00:30:18.000
monitored this very closely because
again we're dealing with user data this

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:18.010
again we're dealing with user data this
 

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:19.320
again we're dealing with user data this
stuff is precious you don't want to

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:19.330
stuff is precious you don't want to
 

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:20.430
stuff is precious you don't want to
screw it up

00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:20.440
screw it up
 

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:22.480
screw it up
of course even when you're doing your

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:22.490
of course even when you're doing your
 

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:24.010
of course even when you're doing your
percentage rollout one thing to keep in

00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:24.020
percentage rollout one thing to keep in
 

00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:25.720
percentage rollout one thing to keep in
mind is that there are there is a

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:25.730
mind is that there are there is a
 

00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:28.660
mind is that there are there is a
natural user upgrade cycle right so say

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:28.670
natural user upgrade cycle right so say
 

00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:30.550
natural user upgrade cycle right so say
we ship you know a version of whatsapp

00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:30.560
we ship you know a version of whatsapp
 

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:32.770
we ship you know a version of whatsapp
with Google Drive in it we enable it for

00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:32.780
with Google Drive in it we enable it for
 

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:35.290
with Google Drive in it we enable it for
5% of users not everyone's on that build

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:35.300
5% of users not everyone's on that build
 

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:36.970
5% of users not everyone's on that build
yet so they're gonna upgrade over time

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:36.980
yet so they're gonna upgrade over time
 

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:39.070
yet so they're gonna upgrade over time
so actually in absolute numbers the 5%

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:39.080
so actually in absolute numbers the 5%
 

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:41.680
so actually in absolute numbers the 5%
grows right so keep that in mind that's

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:41.690
grows right so keep that in mind that's
 

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:42.820
grows right so keep that in mind that's
another interesting thing that we have

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:42.830
another interesting thing that we have
 

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:44.770
another interesting thing that we have
to deal with towards the end of the

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:44.780
to deal with towards the end of the
 

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:46.120
to deal with towards the end of the
rollout cycle we shifted from a

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:46.130
rollout cycle we shifted from a
 

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:47.590
rollout cycle we shifted from a
percentage roll out to a regional roll

00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:47.600
percentage roll out to a regional roll
 

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:49.000
percentage roll out to a regional roll
out Mike's gonna tell you why we did

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:49.010
out Mike's gonna tell you why we did
 

00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:51.610
out Mike's gonna tell you why we did
that and a little bit and of course just

00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:51.620
that and a little bit and of course just
 

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:53.350
that and a little bit and of course just
some you know critical things that we

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:53.360
some you know critical things that we
 

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:55.210
some you know critical things that we
did client monitoring was really

00:30:55.210 --> 00:30:55.220
did client monitoring was really
 

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:56.470
did client monitoring was really
important so we were constantly

00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:56.480
important so we were constantly
 

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.570
important so we were constantly
monitoring success rates for backups and

00:30:58.570 --> 00:30:58.580
monitoring success rates for backups and
 

00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:00.660
monitoring success rates for backups and
restores we were constantly monitoring

00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:00.670
restores we were constantly monitoring
 

00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:03.580
restores we were constantly monitoring
you know if a backup was failing what

00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:03.590
you know if a backup was failing what
 

00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:05.200
you know if a backup was failing what
type of error were we seeing and this

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:05.210
type of error were we seeing and this
 

00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:07.780
type of error were we seeing and this
led us find bugs and make optimizations

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:07.790
led us find bugs and make optimizations
 

00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:09.250
led us find bugs and make optimizations
along the way to make all of this more

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:09.260
along the way to make all of this more
 

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:11.680
along the way to make all of this more
reliable on Mike's side they were

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:11.690
reliable on Mike's side they were
 

00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:12.880
reliable on Mike's side they were
obviously doing a lot of server

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:12.890
obviously doing a lot of server
 

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:14.080
obviously doing a lot of server
monitoring to make sure we didn't bring

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:14.090
monitoring to make sure we didn't bring
 

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:16.630
monitoring to make sure we didn't bring
down Google servers which we mostly

00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:16.640
down Google servers which we mostly
 

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:19.570
down Google servers which we mostly
didn't and communication is key right so

00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:19.580
didn't and communication is key right so
 

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:21.130
didn't and communication is key right so
actually our teams communicated

00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:21.140
actually our teams communicated
 

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:22.990
actually our teams communicated
frequently every time there was a client

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:23.000
frequently every time there was a client
 

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.460
frequently every time there was a client
change that we thought would affect the

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:24.470
change that we thought would affect the
 

00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:25.900
change that we thought would affect the
way the server would respond we were

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:25.910
way the server would respond we were
 

00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:27.310
way the server would respond we were
communicated that and we still do that

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:27.320
communicated that and we still do that
 

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:30.730
communicated that and we still do that
today so communication really good when

00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:30.740
today so communication really good when
 

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:34.830
today so communication really good when
you're dealing with this type of thing

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:34.840
 

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:37.660
okay so let's let's take a look at what

00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:37.670
okay so let's let's take a look at what
 

00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:39.400
okay so let's let's take a look at what
the rollout actually looked like and it

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:39.410
the rollout actually looked like and it
 

00:31:39.410 --> 00:31:41.470
the rollout actually looked like and it
will speed things up here a little bit

00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:41.480
will speed things up here a little bit
 

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:43.720
will speed things up here a little bit
this is an actual graph of queries to

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:43.730
this is an actual graph of queries to
 

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:46.690
this is an actual graph of queries to
the drive API from whatsapp so you kind

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:46.700
the drive API from whatsapp so you kind
 

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:48.040
the drive API from whatsapp so you kind
of see on the Left we had our preview

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:48.050
of see on the Left we had our preview
 

00:31:48.050 --> 00:31:49.870
of see on the Left we had our preview
rollout where we're kind of testing

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:49.880
rollout where we're kind of testing
 

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.670
rollout where we're kind of testing
things out to see how how things are

00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:51.680
things out to see how how things are
 

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:53.370
things out to see how how things are
scaling everything was working great

00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:53.380
scaling everything was working great
 

00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:55.420
scaling everything was working great
from that were able to understand how

00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:55.430
from that were able to understand how
 

00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:56.530
from that were able to understand how
much provisioning we need so there's

00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:56.540
much provisioning we need so there's
 

00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:58.180
much provisioning we need so there's
kind of a quiet period while we allocate

00:31:58.180 --> 00:31:58.190
kind of a quiet period while we allocate
 

00:31:58.190 --> 00:32:00.250
kind of a quiet period while we allocate
the resources plan the rollout and then

00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:00.260
the resources plan the rollout and then
 

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:02.770
the resources plan the rollout and then
we start gradually bumping three bumping

00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:02.780
we start gradually bumping three bumping
 

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:04.420
we start gradually bumping three bumping
things up a couple of percent three

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:04.430
things up a couple of percent three
 

00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:06.670
things up a couple of percent three
percent at a time we wait for that and

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:06.680
percent at a time we wait for that and
 

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:08.680
percent at a time we wait for that and
we see how things behave then at some

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:08.690
we see how things behave then at some
 

00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:10.510
we see how things behave then at some
point we were ready to do daily rollouts

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:10.520
point we were ready to do daily rollouts
 

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:12.610
point we were ready to do daily rollouts
and that's a session in the middle not a

00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:12.620
and that's a session in the middle not a
 

00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:14.560
and that's a session in the middle not a
whole lot of sleeping right now during

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:14.570
whole lot of sleeping right now during
 

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:16.510
whole lot of sleeping right now during
this phase three percent a day until it

00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:16.520
this phase three percent a day until it
 

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:18.820
this phase three percent a day until it
was basically done there was an

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:18.830
was basically done there was an
 

00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:19.990
was basically done there was an
interesting point that we'll talk about

00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:20.000
interesting point that we'll talk about
 

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.550
interesting point that we'll talk about
here where we had to pause the rollout

00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:21.560
here where we had to pause the rollout
 

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:23.830
here where we had to pause the rollout
for for some reason for some regions

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:23.840
for for some reason for some regions
 

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:26.140
for for some reason for some regions
we'll take a look why and then after the

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:26.150
we'll take a look why and then after the
 

00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:27.790
we'll take a look why and then after the
New Year we resumed it and then towards

00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:27.800
New Year we resumed it and then towards
 

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:28.780
New Year we resumed it and then towards
the end we kind of had this natural

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:28.790
the end we kind of had this natural
 

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:33.490
the end we kind of had this natural
linear s growth at full roll

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:33.500
 

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:38.860
next slide so one quick look we for one

00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:38.870
next slide so one quick look we for one
 

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:40.480
next slide so one quick look we for one
of the more interesting things that

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:40.490
of the more interesting things that
 

00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:43.240
of the more interesting things that
happened in the rollout so data centers

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:43.250
happened in the rollout so data centers
 

00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:44.620
happened in the rollout so data centers
and services there are lots of data

00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:44.630
and services there are lots of data
 

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:46.210
and services there are lots of data
centers around the world they are not

00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:46.220
centers around the world they are not
 

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:48.640
centers around the world they are not
uniformly distributed and what that

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:48.650
uniformly distributed and what that
 

00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:51.460
uniformly distributed and what that
means is is that you have kind of local

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:51.470
means is is that you have kind of local
 

00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:53.290
means is is that you have kind of local
data centers where file uploads will go

00:32:53.290 --> 00:32:53.300
data centers where file uploads will go
 

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:55.750
data centers where file uploads will go
but also at Google and many places not

00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:55.760
but also at Google and many places not
 

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:57.700
but also at Google and many places not
all servers or services will run in

00:32:57.700 --> 00:32:57.710
all servers or services will run in
 

00:32:57.710 --> 00:32:59.980
all servers or services will run in
every data center seems like it's fine

00:32:59.980 --> 00:32:59.990
every data center seems like it's fine
 

00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:01.270
every data center seems like it's fine
you can you just bounce the traffic back

00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:01.280
you can you just bounce the traffic back
 

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:02.700
you can you just bounce the traffic back
and forth but it turns out to be

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:02.710
and forth but it turns out to be
 

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:04.900
and forth but it turns out to be
interesting in the in the following

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:04.910
interesting in the in the following
 

00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:08.230
interesting in the in the following
scenario so broadly speaking here you

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:08.240
scenario so broadly speaking here you
 

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:09.640
scenario so broadly speaking here you
know we have data centers on various

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:09.650
know we have data centers on various
 

00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:11.350
know we have data centers on various
continents there's a data center that

00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:11.360
continents there's a data center that
 

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:14.140
continents there's a data center that
accepts upload kind of in the west of

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:14.150
accepts upload kind of in the west of
 

00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:15.880
accepts upload kind of in the west of
the Pacific and there's a data center

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:15.890
the Pacific and there's a data center
 

00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:18.100
the Pacific and there's a data center
east of the Pacific that drive runs in

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:18.110
east of the Pacific that drive runs in
 

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:19.510
east of the Pacific that drive runs in
and particularly metadata storage layer

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:19.520
and particularly metadata storage layer
 

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:23.170
and particularly metadata storage layer
what was happening was we were uploading

00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:23.180
what was happening was we were uploading
 

00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:24.790
what was happening was we were uploading
the data into the local data center that

00:33:24.790 --> 00:33:24.800
the data into the local data center that
 

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.070
the data into the local data center that
was no it's great super low latency it

00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:27.080
was no it's great super low latency it
 

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:28.960
was no it's great super low latency it
was good post processing around

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:28.970
was good post processing around
 

00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:30.910
was good post processing around
checksums had to be done a drive because

00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:30.920
checksums had to be done a drive because
 

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:32.830
checksums had to be done a drive because
check sums are part of the metadata to

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:32.840
check sums are part of the metadata to
 

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:34.480
check sums are part of the metadata to
do that we needed to do calculated

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:34.490
do that we needed to do calculated
 

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:36.850
do that we needed to do calculated
checksum you need the file content drive

00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:36.860
checksum you need the file content drive
 

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:38.500
checksum you need the file content drive
did not run in the local data server

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:38.510
did not run in the local data server
 

00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:41.290
did not run in the local data server
that a data center rather that the file

upload service ran and so what was

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:43.280
upload service ran and so what was
 

00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:45.220
upload service ran and so what was
happening was Drive was pulling all of

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:45.230
happening was Drive was pulling all of
 

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:47.860
happening was Drive was pulling all of
the bytes across the Pacific from that

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:47.870
the bytes across the Pacific from that
 

00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:48.970
the bytes across the Pacific from that
data center I mean ultimately were

00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:48.980
data center I mean ultimately were
 

00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:50.710
data center I mean ultimately were
shipping bytes in a pipe right across an

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:50.720
shipping bytes in a pipe right across an
 

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:53.170
shipping bytes in a pipe right across an
ocean that pipe is very very much

00:33:53.170 --> 00:33:53.180
ocean that pipe is very very much
 

00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:54.940
ocean that pipe is very very much
limited it's expensive to use and if you

00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:54.950
limited it's expensive to use and if you
 

00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:56.830

saturate it things like YouTube could
 

00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:59.260
saturate it things like YouTube could
start to be impacted so we had to pause

00:33:59.260 --> 00:33:59.270
start to be impacted so we had to pause
 

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:01.540
start to be impacted so we had to pause
our rollout for the regions that were

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:01.550
our rollout for the regions that were
 

00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:05.800
our rollout for the regions that were
impacted and here is what we did the

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:05.810
impacted and here is what we did the
 

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:09.250
impacted and here is what we did the
solution to this was to what we pause

00:34:09.250 --> 00:34:09.260
solution to this was to what we pause
 

00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:11.760
solution to this was to what we pause
the rollout we moved the post processing

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:11.770
the rollout we moved the post processing
 

00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:14.170
the rollout we moved the post processing
and drive in particular the checksumming

00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:14.180
and drive in particular the checksumming
 

00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:16.570
and drive in particular the checksumming
into the same data centers associated

00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:16.580
into the same data centers associated
 

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:18.610
into the same data centers associated
with the regional uploads right so then

00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:18.620
with the regional uploads right so then
 

00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:20.050
with the regional uploads right so then
all the post processing was done we

00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:20.060
all the post processing was done we
 

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:21.580
all the post processing was done we
didn't have to transfer you know

00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:21.590
didn't have to transfer you know

forth and everybody was happy we were
 

00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:27.070
forth and everybody was happy we were
able to gradually resume the rollout

00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:27.080
able to gradually resume the rollout
 

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:29.530
able to gradually resume the rollout
that was that was a very interesting
