00:00:05.664 --> 00:00:06.580
SPEAKER: Hi, everyone.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.460
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.420
On behalf of [? Hola ?] LAX,
Google Talks At, and Latino

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.419
Heritage LA, I'd like
to welcome everyone

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:16.710
to our first Hispanic Heritage
Month event, where we're

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.410
going to have a panel
discussion, where we celebrate

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.440
the vibrancy of Latinidad or
the many different aspects that

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.850
make us Latino.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.550
Today, we will hear firsthand
from three very talented

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.922
local Latina artists,
each one of them

00:00:28.922 --> 00:00:30.630
providing their own
take on what it means

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.560
to be an artist in the US.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.070
I will start with
Sandra in the middle.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.350
Sandra Cornejo is a
first-generation Salvadoran

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.050
American artist born
in Houston, Texas.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.210
Historical collective
memory of post-civil war

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.730
Salvadoran culture is
an important influence

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.530
and inspiration for her work.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.200
She recently implemented a
portfolio preparation course

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.600
at Plaza de la Raza
for students aspiring

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.600
to continue their education
and profession in the arts.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.900
Sandra received a BFA from
VCU, with a concentration

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.550
in painting and printmaking.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.160
Recipient of the Ellen
Battell Stoeckel Fellowship,

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.980
she attended the Yale
Norfolk Summer Program.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:05.898
Thanks for being here.

00:01:05.898 --> 00:01:06.981
SANDRA CORNEJO: Thank you.

00:01:06.981 --> 00:01:07.760
Thanks for having me.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.010
SPEAKER: Then we have Yolanda
all the way to the left,

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.870
or to your right, was born
into a family whose artistic

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.720
heritage dates back to 1877.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.570
Gonzalez's travels in different
countries, the bonds forged

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.280
with individuals
in those places,

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.680
and the resulting
transformative experiences

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.290
are reflected in her
art and her life.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.290
She is known for her
strong, bold brush

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.970
strokes of color and
texture, intent on evoking

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.800
imagination and emotion.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.320
She was an artist in
residence in Ginza, Japan,

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.167
followed by a similar
stint in Assisi, Italy.

00:01:37.167 --> 00:01:39.750
Throughout the years, Gonzalez
has taught at various community

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.740
organizations.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.110
You can see some of her
work on the gold line trains

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.590
as well as buses throughout LA
in a collaboration with AARP.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.232
Yolanda studied at the Pasadena
Art Center College of Design

00:01:50.232 --> 00:01:52.440
after winning a painting
competition that awarded her

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.630
a scholarship to the
prestigious school.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.180
Thanks again.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.890
YOLANDA GONZALEZ:
Thanks for having me.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.000
SPEAKER: Of course.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.300
And now we have Rosalie Lopez,
a Los Angeles-based artist

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.700
whose work involves combining
cultural iconography

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.190
with references of her
everyday surroundings.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.320
At a young age, she
was heavily impacted

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.600
with the realities of loss,
addictions, and violence

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.310
within her immediate
family, which

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.230
continue to shape her
perspectives in society

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.310
and culture.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.820
She primarily uses printmaking,
papel picado, installation,

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.950
and the altar offering
to relay experiences

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.090
of survival, loss, and pride.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.820
Rosalie earned a
master of fine arts

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.700
in printmaking from Indiana
University and dual bachelor

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.440
of fine arts degrees
in graphic design

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.980
and printmaking from California
State University, Long Beach.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.570
All three women have
had their artwork

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.790
exhibited in many museums
around the country

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:36.760
and internationally.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.882
So let's give them
a warm welcome.

00:02:38.882 --> 00:02:40.325
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:40.325 --> 00:02:41.645
ROSALIE LOPEZ: Thank you.

00:02:41.645 --> 00:02:43.270
SPEAKER: Welcome to
the Google Familia.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.810
This is very exciting.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.085
ROSALIE LOPEZ: Happy to be here.

00:02:45.085 --> 00:02:46.751
SPEAKER: Super-exciting
to do, you know,

00:02:46.751 --> 00:02:48.790
Hispanic Heritage
Month, first event.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:49.970
And we have you.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.810
Yay.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.970
So I'm super, super-excited
to not only have you here.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.530
But also, your artwork.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.930
If you haven't seen the
fabulous display of artwork

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.750
that we have here and the
collection in the boardwalk--

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.940
some people are like,
what is the boardwalk?

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.234
In front of the barista,
outside of Big Lebowski,

00:03:06.234 --> 00:03:07.150
that is our boardwalk.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.970
That's where we have six
different artists displayed.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.500
And three of them
are right here.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.550
So I'd love to know.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.500
So there was probably
a thought process,

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.340
which artwork bring to Google?

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.440
Was that hard?

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.390
We have six, four, one.

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.120
Sandra, you
specifically chose one.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.300
Yolanda, like six.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.070
Rosalie chose four.

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.710
I'm very interested, like
the behind-the-scenes look

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.490
at why these pieces and what
the selection process was.

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.830
So just so everybody knows,
if we go to one slide,

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.260
this is Yolanda's work.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.500
Yolanda, tell us about this.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.458
Why did you choose these
very particular pieces

00:03:41.458 --> 00:03:43.070
to have here with us today?

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.390
YOLANDA GONZALEZ: Well, I
wanted to exhibit something

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.670
contemporary, something that
was representational of my work

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.930
that was more recent that
had all of the texture

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.060
that I usually
use, the color that

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.390
is known for the Chicano art.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.420
And I wanted to send
some of the works

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.070
that I'm most excited about--

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.510
SPEAKER: Oh, very nice.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:07.750
YOLANDA GONZALEZ: --which
are some still lifes

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:08.596
and some portraits.

00:04:08.596 --> 00:04:09.970
And these are
portraits of people

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:15.880
that I know that are dear to me,
that represent strength, power,

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.819
positive energy, and love.

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:18.610
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:19.779
And now that we're
in the subject,

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:21.237
I noticed that two
of the paintings

00:04:21.237 --> 00:04:22.725
are called Diana something.

00:04:22.725 --> 00:04:24.490
Who is this Diana person?

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.170
YOLANDA GONZALEZ:
Well, Diana Galicia

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.610
is a very dear friend of mine.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:34.710
And her husband is an
incredible jewelry maestro.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.580
So this is Diana's husband.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.710
This is all of the
work that he creates.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.970
And we've known each
other for about 25 years.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.040
And she's just a
brilliant woman.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.785
Brilliant, powerful woman.

00:04:46.785 --> 00:04:47.410
SPEAKER: Great.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:48.100
That's so nice.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.750
Do they have this artwork
in their homes as well?

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:51.160
YOLANDA GONZALEZ: They do.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.810
They have some.

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.791
They have a house in Tulum.

00:04:53.791 --> 00:04:55.540
And they've taken some
portraits that I've

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.790
created of them to their home.

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:58.190
SPEAKER: That's wonderful.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.690
Thank you.

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:59.890
Thank you so much.

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:04.190
And then on the next page,
we have Rosalie's work.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.400
Rosalie, you have four
different pieces here

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.290
with papel picado
and different things.

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.925
Tell us, why these
specific pieces?

00:05:10.925 --> 00:05:13.300
ROSALIE LOPEZ: Kind of going
off what Yolanda was saying,

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.460
I wanted to pick
work that exemplified

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.950
what I'm creating right now.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.640
As a printmaker and
someone who combines

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.390
that with papel picado,
I wanted to choose

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:26.560
works that talk about
the ofrenda and offering

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:32.050
in a very contemporary way, in
untraditional somewhat ways.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.580
So I have a papel picado
piece of an LA scene, a family

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.690
portrait that I combine
with LED lights and a couple

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.100
other ofrenda pieces that
are all papel picado.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.080
So I felt like
together, they make

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.620
a grouping that really talks
about the things that I feel

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.704
embody the concepts
that I work with.

00:05:52.704 --> 00:05:53.620
SPEAKER: That's great.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:54.510
Thank you.

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.380
Yeah.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.280
So you do these and
also tons of other?

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.155
Because you combine--

00:05:59.155 --> 00:06:01.240
ROSALIE LOPEZ: I do
installation art.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.630
Sometimes, it's just pure
printmaking mixed together

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.040
sometimes with papel picado.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.100
So I really enjoy creating--

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.500
transforming spaces to
give people an experience.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.380
So sometimes, that means
breaking out of the frame

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.290
and inhabiting a space.

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:17.601
SPEAKER: Nice.

00:06:17.601 --> 00:06:18.100
Thank you.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.232
That's great.

00:06:19.232 --> 00:06:20.940
And now we're going
to see Sandra's work.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.480
And Sandra's very specific.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.874
You have this big, huge artwork.

00:06:24.874 --> 00:06:26.290
SANDRA CORNEJO: I
chose one piece.

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:26.831
SPEAKER: One.

00:06:26.831 --> 00:06:28.567
I'm very curious, why one?

00:06:28.567 --> 00:06:29.650
SANDRA CORNEJO: One piece.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.670
Well, it's a group of work
that I'm currently working on.

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.490
I tend to work in series.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:41.890
So at the moment, I'm exploring
notions of childhood, memory,

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:46.280
nostalgia, like what drives
that nostalgic power.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.145
And this image is--

00:06:48.145 --> 00:06:50.380
is it something that's
been romanticized?

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.210
Something that's been skewed?

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.624
Like why?

00:06:54.624 --> 00:06:55.790
Why does it have that power?

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:59.050
So I love kind of
asking these questions

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:00.440
as I'm making the work.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.910
So as you see this piece,
it's representational,

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:06.590
yet has very abstract
elements to it.

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:11.350
So kind of like a push and pull,
like an inquiry of my past,

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:13.240
like where I come from.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.420
So it's a very
tender, loving memory.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:20.590
It's a bit like discombobulated
and may make sense.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:25.080
And it might bring truth to
some of my viewers, I hope.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.320
SPEAKER: No, I loved it.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.464
All the work is beautiful.

00:07:27.464 --> 00:07:28.880
And I thought it
was very powerful

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.490
that you just chose one.

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:31.480
SANDRA CORNEJO: Yeah.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.688
SPEAKER: I need to know more.

00:07:32.688 --> 00:07:36.910
[LAUGHS] So I like
to know also--

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:39.400
so you were talking about
themes and how right now,

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.802
you're working on this
theme of childhood.

00:07:41.802 --> 00:07:42.720
What drives a theme?

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.580
Like For all three
of you, when you

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:47.670
work on a theme, what is
that driver or that influence

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:49.620
to go on that theme?

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.455
How do you choose the
theme that is next?

00:07:51.455 --> 00:07:52.830
SANDRA CORNEJO:
Well, there tends

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:55.800
to be themes that I've been
working with for a really

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.950
long time, whether
it's commemorating

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:01.290
a figure, like in
a monolithic space,

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:02.670
like one figure in a space.

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:03.390
Like why?

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:05.040
Like telling a story.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.470
Always very narrative-like.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:11.340
So childhood, social
justice, where I'm from--

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.210
El Salvador.

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:13.540
Like, it's history.

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:16.480
So it's very historically-based.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.960
And I'm always seeking
out a narrative.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.360
And whatever that
narrative may be,

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.080
that's the image that surfaces.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.360
SPEAKER: Great.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.619
How does it work
for both of you?

00:08:28.619 --> 00:08:30.160
YOLANDA GONZALEZ:
I think for myself,

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.200
it's something
that's very personal.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:36.120
And I try to cover
narratives that

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:41.549
are what people are going
through along with myself.

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:46.170
And that reality and how that
reality is portrayed on canvas

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:49.505
in a beautiful manner.

00:08:49.505 --> 00:08:50.460
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:51.835
ROSALIE LOPEZ: In
my case, I feel

00:08:51.835 --> 00:08:57.030
like I'm very much inspired by
my community, my neighborhood.

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:59.280
And in the beginning,
a lot of my work

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.040
was definitely influenced
by Dia de los Muertos altars

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.370
and how women would use
these altars as a platform

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.620
to discuss social
issues in the community

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:11.160
as a way to have a voice and
gathering assemblage work.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.855
And so from that, and
using my own experiences,

00:09:15.855 --> 00:09:21.750
I use it as a way to talk about
people who I want to praise

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:25.590
or I want to commemorate
and how we can take pride

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:27.870
in our communal
histories and stories

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:30.400
and display them as something
to be very proud about.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.080
SPEAKER: Nice.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.640
Do you feel that--

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.600
so of course, artwork
is your emotion.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.450
There's a voice behind it.

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:42.000
Do you feel there's a voice or
an emotion that you tap into,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.620
and when you do,
better work comes out?

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:45.130
What it is?

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:47.671
Some people are like, I need
to be depressed or [INAUDIBLE]..

00:09:47.671 --> 00:09:49.020
I don't know.

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.270
I'm not an artist like
this, to this magnitude.

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:54.620
I do little things for
my children, but not--

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.180
or certainly like in school.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.400
Tell me, how does that work
for you in that process?

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.460
SANDRA CORNEJO: No,
definitely, like for me

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:04.540
in my works, the struggle.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:11.700
Like, a struggle, any struggle,
perseverance, overcoming,

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:16.080
beauty, like all of these
very strong elements

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.850
that just run through all of
my work is what drives it.

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:24.080
Like, absolutely.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:28.910
ROSALIE LOPEZ: I definitely feel
like in my case, the materials

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:33.050
that I use and the person
that I'm dedicating it to

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:34.280
are things that I harness.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:37.310
And I want that energy
to transmute and infuse

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:39.050
into the artwork.

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:41.300
So I pull on a lot
of those emotions.

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:43.190
Most of the people I
use are people that I'm

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:44.231
connected to in some way.

00:10:44.231 --> 00:10:46.190
So I have a
relationship with them.

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:49.310
And if I'm commemorating
a past memory

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:53.000
or igniting thoughts
from other viewers in it,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.490
I want them to
cherish those things

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:59.677
and to have value so
that they don't forget.

00:10:59.677 --> 00:11:00.260
SPEAKER: Nice.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:00.920
OK.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.586
YOLANDA GONZALEZ: I
think my inspiration

00:11:02.586 --> 00:11:04.850
is people, the
relationships that we have,

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:09.145
and the emotions that they evoke
in my soul and in my heart.

00:11:09.145 --> 00:11:10.520
So when there's
somebody that I'm

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.430
passionate about that I'm
creating a portrait of,

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:15.249
you definitely see
it on the canvas.

00:11:15.249 --> 00:11:16.040
SPEAKER: Of course.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.248
YOLANDA GONZALEZ: Absolutely.

00:11:17.248 --> 00:11:18.427
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:11:18.427 --> 00:11:20.510
So it's that emotion that
we're discussing, right?

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:20.860
YOLANDA GONZALEZ: Yes.

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:22.210
SPEAKER: So when
you're doing people--

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:24.335
I mean, it's people you're
passionate about or very

00:11:24.335 --> 00:11:26.194
excited to evoke.

00:11:26.194 --> 00:11:27.860
Is it just all pure
happiness, or do you

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:30.584
have like inner emotions
that are coming out

00:11:30.584 --> 00:11:32.500
in this painting, too,
that you're trying to--

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.517
I mean, like there's
always subliminal messages.

00:11:34.517 --> 00:11:35.350
Do you do that, too?

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:36.725
YOLANDA GONZALEZ:
I think there's

00:11:36.725 --> 00:11:38.690
all kinds of emotions
that transpire

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:40.190
in the creative process.

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:44.060
And it's that relationship
between your canvas.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.100
And since I've been
painting for 30 years,

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:47.677
it's a love relationship.

00:11:47.677 --> 00:11:48.260
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.510
YOLANDA GONZALEZ: And it's
this medium that feeds my soul.

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:54.330
And then, there's
this other person.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:57.230
So it's a dialogue
between the three of us.

00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:00.230
Between the creative
process the canvas, myself,

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:03.440
and the sitter, the
portrait I'm creating of.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.380
And so definitely,
there's different emotions

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:07.060
that come out.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:11.300
And it's lovely to
allow yourself to convey

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:12.757
that with the brushstrokes.

00:12:12.757 --> 00:12:13.340
SPEAKER: Sure.

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:14.548
YOLANDA GONZALEZ: Definitely.

00:12:14.548 --> 00:12:15.050
Yeah.

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:15.758
SPEAKER: Tell me.

00:12:15.758 --> 00:12:16.410
Tell me.

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:17.000
ROSALIE LOPEZ: I was
just going to say,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.755
it's like a form
of communicating.

00:12:18.755 --> 00:12:20.750
Instead of using words,
you can say it best

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:23.120
with images and textures.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.586
And as those things layer,
it creates the emotion

00:12:25.586 --> 00:12:26.960
that you're not
quite able to put

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.380
into the same sort of wording.

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:30.529
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:12:30.529 --> 00:12:32.570
ROSALIE LOPEZ: You hope
that people get that when

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:34.880
they see it, or it allows
them to see something

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.830
in a different
way, because that's

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:39.170
how you find your mode of
communication happening best.

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:40.067
SPEAKER: Sure.

00:12:40.067 --> 00:12:42.650
So it's like for the next Google
Talk, we'll just have easels.

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:43.962
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:43.962 --> 00:12:45.170
YOLANDA GONZALEZ: Absolutely.

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:47.010
Great idea.

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:48.610
Let's do it.

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:51.821
SPEAKER: So I'm very proud to
be amongst all these Latinas,

00:12:51.821 --> 00:12:52.320
right?

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:52.975
It's wonderful.

00:12:52.975 --> 00:12:54.350
And I'm thinking,
how hard is it?

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:57.130
I mean, a Latina, a
woman, basically, you're

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:58.370
an entrepreneur.

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:02.690
How hard is it in the art world
to be a Latina and a woman

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:05.730
in a business that's--

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:07.550
there's a lot of men in it, too.

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:08.120
Tell me.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.370
I want to know.

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:12.170
YOLANDA GONZALEZ:
There are obstacles.

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:13.820
I tend to not focus on them.

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:17.840
I just continue to forge
forward and to continue

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.900
to be focused on what I'm doing
in business and my creativity.

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:24.517
So there's Yolanda Gonzalez,
who is the artist, the creative.

00:13:24.517 --> 00:13:26.600
And there is Yolanda
Gonzalez, the businessperson.

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.430
And that was taught to me by
my dad, Leopoldo Gonzalez,

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:31.910
who was a great businessman.

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:36.380
So I think if you can separate
yourself from the creative,

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:40.899
and then to the business
of this beautiful painting

00:13:40.899 --> 00:13:43.190
that you're going to hand
over, that your soul is going

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:44.690
to hang in somebody's home.

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:46.920
I think it's important
to focus on that.

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.220
So there are
obstacles, but I think

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:55.910
like in any other line
of work, I just focus on

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:58.980
a clear, straight,
and narrow road.

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.424
And that's to my goal.

00:14:01.424 --> 00:14:03.090
ROSALIE LOPEZ: It's
the Latino backbone.

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:06.450
We have parents and family
who teach us how to work hard,

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:12.080
who show us what it's like to
have dedication into something.

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:15.200
And I feel like I definitely
pull from that, too.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.139
My mom, single parent mom.

00:14:17.139 --> 00:14:18.680
And what she did to
make things work.

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.870
And you use that,
transmute that into what

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:22.830
goals you want to accomplish.

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:24.477
And it comes through.

00:14:24.477 --> 00:14:26.060
You could tell
people's drive, and you

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:28.070
could see it
because they learned

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:29.351
from people before them.

00:14:29.351 --> 00:14:31.350
Not even in the same field
or a different thing,

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:33.176
but they see it being
applied, and then it

00:14:33.176 --> 00:14:35.300
trickles down into your
own personality and the way

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.897
that you work.

00:14:37.897 --> 00:14:38.480
SPEAKER: Sure.

00:14:40.252 --> 00:14:42.710
ROSALIE LOPEZ: I think that
there is definitely a struggle.

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:45.050
Being an artist is not easy.

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:47.540
I wanted Yolanda to
answer first because she's

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:49.990
got a lot more experience
than Sandra and I.

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:51.960
We're newer in
this sort of game.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:55.730
So I feel like I learned
from women like her

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:59.480
that their strength
and their passageways,

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.480
them pioneering
these paths for us,

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.600
make it a different world for
us than it was, I think, even

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.740
in their timeframe.

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:08.330
So I acknowledge that.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:10.670
I really feel like
they are people

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:14.100
that I like to look up
to and I learn from.

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:15.010
I'm a teacher, too.

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:17.420
So I feel like as an instructor,
as a teacher, sometimes

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:19.878
the students don't think like,
oh, where is the teacher at?

00:15:19.878 --> 00:15:20.930
Oh, that's me.

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:23.059
I'm right here.

00:15:23.059 --> 00:15:24.850
I appreciate her boldness
and her strength.

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:26.200
And I think that's
something that I really

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.250
admire about Yolanda.

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:27.760
YOLANDA GONZALEZ: Thank you.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.593
ROSALIE LOPEZ: It comes
through in her work.

00:15:29.593 --> 00:15:34.840
And I feel like I'm
coming to my own in that.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.360
I'm finding that
voice and I'm figuring

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.610
how that communicates
with my surroundings

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:41.200
and my neighborhood.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:46.780
I feel like I can be a venue
for communicating these things.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.270
How I am impacted
by them and how

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:51.880
other people see this
happening in our communities.

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.340
So we play an important
role in showing people

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:58.510
that it's not the same route
to understanding what's

00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:01.580
happening in our culture
and our neighborhood.

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:06.070
And I feel thankful to be
a part of events like this

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:10.000
because it's not a voice
that's commonly heard.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.520
It's not a voice where
we often get a platform

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:14.990
to be such a strong voice.

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:17.650
So I appreciate being
involved with it

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:20.469
and being involved with
artists like these.

00:16:20.469 --> 00:16:21.260
SPEAKER: Of course.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:21.926
Are you kidding?

00:16:21.926 --> 00:16:22.850
You're always welcome.

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:23.940
Yeah.

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.440
YOLANDA GONZALEZ: I'd like to
say thank you for saying that.

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:27.820
I appreciate it.

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:34.390
And I've worked hard to keep
my reputation and my persona

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:37.440
kind of a certain way for you.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.259
ROSALIE LOPEZ: The
aura comes through.

00:16:39.259 --> 00:16:40.050
SPEAKER: I love it.

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:41.800
YOLANDA GONZALEZ:
I never had kids.

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:45.310
I never had kids, but I
felt when I would go places,

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:48.370
I always tell my friends,
we're representing.

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:49.300
We are representing.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:50.500
We're responsible.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:53.950
Wherever we are, we are
responsible to hold up

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:56.530
who we are and
our whole culture.

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:59.530
Whether we're the only
Chicana in the room

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:03.929
at a function in a very astute
place, we're representing.

00:17:03.929 --> 00:17:04.720
SPEAKER: Of course.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:05.140
YOLANDA GONZALEZ:
It doesn't matter

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:08.380
if you're in the restroom or
if you're in the dining room,

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:09.490
people watch.

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:11.920
And you have to represent
who your culture is.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.339
SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:14.618
YOLANDA GONZALEZ: Very-- yeah.

00:17:14.618 --> 00:17:16.780
SANDRA CORNEJO: And Los
Angeles, just in general--

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:19.900
like I've moved around a
bit, and I've experienced

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:22.599
different art communities.

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:26.619
But having arrived
here three years ago,

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:31.270
I found an art community here
that was just very inviting,

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:32.140
very giving.

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:36.790
Like finding these strongholds,
like these beautiful, powerful

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:39.880
women, like Chicana art is--

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.620
that'll give you--

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:45.490
I'm Salvadoran, but I
met this amazing artist,

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:47.470
Margaret Garcia, when
I first moved here.

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:49.600
And she's like, honey.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.710
We're all the same here.

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:54.550
Within like a week of
me having meeting her,

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:58.240
like she already had me kind of
like meeting different people

00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.680
and into exhibitions.

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:02.530
And it's just like
everyone here is like down

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:05.410
to help each other out, which is
something that you don't really

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:07.920
find in a lot of places.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:11.860
It's a lot of power here within
the art community and Chicanas,

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:13.060
Latinas in general.

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:14.643
SPEAKER: So are you
paying it forward?

00:18:14.643 --> 00:18:16.420
You were saying, you
always have a voice.

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:17.950
People are always watching.

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:18.757
Do you mentor?

00:18:18.757 --> 00:18:20.090
Tell us a little bit about that.

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:21.865
Like what do you do to--

00:18:21.865 --> 00:18:25.830
so to give to the
next generation?

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:26.890
[INAUDIBLE] you teach?

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:29.800
ROSALIE LOPEZ: Right
now, I love teaching.

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.255
I teach right now at two
Cal State Universities,

00:18:32.255 --> 00:18:34.750
at Cal State, Long Beach,
and Cal State, Northridge

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:36.250
and also at Cerritos College.

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:41.442
So teaching art, I feel like
some of my biggest mentors

00:18:41.442 --> 00:18:43.900
that I have, a lot of them were
professors and some of them

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:46.520
were working artists
outside of the institution.

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:52.000
I try to think about how I can
bring that communal experience

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.582
and working with artists
outside of the institution

00:18:54.582 --> 00:18:57.040
and think about how you can
bring that into the institution

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.020
and work with
students and get them

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:01.870
to clarify their own voices.

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:04.480
You're teaching them how to
use a medium and then also, how

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.730
to speak through that medium.

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:09.100
So it's an interesting thing.

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:10.600
I think that helps
to pay it back.

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:14.830
I think I'm really happy to
also work at the community level

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:17.200
with places like Plaza
de la Raza, where

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:21.020
I get to work with youth and
those young kids that just love

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:22.840
working with art.

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.980
It's not even always
about the end product.

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:27.022
It's about the process of
working and having fun.

00:19:27.022 --> 00:19:28.771
SANDRA CORNEJO: It's
the experience, yeah.

00:19:28.771 --> 00:19:30.940
ROSALIE LOPEZ: Those
experiences coming together

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:32.840
are what makes it a lot of fun.

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.025
So yeah.

00:19:34.025 --> 00:19:35.680
SPEAKER: Of course.

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:36.640
Anything over there?

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:37.720
I have more questions.

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:38.678
YOLANDA GONZALEZ: Yeah.

00:19:38.678 --> 00:19:42.130
I think it's
important to mentor.

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:44.770
I've taught several places
throughout the 30 years

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:46.260
that I've been creating art.

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:50.340
I worked for Plaza
de la Raza teaching

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:55.300
and for Para Los Ninos for
inner city arts for 14 years.

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.910
And it was amazing to
work with the youth

00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:02.290
and just to teach them
art but to also teach them

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:05.830
acceptance of who they are.

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:09.205
Right now, I work
with [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:09.205 --> 00:20:13.720
teaching senior citizens
watercolor and ceramics.

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.134
SPEAKER: Hence, your AARP?

00:20:15.134 --> 00:20:16.050
YOLANDA GONZALEZ: Yes.

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:18.530
And they're absolutely lovely.

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:19.690
SPEAKER: That's nice.

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:21.940
And so you were here recently.

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:23.680
You're saying three
years ago, right?

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.360
SANDRA CORNEJO: Yeah.

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.130
SPEAKER: So they've
embraced you.

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:30.250
And now, is it too
early to give back?

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:33.730
What are you thinking about in
terms of the next generation?

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:34.730
SANDRA CORNEJO: Oh, man.

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:40.060
I'm excited to be working
with Plaza de La Raza.

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:43.240
I noticed that while I was
working for Margaret Garcia--

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:46.180
and I also worked for Frank
Romero, another artist

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:47.950
in the community--

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:51.080
I would assist them within their
classes at Plaza de la Raza.

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.680
And I realized that
there was really

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:57.010
nothing being offered for
the next generation that's

00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:59.080
trying to move
forward and kind of

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.690
like hone in on their skills,
what they're really trying

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:03.500
to say and express,
and just like start

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:07.030
developing their own style,
their own voice through art.

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:10.960
So I proposed a portfolio
preparation course at Plaza.

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:13.690
And we're entering the
fourth semester now.

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:16.600
So I'm pretty excited about it.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:20.410
We have many beautiful,
very talented artists.

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:24.250
And just giving them a space
to really think about the work

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:27.909
that they're making and have
them develop their style,

00:21:27.909 --> 00:21:29.950
that was something that
was very important for me

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:33.417
as a kid in high school,
like having that teacher that

00:21:33.417 --> 00:21:35.500
will just kind of will
give you the space and room

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.650
to do what you need to do.

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:40.780
And you know, just like
beginning dialogue,

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:43.180
having conversations
about your work.

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:45.580
There's more to it than just
a beautiful image, you know?

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.370
SPEAKER: Of course.

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:51.805
SANDRA CORNEJO: I already feel
like I'm giving into that.

00:21:51.805 --> 00:21:52.840
I'm feeding it.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.270
And it's feeding me as well.

00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:58.266
It's definitely like a
reciprocal relationship.

00:21:58.266 --> 00:21:59.140
SPEAKER: That's nice.

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:01.120
Love it.

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.290
I mean, as an artist.

00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:05.980
I mean, your surroundings
shape you and influence

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:08.624
you and the people you meet and
all the travels that you do.

00:22:08.624 --> 00:22:09.790
I mean, you've moved around.

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:10.456
You've traveled.

00:22:10.456 --> 00:22:14.320
You've even done work in Assisi.

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.810
You've had a ton of things
also in the community.

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:20.200
There's a lot that goes on.

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.200
In my mind, can you think
of an anecdote, or a story,

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:26.740
or like one example that truly
shows when a piece of art

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:28.270
really made an impact?

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:30.610
Is there like the one?

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:32.740
Or is it like, no, all
the time, or everything?

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:33.930
I don't know.

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:35.260
Tell me, when and why?

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:38.032
What made that impact?

00:22:38.032 --> 00:22:39.240
ROSALIE LOPEZ: I got a story.

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.823
SANDRA CORNEJO: Yeah,
you got a story?

00:22:40.823 --> 00:22:43.234
SPEAKER: I love it.

00:22:43.234 --> 00:22:44.650
ROSALIE LOPEZ:
I've had this idea.

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:47.620
I make a lot of altars
and a lot of offerings.

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:49.760
So I've had this
idea for a long time.

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:51.880
And I was happy to
be able to do it.

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:54.080
Finally, like I think
three years into having it,

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.270
it was in my sketchbook.

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:56.480
I finally get to do it.

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:59.180
And got grant money to do it.

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:03.070
But I've always wanted to do
this pop-up altar installation

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:05.080
dedicated to my mom.

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:08.350
My mom, when she passed away,
we inherited all of her plants.

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:11.194
And so my sister and I started
taking care of her plants

00:23:11.194 --> 00:23:13.360
and learning how to have
this green thumb because we

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:16.630
wanted to preserve her
through these plants.

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:18.370
And so I've been sprouting them.

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:20.110
And my sister and I
were living together,

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:21.610
and then we were
going to part ways.

00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:23.360
She was going to get
a job somewhere else.

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:26.600
And the thought of not having
her plants was like, oh,

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:27.100
don't worry.

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:28.570
I'm going to clone them.

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:31.450
We can each have-- so
I cloned all the plants

00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:33.790
and I started
getting into cloning.

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:37.390
I wanted to make a pop-up altar
where people shared stories

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:38.689
of their mothers with me.

00:23:38.689 --> 00:23:41.230
And in exchange, I would give
them a sprouting plant from one

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:42.640
of my mom's plants.

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:45.730
So I wanted to gather and
archive all these stories

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:47.931
and post them up on social
media and on my website

00:23:47.931 --> 00:23:49.930
so that people can listen
to these great stories

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:53.570
that they told and they shared
about women in their lives.

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:57.430
So this past Mother's Day,
the day before Mother's Day,

00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:59.920
I was able to set up a little
pop-up on the LA river bed.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:03.350
And I got a chance to do
it, sit at this huge altar

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:06.040
of beautiful, green
plants and just

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.190
seeing them sort of
perky and happy there--

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:09.690
the plants, that is.

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:12.160
I was like, this
is for you, Mom.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.810
And then also,
hearing everyone's

00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:15.820
stories of how
women in their lives

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:19.752
brought so much strength
and the amazing things

00:24:19.752 --> 00:24:20.710
that people remembered.

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:23.740
And also, their connection to
this living thing-- a plant.

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:25.820
What that meant to
a lot of people.

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:28.930
And those stories that I
heard, it was like a constant--

00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:31.890
I felt like that was giving
back because those memories stay

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:33.390
with people for the
rest of the day.

00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:33.750
SPEAKER: Of course.

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:35.416
ROSALIE LOPEZ: They
remember that memory

00:24:35.416 --> 00:24:39.002
about grandma or about auntie,
and it stays with them.

00:24:39.002 --> 00:24:40.960
And I thought, man, I
almost forgot about that.

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.876
And it was because of
that moment, that event,

00:24:42.876 --> 00:24:44.320
that they got to remember.

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.180
And that's what was
really important for me.

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:49.284
I felt like that
was my anecdote.

00:24:49.284 --> 00:24:50.450
SPEAKER: That was beautiful.

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:50.900
ROSALIE LOPEZ: Thank you.

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:51.610
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:52.960
Are you going to do it again?

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:53.860
ROSALIE LOPEZ: Oh, I'd love to.

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:56.026
I've always wanted to do
this, like in a flea market

00:24:56.026 --> 00:24:59.650
or swap meet, and have a
different sort of crowd

00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:01.930
and then grow that
archive and just

00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:04.162
continue adding stories
and adding stories to it.

00:25:04.162 --> 00:25:05.620
SPEAKER: Now you
can add all of us.

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:08.660
We can join you.

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:10.010
Sandra, you had a story as well.

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:11.468
SANDRA CORNEJO:
Oh, you could tell?

00:25:11.468 --> 00:25:12.110
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:14.410
SANDRA CORNEJO: I got one.

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:17.020
So when I recently
moved here-- this

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:19.914
is why I think it's just
like when I moved here,

00:25:19.914 --> 00:25:21.580
all the stars were
just like telling me,

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:24.970
like you're at the right
place at the right time.

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:29.896
When I had just moved here, I
remember I was in Home Depot,

00:25:29.896 --> 00:25:31.145
and I was like walking around.

00:25:31.145 --> 00:25:33.700
I was like, well, I need
a plant for my new home,

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:35.350
like, looking around.

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:38.310
And then I get an
unknown phone call.

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:41.300
And when I pick up,
Maria [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:43.720
is on the other line, at
the other end of the line.

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:46.360
And I'm not sure if you
guys are familiar with her,

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:50.120
but she was a very prominent
social justice figure

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:53.650
here in Los Angeles,
had survived

00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:57.520
through many, many
things in El Salvador

00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:02.320
and resettled in the United
States during the '80s.

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.720
So since the '80s,
she's been organizing

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.910
with so many different groups.

00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:08.800
She heard about the
type of work that I

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:14.080
was doing, which is all based
on historical collective memory,

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:17.170
like stories from the
Salvadoran Civil War.

00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:19.870
And she said to me like,
I'd love to meet you.

00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:22.450
And you know, I'd
love to talk to you.

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:26.469
I'd love to have you paint
me, like have a sitting.

00:26:26.469 --> 00:26:27.010
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:29.384
SANDRA CORNEJO: So we talked
about getting that together.

00:26:29.384 --> 00:26:32.320
And I worked with
her for about a year.

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.810
And walked away
from the experience

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:36.850
with two really
beautiful paintings.

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:39.010
But throughout that
time span, like

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:41.800
she shared her stories with me.

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:44.110
We would go out for pupusas.

00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:46.840
It's just a lot of
beautiful experiences.

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:51.610
But she also sat me down
to watch a documentary that

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:53.140
was done for her.

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:57.820
So we sat in a room,
held hands sometimes

00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:02.200
because it was just like-- the
story was just really intense.

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:06.490
But she explained to me, maybe
midway of having spent time

00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:09.070
with her, that she had cancer.

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:10.780
It had come back.

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:13.730
And she had a certain
amount of time to live.

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:17.410
So just having the
opportunity to sit with her

00:27:17.410 --> 00:27:20.980
and paint her and
share her story

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:23.830
and exhibit it in
different spaces

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:27.160
brought so many people
together from different parts

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:32.440
of her life that would recognize
that person in the painting.

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:37.930
I walked up to one person,
a patron of mine actually,

00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:41.350
and she was crying when she
was seeing the painting.

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:45.040
And she shared with me-- like
once Maria had already passed,

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:47.847
she had shared the stories
that they shared together, like

00:27:47.847 --> 00:27:48.680
through [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:53.710
And so I feel like it was just
a very organic and natural thing

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:55.150
that just happened.

00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:58.120
And I feel fortunate to have
been able to document that

00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:03.219
and to just produce something
that keeps her memory living.

00:28:03.219 --> 00:28:04.510
SPEAKER: That's pretty magical.

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:05.385
SANDRA CORNEJO: Yeah.

00:28:05.385 --> 00:28:08.050
I'd love to show you
guys the images now.

00:28:08.050 --> 00:28:13.600
But her story was
definitely about survival.

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:14.600
There's a beauty to it.

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.770
But there was also a
lot of darkness to it.

00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:19.839
So I think yeah, it
was just very powerful.

00:28:19.839 --> 00:28:21.130
SPEAKER: Thank you for sharing.

00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:22.213
SANDRA CORNEJO: Of course.

00:28:22.213 --> 00:28:24.002
Thank you.

00:28:24.002 --> 00:28:24.710
SPEAKER: Yolanda.

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:28.710
In all your experience,
tell me one, maybe?

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:29.370
I don't know.

00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:29.980
Can you?

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:30.950
Can you reduce it?

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:31.566
I don't know.

00:28:31.566 --> 00:28:33.550
YOLANDA GONZALEZ: Yeah,
I could reduce it.

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:35.500
I think one that is very recent.

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:38.860
I was recently
commissioned by [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:44.710
to create a sculpture for
one of their facilities.

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:50.140
And I have been creating
ceramics for about 20 years.

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:54.250
And there are these women that I
make that are called [SPANISH]..

00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:55.810
And they have these [SPANISH].

00:28:55.810 --> 00:29:00.440
And they're very colorful
and very strong women.

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:02.500
So they asked me to
create this piece, which

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:05.980
was going to end up being about
six feet tall in ceramics.

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:07.990
So I started to create it.

00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:11.920
We had the heads that are
large orbs, about this big.

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:15.340
We created the heads,
the torso, and the skirt.

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:18.160
And it's during a
time where I was

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:23.860
going through a very difficult
transition in my life.

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:27.640
So we created the skirt,
which is about this tall.

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:32.170
And it's going into
the kiln and it breaks.

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:34.810
And it was very symbolic of
what I was going through.

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:36.180
We created another one.

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:37.390
It went into the kiln.

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:41.020
When it came out,
it was cracked.

00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:42.550
Then we created a third.

00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:43.810
And when it came out--

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:47.830
and in some form, I was in
a stronger place and kind

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:52.090
of more comfortable where
I was and wasn't struggling

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:53.800
so much with the transition.

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:54.854
She came out fine.

00:29:54.854 --> 00:29:57.270
SPEAKER: How long was that
process between the first one--

00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:58.895
YOLANDA GONZALEZ:
It's been six months.

00:29:58.895 --> 00:30:00.490
It was six months.

00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:03.820
And then also, creating the
orbs and the heads for me

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:05.230
was very organic.

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:09.490
And feeling these orbs
and creating the portrait,

00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:14.500
I felt it was like, this is what
it would be like to give birth,

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:15.130
this orb.

00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:17.740
I felt it, and it was cool.

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:22.660
The smell of the clay was
just so beautiful and magical.

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:23.430
So I created her.

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:28.480
It took four men to install her
because she's about 600 pounds.

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:30.970
She was installed.

00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:33.330
And so once she was
installed and I turned around

00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:35.910
and I looked at her, I
cried because I thought,

00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:39.870
we have both completed
this process together.

00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:41.970
And that's what that
piece was for me.

00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:45.420
It was building myself
up again to continue

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:46.505
what I had to continue.

00:30:46.505 --> 00:30:47.640
SPEAKER: Beautiful.

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:48.750
Very symbolic.

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:49.630
Wow.

00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:50.910
So is there anything that--

00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:55.100
I know, transitioning
from that is like--

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:55.600
we cry.

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.516
YOLANDA GONZALEZ: It's
an artist, artist life.

00:30:57.516 --> 00:30:58.820
SPEAKER: Then we get back up.

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:01.342
YOLANDA GONZALEZ: Welcome
to the artist life.

00:31:01.342 --> 00:31:03.300
SPEAKER: So in this roller
coaster of emotions,

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:04.832
is there anything you regret?

00:31:04.832 --> 00:31:05.790
YOLANDA GONZALEZ: None.

00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:06.510
SPEAKER: Nothing?

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:07.593
YOLANDA GONZALEZ: Not one.

00:31:07.593 --> 00:31:13.440
SPEAKER: Is there some
type of artwork or genre

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:16.005
that you would never do?

00:31:16.005 --> 00:31:17.280
ROSALIE LOPEZ: Oh, wow.

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:18.090
SANDRA CORNEJO: Can't
say that, though.

00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:18.470
SPEAKER: I don't know.

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:19.011
I don't know.

00:31:19.011 --> 00:31:19.580
I'm asking.

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:20.520
SANDRA CORNEJO: You
can't say never.

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:21.450
We have so much to--

00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:23.033
SPEAKER: Or that you
wouldn't want to.

00:31:23.033 --> 00:31:24.500
Or that you're
like, have fear of.

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:28.360
Is there like a thing that
you're like, I try to avoid it?

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:29.860
YOLANDA GONZALEZ:
I think if there's

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:32.440
different mediums, because
people will come to you.

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:34.300
I was sent to Japan
to do printmaking.

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:37.810
And I had done some printmaking
at Self Help Graphics, but not

00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:39.310
that much.

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:43.890
But what do you do is
you essentially interpret

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:47.831
it, that style, that
medium, in your process.

00:31:47.831 --> 00:31:48.330
SPEAKER: OK.

00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:49.570
So you make it your own?

00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:50.500
YOLANDA GONZALEZ: Yes.

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:52.585
SPEAKER: And then therefore,
it's accepting to you?

00:31:52.585 --> 00:31:52.960
YOLANDA GONZALEZ: Yes.

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:54.032
SPEAKER: But is there
anything else that you

00:31:54.032 --> 00:31:55.390
were like, I don't know?

00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:57.850
I don't want to go there.

00:31:57.850 --> 00:31:59.560
It's not something
that's my style.

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:00.995
I don't want to--

00:32:00.995 --> 00:32:01.495
maybe?

00:32:05.187 --> 00:32:07.020
ROSALIE LOPEZ: It's an
interesting question.

00:32:10.566 --> 00:32:12.180
When I think about
moments in my life

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:14.850
where I wondered if I had
gone this way versus that way,

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:16.020
I definitely thought about--

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:22.980
there was a time in my life
when I had just graduated

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:25.770
and I got my BFA
degree and I was going

00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:28.380
to be going into grad school.

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:30.390
And there was a
time in between then

00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:34.590
when I lost my
brother unexpectedly

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:36.280
at a very young age.

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:37.417
SPEAKER: Sorry.

00:32:37.417 --> 00:32:38.250
ROSALIE LOPEZ: Yeah.

00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:39.720
He died of an overdose.

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:41.670
And I was like
really distraught.

00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:44.880
And my family was out of
state, and I was in California.

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:46.080
I stayed here in California.

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:47.079
And they had moved away.

00:32:47.079 --> 00:32:49.110
And I really felt like I
wanted to be with them.

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:52.026
And it was so difficult. But
here I am in a part of my life

00:32:52.026 --> 00:32:54.150
where I'm supposed to decide
where out of state I'm

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:54.930
going to school.

00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:57.090
And it was a horrible
feeling that should

00:32:57.090 --> 00:32:59.170
have been like much different.

00:32:59.170 --> 00:33:04.530
And so my heart wanted to go to
New Mexico where my family was.

00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:09.930
And I had gotten an opportunity
to go to grad school

00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:11.970
on a Fulbright
Scholarship in Indiana

00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:15.120
University and the thought
of going across the country,

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:16.920
leaving Los Angeles
and going to a place

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:20.724
where you really are different.

00:33:20.724 --> 00:33:21.930
SPEAKER: Sure.

00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:22.617
Yeah.

00:33:22.617 --> 00:33:24.200
ROSALIE LOPEZ: It
was heart-wrenching.

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:26.550
It was my mom's advice
that sort of pushed me

00:33:26.550 --> 00:33:28.620
into continuing to
go into that route.

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:32.220
Because it was like, that's what
he would have wanted you to do.

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:33.640
But it wasn't what
I wanted to do.

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:35.370
I wanted to go and be with them.

00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:38.610
So I wondered what my life
would be like if I had continued

00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:39.892
and lived out--

00:33:39.892 --> 00:33:41.850
I don't know, maybe
applied to school out there

00:33:41.850 --> 00:33:44.640
and decided to go a
different route with my life.

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:47.040
But while I was in
Indiana, I totally

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:50.440
got immersed in
using altars as a way

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:57.675
to remember to heal and to
learn to have my own voice.

00:33:57.675 --> 00:34:01.530
And living in that
place where there's not

00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:04.230
as much social diversity
as we have in Los Angeles,

00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:06.450
it really forced me to
have to talk about my work

00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:08.010
to people who didn't
understand it.

00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:08.699
SANDRA CORNEJO: Which is good.

00:34:08.699 --> 00:34:09.280
SPEAKER: Of course.

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.446
ROSALIE LOPEZ: It was great.

00:34:10.446 --> 00:34:12.610
Yeah, that experience
was very difficult.

00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:15.520
But also, I think that--

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:16.020
yeah.

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:17.860
It just was a point in
my life where I thought,

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:19.276
I wonder how I
would have ended up

00:34:19.276 --> 00:34:21.225
if I had gone somewhere
else versus here.

00:34:21.225 --> 00:34:22.670
SPEAKER: Of course.

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:23.692
Wow.

00:34:23.692 --> 00:34:26.159
Yeah.

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:28.020
Speechless a bit?

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:29.219
Very strong women.

00:34:29.219 --> 00:34:30.060
Wow.

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:31.156
I love all these stories.

00:34:31.156 --> 00:34:31.739
And thank you.

00:34:31.739 --> 00:34:33.524
They're very personal.

00:34:33.524 --> 00:34:36.070
We're very thankful that
you're sharing that with us.

00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:37.144
I feel like I'm part of--

00:34:37.144 --> 00:34:38.810
like I'm in your homes
and you're like--

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:41.010
I need to give you some
[SPANISH] or [SPANISH]..

00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:42.909
SANDRA CORNEJO:
Where's the [SPANISH]??

00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:44.882
SPEAKER: I'm like, this
is really emotional.

00:34:44.882 --> 00:34:49.139
[INAUDIBLE] getting in touch
with these beautiful stories.

00:34:49.139 --> 00:34:49.920
Thank you.

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:52.070
Wow.

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:52.639
OK.

00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:56.550
So I want to touch a little
bit more on the whole aspect

00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:59.774
that you were just
touching on of you

00:34:59.774 --> 00:35:02.190
had to explain your art to
people who really didn't get it

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:03.720
or didn't understand it.

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:05.010
How was that process?

00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:06.570
Have you had that
experience, too?

00:35:10.887 --> 00:35:12.470
ROSALIE LOPEZ: I'm
going to speak as--

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:16.710
acknowledging the fact that I'm
very young in this environment.

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:21.710
But it made me realize how much
more I had to study and learn

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:25.120
the artists who were working
in this form before me.

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:26.690
And understand
their conversations

00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:29.106
and where it was coming from
because it helped me build up

00:35:29.106 --> 00:35:31.610
my strength to even be able
to communicate these things.

00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:34.610
I want to talk about
a person's life

00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:37.760
and celebrate it without
feeling the drabness of death

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.230
and leaving this life.

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:41.300
And I want to celebrate
them and the lessons

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:42.385
that they taught me.

00:35:42.385 --> 00:35:43.260
And how do I do that?

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:46.730
And Dia de los Muertos
and altars and ofrendras

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:48.800
gave me that venue to be
able to talk about it.

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.840
So I studied.

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:51.830
I researched.

00:35:51.830 --> 00:35:56.210
I definitely wanted
to investigate

00:35:56.210 --> 00:36:00.080
a lot of Chicanas who were
using altars as another way.

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:02.300
Not just to commemorate
their [INAUDIBLE],,

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:05.090
but as a way to talk about
the social dynamics of where

00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:06.420
they're coming from.

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:10.645
And how they can communicate
that in a public atmosphere.

00:36:10.645 --> 00:36:13.640
It doesn't have to be
in a whitewall gallery.

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:15.840
It can be in a public space.

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:20.451
So growing up in LA, and having
places like Self Help Graphics

00:36:20.451 --> 00:36:22.909
that are pioneering contemporary
Dia de los Muertos, de los

00:36:22.909 --> 00:36:25.410
Muertos, the Chicanoized
version of Dia de los Muertos,

00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:28.240
it was like setting
the pathway for me

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:31.160
to discuss all of
these things and to be

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:33.770
who I wanted to be and
talk about my family

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:37.640
and also my situation and relate
it to everyone else around me.

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:41.150
And even though I was
all the way in Indiana,

00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:44.350
I had the access to resources
to do this homework,

00:36:44.350 --> 00:36:48.900
to look at books and
to read and research.

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:51.590
So when I came back home, I
felt like a lot more empowered

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:53.510
to understand it when
you kind of take it

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:55.460
for granted a little
bit growing up in it.

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:57.057
SPEAKER: Sure.

00:36:57.057 --> 00:36:57.890
ROSALIE LOPEZ: Yeah.

00:36:57.890 --> 00:36:58.340
SPEAKER: That's great.

00:36:58.340 --> 00:36:59.965
And you empowered a
ton of other people

00:36:59.965 --> 00:37:01.265
and now they're more educated.

00:37:01.265 --> 00:37:03.787
You empowered everyone here.

00:37:03.787 --> 00:37:04.620
ROSALIE LOPEZ: Yeah.

00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:06.680
It's more than just like
[SPANISH] and makeup.

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:08.630
And you know, let's
not forget this--

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:10.130
SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]
pretty picture.

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:11.310
Exactly.

00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:12.350
Of course.

00:37:12.350 --> 00:37:13.940
Thank you.

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:15.566
Sandra, you were
going to say anything?

00:37:15.566 --> 00:37:16.065
No?

00:37:16.065 --> 00:37:16.640
Maybe?

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:17.891
But I do have a question.

00:37:17.891 --> 00:37:18.390
Tell me.

00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:22.220
So we were discussing this
voice that you have as artists.

00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:25.670
How has social media, or
digital, or technology

00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:28.650
helped your careers?

00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:30.560
Or not?

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:31.937
Maybe not.

00:37:31.937 --> 00:37:33.520
SANDRA CORNEJO: Well,
I mean, it helps

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:36.130
in the sense of
having you connected

00:37:36.130 --> 00:37:38.340
with so many of your
peers and your colleagues.

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:41.650
And I mean, being
able to research.

00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:48.010
And especially the way that
I gather source material.

00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:52.000
I very much needed the
internet and social media

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.140
to be able to do that.

00:37:56.122 --> 00:37:58.430
But in particular, maybe.

00:37:58.430 --> 00:37:59.122
I don't know.

00:37:59.122 --> 00:38:00.267
Maybe not.

00:38:00.267 --> 00:38:00.850
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:38:00.850 --> 00:38:04.990
I'm very intrigued by
the fact that art is now

00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:06.670
accessible to all.

00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:08.740
So the minute you
do something, it

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:11.530
is seen by millions and
millions of eyeballs

00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:13.990
all over the world instantly.

00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:16.660
And so when you're making this
now, because it's different.

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:18.250
Maybe even 30 years ago, right?

00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:19.390
YOLANDA GONZALEZ: Oh, yeah.

00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:20.990
SPEAKER: I mean, when you're
creating something now--

00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:22.448
ROSALIE LOPEZ: I
want to hear hers.

00:38:22.448 --> 00:38:25.090
YOLANDA GONZALEZ: I was
excited about beepers.

00:38:25.090 --> 00:38:26.380
ROSALIE LOPEZ: Page me.

00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:28.660
YOLANDA GONZALEZ: How can
I make love with a beeper?

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:29.780
Turn it around.

00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:30.573
It's not 8-3-8-3.

00:38:30.573 --> 00:38:31.726
It's love.

00:38:31.726 --> 00:38:32.850
SPEAKER: It's 1-4-3, 1-4-3.

00:38:32.850 --> 00:38:33.990
I was there, too.

00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:36.520
YOLANDA GONZALEZ: I remember
the phones with the long cords.

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:38.104
Yeah.

00:38:38.104 --> 00:38:40.270
SPEAKER: So Yolanda, I have
a question for you then.

00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:42.280
So in the 30-year
span, you've gone

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:44.390
from you didn't have
digital, really,

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:46.510
to now having people
see your artwork,

00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:49.254
if they wanted to,
around the world.

00:38:49.254 --> 00:38:50.920
Does it change now
your perspective when

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:53.660
you're painting in the
sense that before, people

00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:55.870
would go and--

00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:58.299
wherever you had the
exhibition, people would see it.

00:38:58.299 --> 00:38:59.590
It was that [INAUDIBLE] people.

00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:00.460
Maybe you toured.

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:02.890
Whatever it is, those are
the people who saw it, right?

00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:04.240
Who seeked it out.

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:06.160
But now anybody can
see it and share it.

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:09.100
Does that change
how you paint now

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:13.264
and the voice or the
message you want to give?

00:39:13.264 --> 00:39:15.430
YOLANDA GONZALEZ: I think
it changes a lot of things

00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:17.140
except for the way I paint.

00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:20.050
Because the painting
process and my relationship

00:39:20.050 --> 00:39:23.590
with the creative process
is very pure to me.

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:25.060
It's very sacred.

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:29.140
And so that is very strong one
of the strongest relationships

00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:30.910
I have.

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:36.100
But it's very exciting
to me to share.

00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:39.940
And what I like to
do is put a piece--

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:42.760
when I first start the
sketch, the rough, when

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:44.980
it's almost done, and
then when it's completed.

00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:47.350
So people can kind
of see the process

00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:51.880
of what's happening
of creation, so be it.

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:55.300
People put their kid's pictures
every month on Facebook.

00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:58.105
And I put my paintings
every month on Facebook.

00:39:58.105 --> 00:39:59.431
Those are my babies.

00:39:59.431 --> 00:39:59.930
That's it.

00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:01.110
ROSALIE LOPEZ: I think that's
what's exciting about it,

00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:04.180
is like we get to see the
studio practice unfurled

00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:06.145
in front of us on
Instagram and Facebook.

00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:11.320
And it's also hard to get used
to it, to opening people up

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:12.055
to that process.

00:40:12.055 --> 00:40:13.930
SANDRA CORNEJO: How much
do you want to show?

00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:15.940
How much is exposed?

00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:18.357
Like you want to keep some of
those things private, right?

00:40:18.357 --> 00:40:20.689
YOLANDA GONZALEZ: It's whatever
you're comfortable with.

00:40:20.689 --> 00:40:22.750
It's whatever you're
comfortable really sharing.

00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:23.800
Because it's out there.

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.720
And once it's out
there, it's out there.

00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:27.880
But it is amazing.

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:33.070
And I've utilized it
to the fullest where

00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:34.960
you send out your message.

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:36.340
And you send out your images.

00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:37.900
And then, you
represent messages that

00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:40.750
need to be represented as well.

00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:47.354
But I think it's a fascinating
process, the internet.

00:40:47.354 --> 00:40:48.520
It's just fascinating to me.

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:52.180
And I'm such a gadget person.

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:53.470
I love that.

00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:58.690
So anything I can get my little
hands on and expose people

00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:01.570
to what's going on, or my
world, my little utopian,

00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:03.570
strange world, it's there.

00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:04.780
SPEAKER: That's great.

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:06.982
ROSALIE LOPEZ: It's exciting.

00:41:06.982 --> 00:41:08.440
I feel like we're
living in a world

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:10.565
where there's all kinds of
new technology happening

00:41:10.565 --> 00:41:11.560
all the time.

00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:13.900
And as artists, we
get to figure out how

00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:15.470
to interpret that and use that.

00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:19.720
I'm a printmaker.

00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:21.659
And it's one of those
classic dying forms

00:41:21.659 --> 00:41:23.200
that people don't
like to use anymore

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:24.850
because it's very cumbersome.

00:41:24.850 --> 00:41:26.830
But there's always
this conversation

00:41:26.830 --> 00:41:28.990
on how we're pulling
from new technology

00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:30.490
to influence our work.

00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:33.340
So how do we keep it
relevant in this age

00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:38.170
of like constant
technology upgrades?

00:41:38.170 --> 00:41:41.500
I'd like to see how it impacts
the conversation I want to have

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:45.520
or the way I envision
a piece happening.

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:48.170
Some of the ways that I've used
it is I'm a graphic designer.

00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:50.710
So a lot of the work also
starts off on the computer

00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:54.340
and using digital programs or
digitizing the work somehow.

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:57.290
And then, seeing how
the work can transmute.

00:41:57.290 --> 00:42:00.490
I've had a chance to use CNC
router machines to create

00:42:00.490 --> 00:42:03.990
custom furniture pieces that are
reminiscent of my papel picado

00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:04.490
patterns.

00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:06.300
And that was an
amazing experience

00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:07.759
or like laser-cutting
machines that

00:42:07.759 --> 00:42:09.758
take papel picado [INAUDIBLE]
whole other world.

00:42:09.758 --> 00:42:11.590
What happens when the
machine cuts it out?

00:42:11.590 --> 00:42:14.980
And you have these little burned
edges and how those things

00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:16.630
start to impact the message.

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:21.520
And I'd be excited to be able
to play with it even more.

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:25.180
I think what becomes a biggest
deterrent is accessibility.

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:26.120
It's expensive.

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:28.760
It's hard to get access to.

00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:31.400
Especially once you're outside
and you don't have access

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:33.530
to a university or
anything like that,

00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:39.380
how do you use this
equipment in your work?

00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:42.680
Yeah, I'd be excited to try
to learn to use it more.

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:47.190
And it provides
another way for you

00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:50.040
to have that communication
so any other way that I

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:52.530
can try to use technology.

00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:54.360
I've used it for
sharing the stories

00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:56.460
that I'm collecting to
have this online archive

00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:59.250
or an online altar.

00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:02.280
So I try to use it
as much as possible,

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:06.720
but I think that there's
also some deterrence because

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:08.409
of the accessibility of it, too.

00:43:08.409 --> 00:43:09.200
SPEAKER: Of course.

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:10.110
ROSALIE LOPEZ: Yeah.

00:43:10.110 --> 00:43:12.110
SPEAKER: They're big machines
you're talking about, too.

00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:12.740
ROSALIE LOPEZ: Yeah.

00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:14.430
I'm interested in how
they collide, though.

00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:16.110
How do you think the old
school and the classic

00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:17.410
with like the new technology?

00:43:17.410 --> 00:43:19.520
SPEAKER: And there's the
3D printers now, too.

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:20.895
ROSALIE LOPEZ:
Yeah, 3D printing.

00:43:20.895 --> 00:43:23.231
I'd love to mess around
with that kind of machinery.

00:43:23.231 --> 00:43:23.730
Yeah.

00:43:23.730 --> 00:43:24.810
SPEAKER: Nice.

00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:27.400
Well, so now I'm going to open
it up to the audience as well.

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:29.940
If you have any
questions at all, please,

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:31.449
this is your time to--

00:43:31.449 --> 00:43:33.240
SANDRA CORNEJO: There's
the microphone box.

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:33.300
SPEAKER: See?

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:34.210
The one we were talking about.

00:43:34.210 --> 00:43:35.418
The one you can throw around.

00:43:35.418 --> 00:43:37.600
ROSALIE LOPEZ: A Google Cube.

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:40.185
SPEAKER: Anybody have questions?

00:43:40.185 --> 00:43:41.670
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:42.660
[INAUDIBLE]

00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:48.454
Hi, everyone.

00:43:48.454 --> 00:43:49.120
My name is Eric.

00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:51.540
So first of all, thank you
guys for spending an afternoon

00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:51.930
with us.

00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:54.305
I thought this was really
interesting and really awesome.

00:43:54.305 --> 00:43:56.910
And I'm really happy
that you guys came by.

00:43:56.910 --> 00:43:59.440
So now, my question
is, a few months ago,

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:04.350
there was like a case in Canada,
where a writer was criticized

00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:07.410
for saying that other writers
and artists should take

00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:10.200
and write from the point of
view of different ethnicities,

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:11.912
cultures, genders,
and background.

00:44:11.912 --> 00:44:14.370
And so I was kind of curious
to hear what you guys thought,

00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:18.844
if you would encourage others to
sort of take the point of view

00:44:18.844 --> 00:44:20.760
of people that come from
different backgrounds

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:21.301
that they do?

00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:25.920
YOLANDA GONZALEZ: I think
that's a big responsibility.

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:26.795
SPEAKER: It is, yeah.

00:44:26.795 --> 00:44:28.590
YOLANDA GONZALEZ: I
only have my own view.

00:44:28.590 --> 00:44:34.200
And I can't expect everybody
to respect or accept

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:38.950
my point of view on a whole
of a culture, an ethnicity.

00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:40.107
I don't think that's right.

00:44:40.107 --> 00:44:41.940
SANDRA CORNEJO: I think
any artist out there

00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:43.890
that's making work--

00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:45.780
I mean, their true
aspiration should

00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:51.130
be to convey a truly honest
perspective of their own.

00:44:51.130 --> 00:44:53.652
So I feel like being
able to share that.

00:44:53.652 --> 00:44:55.110
I mean, that's how
other people are

00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:57.570
able to learn about it, right?

00:44:57.570 --> 00:45:01.110
But to put yourself
in a different place?

00:45:01.110 --> 00:45:02.010
It gets tricky.

00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:02.880
SPEAKER: Of course.

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:03.390
ROSALIE LOPEZ: You
don't want to be

00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:06.340
put in a position where you're
the spokesperson for everyone.

00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:07.770
And that just doesn't seem fair.

00:45:07.770 --> 00:45:11.340
It's important to be
inclusive, to be aware.

00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:15.480
But to be put in
the position of I'm

00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:18.060
the spokesperson for
Latinas, and I would never

00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:19.700
want that responsibility.

00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:22.590
There's too many voices
out there to be heard.

00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:27.120
So yeah, that's a
pretty tough criticism.

00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:27.757
Yeah.

00:45:27.757 --> 00:45:29.340
SPEAKER: It's also
a lot of hard work.

00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:30.548
ROSALIE LOPEZ: Good question.

00:45:30.548 --> 00:45:31.830
Yeah.

00:45:31.830 --> 00:45:32.590
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:32.980
AUDIENCE: Definitely.

00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:34.080
And I completely agree.

00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:38.630
Like I mean, there's the variety
of opinions about it, I guess.

00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:42.170
And like on one side,
you should say like, oh,

00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:44.375
by encouraging people to
talk about cultures that

00:45:44.375 --> 00:45:45.750
are different than
their own, you

00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:48.750
encourage them to
find commonalities,

00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:51.429
to find ways to empathize.

00:45:51.429 --> 00:45:53.970
And then from the other point
of view, kind of like you said,

00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:56.130
it's, well, there
are many people that

00:45:56.130 --> 00:45:58.020
could talk about this
particular experience,

00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:01.470
so why is somebody that may
not have as much experience

00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:04.680
or knowledge in that background
take it upon themselves

00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:05.909
to talk about it?

00:46:05.909 --> 00:46:08.200
So I was kind of curious to
hear what you guys thought.

00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:09.240
So thank you.

00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:10.990
ROSALIE LOPEZ: Thank
you for the question.

00:46:13.791 --> 00:46:14.540
AUDIENCE: So cool.

00:46:16.932 --> 00:46:18.640
Ladies, thank you so
much for being here.

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:22.330
And I want to take it to
the business perspective.

00:46:22.330 --> 00:46:28.480
Women traditionally make
$0.72 of the dollar of males.

00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:33.010
Black women make $0.62
and Latinas even less.

00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:35.800
So I'm wondering, in terms
of your male counterparts

00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:39.160
as artists when you're
comparing art to art, do

00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:41.530
you find yourself having to--

00:46:41.530 --> 00:46:46.137
or not making as much as
men do in the industry?

00:46:46.137 --> 00:46:48.220
ROSALIE LOPEZ: Do we choose
to price it less than,

00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:48.440
is that what you're saying?

00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:48.981
AUDIENCE: No.

00:46:48.981 --> 00:46:51.480
Are people wanting you to
charge less because you're

00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:54.590
women or Latinas?

00:46:54.590 --> 00:46:55.771
SPEAKER: That's interesting.

00:46:59.449 --> 00:47:01.240
SANDRA CORNEJO: I've
seen that on both ends

00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:04.279
of the different artists
I've worked with since being

00:47:04.279 --> 00:47:04.945
in Los Angeles--

00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:12.040
the more recognized, like male
figure, and a woman that's

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:15.190
been struggling and
really putting in the work

00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:18.550
since she began,
like decades ago.

00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:23.200
And just realizing
that there's that--

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:28.690
like women tend to
under-price their work.

00:47:28.690 --> 00:47:31.060
I don't know.

00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:34.200
It's difficult.

00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:37.230
YOLANDA GONZALEZ: I
think as a woman artist,

00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:42.480
it's important not to
under-price my work,

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:47.480
to value my work for the years
that I've been creating art.

00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:51.270
And it's been 30 long years.

00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:56.640
And I think it's a huge
responsibility for the artists,

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.800
the young artists,
who are following

00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:02.640
me to open the door for them
not only through my art,

00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:04.300
but through my business sense.

00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:08.399
So you educate people to pay if
they want a piece of your art.

00:48:08.399 --> 00:48:09.690
They want a piece of your soul.

00:48:09.690 --> 00:48:12.599
They're paying for it properly.

00:48:12.599 --> 00:48:14.890
SANDRA CORNEJO: And if they
don't buy it at that price,

00:48:14.890 --> 00:48:15.800
then they don't deserve it.

00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:17.883
YOLANDA GONZALEZ: If they
don't buy at that price,

00:48:17.883 --> 00:48:19.690
somebody else will.

00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:21.250
And I have little pieces.

00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:23.080
You can get a little
piece about this big.

00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:23.920
You can take home.

00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:25.077
That will be fine.

00:48:25.077 --> 00:48:26.542
SPEAKER: Nice.

00:48:26.542 --> 00:48:28.750
SANDRA CORNEJO: Yeah, you
just got to know your worth

00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:29.807
and stick to it.

00:48:29.807 --> 00:48:32.140
YOLANDA GONZALEZ: And it's
hard because a lot of artists

00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:35.100
are not businesspeople.

00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:38.230
I think it's
difficult to separate

00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:42.070
because you're emotionally
involved to this piece of art.

00:48:42.070 --> 00:48:44.260
But then what you do
is you find somebody

00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:50.910
who you trust to represent your
art and to market it that way.

00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:51.680
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:52.910
ROSALIE LOPEZ: Yeah.

00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:57.320
I struggle with that a
lot as well because I

00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:59.210
worry about accessibility.

00:48:59.210 --> 00:49:04.370
And I think that when
those things are true,

00:49:04.370 --> 00:49:06.590
pricing and the
time and what you've

00:49:06.590 --> 00:49:09.830
invested, where your career
is at, all of those things

00:49:09.830 --> 00:49:11.630
that factor into pricing.

00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:13.460
And then, some of the
things I worry about

00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:15.860
is like, who can buy that?

00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:17.450
Who is going to be
able to buy that?

00:49:17.450 --> 00:49:19.430
Who am I making it for?

00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:22.370
And even though I
know it's not going

00:49:22.370 --> 00:49:24.830
to make me very much
money, I want my artwork

00:49:24.830 --> 00:49:25.770
to be accessible.

00:49:25.770 --> 00:49:28.520
I don't want it to be
unreachable, unattainable for

00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:30.260
people to be able to purchase.

00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:32.330
So I need to hire
a businessperson.

00:49:32.330 --> 00:49:36.200
[LAUGHS] I feel like I
want a little of both.

00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:38.727
I think that creating
tiers of work

00:49:38.727 --> 00:49:40.310
that you can sell
for different prices

00:49:40.310 --> 00:49:43.040
helps to make things
that are accessible.

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:46.040
And you have bigger ideas.

00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:49.640
A lot of my work is
installation artwork, too.

00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:51.180
I don't really intend on--

00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:52.730
it's a temporary installation.

00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:54.420
And it exists for
that point in time.

00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:57.790
So sales, a lot of times,
aren't really the driving force.

00:49:57.790 --> 00:50:00.650
It's more like, how can
I complete this idea?

00:50:00.650 --> 00:50:02.960
I just moved back to Los
Angeles after living away

00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:03.680
for six years.

00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:06.560
And this past year
that I've been back,

00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:08.115
I've really been
forced to think--

00:50:08.115 --> 00:50:10.490
the people and the friends
that I've met have really made

00:50:10.490 --> 00:50:12.200
me think a lot about pricing.

00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:16.430
And I was sort of living in, I
feel like, my own little dream

00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:18.800
world of I just want
to do the idea, man.

00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:20.990
I'm just trying to get
this idea out there.

00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:23.180
The cash wasn't even about it.

00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:25.070
And that's kind of
the struggling part,

00:50:25.070 --> 00:50:27.987
so that's why I teach.

00:50:27.987 --> 00:50:29.570
That's one of the
reasons why I teach.

00:50:29.570 --> 00:50:30.361
SPEAKER: Of course.

00:50:30.361 --> 00:50:32.570
SANDRA CORNEJO: Got
to have that side job.

00:50:32.570 --> 00:50:34.340
ROSALIE LOPEZ: So I
can have that freeness

00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:36.560
to be able to create what
I want to create and not

00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:37.690
be driven by the price.

00:50:37.690 --> 00:50:40.460
But it's a struggling
game of back and forth.

00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:42.710
And you know, Yolanda's
very established

00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:45.950
and has a lot of years.

00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:49.280
And I hope one day to
kind of get to a level

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:55.190
where I can be a lot more
demanding with it, too.

00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:59.630
But I also think there's
a line, too, about where

00:50:59.630 --> 00:51:02.330
you want to be open and
have people find you and get

00:51:02.330 --> 00:51:06.170
to know you and create that
relationship through being

00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:08.670
a little more accessible.

00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:10.487
Yeah, it's difficult.
It's very difficult.

00:51:10.487 --> 00:51:12.570
YOLANDA GONZALEZ: I think
as far as accessibility,

00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:14.270
if somebody comes
into the studio

00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:19.460
and they really want a piece,
instead of lowering the price,

00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:21.590
if it's a small
piece or something,

00:51:21.590 --> 00:51:23.850
I'll just give it to them.

00:51:23.850 --> 00:51:25.405
ROSALIE LOPEZ: I
got payment plans.

00:51:25.405 --> 00:51:26.324
YOLANDA GONZALEZ: No.

00:51:26.324 --> 00:51:27.240
I literally just say--

00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:28.380
ROSALIE LOPEZ: Layaway.

00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:30.540
YOLANDA GONZALEZ: I
just say, take it.

00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:31.810
If you want it, take it.

00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:37.190
I have a watercolor series
that's really, really

00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:39.020
reasonable for my work.

00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:41.480
But some of the paintings now--

00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:44.795
when I was your guys age, I
would paint five, six, seven,

00:51:44.795 --> 00:51:46.970
10 paintings in a week.

00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:47.470
Now--

00:51:47.470 --> 00:51:50.100
ROSALIE LOPEZ: Pump it out.

00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:53.670
YOLANDA GONZALEZ: That's
why I have shoulder pain.

00:51:53.670 --> 00:51:56.710
But now, it's once a month.

00:51:56.710 --> 00:51:59.360
It's It slows down.

00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:02.410
But that's just where I'm at.

00:52:02.410 --> 00:52:05.372
That's just what 30 years
of the process has taken me.

00:52:05.372 --> 00:52:06.830
And I have to be
accepting of that.

00:52:06.830 --> 00:52:10.130
I'm not 25 anymore.

00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:14.610
But anytime you want to come
over and talk, we'll talk.

00:52:14.610 --> 00:52:15.110
I'm there.

00:52:15.110 --> 00:52:16.148
I'm open to that.

00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:21.938
SPEAKER: Any other questions?

00:52:24.930 --> 00:52:27.420
So I'm going to end with
one last one since--

00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:28.350
any other questions?

00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:35.250
Back to the next
generation, I love--

00:52:35.250 --> 00:52:40.270
there's a ton of people who
not only are digital natives.

00:52:40.270 --> 00:52:43.220
They don't know anything
else but the online world

00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:45.800
but also are really
intrigued or really want

00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:48.845
to explore art as part
of who they are, maybe

00:52:48.845 --> 00:52:50.930
as their career.

00:52:50.930 --> 00:52:54.230
What advice can you give
them, for this next generation

00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:55.700
of artists?

00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:58.210
I always believe that you
can't just have technology.

00:52:58.210 --> 00:52:59.210
You can't just have art.

00:52:59.210 --> 00:53:02.840
I think the combination
works really nicely now,

00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:07.040
especially now with STEAM,
where you can do both.

00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:10.250
What advice can you give the
next generation of people

00:53:10.250 --> 00:53:12.320
or kids who want to pursue art?

00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:18.770
YOLANDA GONZALEZ: I think
just the old classic,

00:53:18.770 --> 00:53:20.060
follow your dream.

00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:25.430
But now, the dream is very large
and vast with the internet.

00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:27.560
And I think it's
amazing for them

00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:31.160
to have that accessibility
to the internet.

00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:34.760
But I also think that the
classic way of learning art

00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:36.210
is very important.

00:53:36.210 --> 00:53:38.720
So I think if there
is a way to have

00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:42.770
the classic way of learning
art, which is pencil, charcoal,

00:53:42.770 --> 00:53:49.460
still life and then transfer
that into the internet,

00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:52.670
and combine it, and incorporate
it, and collaborate with it.

00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:55.793
I think that's the fascinating
part of the new art we're going

00:53:55.793 --> 00:54:00.190
to be seeing in the future.

00:54:00.190 --> 00:54:01.522
SPEAKER: Nice.

00:54:01.522 --> 00:54:03.230
SANDRA CORNEJO: Know
where you come from.

00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:06.710
Continue to be curious,
explore, and just

00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:10.280
continue to ask questions,
like within your own work.

00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:11.247
Definitely.

00:54:11.247 --> 00:54:11.830
SPEAKER: Nice.

00:54:15.374 --> 00:54:16.540
ROSALIE LOPEZ: I don't know.

00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:20.440
I have thought about this
question a few different ways.

00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:23.610
There's a lot of artists now who
solely exist on social media,

00:54:23.610 --> 00:54:27.060
like their main venues
are on social media.

00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:30.520
And they have a really hard
time doing the classic stuff.

00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:31.260
[INAUDIBLE]

00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:33.330
Like, I already got
this many followers

00:54:33.330 --> 00:54:34.955
and they're all--
you know what I mean?

00:54:34.955 --> 00:54:36.746
It's a different
way of thinking.

00:54:36.746 --> 00:54:38.370
But I think that's
the challenge of how

00:54:38.370 --> 00:54:43.290
the classic and traditional
still engage that newer age,

00:54:43.290 --> 00:54:44.909
because they found
ways to bypass

00:54:44.909 --> 00:54:46.200
a lot of the traditional stuff.

00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:50.010
Why do I need to learn how
to draw the figure if I'm

00:54:50.010 --> 00:54:55.530
doing specific performances
in random spots in LA

00:54:55.530 --> 00:54:57.630
and I'm getting commissions?

00:54:57.630 --> 00:54:59.430
And they're getting
paid for doing it.

00:54:59.430 --> 00:55:01.020
So it's the challenge
that I think

00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:02.910
that the institution
hasn't quite yet led up

00:55:02.910 --> 00:55:06.120
to learning how to teach
those students how to keep up

00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:08.520
with it all, because they're
struggling with keeping up

00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:11.740
with that new technology.

00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:14.350
I think, too, that
I remember being

00:55:14.350 --> 00:55:20.110
a student and the mode of
thinking being like, concept,

00:55:20.110 --> 00:55:21.250
concept, concept.

00:55:21.250 --> 00:55:23.870
And those things
are really amazing.

00:55:23.870 --> 00:55:27.422
If you're wanting
to be an artist,

00:55:27.422 --> 00:55:28.880
there's different
types of artists.

00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:30.730
Some people just paint
in their basements

00:55:30.730 --> 00:55:32.350
and never expose
it to the public.

00:55:32.350 --> 00:55:34.414
It's about that moment
that they're creating.

00:55:34.414 --> 00:55:36.580
And it's not really about
sharing it with everybody.

00:55:36.580 --> 00:55:37.990
Some other people
have the yearning

00:55:37.990 --> 00:55:39.573
to want to share it
out in the public.

00:55:39.573 --> 00:55:41.530
And it's about that
communication, the way

00:55:41.530 --> 00:55:44.170
that people perceive
it in a public space.

00:55:44.170 --> 00:55:46.060
And that's what
drives that force.

00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:48.700
So I don't know that I would
have one piece of advice

00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:49.210
for artists.

00:55:49.210 --> 00:55:55.330
It would be like, what's
your main goal for this?

00:55:55.330 --> 00:55:58.210
Yeah, it's like STEM is
huge right now in schools.

00:55:58.210 --> 00:56:00.670
And you hear-- like I'm
looking for jobs all the time

00:56:00.670 --> 00:56:03.700
and they want to know how
you can incorporate STEM

00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:06.080
into your curriculum.

00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:08.020
And I think that
acceleratingly, it's

00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:10.390
more important because the
schools have stripped away

00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:12.850
like a lot of those arts and
creatives out of the school,

00:56:12.850 --> 00:56:14.890
but they want to
bring it on again

00:56:14.890 --> 00:56:19.120
as an educational component
to teach them science,

00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:20.950
to teach them all
these other things.

00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:23.532
But where can art
exist just for art?

00:56:23.532 --> 00:56:25.990
When you're a kid, you think
you're thinking about concept?

00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:26.489
No.

00:56:26.489 --> 00:56:28.150
You're remembering
that fun part of why

00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:30.730
you want to make art,
of what it is to create.

00:56:30.730 --> 00:56:32.230
And it's important
not to lose that.

00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:34.600
We're so strained, I think,
to have this a greater,

00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:36.070
bigger social message.

00:56:36.070 --> 00:56:37.880
And those things
are very important,

00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:41.260
but there should also still
live a space where you can just

00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:42.645
be free to create just because.

00:56:42.645 --> 00:56:45.790
And you may not
know why, but you

00:56:45.790 --> 00:56:47.800
need to have that
happen at the same time

00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:50.530
that other people are more
driven by that message.

00:56:50.530 --> 00:56:53.170
So to have both
existing simultaneously,

00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:54.572
I think and not
knock people down

00:56:54.572 --> 00:56:56.530
for having a different
way of thinking about it

00:56:56.530 --> 00:56:59.064
or working with it.

00:56:59.064 --> 00:56:59.980
SPEAKER: That's great.

00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:01.546
I agree completely.

00:57:01.546 --> 00:57:02.920
I think there's
a space for both.

00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:04.260
And also, separately.

00:57:04.260 --> 00:57:04.570
ROSALIE LOPEZ: Yeah.

00:57:04.570 --> 00:57:05.486
SPEAKER: And together.

00:57:05.486 --> 00:57:07.270
Why not, right?

00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:08.840
Again, thank you so, so much.

00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:09.920
You've been wonderful.

00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:12.352

beautiful, personal stories,

00:57:12.352 --> 00:57:14.560

00:57:19.020 --> 00:57:20.145
