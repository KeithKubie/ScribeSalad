archetypal themes are archetypal because
 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.380 align:start position:0%
archetypal themes are archetypal because
they<00:00:19.529><c> actually</c><00:00:20.039><c> speak</c><00:00:20.430><c> of</c><00:00:20.670><c> the</c><00:00:20.910><c> structure</c><00:00:21.359><c> of</c>

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 align:start position:0%
they actually speak of the structure of
 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.750 align:start position:0%
they actually speak of the structure of

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
human experience that's why they last
 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.810 align:start position:0%
human experience that's why they last
and<00:00:24.180><c> so</c><00:00:24.750><c> it's</c><00:00:25.080><c> human</c><00:00:25.529><c> nature</c><00:00:25.769><c> and</c><00:00:26.400><c> human</c>

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 align:start position:0%
and so it's human nature and human
 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.019 align:start position:0%
and so it's human nature and human
