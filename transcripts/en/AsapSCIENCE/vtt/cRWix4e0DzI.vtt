00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.720
The UN estimates by 2050

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.300
3.2 million people will be 100 years or older,

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.920
compared to 316 000 in 2011.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.580
So, what can you do to become a part of this

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.140
elite centenarian club?

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.240
How can you, live to 100?

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.120
There are some obvious steps like,

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.300
stop getting take-out.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.920
65 year-olds who cooked 5 times a week

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.840
were 45% more likely to live an extra decade.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.740
Being a vegetarian means you have a

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.720
12% lowered risk of premature death.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.320
And, if you have to keep eating meat,

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.700
lay off the cold-cuts.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.900
Processed meats like sausage, bacon and cold-cuts

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.340
are linked to a higher incidence of

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.260
dying from cancer and heart disease.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.460
Less oviously, could you win an Oscar?

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.360
Winners, on average live

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.420
4 years longer than their losing peers.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.100
Even a Nobel Prize could help,

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.408
as finalists end up to living

00:00:50.408 --> 00:00:52.340
1 to 2 years longer than their runner-ups.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.080
Now, it may be time to move.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.080
The 20 counties in the US with the highest expediencies,

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.660
also have average altitudes of 5967 feet above sea level

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.460
In Japan, woman live to 87 on average, and men to 80.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.300
Compared to the US

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.000
with 82 and 77 years old, respectively.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.840
Then, like the Japanese,

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.480
You should start consuming more green tea and fish

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.540
A study of 40 500 Japanese people found that

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.480
those who drank 5 or more cups of green tea daily,

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.060
had the lowest risk of dying from heart disease.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.280
As well, those with a diet rich in Omega-3s from fish

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.120
lived an extra 2.2 years

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.280
The world health organization recommends at least

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.760
150 minutes per week of exercise,

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.940
potentially adding 4 years to your life.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.440
This could be either swimming or even... shopping?

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.920
A Taiwanese study found that those who shop daily,

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.500
even if they didn't buy anything,

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.480
lowered their risk of death by 23% to 28%

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.220
Also, have sex,

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.320
One study found that men who had sex only

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.660
once a month, had a 45% higher risk of heart disease

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.060
than those had sex 2 to 3 times a week.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.300
When it comes to sleeping, a long term study

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.760
found that men who got less than 6 hours a night

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.840
were 4 times more likely to die over the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.460
14 year period of the study.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.840
With this in mind, it's important to be realistic

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.680
literally.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:05.820
A German study found that those

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.080
who overestimate their future happiness

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.980
have a higher risk of death compared to

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:12.000
thier peers, who predicted a darker future.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.000
People who identify as Hispanic live an average

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.620
live an average of 2.5 years longer

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.780
than the average American.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.260
Researchers hypothesize that values of

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.740
family togetherness provides a longevity boost.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.980
A polish study found that dads of girls

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.740
live 74 weeks longer than average

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.000
than fathers of sons.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.340
And if your a women,

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.520
be more like BeyoncÃ© and hope for twins.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.480
New research has discovered that having twins

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.320
could be an evolution adaptation

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.060
where healthy moms pass on double

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.280
the genes at once

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.420
And these moms are also known to live longer.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.940
When it comes to planning your life,

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.040
get married, a Danish study of gay men

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.240
found that those who were married

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.700
had lower mortality rates.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.940
But, don't get married to the wrong person

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.280
Another study of 1700 married adults found that

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.880
the more a coupled argued,

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.040
the worse their health.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.860
Don't force for retirement, as the

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.300
Harvard longevity project

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.340
found that those who have satisfying cariers

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.360
and continued to work into their 70s

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.740
made it to older ages.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.960
And, just throw a pet in there as well.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.080
Research shows that both cat and dog owners

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.600
tend to live longer than those without.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.060
Even if you havn't been living healthy so far,

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.440
it's never too late to start.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.560
A study found that taking on

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.400
healthy habits like: eating good food,

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.540
exercise, meditation and support from

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.500
friends and family

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.620
can increase the length of your telomeres,

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.660
the caps on the end of your chromosomes that

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:22.740
that fray as we age.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.880
So, get started with all these tips, and

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.460
start prepping for the 100 year-old birthday bash

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.160
Special thanks to 23andMe for sponsoring this video.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.680
If you've ever wanted to understand your own DNA

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.780
and see where regions of the world

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:34.980
your ancestors come from,

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.720
or, how your DNA influences

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.960
physical traits and health,

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:38.840

[appears on screen]

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.520
We've tried it ourselves,

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.320
and found out that Greg has a lot of Neanderthan DNA

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.940
while Mitch found out why he likes pizza so much.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.060
All you have to do is spit in a tube, and they'll

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.160
analyze your 23 pairs of chromosomes.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.660
(Which is where the name comes from.)

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:54.680
