00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:01.650
guys guys guys
did you hear?

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.000
THERE’S FOUR NEW ELEMENTS.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.700
Dang it, now I have to change my shower curtain.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.309
Hey guys Julia here for DNews
Main

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:16.110
This week the The International Union of Pure
and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) announced that

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.130
four new elements will be joining the other
114 on the periodic table of elements.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:27.350
The addition of elements 113, 115, 117 and
118 means the seventh row or period is now

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:28.350
complete!

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.749
They still don’t have proper names yet,
they’re just called by their numbers.

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:35.050
So where did these as yet unnamed elements
come from?

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.150
Scientists from Lawrence Livermore laboratory
in California and the Riken institute in Japan

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.010
smashed atoms together in particle accelerators
and these new elements were created when the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.260
two nuclei fused.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.440
But the new elements existed only for a fraction
of a second.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.350
Then they decayed into isotopes of other elements.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.320
Element 113, the one created in Japan, exists
for less than a thousandth of a second before

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.870
it decays into other isotopes, so it’s unlikely
you’ll run into this element anytime soon.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.420
So alright, sweet new elements.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.530
While cool, it probably won’t mean much
for your daily life, yet.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.260
Unless you have to memorize the entire table
in chemistry class, sorry 10th graders.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.080
But for science, it could be huge.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.540
Scientists have been searching for the elusive
“island of stability," which according to

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.590
a theory by Nobel laureate Glenn Seaborg is
a stable element with just the right number

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.060
of protons and neutrons.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.870
And these new elements might be getting scientists
closer to the island of stability.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:33.390
You see, most heavy elements, ones with more
than 113 protons like these new ones, only

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.590
exist for a short amount of time.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.120
That’s because the force of the positive
charges of their protons is too strong and

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.090
the nucleus is pushed and pulled apart in
a fraction of a second.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.950
But just like atoms become stable when their
outer electron shells are full, some researchers,

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.390
like Seaborg, believe that if a nuclei has
a certain number of proteins arranged in just

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.510
the right way, the element would be stable,
it could last.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.090
If we can create this theoretical stable element
it could be used to build things we haven’t

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.600
even imagined yet!

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.800
Even the effort of doing so, teaches scientists
"a tremendous amount of just basic nuclear

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.800
physics."

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.799
According to Seaborg, the magic number to
hit is 114 protons and 184 neutrons.

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:17.430
And after 30 years of trying, Seaborg’s
mentee Ken Moody finally hit the sweet spot

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.790
by slamming together plutonium and calcium
which briefly created a new element.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.519
Unfortunately, while the element, now called
flerovium, or Fl has 114 protons it doesn’t

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:31.879
have the needed 184 neutrons, and so it fell
apart too quickly.

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:35.920
Element 117, has been heralded as a possible
“shore to the island of stability”.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.329
Five years ago, A U.S.–Russian team first
created it at the Joint Institute for Nuclear

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:41.329
Research in Dubna, Russia.

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:45.599
Described in a journal Physical Review Letters,
this new element has a half-life of about

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.989
50-thousandths of a second.

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.129
Which means in that short of a time, half
the element will decay into other isotopes

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:59.450
like lawrencium-266, which had 103 protons
and 163 neutrons, a combination never seen

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.450
before.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.989
This lawrencium-266 even lasted a long time
for an isotope, with a half life of 11 hours.

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.049
Because of this, one of the lead authors said
“Perhaps we are at the shore of the island

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:12.049
of stability.”

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.309
So, maybe, science is one step closer to creating
a new element which we could use in ways we

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:17.309
haven’t even dreamed of.

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:18.309
And though we’re not there yet…we’re
getting closer.

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:19.309
It’s clear more research is needed.

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:20.970
There’s no theoretical limit to how big
elements can get!

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.939
One day scientists might just start filling
out the elusive 8th row!

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:26.659
So don’t change your shower curtain just
yet.

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:28.799
so what happens now with these new elements?

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.849
What happens when new elements are added to
the periodic table?

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:36.370
There is trial and error in science constantly
but what did it really take to perfect the

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.249
gold standard tool that hangs in every chemistry
classroom?

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:42.499
