00:00:02.377 --> 00:00:03.712
All right, gentlemen,
today you will be competing

00:00:03.712 --> 00:00:06.297
in our san mai challenge.

00:00:06.297 --> 00:00:07.716
So on your anvils,
there's a cloth.

00:00:07.716 --> 00:00:08.800
Go ahead and lift that up.

00:00:11.594 --> 00:00:13.722
Those are high-carbon
drill bits.

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:17.308
And there's a soft steel
billet inside that box.

00:00:17.308 --> 00:00:21.312
The san mai challenge is forging
blades in your signature styled

00:00:21.312 --> 00:00:24.941
by sandwiching soft steel
around a hardenable steel

00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:26.067
core and edge.

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:32.407
TIM: I am in so much trouble
(LAUGHING) right now.

00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:35.660
I have never, ever messed
with the drill bits.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.495
Just getting those
straightened out

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:38.913
and getting them
into a billet is

00:00:38.913 --> 00:00:40.832
going to be a challenge enough.

00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:42.083
I'm in trouble.

00:00:42.083 --> 00:00:43.710
All right, bladesmiths,
grab your steel.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.588
Your 10-minute design
window starts now.

00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:50.467
I'm going to go to my standard
go-to blade, which is a seax.

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:52.719
As far as chopping-- it's going
to have some weight to it.

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.304
And as far as slicing--

00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:55.972
if I put the right edge to
it, the right angle on it,

00:00:55.972 --> 00:00:58.641
she'll slice just great.

00:00:58.641 --> 00:01:01.394
Bladesmiths, the
design period is closed.

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:04.773
Your three-hour forge
time starts now.

00:01:04.773 --> 00:01:07.442
[music playing]

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.405
- Eeny-meeny-miney, right?
- Yeah.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.118
So there's Tim.

00:01:17.118 --> 00:01:18.119
This is what I like to see.

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.496
He's cleaning up his steel.

00:01:19.496 --> 00:01:21.498
He's going to get
some very clean welds.

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:24.334
TIM: I'm cleaning up, simply
because if you don't, then

00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:26.002
you run the risk of
getting some inclusions

00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:28.922
in there when you actually
go to heat it up and weld it.

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:30.924
Just one little
spot's all it takes.

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:33.176
Just mig welded my
first billet together

00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:34.636
out of those drill bits.

00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:35.720
That's honestly the first
time I'd ever gotten

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.763
to play with a mig welder.

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:37.806
Those things are pretty cool.

00:01:37.806 --> 00:01:39.516
If I can win it, I'm buying one.

00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:41.601
This forge here has
so much more than I

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:42.936
have (LAUGHING) at my own.

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:44.437
I don't have a hydraulic press.

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:46.064
I don't have a power hammer.

00:01:46.064 --> 00:01:47.982
I'm used to doing
everything by hand.

00:01:47.982 --> 00:01:51.069
That could be my Achilles
heel, I don't know.

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:53.947
(YELLING) Bladesmiths, you
only have two hours remaining

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:55.698
to finish your blades.

00:01:55.698 --> 00:01:58.576
We hit that hour mark,
and I'm feeling like--

00:01:58.576 --> 00:02:00.245
where did I slow down?

00:02:00.245 --> 00:02:02.997
My billet is thicker than I
thought it was going to be.

00:02:02.997 --> 00:02:05.041
And so it's just taking
its own sweet time

00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:07.168
getting to that temperature
where I can start moving it.

00:02:07.168 --> 00:02:08.127
Come on!

00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:09.087
Come on, come on, come on.

00:02:09.087 --> 00:02:10.505
That clock on the wall--

00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:14.175
it's like having a ton
sitting on your head.

00:02:14.175 --> 00:02:17.387
I'm behind the eight
ball on this one.

00:02:17.387 --> 00:02:20.515
Tim's working that seax
tip into his blade now.

00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:24.060
I got the bevels rough-forged,
and the handle's in there.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.562
Wish it was a little
bit wider on the tip.

00:02:25.562 --> 00:02:27.188
Thought I was going to
have at least a half hour

00:02:27.188 --> 00:02:29.149
to address anything
that I wanted to.

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:31.025
I don't have that time anymore.

00:02:31.025 --> 00:02:32.694
(YELLING) 10
minutes, bladesmiths.

00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:35.697
TIM: I've got to get this
blade heated up and quenched.

00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:37.115
- Oh no!
- Yes!

00:02:37.115 --> 00:02:39.075
Look, Tim is in the oil.

00:02:39.075 --> 00:02:41.911
Tim is our first
smith to quench.

00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:43.162
I'm really surprised by that.

00:02:43.162 --> 00:02:44.747
So far, so good.

00:02:44.747 --> 00:02:55.341
WIL WILLIS: (YELLING) 10,
9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:57.343
Bladesmiths, drop your tools.

00:02:57.343 --> 00:02:59.762
This forging round is over.

00:02:59.762 --> 00:03:00.680
[applause]

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.056
[interposing voices]

00:03:02.056 --> 00:03:03.474
Damn!

00:03:03.474 --> 00:03:05.268
WIL WILLIS: Bladesmiths,
it's time for the judges

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:07.395
to take a closer
look at your work.

00:03:07.395 --> 00:03:08.730
Alan, you're up first.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.566
Please present your
work to the judges.

00:03:11.566 --> 00:03:12.817
BEN ABBOTT: I really
enjoyed watching

00:03:12.817 --> 00:03:14.235
you do your forge welds.

00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:15.528
Everything seemed
to be going well,

00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:16.863
and then something
must have happened.

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:18.364
Because this is really thin.

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:20.158
For a coconut chop, I
might have wanted it just

00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:21.743
a little bit thicker than that.

00:03:21.743 --> 00:03:25.580
All right, Ed, please present
your work to the judges.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.541
Well, Ed, I like where
you're heading with this knife.

00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:30.126
I like the shape.

00:03:30.126 --> 00:03:33.671
But I mean, there's deep
fissures on the top here.

00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:36.507
And I'm not 100% sure
that it's welded.

00:03:36.507 --> 00:03:37.926
There's almost
rattling in there.

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:39.510
(WHISPERING) Yeah, well.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.388
WIL WILLIS: All
right, Tim, you're up.

00:03:42.388 --> 00:03:44.182
DAVID BAKER: I liked where
you were going with this.

00:03:44.182 --> 00:03:46.893
But I would have loved to
have seen that peak being

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:49.979
up here another three-quarters
of an inch to really give

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:51.481
it that brokeback seax look.

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:54.817
If you move forward, try
not to lose too much mass.

00:03:54.817 --> 00:03:57.487
One thing I'm not a huge
fan of is this handle.

00:03:57.487 --> 00:03:59.697
It's a little small for my hand.

00:03:59.697 --> 00:04:01.282
Be interesting to see
if there's anything

00:04:01.282 --> 00:04:03.159
that can be done there.

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:07.497
But all in all, it's a
solidly welded piece.

00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:10.083
Well done.

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:13.169
Bladesmiths, the judges
deliberation is complete,

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:14.921
and they've made
their final decision.

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:16.297
It's time for one of
you to leave the forge.

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:23.721
The bladesmith leaving
the forge is Ed.

00:04:23.721 --> 00:04:25.556
Your blade did not make the cut.

00:04:25.556 --> 00:04:26.891
David Baker is going
to tell you why.

00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:29.185
Ed, I really appreciate
all the work you

00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:31.270
did to set up for that weld.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.315
But with that material being
so thin, some of those welds

00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:35.984
are questionable.

00:04:35.984 --> 00:04:38.653
And all four of our blades,
yours is the least finished.

00:04:38.653 --> 00:04:41.197
And that's why we're
letting you go.

00:04:41.197 --> 00:04:46.244
Ed, please
surrender your blade.

00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:49.664
This experience was
the heat in my life

00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:51.499
I needed to forge
myself into a better

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:53.293
person and a better knifemaker.

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:55.253
It may have saved my life.

00:04:55.253 --> 00:04:57.588
I'll never stop making knives.
