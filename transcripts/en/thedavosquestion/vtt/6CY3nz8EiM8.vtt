00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.240
FEMALE NEWS REPORTER &gt;&gt; The main question
that Davos leaders are asking themselves is

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.430
how can global growth be restored in 2009.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:16.730
MALE 1 &gt;&gt; Hmmm. How can global growth be restored
in 2009? [scratches chin]

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:23.260
MALE 2 &gt;&gt; The global crisis our generation
is facing is very profound and it is very,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.670
very dangerous, indeed, because it is going
to touch every aspect of our lives.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.460
MALE 3 &gt;&gt; According to people's view, or at
least to YouTube's poll, anyways, people don't

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.700
feel optimistic about the economy. If people
perceive the economy of being bad, then the

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.190
economy is going to go bad. The investors
are going to be tying their pockets, no more

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.670
investments. People are going to be tying
their pockets, no more spending. You know,

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.710
companies are not going to be hiring if they're
not making any money or getting any investments.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.110
When will this economy be restored? When people
have faith again.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.100
FEMALE &gt;&gt; This seems to be a recurring theme
throughout the people I talk to and I believe

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.910
a seed of worriness and fear of the year ahead
has been planted. And, in my opinion, it will

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.909
take more than a year, and a few changes on
the interest rate market to remove this lack

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.729
of confidence that has been ingrained.

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.459
MALE 4 &gt;&gt; We should understand that the economy
is cyclic, meaning that this, there are periods

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:18.270
of growing and periods of decreasing.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.869
MALE 5 &gt;&gt; With regards to the economy I don't
have any one solution. I don't think anybody

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:30.520
has one solution-ah-um-there will always be
cause for debate-um-with regards to any solution.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.490
MALE 6 &gt;&gt; Whether-maybe this year-if this
year, will be the year that we actually bottom

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:43.060
out in which people like you, government officials,
industry leaders can work with everyday Joe's

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.060
like me.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.099
MALE 7 &gt;&gt; If global growth could be restored
in 2009, that would be a miracle. I believe

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:52.979
modifying the date to 2010 would be more adequate.

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.659
MALE 8 &gt;&gt; [Background music] What we need
[holds up a hammer] are the proper tools.

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:09.869
Using the improper tools can lead this recession
into a depression. Improper tools such as

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.920
increase in taxes, protectionist trade barriers
and contraction of the money supply.
