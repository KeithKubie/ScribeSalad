00:00:02.269 --> 00:00:03.203
Okay.

00:00:03.337 --> 00:00:05.272
I can't make heads
or tails of this.

00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:06.740
What is this for?

00:00:06.874 --> 00:00:08.275
Oh, I got that for
biking on the sidewalk,

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:10.511
but because I hadn't
paid my last ticket

00:00:10.644 --> 00:00:11.812
for biking on
the sidewalk--

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:13.614
I gotta tell ya, this
is all a mess,

00:00:13.714 --> 00:00:16.116
'cause none of this is
necessary or helpful.

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:21.188
Oh, come on, Killian Casey,
C.P.A., I didn't know!

00:00:21.288 --> 00:00:23.290
Oh, I didn't know,
Killian.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.993
My final question-- do
you have any dependents?

00:00:26.093 --> 00:00:32.399
Uh, I have a lot of
independence, but, um--

00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:35.302
I guess I have people
who depend on me, too.

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:38.705
So, no?
Correct.

00:00:40.274 --> 00:00:41.608
I think I almost
got this.

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:42.976
Got what?

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.582
I think it's, like, some sort
of rocket ship or something.

00:00:48.682 --> 00:00:50.217
It's my family.

00:00:50.317 --> 00:00:51.985
This magic eye
is your family?

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:53.654
It's a regular
photograph.

00:00:53.787 --> 00:00:57.457
I don't know, man.
I don't care if you
believe me or not.

00:00:59.393 --> 00:01:01.428
Your refund
comes to $52.

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:03.063
Cha-chang,
cha-chang!

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:04.865
(Killian)
It's combined
State and Federal.

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:08.669
My fee is $125
for the day.
What?

00:01:08.802 --> 00:01:11.572
I'm giving you more
than I'm getting back?

00:01:11.705 --> 00:01:14.074
That's illegal.
It's not illegal.

00:01:14.174 --> 00:01:15.709
You're paying me to do
your taxes for you.

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:17.978
Yeah, but I'm not
gonna go negative

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:19.813
for my taxes
to get done.

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:21.281
I shouldn't have done
them in the first place.

00:01:21.415 --> 00:01:23.617
You know what? I think
we're done here.

00:01:23.717 --> 00:01:27.087
Why don't you take
your garbage...

00:01:27.154 --> 00:01:28.722
and mail it
out yourself.

00:01:28.856 --> 00:01:30.090
You're not gonna
mail it?

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.758
I thought this was
a one-stop shop.

00:01:31.892 --> 00:01:34.561
I came here
for the stamps.

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:37.331
I see it,
it's your family.

00:01:37.464 --> 00:01:38.365
Get outta here.
I got it.

00:01:38.532 --> 00:01:40.100
Get outta here!

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.969
Who yells?

00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:43.937
Go! Go!

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:45.906
My purse!
Go!

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:47.541
Get out!
Get outta here!

00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:50.010
Give me that!
