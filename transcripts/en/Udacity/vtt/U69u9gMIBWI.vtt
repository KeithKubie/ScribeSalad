00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is this trajectory.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Remember the apple will spend the same time in the air regardless of how fast you throw it,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
if you're throwing horizontally,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and so doubling the horizontal velocity will just double the distance it covers,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
making this the best answer.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It seems like we still have a problem.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
None of these trajectories look like they're even close to orbiting.

00:00:18.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Let's zoom out a bit.
