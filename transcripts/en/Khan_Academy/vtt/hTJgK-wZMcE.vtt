00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.010
Let's think about whether
each of these expressions

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.022
produce rational or
irrational numbers.

00:00:06.022 --> 00:00:07.730
And just as a reminder,
a rational number

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.680
is one-- so if you have
a rational number x,

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.710
it can be expressed as the
ratio of two integers, m and n.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.140
And if you have an irrational
number, this cannot happen.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.120
So let's think
about each of these.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.250
So 9 is clearly a
rational number.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.230
You can express 9 as
9/1, 18/2, or 27/3.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.410
So it can clearly be expressed
as the ratio of two integers.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.445
But what about the
square root of 45?

00:00:37.445 --> 00:00:39.070
So let's think about
that a little bit.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.530
Square root of 45.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.310
That's the same thing as the
square root of 9 times 5,

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.180
which is the same thing
as the square root

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.430
of 9 times the square root of 5.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.730
The principal root
of 9 is 3, so it's

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.960
3 times the square root of 5.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.420
So this is going to be 9 plus
3 times the square root of 5.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.000
So the square root
of 5 is irrational.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.280
You're taking the square root
of a non-perfect square right

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.100
over here.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.350
Irrational.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.395
3 is rational, but the product
of a rational and an irrational

00:01:10.395 --> 00:01:12.060
is still going to be irrational.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.750
So that's going
to be irrational.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.630
And then you're taking
an irrational number

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.030
and you're adding 9 to it.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.760
You're adding a
rational number to it.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.800
But you add a rational
to an irrational,

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.040
and you're still going
to have an irrational.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.530
So this whole thing
is irrational.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.970
Now let's think about this
expression right over here.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.470
Well, the numerator
can be rewritten

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.400
as the square root of 9 times
5 over 3 times the square root

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.320
of 5.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.236
Well, that's the same
thing as the square root

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:47.300
of 9 times the square root of
5 over 3 times the square root

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.230
of 5.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.200
Well, that's the same thing as
3 times the square root of 5

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.420
over 3 times the
square root of 5.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.890
Well, that's just
going to be equal to 1.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.350
Or you could view it as 1/1.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.430
And 1 is clearly
a rational number.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.880
You could write it as 1/1,
2/2, 3/3, really any integer

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.070
over itself.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.245
So this is going to be rational.

00:02:11.245 --> 00:02:13.370
Now, let's do this last
expression right over here.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.440
3 times the principal root of 9.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.280
Well, what's the
principal root of 9?

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.000
Well, it's 3.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.490
So this is going to be 3
times 3, which is equal to 9.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.280
And we've already
talked about the fact

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.880
that 9 can clearly be
expressed as the ratio of two

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:34.933
integers-- 9/1, 27/3, 45/5, all
different ways of expressing 9.
