00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This unit is about probability,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
which is a tool for dealing with uncertainty.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Once you understand probability,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
you'll be able to tackle a much broader range of problems than you could

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
with programs that don't understand probability.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Often when we have problems with uncertainty, we're dealing with search problems.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Recall, in a search problem, we are in a current state.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
There are other states that we can transition into,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and we're trying to achieve some goal,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
but we can't do it all in one step.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We have to paste together a sequence of steps.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
In doing that, we're building up a search frontier that we're continuing to explore from.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Now, uncertainty can come into play in two ways.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
One, we can be uncertain about the current state.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Rather than knowing exactly where we are,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
it may be that we start off in one of four possible states and

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
all we know is that we're somewhere in there, but we're not sure exactly where we are.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The other place uncertainty can come in is when we apply an action,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
say this action here--action A--it may be that we don't get to

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
one specific state but, rather, we're uncertain as to what the action will do,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and we might end up in this state or this state or this state

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
instead of the one that we were aiming at.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And so we'll see techniques for dealing with both of these types of uncertainty.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Now, one place where people are used to dealing with uncertainty

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
is in playing games that employ dice.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And that's what we're going to deal with.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
In particular, we're going to play a dice game which is called Pig.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I don't know why the game is called Pig.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I can guarantee no porcine creatures were harmed in the creation of this unit.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Here's how the game works.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
There are two players, although you could play with more.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
The players take turns, and on his turn a player has the option

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
to roll the dice--a single die--as often as he wants or to hold--to stop rolling.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And the object of the game is to score a certain number of points.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
We're going to say 50 points; 100 is more common, but 50 will be easier

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
on the Udacity servers in terms of the amount of computation required.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And so it's my turn, and we have a score.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So here's a scoreboard; we'll have players with the imaginative names

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
of player 0 and player 1.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And the score starts off 0 to 0.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Now there's another part of the scoreboard that is not part of the player's score.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
We'll call that the pending score.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Let's say it's my turn.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I pick up the die, I roll it, and let's say I get a 5.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Then 5 goes into the pending score,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
but I don't score any points yet.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Now it's my turn again.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Do I roll or do I hold--stop rolling?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Let's say I want to roll again.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000
This time I get a 2, so I add 2 to the pending score; I get 7.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Let's say I roll again.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
I'm lucky. I get a 6. I add 6 to the pending; I get 13.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And I'm going great, so I roll again, and this time I get a 1.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And a 1 is special.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
A 1 is called a pig out, and when you roll a pig out it means

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
you lose all the pending points, and for your hand you score

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
not this total, but just the 1.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
So my score would be just the 1.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Now the other player, player number 1, goes.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Let's say player number 1 says, "I'm going to roll," gets a 3.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
"I'm going to roll again," gets a 4.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
"I'm going to roll again," gets a 5.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.000
So now we have 12 in the pending, and now player number 1 says,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
"I think I've had enough; I'm going to hold,"

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and that means we take these points from the pending, the 12 points,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
put them up on the board for player 1's score.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And now player 1's turn ends, and it's player 0's turn.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
So your turn continues until you either hold or pig out,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and your score for the turn is the sum of your rolls, if you didn't pig out,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000
if you decided to hold, and the score is just 1 if you pigged out.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And you keep on taking turns until somebody reaches the target--here, 50.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
So that's how the game of Pig works.

00:04:24.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Now let's go to try to describe the game in a form that we can program.
