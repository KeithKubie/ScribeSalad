00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:32.100
- We are the paradoxical ape, bipedal,
naked, large-brained, long the master of

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:39.980
fire, tools, and language, but still
trying to understand ourselves. Aware that

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:48.830
death is inevitable, yet filled with
optimism. We grow up slowly. We hand down

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:56.110
knowledge. We empathize and deceive.
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:03.510
understanding of the past. CARTA brings
together experts from diverse disciplines

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:11.320
to exchange insights on who we are and how
we got here, an exploration made possible

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.206
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:02:17.344 --> 00:02:21.710
- [Potts] There are many fundamental
problems in the study

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:27.682
of human evolution, an immense
array of really intriguing questions,

00:02:27.682 --> 00:02:30.999
in part because the
evolutionary journey has

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:39.770
involved an astonishing transformation.
One way of looking at this transformation

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.970
is through a pairing of slides. I thought
I'd start with the raciest one first but

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:50.270
also the most endangering in some ways.
But it poses, this pairing of slides I'm

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:56.100
gonna show you, poses a question, and
it's, how is it that our ancestry

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.780
included, and in imagined way
in this reconstruction, dilemmas

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:09.560
and survival challenges, such as this? And
then in our species that we can present

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.030
ourselves with a survival challenge like
this. How is that kind of transformation

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:23.330
even possible? Ed White's space walk, the
first human to take a walk in space, how

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.790
is it, if, in fact, evolutionary process
tethered our species through a change over

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:37.510
time, tethered our species to inhuman
possibilities and mentality and society to

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:45.580
a particular ancestral habitat and to
particular conditions of life? How can

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.090
that transformation have taken place?
Another pairing of slides that I think

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.960
captures this is ...can be expressed in
this way. The oldest known stone tool

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:04.150
tradition, the old one dating back to
about 2.6 million years ago, and the

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.750
question that's posed here is how is our
evolutionary ...how is it that our

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:15.990
evolutionary journey and technology go
from something like this to something like

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:22.975
this?. And as you can read there, this is
space debris that is encircling the Earth.

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:30.054
Right there, the entire planet has become
an archaeological sight. And so in many

00:04:30.054 --> 00:04:37.076
different ways, our species resides on a
human altered planet. Well, in seeking to

00:04:37.076 --> 00:04:44.137
understand transformation such as this, we
run right up against the fundamental

00:04:44.137 --> 00:04:50.272
scientific challenge of seeing ourselves
as a phenomenon of nature. And I think

00:04:50.272 --> 00:04:56.975
that sadly, the folkways in which we see
our species often sees in the science homo

00:04:56.975 --> 00:05:01.915
sapiens almost as an aberration of nature,
and the dichotomies, the traditional

00:05:01.915 --> 00:05:10.759
dichotomies, line up in a series of false
oppositions. Human versus nature. Cultural

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:19.803
versus natural. Learning versus instance.
Even human versus animal. And it's

00:05:19.803 --> 00:05:26.546
especially that ladder dichotomy that
highlights the fosted division that occurs

00:05:26.546 --> 00:05:32.325
in this particular perspective. Now human
evolution is the period

00:05:32.325 --> 00:05:38.763
I've been looking at so far in this first
several talks, namely the past six or

00:05:38.763 --> 00:05:44.156
seven million years of Earth's history,
where the baseline adaptations and the

00:05:44.156 --> 00:05:49.908
initial possibilities of our species
emerged in ancestors who are no longer

00:05:49.908 --> 00:05:54.646
around. And so one way to pursue the
question in how the accumulation of

00:05:54.646 --> 00:06:00.460
adaptations occurred over time is to
examine the environmental context of that

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:05.550
entire time period. And so data like this,
which have been shown in the previous two

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:12.690
talks, and also is shown on the front of
your programs, is the oxygen isotope curve

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:18.910
showing changes and the trends and
fluctuation and ocean temperature and

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:25.060
global ice volume. It's an iconic diagram
of paleo-climatology, and it shows up the

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:31.500
past six million years corresponding with
the period of human evolutionary history

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:37.450
have been one of the most dramatic periods
of climate oscillation of the Cenozoic era

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:44.300
of the past 65 million years. As Peter
deMenocal showed in his talk,

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:51.590
paleo-climate records express at least two
signals, the overall trend as well as the

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:58.310
variability. And up to about, I would say,
20 years ago, nearly every student in the

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:04.030
study of human evolution considered the
variability as simply noise in the

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:09.870
all-important trend toward a cooler and
dryer Earth. It was the direction of

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:15.710
change, the direction of change, the onset
of grassland dominated savannas, and in

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:22.720
East Africa or Africa in general, and of
Ice Age conditions in higher latitudes,

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:27.780
that was thought to be the signal, the
signal that elicited the emergence of

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:33.680
uniquely human adaptations. Yet all of the
environmental records also show periods of

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:42.630
strong instability of amplitude variations
in, as they were switches between arid and

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:50.110
moist and between cool and warm. Now among
many factors that have an influence on

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:54.960
Earth's climate system, Earth's orbital
dynamics certainly are one of them as

00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:04.050
expressed in this figure. We live on a
spinning planet, who's axis of rotation is

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:09.320
tilted, and therefore, there are
variations, fluctuations in the amount of

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:13.700
solar radiation that hits the Earth at
different times of the year and different

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:20.220
places on Earth. And so we see these three
variables represented here of

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:25.510
eccentricity, the shape of the Earth's
orbit around the sun, the tilt of the

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:30.210
Earth's axis also varies eccentricity, the
shape of the Earth's orbit, the first

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:37.370
factor, goes from a more circular orbit to
a more oval or elliptical orbit, the tilt

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:43.480
of the Earth's axis of rotation varies,
and also there is this wobble in the

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:51.540
Earth's axis of rotation that relates to a
precision. Well, when you look at African

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:55.210
climate, and really climate all over the
globe, but African climate is strongly

00:08:55.210 --> 00:09:02.050
influenced by variation in solar
insulation. And looking at two major, two

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:07.350
of those variables, it's the interaction
of orbital precision, which have cycles of

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:13.543
19,000 and 23,000 years approximately, an
eccentricity the shape's of the Earth's

00:09:13.543 --> 00:09:17.385
orbit around the sun,
which has periodicities

00:09:17.385 --> 00:09:23.588
of about 100,000 years and
about 413,000 years.

00:09:24.375 --> 00:09:32.187
You put those four wavy lines together,
four basically sine curves together, and

00:09:32.187 --> 00:09:35.846
the interaction of them shows that there
is this interacting ...there are these

00:09:35.846 --> 00:09:41.747
alternating phases of high and low climate
variability in tropical Africa. Peter

00:09:41.747 --> 00:09:47.314
deMenocal has been instrumental in helping
me to understand this as we got together

00:09:47.314 --> 00:09:53.214
in a project a number of years ago. And so
what we've been able to do, and this is

00:09:53.214 --> 00:09:58.361
going to come out in the publication soon,
is that we've been able to label according

00:09:58.361 --> 00:10:04.170
to very specific intervals of changes
between the high climate variability times

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:09.490
and the low climate variability times of
labeling back through time, back over the

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:15.090
last five million years we've been able to
do this. The highs and the low. The times

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:21.070
of strong instability in East African
climate, where the amplitude of dry and

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:26.420
wet were exacerbated or magnified versus
times of greater stability, the low

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:34.590
periods. And what we've been able to show
is that the times of record that Peter has

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:41.080
studied, for example, the dust records as
well as the wet-dry cycles that are

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:46.640
recorded in the Mediterranean relating to
eastern and northeast African climate,

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:51.740
support this alternation and this pattern
of division between high and low climate

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:57.550
variability. Well, the same paper, which
will come out later this year, also

00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:04.360
explores well, did the places in East
Africa, which where early humans lived,

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:09.970
where we find fossils and stone tools, do
those also see fluctuations of this sort?

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:15.400
And it turns out that all of the really
prolonged of high climates variability, we

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:22.360
see also amplification in landscape
variability in East African sedimentary

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:26.430
basins. So for example, this place with
the almost unpronounceable name of

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:32.398
Olorgesailie in southern Kenya, where I've
been working for the last 30 years, we see

00:11:32.398 --> 00:11:39.584
that between 350,000 and 50,000 years ago,
which was the high to prolonged tide

00:11:39.584 --> 00:11:45.583
labeled H2 in the previous diagram, that
time period that we see the landscape

00:11:45.583 --> 00:11:49.973
changing in amazing ways of down cutting
of the basin and then the basin filling up

00:11:49.973 --> 00:11:55.780
with sediments compared with earlier in
time. And so we think that these are

00:11:55.780 --> 00:12:01.370
climate, under climate control, these vast
changes in landscape. And we see this for

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:08.630
all of the other prolonged high
variability itervals. Well, I wondered

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:12.570
whether in this prolonged high variability
intervals, what happened? Was there

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:16.100
anything interesting that happened in
human evolutionary history? And you can

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:21.620
see the time scale of five million years
on the left. And what I've recorded here

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:28.760
are the eight, that is the 25% longest
periods of high climate variability and

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:32.900
the numbers that we've assigned them in
this paper to come out. And we thought,

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:37.160
"Okay, well, what goes on here? What can
we tell from the fossil and archaeological

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:41.040
record?" It turns out that almost
everything that's interesting in African

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:46.350
human evolution is concentrated in those
periods of high climate variability. FAD.

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:51.200
It's a strange word, but it just means
first appearance date where a fossil or an

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:56.640
archaeological piece of evidence shows us
the beginning of a particular lineage and

00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:02.980
our evolutionary tree or behavior. And so
for Australopithecus, of all the major

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:09.120
genera in our evolutionary tree,
Australopithecus and homo and

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:13.410
Paranthropus, are concentrated in a period
of high predicted high climate

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:19.160
variability. Also that of homo sapiens at
the top of the chart there. And also the

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:24.920
origin of every single major technological
and behavioral transition in human

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:30.440
evolutionary history is focused in one of
these prolonged high climate variability

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:34.740
intervals. Now one thing that could be
easily criticized about this is that yeah,

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:38.870
but new fossils are found all the time and
there are going to be new finds that are

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:44.240
made. Well, that happened about a month
and a half ago with a fossil jaw from

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:49.580
Ethiopia that repositioned the origin of
the genus homo. Well it turns out that it

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:55.930
repositioned it in the next earliest, in
the oldest period of high climate

00:13:55.930 --> 00:14:01.090
variability. Now I'm not saying that this
is proof, but it's nice to see a robust

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:06.500
predictive model about this relationship
of African human evolutionary history and

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:13.110
these periods of high climate variability.
We'see what happens next with the the

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:17.550
discoveries. And so we've also seen in our
evolutionary tree that we used to have the

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:22.470
march of hominids going from ape-like to
human-like, and that gave a sense of

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:27.870
inevitability about the existence of
species on Earth. Well, that idea has been

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:33.370
completely discarded, and we see that we
are part of a much more diverse

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:39.100
evolutionary tree. And in the context of
environmental dynamics, as the conditions

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:43.090
of life change with the shifts in
landscape and in food and water and

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:48.380
shelter, it makes sense that new
behavioral possibilities, new adaptations

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:53.460
and ways of life, were at a premium if
they could allow a greater degree of

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:59.930
adjustment in these time periods of very
strong variability in the environment, but

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:07.170
this also means, this also means, since
we're the last bipeds standing, that other

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:11.840
ways of life, prior means of existence,
could not be sustained, and they were

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:17.740
lost. In the light of environmental
dynamics, we can also inspect this

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:23.940
overview of the adaptive history related
to the origin eventually of homo sapiens,

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:29.930
and we can now see these adaptations as
the evolution of behavioral flexibility

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:33.910
and a wider range, the development of a
wider range of adaptive options and being

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:39.430
able to switch strategies, essentially
adaptability in the face of an unstable

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:43.520
world. I don't have time to go through all
of these points certainly, but we can

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:50.040
point out few of them. So for example,
things like a simple stone flaking and

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:55.950
carrying of food and stones across the
landscape associated with the genus homo,

00:15:55.950 --> 00:16:01.170
were ways of being able to buffer the
changing menu of food, food distribution

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:08.190
and food abundance over time during a high
variability interval. The most rapid rate

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:14.030
of increasing brain size relative to body
size. Well, the brain is our organ of

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:18.480
plasticity, one of our organs of
plasticity, and that also becomes more

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:23.050
understandable, not as something that
evolved in a specific narrow set of

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:29.360
environmental and survival conditions, but
in relationship to changing circumstances.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:33.280
Increased cultural diversity and
technological innovation, not, of course,

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:38.030
as a characteristic of our own species and
as multiplied the options, the behavioral

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:46.480
options within our own species. We also
see in this chart the foundations for a

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:53.600
human altered planet, and for example the
changes in technology, control of fire and

00:16:53.600 --> 00:17:00.240
building of shelters, the ...even things
like the moving of complex ...moving of

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:05.710
resources across the landscape. We can see
in the archaeological record, we'll talk

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:11.760
more about that in a moment, and so what
we see is that we have become very good at

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:17.550
surviving by modifying our surroundings,
and that humans, as a result, have spread

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:23.290
worldwide, and so thus we have global
change, global transformation of

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:28.730
landscapes and the consumption of
resources even founded in this early

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:34.050
evolutionary history of human beings. Now
my research team has been working toward

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:40.760
the top of this time tree, about 300,000
years ago and very quickly. These are some

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:46.990
of the things that were occurring in that
period going back to 280,000 years ago,

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:51.080
and remember that's the time period in
Africa of prolonged high climate

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:57.150
variability, and we see the beginning of
innovations. We see increasing innovation,

00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:01.620
wider social networks, trade, the
beginning of awareness of groups that are

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:06.650
distant, far away, that you cannot see,
and yet you're able to have a sense of

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:11.670
values, of valuable rock, like obsidian
rock that was traded over long distance,

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:15.970
complex symbolic activity, complex
thinking and planning. And I would see

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:21.850
this overall as, in an environmental
context, that we examine now in Africa, a

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:26.180
greater capacity to adjust to new
environments. I'm not gonna show you any

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:30.580
more than that other than to say that our
research team is about to extend some of

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:37.420
these traits even further back in time
prior to 300,000 years ago. And so what we

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:44.190
then come up with is that the new theme
and story, the new theme and hallmark of

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:49.860
our evolutionary story, is one of
adaptability, increasing adaptability to

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:55.200
endure change in the environment, to
thrive in novel environments, to spread

00:18:55.200 --> 00:19:00.340
the new habitats, to respond in new ways
to the surrounding. And these are the

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:06.370
characteristics of the genus homo, and
especially embodied in us, homo sapiens.

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:11.480
Final thoughts, the long-term view of
human evolutionary history, the idea of

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:15.760
the inevitability of our species has been
discarded, it's been, I think,

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:20.750
increasingly replaced by an emphasis on
adaptability when human evolution is

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:26.310
framed within the study of
paleo-environments. And finally,

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:33.010
adaptability, according to the definitions
that I just gave, and the demise of ways

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:37.060
of life, have been two sides of the
evolutionary process, and I think the

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:41.980
question ahead for us, is that this is
evolutionary history, but in the cultural

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:46.684
history that is now unfolding, will that
still be the case? Thank you very much.
