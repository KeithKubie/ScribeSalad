00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
One of the things I just want to reemphasize because we mentioned it earlier

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
is the difference between single-sided markets and multi-sided markets.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Now, in single-sided markets the customer is the user and the payer.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
That's a single-sided market. There are no separate users, and there are no separate payers.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
You're it. Congratulations. You're the customer and you're going to pay for it.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
But in multi-sided markets there might be users,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
but they're also might be very separate people who are payers.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The example we keep using is Google,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
because everybody around the world has probably had at one time or another

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
been a Google user.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
When you use the Google search bar you're one side of a multi-sided market.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
You're the user, but you're not the payer. You're not paying for the product.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
But in reality, you're paying implicitly,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
because there is another side.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
The other side are the people using Google Adwords

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
to look for keywords.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
In multi-sided markets the company, your startup,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
typically cares about acquiring a massive amount of users

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and then figuring out how to monetize those users next.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Google decided to go from millions and then tens of millions of users,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and then the keywords came after.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Now, depending on your investors, this might be their strategy.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I tend to prefer that we actually try to look for who the payers are as early as possible,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
but this is a question you might want to ask your investors.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Do we go for lots of users and then say if we get 10 million people

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
the revenues will come?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Or do we want to look at both sides of the market at the same time?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Again, if you're in a physical channel,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
my suggestion is you want to take a look at users and payers simultaneously.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
If you say your business is advertising-based,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
some of the tactics are how do you get to 10 million monthly users?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
How do you become one of the top five websites?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And how much do the payers actually pay?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Now, if you wait 2 years to find this out,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
you might have gotten 10 million of the wrong users.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Your job is not only to talk to the users in a multi-sided market.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
You're job is to get out of the building and talk to the payers.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Because you have a hypothesis, an important one,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
which is how much will those payers pay for the users you think you're collecting.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Guess what?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
If you're wrong, the time to know about it is now, not two years from now,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and it's okay to be wrong,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
because most startups all you have is a series of hypotheses,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and it's really easy to get caught up in the passion that says,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
well, if we get all these people obviously these people will pay us lots of money.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
But as soon as we get out of the building that obviously might turn into maybe not.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
What we want to do is get the facts as quickly as we can

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and then iterate and pivot.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
So, don't worry if your assumptions were wrong here on your revenue model.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
You just want to find it out before you start burning a lot of cash

00:03:10.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and building a lot of value prop around the wrong model.
