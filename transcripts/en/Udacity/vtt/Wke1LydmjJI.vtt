I and j both sort of look right to me. If i is meant to be the first letter

00:00:03.252 --> 00:00:06.143

00:00:06.143 --> 00:00:11.790
letter that we were supposed to include, then that would be 4 which would be o.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.146
Let's try stepping through the last line. When you step past that last line,

00:00:16.146 --> 00:00:18.721
what is the value of text?
