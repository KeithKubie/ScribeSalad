00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.860
[Captions by Y Translator]
Today we're setting up
some box fans to see

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.860
if we can make a
homemade smoke tornado.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.860
Not too long ago,
we took a watermelon

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.100
and we turned it into
a pull-tab smoke grenade.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.100
It worked really well.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.000
I was actually surprised
at how well it worked.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.360
And while it was going off,
I had a thought that I've seen videos

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.500
of people who take a bunch of box fans

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.560
and put them in a circle
with a fire in the middle

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.500
and it makes just this 
fire vortex tornado thing.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.300
It looks really cool.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.620
And I was wondering if you could
do the same thing with smoke.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.160
Well our watermelon did such
a good job of pouring out

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.360
smoke in high volumes and multiple colors.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.680
That I thought we'd try the same
thing with the watermelon.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.100
But this time, we've got 
8 of these box fans

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.600
and we're going to set them up
in a circle around the watermelon

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.020
as it's got the smoke coming out of it.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.200
And see what happens.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.900
I want to see if we get
a smoke vortex similar

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.700
to the fire vortexes that have already seen.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.100
Here's what we've got in mind.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.800
We'll take these 8 box fans,
set them up in a circle

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.212
angled just off center,

00:00:59.372 --> 00:01:02.800
put a watermelon absolutely full
of colored smoke powder in the middle,

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.520
light the smoke,
turn on the fans

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.380
and see what kind of result we get.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.100
Something's weird
with that watermelon.

00:03:02.742 --> 00:03:06.300
With fire vortex videos I've seen,
they actually used a few more fans

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.600
and spaced them out a little bit more.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.800
But fire gets hot enough
that it can actually start

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.300
to melt components in the fans.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.200
This smoke may put off
a little bit of heat,

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.500
but nowhere near that.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.300
So I feel pretty safe keeping it
right next to the watermelon.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.380
When you make a tornado with fire,

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.800
the fire itself is hot enough

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.420
that it really has a lot
of drafting force up.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.500
The heat is pulling those 
flames upward quite a bit.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.800
I think we're probably going to have
a slightly different result than fire.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.100
Rather than the sort of tube shape
that you get with a flame,

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.360
we might get a different shape.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.100
I'm not sure.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.800
All right.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.300
Here we go.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.480
Light the fuse,

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:39.900
quickly turn on 8 fans.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.080
Already got some swirling
just from the few smoke.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.000
It's burning in a circle.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.140
It's also not burning well.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.400
Smoke isn't catching.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.340
The way this is like is burning
in a circle kind of.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.280
It's so weird to me like
the smoke just comes out

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.900
two or three holes at a time 
in which two or three,

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.000
it keeps circling around the watermelon.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.800
That's sort of a cyclone.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.360
Just getting yellow now.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.520
Oh there we go.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.740
Interesting.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.260
That even with the watermelon
lifted up a little bit,

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.440
the smoke still gets drawn all
the way down to the ground.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.900
All right.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.240
Our watermelon smoke bomb

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.840
is well, apparently it's not
completely burned out.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.900
As the smoke burns,
it leaves some

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.560
like oxidized smoke powder

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.380
at the top and that can 
smother what's down below.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.800
So if I stirred that up,
we'd probably get a little bit

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.000
more burning out of it.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.300
All of our watermelon
smoke powder smoke

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.922
is gone up.

00:05:46.922 --> 00:05:48.960
It swirled around in
pretty interesting ways.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.900
I think I was right
that the lack of heat

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.000
raising it up caused it
to swirl around in more

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.200
of a whirlpool style than a tornado style.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.300
But it still looked really neat.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.580
Although there is still one
more thing I want to try.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.920
And that's just to put a little bit
of fuel inside this watermelon,

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.720
and light that with the fans
going and see if we can get

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.880
a little bit of that fire vortex.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:12.080
Haha!

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.660
Fire tornado!

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.120
That works great!

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:17.760
Random fact.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.740
Winds inside of a tornado
can reach up to 300 miles per hour.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.960
That's 480 kilometers per hour.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.280
A little bit of natural breeze
comes in it like ruins it.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:31.680
Fun stuff!

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.100
Smoke whirlpools
and fire tornadoes.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.840
It was interesting to see 
the difference between

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.180
how fire reacts and how smoke reacts,

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.700
and like I said, I think that's
because the fire has the heat

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.360
that's pulling it up so fast.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:43.660
Whereas the smoke,

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.000
while it is warm, it's not so much warmer

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.520
that it's just trying 
to shoot into the sky

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.500
the same way the flames up.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.500
Are there any other things
you want to see us try

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:51.800
with this fan setup?

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.200
I have some ideas of my own

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.700
but I want to hear
your thoughts.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.000
All right guys, we've got time today

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.500
for a couple more question and answers.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.560
So here we go.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.940
First question is from Jeremy Molinari.

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.900
Who asks, what are some
of your biggest problems

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.522
you've come across when having to
build all of these crazy projects?

00:07:10.102 --> 00:07:10.800
Oh let's see.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.660
I would say that the biggest 
problem we run into is that

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:16.800
when we have cool build projects
like we're making something

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.060
to show you how to do it.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.200
A lot of the time there 
aren't any other people

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.502
who have done that project.

00:07:22.502 --> 00:07:24.600
Sometimes we do projects
that have been done

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.340
in other ways and we're just
trying to give our own twist on them.

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:30.340
But when we're really trying to come up
with how to make something from scratch,

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.800
the problem is
that we don't have

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.200
any instructions to follow.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.200
If there were good instructions
out there already,

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.800
then we wouldn't necessarily
be making a video on it.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.380
So all the time we're trying
to show you how to do something

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.600
that we didn't know how to do.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.060
And so it takes a lot of research
and a lot of trial and error

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.540
and sometimes we have
to do multiple prototypes.

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.400
We'll try building something
and it doesn't work

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.400
or only a little bit of it works and so we
have to take the part that does work

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.260
and just build a new one.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.420
And doing that over and over
takes kind of a lot of time.

00:07:58.780 --> 00:07:59.960
And unfortunately,

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.860
I don't have all of the time in the world.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.300
So if things are taking too much 
time, I often have to give up

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.280
on something for a while
and come back to it later.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.700
So that I have time to just go on
and make other projects, other videos,

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.220
other experiments
and stuff like that.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.600
So time restraint is really 
one of the big ones in that

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.740
if I can't find enough information
of how to do something,

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.860
I have to just figure it out
by trial and error myself.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.200
While I like doing that,
it sometimes can end up

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.300
being this big old project for
something that's relatively small.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.200
I don't want to spend three weeks trying

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.840
to figure out how to do something.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.220
That's really only a, it should only be

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.000
a 10 or 15 minute project.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.000
Thank you Jeremy for your question.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.380
I hope I answered it satisfactorily.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.740
Our next question comes
from a user named Tracer,

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.560
who asks, will there be live streaming
or podcast type content?

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.600
Tracers, yes and no.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.660
Yes to some of that.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.600
Podcast type content,
we're not probably

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.500
going to have anything that
really resembles a podcast.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.800
But I think we are going to try
and do more of this type

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.800
of thing where in some videos we
take a little bit of time to talk

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.900
about some other random stuff.

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.900
Things coming up on the channel
would be a good topic.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.760
I think we might get
into that a little bit.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:16.600
I don't think we'll probably going to get
into playing video games on the channel

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.600
or streaming video games.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.000
But I'm not going
to rule it out.

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:22.700
I personally am not very good
at most video games.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:23.400
I've played some.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.580
I've enjoyed some.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.320
But I'm not a big gamer.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:29.000
Sharing some maker tips and like.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.100
That's something I
actually do quite like

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:35.600
is the idea of sharing maker tips
in these after video question

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.400
answer sessions which will like
I'm trying to explain will be

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.362
a little bit more general.

00:09:39.362 --> 00:09:41.080
It won't just be
question and answer.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.300
But we're just getting into it
and figuring out a good flow

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:44.240
for it so far.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:45.900
But that is a great idea

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:49.900
and I am going to start writing 
down tips and ideas I have.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.420
Sometimes I have things that I would
like to share that don't necessarily

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:55.600
fit in a specific project video.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:59.000
But it would be a great idea to just
sort of start making a list of them

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.400
and share them with you
as they come up.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.100
I think,

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:06.100
they would be really good
for me to focus on those.

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.320
I think it would help
me come up with more ideas

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.180
and do better work

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.560
and hopefully it would
help some of you as well.

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.940
Getting to share those ideas
and get them out there.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.720
So thank you Tracer

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:17.040
who also has the handle

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.540
@tracerm6c.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:20.720
Thank you for your question.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.340
Hope I answered that for you.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:23.900
Thanks for tuning in.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.800
Guys there's more for you to see.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.200
The box up at the top
will transport you

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.200
directly to our last video.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.200
You should check that one out.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.920
The other box will show
you what YouTube thinks

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.140
you need to be watching next.

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:33.640
