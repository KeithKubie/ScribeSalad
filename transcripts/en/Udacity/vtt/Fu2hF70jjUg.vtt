Let's wrap up this unit on rational expressions by looking at variation.

00:00:04.477 --> 00:00:08.616
Variation is a concept about relating two or more amounts. For example, if you

00:00:08.616 --> 00:00:12.642
have an hourly wage at a job we can relate the number of hours you work to the

00:00:12.642 --> 00:00:17.360
amount of money you earn from that job. Let's say your current wage is $10 an

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.065
hour and if you work 40 hours in a week, you can make $400. We get this simply

00:00:22.065 --> 00:00:25.910
by multiplying the number of hours we worked. By our current wage. And it turns

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.612
out there's a unique relationship between the wage and our hours. So what do you

00:00:30.612 --> 00:00:35.270
think would happen if you worked more hours? Would you make more money, less

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.943
money, or the same amount?
