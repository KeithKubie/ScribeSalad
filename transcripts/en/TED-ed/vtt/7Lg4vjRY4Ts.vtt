00:00:07.664 --> 00:00:09.605
In the summer of 1963,

00:00:09.605 --> 00:00:14.644
a high school teacher changed the way
the world looked at "The Wizard of Oz."

00:00:14.644 --> 00:00:16.463
His name was Henry Littlefield,

00:00:16.463 --> 00:00:19.375
and he was teaching 
an American history class.

00:00:19.375 --> 00:00:23.995
He'd made it to the late 19th century,
a time called The Gilded Age,

00:00:23.995 --> 00:00:26.486
but he was struggling to keep
his class interested

00:00:26.486 --> 00:00:30.330
in the complex social and economic
issues of the time.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.848
Then one night, while he was reading

00:00:31.848 --> 00:00:34.759
"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"
to his daughters,

00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:36.489
he had an idea.

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.779
In the 1890s, farmers wanted to add silver
to the gold standard

00:00:40.779 --> 00:00:42.810
to put more money in circulation

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.867
and make it easier for farmers to borrow.

00:00:45.867 --> 00:00:50.499
In the book, Dorothy walked to
the Emerald City on the Yellow Brick Road

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:52.539
in her silver shoes.

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:56.388
The movie's ruby red slippers 
started out as silver.

00:00:56.388 --> 00:00:59.780
Silver and gold on the road to prosperity.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.970
L. Frank Baum had published
the book in 1900

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.700
at the height of The Gilded Age,

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.919
and the analogy didn't seem
out of the question.

00:01:07.919 --> 00:01:09.938
No one else had seen these connections,

00:01:09.938 --> 00:01:11.991
but that didn't deter Littlefield.

00:01:11.991 --> 00:01:15.261
He taught his class about The Gilded Age
using the book,

00:01:15.261 --> 00:01:19.430
and soon he and his students were
finding more connections.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.501
For instance, in the late 1890s,

00:01:21.501 --> 00:01:24.661
the U.S. had recently recovered
from the Civil War

00:01:24.661 --> 00:01:26.932
and integrated vast new territories,

00:01:26.932 --> 00:01:30.484
bringing an era of prosperity for some.

00:01:30.484 --> 00:01:34.369
But while industry and finance
in the North and East prospered,

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.701
farmers across the South
and Midwest struggled.

00:01:38.701 --> 00:01:40.714
This led to the Populist movement,

00:01:40.714 --> 00:01:45.151
uniting farmers and workers against
urban elites.

00:01:45.151 --> 00:01:49.472
By 1896, the movement had grown
into the People's Party,

00:01:49.472 --> 00:01:52.353
and its support of Democrat
Williams Jennings Bryan

00:01:52.353 --> 00:01:54.911
put him in reach of the presidency.

00:01:54.911 --> 00:01:57.182
Meanwhile in Oz, claimed Littlefield,

00:01:57.182 --> 00:01:59.782
Dorothy is a typical American girl

00:01:59.782 --> 00:02:03.692
whose hard life in Kansas is literally
turned upside down

00:02:03.692 --> 00:02:07.662
by powerful forces outside her control.

00:02:07.662 --> 00:02:11.754
The munchkins are the common people
oppressed by the Witch of the East,

00:02:11.754 --> 00:02:13.773
banks and monopolies.

00:02:13.773 --> 00:02:15.621
The Scarecrow is the farmer,

00:02:15.621 --> 00:02:19.033
considered naive but actually
quite resourceful,

00:02:19.033 --> 00:02:24.243
the Tin Woodman is the industrial worker
dehumanized by factory labor,

00:02:24.243 --> 00:02:27.313
and the Cowardly Lion 
is William Jennings Bryan

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:31.155
who could be an influential figure
if only he were brave enough

00:02:31.155 --> 00:02:34.564
to adopt the Populist's radical program.

00:02:34.564 --> 00:02:37.534
Together, they travel along
a golden yellow road

00:02:37.534 --> 00:02:43.675
towards a grand city whose ruler's power
turns out to be built on illusions.

00:02:43.675 --> 00:02:47.444
Littlefield published some of these
observations in an essay.

00:02:47.444 --> 00:02:50.944
His claim that this fantasy was actually
a subversive critique

00:02:50.944 --> 00:02:55.715
of American capitalism appealed
to many people in 1960s.

00:02:55.715 --> 00:02:57.795
Other scholars took up the theme,

00:02:57.795 --> 00:03:01.574
and the proposed analogies
and connections multiplied.

00:03:01.574 --> 00:03:03.695
They suggested that Dorothy's dog Toto

00:03:03.695 --> 00:03:07.635
represented the teetotalers
of the prohibition party.

00:03:07.635 --> 00:03:10.586
Oz was clearly the abbreviation
for ounces,

00:03:10.586 --> 00:03:12.775
an important unit in the silver debate.

00:03:12.775 --> 00:03:14.765
The list goes on.

00:03:14.765 --> 00:03:19.095
By the 1980s, this understanding
of the book was accepted so widely

00:03:19.095 --> 00:03:21.416
that several American history textbooks

00:03:21.416 --> 00:03:25.636
mentioned it in discussions of
late 19th century politics.

00:03:25.636 --> 00:03:27.764
But is the theory right?

00:03:27.764 --> 00:03:32.134
L. Frank Baum's introduction claims the 
book is just an innocent children's story.

00:03:32.134 --> 00:03:35.703
Could he have been deliberately
throwing people off the trail?

00:03:35.703 --> 00:03:39.373
And is it fair to second guess
him so many decades later?

00:03:39.373 --> 00:03:40.884
There's no definitive answer,

00:03:40.884 --> 00:03:43.255
which is part of why authorial intent

00:03:43.255 --> 00:03:47.195
is a complex, tangled, fun question
to unravel.

00:03:47.195 --> 00:03:50.537
And some recent scholars have interpreted
"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"

00:03:50.537 --> 00:03:52.915
in the opposite way as Littlefield.

00:03:52.915 --> 00:03:57.664
They claim it's a celebration of the 
new urban consumer culture.

00:03:57.664 --> 00:04:02.144
Historian William Leach argued that
the dazzling Emerald City of Oz

00:04:02.144 --> 00:04:06.785
was meant to acclimate people
to the shiny, new America.

00:04:06.785 --> 00:04:09.786
In the end, all we know
for sure is that Baum,

00:04:09.786 --> 00:04:11.985
inspired by European folk legends,

00:04:11.985 --> 00:04:15.555
had set out to create one
for American children.

00:04:15.555 --> 00:04:18.506
And whether or not he intended
any hidden meanings,

00:04:18.506 --> 00:04:21.746
its continuing relevance suggests
he succeeded

00:04:21.746 --> 00:04:25.676
in creating a fairytale
America can call its own.
