00:00:10.795 --> 00:00:11.420
DAVE ADAMS: OK.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.400
Thanks very much for having me.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.840
How's everybody doing today?

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:15.634
AUDIENCE: Good.

00:00:15.634 --> 00:00:16.550
DAVE ADAMS: All right.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.230
Very exciting
group we got today.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.860
So we're going to talk a little
bit, everything about beer.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.876
I first wanted to say, because
I just saw this guy walk in,

00:00:24.876 --> 00:00:26.750
can I see your shirt,
sir, in the back there?

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.000
Can you stand up?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.260
You have a Brewgler shirt.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.540
That is amazing.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.040
OK.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.060
So I just wanted to get
that out of the way.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.150
So what I'd like
to do is really we

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.490
can make the
presentation as technical

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.770
or is surface level
as you'd like.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.570
What I really like to have
happen during these talks

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.630
is for people ask
questions, and that's

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.400
what makes it fun
and interesting.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.130
I mean, I can sit up here and
talk at you the entire time,

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.890
but it's much more fun if
we make it interactive.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.675
And if you have a
question about beer,

00:00:59.675 --> 00:01:01.550
I'm pretty sure that
someone else in the room

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.008
had that same question or wanted
to know the answer for it.

00:01:04.008 --> 00:01:06.950
So please ask anything
that you'd like to know,

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.460
and it could be literally
anything beer related or life

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.785
tips or facial hair
or whatever you want.

00:01:12.785 --> 00:01:14.160
We can talk about
all that stuff.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.150
All right?

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.170
So the basics are we're
going to talk about,

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.690
a little bit about the
history of the company, where

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.120
we came from.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.780
I'm going to touch,
kind of sprinkle

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.306
in, the history of beer
throughout the presentation,

00:01:25.306 --> 00:01:27.680
as we talk about ingredients,
brewing process, and things

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.400
like that.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.270
Then, we'll move
into ingredients.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.590
We'll then do a short talk
on the brewing process

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.670
and how those
ingredients are used.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.030
And then, we're going
to talk about sort

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.790
of the mechanics of
sensory evaluation

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.350
and sensory vocabulary.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.200
And then we're going to
break from the presentation

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.960
and go drink a bunch of beer
and do a live sensory vocabulary

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.700
training, and it'll
be really fun.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.370
I'll teach you how
to talk about beer.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.680
How many people in
the room have felt

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.559
intimidated at a
bar or restaurant

00:01:59.559 --> 00:02:01.100
before, when they're
ordering a beer?

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.780
And you don't want
to sound dumb,

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.710
or you don't know how
to pronounce the beer,

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.001
or you don't know how to
describe the beer to a friend?

00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:10.250
Or the server who's asking you
about what you want, and you

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.930
go, uh, I don't know.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.681
I want it good.

00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:14.180
Right?

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.617
We've all experienced
that before.

00:02:15.617 --> 00:02:18.200
OK well, I'm going to make it
so you're not like that anymore,

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.580
and you guys are
all wizards when you

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.871
go to the bars and restaurants.

00:02:20.871 --> 00:02:22.531
Sound cool?

00:02:22.531 --> 00:02:23.030
All right.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.530
I also need way more enthusiasm
throughout the presentation.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.030
OK?

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.800
So when I say something
the next time,

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.420
you've got to give
me a little action.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.070
All right?

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.390
OK, history of Green Flash.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.790
So we opened in 2002.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.210
We opened about
the summer of 2002.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.710
We made very kind of
beach-going beers at the time.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.740
We made a beer called
extra pale ale.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.420
We made a ruby red ale.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.170
They were all kind of
4 to 5 1/2% alcohol,

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.040
easy drinking beach-going beers.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.010
We're up in Vista, if
you're not familiar,

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.390
that's about 35 miles north
of here, inland, off the 15,

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.040
and we're in kind
of a business park

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.415
there, where you see a lot of
the small breweries hanging

00:03:03.415 --> 00:03:04.050
out.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.650
About two years
into our operation,

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.640
we hired a new brewmaster named
Chuck Silva, and at the time,

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.480
IPAs were just starting
to come around and be

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.480
popular and present
in the beer community.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.620
And Mike Hinkley, who is our
owner, he came up to chuck

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.430
and said, hey, I really want
to make the quintessential West

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.610
Coast-Style IPA, the San
Diego IPA that we can really

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:29.660
hang our hat on.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.680
And then lo and behold, he made
a beer called West Coast IPA.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.700
And if you guys aren't
familiar with that,

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.200
it's very popular West
Coast-Style IPA and one

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.030
of the first of its
kind that really helped

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.150
champion that style that
was sort of born in San

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.500
Diego and Southern California.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.030
That terminology has been
used throughout the nation,

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.600
throughout the world, really,
about what a West Coast-Style

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.520
IPA is.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.310
And if you wonder what a
West Coast-Style IPA is,

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.120
it means just highly hopped.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.970
Lots of dry hop, which
means lots of hop aroma,

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.600
lots of bitterness, and a very
pale malt structure to it,

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.820
which that will all
make sense later.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.140
OK?

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.770
In 2007, we launched a
beer called Le Freak which

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.029
was the first American
Belgian-Style IPA that

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:21.870
was inspired by
Hoopla and Chouffe

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.692
from Brasserie
d'Achouffe, and that's

00:04:23.692 --> 00:04:25.400
been one of our most
award-winning beers.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.410
We're actually going to taste
that beer today which is

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:28.850
awesome, very excited for you.

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:29.475
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:04:29.475 --> 00:04:30.556
DAVE ADAMS: There we go.

00:04:30.556 --> 00:04:32.730
See, we got
something going here.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.910
I like this, guys.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.917
In 2011, we move from
Vista down to where

00:04:37.917 --> 00:04:40.250
we're at right now, right
down the street from you guys.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.770
We knew that there would
be a Google facility here

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.620
eventually, and we thought
we'd move down there.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.350
So we started brewing.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.250
At Vista, we're brewing
about 13,000 barrels a year,

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.040
and when you think of a
barrel, it's actually two kegs.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.360
So it's 31 gallons.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.960
The biggest keg that you can get
is 15.5 gallon keg, otherwise

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.490
known as a half barrel.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.130
When you hear people talk
about the production of beer

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.590
at a major brewery,
they talk about it

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.000
in barrels, which would just
be double that, so 31 gallons.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.780
So we made about 26,000
kegs or 13,000 barrels

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:14.920
at the old facility.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.800
We distributed to
about 15 states or so.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.940
Now, we are at the pace of
about 100,000 barrels or so.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.547
So significantly more
from where we were at.

00:05:28.547 --> 00:05:30.130
Right when we moved
into the building,

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.330
we immediately started brewing
at about 40,000 barrel a year

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.830
pace.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.970
So going from 13
to 40, obviously,

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.860
that's a huge pain in the ass,
and it was very difficult.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.044
But we did it, and now we
have a cool tasting room

00:05:42.044 --> 00:05:43.210
and a fun place to go visit.

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.220
So come see us.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.580
2014, we bought a
brewery that opened

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.260
the same year that
we did, in 2002,

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.659
called Alpine Beer Company.

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:53.200
They were known for
making, and still

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.980
are known for making, super
awesome delicious IPAs,

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.040
especially Nelson and Duet, and
we're going to have one of them

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.280
today called Windows Up which
is kind of a variant on Duet.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.290
So for the people
that like hoppy beers,

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.210
you're going to be
very excited about that

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.120
if you haven't had it.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.100
In 2015, we opened up
our barrel aging facility

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.750
which is called Cellar 3.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.830
Cellar 3 is in Poway.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:20.440
It's about a 20 minute drive
east of here, up one exit,

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.729
off the Scripps Poway
Parkway, right by the Costco.

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:26.020
Apparently, people like Costco.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.603
I always have to
describe it that way.

00:06:27.603 --> 00:06:30.340
I'm like, yeah, we're
about 4 1/2 miles up,

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.400
east on Scripps Poway.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.240
And they're like,
yeah, I don't know,

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.840
and it's right off
of there, and it's

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.548
like, there's a Costco
across the street.

00:06:36.548 --> 00:06:41.440
Oh, the Costco, of course.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.880
I love that facility,
personally, on a personal note.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.010
We use a rotating
art gallery as well,

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:51.760
and there's probably about 12
to 15 barrel-aged beers on draft

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.490
all the time.

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.090
Which is impossible
to find anywhere,

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.340
and it's very, very cool.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:01.682
In 2016, we opened up our place
in Virginia Beach, Virginia,

00:07:01.682 --> 00:07:02.390
which is awesome.

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.100
We did that for
shipping purposes.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.830
So now, we have a
brewery on each coast

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:08.050
that can ship anywhere
that they need to ship.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:10.630
And we also opened a super
giant tasting room there,

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.750
the beer garden is actually
the size of our entire building

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:14.290
over here.

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:15.310
So it's massive.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.517
It holds like 3,000 people, and
a really fun place to visit.

00:07:18.517 --> 00:07:20.350
So if you're ever out
on the opposite coast,

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:21.310
and you want to go check it out.

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.830
You've got a little home
away from home in Green Flash

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:24.550
out there.

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:29.179
And in 2018, coming
up very soon,

00:07:29.179 --> 00:07:31.220
we're going to open a
place in Lincoln, Nebraska.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.304
So we bought an old
defunct brewpub out there

00:07:34.304 --> 00:07:36.220
and I'm working on the
construction right now.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:39.550
And just hired a chef, and
we'll get our final inspection

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:41.580
later this month, and
hopefully we'll get going.

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.420
So if you're ever in the
middle of the country,

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:45.250
and you want to pop by,
need a home away from home,

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:46.583
we've got you covered there too.

00:07:46.583 --> 00:07:47.770
All right.

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:51.130
Any questions on the
Green Flash stuff?

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:52.090
No?

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:53.090
Yes?

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:55.628
The Brewgle guy.

00:07:55.628 --> 00:07:57.580
AUDIENCE: Why Lincoln, Nebraska?

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:00.550
DAVE ADAMS: Lincoln, Nebraska,
why Lincoln, Nebraska?

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:03.100
I could say, why
anywhere, and answer it

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.160
the same way, which
would be that we

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.780
want to be at a local or
regional brewery to as

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.660
many people as we
can, moving forward.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:18.850
So we feel like there are
so many great breweries

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:21.020
in so many towns, nowadays.

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:24.460
Now that people are learning how
to make awesome beer, that it's

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:28.090
less of a draw to
buy national beer

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:31.540
when you have a bunch of great
breweries around your town.

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:35.500
And Lincoln, it's
a college town,

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.380
University of Nebraska's
there, and it's also growing,

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.730
building, beer community.

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:42.460
So we really like those
emerging beer communities,

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:43.979
where hopefully we
can get in early

00:08:43.979 --> 00:08:46.270
and be a part of the community
and integrate ourselves.

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:50.230
So same thing with any other
kind of those types of areas

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:52.600
that we want to be a part of.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.626
Anything else?

00:08:53.626 --> 00:08:57.280
AUDIENCE: Do you brew the full
line up in both locations?

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.935
DAVE ADAMS: At
Virginia or San Diego?

00:08:58.935 --> 00:08:59.560
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.130
DAVE ADAMS: We do.

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:00.520
Yes.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:01.480
AUDIENCE: Can you
repeat the question?

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.396
DAVE ADAMS: Oh, sorry.

00:09:02.396 --> 00:09:07.934
The question was do we brew the
full lineup at both locations?

00:09:07.934 --> 00:09:09.850
So the way that we decide
on the brew schedule

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:11.660
is just really based on demand.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:13.810
So if we have orders, if
we have a bunch of orders

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:16.480
on the east coast
we'll most likely

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.600
brew them out of Virginia and
ship them out of Virginia,

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.400
and then the same goes
with the west coast.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.400
And we do see a difference
in the mix out there.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.680
If you take the
tasting room alone,

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:29.380
here, we have a bunch IPA
is at the top of our list.

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:32.700
And on the east coast, we have
a bunch of the darker beers

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.250
and pale ales and
things like that.

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:37.310
So it's definitely a different
audience out there that we see.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.880
So the mix of the
production is slightly

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.720
different because of that.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.220
Yes?

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.595
AUDIENCE: How much does the
water chemistry on each coast

00:09:44.595 --> 00:09:45.380
affect the taste?

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:48.150
DAVE ADAMS: It affects
it significantly.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:49.260
That's a great question.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:50.760
The question was-- sorry, Adam.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.760
I keep getting yelled at
to repeat the question.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.000
I'm repeating it.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.770
The question was how much does
the water chemistry affect

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:01.640
the flavor of the beer, and
the answer is significantly.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:06.830
The minerality in the
water changes a lot.

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:09.370
It really changes kind of--

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:11.130
it's not a great term
for it-- but I would

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:13.710
say the softness of the beer.

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:17.540
The way that the hops, from a
bitterness standpoint and acid

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:21.050
standpoint, interact with the
minerals in the water really

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:25.500
effects of the overall
bitterness and sort of mouth

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:26.760
feel profile there.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.390
So the water is very
soft over there,

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:31.250
and it is very hard over here.

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:33.620
And it's also a little bit
more difficult over here too

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.510
because we have
several different water

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:36.740
sources over here.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.410
So it's hard to say what
the minerality looks

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:40.970
like in our water profile.

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:42.360
It's very inconsistent.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.570
So we try our best
to level it out

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:46.550
with stripping out
some of those minerals

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:48.500
and making it consistent.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.140
But the reality is,
if we had our choice,

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.877
I'm sure we would select to
make the water profile just

00:10:53.877 --> 00:10:56.210
like the one in Virginia,
because we really like brewing

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:57.360
with that stuff.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.720
But that would be triple
reverse osmosis over here,

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.210
would be a huge capital
investment to do,

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:05.830
but it's something
that we do want to do.

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:09.610
Any other questions?

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:10.110
Yes?

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:12.587
AUDIENCE: So softer
water softens the hops?

00:11:12.587 --> 00:11:13.420
DAVE ADAMS: Correct.

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:17.310
Yeah, it's not as harsh of
a bitterness, if you will,

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:19.760
with the softer water.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.010
AUDIENCE: Repeat the question.

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:21.926
DAVE ADAMS: OK, sorry.

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:28.970
I will learn to
repeat the question.

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:29.771
My apologies.

00:11:29.771 --> 00:11:30.270
OK.

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:32.990
Moving right along, let's
talk about ingredients here.

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:35.860
So I brought some
agreements along with me.

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:39.590
Beer is made out of four main
ingredients-- barley, hops,

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:41.339
water, and yeast.

00:11:41.339 --> 00:11:42.380
So I brought some barley.

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:43.460
We'll talk about that first.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:45.626
I'm going to go ahead and
pass that around the room.

00:11:45.626 --> 00:11:49.530
Here it is for everybody
to see on the camera.

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:52.530
The barley that you have in
front of you, when you see it,

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:57.870
is a two-row pale malt, and
that has lots of terminology

00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:00.610
in there that I will
break down for you.

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:04.210
But basically, barley is
grown in two different types.

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:06.390
There's two-row and six-row.

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:08.730
And two-row, the
basic difference--

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:12.930
besides the physical structure
of the barley stock itself--

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:15.840
is that two-row
kernels, barley kernels,

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.240
are a little more plumper
and have a little more starch

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.570
content to them.

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:21.270
And ipso facto, a
little more sugar

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:23.650
content to them than
six-row kernels.

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:28.560
Craft breweries widely used
two-row barley, rather than

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:29.280
six-row barley.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:32.760
Six-row is used by the
macrobreweries mostly.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.190
So you'll see Anheuser-Busch
and MillerCoors and stuff

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:37.740
like that mostly using
six-row, as well as

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:41.430
they use some adjuncts
as sugar additions

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:43.900
that most craft
breweries do not.

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:47.550
So the basic mechanics
of malted barley

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:50.910
is that, well, first of all,
to get to the malting process

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:51.720
is very important.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.910
So you grow the
barley, and then you

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:56.130
have to send it off to
the malting facility,

00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:58.560
and this was--

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.960
I went to the Simpsons
malting facility right outside

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:04.690
of London, about three
hours outside of London,

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:06.501
and they've been
around for decades

00:13:06.501 --> 00:13:07.500
and decades and decades.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.680
The guys who showed
us around the facility

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:14.140
had both been there for 30
years, which is amazing.

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:16.810
So they've been
malting barley forever.

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:18.810
So basically, you're
going to grow the barley,

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:21.870
and then you hydrate
it in a giant vessel.

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:24.060
Fill it full of
water, hydrate it up,

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:26.910
then you put it into a
vessel called the GKV which

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:28.759
the Germinating Kilning Vessel.

00:13:28.759 --> 00:13:30.300
So think about when
you're in school,

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.670
and you put a little
seed in your paper towel,

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:34.920
and watered down,
and let it sprout.

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.560
And as it started to sprout,
it was turning into a plant.

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:38.070
Right?

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:40.260
Well, that's the end of
the germination process,

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.240
as far as malted
barley is concerned.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:45.800
So they stop the germination
process by heating it up,

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:49.020
and that's the kilning
portion of malting the barley,

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:51.790
and from there, you
have malted barley.

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:55.560
So that is-- what you see
right there is the lightest

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:59.430
malting of a malted barley that
you will get, most of the time.

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:02.220
It's called two-row pale
malt. Pale as in the reference

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.380
to the color, and two-rows,
because it's two-row.

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.030
Right?

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:08.910
After that, the way
that you heat the barley

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:12.754
is going to change not
only the sugar content,

00:14:12.754 --> 00:14:14.670
but it's also going to
change the color of it.

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:17.010
So we've all seen different
colored beers out there,

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:21.720
from deep black to very
pale and strong color.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.900
And those colors come
from the different malt

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:26.550
that they put
inside of the beer.

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:29.220
Now, how much they put
inside of the beer--

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:32.020
how much of that malt
or what color it is--

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:33.750
is totally up to the brewers.

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:38.880
And I will kind of dispel some
myths around the colors of beer

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:42.300
later on, but basically,
this malted barley

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:44.290
is our sugar content.

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:47.310
So by having this
special malting process,

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:50.070
we end up with this enzyme
inside of the malted barley

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:52.440
kernel that can convert
its own starches

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.760
into fermentable sugars.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:54.819
It's extremely important.

00:14:54.819 --> 00:14:57.360
So all you have to do is add a
little bit of hot water to it,

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.620
and then you have sugar water.

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:02.030
You have fermentable sugar water
afterwards, which is amazing.

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:04.770
It also has a lot of
historical implications,

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:07.740
because when we switch
from a society of hunters

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:11.100
and gatherers to more of
an agricultural society,

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.560
we use barley for lots
of different things,

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.350
like porridge and making
bread and things like that.

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:19.260
And as they were out
harvesting this barley,

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.470
one time it rained, and it
began the germination process.

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:24.975
So the barley had
basically malted itself,

00:15:24.975 --> 00:15:27.150
or it started the
germination itself.

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:32.820
And then when they dumped it
into the bowl to make porridge,

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:34.980
they ended up with
malted barley that

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:38.940
sparked this enzymatic
reaction, and there's wild yeast

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:40.650
around us all the time.

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:43.350
So this wild yeast and
bacteria in the air

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:47.070
went in and fermented this
fermentable beverage that

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:49.830
was sitting in the pot
and started foaming over,

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:51.030
and they had beer.

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:52.830
It made beer, and
then someone crazy

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:56.070
decided to put like some reed
straw in there and drink it

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:58.590
and felt funny afterwards,
and then beer was born.

00:15:58.590 --> 00:15:59.430
That was it.

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:02.250
So that was about 10,000
years ago, in ancient Africa,

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:05.790
and that's the most detailed
version of the history of beer

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:07.320
that you could
possibly get into.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:11.040
So after this, the different
amounts that we heated,

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:15.260
again, affect the color
and the flavor of the beer.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.544
They basically affect the
fermentable sugar content

00:16:18.544 --> 00:16:19.960
that you're going
to have in there

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:22.251
and then what kind of flavors
that you're going to get.

00:16:22.251 --> 00:16:24.090
So think about if you--

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:26.640
how many people cook at home?

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:27.330
OK.

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:28.920
Not like microwaving
grilled cheese,

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:29.960
like you actually could.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.820
OK, so if you cut up an onion,
you throw it into a pan,

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:35.610
you're starting a
caramelization process, usually.

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:36.120
Right?

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.880
So the natural sugars
inside of that onion

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.680
are going to come
out to the outside.

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:42.630
We've all had caramelized
onions before.

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:46.025
And what happens is, when you do
it for a little bit in the pan,

00:16:46.025 --> 00:16:47.650
you get a little
browning on the edges.

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:50.110
You get a little caramelly
characteristic to the onion.

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:51.580
If you do it for
a long time, you

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:55.240
end up with a deep, tan, rich
onion with lots of sugar,

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.740
lots of caramelly
qualities to it.

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:57.280
Right?

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.240
It's the same kind of
thing with malted barley.

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.740
So you can caramelize
malted barley very lightly,

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:03.690
and you can have--

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:06.849
it's called crystal malt,
and it has a wide range

00:17:06.849 --> 00:17:09.609
of numbers, which is
a lovibond scale that

00:17:09.609 --> 00:17:10.900
says how dark they are.

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.599
So a C15 malt would be
something that you'd

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:16.210
see in a normal IPA
or pale ale, means

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:20.650
that it's 15 degrees lovibond,
means it's very light in color.

00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:23.710
And then all the way
to CE 143, that's

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:27.012
going to be that deep,
rich, caramelized onion

00:17:27.012 --> 00:17:27.970
kind of characteristic.

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:29.553
And that's something
that you'd see in

00:17:29.553 --> 00:17:34.720
like in imperial red ale or a
deep amber, copper colored ale,

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.730
and it's going to have
more sugar content.

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:38.710
Also, the longer
that you heat it,

00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:40.780
the less starch
content that you get.

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:43.120
So then you end up with
a lower alcohol beer.

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:45.910
So a lot of times, people
think that darker beers are

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:47.161
stronger than lighter beers.

00:17:47.161 --> 00:17:47.660
Right?

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:50.350
You've probably all seen that
before, heard that before.

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:52.030
Maybe you still
think that right now.

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:53.230
It's totally untrue.

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:53.930
OK?

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:57.730
And the reason why is because
the amount of malt that you use

00:17:57.730 --> 00:17:59.740
is directly responsible--

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:01.000
with the sugar content--

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.940
which is directly responsible
for the alcohol content

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:04.690
that you have.

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:08.170
So for example, if I were
to make an imperial stout,

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:10.330
and I were to use
this glass right here.

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:13.240
I would probably fill
it up to about here

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:15.790
with two-row pale malt
that you see walking around

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:20.140
the room there, and then, about
that much of roasted malt,

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:20.770
and that's it.

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:22.510
Because roast malt
does not provide

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:26.620
a lot of alcohol content, but
it provides a nice, dark color

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:28.600
to it and a little bit
of a roasty quality,

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:31.120
because it's roasted like
a coffee bean would be.

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:33.940
And that is what makes
the alcohol so high

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:36.100
is using a bunch
of that light malt.

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:39.100
So if I were to take one glass
full of light malt and one

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:42.220
glass full of roasted malt
that was burnt to hell,

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:45.220
that light malt would
be a very strong beer,

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:48.340
and the dark malt would be
extremely bitter and not very

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:49.300
strong.

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:51.940
For example Guinness,
that's very dark beer.

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:56.560
That's 4% alcohol,
very light in alcohol.

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:58.720
So don't judge a book--

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.290
don't judge beer by its color.

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:01.390
How about that?

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:04.420
Book by its cover, beer by
its color, very important.

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:07.870
Any other questions on
malt before we move on?

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:10.210
Great.

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:11.650
OK, here's hops.

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:15.040
Hops are the popular,
exciting ingredient.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:15.700
Right?

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:18.530
So I brought some hops
for you guys to check out,

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:21.280
but before I send those
around, what I wanted to talk

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:23.120
about is where they come from.

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:26.560
So they're grown mostly
in the Pacific Northwest.

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:30.130
Yakima valley Washington does an
enormous percentage of all the

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:31.990
hops that we get in America.

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:35.770
They're also grown in Europe,
Germany, Czech Republic,

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:39.310
the UK, and then they grow some
in the southern hemisphere that

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:42.070
are more similar to what we
grow in the Pacific Northwest,

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:44.920
like Australia and New Zealand.

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:48.400
Hops have a couple of different
really interesting components

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.610
to them.

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:52.480
One is that they have
anti-microbial and

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.730
anti-bacterial
qualities to them.

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:58.600
And the other is that they
have these acids and oils

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.570
that get extracted during
different parts of the brewing

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:05.545
process that can provide
different flavors and aromas

00:20:05.545 --> 00:20:08.620
and mouth feels and all
kinds of different qualities.

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:11.460
And most of the time when people
think of hobs they think of--

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:13.080
what word do you think of?

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.893
You think of like a hoppy beer,
what do you guys think of?

00:20:15.893 --> 00:20:17.027
AUDIENCE: Bitter.

00:20:17.027 --> 00:20:18.110
DAVE ADAMS: Bitter, right.

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:20.870
You think of bitter, but it's
actually not true at all.

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:24.020
Hops are used for a
wide array of flavoring

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:27.120
and sometimes used just
for preservative qualities,

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:30.011
and it has nothing to do
with bitterness whatsoever.

00:20:30.011 --> 00:20:31.010
and we'll get into that.

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:33.720
So hops are grown on
things called bines.

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.510
They're like vines
except for hops,

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:38.130
and they grow about 15
or 20 feet in the air.

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:40.490
And these bines, which
you can see right here,

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:42.200
this is after they've
been chopped down.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:45.590
They get harvested about
once a year, one time a year.

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:47.870
Usually there's an early
harvest and a late harvest

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:49.370
and it's later in
the year, usually

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:51.764
around the October,
September-October range.

00:20:51.764 --> 00:20:53.930
And what they do is they
come in with a thing called

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:57.271
a bottom cutter, and they chop
the bottoms of all the bines

00:20:57.271 --> 00:20:57.770
off.

00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:00.410
And then they come in with
a thing called a top cutter,

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:02.769
crazy, and they chop all
the tops of the bines off.

00:21:02.769 --> 00:21:04.310
They put them in
the back of a truck,

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:06.740
and then they send them
off to a sorting facility.

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:08.150
And the sorting
facility is going

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:12.050
to try to get all of the
cones off of the hop.

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:15.170
So if you guys have ever
seen a hop cone before--

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:17.420
let me fast forward here--

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.317
this is what hop
cones look like.

00:21:19.317 --> 00:21:21.150
That happens to be me
smelling them as well,

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:24.150
but you can see that there's
a whole array of hop cones.

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:27.800
This is after this bine
has been mulched up.

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:30.260
This is at the
same hop farm which

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:34.430
is called Segal Ranch in
Yakima Valley, Washington.

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:37.721
And these hop bines
will get stripped away,

00:21:37.721 --> 00:21:39.470
and they all kind of
do it different ways,

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:41.369
but the idea is we
just want the cones.

00:21:41.369 --> 00:21:43.910
They're going to take everything
else and turn it into mulch.

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:45.862
So once they get these
cones out of there,

00:21:45.862 --> 00:21:48.320
they're going to send them off
to a kilning facility, where

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:51.470
they're going to dry out the
water, any remaining water

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:52.910
that's left in these cones.

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:55.940
And then they're going to send
them off to a baling area.

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:58.640
They're going to bale them
up into giant 100 pound bales

00:21:58.640 --> 00:21:59.810
or so.

00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:01.850
After that, most
of the hops that

00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:05.970
are used at commercial
breweries are in pellet form.

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:08.660
So they send off these
dehydrated flowers

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:12.140
to these pelletizing facilities.
that grind it up into a powder,

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:15.194
shoot it out of dye, and then
ends up like this rabbit food

00:22:15.194 --> 00:22:16.860
that I've got in this
glass, right here.

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:18.320
So I'm going pass this around.

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:21.020
What I'd like you to do--
you'll make a tiny bit of mess,

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:23.280
but I'm sure you guys
have some vacuums--

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:27.470
if you pull out one of the
little rabbit pellets in there,

00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:31.580
and you smash it up real
good, and then you smell it.

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:33.950
That is called
volatizing the oils,

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:36.260
and like I mentioned
earlier, there's

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:38.360
two really important
parts of the hops which

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:44.000
come from one part of the sort
of anatomy of the hop which

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.860
is called the lupulin gland.

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:50.270
So if you ever heard hoppy
beers that reference lupulin

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:54.080
or lupulis or things like that,
that's all because of the hop.

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:57.080
Inside of the hop has a gland,
called the lupulin gland,

00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:59.690
and it's this waxy,
yellow substance

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:02.690
that houses two important
parts called the resins

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:04.310
and the essential oils.

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:07.070
So in its most basic
term, the resins

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:09.170
are what create
bitterness and beer,

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:11.840
and they're judged on a
scale called alpha acids.

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:14.020
So it's about a
scale from 0 to 20.

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:16.250
So if you had a
20% alpha acid hop

00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:19.807
and use all 20% alpha acid
hops in the boiling part,

00:23:19.807 --> 00:23:21.890
you'd end up with a really
bitter beer afterwards.

00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:24.950
If you didn't use any of
that in the boiling part,

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:27.140
you would end up with no
bitterness in your beer,

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:28.170
basically.

00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:31.580
So it's very tricky to
when people talk about--

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:32.900
when people use the word--

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:35.450
Before I continue, my
least favorite word

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:37.087
in the beer industry is hoppy.

00:23:37.087 --> 00:23:38.420
I just thought I'd let you know.

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:42.180
So if you say hoppy,
we might fight later.

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:44.750
So don't say hoppy,
and you'll learn

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:47.330
more of why I don't want
you to say hoppy right

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:50.540
now and also a lot more when
we do the sensory evaluation.

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:55.920
Because it's like saying a
beer is wet or alcoholic,

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.160
because it all has hops in it.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:01.280
It all is hoppy to
some degree or another.

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:04.970
It just depends on how many hops
they use, when they use them,

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:06.740
what types of hops
they use, what

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:08.980
were the statistics of
those hops they used.

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:12.170
This is a very broad,
really crappy term

00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:14.760
that doesn't describe anything
that has to do with beer.

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:15.260
OK?

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:17.240
So stop saying hoppy
for the rest your lives.

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:20.660
All right, moving on from that.

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:22.600
The other part is
the essential oils.

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.920
The essential oils are what
you're smelling right now.

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:29.750
So when you crush up that hop
pellet there and smell it,

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:31.970
that's because we smash
the oils inside of there,

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:33.480
and they all released
into the air.

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:34.980
That's called
volatizing the oils.

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:36.830
So if you ever go to
a cool cocktail bar,

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:38.538
and you get an old
fashioned or something

00:24:38.538 --> 00:24:41.990
with a little rind of orange
or lemon or whatever on it.

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:44.630
And you see him squeeze
the rind on there

00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:46.460
and twist it around
the rim glass,

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:47.660
you guys seen that before?

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:48.510
That's what they're doing.

00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:49.900
They're doing the same thing
that we're doing right now.

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:51.020
It's volatizing the oils.

00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:52.940
There's a bunch of the
essential oils inside

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:54.230
of the rind of the orange.

00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:55.280
They squeeze it.

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.940
It shoots out, and then they put
it around the rim of the glass

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:01.580
so as you take a
drink, the orange aroma

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:03.470
is on the rim of the glass.

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:06.942
So that's what we're
extracting during the very end

00:25:06.942 --> 00:25:07.900
of the brewing process.

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:11.240
So when you smell an IPA
or a hop forward beer,

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.870
in some way, shape, or form,
IPA, double IPA, hoppy pale

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:16.420
ale, whatever it may be, You
put your nose into the glass,

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:20.770
and you smell those pine and
citrus and grassy and resinous

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:22.330
notes, all those fun things.

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:25.600
That all comes from that
piece of the lupulin glands,

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.836
the essential oil of the hop.

00:25:27.836 --> 00:25:29.290
Make sense?

00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:30.160
OK, great.

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:34.330
There's about 150 or
so different commercial

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:36.920
hops out there in the world.

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:40.030
Then, there's a whole
bunch of experimental hops.

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:44.080
The Perrault Farms are the
guys who make mosaic hops,

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:48.160
for the people who are super
beer nerds in the stands there.

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:51.007
And they also run
the hop breeders--

00:25:51.007 --> 00:25:53.590
I forget what it's called-- hop
breeders society, hop breeders

00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:55.210
union, something
like that, and he

00:25:55.210 --> 00:26:00.220
has maybe 10,000 different
varietals of hops growing

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:01.520
at their facility.

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:05.110
And they want to try to find the
next new Citra or Mosaic, which

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:07.149
are all cool, hip, and
happening hops, if you

00:26:07.149 --> 00:26:08.190
don't know what they are.

00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:12.670
And the time that
it takes from a hop

00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:16.210
to go from what's planted in the
ground, this experimental hop,

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:18.220
to now it's as
commercially-viable hop

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:19.840
that everybody in
the country can buy

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.790
can be around 8 to 10 years.

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:24.620
So it takes an
extremely long time,

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:27.940
especially if you look at beer--
the craft beer as a whole is

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:29.190
kind of in its infancy.

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:29.770
Right?

00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:33.370
We're only 25 years
old, maybe or so,

00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:35.500
that it really
started ramping up

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.810
and really only in the
last probably decade it's

00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:39.370
got very popular.

00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:42.310
And now you see
commercials of people

00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:44.560
that want credit cards
to open their breweries

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:45.750
and stuff like that.

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:47.361
That shit didn't
happen 20 years ago.

00:26:47.361 --> 00:26:47.860
Right?

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:51.305
Nobody cared about
beer, so pretty crazy.

00:26:51.305 --> 00:26:53.180
Any questions on hops
that we have out there?

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:53.951
Yes?

00:26:53.951 --> 00:26:55.950
AUDIENCE: What about this
area for growing hops?

00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:58.720
What is you're
perspective in that?

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:01.206
DAVE ADAMS: We do not have
a great area for growing--

00:27:01.206 --> 00:27:02.080
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:04.080
DAVE ADAMS: Thank you.

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.550
OK, now I'm back.

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:08.500
Hey, Adam, I'm going to
repeat the question right now.

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:11.050
What do I think about this
area for growing hops?

00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:12.700
What are my thoughts on that?

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:14.090
Great question.

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:18.520
I think that this is not an
awesome area to grow hops.

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:21.550
We do not really have
the climate to grow hops.

00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:25.210
If you actually follow
the parallels along both

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:26.890
in the northern
southern hemisphere,

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:29.170
you'll find that the
places where they grow

00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:31.990
hops all follow
the same parallels.

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:34.810
So for some reason
or another, be it

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:37.720
the soil or the amount
of light that we

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:39.700
have throughout the
day, it's just not

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.080
an awesome area to grow hops.

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:43.360
Doesn't mean it can't
be done, but probably

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:44.860
just not on a massive scale.

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:45.940
It's already being done.

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:48.360
There are people that grow
local hops out in Valley Center

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:50.290
and Jamul and things
like that, but just

00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:52.720
to give you an
idea, just for us,

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:55.120
which we're not that
big of a brewery.

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:57.280
The San Diego
location we probably

00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:00.630
brew 70,000 barrels or
something like that.

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:04.240
If we wanted one
hop for one beer,

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:08.230
we would need 40,000 pounds
or so of hops to make it

00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:10.000
a National Beer.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.050
And that's probably
like 400 times

00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:16.460
the amount that they
make in San Diego County,

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:18.280
and that's just one
hop for one beer.

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:23.954
So I think that, as a fun
hobby, you could totally do it,

00:28:23.954 --> 00:28:26.120
and you could probably make
some pretty decent hops.

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:27.520
But on a massive
scale, if you're

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:30.070
to open up a giant farm with
acres and acres of land,

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:32.915
it's probably not
the best operation.

00:28:32.915 --> 00:28:33.415
Yes.

00:28:33.415 --> 00:28:35.500
AUDIENCE: What else
are hops used for?

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:38.011
DAVE ADAMS: What else are
hops use for was the question.

00:28:38.011 --> 00:28:40.416
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:44.540
Boom.

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:45.320
Great question.

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.486
What else are hops used for?

00:28:46.486 --> 00:28:51.380
So previously, they were
actually used as a sleep aid.

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:54.440
So they would have
hop-filled pillows.

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:57.140
And in the history of
beer, they actually

00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:01.110
weren't used in beer
for a long time,

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:05.360
up until about the year 1500 was
when they started getting used.

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:07.310
That's when they
were widely adopted.

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:09.170
Previously, they
used a mixture called

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:13.400
gruit which like a spice
mixture, similar to what you'd

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:19.520
get out of like a Jagermeister
or a fernet or something

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:22.940
like that, like spruce tips
and very herbaceous qualities

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:23.510
to it.

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:27.650
So I don't think that there is
any other real super popular

00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:30.620
uses for hops other than
growing them for decorations

00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:33.260
or using them in beer in
some way, shape, or form.

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:36.110
People use lots of
different ways in beer.

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:37.280
There's some fringy stuff.

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:40.220
Like people make air fresheners
out of them or Chapstick

00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:43.070
out of them and things like
that, but for the most part,

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:44.540
that's what they're used for.

00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:46.370
And part of the
reason why they're

00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:48.020
difficult to use for
many other things

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:51.200
is because they can
be extremely bitter.

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:53.210
And especially
when they're used--

00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:55.430
like if you were to
eat one of those hops,

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:58.580
it would mess up your
palate for a couple of days

00:29:58.580 --> 00:29:59.414
or maybe just a day.

00:29:59.414 --> 00:30:01.788
I probably should have told
you that before I passed them

00:30:01.788 --> 00:30:04.400
around, but I mean, you're not
going to get hurt or anything,

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:07.370
but it just kind of
coats your palate.

00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:09.680
You won't be able
to taste things.

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:13.430
So I see people use them
for flavorings and liquor

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:17.210
occasionally, hop-flavored
vodkas and gins and things

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:19.370
like that, but that's
really about it.

00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:23.530
I don't know any other
commercial uses for them.

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:27.654
OK, the guy with
the Brewgley shirt.

00:30:27.654 --> 00:30:31.344
AUDIENCE: I heard that this was
a really rough year for the hop

00:30:31.344 --> 00:30:34.050
harvest, that there are a
lot fewer hops available.

00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:38.500
Is that going to trickle down to
the consumer in terms of price?

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.627
DAVE ADAMS: The
question was this year

00:30:40.627 --> 00:30:42.460
might have been a
difficult year for the hop

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:44.620
harvest, the amount of
hops that were harvested,

00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:48.310
and is that going to affect the
price of the beer for the end

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:49.810
consumer?

00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:53.200
Throughout the years,
we have not really

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:57.400
seen downward price pressure
from the consumer side because

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:58.450
of the ingredients.

00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:01.900
Which kind of sucks
for us, because it's

00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:06.580
very dissimilar from the
wine industry in the sense

00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:09.490
that when you have a
bad year of grapes.

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:11.420
You can just say our
wines suck that year,

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:12.920
because we had a
bad year of grapes.

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:15.070
But in beer, nobody really
thinks of it that way.

00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:16.690
All of you guys
that drink our beer,

00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:18.652
or any beer for that
matter, you expect

00:31:18.652 --> 00:31:20.860
it to taste exactly the same
every time you drink it.

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:21.460
Right?

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:24.890
You don't go buy your favorite
IPA or pale ale or sour beer

00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:26.575
or whatever it is
and go, wonder what

00:31:26.575 --> 00:31:27.700
it's going to be this time.

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:28.491
Who knows?

00:31:28.491 --> 00:31:28.990
Right?

00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:32.340
That doesn't happen, and that
is the way that it is with wine.

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:32.840
Right?

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:35.590
You see that thing on
the label like 2002

00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:39.177
is better than 2006 is
better than 2009 or whatever.

00:31:39.177 --> 00:31:41.510
We don't really have that
opportunity, most of the time.

00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:43.300
So pretty much everyone
expects the beer

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:45.340
to be the exact
same price and have

00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:48.220
the exact same flavor and
aroma and qualities to it,

00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:48.890
no matter what.

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:51.850
So we're not really
afforded that capability

00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:54.370
of changing the price point
because of the ingredients.

00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:56.440
You either don't make
that beer anymore

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:59.920
or use substitute hops
that maybe had a better

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:02.040
harvest or things like that.

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.232
Go ahead.

00:32:03.232 --> 00:32:05.176
AUDIENCE: So if my
friends say a beer is

00:32:05.176 --> 00:32:08.092
hoppy, if I want to sound cool
do I correct them and say,

00:32:08.092 --> 00:32:09.067
[INAUDIBLE].

00:32:09.067 --> 00:32:10.150
DAVE ADAMS: No, you don't.

00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:13.640
The question was if my
friends say a beer is hoppy,

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:15.970
and I want to be cool and
correct them, do I say

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:17.720
something else.

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:22.270
I think that I am a huge
proponent of education

00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:24.280
and educating people
and especially when

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:28.492
it comes to things that
there's lots of bad information

00:32:28.492 --> 00:32:29.200
that's out there.

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:30.616
Which I think the
beer industry is

00:32:30.616 --> 00:32:32.650
one of those things,
where it's starting

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:35.184
to become more prevalent
that people know more things.

00:32:35.184 --> 00:32:37.100
There's more good
information floating around.

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:40.150
But for a very long time, we had
lots of bad information, lots

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:46.434
of people making up things and
acting like sort of authorities

00:32:46.434 --> 00:32:48.100
on subjects they
probably shouldn't have

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:51.220
been which helped the
spread of poor information,

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:52.010
unfortunately.

00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:53.590
And then we ended up
with things like people

00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:54.610
calling everything hoppy.

00:32:54.610 --> 00:32:55.120
Right?

00:32:55.120 --> 00:33:00.730
So if your friend says, I
think this beer is hoppy,

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:04.240
and if they really care,
and they want to learn more,

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.890
then you can tell
them what you learn

00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:09.480
at the end of this, when we
talk about sensory evaluation.

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:13.595
If they don't care, then
just don't correct them.

00:33:13.595 --> 00:33:15.370
It'll save you a friend.

00:33:15.370 --> 00:33:17.210
Go ahead.

00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:19.210
AUDIENCE: What are the
physical effects of hops,

00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:22.515
like compared to alcohol.

00:33:22.515 --> 00:33:23.890
DAVE ADAMS: The
question was what

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:26.920
are the physical effects of
hops compared to alcohol.

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:28.708
I don't know if I
understand the question.

00:33:28.708 --> 00:33:31.374
AUDIENCE: Well, you get drunk if
you drink alcohol, but is there

00:33:31.374 --> 00:33:33.190
any kind of relaxation or--

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:35.050
DAVE ADAMS: So yes.

00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:37.960
The question was is there
some sort of physical effect

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:40.450
that you can feel from hops?

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:46.150
It was, I suppose,
pontificated that it

00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:49.900
could be a relaxant
of some nature,

00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:52.970
that it could make you sleepy
in some way, shape, or form.

00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:55.660
And some people
do claim that when

00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:58.990
they drink heavily hopped
beers, they become more relaxed.

00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:00.280
They become more sleepy.

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:03.400
Like I mentioned, they used
them in pillows previously.

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:04.904
People who work
the hop farms, they

00:34:04.904 --> 00:34:06.320
would say that
they'd fall asleep.

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:08.070
So I suppose that
there's something there,

00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:11.469
but I personally don't
notice any effects.

00:34:11.469 --> 00:34:13.860
So I don't know.

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:15.210
That's all I got.

00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:16.469
What else?

00:34:16.469 --> 00:34:17.320
Yes?

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:19.280
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
like mosaic hops that

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:21.730
came from the Yakima Valley.

00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:24.670
Are certain hop varietals
particular to a grower,

00:34:24.670 --> 00:34:27.772
like mosaic can only be
purchased from that grower?

00:34:27.772 --> 00:34:28.480
DAVE ADAMS: Yeah.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:31.170
The question was are there
particular hop varietals

00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:34.860
that are out of--

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:38.290
you can only get from one
grower, and the answer is yes.

00:34:38.290 --> 00:34:41.100
And it's actually a
very important part

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:45.060
of understanding hop purchasing,
because when hops are made,

00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:48.580
most of the time, the farm
wants to own that hop.

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:53.100
So nowadays, everybody
has these like name brand

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:55.364
hops that they want to make
only at their hop farm.

00:34:55.364 --> 00:34:57.030
You can only get them
at their hop farm.

00:34:57.030 --> 00:35:00.780
They do license out the
names, and eventually

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:03.120
usually, they end up
growing them other places.

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:06.060
And saying you know this is
mosaic, but it's trademarked,

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:08.520
and it came from Perrault
Farms originally.

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:12.060
And then there was some
shake up awhile back

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:14.100
where-- like the hop that
you guys got to smell

00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:15.870
is called Columbus.

00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:19.560
At that time, there were several
farms growing that same hop,

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:26.370
and it was Columbus, it was also
Zeus, and it was also Tomahawk.

00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:29.220
And so you could buy
Columbus, you could buy Zeus,

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:33.270
you could buy a Tomahawk,
and you could buy CTZ.

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:35.400
It's all the same
hop, but so that

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:37.040
got really messy and
really confusing.

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.520
So we don't see
that much anymore,

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:41.040
but yeah, there's definitely
trademark issues out there

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.920
with hops.

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:43.420
Yes?

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:45.885
AUDIENCE: Does anyone
try to make vintage beer?

00:35:45.885 --> 00:35:47.364
Like you mentioned [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:47.364 --> 00:35:48.412
Does anyone do that?

00:35:48.412 --> 00:35:49.120
DAVE ADAMS: Yeah.

00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:51.160
Lots of people do
it, and it only

00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:54.370
is usually done with barrel-aged
beers most of the time or beers

00:35:54.370 --> 00:35:57.940
that have extreme aging
properties that are not hop

00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:01.360
forward, like imperial
stout or a barley wine

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:04.730
or some sort of sour beer,
something along those lines.

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:05.350
Yeah.

00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:07.200
We can talk about that more.

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:10.170
OK, anything else on hops?

00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:10.670
Great.

00:36:13.467 --> 00:36:14.800
Oh, there's the inside of a hop.

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:15.390
That's cool.

00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:16.944
So this waxy stuff--

00:36:16.944 --> 00:36:18.860
It's a little hard to
see with the projector--

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:22.000
but there's little yellow
dots all over this.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.640
You can kind of see
it in this region.

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:25.890
That's the lupulin gland
that I was talking about.

00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:28.230
So if you were to take a
hop cone and smash it up,

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:29.340
it's real sticky.

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:33.210
And it would have all those
little yellow balls around it,

00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:35.700
and that has all the resins
and the essential oils.

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:37.090
OK, let's talk about water.

00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:41.040
We talked about it a little bit,
about the minerality of water.

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:43.260
The important things that
I want to note on water

00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:45.960
is that the mineral content.

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:48.600
Number one, it affects the
quality of the beer quite a bit

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:50.790
and the qualitative
part of the beer,

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:54.420
and also the quantitative
part of the beer

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:57.300
in some way, shape, or
form in regards to the hops

00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:58.830
and how they interact.

00:36:58.830 --> 00:37:01.050
But also that we have
to reduce the hell out

00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:03.270
of the beer to get it
to where it needs to be.

00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:06.960
So usually we use about five
times the amount of water

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:09.300
that it is equal to liquid.

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:11.640
So if I had this bottle of
water, and I was making beer,

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:13.500
I would need five times
the amount of liquid

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:15.480
in here to make one
glass of beer that

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:16.920
was equal to this bottle.

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:20.324
So it takes a lot of water
to make beer, in other words,

00:37:20.324 --> 00:37:22.740
and then if you were to do
something like reverse osmosis,

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:27.040
it takes exponentially more
water in order to do that.

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:28.740
The other thing to
note about water

00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:34.740
is that the regions that
have different minerals

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:36.000
in their water.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.320
Before, we could strip
the minerals out of water

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:41.820
and adjust the minerals, and
we had chemistry and science

00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:43.230
and all these things.

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:47.040
The type of water really sort
of chose the type of beer

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:48.220
that you made.

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:51.812
So if you were in Pilsen, for
example, you made pilsner,

00:37:51.812 --> 00:37:53.520
because the water was
super soft and it's

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:55.220
great for making pilsners.

00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:58.440
If you were on Burton
upon Trent in England,

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:03.990
you would make an ESB, because
the gypsum in the water

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:06.090
interacts with the
hops and makes a really

00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:07.770
cool characteristic of them.

00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:11.160
So you still see, especially
in the old world countries,

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:12.635
those people that have made--

00:38:12.635 --> 00:38:14.010
and especially
people that didn't

00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:16.020
have to go through
prohibition was a big thing.

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:18.870
Because we had like a little
break in beer making process

00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:22.590
for 11 years, and a lot
of other people didn't--

00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:27.360
so those people, the water
profiles really shaped

00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:29.170
what styles of beers they made.

00:38:29.170 --> 00:38:31.770
As well as the temperature,
because that really

00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:33.726
changed whether you
use lager or ale yeast,

00:38:33.726 --> 00:38:35.350
because there's a
big difference there.

00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:37.214
But those are the main
qualities of water,

00:38:37.214 --> 00:38:39.630
and other that that, water is
really boring to talk about.

00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:41.088
So I'm going to
move on, unless you

00:38:41.088 --> 00:38:43.721
want to know more about water
in some way, shape, or form.

00:38:43.721 --> 00:38:44.220
OK.

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:46.810
This is what it looks like,
if you haven't seen it before.

00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:47.880
All right.

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:48.380
OK.

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:49.890
So there's some gypsum.

00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:52.170
This is if you had a
commercial brewery,

00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:54.150
you'd have some
pallets of this stuff.

00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:57.030
You can rip them open,
adjust the mineral content

00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:59.220
inside of your beers,
depending on what type of beer

00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:00.011
that you're making.

00:39:00.011 --> 00:39:02.020
So let's say,
generally speaking,

00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:04.510
you want to make a light lager.

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:07.650
You would make the water as
soft as possible least mineral

00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:08.900
content.

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:10.650
And if you were making
a hop forward beer,

00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:14.820
you would use lots of minerals
in there to interact with hops.

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:16.000
OK.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:16.500
Yeast.

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:19.470
So yeast I think is
very fun, and it's also

00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:21.420
kind of the unsung
hero of beer, and it's

00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:24.220
where a lot of the
qualities of beer come from.

00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:28.230
It's maybe a boring
topic to the uninitiated,

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:30.330
but when you learn of
all its magic qualities,

00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:33.810
you guys will be very
excited about yeast.

00:39:33.810 --> 00:39:35.730
So there are two
different types of yeast

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:38.859
out there in the world,
and they are what?

00:39:38.859 --> 00:39:39.858
AUDIENCE: Ale and lager.

00:39:39.858 --> 00:39:41.275
DAVE ADAMS: Boom,
ales and lagers.

00:39:41.275 --> 00:39:43.191
That means there's two
different types of beer

00:39:43.191 --> 00:39:44.150
out there in the world.

00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:46.774
So if you ever thought there was
like a million different types

00:39:46.774 --> 00:39:47.700
of beer, there isn't.

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:48.630
There's just two.

00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:50.420
It's ales and lagers.

00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:53.950
The difference between the
two is that ale yeast--

00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:55.820
so they both produce
three qualities.

00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:57.060
I should say that first.

00:39:57.060 --> 00:40:01.440
They both produce
CO2, esters, and--

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:02.340
AUDIENCE: Alcohol.

00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:05.950
DAVE ADAMS: Alcohol, right,
the thing we all love.

00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:08.610
Wait, what?

00:40:08.610 --> 00:40:12.720
So these three qualities are--

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:15.600
they flow through both
of these types of yeast,

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:18.930
but the ester
production in ale yeast

00:40:18.930 --> 00:40:22.380
is very extreme, as to where the
ester production in lager yeast

00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:24.050
is almost nonexistent.

00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:26.370
What are esters, you
may be wondering.

00:40:26.370 --> 00:40:29.190
Esters are natural, fruity
compounds and flavors

00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:31.230
that come out during
the brewing process,

00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:33.900
and it's really what makes
yeast kind of the unsung hero.

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:37.345
Besides making all the alcohol
in the beer, like I'm sure we

00:40:37.345 --> 00:40:38.970
probably, none of
you, would drink beer

00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:40.330
if it didn't have alcohol in it.

00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:44.670
But besides that, a lot
of the flavors and aromas

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:47.220
that you get out of beer
come from the yeast.

00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:50.970
And a lot of the specific
styles that you like,

00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:53.730
if they didn't use the
yeast that they did,

00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:55.660
then they wouldn't be
that style of beer.

00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:57.070
So think about it this way.

00:40:57.070 --> 00:40:59.670
If you were to have a
true German hefeweizen

00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:02.580
like from Ayinger, Francis
Kahn, or something like that,

00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:04.890
they use a German weizen yeast.

00:41:04.890 --> 00:41:09.180
And that has a special kind
of clove and banana-like aroma

00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:13.870
that comes from the yeast
only, just from fermentation

00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:15.340
those qualities
naturally come out.

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:16.840
They don't add
any bananas to it.

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:18.280
They don't add any clove to it.

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:19.270
That's all it is.

00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:22.360
If that beard did not
use that type of yeast,

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:23.800
it would not be that beer.

00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:25.450
Same thing goes
with Belgian beers.

00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:27.780
How many of like Belgian
beers in the room?

00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:30.250
OK, and I'm talking
about real Belgian beers

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:33.130
like Trappist-style beers,
Belgian quadruples, triples,

00:41:33.130 --> 00:41:34.690
doubles, all that kind of stuff.

00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:38.380
Those types of beers use a
special type of yeast strain

00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:40.180
that has a banana
quality to it, that

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:42.160
comes out during the
fermentation process.

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:44.620
So all the beers that
you try in that category

00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:48.970
are all going to have, basically
speaking, that type of aroma.

00:41:48.970 --> 00:41:51.280
Without that, it's
not that type of beer.

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:55.690
So yeast really makes
the beer what it is.

00:41:55.690 --> 00:41:58.000
Without that type of yeast,
without that special type

00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:58.590
of yeast--

00:41:58.590 --> 00:42:00.100
and you could use a
different type of yeast,

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:01.960
and it would be a
totally different beer.

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:06.910
If I took the entire recipe
for a Belgian-style quadruple,

00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:11.860
and I used a English
ale yeast on it,

00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:14.290
let's say, it would
not taste anything

00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:15.580
like a Belgian quadrupole.

00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:18.190
And you would wonder
why I made this beer

00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:20.290
and called it a
Belgian quadruple.

00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:23.650
So very important that we use
the correct types of yeast,

00:42:23.650 --> 00:42:25.870
and there's hundreds of
different types of yeast

00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:26.720
out there.

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:31.210
So the ale yeast works
from about 68 to 72 degrees

00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:33.940
Fahrenheit, and lager
yeast works from about 45

00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:35.560
to 55 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:38.650
And lager yeast, a lot of times
people think that lagers--

00:42:38.650 --> 00:42:42.118
what do you think
of when I say lager?

00:42:42.118 --> 00:42:43.152
AUDIENCE: Budweiser.

00:42:43.152 --> 00:42:43.860
DAVE ADAMS: Yeah.

00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:47.920
You think mostly like lighter,
easy-drinking American adjunct

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:48.520
lagers--

00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:50.762
Bud, Miller, Coors,
things like that.

00:42:50.762 --> 00:42:52.220
But the reality of
the situation is

00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:55.070
you can use whatever
type of yeast

00:42:55.070 --> 00:42:57.660
that you want in whatever
type of beer that you want.

00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:00.440
So if I made this
crazy imperial stout,

00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:02.840
and I wanted to put a lager
yeast on it instead of an ale

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:04.550
yeast, I could totally do that.

00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:08.390
And it'd be a very strong
and aggressive dark beer,

00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:10.670
but it would just not
have the same esters

00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:12.920
that the ale yeast would have.

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:15.140
So like a Baltic porter
is a great example.

00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:20.240
Baltic porter is about a
8% to 10% imperial porter,

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:22.957
black in color, but
it uses lager yeast,

00:43:22.957 --> 00:43:24.040
so a little bit different.

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:24.680
Right?

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:27.080
Different aromatic
qualities because of it.

00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:33.240
So don't write off
lagers, because they're

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:35.790
lagers, and don't write off
beers because of their color.

00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:36.500
OK?

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:38.800
There's two things to
walk away with this from.

00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:40.641
Any questions on yeast?

00:43:40.641 --> 00:43:42.140
Oh, you know what
else I should say?

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:43.680
Sorry.

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:47.160
That the amount of time that it
takes to ferment the product.

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:50.030
So for ale yeast, it
takes about one week

00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:51.890
to ferment out a
product, from start

00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:55.620
to finish, and lager yeast, it
takes about a month and a half.

00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:57.200
So a significantly
different time

00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:59.242
because of the different
operating temperatures.

00:43:59.242 --> 00:44:00.200
What was your question?

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:01.598
AUDIENCE: Does
White Lab still do

00:44:01.598 --> 00:44:04.394
that tasting thing where they
same recipe different yeast

00:44:04.394 --> 00:44:05.330
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:44:05.330 --> 00:44:07.550
DAVE ADAMS: So the question
was does White Lab still

00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:12.110
do a tasting panel
with different worts

00:44:12.110 --> 00:44:13.820
that they put
different yeast on,

00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:15.530
and I believe the answer is yes.

00:44:15.530 --> 00:44:18.800
White Labs, if you don't
know, is a yeast facility

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:21.700
that's up off of Miramar
Road, fairly close to us,

00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:22.770
if you're in San Diego.

00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:23.809
So head out there.

00:44:23.809 --> 00:44:24.350
Check it out.

00:44:24.350 --> 00:44:25.610
It's really cool.

00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:29.600
Wort is basically the beer
that hasn't had yeast on it yet

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:30.830
and hasn't turned into beer.

00:44:30.830 --> 00:44:33.320
So they'll make
one type of wort,

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:35.390
like let's say a pale
ale wort, and they'll

00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:38.720
put a German weizen yeast on
it and a Trappist Belgian-style

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:40.960
yeast on it and an
English ale yeast on it

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:42.410
and an America yeast on it.

00:44:42.410 --> 00:44:45.049
And that way you can see what
those different qualities

00:44:45.049 --> 00:44:47.090
are that I'm talking about,
in regards to esters.

00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:50.230
It's actually a really cool
little science experiment.

00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:51.650
OK, any other
questions on yeast?

00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:52.010
Yes.

00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:53.978
AUDIENCE: I've heard
that White Labs produces

00:44:53.978 --> 00:44:57.914
itself the majority of
brewers yeast that's

00:44:57.914 --> 00:44:59.390
used for craft breweries.

00:44:59.390 --> 00:45:00.005
Is that true?

00:45:00.005 --> 00:45:01.380
DAVE ADAMS: The
question was does

00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:03.840
White Labs produce the
majority of yeast that's

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:06.000
used for craft breweries?

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:06.730
I don't know.

00:45:06.730 --> 00:45:09.600
There's also Wyeast,
and there's also Omega,

00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:12.370
and they both make quality
products that are used.

00:45:12.370 --> 00:45:16.080
I think that maybe on the west
coast White Labs is used more.

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:18.990
I think Omega and Wyeast are
used more on the east coast,

00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:21.780
and we're starting to see people
switch over to those especially

00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:25.720
for barrel-aged beers and sour
beers and things like that.

00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:28.170
I think for American ale yeasts
and California ale yeasts

00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:29.544
and stuff like
that, you'll still

00:45:29.544 --> 00:45:32.880
see a lot of White Labs
canisters and breweries.

00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:33.540
OK?

00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:34.730
What else?

00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:36.044
Anything else?

00:45:36.044 --> 00:45:38.529
AUDIENCE: What's the scale
of your yeast purchases,

00:45:38.529 --> 00:45:40.020
for 50 barrels, let's say.

00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:41.853
DAVE ADAMS: That's
actually a good question.

00:45:41.853 --> 00:45:44.340
What's the scale of yeast
purchases for 50 barrels?

00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:46.800
So what we do, and what
most breweries will do,

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:50.490
will actually be to buy a
pitchable batch for a much

00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:52.695
smaller batch and then
we'll propagate it up

00:45:52.695 --> 00:45:54.070
to build it up to
a bigger batch.

00:45:54.070 --> 00:45:59.310
So we usually brew 250 barrel
tanks, or 500 kegs at a time.

00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:00.760
Our brewhouse is 50 barrels.

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:03.510
So we 5 times into the
fermenter, but what we'll do

00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:05.670
is divert an amount
of wort, usually

00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:08.990
about 100 barrels, 80 to
100 barrels, into a smaller

00:46:08.990 --> 00:46:09.510
fermenter.

00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:12.390
We'll pitch that yeast
in there, let it build up

00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:16.110
to 100 barrel batch, and then
we can pitch it into the 250

00:46:16.110 --> 00:46:17.820
after that, and we can reuse it.

00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:19.680
For about 10
generations, it still

00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:22.380
has the amount of cells
that we need to reuse it

00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:23.520
for that amount of time.

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:26.040
After that, it starts
mutating, and it

00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:28.330
doesn't have the qualities
that we want it to anymore.

00:46:28.330 --> 00:46:30.850
So we have to toss it
out, but pretty cool.

00:46:30.850 --> 00:46:32.580
We can use it a bunch of times.

00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:34.700
Any more questions?

00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:35.982
OK.

00:46:35.982 --> 00:46:39.270
Oh, that's what yeast looks
like, little fluffy balls

00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:41.910
of joy.

00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:46.530
OK, let's talk about the brewing
process, so one slide here.

00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:48.270
So all of the ingredients
that you learn,

00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:50.103
we'll talk about how
to use them real quick.

00:46:50.103 --> 00:46:54.000
So in the top right corner
there, you'll see the mill.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.580
So what we do is we take all
that malted barley, whatever

00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:58.080
we're going to use
to make the beer,

00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:01.890
be it all two-row pale malt or
a mixture of 10 different malts,

00:47:01.890 --> 00:47:04.920
whatever we want to do, we
grind it all up in a mill.

00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:07.860
So the way that you see
that bag that came around,

00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:10.990
that is how the malt
comes to us basically.

00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:12.930
And then we put it
inside of this mill that

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:15.870
grinds it up and cracks
into the kernels for us,

00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:19.680
and the reason why is so we can
access those starches much more

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:22.260
easily and the enzymes
that are inside of it.

00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:24.480
So we crack it up,
we get it inside

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:27.290
of the first vessel, which
is called the mash mixer.

00:47:27.290 --> 00:47:30.360
So if you're in a smaller
home brew kind of operation

00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:31.980
or a smaller
brewery, you'll have

00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:36.300
a mash up like a mash-lauter
combo, where you'll see

00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:38.190
something called the mash tun.

00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:40.890
In a larger, more
commercial brewery,

00:47:40.890 --> 00:47:43.710
you'll see those
two tanks separated.

00:47:43.710 --> 00:47:46.770
So at our brewery, this
is what it looks like.

00:47:46.770 --> 00:47:48.690
The mash mixer is
the tank where you

00:47:48.690 --> 00:47:50.520
spark the enzymatic reaction.

00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:52.710
So you dump all the
malted barley in there,

00:47:52.710 --> 00:47:55.524
you hit it with your hot
water, you spin it around.

00:47:55.524 --> 00:47:56.940
If you were making
it at home, you

00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:59.790
do it on a big pot on the stove,
and you just churn it around

00:47:59.790 --> 00:48:00.390
with a spoon.

00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:02.014
That's all you'd have
to do, and that's

00:48:02.014 --> 00:48:03.960
the mash mixer part of it.

00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:07.410
After that, we're going to take
everything inside of that tank

00:48:07.410 --> 00:48:09.410
and put it into the lautertun.

00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:11.430
The lautertun is
the tank where we're

00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:15.014
going to extract the malted
barley out of it, because we

00:48:15.014 --> 00:48:15.930
don't need it anymore.

00:48:15.930 --> 00:48:18.150
We only need it for the
very first step in order

00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:20.670
to get all of the
fermentable sugars out

00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:23.029
of it and all the colors
that we wanted out of it.

00:48:23.029 --> 00:48:25.320
So we do a couple of different
things in the lautertun.

00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:27.330
Those little dots
on the bottom of it,

00:48:27.330 --> 00:48:29.460
those actually represent
a false bottom.

00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:33.240
So it has a bunch of
actually slots through it

00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:35.190
and grates over
the top, and that

00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:38.850
allows the liquid to seep
through the bottom of the tank.

00:48:38.850 --> 00:48:41.670
And the grain will stay
on the top of the tank,

00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:44.880
and then at the same time, we
will do what's called sparging.

00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:47.910
Sparge means to rinse, and
we are going to rinse off

00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:49.170
each of those barley kernels.

00:48:49.170 --> 00:48:51.330
We're also going
to be adding water,

00:48:51.330 --> 00:48:53.220
so we can reduce it later on.

00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:55.680
We get those reduction
of flavors going.

00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:57.360
So we add a bunch
of water in there,

00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:58.980
we rinse off all
those kernels so we

00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:00.900
can get every little
piece of sugar

00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:03.570
that we possibly can off
there, and then it heads over

00:49:03.570 --> 00:49:05.799
to a boil kettle after that.

00:49:05.799 --> 00:49:07.590
There's a couple of
different ways to boil.

00:49:07.590 --> 00:49:09.930
You can either use
direct fire, that's

00:49:09.930 --> 00:49:11.850
what you'd use if
you were at home,

00:49:11.850 --> 00:49:16.260
and you had a little jet
burner, a little stand

00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:18.360
burner that you put the pot on.

00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:21.390
At a commercial brewery, most
of the time you use steam.

00:49:21.390 --> 00:49:25.260
So that little unit inside that
has the number three on it,

00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:26.850
that's called the calandria.

00:49:26.850 --> 00:49:30.720
And inside of that calandria
is a series of about 100 tubes,

00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:32.700
and they're all heated by steam.

00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:34.436
And what happens
is the wort sucks

00:49:34.436 --> 00:49:36.060
in through the bottom
of that calandria

00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:39.360
and kind of gets flash boiled
by each of those metal tubes.

00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:42.570
And then it hits that top hat
and boils out onto itself.

00:49:42.570 --> 00:49:44.760
So it constantly goes
up through the middle

00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:46.360
and boils out to the outside.

00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:48.801
That way we can get a nice
even rolling boil going.

00:49:48.801 --> 00:49:50.550
You know when you're
making pasta at home,

00:49:50.550 --> 00:49:52.440
and it starts bubbling
and really going,

00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:53.820
that's a rolling boil.

00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:55.270
So we want to get that going.

00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:56.830
It's very important
to get that going

00:49:56.830 --> 00:49:58.430
for three different reasons.

00:49:58.430 --> 00:50:01.600
One is we're going to sanitize
the beer, very important

00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:05.020
so we don't die that we drink
the beer that is sanitized.

00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:08.950
It's also why-- a big
reason, historically,

00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:10.900
why we're all
still alive today--

00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:13.380
it's also why the Mayflower
landed where it did.

00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:15.640
So it's very important
back in the day

00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:17.830
that you had beer
on your adventures,

00:50:17.830 --> 00:50:20.140
and part of the reason
was because the water was

00:50:20.140 --> 00:50:23.031
filled with dysentery and
other bacteria contamination.

00:50:23.031 --> 00:50:25.030
So if you had water, and
that was the only thing

00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:26.890
you had to drink, you died.

00:50:26.890 --> 00:50:28.330
And if you had beer--

00:50:28.330 --> 00:50:29.720
they didn't know
it at the time--

00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:32.210
but it was sanitized
through the boiling process,

00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:34.390
and because of the yeast
that was in there, creating

00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:35.620
alcohol and things like that.

00:50:35.620 --> 00:50:39.320
So everybody drank beer, because
you drink beer, you live.

00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:40.870
You drink water, you die.

00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:42.982
So it was a very
easy proposition.

00:50:42.982 --> 00:50:44.290
Right?

00:50:44.290 --> 00:50:46.440
So most of the time,
the beer back then,

00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:50.440
what we think of as the beer
now is a very social structure

00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:51.010
to it.

00:50:51.010 --> 00:50:52.150
We go out to the bars.

00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:53.282
We go to the tasting rooms.

00:50:53.282 --> 00:50:54.490
We hang out with our friends.

00:50:54.490 --> 00:50:55.200
We geek out.

00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:57.980
We yell at our friends for
using hoppy, things like that.

00:50:57.980 --> 00:51:01.930
But back then, it was 2% 2 1/2%.

00:51:01.930 --> 00:51:02.842
The kids drank it.

00:51:02.842 --> 00:51:03.550
Parents drank it.

00:51:03.550 --> 00:51:06.620
Everybody drank it, because
it had vitamins, minerals,

00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:10.000
and sustenance, and it didn't
kill you, very important part.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.580
So we boil it, so it don't
die, first of all, sanitize it.

00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:16.224
The second part is so we can
get a reduction of the flavors,

00:51:16.224 --> 00:51:17.140
which we talked about.

00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:19.120
Just like you're
making a nice wine

00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:22.720
sauce on your stove at home,
we want to reduce the flavors,

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:25.850
so we can intensify them,
same idea that we're doing.

00:51:25.850 --> 00:51:28.090
And then the third
reason is because we want

00:51:28.090 --> 00:51:30.070
to interact with these hops.

00:51:30.070 --> 00:51:33.860
So when we put the hops
in, right at the beginning,

00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:35.920
you're going to get the
part of the lupulin gland

00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:38.710
that has the resins in it
is going to be extracted.

00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:41.710
They're isomerized
in boiling liquid,

00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:43.300
or they become water soluble.

00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:46.300
So that breaks down
the acids in the hops,

00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:48.259
and it returns bitterness.

00:51:48.259 --> 00:51:50.050
So if you want to make
a super bitter beer,

00:51:50.050 --> 00:51:51.850
then you add a bunch
of high alpha acid

00:51:51.850 --> 00:51:53.860
hops at the very
beginning of the boil,

00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:55.930
and you end up with
a lot of bitterness.

00:51:55.930 --> 00:51:57.550
If you don't want
as much bitterness,

00:51:57.550 --> 00:51:58.760
then you can do two things.

00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:02.810
You can either use a hop that
has a lot lower alpha acid,

00:52:02.810 --> 00:52:04.810
a lot lower level
of bitterness, maybe

00:52:04.810 --> 00:52:07.750
4% or 5% alpha
acid instead of 20,

00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:09.130
and you can dump them in then.

00:52:09.130 --> 00:52:11.650
Or you can just not do
a first hop addition

00:52:11.650 --> 00:52:13.660
and do them later
on in the boil.

00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:15.520
Because the less
time that the hops

00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:19.030
have to break down
in this rolling boil,

00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:22.200
the less of the acids that
they're going to extract.

00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:24.230
A tricky part about
the boil though,

00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:27.010
is that the essential oils
are extremely delicate.

00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:28.870
So all those beautiful
flavors and aromas

00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:30.520
that come out from
the essential oils

00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:32.260
that we got to
smell earlier, those

00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:34.750
will get boiled off really
quickly when you use them

00:52:34.750 --> 00:52:38.432
in the first part or for
the majority of the boil.

00:52:38.432 --> 00:52:40.390
When you're home brewing,
and things like that,

00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:43.000
you'll hear a lot of terms
like late edition hops.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:44.740
That means that you
do it at the very end

00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:46.030
of the boiling process.

00:52:46.030 --> 00:52:48.849
That way you get the most
essential oil extraction

00:52:48.849 --> 00:52:49.390
that you can.

00:52:49.390 --> 00:52:51.400
You get the most
aroma that you can.

00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:55.960
After that, we do another
step called the whirlpool.

00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:59.560
In the whirlpool, the wort
will shoot in at an angle

00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:02.334
and spin around in a
circle, just like whirlpool.

00:53:02.334 --> 00:53:04.000
Before that happens,
especially if we're

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.920
making a hop forward
beer, we're going

00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:09.190
to put a big bed of hops
inside of that whirlpool.

00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:11.790
And it's going to spin around
and pick up all those hops

00:53:11.790 --> 00:53:13.360
throughout, and
it's going to create

00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:15.096
some nice flavors,
some nice aroma,

00:53:15.096 --> 00:53:17.470
we'll get a little color pick
up from it spinning around.

00:53:17.470 --> 00:53:20.530
We're not actively
boiling during this part,

00:53:20.530 --> 00:53:23.539
it's in the low 200
degree Fahrenheit range,

00:53:23.539 --> 00:53:25.580
and then we're going to
get rid of it from there.

00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:29.380
So this is called the hot
side or the brew house.

00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:31.825
A lot of people think
that the fermentation area

00:53:31.825 --> 00:53:34.630
is the brewhouse, but
this is all called

00:53:34.630 --> 00:53:37.020
the hot side or the brewhouse.

00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:39.310
It's where all the stuff
on your stove at home

00:53:39.310 --> 00:53:40.720
would happened, basically.

00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:44.440
After that, we're going to move
all the wort into the cellar.

00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:46.986
The cellar is where
the magic happens.

00:53:46.986 --> 00:53:48.610
That's where the
yeast gets introduced.

00:53:48.610 --> 00:53:50.140
That's where beer becomes beer.

00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:53.410
Because all the brewers do
is make hoppy sugar water,

00:53:53.410 --> 00:53:56.770
and then the yeast makes beer,
very important to remember.

00:53:56.770 --> 00:53:58.870
Whenever brewers are
feeling high and mighty,

00:53:58.870 --> 00:54:03.320
just tell them that, and they
get real sad, real quick.

00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:05.890
So the last thing
is that little grate

00:54:05.890 --> 00:54:08.770
at the bottom of the
whirlpool is a heat exchanger.

00:54:08.770 --> 00:54:15.850
So we want to make the 210,
212 degree hoppy sugar water 72

00:54:15.850 --> 00:54:18.311
degree hoppy sugar water,
so we can ferment it over

00:54:18.311 --> 00:54:19.060
on the other side.

00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:20.882
We don't have mass
genocide of our yeast

00:54:20.882 --> 00:54:22.090
when we go put it over there.

00:54:22.090 --> 00:54:24.810
Because we put 200 degree
wort inside of this fermenter

00:54:24.810 --> 00:54:27.444
with a bunch of yeast, they'd
all die and be real sad.

00:54:27.444 --> 00:54:28.360
So we don't want that.

00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:32.620
We put it over there, and we get
it to 72 degrees very rapidly,

00:54:32.620 --> 00:54:35.660
takes just a couple of minutes
to get it down that quickly.

00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:37.660
And then when we get it
inside of the fermenter,

00:54:37.660 --> 00:54:40.720
we dump the yeast inside of
there, and we let it go crazy.

00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:42.730
Very important that
there's little oxygen

00:54:42.730 --> 00:54:45.140
pick up during this process.

00:54:45.140 --> 00:54:46.929
And once the yeast
starts working,

00:54:46.929 --> 00:54:48.970
it's going to start creating
all those byproducts

00:54:48.970 --> 00:54:50.620
that we talked
about, and then you

00:54:50.620 --> 00:54:52.660
end up with beer afterwards.

00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:55.570
There are some more
steps that we could

00:54:55.570 --> 00:54:56.900
talk forever and ever about.

00:54:56.900 --> 00:54:59.320
But basically after
that, you're going

00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:01.810
to dry hop it is the most
important one that I want

00:55:01.810 --> 00:55:03.730
to talk about, since
hop forward beers are

00:55:03.730 --> 00:55:07.120
very popular in Southern
California, especially.

00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:10.030
And dry hopping means you--

00:55:10.030 --> 00:55:12.940
it's very confusing, because
there's nothing dry about it--

00:55:12.940 --> 00:55:15.820
but you're basically taking a
bunch of hops, at the very end,

00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:17.530
after the beer has
been fermented.

00:55:17.530 --> 00:55:18.490
It's ready to roll.

00:55:18.490 --> 00:55:20.440
It could head over to
the filtration area

00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:22.739
if you wanted it
to, but instead, you

00:55:22.739 --> 00:55:24.280
throw a whole bunch
of hops in there.

00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:26.980
And the reason why is so we can
get the other part of the hop

00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:29.110
out, the essential oil out.

00:55:29.110 --> 00:55:33.100
And this is where the
majority, the large majority,

00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:36.430
of all the hop aroma that you
smell in a hop forward beer

00:55:36.430 --> 00:55:38.470
is going to come
from, the dry hop.

00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:41.872
So post fermentation hopping,
dump a bunch hops in there,

00:55:41.872 --> 00:55:43.330
you get all those
beautiful aromas,

00:55:43.330 --> 00:55:46.000
just like you guys
got to smell earlier.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.970
After that, we're going to take
the beer into the filtration

00:55:48.970 --> 00:55:52.300
area, and here you can do all
kinds of different features

00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:53.300
to filter the beer.

00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:55.720
We can put it through
a centrifuge which

00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:58.300
is just a light filtration
to it, a machine that

00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:01.150
spins around really quickly
and takes out any major solids.

00:56:01.150 --> 00:56:03.250
We can also send it
through a plate and frame

00:56:03.250 --> 00:56:06.120
filter which is charged with
diatomaceous earth which

00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:07.990
are made up of little
ground up diatoms

00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:11.720
that help trap spent yeast
and other protein bonds.

00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:13.660
And what that means
in basic terminology

00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:17.560
is that it makes the beer clear,
because protein bonds, proteins

00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:19.990
that bond together is
what makes beer cloudy,

00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:22.190
in its most basic terms.

00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:25.300
So if you have a very
highly hopped beer or lots

00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:27.380
of yeast residue or
things like that,

00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:28.900
that's what makes a beer cloudy.

00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:31.750
And by sending it through this
diatomaceous earth filter,

00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:33.010
it strips those out.

00:56:33.010 --> 00:56:35.890
Some people think that it strips
out some flavor, and that's

00:56:35.890 --> 00:56:39.320
definitely true, some flavor
and aroma, it's definitely true.

00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:44.200
But there's also a shelf life
and a stability advantage

00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:47.410
to stripping your
beer down very clear.

00:56:47.410 --> 00:56:50.410
It doesn't mean that it has to
be-- some beers have just less

00:56:50.410 --> 00:56:52.960
stuff going on in them,
and you can send it just

00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:54.400
through the
centrifuge and end up

00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:56.680
with a fairly clear
beer that doesn't

00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:58.300
go through a heavy polish.

00:56:58.300 --> 00:57:01.600
And some beer needs to really
go through that heavy polish.

00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:03.370
It also depends on
the style of the beer.

00:57:03.370 --> 00:57:05.860
Some beers are meant to be
very cloudy in appearance,

00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:08.679
and some beers should
look bright and clear.

00:57:08.679 --> 00:57:09.970
That's just the way that it is.

00:57:09.970 --> 00:57:11.130
OK, yes?

00:57:11.130 --> 00:57:13.630
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:16.110 --> 00:57:18.610
DAVE ADAMS: The question was
is that where the body the beer

00:57:18.610 --> 00:57:19.810
comes from?

00:57:19.810 --> 00:57:21.580
No, not necessarily.

00:57:21.580 --> 00:57:24.730
It does have a
role to play in it,

00:57:24.730 --> 00:57:27.400
but the body will mostly
come from the residual sugar

00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:29.890
content that's in the beer,
the alcohol content that's

00:57:29.890 --> 00:57:30.610
in the beer.

00:57:30.610 --> 00:57:34.300
The effervescence of the beer
is very important to the body.

00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:35.890
I mean, even to
the degree where it

00:57:35.890 --> 00:57:38.500
can make a beer taste
much lighter in alcohol

00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:40.180
or much heavier in alcohol.

00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:43.780
If you had a beer that was 9%
alcohol that had a bunch of CO2

00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:46.490
in it, you would think that
it's maybe 7% in alcohol.

00:57:46.490 --> 00:57:49.570
So a lot of the body comes
from those characteristics.

00:57:49.570 --> 00:57:51.520
There can be some
body that comes

00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:53.920
from less filtration
or more filtration,

00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:55.120
but usually that's not good.

00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:57.910
If you're picking up body
qualities from not filtering,

00:57:57.910 --> 00:58:00.010
it's usually a chalky
quality, because you

00:58:00.010 --> 00:58:02.780
have too much particulate
that's leftover in there.

00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:04.630
So there's a lot of
those, like the beers

00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:11.740
nowadays, like the hazy IPAs and
things like that, some of those

00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:14.500
are coming from the mineral
content in the water,

00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:17.347
and it's interaction with the
yeast and things like that.

00:58:17.347 --> 00:58:19.180
But if you're getting
it because you're just

00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:21.160
leaving a bunch of
sludge in the beer,

00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:23.060
then that's not a
good way to do it.

00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:24.970
And it's not a
good representation

00:58:24.970 --> 00:58:27.070
of the beer afterwards,
and it also really

00:58:27.070 --> 00:58:28.750
hurts shelf life quite a bit.

00:58:28.750 --> 00:58:31.810
So it's perfectly fine to
unfilter your beer completely,

00:58:31.810 --> 00:58:34.480
but all you have-- it's really
hard to make a super cloudy

00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:36.577
beer on purpose,
because if you just

00:58:36.577 --> 00:58:38.410
let it sit in the tank
for a couple of days.

00:58:38.410 --> 00:58:40.480
It really just
settles out by itself,

00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:43.260
and it becomes a relatively
clear beer after that.

00:58:43.260 --> 00:58:45.010
So you've got to really
go out of your way

00:58:45.010 --> 00:58:47.880
to make a very
muddy, sludgy beer.

00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:50.400
And if you're doing it the
right way, it can add some--

00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:53.930
what it will do is just not
take away any of the aroma.

00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:57.160
So really those beers that are
like the hazy, murky IPAs--

00:58:57.160 --> 00:58:59.530
or whatever you
want to call them--

00:58:59.530 --> 00:59:03.580
they are beers that have low
bitterness and high, dry hop

00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:09.700
qualities and are not filtered
very much, and that's it.

00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:13.750
OK, any other questions
about the brewing process?

00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:14.657
Yes?

00:59:14.657 --> 00:59:16.605
AUDIENCE: When do they
add the cilantro or any

00:59:16.605 --> 00:59:19.507
of the other ingredients?

00:59:19.507 --> 00:59:20.840
DAVE ADAMS: Yeah, good question.

00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:24.400
The question was, when do
they add spices to the beers?

00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:25.960
You mentioned cilantro.

00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:27.850
Usually, you'll see
things like orange peel

00:59:27.850 --> 00:59:32.120
and grains of paradise
and things like that.

00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:35.410
Most of those are added
in the whirlpool addition,

00:59:35.410 --> 00:59:38.230
or you can add them
post fermentation,

00:59:38.230 --> 00:59:40.000
similar to dry hopping.

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:42.520
And the reason why you
do them a different way

00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:46.010
is because, basically, if
they're aseptic or not.

00:59:46.010 --> 00:59:48.340
So if you have it or if
it's already aseptic,

00:59:48.340 --> 00:59:50.950
and it has no bacterial
contamination,

00:59:50.950 --> 00:59:52.750
you can add it in
post fermentation.

00:59:52.750 --> 00:59:54.250
But if you're going
to add something

00:59:54.250 --> 00:59:57.520
in post fermentation that
hasn't been sterilized already,

00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:00.490
then you have the chance of
bacterial contamination, which

01:00:00.490 --> 01:00:02.170
is why you wouldn't do that.

01:00:02.170 --> 01:00:04.650
And that's when you add it
into the whirlpool side,

01:00:04.650 --> 01:00:07.862
because it will sterilize the
ingredients that you're using.

01:00:07.862 --> 01:00:09.320
But if they're
delicate ingredients

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:11.740
it could also not
get the flavors

01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:14.998
that you want out of
it because of that.

01:00:14.998 --> 01:00:19.247
AUDIENCE: How do you control
the yeast of a wild beer?

01:00:19.247 --> 01:00:20.580
DAVE ADAMS: Yeah, good question.

01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:22.871
The question was how do you
control the yeast of a wild

01:00:22.871 --> 01:00:25.790
beer, and the answer is
pretty much, you don't.

01:00:25.790 --> 01:00:28.850
You can control it with
the amount that you pitch,

01:00:28.850 --> 01:00:30.600
and you control it
with the sugar content.

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:32.266
You can control it
with the temperature,

01:00:32.266 --> 01:00:33.860
just like you would
any other yeast,

01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:36.860
but it can be
difficult to control

01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:39.440
and they do kind of have a
mind of their own at times.

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:43.440
It's not as difficult as
working with bacteria,

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:46.730
especially pediococcus But
like lactobacillus delbrueckii

01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:49.880
that you'll see in a lot
of kettle-soured beers

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:52.400
and a lot of just
most sour beers

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:54.920
in general use
lactobacillus delbrueckii.

01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:58.430
That is fairly easy
to control, but I

01:00:58.430 --> 01:01:00.410
would say that it's
a sliding scale of--

01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:02.780
or that the scale
ramps up in volume

01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:07.280
from like Brettanomyces,
that wild yeast strain,

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:11.600
would be here, and then
it would be lactobacillus

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:13.820
and then it would be
pediococcus after that.

01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:17.810
Those get much more difficult
as you go up into the bacteria

01:01:17.810 --> 01:01:19.350
phase of things.

01:01:19.350 --> 01:01:22.490
Especially because they interact
with each other and other

01:01:22.490 --> 01:01:25.055
ingredients in the beer,
and they're just overall

01:01:25.055 --> 01:01:27.950
a real pain in the ass.

01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:29.497
Any other questions?

01:01:29.497 --> 01:01:31.746
AUDIENCE: How come sterilization
is not a problem when

01:01:31.746 --> 01:01:32.704
you do the dry hopping?

01:01:32.704 --> 01:01:35.807
You talked about throwing other
random things [INAUDIBLE]..

01:01:35.807 --> 01:01:37.140
DAVE ADAMS: Yeah, good question.

01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:39.223
The question was how come
throwing a bunch of hops

01:01:39.223 --> 01:01:42.350
in post fermentation doesn't
cause a bunch trouble?

01:01:42.350 --> 01:01:44.930
The hops are already
fairly sterilized,

01:01:44.930 --> 01:01:47.330
and they also have
anti-microbial and

01:01:47.330 --> 01:01:49.407
anti-bacterial
qualities to them,

01:01:49.407 --> 01:01:50.990
and they were actually
originally used

01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:53.450
in beer for that
specific quality.

01:01:53.450 --> 01:01:56.550
Actually even today,
lambic-style beers,

01:01:56.550 --> 01:01:59.090
which are naturally,
spontaneously fermented

01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:01.910
beers from the Lambic
region of Belgium, which

01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:04.100
are very rare and
hard to find and taste

01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:05.900
really weird and
funky, and they have

01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:08.430
tons of different wild
yeasts and bacteria in them.

01:02:08.430 --> 01:02:12.390
They don't have any hints of
west coast-style hop profiles

01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:12.890
to them.

01:02:12.890 --> 01:02:14.540
They use tons of
hops in their beer,

01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:16.070
but they're all aged hops.

01:02:16.070 --> 01:02:19.340
So they just let them sit out,
and then all the acids and oils

01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:21.080
get out of them, and
they only use them

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:22.550
for preservative qualities.

01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:26.278
Other questions?

01:02:29.870 --> 01:02:34.040
Sensory evaluation, what
we all want to talk about.

01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:38.210
So we're basically going to go
through the whole sensory part

01:02:38.210 --> 01:02:41.840
for everybody that's
watching, and then we're

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:44.720
going to break from presentation
and go drink beer after that.

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:46.340
I hope that works for everybody.

01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:46.970
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:02:46.970 --> 01:02:48.410
DAVE ADAMS: OK, great.

01:02:48.410 --> 01:02:52.070
All right, so sensory
evaluation, before we get

01:02:52.070 --> 01:02:55.730
started the reason why I think
that this is very important

01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:57.620
is because we all drink beer.

01:02:57.620 --> 01:03:00.140
And we all drink stuff
and eat stuff in general.

01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:00.710
Right?

01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:01.970
And I really want--

01:03:01.970 --> 01:03:07.190
I think that there's a severe
lack of good vocabulary

01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:11.210
out there when talking
about these types of things

01:03:11.210 --> 01:03:12.530
that we ingest.

01:03:12.530 --> 01:03:13.940
And a lot of times,
I hear things

01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:19.760
like good, bad, gross,
I don't like it,

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:23.180
stuff like that, all stuff
that sounds really dumb.

01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:26.450
So we're going to try to
not sound really dumb.

01:03:26.450 --> 01:03:28.940
And I'm going to give you a
whole bunch of fun descriptors,

01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:32.540
and I really want to teach
everybody in the room

01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:38.280
that it's very easy
to describe things,

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:40.670
if you think about
them critically, almost

01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:45.140
regardless of your background.

01:03:45.140 --> 01:03:46.980
Now, it does help--

01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:48.990
there is a caveat--
does help if you're

01:03:48.990 --> 01:03:53.030
an adventurous person
who likes to travel,

01:03:53.030 --> 01:03:56.090
not a picky eater, not a
drinker, things like that.

01:03:56.090 --> 01:03:58.760
Because you'll just have more
life experiences and more

01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:00.315
descriptors to pull from.

01:04:00.315 --> 01:04:03.350
If you're somebody who only eats
hamburgers and French fries,

01:04:03.350 --> 01:04:04.910
and you get it plain every time.

01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:07.190
Or you order something
a specific way,

01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:09.020
and that's the only
thing you eat forever,

01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:09.890
for your whole life.

01:04:09.890 --> 01:04:11.990
You always get a Caesar
salad with the sauce

01:04:11.990 --> 01:04:14.016
on the side and the
croutons, there's only three

01:04:14.016 --> 01:04:15.890
of them placed on the
right side of the plate

01:04:15.890 --> 01:04:16.940
and things like that.

01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:19.640
If you're that kind of
person, it is harder to do,

01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:21.731
but it doesn't mean
that you can't do it.

01:04:21.731 --> 01:04:23.480
And a lot of the
descriptors will actually

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:25.850
come from just the
environment of you

01:04:25.850 --> 01:04:28.190
walking around and
smelling your environment

01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:32.720
and noticing your environment,
be it trees or ground or rain

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:37.170
or all these kind of
senses that come to you,

01:04:37.170 --> 01:04:39.720
especially from an
aromatic standpoint.

01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:42.490
You learn that that's a
very important part of it.

01:04:42.490 --> 01:04:44.630
But the idea is
that a lot of people

01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:47.540
think, especially
from a wine world--

01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:49.940
Has anybody done a wine
tasting in here before?

01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:50.450
OK.

01:04:50.450 --> 01:04:52.730
So especially like from
the wine side of things,

01:04:52.730 --> 01:04:55.790
I think that they really like
to pull out the flavor wheel

01:04:55.790 --> 01:04:58.430
and use a lot of terminology
that you would only

01:04:58.430 --> 01:05:00.320
use if you are
talking to industry

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:02.300
professionals about wine.

01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:04.190
And I think that's
completely useless,

01:05:04.190 --> 01:05:07.430
unless you are an industry
professional about wine.

01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:11.480
So I like to teach
sensory to the public,

01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:15.060
from the sense that they're all
descriptors that we all know,

01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:16.250
that we can all talk about.

01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:18.322
Because it makes sense
and it's more relevant

01:05:18.322 --> 01:05:20.030
if you're out having
dinner with someone,

01:05:20.030 --> 01:05:21.710
or you're out at a
bar with your friends.

01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:23.793
These are all words that
we would use all the time

01:05:23.793 --> 01:05:27.890
and totally know exactly what
they mean without saying,

01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:29.810
you know, something
weird that would only

01:05:29.810 --> 01:05:33.530
be used for a specific
scientific purpose that's

01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:35.566
only inside of the brewhouse.

01:05:35.566 --> 01:05:37.190
No point in saying
something like that.

01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.760
Right?

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:39.260
So that's the idea.

01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:41.960
So I'm going to walk
you through is really

01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:45.440
the structure of how
I like to taste beer,

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:47.130
how I like to break it down.

01:05:47.130 --> 01:05:50.060
And we're going to do a very
kind of regimented version

01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:51.020
of this tasting.

01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:52.460
But it doesn't
mean that you have

01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:54.830
to crack out a pen and paper
every single time that you

01:05:54.830 --> 01:05:57.750
taste something or eat something
or you're out at dinner.

01:05:57.750 --> 01:06:01.580
What it means is just to think
about things in this manner,

01:06:01.580 --> 01:06:06.200
and you will have a better and
easier way of describing them.

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:07.910
Which makes you
a better consumer

01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:10.580
ultimately and
just more educated

01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:12.830
in general about the
things that you ingest.

01:06:12.830 --> 01:06:13.500
Right?

01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:17.210
OK, so first thing is going to
be the appearance of the beer.

01:06:17.210 --> 01:06:21.740
So we want to think of
colors, like golden, amber.

01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:25.130
We want to avoid using
the terms light in dark,

01:06:25.130 --> 01:06:27.170
because they're really
junky descriptors.

01:06:27.170 --> 01:06:30.800
So think of a Crayola
box, think of the rainbow,

01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:33.800
think of colors of things
that you see out in the world,

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:35.810
and those are more
fun descriptors.

01:06:35.810 --> 01:06:37.790
And also keep in mind,
whenever you're making

01:06:37.790 --> 01:06:40.820
these descriptors, the more--

01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:44.330
I call them the prime number
of the explanation, which

01:06:44.330 --> 01:06:46.880
means keep digging
down until it's

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:49.830
the last thing that you can
think of in that explanation.

01:06:49.830 --> 01:06:52.460
So for example,
if you say hoppy,

01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:54.740
the reason why I don't
like saying hoppy

01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:58.100
is because what kind of
hops are you talking about?

01:06:58.100 --> 01:07:01.190
And when in the brewing
process did you use them,

01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:05.210
and are you talking about
bitterness or flavor or aroma?

01:07:05.210 --> 01:07:05.720
Right?

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:08.390
There's a litany of things
that we could talk about.

01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:12.140
If we say hoppy, it's
such a loaded descriptor.

01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:13.970
So what I really would
rather have you say

01:07:13.970 --> 01:07:16.880
is it smells like
standing in a wet forest,

01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:21.260
or it smells like
freshly grated lime zest.

01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:25.070
That is a prime
descriptor right there.

01:07:25.070 --> 01:07:27.590
You are digging down to the
furthest that you can go.

01:07:27.590 --> 01:07:30.710
So you can replace hoppy
with that kind of a thing,

01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:32.750
and the same thing
goes with citrus.

01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:35.750
The same thing goes with
floral, and it's the same reason

01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:38.640
why saying good, bad,
light, and dark all suck.

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:41.030
Because they are not good
descriptors of things,

01:07:41.030 --> 01:07:42.990
because there are
way more detailed

01:07:42.990 --> 01:07:44.350
than better descriptors of them.

01:07:44.350 --> 01:07:44.960
OK?

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:46.760
So think of your creative
writing class out there.

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:47.960
You're all creative people.

01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:50.000
Make it happen.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.260
Head retention will
be another one.

01:07:52.260 --> 01:07:54.656
So this will just be how long
the head stays on the beer.

01:07:54.656 --> 01:07:56.030
So I'll pour a
little bit of beer

01:07:56.030 --> 01:07:58.440
here, so you can see
what I'm talking about.

01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:03.140
So we see that there is a nice,
fluffy, white head on the beer.

01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:06.390
Also, just quickly,
head is part of beer.

01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:08.600
So if you ever put
your finger in here,

01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:11.810
or you blow it off or knock
it off or something like that,

01:08:11.810 --> 01:08:12.890
stop doing that.

01:08:12.890 --> 01:08:14.119
It's part of the beer.

01:08:14.119 --> 01:08:14.660
You drink it.

01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:16.069
OK?

01:08:16.069 --> 01:08:19.800
So we see how long this
sticks around on there.

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:21.060
That is our head retention.

01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:24.890
So we say it's a fluffy,
bright, white head that

01:08:24.890 --> 01:08:27.350
dissipated about
half way quickly,

01:08:27.350 --> 01:08:29.330
and the rest of it stuck around.

01:08:29.330 --> 01:08:31.880
Great, perfect.

01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:35.120
Next will be the
clarity of the beer.

01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:39.050
This beer, for example, has
a slight haze to it, right,

01:08:39.050 --> 01:08:40.680
not so crystal clear.

01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:42.770
It's got a little
haziness, and we just

01:08:42.770 --> 01:08:44.604
want to mention something
along those lines.

01:08:44.604 --> 01:08:45.144
Is it bright?

01:08:45.144 --> 01:08:45.649
Is it crisp?

01:08:45.649 --> 01:08:46.520
Is it clear?

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:48.290
Is it opaque in color?

01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:51.020
Is it hazy, but light in color?

01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:51.930
All of those things.

01:08:51.930 --> 01:08:52.430
OK?

01:08:52.430 --> 01:08:53.630
The next part is the aroma.

01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:56.779
This is where I want you to
spend the majority of your time

01:08:56.779 --> 01:08:58.380
evaluating the aroma.

01:08:58.380 --> 01:09:01.609
So there's a couple of different
parts of our olfactory system.

01:09:01.609 --> 01:09:03.560
There is-- what do you think of?

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:06.219
What part of your body think
of when you think of aroma?

01:09:06.219 --> 01:09:06.979
AUDIENCE: Nose.

01:09:06.979 --> 01:09:08.729
DAVE ADAMS: You think
of your nose, right?

01:09:08.729 --> 01:09:10.550
Pretty obvious, but
the fact of the matter

01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:13.850
is that you have an
orthonasal and a retronasal.

01:09:13.850 --> 01:09:15.920
Your orthonasal is
your nose, and that's

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:19.100
where you get some aroma
from, and your retronasal

01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:20.750
is in the back of
your throat, that's

01:09:20.750 --> 01:09:23.990
connected to your nose, or
your nasal cavity, really.

01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:26.720
And that's where you get
a bunch of aroma from too.

01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:29.359
So a lot of times, what
we think of as humans--

01:09:29.359 --> 01:09:31.819
and some people may have been
taught this in school too--

01:09:31.819 --> 01:09:34.279
that when you smell something,
you smell with your nose.

01:09:34.279 --> 01:09:37.729
And when you put something in
your mouth, it becomes a taste.

01:09:37.729 --> 01:09:38.300
Right?

01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:40.460
Well, that's not the way
that it works at all.

01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:43.189
You're evaluating the
taste and the aroma

01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:45.890
at the same time when you
have something in your mouth.

01:09:45.890 --> 01:09:46.970
You just don't know it.

01:09:46.970 --> 01:09:50.000
And the easiest way to
describe this to you

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.790
would be, anytime that
you've ever been sick before

01:09:52.790 --> 01:09:55.880
and had a stuffed up nose,
and have you ever said, man, I

01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:57.540
can't taste anything.

01:09:57.540 --> 01:09:58.220
Right?

01:09:58.220 --> 01:09:59.570
We've all said that.

01:09:59.570 --> 01:10:01.100
Everyone shake
their head, dammit.

01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:02.970
We've all said that
before in our lives.

01:10:02.970 --> 01:10:04.490
Right?

01:10:04.490 --> 01:10:08.612
That's because our retronasal
is closed at that time.

01:10:08.612 --> 01:10:10.195
So we're not getting
a bunch of aroma.

01:10:10.195 --> 01:10:11.695
It's not that we
can't taste things.

01:10:11.695 --> 01:10:13.230
Our taste buds still work fine.

01:10:13.230 --> 01:10:15.500
It's just that we can only
taste five or six things,

01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:18.950
and we can smell thousands
and thousands and thousands

01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:19.460
of things.

01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:20.000
Right?

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.820
So from a percentage
standpoint, can someone

01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:28.010
figure out what's the
percentage of 5 versus 10,000?

01:10:28.010 --> 01:10:29.780
Whatever that is is
the amount of time

01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:32.630
that you should spend
on aroma versus taste.

01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:35.300
All right, and I'll look
for that answer later.

01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:36.800
Thank you.

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:39.020
We want to take a
short, concise breaths

01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:40.920
as we're doing this evaluation.

01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:43.700
So if anybody's ever taught
you to smell something before--

01:10:43.700 --> 01:10:47.670
for the wine glass, how do they
teach you how to smell wine?

01:10:47.670 --> 01:10:49.506
Come on, guys, you
took a wine class.

01:10:49.506 --> 01:10:51.810
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:53.390
DAVE ADAMS: OK, you've
been out with a friend

01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:54.900
before that's done this before.

01:10:54.900 --> 01:10:57.065
How do people smell wine?

01:10:57.065 --> 01:10:57.579
Go ahead.

01:10:57.579 --> 01:10:59.870
AUDIENCE: You smell the glass,
and you swirl it around.

01:10:59.870 --> 01:11:02.440
DAVE ADAMS: Yeah, what kind of
breath do they take, usually?

01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:03.065
AUDIENCE: Deep.

01:11:03.065 --> 01:11:06.575
DAVE ADAMS: Yeah, a big,
giant, deep one, right?

01:11:06.575 --> 01:11:08.030
Yeah.

01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:10.424
Doesn't that look bad ass?

01:11:10.424 --> 01:11:11.230
No.

01:11:11.230 --> 01:11:12.350
You look stupid.

01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:14.450
So the reason why
we don't do that

01:11:14.450 --> 01:11:16.910
is the same reason
why dogs don't

01:11:16.910 --> 01:11:19.220
take big giant breaths
in, and they take

01:11:19.220 --> 01:11:20.890
little tiny short breaths in.

01:11:20.890 --> 01:11:23.510
It's because it dries
out your nasal cavity,

01:11:23.510 --> 01:11:26.010
so it's no good for
evaluating things.

01:11:26.010 --> 01:11:27.970
So when we take
breaths of things

01:11:27.970 --> 01:11:31.250
in to evaluate the
orthonasal portion of it,

01:11:31.250 --> 01:11:34.760
we want to take small, short
breaths, just like a dog would.

01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:37.970
So I like to smell it, pull it
away, smell it, pull it away,

01:11:37.970 --> 01:11:40.760
smell it, pull it away, and
keep going till I get everything

01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:41.750
that I can out of it.

01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:47.084
Swirling will help agitate
and volatilized the aromas

01:11:47.084 --> 01:11:48.000
that are in the glass.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.400
So if you're having
trouble, because we're

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:51.850
using these little glasses
as we're going to taste.

01:11:51.850 --> 01:11:53.810
So at home if you're
doing this, you

01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:57.750
want to use the biggest
most open, big wine glass,

01:11:57.750 --> 01:11:58.940
stem glass.

01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:01.280
I should mention that while
we're talking about aroma.

01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:03.620
The glass for beer that
you've all seen out there,

01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:05.660
for some reason we got
the shitty glass out

01:12:05.660 --> 01:12:09.140
of all the different types
of liquor in the world.

01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:11.700
The beer glass is the
worst glass in the world.

01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:14.690
So just throw all your beer
glasses in the trash can

01:12:14.690 --> 01:12:16.010
and go buy wine glasses.

01:12:16.010 --> 01:12:19.550
They're are way better for
evaluating beer and just really

01:12:19.550 --> 01:12:20.800
drinking out of in general.

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:21.685
They're just better.

01:12:21.685 --> 01:12:23.810
So if you need to have
water glasses at your house,

01:12:23.810 --> 01:12:26.519
keep those pint glasses in your
cupboard, and you can do that.

01:12:26.519 --> 01:12:28.810
And all the rest of them you
can throw off your balcony

01:12:28.810 --> 01:12:29.710
and call it a day.

01:12:29.710 --> 01:12:32.500
And then go buy wine glasses,
and pour all the stuff

01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:33.460
inside of those.

01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:34.180
OK?

01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:37.000
And then you swirl that
around and smell those, that's

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.244
really what you want to do.

01:12:38.244 --> 01:12:39.860
OK?

01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:43.500
Next, talk about that,
10,000 different aromas.

01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:45.700
Look, exclamation mark.

01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:46.840
Take your time.

01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:48.460
So please, this
is the time that I

01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:51.090
need you to focus on the
most, the most important.

01:12:51.090 --> 01:12:54.274
You should have lots of words
written for this portion if it.

01:12:54.274 --> 01:12:55.690
The other ones
will be very short.

01:12:55.690 --> 01:12:58.210
When you talk about the
appearance of the beer,

01:12:58.210 --> 01:13:00.760
when you're talking about the
taste and aftertaste and all

01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:02.860
those things, but
the aroma, this

01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:06.330
is where your creative writing
really comes into play.

01:13:06.330 --> 01:13:08.680
Think of the food, environment,
memories was something

01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:10.360
that we didn't talk about.

01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:14.500
If you like let's say you had an
orange tree in your front yard

01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:17.800
when you were a kid, and this
reminds you of being at home.

01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:20.110
For me, I had a pepper
tree in my front yard.

01:13:20.110 --> 01:13:23.860
So anytime I have things with
peppercorns, peppercorn sauces,

01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:26.290
you know peppercorn sauce
on a steak, salad, whatever

01:13:26.290 --> 01:13:27.900
it may be, beers that have it.

01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:30.640
It reminds me of being at home,
because I had a big pepper

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:31.660
tree in my front yard.

01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:35.280
So you can associate
those kind of memories.

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:37.557
You know maybe you walked
by a rosebush every day

01:13:37.557 --> 01:13:39.640
from your grandma's house
when you went to school.

01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:42.010
So the beer reminds you of
being at grandma's house

01:13:42.010 --> 01:13:42.850
and going to school.

01:13:42.850 --> 01:13:44.930
That's cool.

01:13:44.930 --> 01:13:46.770
All right, taste
is the next part.

01:13:46.770 --> 01:13:49.130
So this is where people
get very confused.

01:13:49.130 --> 01:13:52.070
Taste is the portion
of your tongue

01:13:52.070 --> 01:13:54.800
and all the receptors around
your cheeks and whatnot,

01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:59.630
and you can only detect a
very small amount of qualities

01:13:59.630 --> 01:14:00.440
from taste.

01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:06.320
Here they are-- sweet,
sour, salty, bitter, umami,

01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:09.480
and then if it's none
of these, it's an aroma.

01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:12.500
So a lot of times, matter
of fact, every single time

01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:16.460
I've done this class, which
is probably 150 times,

01:14:16.460 --> 01:14:19.370
there's always been one
person, at the very least,

01:14:19.370 --> 01:14:22.760
who's written an aroma
in the taste section.

01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:24.350
Don't be that person.

01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:28.190
You can be my first class
who doesn't do that.

01:14:28.190 --> 01:14:30.290
I'll be so happy.

01:14:30.290 --> 01:14:31.970
And it's very hard
to do, because like I

01:14:31.970 --> 01:14:35.190
said, we're all taught to, when
we take a sip of something,

01:14:35.190 --> 01:14:37.230
it becomes the
taste immediately.

01:14:37.230 --> 01:14:40.310
So you think, as soon as you
put the beer into your mouth,

01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:42.890
everything that you can think
of in your brain at that point

01:14:42.890 --> 01:14:43.790
becomes taste.

01:14:43.790 --> 01:14:46.250
This is just not true,
because if it is not

01:14:46.250 --> 01:14:49.160
one of those things,
it's not a taste.

01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:50.420
That's it, period.

01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:53.150
So does that mean that
you only describe it

01:14:53.150 --> 01:14:55.620
as sweet, sour,
salty, umami, bitter?

01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:56.810
No, it doesn't.

01:14:56.810 --> 01:15:00.020
It means be creative,
have fun, you still

01:15:00.020 --> 01:15:02.300
want some creative
input on this.

01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:05.150
And what I like to do
is use one qualitative

01:15:05.150 --> 01:15:08.840
and one quantitative
descriptor in front of a taste.

01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:11.680
So what I mean by
that is you give

01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:17.240
a level of whatever
the quality is,

01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:19.260
like let's say it's
bitter for example.

01:15:19.260 --> 01:15:23.540
So I would say a qualitative
example like pine

01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:28.380
and a quantitative example like
high, aggressive, moderate,

01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:33.470
low, medium, and then say
the taste descriptor, bitter.

01:15:33.470 --> 01:15:37.460
So it has a piney,
aggressive bitterness.

01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:43.070
It has a moderate, caramel
sweetness, something like that.

01:15:43.070 --> 01:15:44.350
Make sense?

01:15:44.350 --> 01:15:46.250
OK.

01:15:46.250 --> 01:15:48.890
Next, after taste
and mouth feel.

01:15:48.890 --> 01:15:52.160
So here, we're going
to be judging whatever

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:54.210
we are detecting in our mouths.

01:15:54.210 --> 01:15:57.770
So the viscosity of the
beer, how thick is the beer,

01:15:57.770 --> 01:16:01.030
is it like a brandy?

01:16:01.030 --> 01:16:03.830
Is it coating your
mouth, or is it

01:16:03.830 --> 01:16:06.380
like a champagne that
wafts away very quickly

01:16:06.380 --> 01:16:08.615
and is very
effervescent and bubbly.

01:16:08.615 --> 01:16:10.422
The effervescence
is a big part of it.

01:16:10.422 --> 01:16:11.630
We talked about that earlier.

01:16:11.630 --> 01:16:14.510
If it's a highly
effervescent beer,

01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:19.340
it will seem much more
lighter on your palate.

01:16:19.340 --> 01:16:22.610
Lingering flavors, any
bitterness, any sweetness,

01:16:22.610 --> 01:16:25.330
any roastiness that
lingers around,

01:16:25.330 --> 01:16:28.430
mention it here in the
aftertaste and the mouthfeel,

01:16:28.430 --> 01:16:29.290
and that's it.

01:16:29.290 --> 01:16:30.470
Cheers.

01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:34.070
OK, any more questions
before we start tasting?

01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:34.952
Yes.

01:16:34.952 --> 01:16:36.800
AUDIENCE: Why is beer
so warm in Germany?

01:16:37.629 --> 01:16:38.545
DAVE ADAMS: I'm sorry?

01:16:38.545 --> 01:16:42.185
AUDIENCE: In Germany,
beers are so warm.

01:16:42.185 --> 01:16:43.100
DAVE ADAMS: Long?

01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:44.080
AUDIENCE: Warm.

01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:46.010
DAVE ADAMS: Warm,
I'm sorry, thank you.

01:16:46.010 --> 01:16:48.770
The question was why are the
beers so warm in Germany?

01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:51.660
So first of all, the beer
should not be warm in Germany.

01:16:51.660 --> 01:16:55.110
So you probably didn't have
very good beer over there.

01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:58.520
The beer in Europe
sometimes can be

01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:01.430
served at cellar
temperature, which

01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:04.110
is 50 to 55 degrees Fahrenheit.

01:17:04.110 --> 01:17:06.230
So it depends on
how you drink beer.

01:17:06.230 --> 01:17:11.210
But sometimes we are sort of
maybe programmed, if you will,

01:17:11.210 --> 01:17:15.800
to drink beer at a
very cold temperature,

01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:20.360
maybe because of some one
brewery who makes commercials

01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:23.150
about trains and ice mountains.

01:17:23.150 --> 01:17:27.320
But other than that, you
should not be drinking beer

01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:29.900
at super cold temperatures.

01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:32.450
And the reason why is
because all those aromas,

01:17:32.450 --> 01:17:37.330
they do not come out into
the air at cold temperatures,

01:17:37.330 --> 01:17:39.290
or into your mouth,
for that matter,

01:17:39.290 --> 01:17:40.520
or into your nasal cavity.

01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:44.660
So when you drink beer, it
should be at that 50 to 55

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:46.859
degree range, especially
if you're evaluating it.

01:17:46.859 --> 01:17:49.400
I mean, there are certain things
to be said about preference.

01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:52.790
Like if you love your beer
super ice cold, then whatever,

01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:53.840
drink it super ice cold.

01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:56.780
But just know that you're
not getting as much flavor

01:17:56.780 --> 01:18:00.180
and aroma out of it as if you
drank it a few degrees warmer.

01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:03.770
So as a rule of thumb,
usually, I like it

01:18:03.770 --> 01:18:05.660
at about 45 degrees or so.

01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:09.200
If I'm really like diving in
and judging beer or something,

01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:13.511
we almost always have
it at 50, 55 degrees.

01:18:13.511 --> 01:18:14.695
There you go.

01:18:14.695 --> 01:18:15.330
What else?

01:18:17.997 --> 01:18:18.830
Ready to drink beer?

01:18:18.830 --> 01:18:19.640
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:20.890
DAVE ADAMS: OK, peace.

01:18:20.890 --> 01:18:23.940
[APPLAUSE]
