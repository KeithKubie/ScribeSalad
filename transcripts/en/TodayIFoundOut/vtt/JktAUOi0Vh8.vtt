00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.260
Prior to the twentieth century, American football
teams tended to call their plays via a quarterback

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:19.520
simply giving signals while the team either
stood in more or less a generic near-set position

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.900
or back from the line a bit as the quarterback
called out what they’d do next. So where

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.590
did the idea of standing well behind the line
of scrimmage in a huddle come from?

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.090
While there are no contemporary news reports
or other definitive primary documents from

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.300
the time period to support the story, it is
generally claimed that quarterback Paul Hubbard

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.330
of Gallaudet University invented the huddle
sometime between 1892 and 1895, though if

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:47.079
so, perhaps after 1892 as Hubbard wasn’t
team captain until 1893.

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.190
For the uninitiated, Gallaudet University
is a school formed to educate deaf and hard

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.930
of hearing individuals. Hubbard, like the
rest of his teammates, relied on American

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.960
Sign Language to communicate game strategies
and specific plays, something easily interpreted

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.989
by opposing teams intent on gaining the upper
hand, especially teams that also consisted

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.420
of deaf and hard of hearing players and coaches.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.750
The two general ways around this problem,
whether signing or verbally shouting out,

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.150
are to code the signals or to simply block
the other team from being able to see them.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.270
Hubbard supposedly chose the latter, instructing
his teammates to form a circle around him

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.050
to discuss the plays.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.500
As to how the huddle spread to other teams
(and even other sports), this isn’t any

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.289
clearer than the commonly touted Hubbard origin
story, at least as far as hard, documented

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:38.130
evidence is concerned. It is often claimed
to have spread via deaf and hard of hearing

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.610
students taking it to other schools after
graduating from Gallaudet University, with

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.880
some of them going on to teach or coach at
said other schools for the deaf.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.870
In fact, it is often stated that Hubbard himself
did this. After leaving Gallaudet in 1896,

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.220
he returned to his hometown of Olathe, Kansas
as a teacher at the Kansas School for the

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.800
Deaf. In 1899, he started the school’s football
program and coached for many years, with it

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.030
claimed he taught his players the huddle.
However, Hubbard himself doesn’t seem to

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.200
have ever said he did this and there is no
contemporary evidence backing up that the

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.000
team at the Kansas School for the Deaf used
the huddle under Hubbard. Of course, if Hubbard

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.060
really did use the huddle previous to this,
presumably he would have brought the practice

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.500
over to his new team.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.840
As for an alternate origin story, it is noted
by Dr. I. H. Baker in the 1945 work Football:

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.160
Facts and Figures that the huddle was used
by the University of Georgia in 1896 in a

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.800
game against Auburn University. Baker’s
claim here is in turn derived from the History

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.660
of Southern Football, written by Fuzzy Woodruff
in 1928. In it, Woodruff gives an account

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.760
of the game in question and describes a huddle
being used. (I wasn’t able to find a copy

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:38.760
of the book nor a transcript of the statement
in question to see if Woodruff was simply

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.760
basing this account off of his own memory
of events some 32 years before or something

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.760
a little more concrete.)

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.440
Unfortunately, contemporary documented evidence
seems to fail us on both Hubbard and Woodruff’s

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.151
claims, though there is no reason to think
either were making anything up here, and we

00:02:46.151 --> 00:02:51.550
do know from a 1942 letter from one of Hubbard’s
former classmates that Hubbard was being credited

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.401
as inventing the huddle by a news report concerning
Hubbard’s retirement. In the letter, one

00:02:56.401 --> 00:02:58.110
Herbert C. Merrill writes to Hubbard,

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.290
The item ascribes the origin of the football
‘huddle’ to you. It must have been during

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.370
the time that the College had that scrub team
that made all the teams around Washington,

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.350
including the Naval Academy, look silly.

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.170
However, it’s not completely clear from
the letter whether Merrill, who was valedictorian

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.230
of his graduating class at Gallaudet in 1896,
himself is corroborating Hubbard’s claim-

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.040
that Merrill remembers Hubbard using the huddle-
or was simply pointing out the news report

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.150
to Hubbard. False memories being extremely
prevalent, as much as we humans don’t like

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.100
to admit it, and a near half a century separating
the letter from the events in question, even

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:38.120
if he was more explicit about it, this wouldn’t
really help us much either way in being more

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.490
definitive. Also very unfortunately, it isn’t
clear what news report Merrill was referencing

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:43.490
to see what they were basing their claim on
to perhaps shed a little more light on the

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:44.490
issue.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.850
So that’s the commonly touted origin story.
But when did the huddle first start being

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.240
recorded in first-hand contemporary reports
that have survived to today?

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.740
This appears to have occurred in a game involving
Oregon State University and Seattle’s University

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.930
of Washington on November 18, 1918. (Incidentally,
it was at the University of Washington that

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.030
the sporting wave first started becoming popular,
though it wasn’t invented there, contrary

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.680
to popular belief, see Who Invented the Wave?)

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.450
During the game in question, Oregon State,
coached by Bill Hargiss, found themselves

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.350
with a little problem on their hands. One
of the Oregon State players in that game,

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.500
Jack Foster, later recalled the issue,

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.090
As I remember, in the first half of that game,
the U. of W. team was reading our signals

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.060
as the quarterback called them, and was stopping
us cold on nearly every play. So during halftime

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.520
Coach Hargiss told us to whisper the play
out of hearing of the defensive team, and

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.840
then our plays began to work. We did not use
it on every play.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.350
Famed Seattle Post-Intelligencer editor Royal
Brougham noted of this then bizarre move in

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.000
the game, “I remember how puzzled the writers
were when the Oregon… team lined up in a

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.600
group five or ten yards behind the line like
they were holding a prayer meeting or something.”

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.500
Hargiss, however, did not claim to have invented
the huddle, simply claiming he was the first

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.760
to use it in a college game as far as he was
aware. As to where he got the idea from, he

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.760
stated,

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.540
I was refereeing a high school game out there
and it was one of those close grudge, battles

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.870
where the crowd cheered loudly and the band
played the same way. The offensive team got

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.440
down to a do-or-die play and the boys couldn’t
hear the quarterback’s signals. So he called

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.260
them into a huddle to give ’em the play.
I thought a lot about that, and I experimented

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.199
with it at Oregon State. Other coaches criticized
it because they said it cost time. But I put

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:28.850
a stop-watch on it, and it often was faster
than the signal calling system.

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.000
With the huddle seemingly being a success
in 1918, Hargiss continued to use it on occasion

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.750
and later brought it to Emporia State University
in Kansas in 1920. Within a year of that,

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.760
famed football coach Bob Zuppke of the University
of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, who is

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.199
sometimes credited as inventing the huddle,
started using it. Notably, columnist Frederick

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:51.800
Meagher in an article published in The Frat
in September of 1946 claimed Zuppke didn’t

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.660
himself say he invented the huddle, nor that
he got it from Hargiss, but that “Zuppke

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.860
admits he took it from an un-named deaf football
team he saw somewhere.”

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.360
Whatever the case, soon after Hargiss and
Zuppke pioneered the huddle in college football,

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:33.400
many teams at every level of the sport began
adopting it.
