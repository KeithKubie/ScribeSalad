00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:04.065
- [Voiceover] A factory has
machines that produce toys,

00:00:04.065 --> 00:00:06.642
which are then packed by
the factory's workers.

00:00:06.642 --> 00:00:09.986
One day, each machine produced 14 toys

00:00:09.986 --> 00:00:12.424
and each worker packed two toys,

00:00:12.424 --> 00:00:16.836
so that a total of 40
toys remained unpacked.

00:00:16.836 --> 00:00:20.736
Additionally, the number of
workers that day was eight less

00:00:20.736 --> 00:00:23.499
than seven times the number of machines.

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:26.402
How many machines and workers were there?

00:00:26.402 --> 00:00:27.586
I encourage you to pause the video.

00:00:27.586 --> 00:00:30.117
This is a good little problem over here.

00:00:30.117 --> 00:00:32.648
All right, so let's define some variables.

00:00:32.648 --> 00:00:34.965
So let's say M is equal

00:00:34.965 --> 00:00:38.536
to the number of machines,

00:00:39.586 --> 00:00:43.451
and let's say that W is equal

00:00:43.451 --> 00:00:47.723
to the number of workers.

00:00:47.723 --> 00:00:49.441
Those seem like reasonable variables.

00:00:49.441 --> 00:00:51.614
So what does the first sentence tell us?

00:00:51.614 --> 00:00:56.593
It tells us one day each
machine produced 14 toys.

00:00:56.593 --> 00:00:59.240
So if each machine produced 14 toys,

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.842
what is the total number of toys

00:01:00.842 --> 00:01:02.630
that are going to be produced?

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:03.907
Well, the total number
of toys that are going

00:01:03.907 --> 00:01:07.808
to be produced is going to
be the number per machine

00:01:07.808 --> 00:01:10.292
times the number of machines.

00:01:10.292 --> 00:01:15.121
So this is 14M toys produced.

00:01:15.121 --> 00:01:19.946
So this is what is produced.
Produced, right over there.

00:01:19.946 --> 00:01:22.743
And then how many toys
are going to be packed?

00:01:22.743 --> 00:01:25.437
Well, if each worker packed two toys,

00:01:25.437 --> 00:01:28.780
they tell us there, each
worker packed two toys,

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.684
so the total number that's
going to be packed is going

00:01:30.684 --> 00:01:34.551
to be two toys per worker
times the number of workers.

00:01:34.551 --> 00:01:37.598
So that right over there, that's
the number of toys packed.

00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:42.143
And then they tell us the
number of toys that remain,

00:01:42.143 --> 00:01:45.510
the total that remains unpacked.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.201
So the total that remains
unpacked, we know that that is 40.

00:01:49.201 --> 00:01:52.290
Let me do that in a neutral color.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.751
So 40, for 40,

00:01:55.751 --> 00:01:59.148
so that we could view the 40
as produced, but not packed.

00:01:59.148 --> 00:02:04.094
Produced, not packed.

00:02:04.094 --> 00:02:07.599
That's the number, the
total the remain unpacked.

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:10.642
Well, how do we relate produced and packed

00:02:10.642 --> 00:02:12.452
to the produced that are not packed?

00:02:12.452 --> 00:02:14.147
Well, if we take the
total that were produced,

00:02:14.147 --> 00:02:16.609
we subtract out the
number that were packed,

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:19.418
we're gonna be left with
the total that are unpacked.

00:02:19.418 --> 00:02:20.254
So just like that,

00:02:20.254 --> 00:02:25.246
we're able to set up a linear
relationship between M and W.

00:02:25.246 --> 00:02:27.939
Well, just one isn't enough
to solve for M and W,

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:29.518
but we have another relationship.

00:02:29.518 --> 00:02:32.839
They say, additionally, the
number of workers that day,

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:35.346
so the number of workers that day.

00:02:35.346 --> 00:02:38.110
I could say W. I'll write it over here.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.222
W, the number of workers that day,

00:02:40.222 --> 00:02:43.543
was eight less than seven
times the number of machines.

00:02:43.543 --> 00:02:47.281
Or you could say it was equal
to seven times the number

00:02:47.281 --> 00:02:49.788
of machines minus eight.

00:02:49.788 --> 00:02:52.250
That would be eight less
than seven times the number

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.620
of machines.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.127
7M minus eight.

00:02:56.127 --> 00:02:59.286
And now we have two
equations with two unknowns.

00:02:59.286 --> 00:03:00.958
If things work out well, we might be able

00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:04.811
to actually solve for W and M.

00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:06.600
So there is a bunch of ways to do it.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.452
Since this equation already
has W explicitly solved for,

00:03:11.452 --> 00:03:13.287
we can do some substitution here.

00:03:13.287 --> 00:03:17.211
We can take this W and
substitute it in for this W.

00:03:17.211 --> 00:03:21.292
Or, actually I should say,
we could take 7M minus eight

00:03:21.292 --> 00:03:23.712
and substitute it in for this W,

00:03:23.712 --> 00:03:26.754
since the M and W, the
pair that we wanna find,

00:03:26.754 --> 00:03:28.635
need to satisfy both equations.

00:03:28.635 --> 00:03:30.770
And so we are going to get,

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.046
we're going to get 14M minus,

00:03:35.046 --> 00:03:37.988
minus two,

00:03:37.988 --> 00:03:41.643
minus two times, let me do that in a,

00:03:41.643 --> 00:03:46.009
so minus two times, and instead of a W,

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:48.280
I can write the 7M minus eight.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.085
So 7M minus eight,

00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:55.837
and we get that equals 40,

00:03:55.837 --> 00:03:58.392
is equal to 40, so we get,

00:03:58.392 --> 00:04:00.133
now it's just a little bit of algebra.

00:04:00.133 --> 00:04:02.339
14M and then, let's see,

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:04.288
I'll do everything in a neutral color now.

00:04:04.288 --> 00:04:06.945
So negative two times 7M

00:04:06.945 --> 00:04:10.035
is negative 14M,

00:04:10.035 --> 00:04:13.344
and then negative two times negative eight

00:04:13.344 --> 00:04:16.134
is plus 16,

00:04:16.134 --> 00:04:18.987
and then that's going to be equal to 40.

00:04:18.987 --> 00:04:22.515
Now, 14M minus 14M, that's
just going to be zero,

00:04:22.515 --> 00:04:26.219
and we're left that 16 is equal to 40.

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:28.251
Well, that's never going to be true.

00:04:28.251 --> 00:04:32.267
16 is never going to be equal to 40.

00:04:32.267 --> 00:04:35.380
Doesn't matter what M and W are.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.446
In fact, M and W have been
eliminated from this equation.

00:04:37.446 --> 00:04:39.466
This is impossible.

00:04:39.466 --> 00:04:42.484
This right over here is impossible,

00:04:42.484 --> 00:04:44.341
for 16 to be equal to 40,

00:04:44.341 --> 00:04:46.617
and because of that, there
are no solutions to this.

00:04:46.617 --> 00:04:50.240
There's no M and W pair

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.747
that matches the constraints they gave us,

00:04:52.747 --> 00:04:56.277
so there is no solution.

00:04:56.277 --> 00:04:58.622
No solution.

00:04:58.622 --> 00:05:01.037
I'll put that in a little square there.
