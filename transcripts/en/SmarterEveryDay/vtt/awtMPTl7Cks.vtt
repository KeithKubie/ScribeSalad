00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.030
[SED Slide Guitar Intro Music]

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:09.580
[Oropendola bird calling]

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.120
(Destin) Are you about to grab that?
- They're quick.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.140
So you gotta kind of predict the movement.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.170
[laughs] Oh man, don't let it go in the hole.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.220
(Destin) Holy Cow! Golly!

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.250
(Destin) What is this called?
-(Phil) A Tailless Whip Scorpion.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.260
- A tailless whip scorpion. Let me grab it with my hand. [sarcastic]

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.270
-(talking to demon bug) Don't go in there!
 It's actually kind of a dead end.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.280
- (Entire group in amazement, laughing) Oh yes.
(Destin) Oh my gosh. He's got a..

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.300
WOW it's in his hand.
- Look at that

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.360
(Jeff) it's fighting him.
(Destin) It's biting?
(Jeff) FIGHT-ing 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.380
(Destin) What the? What is going on?
(Jeff) Describe what you're feeling.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.430
- It's just a little.. it's like a pointy stick.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.450
[gaspy laugh]
(Destin) Holy cow!

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.460
(Destin) Oh my gosh!
- [Phil laughing] Is that a monster or what?

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.480
So these really really long legs..

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.540
That's basically its eyes. So that's what it sees with.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.560
-What?
- These are feelers.
- Yeah. These feelers, but they're legs.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.630
- It's really sensitive to vibrations so if you watch them hunt, they basically put those all around

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.650
the thing they're about to catch, and they know exactly where it is and then boom.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.680
(Gordon) Are these arachnids or not?
- Ahh yes. It is

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.730
and arachnid.
(Destin) What?

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.780
What are we looking at?
- Is that crazy or what?

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.790
- So they have just, really really tiny eyes
(Destin) What are these things on the inside of its elbows?

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.840
(British guy off camera) Those white things.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.870
- I think that's just where the muscle is,

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.900
inside it.
- Kind of like on a crab? A dust cover?
- Yeah.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.930
So you can see that it would just trap something

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.960
right inside there, and that's how we would 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.000
eat.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.020
And you can see tiny little fangs but they don't have any venom or anything.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.040
So, they're quite all right.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.080
Am I gonna be the first one to put it on my face and..
(Destin) Oh my gosh!

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.100
Are you serious?!
- Go for it.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.170
(Destin) Oh! Is this happening? Oh my gosh!

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.190
(Bewildered group) My God dude, that is crazy!

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.210
(Destin) What.. What is happening?!
- Alright. Who's gonna

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.260
catch him and put him on their face? 
(Gordon) I really don't want to do this
(Phil) Do it. You got this.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.300
(Destin) Oh. Is this some kind of rite of passage?!

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.340
- Oh look at that! Like a champ!

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.370
[laugh]

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.410
- Do it do it. Put it on his face.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.440
(Destin) Alright. Hold on. Wawawawait! Keep it away from my eyes.
- What's happening Destin? What's happening.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.490
(Jeff) Talk to me. What are you doing?

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.520
Derp! D'oooohhhh...Serious?!

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.550
G'ohhhh! Oh gohh!

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.590
Serious!  Guh... Guh..
- [laugh] That's even worse.
- Yeah, that's even worse.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.600
(Destin clearly losing mind) Think.. oh what?! WHAT. IS. HAPPENING?!
[laugh]

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.640
- Alright.
(Destin) OK.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.670
- Get that hand away from your face. This time it's real. Time to man up.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.710
You're in the Amazon alright.
- Man up!
- It's not Alabama.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.730
(Destin) [squeaks] [laugh] Doh! (mumbling) ARE YOU SERIOUS!?

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.780
- Talk to me. Give an introduction right now.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.810
Hey it's me Destin welcome to Smarter Every Day. I'm in the Amazon rainforest!

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.810
[squeal] JRUUUH-UH!  TJRUAA!
(Group) [Clapping, pointing, generally ridiculing Destin for his pansy ways.]Yess! [laughs]

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.830
(Destin) There it is.

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.850
[laughs]
- That was perfect.
- That was the best intro

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.860
that's ever happened.
- The best, the bomb.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:05.190
[music]

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.930
It's a scorpion

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.000
without a tail. Oh man he stinks. That is the ugliest

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.050
beast I have ever seen. So there you go.. The Tailless Whip Scorpion.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.100
So we're gonna put him back. We're gonna be good people

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.110
and NOT kill it with fire, like we should. [laugh]

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.140
