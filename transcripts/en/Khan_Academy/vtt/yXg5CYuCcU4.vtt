00:00:00.621 --> 00:00:03.048
I want to do a quick correction to the AIME problem

00:00:03.048 --> 00:00:06.432
where we cut out a wedge of a log in that problem.

00:00:06.432 --> 00:00:07.825
So we had a wedge

00:00:07.825 --> 00:00:10.887
so just to remind ourselves that we had a log

00:00:10.887 --> 00:00:13.145
and it looked like that

00:00:13.145 --> 00:00:14.916
we made one cut that was right along

00:00:14.916 --> 00:00:17.139
that was perpendicular to the axis of the log

00:00:17.139 --> 00:00:18.039
and we made another cut

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.421
that had a 45 degree angle.

00:00:20.421 --> 00:00:22.082
So it was like that.

00:00:22.082 --> 00:00:23.549
And the solution to the problem

00:00:23.549 --> 00:00:25.104
we had to figure out the volume of the wedge

00:00:25.104 --> 00:00:26.564
and the big trick there was

00:00:26.564 --> 00:00:28.723
if I drew the wedge like this

00:00:28.723 --> 00:00:30.395
so let me take a side view of the wedge.

00:00:30.395 --> 00:00:34.148
So this is the side of the wedge right over here.

00:00:34.148 --> 00:00:37.314
I could shade it to show that it's kind of round.

00:00:37.314 --> 00:00:38.401
So if I were to shade it

00:00:38.401 --> 00:00:39.824
you could kind of see that it is round.

00:00:39.824 --> 00:00:41.687
So this is a side view of the wedge.

00:00:41.687 --> 00:00:44.517
We knew that this right here is a 45 degree angle.

00:00:44.517 --> 00:00:45.813
And the way that we solved the problem

00:00:45.813 --> 00:00:47.420
or the kind of trick was to say

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.892
Hey, if we had another wedge like this

00:00:48.892 --> 00:00:50.644
and we just stacked it on top of this one

00:00:50.644 --> 00:00:53.714
if we just flipped it over and made it like this

00:00:53.714 --> 00:00:57.655
then we also have a 45 degree angle over here

00:00:57.655 --> 00:00:58.719
and it would make a cylinder

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:00.694
and it's very easy

00:01:00.694 --> 00:01:02.549
to figure out the height of a cylinder.

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:04.219
And I misspoke when I said it was lucky

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:06.060
that we had a 45 degree angle.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.274
Because in the last video

00:01:07.274 --> 00:01:09.335
I was actually visualizing it incorrectly.

00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:10.147
Because I said if you had anything

00:01:10.147 --> 00:01:11.926
less than a 45 degree angle

00:01:11.926 --> 00:01:13.553
this wouldn't have worked out properly

00:01:13.553 --> 00:01:14.406
But I was wrong!

00:01:14.406 --> 00:01:16.136
It would have worked out properly.

00:01:16.138 --> 00:01:17.485
Let me show you.

00:01:17.485 --> 00:01:22.640
So this, let's just say whatever angle you have here.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.590
So this is going to be 90 degrees over here.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.005
Whatever angle you have over here

00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:27.980
so let's call that theta

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.198
this over here, they have to add up to 180.

00:01:30.198 --> 00:01:33.364
So theta plus 90 plus this has to be 180

00:01:33.364 --> 00:01:36.569
Or theta plus this has to be 90

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:40.315
or you could just call this 90 minus theta.

00:01:40.315 --> 00:01:43.600
Now, if I were to take the same thing

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.267
if I took another kind of wedge like this

00:01:46.267 --> 00:01:48.252
and flipped it over this thing

00:01:48.252 --> 00:01:50.048
it's not this angle that's going to be right here

00:01:50.048 --> 00:01:51.093
it's this angle.

00:01:51.093 --> 00:01:52.539
Let me just draw it over here.

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:57.723
It would look like this.

00:01:57.723 --> 00:01:59.194
Where this now is theta.

00:01:59.194 --> 00:02:00.324
This end right here

00:02:00.324 --> 00:02:03.038
is actually that end on the flipped version.

00:02:03.038 --> 00:02:04.757
And now this angle right over here

00:02:04.757 --> 00:02:06.942
is now 90 minus theta.

00:02:06.942 --> 00:02:09.674
So clearly you have 90 minus theta plus theta.

00:02:09.674 --> 00:02:11.902
So this thing is going to be a right angle

00:02:11.902 --> 00:02:13.934
no matter what.

00:02:13.934 --> 00:02:15.826
Obviously it has to be a reasonable angle

00:02:15.826 --> 00:02:16.526
but no matter

00:02:16.526 --> 00:02:18.203
assuming that its less than 90 degrees

00:02:18.203 --> 00:02:19.260
it would have worked out.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.523
You could have done the same trick.

00:02:20.523 --> 00:02:21.821
Anyway, hopefully that clarifies it

00:02:21.821 --> 00:02:22.495
and I apologize

00:02:22.495 --> 00:02:26.329
for the incorrect visualization in the last video.
