JUDITH D. SINGER: Thank
you all for coming out

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.600
to today's new
Faculty Institute.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.200
I'm just going to make
a few opening remarks

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.040
and then introduce provost
Alan Garber, who will also

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.379
make some opening remarks.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.870
And then I'll come back on.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.610
One request I have is don't
sit next to somebody you know.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.350
The whole purpose of this is
to meet people you don't know.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.084
And we are trying to encourage
those kinds of opportunities.

00:00:30.084 --> 00:00:32.000
And there will be a
break, and there will also

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.390
be a reception afterwards
where there will

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.870
be more opportunity for that.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.720
Just want to say a few words
of introduction about why we do

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.000
this new Faculty Institute.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.287
I am the Senior Vice Provost
for Faculty Development

00:00:46.287 --> 00:00:46.870
and Diversity.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.770
I started in this role in 2008.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.220
And one of the
commitments that I

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.120
had when I started was to try
to make faculty at Harvard

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.270
feel not just part of their
department or their school,

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.900
but part of Harvard University.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.020
Harvard is a fabulous place
with lots of interesting people

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.960
and lots of rich opportunities.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.430
But historically, the university
had too few opportunities

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.597
to do these kinds of things.

00:01:12.597 --> 00:01:14.805
In fact, I was just talking
with one of our panelists

00:01:14.805 --> 00:01:15.570
about this.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.570
And when I was hired in
1984-- so it's 30 years ago--

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.600
I was given keys
to an office and I

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.880
was told to go to
an HR orientation

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.700
to learn about my
health benefits,

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.255
and then I started teaching.

00:01:30.255 --> 00:01:32.107
So Harvard in those
days did nothing.

00:01:32.107 --> 00:01:34.190
Harvard in those days did
not have a tenure track.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.000
It did not have a commitment
to its assistant and associate

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.910
professors.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.060
The Harvard of today is really
quite different in terms

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.100
of what we are trying to
accomplish as a university,

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.360
and why you were all selected
by your colleagues who

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.880
put in an enormous
amount of work

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.430
to identify you
as people to come

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.370
into our vibrant community.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.840
What you'll learn, if
you haven't already,

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.000
is that Harvard's a great
place to be a faculty

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.200
member for a variety of
reasons, some obvious,

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.520
some not so obvious.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.630
The obvious ones are
fabulous colleagues.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.447
I mean, when you
came and interviewed,

00:02:10.447 --> 00:02:12.030
when you had
conversations, you really

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.740
got a sense, hopefully,
of the excitement.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.220
There is a little bit of
Harvard exceptionalism

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.040
that we sometimes take too
much advantage of and sometimes

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.730
can make light of.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.770
But one of the things today is
to meet colleagues who are not

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.405
in your immediate sphere.

00:02:27.405 --> 00:02:28.780
So either people
from other parts

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.740
of the university who do
work similar to you or people

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.500
in your part of the
university who do

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.850
work dissimilar from you.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.065
And I hope you take
the chance to do that.

00:02:37.065 --> 00:02:38.690
How many of you are
teaching right now?

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.010
Yeah.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.020
So once you start
teaching, you just

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.650
get a sense of how
vibrant the students are,

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.890
how exciting they are,
how challenging they are,

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.144
how they make you think.

00:02:48.144 --> 00:02:49.560
They make you think
you don't know

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.126
things you thought you know.

00:02:51.126 --> 00:02:52.962
They make you go home
and work on things

00:02:52.962 --> 00:02:55.420
that you didn't know you were
going to work on because they

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.890
asked you a question
you actually

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.500
don't know the answer
to and you're terrified.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.699
You'll also have
fabulous opportunities.

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:04.490
This is part of the
Harvard exceptionalism.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.300
Being here opens doors.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.610
Being at Harvard, people like
to have people on panels.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.660
People like to solicit people.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.080
And it's also just a great place
to do research and scholarship

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.660
and engage, whether it's
with our library collections,

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.240
with our art collections, with
our scientific facilities.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.330
Whatever it is that
you're interested in,

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.600
Harvard has a wealth
of resources in this.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.430
So I'm going to stop right
now because Alan's time is

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.270
rather tight, and introduce
Alan Garber who is our provost.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.050
He is now no longer a newbie.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.575
He has been here--
this is your--

00:03:36.575 --> 00:03:37.700
ALAN M. GARBER: Fifth year.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:38.520
JUDITH D. SINGER:
--fifth year, wow.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.020
OK.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.470
It's Alan's fifth year.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.810
Alan bleeds crimson.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.820
He went here as
an undergraduate,

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.280
did some training here.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.360
He is an MD/PhD,
PhD in economics,

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.190
and brings his skills both as an
MD and able to work with people

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.700
and as a PhD in
economics in terms

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.300
of analyzing higher education
and the finances of higher

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.480
education and how things run.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.930
And we've invited Alan here
to just make a few welcoming

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.990
remarks, and also
if we have some time

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.370
to take some questions
from folks in the audience.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.926
So let me introduce Alan Garber.

00:04:13.926 --> 00:04:17.201
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.330
ALAN M. GARBER: Thank you, Judy.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.890
First of all, I just
want to add my welcome.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.420
We're delighted that
you're all here.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.060
I'm not talking about for
this afternoon's event,

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.580
although we are
happy about that,

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.760
but that you're here at Harvard.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.490
And for us, success
means that your career

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:44.280
grows beyond your wildest dreams
as a result of your coming

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.630
to Harvard to be faculty.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:52.180
Whether you are a junior faculty
member or a newly recruited

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.200
tenured professor,
Harvard is a place

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.330
where we want you to achieve
your professional aspirations.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.760
I don't have a lot
of advice for you.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.350
Sometimes I'm asked for advice.

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.860
And I have four
children, I should add,

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.690
and I know how rare it is
to be able to give somebody

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.530
advice where they ask for it and
they'll actually listen to you.

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.120
As provost, people
will always at least

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.650
go through the motions
of sounding grateful.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.120
But I have some
advice that I think

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.510
is really worth
following, and this is

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.050
the advice I want to give you.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.180
When you think about
what Harvard offers,

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.460
Judy touched on a lot of
what makes Harvard great.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.490
We have the largest
university endowment.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.580
Although if you look at a per
student or per faculty basis,

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:45.155
we do not.

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.210
We have the most distinguished
faculty in the world,

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.734
arguably, although we do
have plenty of competition.

00:05:54.734 --> 00:05:56.150
Tomorrow's New
York Times is going

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.272
to have a story that
rankles a little bit having

00:05:59.272 --> 00:06:00.147
to do with economics.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.270
But we certainly do have
a distinguished faculty.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.940
We have the world's
largest library.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.700
Largest research
library, I should say.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.940
And it's the fourth
largest library

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.680
in the world by many measures.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.950
We have our art museum.

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:21.550
We have many museums on campus.

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.880
Our art museum is
by some measures

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.630
the sixth largest art
museum in the country.

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:35.070
Not among academic institutions,
among all art museums.

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.150
And the list goes on and on.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.410
We have many
treasures that we own.

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.010
We have many things
that make Harvard

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:45.100
look like a spectacular place.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.350
But what I think is the
genuine distinction of Harvard

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:52.430
and why it is so terrific
to be a faculty member here

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:56.900
or a student here is that
our excellence extends

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.340
across so many different areas.

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:04.590
So many areas of academic,
of intellectual pursuit.

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.520
Very few universities are
even competitive with us

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.200
in this regard.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.240
So many of you have
come here to be

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.140
in the top ranked department
in your field, or at least one

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.590
of the top ranked departments.

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:21.870
And you undoubtedly
will feel that it's

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:25.170
a great environment for
you to advance your career,

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:29.110
to conduct your research, to
teach with tremendous students,

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:31.260
and so on.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:35.000
What I want to urge you to do is
to look beyond your department,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.360
even to look beyond your school.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.770
And now I'm going
to be shameless

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:41.990
about this for a moment.

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:45.560
But one of the things that's
challenging about Harvard

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.250
is it's difficult to get
to know people who are not

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.570
in your immediate environment.

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:55.510
And we try to create
opportunities for you

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:56.420
to meet other people.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:59.770
This afternoon is one of them,
but we need to have many more

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:01.320
and we do have many more.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.750
And I want to urge you to
take advantage of them,

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.060
of those opportunities.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:11.730
If it's 4:30 in the
afternoon on a Wednesday,

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:14.860
you may have a stack of
student papers to grade,

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:19.180
referee reports to write,
recommendation letters

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.790
to write, a whole
series of things

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:24.040
that you have to do every day.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.270
And I know all of you
are very busy already.

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:29.270
And you have many, many
things weighing on you.

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:32.610
The easiest thing to do is to
always plow through the work

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:35.350
that you have ahead
of you and ignore

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:38.020
some of the invitations,
some of the seminars,

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.200
some of the
performances that you

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:45.060
get invited to in the normal
course of a week at Harvard.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:49.630
I want to urge you to think
about sometimes dropping

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:51.490
that work that you
need to do for a while

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:53.000
to take advantage of an event.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.010
Judy's office sponsors many
events to get faculty together.

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:00.886
Sometimes these are
special performances

00:09:00.886 --> 00:09:06.040
at the ART, the American
Repertory Theater,

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.850
arguably the greatest
regional theater in America,

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:10.970
which we also own.

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:14.360
But there are many, many
activities that she sponsors

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.445
and you will have other
activities of that kind.

00:09:16.445 --> 00:09:18.660
And what I want
to urge you to do

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.420
is get to know people
in other areas.

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.540
Go to a seminar
occasionally that's

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.090
outside your immediate
department or area,

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:28.910
but maybe that has some
loose relation to something

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:30.050
you're interested in.

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:31.040
Get out there.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.930
Get to know people who
aren't in your field.

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:36.860
Sometimes the way to
get to know other people

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:41.210
is through students that you may
share in common, particularly

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:42.770
at the graduate level.

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:45.110
But also undergraduates
can be a bridge.

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:48.580
Sometimes you will be invited by
your students to attend events

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:50.340
at the houses or in Annenberg.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.180
If they're freshmen,
they have faculty nights.

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:54.640
Accept those invitations.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.850
Not only get to know students,
get to know other faculty.

00:09:57.850 --> 00:09:59.450
There are many,
many opportunities,

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:04.720
and the biggest barrier is
the demands on your time.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.250
And those demands, as you
know, are to a great extent

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.870
internally imposed.

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:13.000
You'd certainly have
obligations to others

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.050
who make demands on
your time, but you

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:18.870
will have to make a decision
about what the priorities are.

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:21.730
It's not sacrificing your
career to take advantage

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:24.120
of some of these
riches and people

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.040
that Harvard has to offer.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:30.450
You will not have a fully
successful Harvard experience

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:34.370
if your entire academic life is
lived within your department.

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:37.780
So please, please take
advantage of the breadth

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:40.140
of what Harvard has to offer.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.960
You will sometimes even
find very direct payoffs

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:46.400
in terms of your work from
having interacted with people

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.800
outside your immediate area.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.810
The unexpected
collaboration or sometimes

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:52.900
you may read something
you wouldn't otherwise

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.320
read when you get to know
other people in the Harvard

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.200
environment outside your area.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.970
So make the most
of this experience.

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:02.260
I wish you every success.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:06.390
And Judy's office and
the provost's office

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:10.060
stand ready to help you
in every way we can.

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:12.400
Have a great experience.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.650
Let me just ask if
people have questions

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:16.060
or want to make any comments.

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:22.250
And let me add one other thing.

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:24.320
Don't let the
river be a barrier.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.930
Many of you are
here from the School

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:30.280
of Public Health, the med
school, the business school.

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:34.080
The river, it's a
very narrow river,

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.820
and the traffic can
be bad at rush hour

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:39.770
but it's pretty quick to get
in between during other times

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:40.270
of day.

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:43.080
And I would hate to
think of Longwood

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.750
as a different universe
or that Allston

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:46.910
is a different universe.

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:50.200
A lot of what we're going to be
doing in the next several years

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.810
is helping people understand
that Allston and Cambridge are

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:54.651
all one campus.

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:06.450
OK, thank you very much.

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:07.370
Good luck.

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:10.235
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:18.570
JUDITH D. SINGER:
Thank you, Alan.

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:21.070
I'm going to make a few
remarks about the university

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:24.660
before we go around the
room and say who we are

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:27.270
and what department we're in
so that people can get a chance

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:28.490
to know each other.

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:30.270
The first thing I'm
going to talk about

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:35.120
is-- I'm a statistician, so
I'll give some statistics.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:39.740
As Alan was implying,
Harvard is a huge place.

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:41.990
And not counting
the hospitals, which

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:47.050
have about 10,000 faculty, we
have 1,500 ladder faculty who

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:50.090
are spread across our campuses.

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:52.420
They are increasingly
diverse, which

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:56.170
is something we are
very much committed to.

00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:58.510
About 70% of the
faculty are tenured.

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:01.510
About 30% are tenure track.

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:03.020
29% are women.

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:05.270
That's an all time
high for Harvard.

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:07.410
It's really remarkable,
the progress

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:08.630
that we've been making.

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:12.250
And in the earlier ranks,
the fraction of women

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:14.740
is up to 38% which is
also an all time high.

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:18.030
So we're really making progress
in diversifying our faculty.

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:22.030
This year, 22% of our faculty
are members of minority groups.

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:23.720
That's an all time high.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:27.270
And once again, in the assistant
and associate professor ranks,

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:30.220
we're at about 30% minority.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.990
Your entering class
is also diverse.

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:37.080
39% female, 30% minority.

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.210
There are some places at
the Harvard faculty club

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:41.890
where all you see are
pictures of dead white men.

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:43.894
That's what Harvard was.

00:13:43.894 --> 00:13:45.560
So when you look
around the room and you

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:49.030
see very different
faces, it's a sense

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:50.420
that this is a new Harvard.

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:54.550
And that's an institution
that very much I

00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:57.410
want to be a part of and I
hope you want to be a part of.

00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:00.180
The other part of
Harvard that's changing

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:03.629
is to some extent it's the way
we're organized and structured,

00:14:03.629 --> 00:14:05.170
but it's also about
the opportunities

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:06.625
that Alan was talking about.

00:14:06.625 --> 00:14:10.470
You may hear people talk about
every tub on its own bottom,

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:12.400
or the tub system.

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.850
This is a system where the
budgets are decentralized.

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:18.750
Each dean controls
his or her budget.

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:22.170
And part of that tub
system contributed

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:26.540
to a lot of city-states that
were somewhat balkanized.

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:29.850
And part of the mission of the
provost's office in general,

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:33.660
but also President Faust
since she took office in 2007,

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:36.750
is the phrase we use
is "One Harvard."

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:40.350
We actually want this to be
a university where people

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:41.600
feel part of the university.

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.520
They can move across
the university.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:47.290
And that's what Alan was
trying to get at when he

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:49.742
was urging you to meet people.

00:14:49.742 --> 00:14:51.200
The other thing
we've discovered is

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.020
that newer people are much more
interested in meeting people

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.250
than people who've been
here for 30 or 40 years.

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:59.090
So part of today is
focused on people

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:04.400
who are new to the university
and giving them an opportunity

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.490
to get to know each other.

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:07.340
If you haven't signed
up for our geomap,

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.340
you should have gotten
something in your packet.

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:12.470
I just met somebody who's
living down the street from me.

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:14.350
So it's a good
opportunity to get

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:16.690
to know faculty who
live in your community.

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:18.220
Find people you
might carpool with

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:21.590
or have a barbecue with,
who might live near you

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:23.980
or have kids the same
age as your kids,

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:26.274
and to feel part of Harvard.

00:15:26.274 --> 00:15:27.940
Let me say a word
about today's program,

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:30.067
and then I'm going to have
us go around the room.

00:15:30.067 --> 00:15:32.400
The idea here is we're going
to have two faculty panels,

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.960
and I'm pleased to see the first
panel actually has arrived.

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:37.640
I was beginning to have
that fear you have,

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.130
where are my speakers?

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:41.180
Thank you for coming.

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:43.610
And the first panel
is going to be

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:46.860
from people who were
relatively recently promoted

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:48.650
from assistant to
associate professors

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:50.750
to tell those of you who
are assistant professors

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:53.410
that it actually can happen
and does happen at Harvard.

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:54.990
And then our second
panel is going

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:57.984
to be of some tenured
faculty who have been here

00:15:57.984 --> 00:15:59.900
for varying numbers of
years who will give you

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:03.240
a perspective on the
university that they

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.360
have from their perch.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.740
Some of the questions we've
asked people to talk about

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:10.660
are what are the
critical factors

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.810
essential to your
development and feeling

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:14.260
part of the university.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.520
What kinds of resources have you
found particularly effective?

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:20.350
Where do you go when
you have a question?

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:23.820
How do you find out how to
maneuver around this very

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:26.050
large and vast campus?

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:27.830
And how do you
develop relationships

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:30.750
and collaborations with faculty?

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:32.750
And how do you
balance those demands

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:37.010
of hunkering down and you've
got a paper you need to get out

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:39.200
and taking advantage
of those opportunities.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.700
And so different people have
different perspectives on this.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:44.160
And so what we're hoping
is by hearing these six

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.590
different voices who come
from different schools,

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:49.150
different disciplines, and are
at different career stages,

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:52.560
you'll get some food for thought
that hopefully will stimulate

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.300
your own thinking and
also conversations

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:57.540
that can take place at the
breaks and at receptions.

00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:00.140
Both of the panels are going to
be introduced by my colleague.

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:02.680
Elizabeth Ancarana, who's the
Assistant Provost for Faculty

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.390
Development and Diversity.

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:07.660
And I would say that if
you don't have a place

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:11.250
to go to ask a
question, Elizabeth, me,

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:13.310
we are open to all
kinds of questions.

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:15.410
And we can direct you
to the right place

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:16.960
if we're not the right place.

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.595
So to start breaking
down some barriers,

00:17:19.595 --> 00:17:20.970
let's go around
the room and have

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:22.740
everybody introduce themselves.

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:24.859
For time reasons,
let's keep it short.

00:17:24.859 --> 00:17:28.790
So basically your
name, your school,

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:30.450
and your department or field.

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:35.020
And one sentence
about your research.

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:35.688
Hit it.

00:17:37.462 --> 00:17:38.920
NATASHA SUMNER:
I'm Natasha Sumner.

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.560
I'm in Celtic Languages
and Literatures.

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:48.220
And I work on a heroic corpus
in Irish and Scottish Gaelic.

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:49.806
JUDITH D. SINGER: Perfect.

00:17:49.806 --> 00:17:50.930
SCOTT CARTER: Scott Carter.

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:53.513
I'm a computational biologist
at the Harvard School for Public

00:17:53.513 --> 00:17:54.920
Health in the Dana-Farber.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:59.430
I'm working on human cancer,
genetics, and evolution.

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:02.100
MATTHEW HERSCH: Matthew Hersch,
faculty of Arts and Sciences,

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:03.520
History of Science.

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.175

wanted to echo Judy's comments

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:37.450
about how we really are
here for you as a resource.

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:40.080
In addition to our colleagues
in the dean's offices,

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.910
in your departments, your
department chairs, et cetera,

00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:46.160
over the years Judy and
I and our colleagues

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:50.790
have amassed a vast
network of people

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:53.810
that we can help to
introduce and connect you

00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:56.629
to as you navigate
your experience right

00:25:56.629 --> 00:25:58.420
now in the beginning
during your transition

00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:00.940
to Harvard and the
Cambridge-Boston area,

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:05.550
but as you develop and progress
through your career at Harvard.

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:08.610
I was in the FAS doing faculty
recruitment for a decade

00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:12.590
before moving into the provost's
office almost three years ago.

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:15.540
And a lot of faculty
come our way,

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:18.311
and it's just such a pleasure
to work with all of you.

00:26:18.311 --> 00:26:20.810
So any time you have a question,
you don't know where to go,

00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:23.210
you don't know who to
ask, give us a ring

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:27.100
and we'll make sure
you're doing just fine.
