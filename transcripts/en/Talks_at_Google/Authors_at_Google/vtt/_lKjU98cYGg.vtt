DOUG LIPP: Welcome.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:09.290
Thank you for being here today.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.331
And I would like to share
with you some thoughts.

00:00:11.331 --> 00:00:15.180
And [? Marjay ?] talked a
little bit about my background--

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.250
a bit more is I
work for Disneyland.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.790
My first job at Disney,
outside of being an intern,

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.125
was as a Japanese interpreter.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.080
My second language
is Japanese, and I

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.850
was doing some work
for the newly hired,

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.102
newly brought on
board executives

00:00:31.102 --> 00:00:32.810
from Japan that were
going to be starting

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.200
our first international
theme park.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.700
So while I was a college
student working at Disneyland,

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.880
I was studying Japanese.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.230
And I knew that they
were going to go

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.480
into the international market.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.320
But I wasn't sure
when and where.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.940
And when I was in
grad school in Tokyo

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.620
I got a message from a colleague
who said they decided on Tokyo.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.660
So I knew I had to come back.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.786
And the first thing out
of the executive's mouth,

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:54.410
he said, well, you
know, Disney's style

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.500
is you've got to
start at the bottom.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.890
So you can either start as
a ride operator, a street

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.145
sweeper, or an interpreter.

00:00:59.145 --> 00:01:00.630
And I said I'll
be an interpreter.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.000
That's what I'm doing.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.180
And I got exposed to the men and
women who ran the university.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.920
I got to work with a
lot of great people

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.310
and start a whole new project.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.309
And you know what it's
like to start new things.

00:01:11.309 --> 00:01:12.450
You wear lots of hats.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.860
So I went from Disneyland
and then I went to Japan.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.580
I was transferred back to
Japan for several years.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.510
So I got to live in Japan
as a starving student and as

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.270
a ridiculously overpaid expat.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.745
And it's a lot better to be
a ridiculously paid expat.

00:01:24.745 --> 00:01:26.870
And I spent several years
there getting the park up

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:27.370
and running.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.797
And I'll share with you a
couple of stories from that.

00:01:29.797 --> 00:01:32.130
And then I came back, and I
went to Disney headquarters,

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.500
which is their studios.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.110
And the whole time I was
in the Disney organization,

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.610
I was exposed to
men and women who

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.210
worked directly
with Walt Disney.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.110
Now, you probably don't
realize how blessed

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.880
you are to be in
such a young company.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.230
What are you celebrating--
Sweet 16 this year, right?

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.490
And you have contact with
Larry, with Sergey, with Eric.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.190
I never got to meet Walt Disney.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.750
Walt Disney passed away
in 1966, and in those days

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.850
they were not hiring
11-year-olds to run

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:05.940
the company.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.259
But the men and women
that mentored me did

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.679
get to work with Walt.

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.970
So I'm going to share with
you some thoughts about that

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.650
as we go along.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.040
Is the slide-- woohoo!

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.814
That's why your heads are
going like this right now.

00:02:17.814 --> 00:02:19.230
As that gets set
up and running, I

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.290
want to share with you
something else just

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.550
to set the tone for what
an amazingly qualified guy

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.220
I am to be speaking
to you today.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.970
You know, you at Google
are so cocky about how

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.240
cool your culture is
and how fun it is.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.155
You got nothing on Disney.

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.040
When I worked at the studios,
I participated in a voice

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.000
contest-- a voice contest-- we
lovingly called it a quack-off.

00:02:47.012 --> 00:02:47.720
Think about that.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.060
You can't say that
word in Missouri,

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.480
but you could say in California.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.470
I participated in
a voice contest

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.895
to celebrate Donald
Duck's birthday.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.800
This was put on by what's
called the Mickey Mouse Activity

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.330
Center, which is the activity
center for all the employees.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.430
You have all the
recreation, canoe races,

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.880
all kinds of stuff, right?

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.180
It makes Googleplex look
like a boring library.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.350
And I participated in this
only because the woman who

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.570
was in charge of putting it
on had kind of caught my eye.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.124
I thought she was kind of cool
looking, and she kept saying,

00:03:20.124 --> 00:03:22.040
would you please participate
in the quack-off?

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.029
We need more quackers.

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:24.445
We need to have
more participants.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.990
And I thought, well,
maybe if I participate,

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.400
you'll go on a date with me.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.340
So I did, and I won
the competition.

00:03:34.697 --> 00:03:36.280
And I won the girl,
and she's actually

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.210
in the back of the
room right there

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.729
in that beautiful blue dress.

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:39.520
Hello, [INAUDIBLE]!

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.220
Actually, it was kind of
a surreal environment.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.820
The man who was the
emcee of the activity

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.561
was the voice of Mickey Mouse.

00:03:49.561 --> 00:03:52.060
Well, at the time, the guy who
was the voice of Mickey Mouse

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.970
was about 6' 3",
had a full beard.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.220
He looked like a lumberjack,
[MICKEY MOUSE IMPRESSION]

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.920
but he talked like this.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.810
So it was really surreal to
look up at this giant guy

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.660
and think, oh my
gosh, that's Mickey.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.340
And the man who had been the
voice of Donald for years

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.260
was going to retire.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.400
He was in his mid '80s.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.320
His name was
Clarence Ducky Nash.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.871
And so we participated in
this quack-off and I won.

00:04:15.871 --> 00:04:17.620
(DONALD DUCK IMPRESSION)
Hello, everybody.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.845
How are you today?

00:04:18.845 --> 00:04:20.266
Ah-- ah-- ah-choo.

00:04:22.198 --> 00:04:25.096
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.760
And the guy who came
in second is now

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.950
the voice of Donald Duck.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:32.500
Go figure.

00:04:34.147 --> 00:04:36.355
But anyway, I really want
to think about-- this is up

00:04:36.355 --> 00:04:38.938
and running now? [? Marjay, ?]
thank you-- leadership, service

00:04:38.938 --> 00:04:39.630
magic.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.670
I'm going to share with you
some thoughts today about both

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.740
my career Disney,
but more importantly,

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.150
some of the lessons
that I learned,

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.980
and they are in this
bestselling book.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.490
You can use it as a door stop.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:52.990
You can use it as a sleep aid.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.810
It's really cool.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.662
No, actually,
based on subsidies,

00:04:55.662 --> 00:04:57.120
you guys have a
pretty good dealer.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.980
And I just want to let
you know, for those of you

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.470
that buy this book,
we are donating

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.580
all proceeds to an organization
called NAMI-- National

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.000
Alliance on Mental
Illness-- to help reduce

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.540
the stigma associated with that.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.140
But in here I have quotes.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.430
I have ideas from
many men and women,

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.770
but in particular,
the man who I referred

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.560
to earlier as the
mentor that helped me

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.720
for many, many years--
a guy named Van France.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.040
Van France was hired directly
by Walt Disney in early 1955.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.770
Disneyland opened
in July of '55.

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.630
And Walt was smart
enough to realize

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.990
that he and his team of
designers, architects,

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.760
construction people,
ride engineers,

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.250
were architects of
things, of science.

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.390
And they needed a person to
be the architect of people

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:45.240
development.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.400
Much like you have a
chief cultural officer--

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.010
HR director-- Van
France would've

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.340
been the chief cultural
officer of the day.

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.026
And he's the one who started
the Disney University.

00:05:56.026 --> 00:05:57.900
It wasn't known as the
University originally,

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.300
but he's the man who
created the university.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.340
So I want to share with you some
thoughts about what Van brought

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.140
to the table and compare
and contrast, seriously,

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.310
the amazing culture
that you belong to.

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.110
You think about Googlers and
Nooglers and Googleplex and all

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.850
of the vernacular that
this young company

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:19.054
has created in such a
short amount of time.

00:06:19.054 --> 00:06:20.970
You have to have a
tremendous amount of pride.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.850
I feel the same
way about Disney.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.590
We had our own vernacular
which has lived--

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:31.000
Disneyland is going on 60
years of age now-- cast member,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.895
on-stage, backstage,
good show, bad show.

00:06:34.895 --> 00:06:35.770
But here's the point.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.420
The culture is a lot
more than just words.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.070
It's a lot more than
fanciful colored bikes.

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.220
It's a lot more
than free lunches.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:45.930
It's a lot of hard work.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.240
And I'll share with
you briefly how

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.660
we squandered that at Disney.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.390
We actually almost
lost the entire company

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:57.100
not once, but twice,
in a 20-year period,

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.080
despite the name recognition,
the international brand,

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.420
and love for all the characters
and all the attractions we'd

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.740
built, and movies and songs
and that sort of thing.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:09.730
So yes, enjoy your
unique culture

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.900
and your position in
the world and constantly

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.100
being put on a
pedestal and recognized

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.360
as one of the best employers
in the world and to have such

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.910
a great environment
in which to work.

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:20.710
I envy you.

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:23.430
Enjoy it while you
have it right now.

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:24.830
Enjoy it in your youth.

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:27.250
Enjoy it as you
get older, as well.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:30.140
So I'm going to share with
you a thought from Van

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.770
France in this slide I've
got right now-- capturing

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:37.960
hearts and minds fosters
trust and innovation.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.870
Again, Walt Disney
was smart enough

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:43.339
to realize that his team and he
had to focus on the hardware,

00:07:43.339 --> 00:07:44.880
on the rides, and
on the attractions.

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:48.690
But who was going to
get those cast members

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:50.990
on board that were
going to create

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:52.830
the happiest place on earth?

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:55.450
People that didn't know a
thing about theme parks,

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:57.620
because theme parks had
not yet been invented.

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:02.160
16-year-olds to 85-year-olds,
and everything in between--

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.650
how do we do that?

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:05.800
And so Van created
this environment.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.510
And he learned that that
environment existed for decades

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:12.230
before he ever saw Disneyland.

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:14.980
Let me read one little
excerpt from the book

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:19.960
that I use to kind of set
the tone for what Van walked

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:24.120
into when he realized that
his own quirky sense of humor

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.510
was going to fit in
perfectly with Walt Disney's

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:27.770
quirky sense of humor.

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:33.200
So I say in here, "Van
first met Walt in 1954.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.289
Then he was asked
to join the company.

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:38.623
He said, I was asked
to meet Walt Disney.

00:08:38.623 --> 00:08:40.789
And the meeting was held
in the animation building."

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:43.767
This is where all the artists
reside at the Disney Studios

00:08:43.767 --> 00:08:44.725
in Burbank, California.

00:08:46.011 --> 00:08:48.010
"The meeting was held in
the animation building,

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:49.200
home to all the artists.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.030
And it's also were Walt's
office was located.

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:56.020
I parked in the visitor's
lot and set off on foot

00:08:56.020 --> 00:09:00.230
down Snow White Lane,
past Dopey Drive,

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:04.140
until I came to Mickey Mouse
Avenue and the studio's

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.630
three-story animation building."

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.670
This is from a man who worked
in World War II factories.

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:11.970
He worked in aluminum
smelting plants.

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:14.380
He worked in anything
but a fun environment,

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:17.260
but he was an irascible
character himself.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.320
In fact, one of the
ways the we described

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.272
Van France to our
fellow colleagues

00:09:21.272 --> 00:09:22.730
who never got a
chance to meet him,

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:26.600
was he was a combination of
a Snow White-kind of person,

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.060
but really he was more
like Mary Poppins.

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:32.410
He was beautiful
in soul and spirit.

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:35.480
And he was a guiding
light like Mary Poppins.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.680
He was like Jiminy
Cricket guiding Pinocchio

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:39.790
down the right path.

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:44.760
So we kept us on track to keep
Walt Disney's dream alive.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.950
But he was also like
an angry Donald Duck.

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:48.770
And Donald's known to
have a short temper.

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:52.320
And if you gave excuses,
he would get in your grill

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.750
immediately and let you know
in no uncertain terms what

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:56.840
was wrong and how
you had to fix it.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.290
In fact, one of Walt's
favorite quotes-- and Van

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:03.485
taught this to me-- was "don't
come to me with no, because.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.570
Come to me with yes, if."

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:09.240
And that opened up
all kinds of doors

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.615
of creativity and opportunity.

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:14.780
So this thing about capturing
hearts and minds-- and one

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:17.865
of the things we tried
to do-- and I think

00:10:17.865 --> 00:10:19.740
did it pretty well in
the Disney University--

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:23.490
when we would have new
hire orientation every week

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:25.830
before a busy season at
Disneyland or Walt Disney

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:26.610
World.

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:29.370
We'd have 60 to 80
to 90 new hires.

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:31.100
We didn't call then
Nooglers like you do,

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:34.050
but they were just called
new hires-- new cast members.

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.330
And we had eight hours
to inculcate them,

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.020
to get them excited.

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:40.360
And in addition a sprinkling
a lot of pixie dust

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.193
on their heads, we did
a lot of other things

00:10:42.193 --> 00:10:43.861
to capture their
hearts and minds.

00:10:43.861 --> 00:10:45.860
And one of the most
important things that we did

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:49.400
was this-- we talked about
the importance of teamwork,

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.050
of cleanliness, and friendliness
that our customers paid

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:53.940
a premium for.

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:56.570
They'd pay a premium to come
to Disney, because it's clean.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:58.940
It's safe, and the rides work.

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:02.140
Yes, Universal Studios might
have faster, sexier rides,

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:03.550
but they break
down all the time.

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:06.030
And they might have more
employees, but they're snarky.

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:08.517
If you ask a Universal
employee, where's the washroom,

00:11:08.517 --> 00:11:10.100
they're going to
say, it's over there.

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:11.374
Can't you smell it?

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:14.600
But if you ask a
Disney employee,

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.220
they're going to stop.

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:17.303
They're going to look at
you, and say, sir, ma'am,

00:11:17.303 --> 00:11:19.720
it's right this way,
with an open palm.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.250
But we would talk about this.

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:22.800
We would show videos.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.600
But it's still at
the cognitive level.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.050
It's just at the brain level.

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:28.110
How do we capture their hearts?

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:30.620
And so the last
hour of orientation,

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.355
we would take them
through the park.

00:11:33.929 --> 00:11:35.470
We would talk about
the architecture.

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:38.600
We would talk about the
theming, but our primary goal

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.430
was for them to see
with their own eyes

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:45.090
multiple examples of
non-custodial personnel bending

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:47.580
over and picking up
trash, executives going

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:51.350
to and from staff meetings,
cast members-- obviously

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:54.270
not custodians-- going
to or from breaks,

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:55.810
bending over and
picking up trash,

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:58.060
and as soon as my
new hires saw that, I

00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:59.730
know that I've
captured their hearts.

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:01.515
Now they're thinking,
oh, yes, what

00:12:01.515 --> 00:12:03.890
they talked about there in
the Never Never Land of Disney

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:06.070
University actually happens.

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:08.905
Where, all too often
I see organizations--

00:12:08.905 --> 00:12:11.660
and I'm not saying Google--
but a lot of organizations

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:14.630
try to emulate the Google
culture, the Disney

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:17.540
culture, and metaphorically--
like I have on the slide here--

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:22.261
try to put up a coat of paint
on a dilapidated, run-down

00:12:22.261 --> 00:12:22.760
building.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.640
The culture isn't strong,
or it's not even set up yet.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.150
But they think just by
having fanciful names,

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:30.130
colorful t-shirts, or
really cool posters

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:32.450
on the wall, that'll
make people buy in.

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:34.750
Ultimately those posters
become the butt of jokes

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:38.010
if people aren't living
and breathing that culture.

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:40.672
To this day, I can't
walk across the property,

00:12:40.672 --> 00:12:42.130
see a piece of
trash on the ground,

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:45.960
and not go into the automatic
robot rote of must bend over

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:46.885
and pick up trash.

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:53.170
So kudos to you, for in
a short amount of time,

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:55.950
creating such a strong
culture, because culture

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:59.380
happens in one of two
ways-- either by design,

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.180
or by benign neglect.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.340
And all too often I
see benign neglect

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:06.602
taking the stage, people not
really trying to mold it,

00:13:06.602 --> 00:13:07.560
just letting it happen.

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:10.500
I also want to open
up, and I talked

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.220
to [? Marjay ?] about this--
if you have questions,

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:16.295
if you have comments,
let's open up right now

00:13:16.295 --> 00:13:17.452
and say it's OK to do that.

00:13:17.452 --> 00:13:19.410
We have a microphone
we're going to run around.

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:20.546
Please don't hold back.

00:13:20.546 --> 00:13:22.420
If you're sitting there
thinking, well, yeah,

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:24.270
Doug, it sounds great,
but how do you do it,

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:27.280
or what does that really mean,
or I agree, or I disagree,

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:27.780
let me know.

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.060
Does anybody have any
questions-- any clarification

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.230
necessary at this time?

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:32.430
We've got mic runners.

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:33.770
Where's the mic?

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:34.270
Right there.

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:35.061
All right, anybody?

00:13:35.061 --> 00:13:36.140
Yes, sir, in the back.

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:37.120
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.790
I'd love to hear
more about how you

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:43.120
got beyond the cognitive
level of helping people absorb

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.980
that culture and even
the reinforcement.

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:49.880
DOUG LIPP: Getting beyond the
cognitive level is really--

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.640
what was being said in the
classroom in the Disney

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:57.300
University was happening
every day on the job.

00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.070
And so it didn't remove it
from the cognitive level.

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:04.290
It just blended the cognitive
and the gut level into one.

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:07.000
There was congruence
between the message,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.170
because in the
University, we had

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:11.630
people who had
operations background.

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:13.410
Operations people
always filtered

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:14.870
through the University.

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:17.870
So when you walked out as
a newly hired employee,

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:21.040
or as a mid-level manager,
or when Michael Eisner

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:24.090
joined the company-- and I had
him in the Disney University.

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:25.670
In fact on the
back of that book,

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:28.190
you'll see Michael wrote
a testimonial saying, when

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:31.580
I joined Disney as the CEO,
I had to go back to school,

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:35.200
to the University-- when the
CEO walks into the University

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.320
as the equivalent
of a Noogler, that

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.940
sends a massively powerful
message to everybody

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:41.290
else in the organization.

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:44.590
When I was in charge of training
at Disney Studios, that's

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:47.540
a whole different ball
game, training 35-

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:49.980
to 85-year-old
Hollywood executives--

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:52.990
they're a tough crowd-- versus
the bright-eyed, bushy-tailed

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:54.990
kids you get at Disney
World or Disneyland.

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:56.880
I wasn't going to fight
the battle of having

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.830
a discussion about
creativity with them.

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:03.340
I would call in the chairman of
Disney Studios, Dick Cook, who

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:06.550
was in charge of running
a huge corporation.

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:08.590
He's the man who
brought in Johnny Depp

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:10.844
to do all the "Pirates" series.

00:15:10.844 --> 00:15:12.260
When he walked in
a room and said,

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.230
hey, let's have a
discussion for 30 minutes

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:16.850
about the creative process
of creating a film,

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:18.810
you capture people's
hearts and minds.

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:20.660
And that was the
message is that, if it's

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.830
good enough for a
16-year-old new hire,

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:24.720
it's good enough for
that senior executive

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:25.800
and everybody in between.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.740
So that became part
of the culture.

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:29.650
And when it becomes
part of the culture,

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:31.450
you take it out of
the cognitive realm

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:32.890
and you put it
right in the heart.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:34.150
All right, so let's push on.

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:37.080
Again, in short, the
Disney University

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.630
is not a standalone
fix-it operation.

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:42.550
It's a vehicle for the
culture of the organization.

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:45.172
It's part and parcel to what
the company's all about.

00:15:45.172 --> 00:15:46.630
So what I'm showing
you right now--

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:48.190
and it really does feed
in nicely, in fact.

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:49.106
Thank you for the cue.

00:15:49.106 --> 00:15:51.240
You'll get your bonus
after the presentation's

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:55.130
over-- Van France,
again, my mentor, talked

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:58.490
about why does the
University survive?

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:01.030
And I have to tell you as a
training and development OD

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:02.950
specialist-- I
consult with companies

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:05.050
all around the
world-- all too often

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:08.010
I have people who will challenge
me and say, well, of course,

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:10.240
the Disney University
has success.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.080
I mean, if I had
Mickey Mouse leading

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.910
a cheer for my
employees, I'd have

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:15.540
no problem getting
people in the room.

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:20.050
If I had posters of Walt
Disney holding all of his Oscar

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:21.810
awards, I'd have no problem.

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:25.560
In fact, the Oscar the Walt won
for "Snow White and the Seven

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:26.980
Dwarfs" is really cool.

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:28.710
Has anybody ever seen it?

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:31.760
It's-- of course the
AV guy's seen it--

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.030
the other old guy in
the room has seen it--

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:38.010
it's a single Oscar with seven
baby Oscars lined up next

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:40.540
to it, representing the seven
dwarfs-- posters of that,

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:43.417
pictures of that,
all over the company.

00:16:43.417 --> 00:16:45.750
So their point-- non-Disney
people will say, well, yeah,

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:50.290
if I had those fanciful names
and the soundtrack of "Lion

00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:52.580
King" and "Hakuna Matata"
playing in the background

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:55.019
when I go in to
orientation, of course

00:16:55.019 --> 00:16:56.060
I'm going to be thrilled.

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:59.480
And I say, yes, but what if
that message that you learned in

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:02.430
that training program is not
alive and well on the front

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:02.960
lines?

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:05.240
And that new hire, or
that senior executive,

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.750
goes into the park, or goes
back to his or her job,

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:09.250
and somebody else
says, I don't care

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:12.190
what they say in that
brainwashing factory called

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:13.339
Disney University.

00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:16.270
The real message is right
here, so forget all that crap.

00:17:17.176 --> 00:17:18.800
That would be a
complete waste of time.

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:20.710
And all too often, I
go into organizations,

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:23.349
and I actually recommend they
get rid of their training

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:26.230
department, or at least
their training curriculum,

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:28.790
because it's not in
tune with real life.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.740
And I'm a firm
believer in training.

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:33.031
Everybody should have training.

00:17:33.031 --> 00:17:35.120
But it doesn't always
have to be in a classroom.

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.140
It could be one-on-one.

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:37.056
It could be mentoring.

00:17:37.056 --> 00:17:39.470
It could be in five-minute
bursts throughout the day

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:40.935
or throughout the week.

00:17:40.935 --> 00:17:43.060
But this is what-- again
getting back to these four

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:45.910
circumstances that Van
France talked about,

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:48.020
and I write about
extensively in "Disney U,"

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:50.730
because "Disney U," the
book, is about values that

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:53.890
are timeless and applicable
in the organization.

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:55.070
And I work with hospitals.

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:57.520
I work with mom and pop
stores, and everything

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:01.040
in between-- so Van
said this new baby

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:04.620
in the corporate family
would not have survived,

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:07.690
were it not for four
circumstances-- essentially

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:10.490
four values, and these
values represent, I think,

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:12.220
the essence of the
Disney organization,

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:14.110
and I think of all the
companies that I've

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:16.550
worked with over the years,
you can relate to this

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:18.520
more so than anybody.

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:20.670
So the first one is that
Disney as an organization

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:21.253
of innovation.

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:24.390
You know about innovation.

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:25.848
There's nothing to
talk about here,

00:18:25.848 --> 00:18:27.290
but what I want
you think about is

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:30.640
with your own approach in
sales or services, how much

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:32.390
do you innovate?

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:34.320
Yes, the company
is known for this.

00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:37.870
You've got Google X.
You've got innovation time.

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:39.870
You've got all kinds of
things, but how much are

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:42.330
you personally challenging
yourself every day

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:44.010
to innovate and take
calculated risk?

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:49.260
It's about support--
leadership support--

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.510
the example I just gave you
of Dick Cook, the chairman

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:54.040
of Disney Studios,
coming in and leading

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:56.460
a 30-minute discussion
about creativity,

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:58.930
or the chairman of
Disney Imagineering,

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:03.500
a guy named Marty Sklar, who
would also work with executives

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:05.760
and front-line
employees to develop

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.970
creative approaches
to solving problems.

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:10.400
He had something that he
called "the white sheet

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.336
of paper approach."

00:19:12.336 --> 00:19:13.960
He writes about it
in one of his books.

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:16.370
And my wife and I were
recently with them,

00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:18.800
spending a whole weekend with
him going over some things,

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.550
and we're going to see
him tomorrow night.

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:26.530
He said, my staff of Imagineers,
of animators, of creative types

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:27.465
had massive stress.

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:30.670
There's 11 Disney theme
parks around the world--

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:33.310
soon to be 12, with
Shanghai opening next year.

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:35.500
And he said, the
pressure to outdo

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:38.590
what you just did last
year in that theme park,

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:40.570
or on that ride, or in
that movie is massive.

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:44.290
And so the metaphor that he
used was this piece of paper.

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:46.780
He said, it's like staring
at a blank piece of paper--

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:49.030
even if it's a computer
screen, it doesn't matter--

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:51.560
but that blank piece of
paper scared the heck out

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.380
of a lot of my Imagineers.

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:56.550
And so I said-- this is Marty
now-- and so I said to them,

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:59.790
you can look at that blank sheet
of paper in one of two ways.

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:02.470
You can look at it and say, oh
my gosh, I'm so intimidated,

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:05.740
because I have to put the
first words on that paper.

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:07.810
Or you can look at it
and say, oh my gosh,

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:08.957
isn't this exciting?

00:20:08.957 --> 00:20:10.540
I'm the one who gets
to be the one who

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:12.630
writes the first
words on this paper.

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:16.190
So that's innovation.

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:19.020
That's support from a
guy named Marty Sklar,

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:22.620
who himself was a writer,
who himself pitched directly

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:26.680
to Walt Disney the idea for the
$0.10 Disneyland newspaper that

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:29.270
was sold for years on
Main Street of Disneyland.

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:31.050
And he pitched that
idea to Walt Disney

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:32.730
when he was a junior at UCLA.

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:38.060
So it can happen at any level.

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:42.770
Thankfully your corporation
encourages innovation,

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:44.780
and you have tremendous support.

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:49.990
It's about education and
the value of education.

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:54.750
Another, I think,
eerily similar value,

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:57.470
and something that's happening
right here in this room today,

00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:59.511
is something that happened
at the Disney Studios.

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:03.680
In the mid-1930s,
Walt Disney wanted

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:06.750
to send his animators
to art school

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:10.150
to help them be more
creative, and he

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:11.860
found that the art
schools of the day

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:15.730
were very limited in their
scope of creativity, actually.

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:19.220
They actually forced people
into certain boxes and drawing

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:22.180
styles that Walt didn't
support, but again,

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:26.400
in his inimitable style of
"no, because as opposed to yes,

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:29.730
if"-- let's forget about sending
our people to art school.

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:33.300
Let's invite thought
leaders into Disney Studios.

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:34.840
And this is in the 1930s.

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:37.390
He actually invited
Frank Lloyd Wright

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:39.190
to come in and talk
to the animators

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:41.000
about how to draw
a better Bambi.

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:43.840
What is the connection there?

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:47.510
What they wound up doing,
was they brought a live deer

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:50.210
into the sound stage,
and they put it

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:52.340
on a pile of alfalfa hay.

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:54.670
Now the deer is
munching on alfalfa hay.

00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:57.590
And then around the deer
sit a bunch of animators,

00:21:57.590 --> 00:22:01.660
ostensibly viewing a deer
in its natural resource,

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:03.530
moving and eating.

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:07.190
In the day that was
mind-alteringly creative,

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:09.130
because up until that
point animators had

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:11.760
to look at real fuzzy
black and white films,

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:13.470
or they had to look
at photographs.

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:15.530
They didn't actually
get to see the muscle

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:17.530
twitch of the animal,
or how the jaw moved

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:19.500
when it ate the alfalfa.

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:21.920
And after listening to Frank
Lloyd Wright come in and give

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:23.870
them ideas about
what he went through

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:26.110
to create a new
building, they did that.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.250
Education and
constantly learning--

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:33.210
what you're doing
with the author series

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:36.320
is exactly that-- constantly
looking at new ideas,

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:39.560
and if you can just pick up one
or two snippets of information,

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:41.920
you're farther ahead
than anybody else.

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:46.860
And then finally,
it's about entertain--

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:50.500
having some fun--
having some fun.

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:53.670
One of my most favorite
Walt Disney quotes,

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:56.370
and it's-- again, for those
of you lucky few who picked up

00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:56.870
this book.

00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:59.022
It's actually put it
on the inside jacket,

00:22:59.022 --> 00:23:00.480
because I love it
so much, and this

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:04.100
is the quote-- "when
the subject permits,

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:08.680
we let fly with all the satire
and gags at our command."

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:14.870
And here's the key-- "laughter
is no enemy to learning."

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:16.370
"Laughter is no
enemy to learning."

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:18.370
It doesn't mean
that you belittle

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:19.380
learning opportunities.

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:21.500
It means that you
make them enjoyable.

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.400
It means that you
make them memorable.

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.274
And so that's part of
the answer, gentleman

00:23:25.274 --> 00:23:27.440
in the back-- that guy in
blue shirt that asked me--

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:30.167
oh, wake up, yep, yep, yep,
you're back on stage, OK--

00:23:30.167 --> 00:23:32.125
that's how you take it
from the cognitive realm

00:23:32.125 --> 00:23:35.630
and move into the heart,
is you make it memorable,

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:36.870
and you make it sink in.

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:38.250
Yes, it's important.

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:40.660
But let's not make it
mind-numbingly boring.

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:43.510
The other reason
you are so blessed,

00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:46.860
is you live within-- depending
on the time of day-- right

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:49.140
now would be at least
an eight-hour commute

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:50.951
to downtown San Francisco.

00:23:50.951 --> 00:23:52.700
Take one of your Google
vans, and go ahead

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:55.200
and get past all the people
that are complaining about that,

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.390
go to the Presidio, and go to
the Walt Disney Family Museum.

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:00.640
Has anybody ever been there--
the Walt Disney Family--

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.500
isn't that a beautiful property?

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:03.919
It is a great place.

00:24:03.919 --> 00:24:04.960
It's only five years old.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:07.330
It was started by
Walt's daughter Diane.

00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:09.820
My wife and I have been
working with museum

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:12.670
for the last couple of years
and looking at opportunities

00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:15.990
to turn that museum into a
living laboratory, because it's

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:21.280
full of examples of creativity
and dealing with adversity,

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:24.520
and there is a great
little example of entertain

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:26.615
and educate at the same time.

00:24:26.615 --> 00:24:29.920
Of all of the beautiful displays
that are in this museum,

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.440
the one that caught
my eye the most

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.470
was a small piece of
paper that was framed.

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:37.010
And it had a fanciful
picture of a guy.

00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:38.500
It was a cartoon
that Walt Disney

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.830
had drawn as a high
school student.

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:43.080
So I can only imagine Walt
Disney as a high school

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:46.960
student sitting in some boring
lecture, just doodling away.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:50.680
And the quote at the top of
that is what caught my eye.

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:53.870
And it says this-- "develop
your sense of humor,

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:56.600
and eventually it
will develop you."

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:58.635
"Develop your sense of
humor, and eventually

00:24:58.635 --> 00:24:59.510
it will develop you."

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:02.300
And that's the essence of what
the Disney organization is all

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:05.680
about, is entertain and
educate at the same time.

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:09.957
Comments, questions,
clarification-- anybody at all?

00:25:09.957 --> 00:25:12.540
AUDIENCE: How do you-- and I'm
an instructional designer here,

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:18.470
so trainer-- how do you,
in that new hire level,

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:21.200
stop some maybe bad
cultural traits that

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.160
are possible with that kind
of mythos that comes up,

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:28.360
such as traits like entitlement,
or these types of things that

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:31.580
might happen, or
could possibly be

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:35.361
a true aspect of the current
culture at said organization?

00:25:35.361 --> 00:25:37.360
I know you said you were
going to talk about how

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:40.910
your organization perhaps
almost failed twice.

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:43.240
And I'm not trying to be
rude or anything like that.

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:44.520
I'm really curious about this.

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:45.890
DOUG LIPP: You're way too nice.

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:48.265
AUDIENCE: No, no, no, no I
don't want this to been seen--

00:25:48.265 --> 00:25:51.350
I promise I'm not trying to
be facetious or sarcastic--

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:52.840
I actually really care.

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:53.830
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:54.705
DOUG LIPP: Thank you.

00:25:54.705 --> 00:25:58.010
Thank you for asking, and
the point that you bring up

00:25:58.010 --> 00:26:01.490
is something that every
organization sooner or later

00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:02.800
faces.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.710
And most organizations
do a terrible job

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:06.970
of dealing with it.

00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:09.440
In fact, they realize
after the fact

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:11.190
that it's happened to them.

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:15.140
So I'm going to answer your
question in a little bit

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:16.189
roundabout way.

00:26:16.189 --> 00:26:17.480
But keep my feet to the flames.

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:20.340
If I don't zero in on what
you're asking, get back to me,

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:20.850
OK?

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:23.340
Specifically, he's saying
in the onboarding experience

00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:25.560
for the new hire, how
do you set that tone?

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:28.510
I think it's that
and everything else,

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:31.060
because what
oftentimes happens, A,

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:35.130
the onboarding experience
is too late, in my opinion.

00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:38.675
And I know that Google has a
tremendously unique interview

00:26:38.675 --> 00:26:39.175
process.

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.860
That's where most
organizations fall flat.

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:45.240
I call it hire right,
train right, treat right.

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.700
That's the consultant
response-- hire right.

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:49.520
Get the right people on board.

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:54.170
I don't care how well-developed
your onboarding process is,

00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:56.800
or how well-developed
your mid-career training

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:59.040
programs are, if you
have the wrong substrate

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:01.260
from the get go, you're done.

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:03.520
So make sure you get the
right people on board,

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:06.130
and then you make sure that
you onboard them properly,

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:08.230
and properly is a loaded term.

00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:11.090
I mean, at Disney it
is very methodical.

00:27:12.749 --> 00:27:15.040
I understand that at Google--
depending on the position

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:16.310
you're in-- sometimes
you're kind of thrown

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:18.810
into the deep end, and you get
to figure it out on your own,

00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:20.935
but that is something that
you buy into when you're

00:27:20.935 --> 00:27:22.434
going through the
interview process.

00:27:22.434 --> 00:27:24.361
That's part of the
culture, is you have to go

00:27:24.361 --> 00:27:25.610
and figure it out on your own.

00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:28.800
If I did that in another
company that for decades

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:31.080
has had a methodical
onboarding process,

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:33.660
that won't be fair to new hires.

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:35.210
So get the right
people on board,

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:36.940
train them properly
for their jobs,

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:39.930
but then don't think of that
onboarding as the one shot

00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:40.960
inoculation.

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:44.470
It has to be an ongoing process
of continuous education.

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:48.710
So let me just show
some slides to you.

00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:52.690
In the evolution
of an organization,

00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:54.560
you're going to
expand, hopefully,

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:56.180
into lots of different markets.

00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:58.530
You're going to expand in
the kinds and types of people

00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:00.480
you hire and serve.

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:03.964
And what I'm showing here,
through these circles,

00:28:03.964 --> 00:28:04.880
is different cultures.

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.338
It could be linguistic
differences.

00:28:06.338 --> 00:28:08.010
It could be cultural
differences.

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:11.920
It could be age differences,
regional differences.

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:13.750
And unfortunately,
all too often,

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:16.640
as organizations evolve,
get bigger, more people,

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:18.510
these turn into silos.

00:28:19.614 --> 00:28:21.030
And they don't
talk to each other.

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:21.650
It's a day shift.

00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:22.390
It's a night shift.

00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:24.848
It's the people that come in
direct contact with customers,

00:28:24.848 --> 00:28:28.190
or people in back rooms
that are grinding out code.

00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:30.120
Those become islands.

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:32.060
Disneyland is no
different than that.

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:34.280
I mean, you think about
the setup of Disneyland

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:37.060
alone-- Fantasyland
is a culture.

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:40.030
Tomorrowland is a
culture unto itself.

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:42.240
Frontierland is
the Wild Wild West.

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:46.520
But one of the things
that we made clear--

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.890
and I'm guessing Google
does the same thing--

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:52.320
is you have a massively
clear set of values.

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:56.820
Despite those values,
you still have

00:28:56.820 --> 00:29:01.130
to let individuals
do things their way.

00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:05.880
And as our globe shrinks, and
we have more multicultural, more

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:10.330
multilingual teammates,
associates, clients,

00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:11.857
we have to be able
to say, what's

00:29:11.857 --> 00:29:13.440
going to be appropriate
for this group

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.606
right now, and appropriate
for that group right now?

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:20.100
What I'm showing right
now is an example of this.

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:22.280
I got to work on "Pirates
of the Caribbean,"

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:25.710
which is decidedly the coolest
culture in all of Disney,

00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:28.560
because you can actually
be rather rude to guests,

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.046
and you can get away with it.

00:29:30.046 --> 00:29:31.840
(SHOUTING) Get in the boat now!

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:34.160
(LITTLE BOY VOICE) Oh, Daddy,
isn't he a swell pirate?

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:36.210
But three hours
later, you might be

00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:39.720
over on the attraction (SINGING)
it's a small world after all,

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:42.140
and you've got to be so
nice and saccharin-- that's

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:43.640
a different culture.

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:48.090
But the culture of Disney--
to create the happiest place

00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:51.030
on earth, which I find--
correct me if I'm wrong,

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:53.760
but in some of my
research of Google--

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:55.410
"the happiest place
on Earth" is how

00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:56.930
everybody relates at Disney.

00:29:56.930 --> 00:29:59.070
Yours is "don't be evil."

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:00.850
My god, go to the
negative, why don't you?

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:06.630
Jeez, that's really scary--
anyway, our "don't be evil"

00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:09.010
is "create the happiest
place on Earth,"

00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:12.980
but so that we connect with all
these different cast members,

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:16.270
we let pirates create the
happiest place on earth

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:19.220
the way pirates would, and
the people on Small World,

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:20.510
the way Small World would.

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:24.040
So we allow a modicum
of flexibility

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:26.860
within the confines of
the overall culture.

00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:29.080
But that's the key, is
that the overall culture

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:31.770
is brutally, massively clear.

00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:33.710
It's not a moving target.

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:36.710
And I see that as a
challenge for every manager

00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:38.850
in every company,
especially newly

00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:41.230
promoted managers and
supervisors who, unfortunately,

00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:42.830
are oftentimes
promoted because they

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:47.310
are an expert on
their topic, but they

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:49.330
don't know a darn thing
about managing people.

00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:53.730
So I would encourage, if
you're a designer for new hire

00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:58.680
orientation, think about how do
you keep those newly promoted

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:00.772
people up to speed as well.

00:31:00.772 --> 00:31:01.980
Questions, comments, anybody?

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.854
You see how it leads to
different discussions

00:31:03.854 --> 00:31:05.950
when wacky questions
come up like this?

00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:06.530
Yes, please.

00:31:07.879 --> 00:31:09.420
AUDIENCE: You've
addressed quite well

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:11.211
how to find the right
people and build them

00:31:11.211 --> 00:31:12.745
up as they come on board.

00:31:12.745 --> 00:31:14.010
But sometimes in an
organization of our age,

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:15.190
we have people who are
already entrenched--

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:16.460
DOUG LIPP: Who are what?

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:18.709
AUDIENCE: Entrenched-- they've
been there for a while.

00:31:18.709 --> 00:31:20.800
Maybe they're really
good for their jobs,

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:22.600
but they're not that
great for the culture.

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:24.350
How can you, as a
team, when you're

00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:26.160
trying to build this
awesome culture,

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:28.640
work around those people,
or bring them around,

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:31.080
our maybe both, or either one?

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:32.740
What do you do
with those people?

00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:35.250
DOUG LIPP: Wow, you know,
we've rehearsed this for hours,

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:36.430
and the timing is perfect.

00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:39.524
How do you get people to
move beyond being entrenched?

00:31:39.524 --> 00:31:40.190
Excellent point.

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:42.064
You all have pieces of
paper in front of you.

00:31:42.064 --> 00:31:44.830
In fact, this piece of paper,
this beautiful color copy

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:47.050
has six key lessons.

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:49.860
These are all just part of what
I talk about in "Disney U."

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:51.700
I'm addressing just a
couple of these today.

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:54.890
What I want to do is not look
at that, but flip it over.

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:55.740
How's that?

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:59.200
Go to the backside, where it's
just a blank piece of paper.

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:01.750
And I know that a couple of you
came in with pens or pencils,

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:04.545
if you have an extra pen loan
it to the person next you who

00:32:04.545 --> 00:32:05.740
doesn't have a pen.

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:07.240
If you don't have
a pen, you're just

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.614
going to do it with your finger.

00:32:08.614 --> 00:32:10.780
But we're going to do a
writing exercise for moment,

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:12.690
and this addresses creativity.

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:14.400
This addresses leadership.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.300
This addresses
getting out of a rut.

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:17.130
Everybody have a
pen in your hand?

00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:18.046
Hold it up in the air.

00:32:18.046 --> 00:32:19.090
Hold it up in the air.

00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:21.220
All right, loosen up
that wrist a little bit.

00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:23.410
I don't want anybody to
get carpal tunnel syndrome

00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:25.350
or repetitive motion injury.

00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:26.840
All right, that's good.

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:28.340
What I'm going to
have you do-- I'll

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:29.860
give you a
five-second countdown.

00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:34.570
And I'm going to have you
sign your name as many times

00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:35.430
as you can.

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:38.420
For a warm up, sign your
name one time right now

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:39.990
on that piece of
paper-- just one.

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:41.960
Sign it.

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:42.530
You got it?

00:32:43.456 --> 00:32:44.330
You're looking at it.

00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:45.000
You're smiling.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:45.670
Everybody does that.

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:47.045
They look at their
name, and they

00:32:47.045 --> 00:32:49.510
smile, because we've all
practiced that signature

00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:51.070
since we were in fourth grade.

00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:52.970
And we love our signature.

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:55.634
Now, five seconds, and after
that five seconds what you're

00:32:55.634 --> 00:32:57.300
going to do, is you're
going to continue

00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:58.890
to sign your name
as many times as you

00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:00.970
can nonstop for 30 seconds.

00:33:00.970 --> 00:33:03.180
I will keep track
of the time-- five,

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:06.870
four, three, two, one, begin.

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:10.030
30 seconds nonstop-- sign your
name as many times as you can.

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:13.080
You've gone 15 seconds.

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.580
You're probably
cramping up already.

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:15.110
That's OK.

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:16.230
Push through the pain.

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:18.719
10 seconds, keep going.

00:33:18.719 --> 00:33:20.010
All right, shake out that hand.

00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:20.926
Get rid of the cramps.

00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:25.360
Now analyze your
handwriting two ways.

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:28.020
One, do a productivity
assessment-- how many times

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:29.622
did you actually sign your name?

00:33:29.622 --> 00:33:30.580
Write that number down.

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:31.490
Don't look at your neighbor.

00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:33.120
It doesn't matter
if you did more.

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:35.280
You are such a type
a competitive group.

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:36.204
Just relax .

00:33:36.204 --> 00:33:38.370
Their name might have more
letters in it than yours.

00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:40.210
So do a productivity
assessment--

00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:42.150
how many times did
you sign your name?

00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:44.680
Then I want to do a
quality assessment,

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:46.430
using a 1 through 10 scale.

00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:49.160
10 is perfect-- oh
my gosh, that's mine.

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:51.960
1 is who wrote this
chicken scratch?

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:52.714
10 is great.

00:33:52.714 --> 00:33:53.380
One is terrible.

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:55.440
Or something in
between for a quality

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:56.610
score-- purely subjective.

00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:58.590
You all have that?

00:33:58.590 --> 00:33:58.900
Look at me.

00:33:58.900 --> 00:33:59.608
Give me feedback.

00:33:59.608 --> 00:34:01.050
This is yes.

00:34:01.050 --> 00:34:05.050
This is no, and this is
what is this guy doing?

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:08.424
Now, with pen in dominant
hand, hold that in the air,

00:34:08.424 --> 00:34:10.590
or if you did air writing,
just hold your blank hand

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:11.230
in the air.

00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:12.889
Keep that hand in the air.

00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:14.600
Raise your non-dominant hand.

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:15.730
Both hands are in the air.

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:18.699
Transfer the pen to
the non-dominant hand.

00:34:18.699 --> 00:34:19.780
Hands down.

00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:25.410
Five, four, three, two, one,
proceed-- same exercise,

00:34:25.410 --> 00:34:26.659
30 seconds with your off-hand.

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:30.855
No laughing-- this is a
very important exercise.

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:37.820
Stop writing.

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:38.550
Do me a favor.

00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:40.591
Look at your neighbor's
and laugh uncontrollably.

00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:49.889
Do a productivity assessment.

00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:51.530
How many times did
you sign your name

00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:53.070
with your non-dominant hand?

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:54.179
Write that number down.

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:58.107
Next is that quality
score, and this

00:34:58.107 --> 00:34:59.940
is how you're going to
get it-- this 1 to 10

00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:01.890
scale-- look at
your dominant hand

00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:03.740
as the benchmark of excellence.

00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:05.230
That's the perfect model.

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:08.860
Compare and contrast-- if your
non-dominant hand looks exactly

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:11.600
like that, give yourself
a 10 for quality.

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:13.960
Otherwise, drop it down the
scale accordingly-- five,

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.930
three, one, zero,
minus 1 million--

00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:17.660
whatever you think you deserve.

00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:18.920
Take a couple seconds.

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:20.490
Get that down.

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:23.052
Three questions-- please,
raise your hands in response.

00:35:23.052 --> 00:35:24.760
Everybody, I want you
to respond to this.

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:27.030
How many saw a drop-off
in your productivity

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:28.112
the second time around?

00:35:28.112 --> 00:35:28.820
Raise your hands.

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:30.760
Look around the room--
beautiful-- hands down.

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:32.900
How many saw a
drop-off in quality

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:35.160
the second go around--
beautiful, hands down.

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:38.590
Last question, how many felt
uncomfortable or downright

00:35:38.590 --> 00:35:41.280
foolish the second go
around-- beautiful.

00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:44.290
That's the answer
to your question.

00:35:44.290 --> 00:35:46.984
We get stuck in ruts because
we don't want to look stupid.

00:35:46.984 --> 00:35:47.900
We don't want to fail.

00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:52.250
Metaphorically, as
a coach of others--

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:55.800
even when working with clientele
in sales and services--

00:35:55.800 --> 00:36:00.040
I, as a change-agent,
need to recognize the pain

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:01.740
I'm putting through
that changee.

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:06.970
Even myself-- I am not
comfortable looking foolish.

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:08.810
I don't know how to
manage people that way.

00:36:08.810 --> 00:36:10.960
But I'm not going to let
on that I don't know.

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:16.100
We all have egos-- individually,
as well as organizationally.

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:17.660
And metaphorically,
the challenge

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:20.960
is are you willing and able
to move the pen from one hand

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:21.610
to the other?

00:36:21.610 --> 00:36:24.290
It doesn't mean that you're
giving up that dominant hand

00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:25.270
and skill set.

00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:26.829
It means that
you're adding to it.

00:36:26.829 --> 00:36:28.620
And the reason I feel
strongly about this--

00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:30.820
and I'm going to talk about
it as we go along here--

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:35.310
is that we at Disney became
so confident and competent

00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:38.840
with our dominant hand,
that we forgot to change.

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:42.840
You think left and
right, dominant hand

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:45.750
or non-dominant hand, now
let's change it to people.

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:50.880
Dreamers and doers represent
the far ends of that continuum.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:53.345
Continuum is what we in
the OD business call it.

00:36:53.345 --> 00:36:56.130
It's just a, line for crying
out loud, but it's a line,

00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:58.220
and on the far end what
we're showing up on

00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:01.116
the screen now is Walt
was on the dreamer

00:37:01.116 --> 00:37:01.990
end of the continuum.

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:03.760
What if?

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:05.140
What are we going to do?

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:07.360
It's Google X, right?

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:09.924
And you have to make
things go to market.

00:37:09.924 --> 00:37:10.840
You got to make money.

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:12.290
You got to make
it happen somehow.

00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:14.030
You got to produce this thing.

00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:15.680
So you have to have doers.

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:19.370
Walt Disney and his brother
Roy were the classic balance

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:20.490
of dreamer, doer.

00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:22.660
You don't agree with
everything they say.

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:25.410
But at least you have
that contrarian thinker.

00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:29.600
Teams that have both
are amazingly strong.

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:32.980
But unfortunately, only about
7% of companies around the world

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:35.360
have a succession plan.

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:38.050
And we at Disney
fell into that trap.

00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:40.610
With both dreamers and
doers on your team--

00:37:40.610 --> 00:37:42.610
regardless of how old
they are or how many years

00:37:42.610 --> 00:37:44.680
of experience--
you will continue

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:45.780
to dominate your market.

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:49.010
You will continue to have
a culture that evolves,

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:50.280
challenges itself.

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:52.829
But with one, you're done.

00:37:52.829 --> 00:37:54.620
So I want to share with
you a quote, again,

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:56.590
from this gentleman
Marty Sklar that

00:37:56.590 --> 00:38:01.370
spent 53 years in his career
with the Disney organization,

00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:04.940
and he talked about the
mindset that Walt Disney had.

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:08.060
Walt Disney in, Marty's words,
as I'm showing on the screen,

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:10.940
"always had one foot in the past
and one foot in the future."

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:14.650
He recognized the importance
of the legacy of the company.

00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:16.850
And legacy is a relative
term-- for some companies

00:38:16.850 --> 00:38:19.930
it's 16 years, for some
companies it's decades,

00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:21.990
for some it's just
a couple of years.

00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:24.540
In Silicon Valley, a long legacy
is a day, and you're done.

00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:25.180
It's OK.

00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:28.202
But he, meaning Walt,
didn't hang out in the past.

00:38:28.202 --> 00:38:29.910
He knew that it was
important to leverage

00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:32.170
that to go to the future
and upset the apple

00:38:32.170 --> 00:38:34.570
cart, constantly moving
the pen, metaphorically,

00:38:34.570 --> 00:38:35.840
left to right, right to left.

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:38.260
But when Walt passed
away, the tendency

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:42.060
was for the doer
mindset to take over--

00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:45.100
not upset the apple cart,
not make any mistakes,

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:46.940
keep the pen in
that dominant hand.

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:51.839
Another way to look at it is
something called the "S curve."

00:38:51.839 --> 00:38:53.380
Has anybody ever
studied the S curve?

00:38:54.874 --> 00:38:56.040
You might want to Google it.

00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:56.800
Check it out.

00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:59.240
But it's also known
as the sigmoid curve.

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:01.010
Now if you've had
a sigmoidoscopy,

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:02.640
you don't want to
think about that.

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:04.310
So we'll just call the S curve.

00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:07.660
But it's basically the letter
"S" kind of lying on its side.

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:11.010
And it basically represents
the beginning, middle, and end.

00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:14.410
It's a life cycle of
anything-- an idea, a product,

00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:17.670
a color scheme, hairstyles,
whatever the case might be.

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:20.490
And if you have dreamers
and doers on a team,

00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:23.530
then you're guaranteed of
having multiple S curves going

00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:27.420
in the air, and many things
being juggled at the same time.

00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:29.480
If you only have
one or the other,

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:32.150
generally, the marketplace
has changed around you,

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:36.100
and you didn't realize it,
or you're producing products

00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:37.790
that nobody cares about anymore.

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:40.360
And most organizations
don't change

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:43.750
until they get to point
z, and that's too late.

00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:46.640
And this is exactly what
happened to us at Disney.

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:48.290
When Walt Disney
passed away, and we

00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:50.900
lost that creative
force, and the person who

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:53.370
was willing and able to
upset the apple cart,

00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:55.930
and everybody was busy
circling wagons to make sure

00:39:55.930 --> 00:39:58.110
that nothing changed,
we got in trouble.

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:01.620
So I want to think about--
this quote right now,

00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:04.267
I think, is particularly
poignant for Google.

00:40:04.267 --> 00:40:06.100
You're at your 10th
anniversary of your IPO.

00:40:07.170 --> 00:40:09.650
This quote is from Walt
Disney at the 10th anniversary

00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:10.840
of Disneyland.

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:12.140
Disneyland opened in '55.

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:14.860
This is from a meeting that
he had with his executive team

00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:18.340
and operations team in 1965.

00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:20.100
And of many things
that he said, he said,

00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:22.770
we've had 10 years of
knock-the-ball-out-of-the-park

00:40:22.770 --> 00:40:23.330
success.

00:40:23.330 --> 00:40:24.990
And he talked about
all the accolades

00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:28.170
from around the world of
starting this theme park called

00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:30.404
Disneyland that no one had
ever dreamed of before.

00:40:30.404 --> 00:40:32.570
In the past, it was you
should go to the state fair.

00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:33.850
Or you go to a county fair.

00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:36.170
And you know what kind
of quality you get there.

00:40:37.156 --> 00:40:38.530
And Walt said,
but you know what?

00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:42.520
I look at these first
10 years as nothing more

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:47.060
than a dress rehearsal-- nothing
more than a dress rehearsal.

00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:48.710
And if any of you
on this team think

00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:52.090
you can rest on your laurels,
then there's the door.

00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:55.570
That's what keeps an
organization young and dynamic,

00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:58.040
is you've always got
that pressure to perform.

00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:00.580
And you can look at
that as massive stress.

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:03.320
Or you could look at as
tremendous opportunity.

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:08.030
And when Walt passed away, some
of that went away with him.

00:41:11.570 --> 00:41:14.080
Another thing that
went away with him--

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:17.300
and this is another part about
keeping an organizational

00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:20.720
culture alive and well-- is
a term that we use a Disney

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:23.490
called "plussing the
show"-- improving the show.

00:41:23.490 --> 00:41:25.000
I'll give you one
specific example

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.380
that I write about
in "Disney U."

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:28.820
One of the directors of
the Disney University

00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:31.270
told me a story about when
he was an 18-year-old ride

00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:32.630
operator at Disneyland.

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:34.820
And Walt Disney came into
the park all the time.

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:36.680
Walt was known to walk the park.

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:40.970
He was always in direct contact
with guests and cast members.

00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:43.240
Walt Disney rode
on jungle cruise?

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:45.100
Anybody ever ridden on
Jungle Cruise before?

00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:46.450
Fantastic ride.

00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:49.400
And Walt gone off of the boat--
there are seven boats on jungle

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:52.040
cruise-- he got off of the boat
and pulled all the skippers off

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:53.540
to the side on the
dock to give them

00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:55.100
some fairly critical feedback.

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:57.770
He said, we've got
to plus the show.

00:41:57.770 --> 00:41:59.999
If we don't plus the
show we'll lose guests,

00:41:59.999 --> 00:42:01.790
and it will take us
years to get them back.

00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:04.440
And this is the specific
example he gave-- he said,

00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:05.860
we've invested
millions of dollars

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:08.010
in this attraction--
in the soundtrack,

00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:10.660
in the audio
animatronic figures.

00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:14.000
And he said, and each of
you skippers undermine that.

00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:17.470
And this guy said, well,
what do we do, Walt?

00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:18.930
He said, well, you
think about it.

00:42:18.930 --> 00:42:20.702
In this seven-minute
ride, when we

00:42:20.702 --> 00:42:22.160
get to about the
middle of the ride

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:25.570
where the jungle is
encroaching on us,

00:42:25.570 --> 00:42:28.070
and the boats are getting into
that real, dark scary part

00:42:28.070 --> 00:42:30.880
of the jungle, and the river
is really dark, dark green,

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:32.430
what happens at
that moment, when

00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:34.394
everybody's on pins and needles?

00:42:34.394 --> 00:42:37.060
And the skippers all said, well,
that's when the hippos jump out

00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:39.150
of the water-- the hippopotamus.

00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:40.310
And Walt said, exactly.

00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:41.990
And what do those hippos do?

00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.940
Well, they roar.

00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:43.800
And they scream.

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:45.580
And they spit water.

00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:48.287
He said, yes, and they
spit water on the guests,

00:42:48.287 --> 00:42:49.120
and they make noise.

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:51.170
And what are the
guests are doing?

00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:53.360
Well, they're screaming
with delight and fright.

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:55.540
Exactly, said Walt.

00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:57.790
What were each of
you skippers doing?

00:42:57.790 --> 00:42:59.730
And then Walt
demonstrated to them--

00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:06.160
this is driving a boat-- [YAWNS]
another day, another hippo.

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:08.510
You killed the show.

00:43:10.770 --> 00:43:12.985
You've got a week to
practice looking surprised.

00:43:14.662 --> 00:43:16.370
And this guy that I
interviewed, he said,

00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:18.010
and you can only
imagine how many hours

00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:20.940
we spent the next week
practicing looking surprised,

00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:23.120
knowing full well that
Walt was going to be back.

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:26.440
And he said, but what was
interesting about this process,

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:29.240
was that at first it was just
pretending to look surprised.

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:31.340
But then, as we did
it more and more,

00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:35.480
we realized this is a brand
new boatload of guests,

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:37.470
and for then this is a
brand new experience.

00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:39.555
And we started to
feel their excitement.

00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:41.940
So here is Walt Disney, again.

00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:44.730
This brilliant man who
said, millions of dollars

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:47.920
invested in the hardware,
but you're the software.

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:49.910
How much does a smile cost?

00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:51.805
That keeps an
organization fresh,

00:43:51.805 --> 00:43:53.770
and it's an example
of plussing the show.

00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:58.215
It means that we
all make mistakes.

00:43:58.215 --> 00:44:00.590
This artwork is from another
book that I wrote years ago.

00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:02.423
It's from a proverb
that I learned in Japan.

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:06.830
And the proverb is this--
even monkeys fall from trees.

00:44:06.830 --> 00:44:10.320
No matter how good you are, no
matter your name recognition--

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:12.010
domestically or
internationally--

00:44:12.010 --> 00:44:14.190
you will screw up.

00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:16.750
And all too often, organizations
and individual managers

00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:20.474
blame that metaphorical gust
of wind, or the broken branch,

00:44:20.474 --> 00:44:22.390
for the reason they're
flat on their backside,

00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:25.300
as opposed to looking in
the mirror and assessing

00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:26.790
how they could improve.

00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:30.460
So here is something I'd
like to share with you,

00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:32.680
and then I'm going to start
to bring this to a close.

00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:36.020
This is a picture of that
wonderful, beautiful man,

00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:36.610
Van France.

00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:40.790
This is the guy that created
the Disney University.

00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:42.650
How many of you been
to the Disney Institute

00:44:42.650 --> 00:44:44.080
with the B.A. Program?

00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:44.640
Some of you?

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:46.990
I heard that quite a few,
actually, at Google do.

00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:49.630
The Disney Institute is
the for-public version

00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:52.910
of the university,
which Van started.

00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:57.780
So this set of words is part
of a memo than Van France sent

00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:00.180
to Walt Disney and something
called the Park Operating

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:04.420
Committee to challenge
them on being more creative

00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:09.330
in being better leaders,
creating better training,

00:45:09.330 --> 00:45:10.700
keeping the product fresh.

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:13.820
Look at the word choice in here.

00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:16.430
Has anybody ever used
the word "arthritis

00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:21.030
of the imagination," or
"cirrhosis of the enthusiasm"?

00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:23.370
And this is the
brilliance of Van France--

00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:27.570
just like Walt Disney-- really,
really honest, brutally honest,

00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:29.290
and a great salesperson.

00:45:29.290 --> 00:45:31.850
He knew that if he
didn't package a memo

00:45:31.850 --> 00:45:35.316
in a creative enough way, that
Walt and the team of executives

00:45:35.316 --> 00:45:36.690
wouldn't pay any
attention to it.

00:45:37.830 --> 00:45:39.770
So my question to
you is this, who

00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:44.200
is the Van France on your team,
within sales and services?

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:45.910
Who is the person
who's not afraid to say

00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:46.900
what he or she sees?

00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:50.260
Now, I understand in any
organization there's always

00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:53.710
going to be politics involved,
but people like Van France

00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:56.340
always find ways to get the
truth to the right people.

00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:01.880
So I'm going to finish up
with another little exercise,

00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:04.190
just to have you get
a little bit of energy

00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:07.120
before you got to go back
out into the Bay area traffic

00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:08.274
and drive home.

00:46:08.274 --> 00:46:09.690
I want you think
about creativity.

00:46:11.830 --> 00:46:14.340
Something as simple as
"how clean is clean?"

00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:16.120
Before we opened
Tokyo Disneyland,

00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:19.832
the team of custodians
that I hired and trained

00:46:19.832 --> 00:46:20.665
made a huge mistake.

00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:26.124
The night before our
first mini-grand opening,

00:46:26.124 --> 00:46:27.790
we had executives
from the United States

00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:29.950
tell them, hey, go out
tonight, and clean the park,

00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:32.460
because Disney is
known for cleanliness.

00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:35.870
And we had spent months training
them on cleaning the park.

00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:37.620
And it was all interpreted
perfectly well.

00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:38.780
And so they said,
yes, we understand.

00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:40.170
We're going to clean the park.

00:46:40.170 --> 00:46:43.640
This is the graveyard crew--
midnight, 3 o'clock, 4 o'clock,

00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:44.884
everything goes fine.

00:46:44.884 --> 00:46:46.550
4 o'clock in morning,
I get a phone call

00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:48.500
from a very upset
American executive.

00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:51.840
What is wrong with those
custodians you hired

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:52.960
and you trained?

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:55.260
And I said, nothing-- we
hired the best custodians

00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:56.672
from around the country.

00:46:56.672 --> 00:46:58.130
He said, well, then
answer me this,

00:46:58.130 --> 00:47:00.225
why did they clean
The Haunted Mansion?

00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:04.417
I said, what's the problem?

00:47:04.417 --> 00:47:05.500
It's supposed to be clean.

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:07.490
He says, no, no,
you don't get it.

00:47:07.490 --> 00:47:09.140
They fixed all the
broken windows.

00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:11.630
They vacuumed up all the dust.

00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:13.370
All the spider webs are gone.

00:47:13.370 --> 00:47:15.270
Literally in about
four hours, they

00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:19.210
had cleaned away a quarter
million dollars of artwork.

00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:21.290
It no longer looked
spooky and scary.

00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:23.450
It looked like an
operating room.

00:47:23.450 --> 00:47:26.150
And the trouble was this-- and
we did a root cause analysis--

00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:30.090
it's because we trained them
in backstage areas that weren't

00:47:30.090 --> 00:47:34.750
aged and grained-- kitchens,
restrooms, break areas that

00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:36.584
had a lot of stainless
steel and white tile.

00:47:36.584 --> 00:47:38.458
And when they would
scrub it until it shined,

00:47:38.458 --> 00:47:39.850
we would say, bravo, good job!

00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:44.280
And they took that same approach
into The Haunted Mansion.

00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:47.320
So again, communication
is not easy.

00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:49.230
And as our teams
get more diverse,

00:47:49.230 --> 00:47:52.650
based on age,
ethnicity, culture,

00:47:52.650 --> 00:47:54.557
it gets even more complicated.

00:47:54.557 --> 00:47:56.390
So I'm going to finish
this with that story.

00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:57.790
It's written about

I want to thank you all
so much for your time.

00:48:00.110 --> 00:48:02.180
I know but you've got
very, very busy schedules.

00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:04.510
Keep up the good work
and keep your culture

00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:06.480
alive and well
and ever-evolving.

00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:08.510
Thank you so much.
