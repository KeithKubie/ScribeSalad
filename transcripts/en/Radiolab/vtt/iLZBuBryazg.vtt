00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.120
Hey, I'm Chad. I've been rod. I'm Robert Krulwich.

2
00:00:03.121 --> 00:00:05.610
This is radio lab and today we are, um,

3
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.500
we're celebrating and a multiple set of anniversaries because it was 80 years

4
00:00:10.501 --> 00:00:11.940
ago, 80 years ago,

5
00:00:11.941 --> 00:00:16.941
that Orson wells and the mercury theater decided to allow Martians to invade the

6
00:00:18.391 --> 00:00:19.710
State of New Jersey.

7
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.750
It's one of the most famous broadcasts in broadcast history because it freaked

8
00:00:24.751 --> 00:00:26.250
people out. Yes.

9
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.960
<v 1>And then, uh, merely 10 years ago, uh,</v>

10
00:00:28.961 --> 00:00:33.280
we decided to take another look at this broadcast,

11
00:00:33.281 --> 00:00:38.281
which has gotten very complicated and layered and disputed in some ways over

12
00:00:38.501 --> 00:00:38.980
time.

13
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.220
<v 0>We're now celebrating our 10th. They're celebrating their 80th.</v>

14
00:00:42.221 --> 00:00:45.640
So along with Orson Wells, who am I afraid couldn't be here tonight,

15
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.820
leaving the rest in peace. Yes.

16
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.780
We would like to present our homage to a,

17
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.120
I guess two microbes really to the little earthlings that saved the planet,

18
00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.690
right? So

19
00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.440
<v 1>in honor of the microbes in honor of a war of the worlds which broadcast 80</v>

20
00:01:02.441 --> 00:01:04.600
years ago, a today, tonight,

21
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.660
here is our take on war of the worlds.

22
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.073
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

23
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.140
<v 3>October 30th, 1938 on that night,</v>

24
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.300
the United States experienced the kind of mass hysteria that we'd never seen

25
00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:25.224
before.

26
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.570
And the reason which today is sounds almost comical was a radio play.

27
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200
<v 2>Really.</v>

28
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.820
I did say to him with an orphan wells and the mercury Federer on the air and the

29
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.983
war of the world,

30
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.730
[inaudible]

31
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.820
<v 3>around 12 million people were listening. Most got the joke.</v>

32
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.380
It was Halloween after all.

33
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.120
But if you consider that about one out of every 12 people didn't get the joke.

34
00:01:51.121 --> 00:01:55.170
That's what surveys found afterwards about one out of every 12 people who heard

35
00:01:55.171 --> 00:01:56.700
the broadcast thought it was true,

36
00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.650
and that some percentage that 1 million people ran out of their homes,

37
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.690
towels over their faces, clutching children, tripping, breaking limbs. Well,

38
00:02:06.691 --> 00:02:09.810
that constitutes a major freak out.

39
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:11.430
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

40
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.670
<v 3>and then this is our first ever live hour on radio lab here at Saint Paul,</v>

41
00:02:15.671 --> 00:02:18.760
Minnesota at the Fitzgerald Theater. We ask why,

42
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.080
<v 2>why did people panic?</v>

43
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.750
<v 0>And of course we'll ask the big question as well, which is Canon happen again.</v>

44
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.140
<v 3>I'm Jad Abumrad thank you all for coming in.</v>

45
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.750
<v 2>Where's my [inaudible]?</v>

46
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.010
So let me [inaudible] I mean,

47
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.660
<v 0>let me just say at the outset,</v>

48
00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:44.060
I'm just a tiny bit of puzzle before you do we just tell it,

49
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.760
tell everyone who you are. Yeah, I'm Robert. Can you just say Robert Crow,

50
00:02:46.761 --> 00:02:49.730
which is my name and uh, with all due respect,

51
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.070
I mean if we had any number of things we could have done in the hour,

52
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.310
could've done sex, lives of watermelon.

53
00:02:55.311 --> 00:02:56.840
Something interesting about chrysanthemums.

54
00:02:56.841 --> 00:03:00.490
I don't know why choose a Martian invasion radio

55
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.990
<v 1>show from 1938 old old, old gay,</v>

56
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.840
well I guess it's a valid question you ask. Truth is,

57
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.020
I actually only discovered the war of the worlds recently in 2001 actually not

58
00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:19.081
long after that day in 2001 and it just really struck me and it wasn't so much

59
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.960
that the broadcast had a kind of end of the world notice that I guess we were

60
00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:27.520
all feeling in real life at that moment,

61
00:03:27.521 --> 00:03:32.521
but it was more just the way that the story unfolded step by step by step and

62
00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:38.830
how in the broadcast you feel like you were lost inside a newscast,

63
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.280
which is not unlike what it was like we were all, you know,

64
00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:45.280
glued to the TV in real life, grasping at these pieces of news,

65
00:03:45.281 --> 00:03:48.280
trying to figure out what was going on. And that was very much,

66
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.700
I think what they were trying to create in the broadcast. But now,

67
00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:55.450
many years later, what I'm really left with is a question, what?

68
00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.891
Well,

69
00:03:56.891 --> 00:04:01.891
if I were alive in 1938 in front of the radio and I heard this sounds,

70
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.310
what would I have thought? Would I have believed it? I mean, I don't know.

71
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.160
What about you? I don't really know. I don't really know. Okay,

72
00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.270
well let's do something. Let's actually go back to 1938 and, uh,

73
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.450
see if we can figure out how these sounds landed on people's ears and what

74
00:04:16.451 --> 00:04:19.330
information they had in their heads. So, and I need your help with this.

75
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.500
How would I help with that? Yeah. You,

76
00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.460
I want you to go over to that seat right there. That's,

77
00:04:24.461 --> 00:04:29.010
we're going to call that seat in 1938 all right there. Okay.

78
00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.940
Now just, let's just all imagine there you are on your easy chair.

79
00:04:33.941 --> 00:04:36.520
You're maybe drinking a cream soda.

80
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.240
Let's tune the dial. Okay.

81
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.570
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

82
00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.370
<v 1>okay, I've got something on the dial.</v>

83
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.821
<v 5>Good evening,</v>

84
00:04:49.821 --> 00:04:53.300
ladies and gentlemen from the Meridian Room in the Park Plaza Hotel in New York.

85
00:04:53.301 --> 00:04:56.030
Today we bring you the music of Raman [inaudible] and his orchestra.

86
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.520
<v 1>Who is Rick Marge, you know, a Raymond ruck. Hello.</v>

87
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.080
<v 5>The doctors, the Spanish Raymar [inaudible] with lower cupboard.</v>

88
00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.453
<v 4>Nope.</v>

89
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.170
<v 1>You don't know that there's no such person as Ramon Rick, hello. And Net.</v>

90
00:05:11.171 --> 00:05:14.140
It's just a record and a CBS studio, but it sounds professional enough.

91
00:05:14.141 --> 00:05:16.720
So you sit back, you relax. But then

92
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:17.660
<v 5>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

93
00:05:17.661 --> 00:05:21.870
we interrupt our program of dance music to bring you a special bulletin from the

94
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.620
Intercontinental Radio on you at 20 minutes before eight central time,

95
00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.650
refactor Pharrell at the mouth, getting the observatory reports,

96
00:05:27.651 --> 00:05:29.120
observing several explosions,

97
00:05:29.121 --> 00:05:33.080
but then can definitely get occurring at regular intervals on the planet Mars.

98
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.190
The spectroscope indicates the gas will be hydrogen and moving toward the earth

99
00:05:37.191 --> 00:05:38.240
with enormous velocity,

100
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.520
not returning you to the music of Ramrod Kilo playing for you in the Meridian

101
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.430
Room of the Park Plaza Hotel situated in downtown New York.

102
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.890
<v 4>[inaudible].</v>

103
00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:56.450
<v 1>So at this point you think I'm thinking explosions on Mars,</v>

104
00:05:56.451 --> 00:05:58.190
hydrogen moving towards earth.

105
00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:58.821
<v 0>A little strange,</v>

106
00:05:58.821 --> 00:06:03.080
but how could it be so bad if I still get to listen to the fabulous nodes of the

107
00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:04.790
lovely Raymond? You go to that color

108
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.300
<v 1>and he does continue to play for another minute, 34 seconds.</v>

109
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.250
But then it happens again.

110
00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.190
<v 5>Ladies and gentlemen, following on the newest,</v>

111
00:06:12.191 --> 00:06:13.670
given an iron bullet in the moment ago,

112
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.690
the government media or logical bureau has requested the Lord.

113
00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.580
<v 1>Now before we go ahead and leave it there for, are we going to get further?</v>

114
00:06:21.581 --> 00:06:24.790
Let me ask a really basic question here. I mean, we're dealing with a play,

115
00:06:24.791 --> 00:06:26.260
a radio play. Yeah.

116
00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.400
Why would Orson wells in his posse of have troubadours start their play this

117
00:06:30.401 --> 00:06:31.080
way?

118
00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.010
<v 0>The original,</v>

119
00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:37.340
each Gul story was written in 1898 so it was really an old book at the time and

120
00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.680
there, there is no reporter character in the book. By the way,

121
00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.710
does everybody know this word? The world story. And most people do.

122
00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.830
The story basically is this little green creatures from Mars for a number of

123
00:06:46.831 --> 00:06:48.360
reasons having to do with thirst or something,

124
00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:53.160
have to leave their planet and they come to Earth. They're not very nice people.

125
00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:57.180
They invade, they destroy quite a number of us.

126
00:06:57.181 --> 00:07:01.410
And then ironically in the end they get killed by little viruses,

127
00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.410
our smallest inhabitants of our planet, bite them and destroy them.

128
00:07:04.411 --> 00:07:08.610
And it's science fiction of course. But in 1938 most kids knew this story.

129
00:07:08.611 --> 00:07:10.800
It was very popular. So I don't see why.

130
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:11.930
<v 1>Right. And in fact,</v>

131
00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:15.320
let me bring in a clip from a Orson wells producer at the time, John Houseman,

132
00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.460
<v 5>uh, Austin and I chose it. We decided the time had come,</v>

133
00:07:19.461 --> 00:07:24.320
we should be doing a science fiction show. And so we tried a few of that one.

134
00:07:24.321 --> 00:07:25.250
Very easy to do.

135
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.550
<v 1>Just a few days before they had to be on the air with their next installment.</v>

136
00:07:28.551 --> 00:07:32.840
John Houseman pulls that book off the shelf to shows it to o w says, Hey,

137
00:07:32.841 --> 00:07:36.590
what about this? And Orson Welles says this,

138
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.760
you want me to do this? Oh, he, uh, had trouble in what sense? In the sentence?

139
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:46.340
<v 5>No, he said he was barring, uh, if it was something that happened 50 years ago,</v>

140
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:50.310
everybody knows it didn't happen. So, uh, who the hell cares,

141
00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.273
<v 1>right?</v>

142
00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:58.730
We're gonna make people care about this old story. We've got updated not 18, 98,

143
00:07:58.731 --> 00:08:02.840
1938. And it just so happened that one month prior,

144
00:08:02.841 --> 00:08:07.841
something had happened that forever changed the world in the news.

145
00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.680
What was that? We'll begin with the story.

146
00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:15.180
<v 5>The trains go by dies. [inaudible] I bought it.</v>

147
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:18.480
[inaudible]

148
00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.850
<v 1>Hitler was threatened in Europe, first Austria,</v>

149
00:08:20.851 --> 00:08:25.320
then Czechoslovakia World War Two was right around the corner and cvs sent a

150
00:08:25.321 --> 00:08:28.360
team of guys to cover this story among them, Edward, right

151
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:31.590
<v 5>where Allambia continues with expensive coverage of a European car.</v>

152
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:36.570
<v 1>And in September Moreau and his CBS producers did something with the news that</v>

153
00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:39.920
was kind of novel. The broke in.

154
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:43.530
<v 6>We interrupt this program of music by Harry James and his orchestra to bring you</v>

155
00:08:43.531 --> 00:08:46.050
a bullet in just received. And that w o r knew his role.

156
00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.970
<v 1>No, this had happened before, but never quite like this with life reports,</v>

157
00:08:49.971 --> 00:08:52.370
eye witness accounts and never quite so much

158
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:55.690
<v 6>where up their broadcast to bring it up in Portland, probably night of prep</v>

159
00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.290
<v 5>and just one month. These buildings have become so numerous.</v>

160
00:08:58.291 --> 00:09:00.720
We interrupt our program to bring you a special broadcast.

161
00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:03.470
That bulletins were practically interrupting bulletins.

162
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:05.560
We interrupted the program to bring you a special broad,

163
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:08.440
<v 2>let me interrupt this broadcast to bring her this in parking bulletin from the</v>

164
00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:09.810
United Bread

165
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:13.400
<v 5>program to take it in the NBC News Room [inaudible] on the NBC.</v>

166
00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:16.340
<v 1>So after weeks and weeks of hearing these constant interruptions,</v>

167
00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:19.170
it's easy to understand why this play. [inaudible]

168
00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:21.110
<v 5>the gentlemen following on the news, given an off,</v>

169
00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:23.660
we'll live in the moment of goal, didn't sound like a play,

170
00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:27.530
but Gavin loved meteorological bureau has requested the large observatories of

171
00:09:27.531 --> 00:09:31.790
the country to keep on Astronomical Watch on any further disturbances occurring

172
00:09:31.791 --> 00:09:35.270
on the planet Mars. We have arranged an interview with a noted astronomer,

173
00:09:35.271 --> 00:09:36.270
professor Pierson,

174
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.040
who will give out his views on this event and a few moments we will take you to

175
00:09:40.041 --> 00:09:42.290
the principal observatory at Princeton, New Jersey.

176
00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:46.010
We return you until then for the meal take of Grandma and rock yellow and the

177
00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:46.993
door.

178
00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:50.800
<v 2>I don't know whether I need anymore. Raymond. Marcelo,</v>

179
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:53.280
I need to know a little more about this motion. Uh,

180
00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:57.730
<v 1>isn't it interesting how slowly it starts and by the way, um,</v>

181
00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:01.390
what time do you got on your, uh, your a pocketwatch there? Uh,

182
00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:05.860
the pocket watch says eight Oh four eight oh four.

183
00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:10.600
Tell me when it gets the eight oh five to what? Eight oh five to eight.

184
00:10:10.601 --> 00:10:12.040
Oh five. Eight oh five

185
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:15.610
and no,

186
00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:20.760
this is my favorite minute in understanding one of the greatest media hoaxes of

187
00:10:21.221 --> 00:10:24.660
all times. Cause it's the thing that's interesting is that at this moment in uh,

188
00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:26.110
October of 1938 art,

189
00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:29.800
Orson wells in the mercury theater of the air were not that popular.

190
00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:33.940
They had a tiny, tiny slice of the audience.

191
00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:37.750
And so not too many people were listening. Certainly not at the beginning.

192
00:10:37.751 --> 00:10:39.490
From eight o'clock to eight Oh four.

193
00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:43.960
And so not too many people heard this very important introduction,

194
00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:47.240
<v 5>the Columbia Broadcasting System and its affiliated stations.</v>

195
00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:49.850
Was that the war of the world by h g [inaudible]

196
00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:53.320
<v 1>what? Wait. Why didn't they hear that? Well cause at that very same moment,</v>

197
00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:56.530
the majority of people listening were tuned into this.

198
00:10:56.610 --> 00:11:00.030
<v 5>The bakers of Jason Sanborn copied his super gland, you know,</v>

199
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:02.460
is fresh present the chase and Sanborn out

200
00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:07.280
<v 2>that chase and sandbar now, now that that was good. That was Ed Bergen.</v>

201
00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:11.390
It had the puppet, Charlie McCarthy Mu who liked girls.

202
00:11:11.391 --> 00:11:14.030
It was as high as it's rated. It was the most popular show at the time.

203
00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:14.960
Right opposite.

204
00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.280
<v 1>Agreed Theater of the year had 10 times the audience,</v>

205
00:11:17.281 --> 00:11:22.281
but at eight oh five host Donna Meechie introduces not so popular singer

206
00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:28.990
<v 5>and it's the rousing rip roaring song of vagabonds from La Vagabond. Jake.</v>

207
00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:34.040
<v 2>Aw, yours mega love raffle up</v>

208
00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:38.640
and yes, at that moment thousands, hundreds.

209
00:11:38.641 --> 00:11:41.100
We don't know how many listeners started to dial surf

210
00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:51.290
<v 1>where they landed on the mercury theater of the air already in progress where</v>

211
00:11:51.291 --> 00:11:51.860
they stayed.

212
00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:55.060
<v 5>We are ready now to take you to the principal observatory at Princeton</v>

213
00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.960
<v 1>because by then a strange meteor had landed</v>

214
00:11:58.490 --> 00:11:59.301
<v 5>where Carl Phillips,</v>

215
00:11:59.301 --> 00:12:01.870
our commentator will interview with Professor Richard Pearson,

216
00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:06.650
famous astronomer. The IB cannot question at any time.

217
00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:08.360
It's better. No.

218
00:12:08.361 --> 00:12:12.110
Quite convinced that the scientists that living intelligence as we know it does

219
00:12:12.111 --> 00:12:13.970
not exist on Mars. Right.

220
00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:18.230
They have the chances against it are a thousand to one and yet how do you

221
00:12:18.231 --> 00:12:21.290
account for these gas eruptions occurring on the surface of the planet at

222
00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:25.890
regular intervals cannot account for it. Just more related.

223
00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:26.601
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

224
00:12:26.601 --> 00:12:29.300
We've had four interruptions now at this point you've called your whole family

225
00:12:29.301 --> 00:12:30.134
into the room.

226
00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:34.450
<v 7>Marge media is on media is on Mars, March.</v>

227
00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:38.080
Meteors why meteors on Mars

228
00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:42.860
<v 1>and just as you are utterly confused, along comes the expert, you know,</v>

229
00:12:42.861 --> 00:12:45.950
people surveyed afterwards said, I didn't believe this thing.

230
00:12:45.951 --> 00:12:50.560
I thought it was all Bologna until I heard that government official guy or the a

231
00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:54.890
Princeton professor. And this script is chocked full of believable experts.

232
00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:58.070
<v 5>Great. Or the natural history museum professor [inaudible] Copper,</v>

233
00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:01.360
the California Astronomical Society there, General Montgomery Smith,

234
00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:02.980
Captain Lansing of the signal card.

235
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:06.580
<v 1>Maybe subconsciously that had an effect to convince people that something was in</v>

236
00:13:06.581 --> 00:13:07.414
fact happening.

237
00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:11.740
A feeling furthered a moment later when the professor and uh,

238
00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:15.460
the reporter Carl Phillips go live to that field in Grovers mill,

239
00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:18.790
New Jersey with that media, right? Or whatever it is, it's Atlantic.

240
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:21.980
<v 5>The metal casing is definitely extraterrestrial.</v>

241
00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:26.220
A not found on the friction with the earth. That must be yours with tears,

242
00:13:26.221 --> 00:13:28.530
holes in the media, right? The thing is moving.

243
00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:33.510
If something's happening, ladies and gentlemen, it's terrific.

244
00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:39.600
And the, the thing is beginning to flake off the top. It's beginning to rotate.

245
00:13:39.601 --> 00:13:41.460
Like a screw in this thing must be hollow.

246
00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:52.970
[inaudible] go the top,

247
00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:54.143
blow out that

248
00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:01.580
[inaudible] problem.

249
00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:06.680
One calling out something I can hang out of that black hole to Illumina's desk

250
00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:13.070
or the eyes might be a space, might be on the phone. Heaven.

251
00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.700
Nothing out of the shadow like a gray snake.

252
00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:20.060
That's kind of be shaped like a lie, but gripping sonic swimmer sweatshirt.

253
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:22.550
<v 1>I hate written lists. Lips sexually as do I.</v>

254
00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:27.250
Now before we get too far into this, see, let me play you a another clip,

255
00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:30.650
<v 6>right? Yep. Inviting Majestically Florida like them. Great. Better,</v>

256
00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:36.140
<v 1>no doubt. [inaudible] a little bit more.</v>

257
00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.390
<v 6>I mean the windows looking down the field ahead of them.</v>

258
00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:44.290
[inaudible] edits, edit pricing. Oh my. Get out of the way, please.

259
00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:47.800
If Bernie bursting into flames and then falling on the morning, bad.

260
00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:52.800
All the humanity and all the faceted Phoebe garage,

261
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:56.600
<v 1>this is tape of the Hindenburg crash. Sure. It's still fresh in people's minds.</v>

262
00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:58.160
Happened one year before the broadcast,

263
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:02.540
before going on the air that night after Frank Reddick who played that reporter,

264
00:15:02.541 --> 00:15:04.700
Carl Phillips in the field, he went to the library,

265
00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:09.350
dug up this old tape or not so old and played it to himself.

266
00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.850
<v 6>Oh, the humanity and all the faceted,</v>

267
00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:16.920
all the humanity and all the predators. Baby Garage, oh,

268
00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:19.550
the humanity and all the fans are just freebie.

269
00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:24.860
<v 1>Get himself in the right frame of mind for that now famous attack scene in that</v>

270
00:15:25.051 --> 00:15:25.980
field in New Jersey.

271
00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.140
<v 5>Those creatures know what that means about anything</v>

272
00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:34.780
[inaudible] happening. [inaudible] is rising out of the pit.

273
00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:38.140
Then they got a small beam of light against the mirror.

274
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:46.810
[inaudible] get the frame spangled [inaudible] head on.

275
00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:50.780
Hello did tell you the packed

276
00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:55.990
to the automobiles running everywhere coming. Just point out.

277
00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:59.383
<v 2>Cool.</v>

278
00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:05.530
<v 1>The transmission cuts off 12 million people have just heard slithery green</v>

279
00:16:06.341 --> 00:16:11.230
aliens. He visceral [inaudible], policemen, farmers and reporters followed by

280
00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:14.053
<v 2>nothing.</v>

281
00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.830
<v 5>Ladies and gentlemen, Yoda. Circumstances beyond our control.</v>

282
00:16:17.831 --> 00:16:20.500
We are unable to continue the broadcast from Grovers mill.

283
00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:24.520
Evidently there is some difficulty with our field transmission. However,

284
00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:27.190
we will return to that point at the earliest opportunity

285
00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:27.971
<v 1>and when they do return,</v>

286
00:16:27.971 --> 00:16:31.270
what you learn is that that grounded flying saucer that just zapped all those

287
00:16:31.271 --> 00:16:33.730
men has now stood up. It's grown legs,

288
00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.370
it's as tall as a tree and it is marching

289
00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:41.650
through the countryside, stopping everything in its path.

290
00:16:41.651 --> 00:16:44.660
And then we are taken to field reports, live battles,

291
00:16:44.661 --> 00:16:49.600
scenes between militia and positive. Before we do, let me play one more clip.

292
00:16:49.601 --> 00:16:50.210
This one is real.

293
00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:51.043
<v 8>If you ran,</v>

294
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:55.340
and one of the areas you mentioned are the type a child of school age and where

295
00:16:55.341 --> 00:16:59.330
did you have an evacuated? You should send him to school tomorrow.

296
00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:04.510
Friday with hand luggage containing the child got a change of underclothing.

297
00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:08.730
<v 1>This is Edward r Murrow reporting from London. Same time period.</v>

298
00:17:09.090 --> 00:17:12.900
Just to give you a sense of how scary it was to be alive at this moment in time,

299
00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:16.950
kids in England were being told to take gas masks to school,

300
00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:21.450
all of which would have made the following dramatize battle scenes.

301
00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:26.140
<v 2>They do now for the field headquarter, the State Mulatto, Robert Mill,</v>

302
00:17:26.141 --> 00:17:26.974
New Jersey,

303
00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.620
<v 1>all the more real [inaudible].</v>

304
00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:32.010
<v 2>It's 37 degrees.</v>

305
00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:41.380
<v 1>Here are the New Jersey militia fire on a fleet of Martian pods.</v>

306
00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:43.660
What if only does to no avail.

307
00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:50.370
There shells bounce right off in the margins and release a cloud

308
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:55.340
<v 0>or poisonous gas, which slowly overtake the soldiers. Sure</v>

309
00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:59.790
<v 5>they made us [inaudible]. He touched you.</v>

310
00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:05.360
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

311
00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.230
<v 5>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

312
00:18:06.231 --> 00:18:09.980
I have a grave announcement to make incredible as it may seem,

313
00:18:09.981 --> 00:18:14.120
both the observations of science and the evidence of our eyes lead to the

314
00:18:14.121 --> 00:18:17.510
inescapable assumption that those strange beings who landed in the Jersey

315
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:21.950
farmland tonight are the vanguard of an invading army from the planet Mars.

316
00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:28.110
The Battle of which took place tonight at Grove of mill has ended in one of the

317
00:18:28.111 --> 00:18:30.810
most stopping the feats ever suffered by an army in modern times.

318
00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:35.940
7,000 men armed with rifles and machine gun pit it against the single fighting

319
00:18:35.941 --> 00:18:40.020
machine of the invaders from [inaudible] 129 survivors.

320
00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:43.800
One moment please. Ladies and gentlemen,

321
00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:48.960
another Bolton from Lang and field Virginia amongst it is now in control of the

322
00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:51.810
Middle Section of New Jersey and has effectively cut the state through its

323
00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.460
center highways to the north, south and west.

324
00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:57.110
The quad with frantic human please not reserves are unable to control the MED

325
00:18:57.111 --> 00:19:00.230
flight communication lines that down from Pennsylvania to the let it go.

326
00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:03.780
Cracks the tone in service discontinued except Marsha law prevail throughout New

327
00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:04.620
Jersey in eastern Pennsylvania.

328
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:07.980
Other boats cutting planes report enemy machines down three number increasing

329
00:19:07.981 --> 00:19:11.030
speed north wind kicking over house at the same time we take you to Washington

330
00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.440
for the sons of a nation, the secretary of the interior,

331
00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:16.800
I shall not try to conceal the gravity it in.

332
00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:21.620
It handed me a your way auction. Paul ain't going on

333
00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:26.220
<v 2>[inaudible] now. No more defense.</v>

334
00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:29.840
Everything wiped out.

335
00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:50.590
[inaudible] [inaudible]

336
00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:53.230
<v 1>we don't know exactly how many people panicked that night.</v>

337
00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:54.773
Here's what we do now.

338
00:19:55.720 --> 00:20:00.640
The Trenton Police Department got 2000 calls in under two hours.

339
00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:06.360
The New York Times switchboard received 875 calls alone from people wanting to

340
00:20:06.761 --> 00:20:07.840
know where they'd be safer.

341
00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:13.080
<v 0>On the roof or in the gas rate shelter in the cellar. We,</v>

342
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:16.890
we're lucky we do have transcripts of what happened on the other side of radios

343
00:20:16.891 --> 00:20:17.311
that night,

344
00:20:17.311 --> 00:20:21.300
thanks to a Princeton sociologist who went out and conducted a series of

345
00:20:21.301 --> 00:20:22.980
interviews after the broadcast.

346
00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.460
And what's amazing is how effective that broadcast was.

347
00:20:26.461 --> 00:20:31.461
Some listeners said they actually felt like they were choking others reported to

348
00:20:32.671 --> 00:20:35.340
police that they saw with their own eyes.

349
00:20:35.341 --> 00:20:36.660
As they looked at the Manhattan skyline,

350
00:20:36.661 --> 00:20:40.380
they saw a thin veil of smoke from the battle over the city.

351
00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.900
Some said they saw Marsha machines' high,

352
00:20:42.901 --> 00:20:46.960
stepping their way down the palisade splash, splash, splash. Uh,

353
00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:50.260
and many people when they called operators or police, they didn't say,

354
00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:54.700
oh my God, we're being invaded by Martians. They said, oh my God,

355
00:20:54.701 --> 00:20:57.490
we're being invaded by Germans.

356
00:20:57.910 --> 00:20:59.920
Here are some of the literal transcriptions.

357
00:20:59.921 --> 00:21:02.800
This is what real people actually say. Everybody ready?

358
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:05.950
I knew it was some Germans trying to gas us all,

359
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.340
but when they announced or kept on calling them people from Mars,

360
00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:10.780
I just thought he was ignorant.

361
00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:14.350
I immediately called up the Maplewood police and asked if there was anything

362
00:21:14.351 --> 00:21:16.840
wrong. They answer, we know as much as you do.

363
00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.420
Keep your radio tuned in and follow the announcer's advice.

364
00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:23.630
<v 9>Yeah, I called into my husband, Dan, why don't you get dressed?</v>

365
00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:25.940
You don't want to die in your working clothes.

366
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:31.190
I looked in [inaudible] and saw some chicken left from Sunday dinner that I was

367
00:21:31.191 --> 00:21:34.460
saving for Monday night dinner, said to my nephew,

368
00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:39.590
we may as well eat this chicken. We won't be here in the morning.

369
00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:46.250
<v 10>This is Dawson Wells, ladies and gentlemen,</v>

370
00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:51.680
out of character to assure you that the war of the world has no further

371
00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:55.430
significant and at the holiday offering it was intended to be.

372
00:21:56.420 --> 00:22:00.710
We annihilated the world before your very ears and utterly destroyed the CBF.

373
00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:02.750
You will be relieved.

374
00:22:02.751 --> 00:22:07.430
I hope to learn that we didn't mean it and the both institutions are still open

375
00:22:07.431 --> 00:22:08.264
for business.

376
00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:12.900
<v 1>That was how Orson wells concluded the war of the worlds broadcast with those</v>

377
00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:17.280
words basically. Huh? It was a joke. Gotcha.

378
00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.520
But it was only after he and his producer,

379
00:22:20.521 --> 00:22:24.540
John has been left and read the papers the next day that they understood just

380
00:22:24.541 --> 00:22:29.541
how much trouble they had caused a disagreeable because of for at least a couple

381
00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:34.470
of hours. We believe we were mass murder,

382
00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:39.590
<v 11>extremely surprised to learn that a story which is become familiar to children</v>

383
00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:42.680
through the medium of comic strips and uh,

384
00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:45.300
<v 1>this as well as in the press conference that following day</v>

385
00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:50.930
<v 11>mini succeeding novels and adventure stories should have had such an immediate</v>

386
00:22:53.401 --> 00:22:55.590
and profound effect upon radio listeners.

387
00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:59.370
<v 1>So immediate and so profound that the FCC commissioner at the time,</v>

388
00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:03.010
George Henry Payne, labeled the Mercury theater of the air,

389
00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:05.970
get this terrorists

390
00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:09.470
<v 12>[inaudible]</v>

391
00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:10.610
<v 1>radio terrorists.</v>

392
00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:16.540
<v 13>But there is one thing we must not overlap all this took place in 1938 and our</v>

393
00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:21.770
less sophisticated yesterday that did not know the atom bomb guided missiles and

394
00:23:22.161 --> 00:23:24.850
rockets that may shortly fly to the Moon Edward

395
00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:27.430
<v 9>r Murrow in 1957. Was he correct when he said that?</v>

396
00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:33.330
<v 1>Where are we really? So on sophisticated in 1938. I mean,</v>

397
00:23:33.331 --> 00:23:37.110
it's so different from now. Wow. Let's see,

398
00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:41.850
can we interrupt this broadcast for some breaking news? Uh, this Justin,

399
00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:46.280
it seems we may have gotten a few things wrong when we, uh,

400
00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:47.720
performed that show many years ago,

401
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:50.280
most notably just now when I said that the FTC,

402
00:23:50.281 --> 00:23:55.281
a commissioner in 1938 called Orson Welles radio terrorists in his statement,

403
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:58.430
he certainly suggests that, but if you read it,

404
00:23:58.431 --> 00:24:02.060
it seems he was actually referring to a statement he made about a year earlier

405
00:24:02.061 --> 00:24:07.061
where he was calling radio producers who terrorize children.

406
00:24:07.671 --> 00:24:12.410
He doesn't actually name Orson wells by name. I just botched that.

407
00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:16.130
My apologies. And we have this guy to thank for bringing it to our attention.

408
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.150
<v 14>Michael Sokolow and I'm associate professor of journalism and communication at</v>

409
00:24:20.151 --> 00:24:21.200
the University of Maine.

410
00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:22.193
<v 1>And uh,</v>

411
00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:26.160
Michael Sokolow also makes an interesting argument that the panic may not have

412
00:24:26.161 --> 00:24:29.970
been as large as we made it sound. For example, uh,

413
00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:32.880
we state the 12 million people were listening on that night,

414
00:24:32.881 --> 00:24:37.470
which is a widely quoted number and it comes from polling done six weeks after

415
00:24:37.471 --> 00:24:38.161
the war.

416
00:24:38.161 --> 00:24:42.420
The world's first aired Sokoloff suspects that the actual number of listeners is

417
00:24:42.421 --> 00:24:46.530
way smaller and there's no way to know for sure, but he trusts. A poll conducted

418
00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:47.780
<v 14>that night.</v>

419
00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:52.810
That night when the broadcast was on 5,000 Americans were surveyed by the CE

420
00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:55.190
Hooper Company, the rating survey company.

421
00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:59.750
Why are we bothering with a study done six weeks later after the newspaper tells

422
00:24:59.751 --> 00:25:01.670
everybody that there was this giant panic?

423
00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:04.850
Why don't we look at the surveys that were done that night and the survey that

424
00:25:04.851 --> 00:25:08.360
was done 12 hours later by cvs the following morning? What are the two surveys?

425
00:25:08.361 --> 00:25:09.111
Immediately after,

426
00:25:09.111 --> 00:25:14.111
say the CE Hooper rating survey found 98% of the respondents were not listening

427
00:25:15.261 --> 00:25:16.730
to Orson wells or war of the worlds.

428
00:25:16.731 --> 00:25:19.760
They were listening to the chase and Sanborn hour or their radios were off or

429
00:25:19.761 --> 00:25:24.050
they were listening to another program of the 2% that they found that were

430
00:25:24.051 --> 00:25:25.430
listening to war of the world.

431
00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:28.760
Not a single respondent thought it was a news broadcast.

432
00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:33.070
<v 1>Sokolow strongly suspects that the panic was actually trumped up by the</v>

433
00:25:33.071 --> 00:25:38.071
newspapers who were trying to sort of piss on this new medium called radio that

434
00:25:38.651 --> 00:25:40.360
was taken away their, you know, audience.

435
00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:44.360
<v 14>Exactly. Here was the opportunity and a radio.</v>

436
00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:48.010
The radio industry and the newspaper industry had been battling for years and

437
00:25:48.011 --> 00:25:52.610
throughout that decade, the entire newspaper industry had been losing money,

438
00:25:52.611 --> 00:25:55.820
political prestige and other things too. The radio industry, you know,

439
00:25:55.821 --> 00:25:56.930
some of their best employees.

440
00:25:57.410 --> 00:26:01.460
And so they were waiting for a way to really prove to advertisers and prove to

441
00:26:01.461 --> 00:26:04.490
federal regulators, you know, they had the first amendment,

442
00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:07.520
they understood responsibility. These are the newspaper managers.

443
00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:11.210
These radio guys were conflating advertising with programming.

444
00:26:11.211 --> 00:26:13.880
They were frightening their viewers. They were acting irresponsibly.

445
00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:14.601
And remember,

446
00:26:14.601 --> 00:26:19.040
this is a month after Munich when radio prove that news really works on the

447
00:26:19.041 --> 00:26:23.090
radio. Well, one month after radio news comes of age,

448
00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:27.500
suddenly they're conflating news accounts with fiction and they're acting

449
00:26:27.501 --> 00:26:29.420
irresponsibly and they're terrorizing the public.

450
00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:32.930
And so the newspaper industry had the perfect thing to hang their critique of

451
00:26:32.931 --> 00:26:34.190
radio on. Interesting.

452
00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:36.300
<v 1>And that's interesting. So all those,</v>

453
00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:40.230
all those eye witness accounts that the panic and I thought it was this and I

454
00:26:40.231 --> 00:26:41.910
packed my bags and whatever, whatever.

455
00:26:41.911 --> 00:26:45.420
And all this sort of reports of people miscarrying.

456
00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:48.930
Do you feel like that's all in memory embellished or what?

457
00:26:48.931 --> 00:26:49.770
How do you explain that stuff?

458
00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:52.370
<v 14>Give you, let me give you an analogy. Okay.</v>

459
00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:55.100
If you were to ask 100 Americans today,

460
00:26:55.310 --> 00:27:00.080
did you see a plane fly into the World Trade Center on September 11th I think

461
00:27:00.081 --> 00:27:03.890
you would get an extremely high percentage of people saying they saw that plane

462
00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:07.610
flying in. But that's because it's part of our national visual memory.

463
00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:09.380
It's really a trauma and it's, it's,

464
00:27:09.381 --> 00:27:11.200
it's the kind of hysteria and panic we're talking about.

465
00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:14.120
So that moment in time and our relationship to the media. Okay.

466
00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:19.400
But if you were to actually find out whose TVs were on live at nine 48 in the

467
00:27:19.401 --> 00:27:21.980
morning that day and who was actually watching,

468
00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:25.160
there would be a discrepancy in that number. Now,

469
00:27:25.161 --> 00:27:29.510
am I saying all those people are lying? All those people are confused. No.

470
00:27:29.511 --> 00:27:34.370
What I'm saying is that the relationship of memory to the media is extremely

471
00:27:34.371 --> 00:27:35.204
complex,

472
00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:36.580
<v 1>complex indeed,</v>

473
00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:40.120
and we think Michael Sokolov for checking our facts and if you believe as he

474
00:27:40.121 --> 00:27:42.070
does, the 1938 panic was,

475
00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:45.460
well it didn't happen or it wasn't as bad as it sounds then that actually makes

476
00:27:45.461 --> 00:27:49.990
what we talked about next in our live broadcast. Even more puzzling,

477
00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:55.010
<v 0>we'll be right back with Radiolab live and this is lily from Laken Bagman</v>

478
00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:55.883

hi, I'm Robert Krulwich. Radiolab is supported by the Netflix film,

483
00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:18.630
the other side of the wind with this,

484
00:28:18.631 --> 00:28:21.900
the last film from legendary director Orson Welles.

485
00:28:21.901 --> 00:28:26.901
It's the story of director J J G Canford who comes back to Hollywood after years

486
00:28:27.391 --> 00:28:28.680
of semi exile in Europe.

487
00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:31.890
He plans to complete work on his own innovative comeback movie,

488
00:28:31.891 --> 00:28:35.550
which as it happens is also entitled the other side of the wind.

489
00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.920
It's a cinematic event 40 years in the making.

490
00:28:37.921 --> 00:28:42.210
The other side of the wind on Netflix and in select theaters November 2nd

491
00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:50.190
<v 1>this is Radiolab. I'm Jen. I have, I'm Rod. I'm Robert Krulwich.</v>

492
00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:52.860
We are in Saint Paul, Minnesota from the Fitzgerald Theater.

493
00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:56.760
Our subject today is the war of the worlds broadcast.

494
00:28:56.761 --> 00:28:59.700
Originally on October 30th, 1938

495
00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:02.820
<v 0>okay, now I'm gonna ask the house for a show of hands.</v>

496
00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:07.850
Do you think that somebody else could imagine the broadcast using the exact same

497
00:29:07.981 --> 00:29:11.220
script more or less? Also with Martians also invading,

498
00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:13.440
also interrupting the musical things.

499
00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:17.250
Same deal after all the publicity from the 1938 broadcast.

500
00:29:17.251 --> 00:29:22.050
Could you do it twice? Show of hands please. All.

501
00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:26.150
Some of you don't think so. Look, if we could,

502
00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:28.020
if there wasn't another one of these,

503
00:29:28.021 --> 00:29:31.470
what would we be doing for the next 40 minutes or so?

504
00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:34.780
<v 1>Those of you who've raised your hands? I'd say it's about 75% of you.</v>

505
00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:39.460
You are correct because it has happened again and I want to tell you a story.

506
00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:42.040
It an amazing story, really an underreported

507
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:46.720
<v 3>story of a war of the worlds reenactment happened in the mountains of Quito,</v>

508
00:29:46.721 --> 00:29:51.250
Ecuador, 1949 we were very lucky. We had a reporter, Tony Fields,

509
00:29:51.251 --> 00:29:52.600
who happened to be traveling there.

510
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:55.570
We asked him to do a couple of interviews and he brought back some tape and

511
00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:59.710
played it for me. All right, so Tony set the scene for me. 1949 Quito.

512
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:02.230
The where's Quito? Quito is the capital of Ecuador.

513
00:30:02.231 --> 00:30:06.550
Quito is in the middle of the mountains in the Andes mountains and small town,

514
00:30:06.551 --> 00:30:10.990
big town. Quito. Now is a big city. At the time it was a pretty small city.

515
00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:11.830
Um,

516
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:15.730
the word that everybody who I spoke to use to describe the way the Quito was in

517
00:30:15.731 --> 00:30:19.990
1949 was tranquillo. [inaudible].

518
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:23.740
Keela like tranquil. Exactly. It is what it sounds like.

519
00:30:23.741 --> 00:30:27.780
And Radio Quito was the most popular radio station. [inaudible]

520
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:30.490
<v 15>everybody was into it.</v>

521
00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:35.290
<v 3>So those are your basic ingredients. You've got a small town population,</v>

522
00:30:35.291 --> 00:30:39.070
250,000. You have one major radio station,

523
00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:43.060
which also happened to be in the same building as the one major newspaper,

524
00:30:43.061 --> 00:30:47.080
El Comercio and the leader of the radio station. The guy who ran it,

525
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:51.580
he a devious fellow by the name of Leonardo Pius.

526
00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:56.050
One day someone shows up with a script for a Orson Welles, not HD wills,

527
00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:00.040
Orson Welles version of war of the worlds, gives it to Leonardo Pius. He reads,

528
00:31:00.041 --> 00:31:04.090
it says, brilliant, we've got to do this here in Quito.

529
00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:06.070
They insert local place names, you know,

530
00:31:06.071 --> 00:31:08.020
so instead of the Martians landing in New Jersey,

531
00:31:08.021 --> 00:31:11.170
they would land in [inaudible], which is on the outskirts of Quito.

532
00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:15.130
They write in parts for government officials, the minister of the interior,

533
00:31:15.131 --> 00:31:18.670
the mayor of Quito actors or real government.

534
00:31:18.671 --> 00:31:22.240
These would be packers doing impressions, doing impressions. That's right. Whoa.

535
00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:26.380
Not only that. Pius got his bosses at the newspaper,

536
00:31:26.381 --> 00:31:30.820
El Comercio to agree to run little articles in the newspaper in the two days

537
00:31:30.821 --> 00:31:35.800
leading up to the broadcast recording that strange objects had been seen in a

538
00:31:35.801 --> 00:31:36.710
sky's over Keith.

539
00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:40.163
<v 15>Wow.</v>

540
00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:44.810
<v 3>So he set out to screw with people basically. I mean he was planting paranoia.</v>

541
00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:49.930
It really seems like he wanted people to believe what they were hearing that

542
00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:50.953
night.

543
00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:54.023
<v 15>Okay.</v>

544
00:31:55.100 --> 00:32:00.050
<v 3>Okay. So Saturday, February 12th, 1949 the day of the broadcast,</v>

545
00:32:00.410 --> 00:32:05.410
all day long listeners here and announcement windows [inaudible] notice that

546
00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:10.220
there's going to be a special performance duo, Benitez Valencia. No,

547
00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:11.640
they need this Valencia.

548
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.100
They need Valencia at that time were one of the most popular musical acts in

549
00:32:16.101 --> 00:32:17.660
town and [inaudible]

550
00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:22.490
<v 15>[inaudible]</v>

551
00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:26.710
<v 3>eight o'clock rolls around Beneatha's Valencia launches into their performance.</v>

552
00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:28.240
They play a few songs

553
00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:31.430
<v 15>[inaudible]</v>

554
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:35.900
<v 3>and suddenly there's an interruption. Wait,</v>

555
00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:39.020
what was that? Well, it turns out that Leonardo, the pies in addition,

556
00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:40.040
the other tricks he had up his

557
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:40.873
<v 16>sleeve,</v>

558
00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:45.880
he had a sound effects guy in the corner that was creating this sound like when

559
00:32:46.611 --> 00:32:48.050
it garrison Keillor's guys kind of a thing

560
00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:51.660
<v 4>that's right. Can keep everyone.</v>

561
00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:01.540
<v 16>Eventually the music stops and Leonardo Paez comes on the air and says,</v>

562
00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:07.720
[inaudible] please, dear listeners, excuse the technical difficulties.

563
00:33:07.721 --> 00:33:12.220
There seems to be some sort of atmospheric conditions interfering with the

564
00:33:12.221 --> 00:33:16.510
radio, those signal. But you are listening to radio ketosis brought to you by,

565
00:33:16.511 --> 00:33:19.480
you know, such and such. And now back to

566
00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:22.443
[inaudible].

567
00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:26.120
<v 3>So</v>

568
00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:29.060
<v 16>we hear another couple of songs and then there's another interruption.</v>

569
00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:34.580
Soon it's laying out the payers again. This time, this time it's a news flash.

570
00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:36.920
So now we're on script. That's right. That's right.

571
00:33:36.921 --> 00:33:40.070
They send pyres out to report from the scene

572
00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:43.670
and pies is doing the play by play. You know, what is it?

573
00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:48.640
<v 4>Oh my God, the cops in school, you know from the clinicals</v>

574
00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:53.130
<v 16>and here come the heat. Right</v>

575
00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:58.900
<v 17>and Zap. Hi, is this fry?</v>

576
00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:04.210
<v 3>You can wait, wait, wait, wait. Do we have forget reenactments?</v>

577
00:34:04.211 --> 00:34:07.420
Do we have a copy of the, the real broadcast from that night.

578
00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.190
All we have are descriptions.

579
00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:13.240
There is no existing recording of what was broadcast that night and,

580
00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:14.860
and you'll understand why in a second.

581
00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:20.580
By all accounts at work

582
00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:26.690
<v 16>outside, it was sheer Mei.</v>

583
00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:30.500
Everything that happened next happened extremely quickly.

584
00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:34.280
People tore it out into the streets. People were running,

585
00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:36.500
but they didn't know where to run.

586
00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:39.590
The spaceship supposedly was in the north of the city,

587
00:34:39.591 --> 00:34:44.591
but there's black cloud of gas was in the south and a lot of them actually did

588
00:34:44.991 --> 00:34:49.880
what any good Catholic would do. They made a beeline for the church,

589
00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:53.010
<v 3>which the church, because because they were,</v>

590
00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:55.530
they thought they'd be safe there or, or perhaps,

591
00:34:55.531 --> 00:34:59.700
or perhaps they just wanted to get right with God before the world ended there.

592
00:34:59.701 --> 00:35:01.620
Even reports, and I wasn't able to confirm this,

593
00:35:01.621 --> 00:35:04.890
but there were reports of men confessing to adultery right there in front of

594
00:35:04.891 --> 00:35:06.960
their wives and priests.

595
00:35:06.961 --> 00:35:11.690
Absolving whole crowds at once by Nico in

596
00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:17.930
[inaudible] citizen added to with [inaudible] Lee. This is Jorge by the Ada,

597
00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:20.990
who is a longtime journalist, worked for many years at the newspaper.

598
00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:24.890
He was listening with his family. They all believed it. They all ran outside,

599
00:35:24.891 --> 00:35:28.820
found a taxi cab to the kids in them, ran behind the taxi cab,

600
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:31.940
Eh, they were gonna [inaudible] the city

601
00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:38.550
[inaudible] and he tells me that he sees going the other way. This convoy,

602
00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:43.720
<v 16>military trucks filled with soldiers doing real trucks,</v>

603
00:35:43.721 --> 00:35:44.740
real military vans,

604
00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:48.760
real military vans are the real soldiers and cops behind them and they're

605
00:35:48.761 --> 00:35:52.120
screaming towards the north of the city. Where are they going?

606
00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:55.570
They're going to cut the coal yow to fight the Martians. Yeah.

607
00:35:57.340 --> 00:35:58.690
So if you, if you had any [inaudible]

608
00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:02.250
<v 1>doubt at this point, and once you saw those military events, you were like, oh,</v>

609
00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:05.460
bleep, I've got to get the hell out. Right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

610
00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:09.300
I to be does, does everybody in Kito believe,

611
00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:11.490
didn't someone call the general beforehand?

612
00:36:11.491 --> 00:36:12.740
Say Tonight we're having a broad thing.

613
00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:16.530
The mayor or someone who sounded an awful like the mayor was on the radio saying

614
00:36:16.531 --> 00:36:20.750
Martians are invading the mayor didn't call the general before a no. No. So,

615
00:36:20.751 --> 00:36:22.980
so then what happens at the end of the show?

616
00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:27.270
Assuming it ends the way they always do [inaudible] then what?

617
00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:29.970
Well, they, uh, stormed the radio station.

618
00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:38.220
<v 16>Let's go ahead. By the time of broadcast ended and it was announced,</v>

619
00:36:38.221 --> 00:36:40.110
but the whole thing was a play.

620
00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:45.500
A huge crowds were in the streets and word that it was a hoax spread pretty

621
00:36:45.541 --> 00:36:50.130
quickly. All that fear turned pretty quickly to anger

622
00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:56.370
by nine 30 is these a few hundred people outside the station?

623
00:36:56.730 --> 00:36:58.290
At some point there's boxers shows out.

624
00:36:58.291 --> 00:37:01.110
There just been a match in the Central Plaza and the boxer shows up and he's

625
00:37:01.111 --> 00:37:03.870
driving this truck and the truck is full of rocks.

626
00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:06.690
These little white rocks is full of rocks. Yeah.

627
00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:10.710
And people start hurling. The rocks at the station,

628
00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:14.950
at the windows and windows are shattering. They managed to break into the,

629
00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:18.990
to the ground floor with a printing presses on there, smashing printing presses.

630
00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:20.170
At some point,

631
00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:24.630
some people in the crowd materialize and they have these flaming torches and it

632
00:37:24.631 --> 00:37:28.050
just goes up like a matched it. So, so, so where people hurt during this

633
00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:32.780
<v 1>six people died. Oh really? Yeah, most escaped.</v>

634
00:37:32.781 --> 00:37:35.780
There was about 50 people in the building. Most got up to the roof,

635
00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:40.490
jump to adjoining buildings, but six people died according to a reporter, Tony,

636
00:37:41.170 --> 00:37:45.080
uh, one guy or stayed behind the last guy on the air.

637
00:37:45.081 --> 00:37:49.910
That night was a man by the name of Louis Beltran. Maria, are you there?

638
00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:50.903
<v 18>Yes, I'm here.</v>

639
00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:52.980
<v 1>Okay. This is Maria Beltran,</v>

640
00:37:52.981 --> 00:37:57.981
Testagrossa a Louis Beltran's daughter and Maria,

641
00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:02.330
you are listening to, to everything that just came before this. Yeah.

642
00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:06.510
Tell us the story from Your Dad's perspective, uh, from here forward.

643
00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:09.130
<v 18>Uh, well he was, he was on the air. He was the,</v>

644
00:38:09.131 --> 00:38:13.540
I guess hosting the music program and also doing some of the interruption with

645
00:38:13.541 --> 00:38:15.080
the, uh, with the bogus. Uh,

646
00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:19.060
<v 1>but the point at the point in which the fire started, what was he saying</v>

647
00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:22.210
<v 18>when he realized the magnitude of the situation?</v>

648
00:38:22.211 --> 00:38:27.211
He went back on the air and began pleading for help pleading for assistance from

649
00:38:27.341 --> 00:38:31.030
the police and the fire department. But as you said before,

650
00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:35.350
no help came because the police were going to fight the Martian. Yeah.

651
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:40.000
And uh, eventually he was the last one left and uh,

652
00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:42.370
and he jumped out the window.

653
00:38:42.371 --> 00:38:47.140
I'd get from the either the third or fourth floor onto a second floor balcony.

654
00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:51.850
And to break the fall, I guess it's of you want to break the fall.

655
00:38:51.851 --> 00:38:56.800
He grabbed onto the railing of that balcony and he was completely engulfed in

656
00:38:56.801 --> 00:38:57.850
flames at that point.

657
00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:01.810
And the skin on his hands just remained on the balcony.

658
00:39:01.811 --> 00:39:04.580
It was like a barbecue grill. And uh,

659
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:09.190
from there he jumped to the ground, but before he jumped,

660
00:39:09.191 --> 00:39:14.140
he was pleading to the crowd to I guess catch him, but they didn't.

661
00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:18.130
He landed on some meds, uh, broke legs,

662
00:39:18.850 --> 00:39:23.170
arm ribs, everything, and compounded by the very,

663
00:39:23.171 --> 00:39:26.290
very serious burns that he had all over his body.

664
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:29.710
<v 1>So he landed at the feet of an angry mob. What a dick</v>

665
00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:31.210
<v 18>mob. And He, uh,</v>

666
00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:36.560
he recall that as he's losing consciousness, he just heard somebody say,

667
00:39:36.561 --> 00:39:41.060
just, just let him die in peace. Although some of the articles that I read,

668
00:39:41.090 --> 00:39:44.660
they try to throw him back into the building. Really.

669
00:39:44.770 --> 00:39:49.160
Someone grabbed him and put him in a jeep to take him to the hospital.

670
00:39:49.161 --> 00:39:51.500
Just a bystander. And you know,

671
00:39:51.501 --> 00:39:56.100
he had so many scars here as children, like my brother and I would,

672
00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:57.590
we'd play with his scars.

673
00:39:57.591 --> 00:40:00.530
You would trace them with our finger and ask them what happened.

674
00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:03.410
You know how we got the scars and he would tell us about the fire.

675
00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:07.660
<v 1>What would he tell you? The whole story or how much of this did you know?</v>

676
00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:10.940
<v 18>Dory, he would just give us in just in broad terms,</v>

677
00:40:10.941 --> 00:40:14.540
but he had been in a building that caught fire, uh, as children.

678
00:40:14.541 --> 00:40:17.750
We didn't really ask him. Maybe had we been older and asked them,

679
00:40:17.751 --> 00:40:19.100
he would have told us the whole story.

680
00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:19.910
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

681
00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:23.750
And we should say that your dad stayed behind to try and help other people get

682
00:40:23.751 --> 00:40:26.330
out of the building. Well, let me ask you a question though. Uh,

683
00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.340
your dad obviously is a hero,

684
00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:32.480
but given the fact that he was one of the voices that created the panic,

685
00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:35.000
did he feel some sort of ambivalence about,

686
00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:37.440
<v 18>I don't know, in retrospect whether he did or not,</v>

687
00:40:37.441 --> 00:40:41.010
I'm sure there must've been some ambivalence. But from what I understand,

688
00:40:41.011 --> 00:40:42.180
the story was kept,

689
00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:47.210
it was very top secret so that even the employees did not know what was going to

690
00:40:47.611 --> 00:40:50.010
be broadcast during that music program. Really.

691
00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:53.230
I don't know at what point he was informed of the detail.

692
00:40:53.231 --> 00:40:55.260
So I don't know really how we felt about it.

693
00:40:55.261 --> 00:40:58.080
I wish I had had an opportunity to ask him.

694
00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:00.180
<v 1>MMM. Well listen, Maria,</v>

695
00:41:00.181 --> 00:41:04.980
thank you so much for your time and joining us here and yeah. Thanks. Perfect.

696
00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:11.460
<v 2>Aye. Aye.</v>

697
00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:16.010
<v 1>Want to know what happened to the guy who planned the hoax? Uh, well, uh, he,</v>

698
00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:18.800
uh, he got out through the roof like a lot of others.

699
00:41:18.801 --> 00:41:22.310
He hopped to the next building, hit out for a few days,

700
00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:25.730
and then fled the country to Venezuela. Never to return,

701
00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:29.180
never to return, never to return.

702
00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:33.950
But I should say that among the six people who died that night was his

703
00:41:33.951 --> 00:41:34.784
girlfriend

704
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:38.840
<v 0>and a nephew of his. Okay.</v>

705
00:41:38.841 --> 00:41:42.560
So the 1949 kito broadcast caused a whole lot of trouble.

706
00:41:42.561 --> 00:41:46.100
The 1938 New York broadcast caused a whole lot of trouble.

707
00:41:46.101 --> 00:41:49.100
Now everybody here before who raised their hand and thought that this could

708
00:41:49.101 --> 00:41:53.450
happen again, you are right again, Lau,

709
00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:57.230
buffalo, 1968

710
00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:01.330
<v 15>[inaudible] for the time it's sales.</v>

711
00:42:01.331 --> 00:42:06.110
Kind of like your basic Eja set until you hear this. What is your Joe Down here?

712
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:08.810
<v 19>And it'd be something here that I'm must supposed to read. Thank you.</v>

713
00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:11.270
Thank you Jo. Uh, let's see. The NASA, NASA,

714
00:42:11.271 --> 00:42:13.580
the national space in there and not access administration.

715
00:42:13.581 --> 00:42:17.000
Those people have alerted all their space watch and, uh,

716
00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:20.660
facilities to be on the alert for unusual communication difficulties tonight,

717
00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:24.560
I suppose before the Federal Agency referred to the explosions on the planet

718
00:42:24.561 --> 00:42:28.160
Mars and said it was not known if they would have the same effect on earth

719
00:42:28.161 --> 00:42:30.860
communications as similar explosions on the surface of the sun have,

720
00:42:30.861 --> 00:42:34.480
I guess I talking about sun spots and things like that. So, uh, I dunno, it, it,

721
00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:34.880
you know, it,

722
00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:37.560
it means that it's going to be hard to hear communications from NASA.

723
00:42:37.561 --> 00:42:37.940
I don't know.

724
00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:39.950
<v 15>Can you hear me? Daughter's South Carolina. Lord,</v>

725
00:42:39.970 --> 00:42:42.050
you can hear Kv whatevers you make about communication.

726
00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:46.250
Can you take what you're hearing on a week night,

727
00:42:46.251 --> 00:42:49.790
getting it all together where you double you?

728
00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:55.190
<v 9>W K BW broadcast followed the same structure as the original broadcast.</v>

729
00:42:55.311 --> 00:42:58.760
We've heard tonight long stretches of music than the news bulletins than the

730
00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:00.770
semi realistic field reports. Here's one of them.

731
00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:03.940
<v 15>Oh my God, you got walking injuries or are real bad.</v>

732
00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:06.670
<v 9>You got the same vivid descriptions of Martian.</v>

733
00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:08.800
<v 15>Hi My god, we all got a dog</v>

734
00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:14.820
<v 9>and according to the station manager Jeff K, he gets the same outcome.</v>

735
00:43:14.850 --> 00:43:16.230
People bought it.

736
00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:16.791
<v 19>Hello, hello.</v>

737
00:43:16.791 --> 00:43:21.020
Police and telephone company reported to Wk VW that they received more than

738
00:43:21.021 --> 00:43:22.250
4,000 phone calls.

739
00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:26.480
The Canadian military authorities dispatched military units to the Peace Bridge,

740
00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:29.450
the Rainbow Bridge, and the Queenstown Bridge to repel invaders.

741
00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:33.890
The story was carried the next day by 47 newspapers in the countrywide and on

742
00:43:33.891 --> 00:43:37.070
the night of the show and during the show in 90 press bureaus up and down the

743
00:43:37.071 --> 00:43:38.150
east coast of America,

744
00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:42.230
a besieged by phone calls asking about the Martian invasion and buffalo.

745
00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:45.260
Incredible. You're absolutely right. It is incredible.

746
00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:52.630
<v 15>[inaudible]</v>

747
00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:57.550
<v 9>thanks to the folks at Wk BW buffalo for that. What is this music, by the way?</v>

748
00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.150
This is the disco version of war of the worlds 1978

749
00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:06.670
there's a disco version. Still sells a lot of copies. You'd be surprised.

750
00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:14.110
Here's the obvious question to ask.

751
00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:17.360
<v 0>Why does this keep working? Well, that's a difficult question.</v>

752
00:44:17.361 --> 00:44:20.180
I came across a psychology professor, I'm Richard Gehrig,

753
00:44:20.350 --> 00:44:25.350
I'm a professor of psychology and the cognitive experimental program at Stony

754
00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:25.640
Brook University.

755
00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:30.080
He has this notion Richard Gehrig does and it root people are suckers for

756
00:44:30.081 --> 00:44:33.780
stories. We just cannot help ourselves. When a story starts,

757
00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:35.400
you just kind of go, whoa.

758
00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:39.160
<v 3>I think the norm is to fall into the story and that it's unusual to sort of</v>

759
00:44:39.161 --> 00:44:41.830
teach yourself from falling it. My favorite example is a,

760
00:44:41.831 --> 00:44:46.570
there's a scene in gold finger boom.

761
00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:49.390
Yeah, for the all time best James Bond movie.

762
00:44:49.391 --> 00:44:53.560
I think we're bond is tied down spread eagle on a piece of metal and there's

763
00:44:53.561 --> 00:44:56.680
this laser coming toward him which really looks like the to cut them into.

764
00:44:57.100 --> 00:44:59.260
And even as I'm saying that right now,

765
00:44:59.290 --> 00:45:01.990
I'm starting to feel a little bit of anxiety cause there's a picture get in my

766
00:45:01.991 --> 00:45:05.740
head. I'm picturing that laser coming toward him and you know, spoiler alert,

767
00:45:05.770 --> 00:45:10.330
he doesn't actually get split into by the laser yet. Sorry.

768
00:45:10.450 --> 00:45:11.230
But here's the thing.

769
00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:13.810
Go and watch the movie now and see if you can get through that scene without

770
00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:14.651
experienced suspense.

771
00:45:14.651 --> 00:45:19.651
And it really seems to say something very powerful and strong about how immerse

772
00:45:20.321 --> 00:45:22.420
we can become in the narrative world.

773
00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:31.140

779
00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:03.720
<v 21>is the sound of 700 people who come to bear witness to the recording of our show</v>

780
00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:06.600
<v 3>today. We are in the Fitzgerald Theater at Saint Paul,</v>

781
00:46:06.601 --> 00:46:10.170
Minnesota talking about these strange phenomenon that is the war of the worlds.

782
00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:13.610
<v 0>You know, I, it's very great that everybody's here, of course. But this I,</v>

783
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:18.440
there's one guy I really wish had been here. The Ecuadorian Guy Leonardo. Well,

784
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:21.860
let's just, because he, he's the guy I want to ask. Like,

785
00:46:21.861 --> 00:46:23.060
what were you thinking?

786
00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:26.773
<v 3>Well, he's dead.</v>

787
00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:29.700
<v 0>He's dead. Yeah. Well, but how Orson Wells, I would say to him,</v>

788
00:46:29.701 --> 00:46:32.490
what were you thinking? I would say dead had. Yeah.

789
00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:35.520
So I found a guy who I think is definitely alive.

790
00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:37.770
I am Daniel Myrick co-writer,

791
00:46:38.050 --> 00:46:42.840
Co director of the Blair witch project before making the Blair witch project.

792
00:46:42.841 --> 00:46:45.450
And my Rick heard a recording of the war of the worlds.

793
00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:47.310
He was pretty young at the time. He was a teenager.

794
00:46:47.370 --> 00:46:49.410
I just thought it was brilliant.

795
00:46:49.530 --> 00:46:52.500
I absolutely the coolest thing and more than anything else,

796
00:46:52.501 --> 00:46:54.780
he was impressed by the technique of the thing.

797
00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:58.380
There's a couple of moments in particular where they cut to the kind of onsite

798
00:46:58.381 --> 00:47:01.390
reporter telling you to call fill ups that drover's. Yeah,

799
00:47:01.391 --> 00:47:04.830
it's almost like cut in a second or two early and you hear the reporters saying,

800
00:47:04.831 --> 00:47:08.160
so are we on my eye? Are we, are we gonna Ladies and gentleman?

801
00:47:08.161 --> 00:47:10.020
And then he goes into his into character.

802
00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:12.630
Here I am back with stone wall and it says little beats,

803
00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:14.580
a little moments that really make it convincing.

804
00:47:14.970 --> 00:47:17.910
I get this kind of guilty excitement when I,

805
00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:22.380
when I know how it affected people and he was fascinated by the idea that scary

806
00:47:22.381 --> 00:47:27.030
stories get even scarier if you think they're true. So years later,

807
00:47:27.031 --> 00:47:27.900
fresh out of film school,

808
00:47:27.901 --> 00:47:32.230
he and his friend Eduardo Sanchez decided to develop their own a wells like

809
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:35.470
products. Your basic scary, which story? Three a kids go into the woods.

810
00:47:35.810 --> 00:47:38.030
<v 19>Hey, okay, we're leaving right now. They get lost.</v>

811
00:47:38.031 --> 00:47:41.270
They bumped into the witch and then they die or they think they die.

812
00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:42.410
You never see them again.

813
00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:47.050
<v 0>But when you entered the theater to see the bear, which project,</v>

814
00:47:47.051 --> 00:47:50.140
the first thing that you'd see on the screen are these two sentences.

815
00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:55.470
In October of 1994 three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near

816
00:47:56.441 --> 00:48:00.580
Burkittsville, Maryland while shooting a documentary. A year later,

817
00:48:00.610 --> 00:48:02.740
their footage was found.

818
00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:07.770
So the suggestion here is that what we see might be real

819
00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:08.741
<v 19>well,</v>

820
00:48:08.741 --> 00:48:13.741
we picked a subject matter that was difficult to disprove to the casual

821
00:48:13.871 --> 00:48:18.370
observer. Martians invading from outer space is you turn the channel to the next

822
00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:19.030
networking.

823
00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:22.540
If no one's reporting about it pretty well assured is probably fiction,

824
00:48:22.541 --> 00:48:25.360
but three missing students in the woods, you know,

825
00:48:25.361 --> 00:48:29.020
that's something that is a little harder to disprove without a fair amount of

826
00:48:29.021 --> 00:48:31.450
scrutiny. And it worked.

827
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:35.680
We were getting calls from police wondering where these three kids were and how

828
00:48:35.681 --> 00:48:38.350
come they never heard of this case? You're kidding. Oh yeah.

829
00:48:38.351 --> 00:48:39.280
I mean it was constant.

830
00:48:39.390 --> 00:48:42.640
We still getting emails occasionally on what part of the story is real.

831
00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:46.570
You know, is there still any phenomena out in Burkittsville and DA, da Da. Dot.

832
00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:48.430
All fiction and is all made up.

833
00:48:48.431 --> 00:48:52.990
And I think it reinforces what I think Ed and I suspected that so much of us

834
00:48:53.290 --> 00:48:54.280
wants to believe.

835
00:48:54.310 --> 00:48:57.760
Some people told Dan Myrick that after watching the sweet campers go in the

836
00:48:57.761 --> 00:49:01.000
woods, they themselves would never go camping again.

837
00:49:01.450 --> 00:49:05.360
And he thought that was fabulous. He loved rule. Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa,

838
00:49:05.361 --> 00:49:09.220
Whoa, whoa, Whoa, whoa. Why would you not want people to go camping?

839
00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:14.260
I mean, we know honestly. Why would you do that to people? Well, I asked him,

840
00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:15.990
I mean, that's why you're doing it. You know,

841
00:49:16.310 --> 00:49:18.640
we're not making this movie to kindest scare people.

842
00:49:19.090 --> 00:49:21.070
We were making the film to really scare people.

843
00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:29.610
No regrets on people not wanting to go camping afterwards.

844
00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:32.300
So

845
00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:36.350
<v 0>the question is, is that what Orson Welles was up to back in 1938?</v>

846
00:49:36.351 --> 00:49:39.980
Was he just trying to give people a good old fashion show business scare,

847
00:49:39.981 --> 00:49:42.050
make them scream away, up in the balcony.

848
00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:44.480
Cause remember at the time that is what he claimed,

849
00:49:44.481 --> 00:49:47.270
that this was simply an entertainment.

850
00:49:47.290 --> 00:49:49.180
<v 10>This is Dawson Wells, ladies and gentlemen,</v>

851
00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:53.980
out of character to assure you that the war of the world has no further

852
00:49:53.981 --> 00:49:56.650
significance and it's the holiday offering.

853
00:49:56.651 --> 00:49:59.610
It was intended to be the mercury theater,

854
00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:03.040
his own radio version of dressing up in a sheet and jumping out of a Bush and

855
00:50:03.041 --> 00:50:03.880
saying boo.

856
00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:08.990
<v 0>16 years later, Orson wells changed the story.</v>

857
00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:13.150
Here he is on the BBC. The year is 1955

858
00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:16.600
<v 11>in fact, we weren't as innocent as we meant to be.</v>

859
00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:18.820
And we did the Martian broadcast.

860
00:50:18.821 --> 00:50:23.821
We were fed up with the way in which everything that came over,

861
00:50:23.921 --> 00:50:28.730
this new magic box, the radio was being swallowed. So in a way,

862
00:50:28.731 --> 00:50:31.540
our broadcast was an assault on the, uh,

863
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:34.280
credibility of that machine.

864
00:50:34.281 --> 00:50:39.281
We wanted people to understand that they shouldn't swallow everything that came

865
00:50:39.771 --> 00:50:40.670
through the tap.

866
00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:44.620
<v 0>So here are two ways to think about the war of the worlds. One,</v>

867
00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:48.460
it was a smashing entertainment using every trick they could think of including

868
00:50:48.461 --> 00:50:50.740
inventing some new ones to scare you.

869
00:50:50.741 --> 00:50:54.190
Silly master storytelling or or,

870
00:50:54.191 --> 00:50:57.820
and it was, we're trying to send you a warning.

871
00:50:57.821 --> 00:51:02.500
Don't trust everything you hear on the radio. It's not always true too.

872
00:51:02.501 --> 00:51:04.900
Which one was it you think? Well,

873
00:51:05.170 --> 00:51:09.450
I asked the professor Jason Lavilla [inaudible] me. Yeah, you Jason Him.

874
00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:12.700
He's a radio historian at the University of Maryland.

875
00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:17.820
He says that what Welles understood was that a newscast is often two things at

876
00:51:18.701 --> 00:51:23.500
once in a newscast. You hear something scary or disturbing sometimes,

877
00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:27.010
but it's going to be told to you in a way that sues you,

878
00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:29.410
meaning the authority of the voice, the newscasters,

879
00:51:29.411 --> 00:51:31.090
steady voice coming through the radio.

880
00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:35.320
It will calm you like President Roosevelt's famous fireside chat

881
00:51:35.970 --> 00:51:36.803
<v 11>friend.</v>

882
00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:41.320
I want to prop for a few minutes with the people of the United States about

883
00:51:41.321 --> 00:51:41.860
banking.

884
00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:44.920
<v 22>When you studied the rhetoric that Roosevelt used,</v>

885
00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:47.560
he really did convey two messages.

886
00:51:47.561 --> 00:51:51.790
One were in terrible danger and too, I've got it covered.

887
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:56.530
And that is the sort of the, the authoritative voice coming out of the darkness,

888
00:51:56.531 --> 00:52:01.480
this sort of invisible, disembodied voice of the powerful man. Um,

889
00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:04.870
the news anchor, September 22nd,

890
00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:07.240
1940 and we'll see this with Moreau on the rooftops.

891
00:52:07.570 --> 00:52:12.570
<v 19>Rick standing on a roof top during the plane looking out over London straight in</v>

892
00:52:13.171 --> 00:52:17.150
front of me. Now you hear two sounds and just a moment are

893
00:52:18.850 --> 00:52:22.560
he's giving us a story of an unfolding emergency,

894
00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:25.380
I should think in a few minutes. There may be a bit of shrapnel around here,

895
00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:30.750
but his mastery of the information, his mastery of his own voice,

896
00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:32.910
his bravery on the scene.

897
00:52:32.911 --> 00:52:36.090
You may be able to hear the sound of guns off in the distance, very frankly,

898
00:52:36.091 --> 00:52:38.460
like someone kicking a tub. But this was the big [inaudible]

899
00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:41.750
<v 22>getting of the formatting of fear,</v>

900
00:52:41.751 --> 00:52:43.670
the formatting of crisis.

901
00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:47.840
And so people go to the news not to be afraid,

902
00:52:47.841 --> 00:52:50.600
but to be afraid. And then to be reassured,

903
00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:54.330
<v 0>Robert [inaudible] you file things for the news. Yeah.</v>

904
00:52:54.690 --> 00:52:59.690
Do you buy this that a news reporter does these two things simultaneously scares

905
00:52:59.851 --> 00:53:02.290
and then reassures and then scale. You never go, you know,

906
00:53:02.610 --> 00:53:05.070
go cover the governor and say, first I'm going to scare them,

907
00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:07.110
but then I'm going to assuage them, you know, when would do that?

908
00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:09.300
Why else would you talk that way? I mean not you,

909
00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:12.990
but I mean the form in of the news is a,

910
00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:16.080
because the guy is always there because he's an anchor.

911
00:53:16.081 --> 00:53:17.370
That's what the word means.

912
00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:21.600
It is a reassuring thing to see them night after night telling and telling,

913
00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:26.250
but loving Leo says that the real genius of the war of the was that wells put

914
00:53:26.251 --> 00:53:30.900
you into a newscast where you expect anchors to anchor and you expect reporters

915
00:53:30.901 --> 00:53:35.901
to report and then he kills the reporter and the anchor and suddenly you're left

916
00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:39.510
all by yourself in your own living room all alone.

917
00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:42.010
<v 17>Okay.</v>

918
00:53:42.010 --> 00:53:46.160
<v 1>That is exactly right. The moment of the war of the worlds broadcast,</v>

919
00:53:46.210 --> 00:53:49.330
which still frankly terrifies me. It's this moment, right? Yeah.

920
00:53:49.530 --> 00:53:52.860
<v 17>Here by some head on to tell you to play</v>

921
00:53:54.410 --> 00:53:55.520
by the words, the

922
00:53:58.710 --> 00:54:01.600
running every way coming to find out about 20 yards. Right?

923
00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:07.310
<v 1>It's like that silence is terrifying. No anchor, no reporter,</v>

924
00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:11.120
no one to reassure you. Okay,

925
00:54:11.121 --> 00:54:12.920
but forgetting that for a moment.

926
00:54:12.921 --> 00:54:15.230
What about his second lesson that he had to teach us the thing about don't

927
00:54:15.231 --> 00:54:17.750
believe the radio. What about that? Did it work?

928
00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:19.230
<v 0>Well, Professor at Louisville, Leo says,</v>

929
00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:22.860
if that is really what wells was trying to do, if you believe that,

930
00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:26.640
well then he failed. Actually, he worse than failed the war of the worlds.

931
00:54:26.641 --> 00:54:30.420
Not once, not twice. We've shown you three broadcast tonight.

932
00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:34.650
It was so good at grabbing an audience and sucking them in that the wills

933
00:54:34.651 --> 00:54:35.131
formula,

934
00:54:35.131 --> 00:54:38.910
you might call it the newscast that scares you enough to keep you listening has

935
00:54:38.911 --> 00:54:41.700
been adopted by of all folks news

936
00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:45.520
<v 17>right now at 11 and nine of shopping during the two. One night of fear,</v>

937
00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:50.740
swarming over borders, flooding cities and towns, Muslim immigrants, teens,

938
00:54:50.770 --> 00:54:51.850
texting and driving.

939
00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:56.880
It's a deadly mixed terror in the toilet and sink holes and landslides.

940
00:54:56.980 --> 00:54:58.490
Python in the cod,

941
00:54:58.540 --> 00:55:02.170
a rapid baby go terrorists working at one of our airports,

942
00:55:02.820 --> 00:55:06.160
<v 0>timber in the toilet, pythons in the potty. He may be,</v>

943
00:55:06.330 --> 00:55:10.700
there will be true snake somewhere near a toiletry facility of some kind.

944
00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:14.930
But it probably wasn't the python and it probably wasn't your toilet,

945
00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:16.370
but you don't know that.

946
00:55:16.371 --> 00:55:20.530
You want to hear that it belongs to Mrs. James C McGillicuddy of 2114 boday

947
00:55:20.540 --> 00:55:23.660
boulevard and not you. So you,

948
00:55:23.690 --> 00:55:27.650
you want to be reassured and so you listen and so you fall Ian.

949
00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:32.960
And if Orson Welles retelling a Martian invasion story by hg wells that most

950
00:55:32.961 --> 00:55:35.510
people already knew, if he could grab us

951
00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:41.400
<v 9>and then if they could do it again in Ecuador and then if they can do it again</v>

952
00:55:41.561 --> 00:55:46.450
in Buffalo, what does that tell you? It tells you that we can't help ourselves,

953
00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:51.790
even if the headline is slightly preposterous, even if it's slightly scary,

954
00:55:52.270 --> 00:55:54.550
even if it's slightly false,

955
00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:57.520
we will listen.

956
00:55:59.110 --> 00:56:04.110
The fear that these broadcasts generate now suck us in.

957
00:56:04.241 --> 00:56:08.050
And you'd think that 70 years later we'd be more sophisticated and critical.

958
00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:11.650
When the local newscaster tells us that there's something we're feeding our

959
00:56:11.651 --> 00:56:15.120
children that could kill them, and they'll tell us after the news, the we,

960
00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:16.450
I still listen.

961
00:56:16.540 --> 00:56:20.440
I'm a media critic and I still wait through the commercials to see what is it

962
00:56:20.441 --> 00:56:23.010
that I'm doing to kill my child. Even if it's really implausible,

963
00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:26.680
your shoelaces will kill you after this beat method. I somehow,

964
00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:30.990
it gets me every time. Yeah.

965
00:56:30.991 --> 00:56:32.430
And wells knew

966
00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:41.620
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>
