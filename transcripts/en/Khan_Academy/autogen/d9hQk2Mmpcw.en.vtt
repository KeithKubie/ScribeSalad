00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.260
never got a full context of you know
what were all the dynamics that led to

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270
what were all the dynamics that led to
 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.490
what were all the dynamics that led to
the civil wars it's just something that

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500
the civil wars it's just something that
 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.220
the civil wars it's just something that
happened overnight oh definitely not you

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230
happened overnight oh definitely not you
 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.130
happened overnight oh definitely not you
know I think the seeds of the Civil War

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140
know I think the seeds of the Civil War
 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.169
know I think the seeds of the Civil War
were really with the United States at

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179
were really with the United States at
 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.600
were really with the United States at
its creation you know I think there's a

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610
its creation you know I think there's a
 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.910
its creation you know I think there's a
sort of an essential contradiction in

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920
sort of an essential contradiction in
 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.010
sort of an essential contradiction in
the United States as it's born you know

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020
the United States as it's born you know
 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.990
the United States as it's born you know
where this country where all men are

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000
where this country where all men are
 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.200
where this country where all men are
created equal except that most of the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210
created equal except that most of the
 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.970
created equal except that most of the
states in the south have slavery where

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980
states in the south have slavery where
 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.610
states in the south have slavery where
people are clearly not created equal so

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620
people are clearly not created equal so
 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.560
people are clearly not created equal so
you know they couldn't win the

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570
you know they couldn't win the
 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.110
you know they couldn't win the
Revolutionary War without including

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120
Revolutionary War without including
 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.850
Revolutionary War without including
those states and kind of giving them

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860
those states and kind of giving them
 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.920
those states and kind of giving them
what they wanted in retaining slavery

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930
what they wanted in retaining slavery
 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.860
what they wanted in retaining slavery
but it means that you know the u.s. is

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870
but it means that you know the u.s. is
 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.979
but it means that you know the u.s. is
born with both free states and slave

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989
born with both free states and slave
 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.070
born with both free states and slave
states and they're going to continue to

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080
states and they're going to continue to
 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.250
states and they're going to continue to
try to figure out how to balance those

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260
try to figure out how to balance those
 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.440
try to figure out how to balance those
for the rest of the 1800s and we have

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450
for the rest of the 1800s and we have
 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.260
for the rest of the 1800s and we have
this map here this map is a later period

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270
this map here this map is a later period
 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.050
this map here this map is a later period
but it shows the this is actually closer

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060
but it shows the this is actually closer
 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.030
but it shows the this is actually closer
to the Civil War but if we leaving to

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040
to the Civil War but if we leaving to
 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.859
to the Civil War but if we leaving to
look at the original 13 colonies you can

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869
look at the original 13 colonies you can
 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.450
look at the original 13 colonies you can
see which ones were free states and

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460
see which ones were free states and
 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.490
see which ones were free states and
which ones were which ones were slave

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500
which ones were which ones were slave
 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.050
which ones were which ones were slave
states and then you obviously have these

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060
states and then you obviously have these
 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.219
states and then you obviously have these
other states that come in later which

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229
other states that come in later which
 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.690
other states that come in later which
will which we'll talk about but this

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700
will which we'll talk about but this
 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.149
will which we'll talk about but this
what you're saying is the founding of

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159
what you're saying is the founding of
 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.530
what you're saying is the founding of
the country this was already an issue

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540
the country this was already an issue
 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.850
the country this was already an issue
people are you know there were people in

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860
people are you know there were people in
 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.550
people are you know there were people in
the North who weren't fans of slavery

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560
the North who weren't fans of slavery
 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.410
the North who weren't fans of slavery
and people knew that somebody's being

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420
and people knew that somebody's being
 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.420
and people knew that somebody's being
irreconcilable or maybe they hoped it

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430
irreconcilable or maybe they hoped it
 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.429
irreconcilable or maybe they hoped it
would be reconcilable a difference

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439
would be reconcilable a difference
 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.560
would be reconcilable a difference
listen we got to unify against Great

the ears right you can't hold on to it
 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.440
the ears right you can't hold on to it

their interests so we have that that
 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.960

it's you know that the issue is there

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970
it's you know that the issue is there
 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.180
it's you know that the issue is there
from from the

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190
from from the
 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.530
from from the
the moment that the country is founded

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540
the moment that the country is founded
 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.510
the moment that the country is founded
and then we get into the 1800s which is

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520
and then we get into the 1800s which is
 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.710
and then we get into the 1800s which is
really the run-up year the Civil War

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720
really the run-up year the Civil War
 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.040
really the run-up year the Civil War
doesn't start until you know we get into

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050
doesn't start until you know we get into
 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.040
doesn't start until you know we get into
1860 or shortly thereafter what or

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050
1860 or shortly thereafter what or
 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.640
1860 or shortly thereafter what or
actually 1860 what what is you know what

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650
actually 1860 what what is you know what
 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.650
actually 1860 what what is you know what
are what are the what's the big picture

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660
are what are the what's the big picture
 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.590
are what are the what's the big picture
that really leads up to it well I think

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600
that really leads up to it well I think
 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.470
that really leads up to it well I think
what we're looking at when we get into

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480
what we're looking at when we get into
 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.560
what we're looking at when we get into
the issues that lead to the civil war is

really about how the u.s. handles
 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.080
really about how the u.s. handles
getting new territory right the u.s. was

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090
getting new territory right the u.s. was
 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.370
getting new territory right the u.s. was
getting a lot of you territory we have a

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380
getting a lot of you territory we have a
 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.370
getting a lot of you territory we have a
map here it's the first really big chunk

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380
map here it's the first really big chunk
 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.810
map here it's the first really big chunk
is you have the Louisiana Purchase in

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820
is you have the Louisiana Purchase in
 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.200
is you have the Louisiana Purchase in
1803 and so you get all of see let me

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210
1803 and so you get all of see let me
 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.480
1803 and so you get all of see let me
shade it in you get you know roughly all

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490
shade it in you get you know roughly all
 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.240
shade it in you get you know roughly all
of this stuff right over here so that's

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250
of this stuff right over here so that's
 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.600
of this stuff right over here so that's
new areas that it settlers can go and

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610
new areas that it settlers can go and
 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.080
new areas that it settlers can go and
write and and it comes officially part

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090
write and and it comes officially part
 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.630
write and and it comes officially part
of the US and what else happens so you

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640
of the US and what else happens so you
 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.090
of the US and what else happens so you
know as we get these new territories out

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100
know as we get these new territories out
 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.890
know as we get these new territories out
of them you're going to get new states

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900
of them you're going to get new states
 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.340
of them you're going to get new states
and when new states come into the Union

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350
and when new states come into the Union
 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.020
and when new states come into the Union
they're going to come in as either free

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030
they're going to come in as either free
 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.110
they're going to come in as either free
states or slave states so you know we've

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120
states or slave states so you know we've
 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.630
states or slave states so you know we've
balanced the interests of the north and

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640
balanced the interests of the north and
 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.000
balanced the interests of the north and
south up until this point right from the

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010
south up until this point right from the
 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.430

it's famously Napoleon sold it for quite
 

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:14.640
it's famously Napoleon sold it for quite
cheap because that he couldn't defend it

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:14.650
cheap because that he couldn't defend it
 

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:16.140
cheap because that he couldn't defend it
because he was not even tours and he's

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:16.150
because he was not even tours and he's
 

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:17.490
because he was not even tours and he's
fighting these wars in Europe that's the

fighting these wars in Europe that's the
 

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.230
fighting these wars in Europe that's the
big that's the first chunk of land so

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:19.240
big that's the first chunk of land so

you have all of these states and they

00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:20.409
you have all of these states and they
 

00:07:20.409 --> 00:07:21.959
you have all of these states and they
need to figure out whether their slave

00:07:21.959 --> 00:07:21.969
need to figure out whether their slave
 

00:07:21.969 --> 00:07:23.730
need to figure out whether their slave
slave states are free states but why

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:23.740
slave states are free states but why
 

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.170
slave states are free states but why
would I mean I talked about why would a

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:25.180
would I mean I talked about why would a
 

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.089
would I mean I talked about why would a
northerner care whether a slave or free

00:07:27.089 --> 00:07:27.099
northerner care whether a slave or free
 

00:07:27.099 --> 00:07:28.260
northerner care whether a slave or free
trade why would a southerner care why

trade why would a southerner care why
 

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:30.570
trade why would a southerner care why
would I may if I'm a slave owner I owned

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:30.580
would I may if I'm a slave owner I owned
 

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.339
would I may if I'm a slave owner I owned
a plantation in South Carolina or

00:07:32.339 --> 00:07:32.349
a plantation in South Carolina or
 

00:07:32.349 --> 00:07:34.769
a plantation in South Carolina or
Georgia why do I care if Missouri is a

00:07:34.769 --> 00:07:34.779
Georgia why do I care if Missouri is a
 

00:07:34.779 --> 00:07:37.290
Georgia why do I care if Missouri is a
slave state or a free State well I think

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:37.300
slave state or a free State well I think
 

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:38.580
slave state or a free State well I think
you know just as their political

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:38.590
you know just as their political
 

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:41.399
you know just as their political
interests are tied up in slavery all of

00:07:41.399 --> 00:07:41.409
interests are tied up in slavery all of
 

00:07:41.409 --> 00:07:43.469
interests are tied up in slavery all of
their money is tied up in slavery you

00:07:43.469 --> 00:07:43.479
their money is tied up in slavery you
 

00:07:43.479 --> 00:07:46.890
their money is tied up in slavery you
know in 1860 the most valuable thing

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:46.900
know in 1860 the most valuable thing
 

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:50.600
know in 1860 the most valuable thing
that anyone owns in the United States is

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:50.610
that anyone owns in the United States is
 

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:54.450
that anyone owns in the United States is
slaves right you can't you can't compete

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:54.460
slaves right you can't you can't compete
 

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.579
slaves right you can't you can't compete
with that kind of money so they want to

00:07:56.579 --> 00:07:56.589
with that kind of money so they want to
 

00:07:56.589 --> 00:07:59.999
with that kind of money so they want to
make sure that if a new state comes into

00:07:59.999 --> 00:08:00.009
make sure that if a new state comes into
 

00:08:00.009 --> 00:08:03.240
make sure that if a new state comes into
the Union that state isn't a free state

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:03.250
the Union that state isn't a free state
 

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.550
the Union that state isn't a free state
because then the free states might have

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:05.560
because then the free states might have
 

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.070
because then the free states might have
more representation in Congress and then

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:08.080
more representation in Congress and then
 

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.559
more representation in Congress and then
they can vote to outlaw slavery so if

00:08:10.559 --> 00:08:10.569
they can vote to outlaw slavery so if
 

00:08:10.569 --> 00:08:12.959
they can vote to outlaw slavery so if
your whole fortune is built on slavery

00:08:12.959 --> 00:08:12.969
your whole fortune is built on slavery
 

00:08:12.969 --> 00:08:15.420
your whole fortune is built on slavery
if you're a white slave owner they

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:15.430
if you're a white slave owner they
 

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:17.040
if you're a white slave owner they
outlaw that then you're left with

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:17.050
outlaw that then you're left with
 

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:19.679
outlaw that then you're left with
nothing I see so in the north there's a

00:08:19.679 --> 00:08:19.689
nothing I see so in the north there's a
 

00:08:19.689 --> 00:08:20.969
nothing I see so in the north there's a
moral argument there's the economic

00:08:20.969 --> 00:08:20.979
moral argument there's the economic
 

00:08:20.979 --> 00:08:22.860
moral argument there's the economic
argument slavery slavery is hard to

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:22.870
argument slavery slavery is hard to
 

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.529
argument slavery slavery is hard to
compete with and the South hey if we

00:08:25.529 --> 00:08:25.539
compete with and the South hey if we
 

00:08:25.539 --> 00:08:26.760
compete with and the South hey if we
have too many of these free states at

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:26.770
have too many of these free states at
 

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:27.629
have too many of these free states at
some point they're going to have a

00:08:27.629 --> 00:08:27.639
some point they're going to have a
 

00:08:27.639 --> 00:08:29.429
some point they're going to have a
majority you know enough of a voting

00:08:29.429 --> 00:08:29.439
majority you know enough of a voting
 

00:08:29.439 --> 00:08:33.240
majority you know enough of a voting
power in the government to to to maybe

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:33.250
power in the government to to to maybe
 

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.159
power in the government to to to maybe
abolish slavery one day which would

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:35.169
abolish slavery one day which would
 

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:37.170
abolish slavery one day which would
completely undermine if I'm a slave

00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:37.180
completely undermine if I'm a slave
 

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:39.430
completely undermine if I'm a slave
owner my you know my

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:39.440
owner my you know my
 

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.730
owner my you know my
my economics of my reality right I mean

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:42.740
my economics of my reality right I mean
 

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:45.280
my economics of my reality right I mean
and they are sort of essentially amoral

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:45.290
and they are sort of essentially amoral
 

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:47.530
and they are sort of essentially amoral
even you know someone like Jefferson who

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:47.540
even you know someone like Jefferson who
 

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.660
even you know someone like Jefferson who
knows that slavery is wrong his whole

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:49.670
knows that slavery is wrong his whole
 

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:51.700
knows that slavery is wrong his whole
wealth his whole fortune his whole

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:51.710
wealth his whole fortune his whole
 

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:54.910
wealth his whole fortune his whole
political dynasty is built on the

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:54.920
political dynasty is built on the
 

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.310
political dynasty is built on the
fortune of owning slaves and and you

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:57.320
fortune of owning slaves and and you
 

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.400
fortune of owning slaves and and you
know one of the the first points where

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:00.410
know one of the the first points where
 

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:02.380
know one of the the first points where
this you know this really gets balanced

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:02.390
this you know this really gets balanced
 

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:04.150
this you know this really gets balanced
this issue is we have Louisiana Purchase

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:04.160
this issue is we have Louisiana Purchase
 

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.850
this issue is we have Louisiana Purchase
in 1803 then starting to carve out the

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:06.860
in 1803 then starting to carve out the
 

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:07.930
in 1803 then starting to carve out the
Louisiana Purchase you have states like

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:07.940
Louisiana Purchase you have states like
 

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:10.000
Louisiana Purchase you have states like
Missouri they get to their critical mass

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:10.010
Missouri they get to their critical mass
 

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:12.190
Missouri they get to their critical mass
of people of populations so that they

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:12.200
of people of populations so that they
 

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.810
of people of populations so that they
can become a state and so what was the

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:13.820
can become a state and so what was the
 

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:15.730
can become a state and so what was the
Missouri Compromise all about in 1820

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:15.740
Missouri Compromise all about in 1820
 

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:19.180
Missouri Compromise all about in 1820
so the Missouri Compromise is when we

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:19.190
so the Missouri Compromise is when we
 

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:21.040
so the Missouri Compromise is when we
have enough people living in Missouri

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:21.050
have enough people living in Missouri
 

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:22.480
have enough people living in Missouri
you know these are white people

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:22.490
you know these are white people
 

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:25.660
you know these are white people
generally coming who have come from the

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:25.670
generally coming who have come from the
 

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:27.760
generally coming who have come from the
eastern states and they apply for

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:27.770
eastern states and they apply for
 

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:30.250
eastern states and they apply for
statehood you've got an equal number of

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:30.260
statehood you've got an equal number of
 

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.920
statehood you've got an equal number of
slave states and free states already in

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:32.930
slave states and free states already in
 

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:35.500
slave states and free states already in
Congress so if Missouri comes in they

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:35.510
Congress so if Missouri comes in they
 

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:37.630
Congress so if Missouri comes in they
want to be a slave state they're going

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:37.640
want to be a slave state they're going
 

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.070
want to be a slave state they're going
to upset the applecart they're going to

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:39.080
to upset the applecart they're going to
 

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.810
to upset the applecart they're going to
upset the balance so there will be more

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:40.820
upset the balance so there will be more
 

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:43.660
upset the balance so there will be more
representatives for the south than there

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:43.670
representatives for the south than there
 

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:45.760
representatives for the south than there
will be for north and everything they've

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:45.770
will be for north and everything they've
 

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:47.830
will be for north and everything they've
done so far has been predicated on this

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:47.840
done so far has been predicated on this
 

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.110
done so far has been predicated on this
sort of tenuous balance between free

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:50.120
sort of tenuous balance between free
 

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:54.580
sort of tenuous balance between free
states and slave states so you know they

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:54.590
states and slave states so you know they
 

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:57.700
states and slave states so you know they
debate this in Congress just four months

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:57.710
debate this in Congress just four months
 

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:00.310
debate this in Congress just four months
and eventually what they do is say all

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:00.320
and eventually what they do is say all
 

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.140
and eventually what they do is say all
right well we can't decide so we're

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:02.150
right well we can't decide so we're
 

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:05.380
right well we can't decide so we're
going to do is admit the state of Maine

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:05.390
going to do is admit the state of Maine
 

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:08.740
going to do is admit the state of Maine
at the same time and administer the

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:08.750
at the same time and administer the
 

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:10.660
at the same time and administer the
territory of Maine was already part of

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:10.670
territory of Maine was already part of
 

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:12.430
territory of Maine was already part of
the United States what I mean how is it

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:12.440
the United States what I mean how is it
 

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:15.190
the United States what I mean how is it
not already a state it was part of

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:15.200
not already a state it was part of
 

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.230
not already a state it was part of
Massachusetts but as you can see you

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:17.240
Massachusetts but as you can see you
 

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.330
Massachusetts but as you can see you
know it's really only tenuously

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:19.340
know it's really only tenuously
 

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.000
