Speaker 1:          00:01          Alright. Sorry, Robert, I have you to turn to, I'm gathering my thoughts as I'm speaking. Yeah. Okay. All right. Robert? Yes. Season two, finale of more. Perfect. Yes. Long overdue, but much anticipated maybe. Yeah. Maybe among those who care among the [inaudible] care, it growing, number one, one can help you having a modest day to day. It's, you know, it's uh, it's Tuesday. It's Tuesday. It's modesty. Tuesday. Yes. Modesty. Tuesday. Okay. So I want to bring you a story from the more perfect, the final story of season two because this story fulfills a promise I made to myself at the very beginning of more. Perfect. Oh my God. This question of yours is that old and that deep. It's only two years old. Just two girls show. But when people hear what the question is, they will, eyeballs will be rubbed. No, no, no. All right. Go ahead. Tell them it's modesty. Tuesday. What was it two years ago that stuck you at a question you have never been able to let go of question and everybody will let go. One of the first questions I bumped into and learning about the Supreme Court [inaudible] was why does everybody keep talking about this thing called the commerce clause? Commerce cloud commerce commerce clause.

Speaker 1:          01:09          The commerce clause. Yes. That had a dazzle for you. No, I just wanted to know what the hell is it? Well, it's article one, section eight, clause three of the constitution, 16 words to commas. Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states and with the Indian tribe, the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations. And among the several states and with the Indian tribes, there are no more sexier words in the English language. Yes. Better words for Wuhan were never written. That's Jamie Floyd and Ari Savitsky will meet them properly in just a second. Okay. So turns out that question of like, what is it is pretty easy to answer to these 16 words in the constitution that say, uh, Congress has the power to regulate commerce from one state to another. Like as soon as it goes between states across state borders, the feds can regulate it.

Speaker 1:          01:58          I think that they're with the SAI would begin and end and that would be the only way. So, well, yes, but here's the thing within that Shell of Boring is I'm politely silent. Here is an amazing story of a kind of cosmic power that develops from very humble beginnings to something truly extraordinary and maybe troubling depending on who you are. A cosmic power. You mean this phrase from the constitution has had consequences that surprised you? Oh boy. Oh boy. Here's how I've been thinking about it in the more perfect story. For me, the experience I had learning about the commerce clause was a little bit like watching the x men movies. Initially I was like, my name is Mike NATO. Why is magneto the head of the bad guys do join my brother Hood and fight? Why would they follow him? He has the most boring power. Your, I mean he can control metal. Okay, well like those mystique can shift into any shape she wants. Dorm can control lightning.

Speaker 2:          03:01          Initially, his [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          03:02          power seem like you have the worst one. So we start with the commerce clause and we ask the riddle of magneto. I am trying to cross the bridge and getting, I'm getting there. All I'm saying is that like initially I didn't understand the true deep nature of his power, but then

Speaker 2:          03:19          you see these scenes where he's like being attacked by a thousand policemen and he just kind of makes their bullets freeze in midair or he picks up a whole bridge with lights pointing at it and then it hits you all.

Speaker 1:          03:37          Oh, he has the best

Speaker 3:          03:40          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          03:41          because the whole world is made of metal

Speaker 3:          03:46          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          03:46          he can control the world

Speaker 3:          03:50          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          03:50          if we built the world a different way, maybe not yet in this world, let's just say I'm Frankenstein's monster,

Speaker 4:          03:59          periodic table, baby periodic table baby.

Speaker 1:          04:02          So that's for me what it was like to learn about the commerce clause. What initially seems stupid and boring becomes extraordinarily powerful. Once you understand that the world in which it is situated, does that mean you're about to take us on a, on a journey which begins with something that feels utterly trivial and ends up with being something enormously powerful? Wow. Has a question to which I simply must answer. Yes.

Speaker 4:          04:35          The question. We laid it all out there. I am doing well then we can get, we can get on with it then.

Speaker 1:          04:41          Yeah. I won't tell you the story of the commerce clause. Everything we fight about in America is in these 16 words,

Speaker 5:          04:49          the honorable, the chief justice, and the associate justices of the Supreme Court of the United States. Oh, Yay. Yay. Yeah. Before the honorable, the supreme court in the United States rent money to draw an Aaron [inaudible] card. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          05:30          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          05:32          All right. I'm gonna. I'm gonna Start you good? Yup. To even explain why something like the commerce clause exists, just pull out a dollar bill. Go ahead and pull it out. Right. If it's issued by a central bank, are you looking at a dollar bill? Right now? I'm looking at dollar bill says Federal Reserve Note, United States of America. That is James Chen, professor of law at Michigan State University. Now the thing about a dollar bill, the awesome obvious thing is that you can take that dollar bill and buy some sour patch kids or whatever a dollar buys these days anywhere in America. Right, but in the late 18th century, in fact, all the way through to the 20th century, it wasn't like that. No, no, no, no, no. All the states had their own banks and their own bills, different sizes, colors. For example, there was a moment when South Carolina has this pretty little green South Carolina Bill, same time Rhode Island has this giant pink square thing, and if you are a South Carolinian in Rhode Island trying to buy some carrots and potatoes, let's say, let's say that, and you've got to make payments somehow.

Speaker 1:          06:38          What do you do? Well, you hand them your South Carolina Bill. Well, the Rhode Islanders would look at that and say, well, I don't know if this is who's to trust this bank. Right? And so they would discount the note based on the distance from their own home. They would discount the note based on how it looks, how professionally drawn up it was. They might look at that $10 and say, that's only worth eight. To me, that's a horrible [inaudible] way to do business. That sucks for the person who holding the note. Right? And so what the government decided to do is to say, hey, we're just gonna use one bill, just one bill. It's gonna be so much easier. This is one of the ways government is going to pull all these different states together. They were gonna regulate the currency and not just the currency itself. They were going to regulate the flow

Speaker 6:          07:26          of that currency. And this is where the commerce clause comes in.

Speaker 3:          07:34          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          07:34          this is Jamie Floyd, journalist, sometimes legal analyst, host of all things considered here at WM YC. It's early in the republic. Now we're at 1820s no, just to hit pause for one second. So the commerce clause was a preexisting thing. Oh yeah. Okay. Oh yeah. It's in the US Constitution. But it's never been really like thought about or where, where is it in the minds of people a date? Do you know where? Nowhere. Pretty much where it is right now. It's nowhere in the minds of people.

Speaker 3:          08:02          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          08:05          she says 1824 to steamboat operators get into a thing. It's a business dispute. They're each going back and forth between New York and New Jersey. They each thing, they should be the only one allowed to do that and it makes its way, as we say, all the way to the u s supreme court and who's sitting up there? Well, a big bad dude named John Marshall. Marshall is the sort of Rambo of the court. He looks at those 16 words, Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states. He looks at those 16 words and a couple of commas and a period and he decides pretty much for the first time that those words give Congress the power to regulate commerce between and among states. This boat is going from one state to the other. The only way

Speaker 1:          08:56          to resolve that is for the federal government to come in and control it. Again, the idea is that this is the only way for the country to function as a unified thing.

Speaker 7:          09:10          And John Marshall, when he writes his decision, he says it, look, we have a United States of America. We don't have a divided states of America or independent states of America or New Jersey and New York existing separately. We decided to organize as a United States. And so what John Marshall says is because of that, there has to be a power to regulate trade between those states and amongst those states when there are disputes, otherwise it's all gonna fall apart.

Speaker 1:          09:49          It was at that point that the commerce clause began to glow, but very faintly for the next hundred years, the government would experiment with the commerce clause in cases involving trade with the native American tribes or navigation. But if you want to talk about power, like real, raw, weird power, that power got unleashed, uh, at a very specific moment around 1941 in a wheat field. Well, what happened in the wheat field? Okay, well let me introduce you to someone

Speaker 8:          10:25          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          10:26          my father was a farmer. I'd like to say all of these life took pride in the fact that he never, he never worked for another man. Uh, he would tell me that. Can you introduce yourself? Well, my name is the same as my father. It's Roscoe Curtis, Phil Brun. I'm a junior Roscoe film burn as he was known at the time. He was a fifth generation farmer in Montgomery, Ohio. Our, our farm was just right next to Dayton, Ohio. Roscoe is about a 40 year old man at this point. Ken, we're talking about 1941 42 good looking, sturdy, fiercely independent. I never worked for another man in my life. Apparently that was his motto. He would tell me that many times over the years. If you had to put like captain America with a pitchfork,

Speaker 1:          11:19          this is him.

Speaker 6:          11:21          So Roscoe's got this farm more than a hundred cows on it. He would milk cows until both of these arms went practically numb. Wow. Cat chickens, 3000 chickens. And we had them a very big garden. He would plant things, you know, like string beans, Lima beans, peas, sweet corn, potatoes, carrots, radishes. Couple of different kinds of fruit trees, apples, cherry trees, peach trees, pears, strawberries and raspberries. Oh. And of course they had crops. We would grow corn and couple of different kinds of hay, oats and course

Speaker 1:          11:54          wheat, wheat. Okay. Set up out of the way. Here's what happened. Um, it's 1941, Roscoe senior.

Speaker 6:          12:03          My dad was out in the field I think on his tractor

Speaker 1:          12:08          that day. He was plowing the weed or something and

Speaker 6:          12:11          there permanently must've been a, some guy from the Department of Agriculture locally, I guess going around to various farmers in our community, a wanting the farmers to answer several pages. I think of questions. And this particular day, this government, uh, a gentleman came out in the law field. He looked around

Speaker 1:          12:39          and he said, Rosco, by my calculations, you've got 22 acres of wheat on this farm. You're over your quota. He was 11.1 acres over what was permitted roughly. And so the guy tells him, you have to pay a fine, really big fine.

Speaker 6:          13:00          My Dad looked over and he was just as sober as that judge in a courtroom on a murder case.

Speaker 1:          13:06          And what happened next would change the country forever in ways that we are still literally living with. But let me just sort of fill in the gaps here, tell you what you need to know about why they're, why they were even having this conversation. And to help me with that. My name is Ari Syvitski and I'm an attorney. Let me bring in a friend of the show, man of the law. You know, an important thing to understand is that, you know, when our story starts with Roscoe Filburn

Speaker 9:          13:32          agriculture is a huge percentage of the economy. The Great Depression is happening up on the central panic, gripped the world and the dust bowl, the great dust storms of the mid 1930s has happened to [inaudible] America's great plains. And so you have a lot of people who rely on selling crops and buying crops. And so wheat prices too matter of life and death for millions of Americans, this nation is paying far Ectron and a come out.

Speaker 1:          14:00          So look, so 1938 congress enacts what's called the Agricultural Adjustment Act to reboot the economy. So the 1938 Agricultural Adjustment Act got the federal government into the business of regulating wheat. Basically what the government did was they said to the farmers of America, we are going to give you essentially a loan. We're gonna guarantee you a certain minimum price for wheat. We're going to give you x number of dollars per Bushel or whatever it is, and that will help lift you out of poverty. In exchange for that, you have to promise us to only grow a certain amount. This is the big fear was that if they grew too much, there'd be this flood of supply on the wheat market, prices would crash. And that will be bad for everyone. You know, wheat is sort of a collective action problem, right? Everyone's going sell as much weed as they can, but that means prices go down and everyone makes less.

Speaker 1:          14:55          So what the government decided to do in addition to giving out loans is that they placed a cap on how much wheat a person could grow. So quota, straight up quota. That way you ensure that the supply of wheat is steady and you ensure that, uh, that the prices don't crash. And the whole reason the government could do this regulate the entire wheat market was by hinge Egon on the commerce clause. Those 16 words that basically said that when something like wheat is bought and sold and moved from one place to another, one state to another cross state lines, well that's interstate commerce and that's something that Congress can regulate.

Speaker 6:          15:33          So my father having this brings us back to Roscoe Filburn would that inspector on his farm inspector says, look, Roscoe, you've grown too much wheat. My Dad looked over and he was just as sober as that judge in a courtroom on a murder case. And what do you think? He says back, he says, wait a minute, I'm going to tell you what, just exactly how I feel about that. No, that's how I feel. No, you government, I don't know. He might've been a family guy. Yeah. He says, I don't get it. I'm not, I'm not, I have nothing to do with interstate commerce. And

Speaker 1:          16:06          this is the key.

Speaker 10:         16:10          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          16:11          he explains to the inspector that yes, according to the government quota, I'm only supposed to grow about 11 acres of wheat and I am growing 23 but that extra 12

Speaker 10:         16:21          hello.

Speaker 6:          16:22          I'm not selling it to anybody. He doesn't sell the week. He doesn't trade the wheat. What's he doing with his wheat? He uses all the wheat to feed his animals who use feeding it to the farm animals. The weight. He fed the some of the wheat to the stares. I, I was just keeping it on the farm. Well, yes. So it's in a completely internal operation. I do. I sound biased here. I'm going to feel like the poor guy gets kind of dragged into a national case in case he tells the inspector I'm not, I have nothing to do with interstate commerce. Just grown a little extra wheat to feed my cows. I'm on my farm, I'm doing my business.

Speaker 1:          16:54          Big, big brother. Leave me alone. But big brother does not leave him alone. The inspector says we're the government. That's the law. Please uphold it. Pay the fine 50 cents for every excess Bushel. I think it is. He had 239 excess bushels of wheat for which he was, you know, fine about 117 bucks in today's dollars. It's about two grand, two grand.

Speaker 10:         17:23          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          17:24          my, my father, apparently he wasn't real crazy about that and I guess he didn't like that too much. If I'd have been 20 or 25 years old, I would have probably advised my father not to do what he did. But I guess he sued the federal government. Huh? His argument was like, look, I'm just trying to feed my cows. Come on. I guess it went to on our court in Dayton, Ohio. That was the first stop.

Speaker 1:          17:50          And I believe that he was

Speaker 6:          17:52          one round one to Roscoe. The Ohio court agreed. There's no commerce of any kind nine going on. You're unlike the original case with the boat. Right. I believe I even remember him, uh, my sister telling me that the, he came home and he was just, uh, delighted that he did win. But then,

Speaker 3:          18:15          okay,

Speaker 1:          18:15          the government appeals the case and of course the one had got to the Supreme Court of the United States.

Speaker 3:          18:23          Okay.

Speaker 1:          18:24          He, he, he lost

Speaker 3:          18:29          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          18:29          He lost in a decision that I think it's fair to say still drives conservatives and Libertarians bonkers and I am neither one of those things, but I get it. What the Supreme Court said is it Roscoe Filburn growing that extra wheat and not selling, it still counts as interstate commerce because half of that extra week causes him to not buy it on the market. He needs less wheat from the market and if all the farmers of America did that,

Speaker 9:          19:02          then that'd be really bad for the market. The idea is that if you need more wheat than the quota, you go on the market and buy it. Even though you can grow it yourself, you got to buy it because if everyone can produce their quota and then whatever extra they need, I mean pretty soon the regulation breaks down, which means that the government intervention in the wheat market will fail. You will have defeated our attempt to regulate this market. Therefore we have to regulate. Even the things you don't do.

Speaker 3:          19:34          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          19:34          See that is so weird. It's such a mind. Frankly. It's like, well, he's not doing anything. Well, we'll just literally non behavior. This is, this is Obamacare. It's very much like the healthcare case. It's getting heated over healthcare. Today's issue, the individual mandate, just to explain, that's a reference to Barack Obama's healthcare plan. There's hotly debated a couple of years ago, still hotly debated. One of the key ideas of that plan is that in order for healthcare to be affordable for everyone independent, everyone should have to buy it, so we're going to require people to buy insurance or else you pay a penalty, which made a lot of people mad because they're like, hey, the government's forcing me to buy something. I don't want. My decision not to get healthcare is not participation in interstate commerce. It's not even economic activity. I'm sitting here on my couch not buying healthcare. I'm just sitting here from the individual perspective. That makes perfect sense. But in the aggregate, if you pan out and justice Kagan said this in court, it's not so simple

Speaker 11:         20:33          and the aggregate of all these uninsured people are increasing the normal family premium congresses by $1,000 a year. Those people are in commerce. They're making decisions that are

Speaker 9:          20:48          uh, affecting the price that everybody pays for this service. Obamacare makes sense to me in some, in some spiritual way, but getting back to Roscoe, we're regulating the things you're not doing. No farmers and islands.

Speaker 7:          21:03          This is the case in which Congress receives a tremendous amount of power from the U S Supreme Court. Essentially this case, it says that Congress can regulate almost anything and that is the single most significant precedent in the area.

Speaker 3:          21:26          The Big Bang [inaudible].

Speaker 9:          21:40          Did anyone sort of raise their hand in the middle of this and be like, Whoa, if you can regulate the non behavior of this American farmer, then that's not even a slippery slope. That's like a cliff that goes right down to like there's no slope to that. Yeah. A New York Times editorial from November 13, 1942 said, if the farmer who grows feed for consumption on his own farm competes with commerce, would not the housewife who makes herself address do so equally. The net of the ruling in short seems to be that Congress can regulate every form of economic activity if it so decides would not the housewife who makes herself address do so ego. Yeah. It's like, yeah, if you make something like, shoot, my wife and I with our kids made these little like a miniature stuffed animals for them to play with the other day. Are we then in violation of some on my desk? Seems crazy to make the kids do it and now you've violated some child labor laws. Even

Speaker 1:          22:33          so like what happened to your essentially Robert is the, um, the definition of commerce, uh, changed in as in a sneaky but really powerful way. Cause now it wasn't just like the buying and selling of stuff. It was the not buying and selling of stuff. Yeah. It was your negative commercial activity. That is all the things you don't do as a much bigger territory than the things you do do. Yeah. It's a massive extension of power and that expansion would continue over the next few decades and it would move from just wheat to something much deeper to like beyond markets into the, into matters of the heart. You mean like people hating on each other or people trusting people being great. People all will become clear after the break. After the break. Excuse me while I get myself up this sizzling drink and settled down in my black leather couch. Ooh. Yeah. All right. Season two, finale of more perfect here on radio lab. We'll continue in a moment.

So we have a newsletter, which I know everyone does, but hear me out. Unlike a lot of other newsletters out there, uh, we don't waste your time by just blabbing about what our next release will be or begging you for money. Uh, actually we, we do a little bit of that. Uh, but what we also do is each time a new episode drops, we send you a list of staff picks, essentially a collection of things to folks here who make this show have come across recently and are excited about, uh, they range from books and music to TV shows, youtube clips, art exhibits, blogs.

Speaker 13:         24:48          It's sort of a repository for the stuff that's got us interested. But for whatever reason, uh, we're not sure how to turn into a radio story. So if that sounds interesting to you at all, I hope you'll sign up for it. Our newsletter, it's free and you can sign up in about just 30 seconds at radiolab.org/newsletter or even easier. Just text our l news as in radio lab news to seven zero one zero one that's RL news to seven zero one zero one and thanks.

A strange and Heartfield salute to the commerce clause of the U s constitution. Yes. And uh, previously we had the big bang in the wheat field, but that was still about markets and commerce and all that, right? Yeah, there was a moment about two decades after the wheat case where you might say the commerce clause got weaponized. Hm. Hello? Hey, can you hear me? Yes. This is Jad from a Radiolab and more perfect in New York and Jack. Jack j. A d. J. A. J. A d. Okay. Well Andrew is here and he's recording to really understand what I mean, you have to meet this guy. Can you reduce yourself? Tell me who you are. Your name? Yes, there's Ollie McClung jr. And how old are you? 77

Speaker 1:          26:44          and where are you speaking to us from right now? I'm in Birmingham, Alabama. You were born in Birmingham? Yes. Gotcha. Aside from some time at college in Florida and a stint in the coast, coastguard Ali Jr has lived in Birmingham his entire life. And the reason we call them up is that for 75 years, his family ran a famous barbecue joint named Dolly's. So this is your dad's business from what I understand, right? Yes. My grandfather actually had founded it. Oh really? When was that? 1926. So this was passed to your dad who passed it to you? Yes. Okay. We were in business together until he died. Ollie's BBQ was located on Birmingham south side of the building. We were in at the time, you're talking about 1949 til 68. It was concrete block, a big sign outside said world's best barbecue. Pretty good for today. Apparently during lunch the line would stretch out the door. Ali's was famous for its slow cooked pork and chicken and for its a spicy vinegar barbecue sauce, a on the pad baking chocolate pies. We always did a lot of pies, but Ollie's was also famous or would become famous for something else entirely.

Speaker 15:         27:53          Oh, uh, locales. The Times, uh, in the way things were, uh, at that time course throughout south and Birmingham, uh, we had, uh, carry out business as well as sit down business and, and uh, those of our black customers came in and, uh, ordered from the carry out counter and took their food out and, um, you know, truth fact history, uh, they would take it on, uh, with them to eat as opposed to sitting down and eating.

Speaker 1:          28:26          What he's saying is that Ollie's barbecue was segregated. If you were white, you could eat inside. If you were black,

Speaker 15:         28:31          you couldn't remain. That was the way it work. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          28:35          okay. So what does this have to do with the commerce clause? Okay, so the federal government at the time, this would be the Kennedy Administration. Then LBJ, they wanted to come down and places like Ollie's BBQ, but their hands were sort of tied. I mean, we have this thing called the 14th amendment, which says, no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property without depressive of law. Nor shall any state denied equal protection of the laws to any person. James Chin again? No. Those words he says, which were ratified right after the civil war were written to basically outlaw things like segregation. Of course, it didn't work. We'd have another 80 plus years of Jim Crow. And the reason for that is that the Supreme Court shortly after the 14th amendment was passed kind of new debt. Well, not kind of. They did. And one of the ways they did was by insisting that we read the 14th amendment as being targeted only at states.

Speaker 2:          29:36          If you look at that sentence, the second sentence of the 14th amendment says, no state, no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without depressant. The problem is, is when a restaurant owner like Ollie McClung denies service to black patrons, it's not Alabama doing the damage just to private business. It's not as if Alabama ordered the McClung family to discriminate against black patrons. They just did it. So the 14th amendment can only get to states here it has no reach because if there's no state action, there is nothing to regulate at the state level. So

Speaker 10:         30:15          [inaudible]

Speaker 14:         30:15          with the feds decided to do in a fascinating bit of legal gymnastics is they decided to use

Speaker 2:          30:24          [inaudible] the commerce clause. Congress passes the most sweeping civil rights bill ever to be written into the law, giving all Americans the right to be served in facilities, which you wrote them in the public.

Speaker 14:         30:34          July 2nd, 1964, congress passes a sweeping civil rights bill that was hinged on those 16 words. And I will explain to you how, because it's kind of fascinating in just a second, but first just to get us to that point. So 1964 civil rights act is passed. Did you desegregate right away? No. No.

Speaker 15:         31:00          Well we were, we were not happy with it. Obviously,

Speaker 14:         31:03          I want to read to you something that you said in 1964. I believe these are, this is sort of your account or something that happened in, in your restaurant day after the Civil Rights Act was passed. A black man comes into the restaurant asking to be served and uh, and you turn them away. 45 minutes later it comes back with a young girl for other black people. They sit down at the counter, they want to know why you, why Ali's wouldn't serve them. And they were taking notes and you're quoted as saying they seem like

Speaker 15:         31:32          dictators. Yeah. In fact, they were, they, uh, they were folks that came, uh, and went around several places, uh, just to test the law basically. Yeah. And you were a, and you were turning those folks away. Yes. You kicked them out. [inaudible] and why don't we just, because that's way, uh, we had always done this way until the law got adjudicated. Uh, we weren't going to unilaterally, uh, change, but they, you know, from their perspective, they're there because the laws have been changed.

Speaker 10:         32:09          Yeah. Yes. [inaudible]

Speaker 14:         32:17          Holly says right after the Civil Rights Act was passed, sort of an emergency meeting was called of the a Birmingham Restaurant Association and he and his dad went

Speaker 15:         32:26          when we, uh, discussed with the, um, with them and with the executive of it, that this was going to be such a potentially, uh, harmful to the restaurant businesses. Like you wouldn't lose all your customers. Is that what you

Speaker 14:         32:40          were worried about? I mean that that was a possibility

Speaker 15:         32:43          and, uh, somebody out to do something. Uh, and so we kind of ended up being the ones to do something, uh, if I file the suit.

Speaker 14:         32:54          So they filed a suit basically saying to the federal government, you have no right to barge into our small independent local business.

Speaker 15:         33:03          That was, they can't really tell us what to do because we're not an interstate business. And that's all that the federal government regulates. And up until that point, that was all they had regulated.

Speaker 14:         33:15          The case went to the u s district court for the northern district of Alabama. Uh, at the lower court level, the three judge, special panel, uh, we had a unanimous decision in our favor. The Alabama court agreed that there was no interstate commerce happening here and that Ali's did not have to desegregate. They could sell their ribs to whoever they wanted. And we were optimistic about that. The government then appeals and the case, as they say, it goes all the way to the supreme court.

Speaker 16:         33:49          [inaudible]

Speaker 14:         33:49          all right. Let me now explain to you how the government made this argument because they made it. Yeah,

Speaker 16:         33:53          the court chief justice bad please. Carte

Speaker 2:          33:56          October 5th, 1964

Speaker 16:         33:57          second case

Speaker 2:          33:59          solicitor General Archibald Cox gets up there and lays it out. Why the government should be allowed to use the commerce clause of all things to desegregate all these barbecue

Speaker 16:         34:08          that believes operate a restaurant in Birmingham, Alabama, specializing in barbecue meat.

Speaker 2:          34:15          He says this is a business that sells and buys a lot of meat.

Speaker 16:         34:19          It's a 12 month period prior to July one 1964 yeah, pleas prices about $70,000 worth me.

Speaker 2:          34:27          $69,683 to be exact. And where do you think all that meat cake

Speaker 16:         34:32          is? That purchase from the Carmel Company at is Birmingham, Alabama. All the beat sold that. That came from other states so that it moved and then it's big. Huh?

Speaker 2:          34:46          In other words, you think you're a local business but you're not. Meat is sourced from places other than Alabama. And what about your ketchup? Hypothetically, do you grow your tomatoes in Alabama? No. Salt. Salt, not mine in Alabama. So, even though we bought it from a local vendor, that local vendor probably bought it from somebody who bought it from somebody that got it from out of state. They were reaching beyond what had ever been done before. Basically government was basically telling the McClung is the same thing they told Roscoe Philbin

Speaker 14:         35:14          you are not an island. Well, and that was only the government's first argument. They had another argument

Speaker 16:         35:23          that was a second than still bar directly.

Speaker 14:         35:26          That was even more

Speaker 16:         35:28          radical betray and racial discrimination in restaurants at interstate commerce, which is caused by the artificial narrowing of the consumer resulting from the explosion of big girl patient.

Speaker 17:         35:41          So here's the argument, okay. If you deny black people access to restaurants and hotels, you are effectively shutting down interstate travel by them. In parts of the country where this practice is commonplace, the entire deep south,

Speaker 14:         35:57          you're limiting their ability to cross state lines and and travel. The central argument says James Chen is that when you discriminate against someone, well as you create downstream negative, uh, commercial effects, like, like you create a chilling effect because the person you're discriminating against is then less likely to travel across state lines and spend money. So in effect, you are depressing their future interstate commerce.

Speaker 17:         36:29          If you ask black people with this experience from this time period, they will universally say we never left home unless every tire was triple checked. Every belt was triple checked in the car because we did not want to have the car breakdown in a hostile southern town and get lynched. Right? Right. It is an entire system of travel and commerce that's at stake here.

Speaker 14:         37:04          Essentially, the argument was discrimination is bad for business. It's expensive. And ultimately in a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court, same court, that a hundred years earlier had basically gutted the 14th amendment. The Supreme Court agreed that a discrimination in restaurants post significant burdens on the quote interstate flow of food and upon the movement of products generally. Do you remember that decision coming down? Oh, certainly. Where were you? Pause at work. Can you tell me a little bit about how you and your dad processed that decision?

Speaker 15:         37:44          We simply served anyone who came in after that no problem. And they were, uh, the very next day there was a group of local, uh, civil rights leaders who came in and ate lunch a new, some of them. Ah, I haven't seen them in the news, that sort of thing. They were not our regular customers for then, nor after, frankly, but, uh, they celebrated or whatever you want to say, uh, test it. I don't know what their motive was, but they came in and ate lunch. They got served just like anybody else. They came in and it was fine. Sure. The law was, was decided. So that was it.

Speaker 10:         38:24          Was it tense? No,

Speaker 15:         38:29          other than the waitress who was waiting on was, she was a little antsy about it.

Speaker 14:         38:34          And was it this waitress, was she a black woman?

Speaker 15:         38:36          Yes. No, I forget who it was now, but she was like, most of our employees have been there a very long time and, uh, had never served other black folks, uh, in a sit down situation. And, and of course it was a little bit, uh, I won't say upsetting but different. She was a little hesitant at first. I, you know, told her, you know, Cisco right-hand serve him and she did. And we did. And that was not a problem

Speaker 14:         39:07          after the ruling. It's not as if a lot of black customers suddenly started coming into Ollie's BBQ. They didn't really increase their blood. Here's how a guy named Nathan Turner Jr put it in 2014, uh, he was interviewed for an NPR piece. He grew up nearby. Ollie's,

Speaker 18:         39:21          just the fact that all is pushed it that far to take it to the supreme court. It left a bad taste, pun intended, in the mouths of a lot of black people in Birmingham.

Speaker 14:         39:35          Now, now 53 years later. How do you think about that Supreme Court decision?

Speaker 15:         39:42          Well, yeah, if you're asking me about segregation, that's one thing you asked me about Supreme Court and the decision and the commerce clause. I still disagree with, uh, uh, let me put it real, real succinctly. Uh, I think what you had in that decision was it rather than, and I think my civics is correct, but I don't know, rather than three quarters of the, uh, Congress and three fifths of the states, I believe it is having two or maybe two thirds of Congress, whichever it is, having to vote to repeal an amendment to the constitution. Uh, you had basically nine appointees who repeal the 10th amendment to the Constitution,

Speaker 14:         40:29          but 10th amendment basically says that the powers not given to the feds are reserved for the states and for the people.

Speaker 15:         40:35          And that's about as succinct as I can say it.

Speaker 14:         40:37          Do you understand how this is going to sound to a lot of our listeners, I mean that you are making a state's rights argument as a not so veiled way to continue to discriminate that really in the end, this is not about states' rights. I think that's going to how it's going to sound to a lot of people.

Speaker 15:         40:52          Well, it may very well, but it's not the case. Was there segregation? Yes. Uh, where we going to voluntarily, uh, in that, probably not. Would we go back and reinstate if we could? No, absolutely not. But the issue that you're talking about with the uh, commerce clause and the constitutional issue is still just what I said.

Speaker 14:         41:24          So you still believe 53 years later that the supreme court got it wrong, that they should have never used the commerce clause to make you desegregate Ollie's? Yep.

Speaker 15:         41:34          That is correct. But don't hear me say that. I don't want to go back and have segregation again. That's separate

Speaker 14:         41:40          [inaudible] issue. But is it separate I guess is my question. You know, uh, like I grant you, if you think of it in the abstract, a federal government being able to regulate commerce across all boundaries is an enormous power and in it, and it could be a scary Paris, I grant you that at the same time you have a civil rights act that it speaks to a different amendment in the constitution, right? And that you and your father were not willing to follow. So how is the government going to get you to pay attention and to get in line? They've got to use the commerce clause. So on some level isn't, it isn't the power present because the other principles that would otherwise regulate your behavior just aren't working.

Speaker 15:         42:26          Well, that's, that's the point. And you choose which, which is the priority basically.

Speaker 14:         42:36          I don't understand that. You W W which is the priority [inaudible]

Speaker 15:         42:38          how well, which is the priority of, uh, those amendments. Uh,

Speaker 14:         42:44          and so for you, the 10th amendment that grants states rights for everything not enumerated, outweighs the dignity of black people. No, no, no, no. We'll put, so say it to me differently then. Well,

Speaker 15:         43:01          the 10th amendment left that to the states, the fourth amendment. Yes. I think you meant to say the 14th amendment gives people rights, everyone rights. But here's the thing about rights and Scott, kind of like the first law of thermodynamics, there's only a, and people don't realize this a lot of times there are only so many rights and then only a finite number of rights. If you take some, give something to someone, they come from someone else or somewhere else. Now it's very well to say that the end of segregation was a higher right and more important right then the misuse of the commerce clause or whatever you want to say. But u s but there's still a balance and just which one you think is most important. Um, today's parlance, we call it zero sum

Speaker 3:          44:11          [inaudible]

Speaker 19:         44:12          Ollie's basic point. We talked about this for another hour, was it in achieving desegregation that way, and by the way, civil rights act of 64 dramatically altered the south. It desegregated huge parts of the south. But by doing it that way, he says with the commerce clause, something was, he calls it

Speaker 1:          44:32          a zero sum, I wouldn't call it that. I don't think most people would call it that. Treating people with dignity inequality is a net win period.

Speaker 10:         44:44          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          44:45          but it is legitimately strange that the government had to take such a roundabout ass backward way to fix this, to fix this grave injustice.

Speaker 6:          44:58          What, what, what you would think would be the obvious that you would go right to those civil rights parts of the constitution. But it wasn't. It was the commerce. That's weird. Is it? Yeah. We have the 14th amendment and yet we go to the commerce clause for something. Yeah. That is so clearly stated in one of the amendments. So why it will lawyers are very tricky.

Speaker 1:          45:21          This is Jamie Floyd again, by the way.

Speaker 6:          45:22          And the lawyers in those cases that want, they wanted to win, they wanted to win more than they wanted to make a social statement about equal justice, equal rights. The 14th amendment. I mean those things mattered, but most of all they wanted to win. They wanted to shut down discrimination at those lunch counters and if Congress could shut them down or require them to open their doors to all Americans using those 16 words, I'm okay with that.

Speaker 1:          45:53          Yeah. Yeah. No, I mean obviously the, if the ends do justify the means in that case, but it does make you, if you sort of put that case and the wheat case in your mind as a kind of split screen. Yeah. It's, it's a little strange because I do think, okay, we have id. I mean, hopefully we're Americans with principles that matter. You know, that we believe in equality. We believe in racial justice, but really we just believe in money and we can do all the other stuff by bootstrapping it to commerce. But somehow as, as pure principles, they what don't have

Speaker 6:          46:29          well, it's deeply troubling that we have to use commerce to achieve our higher values.

Speaker 1:          46:36          That is weird to me. That is fundamentally weird to me. And it's kind of cynical.

Speaker 6:          46:40          Well yeah, I mean I, you are right. We are at least in large part about commerce in this country, but if that's who we are, then we should embrace it and use it to our advantage. And if we can use it to our advantage, perhaps it does take us to our higher principles. Oh that's an interesting way of looking at it. Yeah. It's not all bad.

Speaker 20:         47:09          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          47:09          one of Jamie's points, which I hadn't actually thought of was that legislating morality, legislating what is good and what is bad doesn't always

Speaker 10:         47:18          go well.

Speaker 1:          47:19          Cause we very often don't agree. I mean obviously there have been times where people kept slaves and thought that was just fine.

Speaker 2:          47:28          That was right.

Speaker 6:          47:30          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          47:30          and for a hundred years you had the 14th amendment in place, but it couldn't solve Ollie's BBQ. And here was a way

Speaker 3:          47:38          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          47:39          for the government without going at the moral questions head on, government could reach its hand all the way into the barbecue joints in the hotels and the restaurants in the houses. And now the cake shops of America reach its hand all the way down into the local. And it was because of this increasingly expansive idea of commerce that was now no longer the buying and selling of things or the not buying and selling and things. It was now any behavior they could create, a kind of butterfly effect that might one day, many steps downstream have a future effect

Speaker 21:         48:20          on the bike.

Speaker 2:          48:23          So in that sense, Ollie McClung was writing his case. That was a massive shift.

Speaker 22:         48:30          It shifted totally the federal government's role beyond business. Even if you think it's good, then that's fine and it's for the better. But just ask to be realized that it was a massive shift from the way that the country had been, uh, up before that time,

Speaker 2:          48:57          after the McClung case. James Chen says service government use of the commerce clause pretty much went wild. Yeah, there was just no real limit. They began to wave those 16 words, sort of like a magic wand to pass laws on everything from fair labor standards to marijuana is a schedule one drugs gun control act of 1968 guns sped justice for victims of trafficking, sex trafficking, 19,000 African lions in the wild, dangerous species, 1992 professional and Amateur Sports Sports Protection Act, which forbids state authorized sports, gambling, all kinds of things. And in fact, the only question was whether the government even had to make the argument itself, whether the governor even has to defend itself. James Chen says there were times when the government would pass a law, it'd get taken to court and the government would basically not show up and they would still with, that's where we were. So we were arguing whether the government even has to argue. So you can see the McClung case as sort of a second big bang, but then you get to the mid nineties at this point, 1994 you have a democratic president. Bill Clinton Democratic majorities in both houses of Congress and together they pass the violence against women. Act today is the first day of Spring and I think it's appropriate that we begin a new season of hope in the fight against domestic violence. [inaudible]

Speaker 15:         50:30          I'd like you all for being here. This is an important day.

Speaker 1:          50:34          The act was sort of a sweeping rethink of the federal government's role in trying to prevent violence against women. It beefed up investigations, uh, of violent crimes against women prosecutions. It allowed women to sue their alleged attackers in federal court. [inaudible]

Speaker 15:         50:50          take responsibility. Domestic violence is now the number one health risk for women between the ages of 15 and 44 in our country.

Speaker 1:          50:58          And the law was hinged on the commerce clause. Same essential argument is in the BBQ case that same fall. My name is Christy Brown. Carla. I am 19 years old and I have lived in Fairfax, Virginia, most of my life. A woman named Christy Brown. Kala starts her freshman year at Virginia Tech and just weeks in, in mid September, 1994 I was raped by two football players in my own dorm. I had met them for the first time, just 15 minutes before they assaulted me. These two football players she alleged had raped her repeatedly on a single night. In 1984 I was raped three times. She went to the local campus authorities. She told her story, college held their own hearings, didn't go to the police. They suspended one of the two students. He appealed the other one and when he returned, Krissy Bronco dropped out of school.

Speaker 3:          51:44          Oh,

Speaker 19:         51:47          Christy Brown. Kala ultimately decides to sue her alleged attackers and the school under this new law. The violence against Women Act and the case

Speaker 1:          51:57          ultimately makes it to the Supreme Court.

Speaker 15:         52:00          We'll hear argument now. Number 99 five Kristi Brown, Kala versus Antonio Morrison

Speaker 1:          52:06          when Christie's case got to the Supreme Court, her lawyer, MR chief justice and may it please the court made the same argument about women that the government had made in the Ollie's BBQ case about black people. One of the most discrimination, or in this case outright violence has a huge downstream effect on the economy.

Speaker 6:          52:23          A bipartisan Congress concluded that gender based violence substantially affects the national economy, gender based violence, and the fear of that discriminatory violence deters women's travel interstate restricts women's choice of jobs and ability to perform those jobs, reduces national productivity and increases medical and other costs.

Speaker 1:          52:45          And again, the court was given tons of evidence about the economic effects sample congress heard from women whose batterers kept their partners from working. They're shown data that every year this costs the country billions of dollars. And that economic downstream effect was not hard to prove in this case, she dropped out. Well, especially if you aggregate it right, it's not just her, it's everyone else who similarly situated. But in this case, as I understand it, this law doesn't apply to any, any argument what's happening at a very different time in the country, very different mood and in front of an increasingly conservative supreme court that just wasn't buying it anymore. Petitioner Bruise oncologists complaint

Speaker 23:         53:26          alleges that she was the victim of a brutal assault.

Speaker 1:          53:29          This is chief justice Rehnquist reading the majority opinion.

Speaker 23:         53:32          If the allegations are true, no civilized system of justice could fail to provide her a remedy for Morrison's conduct, but gender motivated crimes of violence are not in any sense of the phrase economic activity.

Speaker 3:          53:49          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          53:49          In other words, we're very sorry for what may have happened to Christine Bronc Kala, but this is not commerce. This is violence. The suggestion was, at least in the Ali's case, there was something being bought sold here. They felt like the length of commerce was [inaudible]

Speaker 23:         54:05          too thin. We accordingly reject the argument that Congress may regulate noneconomic violent criminal conduct based solely on that conduct's remote effect on interstate commerce.

Speaker 17:         54:16          Chief Justice Rehnquist got his majority to start to chip away at the commerce power. Just a tiny, teeny, teeny weeny little bit and Jamie Floyd says that attempt to roll it back continues its rolling back. It is rolling back. It's still pretty powerful. Don't get us wrong, but where we're left at the end of the day is in a really confusing place. Ollie McClung excluding black people from his dining room. Yeah, it's a commercial act. We consider it reprehensible, but I, I would like to think that raping Christine would be at least as bad. Totally. I mean, do you see it? This is what this kind of like absurd abstraction gets us to and in a coherent ideal world can't be right.

Speaker 24:         55:23          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          55:24          I dunno when you, when the, when the, the reasoning behind something gets a little rocky than the soul of things gets, gets called into question. What are you doing? Good.

Speaker 7:          55:36          Yeah. For me, that's what happens when you make everything about money. Things get a little bit rotten at their four.

Speaker 1:          55:47          All right, so I'm gonna I just, before I, uh, before I read the credits, Robert, thank you for being a party to the [inaudible] adventure.
