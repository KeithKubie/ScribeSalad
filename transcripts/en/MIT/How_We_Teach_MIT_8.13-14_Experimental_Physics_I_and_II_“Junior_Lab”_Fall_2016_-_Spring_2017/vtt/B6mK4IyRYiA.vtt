00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.160
Well, one of the main
challenges that students coming

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.680
into this class are
facing is that for many

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.110
of them, the last time they
did an experiment in a physics

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.470
class may have been a
high school class where

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.600
the experiments were set up to
in a certain sense, just work.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.190
So they could push the
button and get the data

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.340
and then learn something about
whatever the piece of physics

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.800
that was being studied,
whether it was colliding two

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.050
carts to learn about
conservation of momentum,

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.530
or swinging a pendulum to learn
about harmonic oscillators,

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.300
something like that.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.760
Usually, the instructor
who taught them

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.860
that experiment set
it up in such a way

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.780
that the experiments
were themselves

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.660
were not the challenge.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.890
It was learning the physics.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.040
By the time students get to
their third year of the physics

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.070
major, they really know
an extraordinary amount

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.270
of physics.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.520
And that is really
a secondary goal

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.332
of what we're teaching here.

00:00:58.332 --> 00:01:00.654
Junior Lab is really about
the professional development

00:01:00.654 --> 00:01:02.820
of the student as a scientist,
and that means things

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.884
like approaching a
difficult piece of apparatus

00:01:07.884 --> 00:01:09.300
with an attitude
that you're going

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.610
to be able to get it
done, understanding

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.120
that anything you try is not
going to work the first time.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.060
You're going to
have to debug it.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.780
It's about keeping very careful
records of what you've done,

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.090
so that when you have to
go back and repeat it,

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.480
you can see what you've done.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.330
There's a large number of
things that sort of add up to,

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.860
this is the way a
professional does

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.610
it, which is different than
almost anything they've

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.810
done previously in their
career as a physics student.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.970
So one of the
great challenges is

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.240
if they think they know
how to do experiments,

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.740
they may have learned it in a
way that was a little bit more

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.260
of a novice approach before.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.810
So there may be some
things they have to unlearn

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.049
before even getting started.

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.340
And we spend about the first
month of the class working

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.430
on things like that.
