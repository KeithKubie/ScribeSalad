00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This is a supplementary unit

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
in case you've forgotten how sine and cosine and their friends work.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
You may directly skip to the quiz to check your knowledge.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Sine and cosine and their friends are about right triangles.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
This is a right triangle, a triangle that has a right angle;

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
a and b are the legs of the right triangle;

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
c is the hypotenuse.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And I'm interested in that angle, which I call beta.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Once this angle is specified, the ratio of every 2 of these sides is fixed.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
For instance, b divided by c is fixed once beta is given.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
That's called the sine of beta.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And a divided by c is given once beta is known. That's the cosine.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
If we have a different right triangle, with the same angle beta,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:11.000
you see, in this case, the leg b shrinks at the same ratio as the leg c shrinks.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So this ratio b over c stays constant.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Same for a divided by c; a shrinks, c shrinks at the same ratio,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
this ratio, a divided by c stays constant.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
It's a function of this angle beta alone.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
In daily life, you would specify beta with angular degrees:

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
45°, 90°, 180°.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000
In mathematics and in most parts of computer science, you do not use angular degrees.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
You use radians. The idea is the following:

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
You look at the unit circle, a circle of radius 1.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
If this is the angle I want to express, 90°.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I'm not using the number 90°,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
but I'm giving the length of the part of the circumference that I am cutting off here.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
The total circumference would be 2π, a circle of radius 1,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
so this would be π divided by 2.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And that's the angle in radian.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
90° becomes π divided by 2;

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
3.14 and so on, divided by 2.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
A very ugly number.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000
If I want to specify 45°, that's of course just half of that number;

00:02:38.000 --> 09:59:59.000
π divided by 4.
