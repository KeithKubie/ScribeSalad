00:00:00.324 --> 00:00:01.740
So we have another
situation where

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.871
we want to see whether these
two figures are congruent.

00:00:04.871 --> 00:00:06.370
And the way we're
going to test that

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.000
is by trying to transform
this figure by translating it,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.620
rotating it, and reflecting it.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.020
So the first thing that
might-- let me translate it.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.070
So if these two things are
congruent, looks like point E

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.080
and the point that I'm
touching right now,

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.210
those would correspond
to each other.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.430
Let me try to rotate
it a little bit.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.272
So let me rotate-- whoops, I
don't want to rotate there,

00:00:26.272 --> 00:00:28.230
I want to rotate around
point E since I already

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.300
have those on top of each other.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.510
So just like that.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:37.980
And it looks like now, if I
reflect it across that line,

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.010
I'm going to be-- oh
no, I'm not there.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.700
You see, this is tricky.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.200
See, when I reflect it, this
point, this point, this point,

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.440
and this point seem to be
in the exact same place,

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.870
but point C does not
correspond with that point

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.130
right over there.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.560
So these two polygons
are not congruent.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.790
And this is why it's
important to do this,

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.600
to make sure the
rotations work out.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.940
So these two are not congruent.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.980
I'm not able to get them to
exactly overlap each other just

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.900
through translations,
rotations, and reflections.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.930
So are these polygons congruent?

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.480
No.
