00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.440
A lot of people watch TV all day.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.040
I’d rather play video games.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.240
How long? I would say at least 50 hours a week.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.080
I try to keep a healthy balance.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.860
My bigger issue just besides the time,

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.500
was spending a lot of money,

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.340
just spending and gambling in the games.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.280
I can’t condemn a game for wanting to be addictive

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.660
because that’s the point.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.540
I’m Ahmed Shihab-Eldin

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.600
and I’ve been looking into the dark side of tech,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.660
from facial recognition to fake news.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.980
I wanted to understand how companies

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.560
design addictive games that maximize profit.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.580
The global market for games grew from $70 billion

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.760
in 2012 to $122 billion in 2017.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.640
By comparison, global box office revenue

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.260
for films in 2017 was $41 billion.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.700
So we’re in Boston at one of the biggest gaming

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.520
conventions in America,

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.360
maybe in the world. And I don’t know where to look.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.500
Gaming has gotten so big

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.640
that watching others play attracts massive crowds…

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.000
…and two-thirds of American households

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.300
now play video games,

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.160
according to the Entertainment Software Association.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.120
Do you play a lot of games still?

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.200
Yes, not as much as I used to.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.020
Why?

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.620
Time.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.440
How much would you,

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.560
when you were playing a lot of games?

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.600
I would say like 30 hours a week, at most.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.820
That’s it?

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.100
Yeah, I know, right? Gotta pump those numbers up.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.420
Those are rookie numbers.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.400
Why, do you play still?

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.320
Yeah, for sure.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.180
How long?

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.180
I would say at least 50 hours a week.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.880
Wow.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.600
Pretty much all my free time.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.420
Is it tough? Do you ever lose track of time?

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.380
Some games can definitely make you lose track of time

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.580
more than others.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.700
But it's definitely harder to balance work life,

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.160
personal life and video games.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.480
I kind of cut out the personal life part.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.840
focused more on the video games currently.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.220
Do you ever feel addicted

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.380
to these games or to one game in particular?

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.860
I don’t think so.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.940
I know when to step away because I understand

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.180
some games, they’ll make me really upset

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.020
and it’s like, okay, I need to step away

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.400
and do something else.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.060
One study estimated that nine percent of teen gamers

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.160
are addicted.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.400
With an estimated 2.6 billion people playing

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.940
video games globally, it’s not a limited issue.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.460
After I heard that the World Health Organization

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.860
was classifying gaming disorder as a mental health

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.660
condition, my reporting brought me

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.720
to a gaming rehab center near Seattle.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.100
You spent 8 weeks here?

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.260
Yeah…

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.040
So I was playing

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.660
on average between 12 and 16 hours a day.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.300
I would either be playing video games,

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.320
watching porn,

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.920
watching some show

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:56.860
or I would be sleeping. That was it.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.880
Every day?

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.500
Yeah.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.860
Jon Jones is in phase two of the program,

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.320
living in an apartment provided by Restart,

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.240
but free to roam the real world.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.080
A flip phone to start out with.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.020
Computer use would only be at corporate

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.060
in the computer lab.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.480
My main excuse of rationalizing was like,

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.860
"I'm only playing so much just because I'm depressed.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.620
If I wasn't depressed, I wouldn't be playing."

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.280
Do you think games are designed to be addictive?

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.640
Yeah and…

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.820
You didn’t even hesitate.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.100
Hilarie Cash founded reSTART

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.040
after seeing patterns related to gaming

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.060
and screen addiction.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.640
My first case was in 1994

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.500
and throughout the 90s, you know, people were coming

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.260
in for therapy…

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.040
Parents are handing their devices to their kids and

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.040
it's going to really impact their development and

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.040
prime them for addiction.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.540
Even if they're not addicted,

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.740
they're going to be primed for it.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.260
So I think it's a growing problem.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.440
The initial seven weeks of resident care at reSTART

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.800
costs nearly $30,000,

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.960
but Charlie Bracke said it changed his life.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.880
Did you feel anxious, shaky?

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.000
Very much so.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.680
There’s very, very real physical withdrawal symptoms

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.420
to video gaming.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.700
How serious of a problem is this?

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.260
I was so depressed that I started researching how to kill

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.580
myself on my phone

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:19.940
because I couldn't get up

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.700
and go to the computer to do so.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.440
There are concerns about the affect of games on kids

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.960
since nearly half of gamers are under 18,

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.340
and mostly male.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.220
And teens who spend five hours a day gaming

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.420
are 71 percent more likely to be at risk for suicide

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.500
than those who spend less than one hour per day.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.320
it just spiraled out of control

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.300
until I was gaming 16 hours a day.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.400
There are few screen rehabs,

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.820
and experts are divided on the best routes to health.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.320
At reSTART, a complete digital detox is required.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.480
I don't play games at all.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.620
If it's digital and gaming, I don't touch it,

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.120
so I don't even allow myself Sudoku

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.640
on my phone.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.920
Gaming used to be all about personal computers

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.500
and consoles. You’d buy a game outright and play it.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.640
Then smartphones came along.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.020
The gaming industry went to what's called “free to play,”

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.800
which basically you get the game

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.220
and you can play the game.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.040
That’s Bill Grosso, a gaming industry insider,

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.680
who founded Scientific Revenue to help companies

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.300
maximize payments within their games.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.160
If you think about what a really bad game is,

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.480
it's the game that is completely non-addictive.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.080
Designing a good game is inherently trying to design

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.820
something that people will want to come back to,

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.920
will feel compelled to come back to.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.340
It’s also helpful for making more money.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.780
As games transitioned to free to play,

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.320
the selling of virtual goods became crucial.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.220
By 2016, ‘Grand Theft Auto Five’

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.280
had sold more than 60 million copies,

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.760
but the free version, ‘GTA Online’

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.820
made more than $500 million

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.280
on in-game micro-transactions.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.620
My bigger issue just besides the time,

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.120
was spending a lot of money

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.260
– just spending and gambling in the games.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:02.620
I will joke about it in the games.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:03.120
Oh really?

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.900
Like, "Oh yeah, I just spent $600.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.540
Yeah, they're getting their money,

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.220
they're ripping us off."

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.060
We would joke about how they designed the games

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.620
to get you to play longer,

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.300
get you to spend more money.

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.140
Now, I get to pay too much money to open loot boxes.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.740
Loot boxes amount to a randomized purchase that may

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.560
or may not contain what you’re looking for.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.340
It's very definitely the same thing as a roulette wheel.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.880
It's very definitely aimed at the compulsion

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.340
and addiction side of the game,

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:36.980
of the human personality.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.740
I think loot boxes are straight-up gambling.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.540
It's something that keeps people coming back,

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.420
keeps people grinding in the game,

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:46.860
playing it longer and longer,

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.940
and because you can't just buy what it is you want,

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.160
you have to keep forking money over.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.180
Last year, one game company caught so much flack

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.160
for the practice that they advertised a game this year

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.940
with a simple message:

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.480
No loot boxes.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.000
Belgium declared loot boxes illegal gambling in April

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.980
and  American politicians like Senator Maggie Hassan

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:10.440
have also questioned the practice.

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.820
Do you agree that children being addicted to gaming

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.780
and activities like loot boxes

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:16.920
that might make them more

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.080
susceptible to addiction

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.220
is a problem that merits our attention?

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:24.580
So it would be 300, 400 and then it's like,

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.100
"Okay, well, I'll keep going until I get it."

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.420
And if I don't get it after a couple hundred dollars

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:34.000
then I would get really depressed

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.340
and sometimes I would just keep going.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:37.800
I already spent 400, well, I'm just going to spend

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.980
until I get it.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:41.840
Loot boxes are also one of the best ways

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.200
to pull ‘bleed whales’ dry.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.100
What is a ‘whale’?

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.440
Whale is industry terminology for someone who spends

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.220
too much, fundamentally.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.400
It's one of those really unfortunate things

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.280
in that it's really a piece of terminology

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.420
that comes from Las Vegas.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.279
Whale was casino terminology for

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.900
a really, really big spender.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.880
Bill Grosso caught flack last year

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.240
because, as his website brags, his company works to:

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:13.120
“Turn free users into paid ones and keep more whales.”

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:16.040
But during our interview, Grosso walked that claim back.

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.780
If you look at some of the coverage

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.180
of Scientific Revenue, where people have said,

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.540
"Well, they spot whales and then milk them

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:25.300
at the psychologically maximum moments."

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:26.880
There’s no truth to that.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.500
None whatsoever. We’re not that good.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.660
The claim remains on their website.

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.700
And game companies remain focused on whales.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:37.380
They'll spend 10, 20, 30 grand,

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.240
they're the people who keep the game alive

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.780
because they spend so much money.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.160
You wouldn't call yourself a whale?

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.860
No. I was more of a ‘low.’

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.340
I did spend a lot with eight grand in a year.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:50.860
That’s a lot of money.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.220
Of course, it’s not just games.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:54.700
The rewards systems built

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.440
into games are also built into our phones.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.180
And no method is off the table

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.320
in the battle for our attention.

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.080
My name is Nir Eyal. And I'm the author of a book called

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.840
“Hooked, How to Build Habit-Forming Products.”

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.260
Nir told me how to use gamification and psychology

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.840
to make apps that will keep people coming back.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.620
Every hook starts with a trigger.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.560
A trigger is something in our environment

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.800
that tells us what to do next.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.200
A ping, a ding, a ring.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.560
Some kind of notification that tells us what to do.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.920
Then the next step is the variable reward.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.360
It's some kind of uncertain outcome

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.320
that we're looking for.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:30.740
Scrolling the feed has this variable reward mechanism

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:31.720
just like pulling on a slot machine.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.120
And then, finally, the investment phase

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.440
where we put something into the product, like data,

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:40.260
followers, content, reputation, that makes the product

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.400
better and better with use.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.340
Eventually, we're using the product

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:44.740
because of an internal trigger.

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:46.800
When we're lonely, we check Facebook.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.880
When we're uncertain, we check Google.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.560
When we're bored, we might check the news.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.820
We might check stock prices or sports scores

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:54.900
to satiate that need.

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.020
Three out of four American children

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.660
have access to a smartphone

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.560
and nearly half of American parents believe their kids

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.780
are addicted to mobile devices.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.960
For now, both gaming companies and rehabs will profit,

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.780
while gaming addicts are left with few resources

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:12.640
for recovery.

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:15.620
There’s lots of evidence to support that contact

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:19.380
with nature is actually very healing and reduces anxiety,

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:22.240
and helps people concentrate,

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.380
so we have them out in nature quite a lot.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.040
What was your favorite part of being here?

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.480
I tried to diversify,

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.620
just not get caught up in one thing and focus on that.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:37.706
Most of the time was either spent with music.

00:10:37.706 --> 00:10:40.340
I started playing piano here.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.960
On Saturdays we’ll go out and hike

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.240
and do different games

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.400
I think a big part of it has been actually working on

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:53.100
the past stuff and I actually being open and vulnerable

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:55.220
and talking about emotions

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:56.960
and just recognizing my emotions.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:01.200
Being able to deal with them more,

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:06.700
but also just the, I guess, just that sense of

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:10.840
being a little sad about how much

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:11.740
time has been wasted…

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.320
Hey, it's Ahmed.

including stories about facial recognition

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:20.400
and fake news.
