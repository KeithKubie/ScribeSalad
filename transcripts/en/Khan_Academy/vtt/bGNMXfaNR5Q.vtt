00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.660
I've gotten several requests
to explain or teach the

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:05.590
mean value theorem.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.010
So let's do that in this video.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.440
So this is the mean
value theorem.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.530
And I have mixed feelings
about the mean value theorem.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.490
It's kind of neat, but what
you'll see is, it might not be

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.820
obvious to prove, but the
intuition behind it's

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:23.860
pretty obvious.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.010
And the reason I have mixed
feelings about it, is that even

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:34.130
though, as you'll hopefully
see, the intuition is pretty

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.770
obvious, but they stick it in
the math books, and people are

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.890
just trying to learn calculus,
and get to what matters, and

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.710
then they put the mean value
theorem in there, and they have

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.700
all of this function notation,
and they have all of these

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.570
words, and it just
confuses people.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.890
So hopefully this video will
clarify that little bit,

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.360
and I'm curious to see
what you think of it.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.880
So let's see.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.820
What does the mean
value theorem say?

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:54.890
Let me draw some axes.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.505
I'll do a visual
explanation first.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.340
I think this calls for magenta.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.370
So that's my x-axis.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.340
This is my y-axis.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.000
And let's say I have
some function f of x.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.040
So let me draw my f of x.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.100
That's as good as any.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.950
And this is some function f
of x, and I'm going to put

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.750
a few conditions on f of x.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:38.620
f of x has to be continuous
and differentiable.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.380
And I know a lot of you
probably get intimidated

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.270
when you hear these words.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.830
It sounds like what a
mathematician would say, and

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.420
it sounds very abstract.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.940
All continuous means is that
the curve is connected to

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.280
itself as you go along it.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.300
And here, the conditions are
over a closed interval.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.810
This is another very
mathy term you'll see.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.490
So you'll often say, on a
closed interval from a to b.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.750
All that means is an interval,
let's say a is the low point,

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.510
let's say this is a, we don't
know what number that is.

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:12.155
That could be minus
5, or who knows.

00:02:12.155 --> 00:02:17.020
And let's say this is b, right
here, let me b right here.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.080
Let's say that's be.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.720
So when people talk about a
closed interval, defined on a

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.360
closed interval, that means
that the function needs to be

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.460
defined at every number between
a and b, and the function needs

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.250
to be defined at a and at b.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.930
If they said over an open
interval between a and b, that

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.180
means that it's only defined at
every value between a and b,

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.160
but not necessarily at a and b.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.030
So it has to be continuous,
differentiable, and let's say

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.790
it's defined over the closed
interval, and this is just

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.480
the notation for it, a b.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.660
So that means, it has to be
defined at all of the x values

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.250
from a to b, including a and b.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.660
If it was an open interval,
you would write it like this.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.720
You'd write a and b.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.350
That means an interval for all
the numbers between a and

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.060
b, but not including those.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.580
So let's ignore that for now.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.400
So back to the mean
value theorem.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.060
So you know, hopefully,
what continuous means.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.350
Let me draw here a function
that's not continuous.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.620
So a function that is
not continuous would

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.590
look like this.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.320
It would go like this,
and it would start up

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.180
here, go like that.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.490
Right?

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.430
So this would be an example
of a function, let's say,

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.581
same axes, let me draw
it in a different color.

00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:35.560
If that was our y-- no,
that's not a good.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.440
If that was our y-axis, and
that was our x-axis, just to

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.800
give you the reference
for what I drew.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.470
So if the function is
continuous, continuous,

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.560
continuous, and then it jumps,
that disconnect, that

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.240
would make this function
discontinuous, or it would not

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.720
be a continuous function.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.670
So a function just has
to be continuous.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.770
And now what does
differentiable mean?

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.950
Differentiable means that at
every point over the interval

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.940
that we care about, you have to
be able to find the derivative.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.610
That means you can take
the derivative of it.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.030
It's a differentiable.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.050
And what else does that mean?

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.150
Well, that means that if you
were to graph the derivative

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.460
of this function, that
it is also continuous.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.240
And I'll let you think
about that for a second.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.905
And actually, in this video I'm
going to show you an example of

00:04:16.905 --> 00:04:22.700
a function that is continuous,
but not differentiable and

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.020
because of that, the mean
value theorem breaks down.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.900
But anyway, let's get back
to the mean value theorem.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.120
Most of the functions we
deal with satisfy all

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.210
three of these things.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.290
Unless, you know, you're doing
limit problems, and they try to

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:35.960
make these things break down.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:36.990
Anyway, back to the function.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.560
So this function meets all
of these requirements.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.830
So all it says is, if I were
take the average slope

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.120
between point a and point b.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.800
So what is the slope, the
average slope between

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.450
point a and point b?

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:54.060
Well, slope is just
rise over run, right?

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.610
So what is it?

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.810
Let me see if I can draw
the average slope.

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:04.700
So the run would
be this distance.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.565
That'd be the run, right,
and this would be the rise.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.630
So this is the point,
right here, that's

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.270
the point a, f of a.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:23.450
Over here, this is
the point b, f of b.

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.270
So what's the average
slope between a and b?

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.240
Well, it's rise over run.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.190
So what's the rise?

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.510
What's this distance?

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.630
How much have we gone up
from f of a to f of b?

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:40.100
Well, the rise will
just be f of b, this

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:45.640
height, minus f of a.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:50.190
f of b minus f of a.

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.960
And what's the run,
what's this distance?

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.530
Well, it's just b minus a.

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.430
And if I were to draw a line
that has that average slope, it

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.890
would look something like this.

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.690
We could make it go through
those two points, but it

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.750
really doesn't have to.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.130
Let me do it in a blue.

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.640
So that's the average
slope between those

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.090
two points, right?

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.030
So what does the mean
value theorem tell us?

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.690
It says, if f of x is defined
over this closed interval from

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.960
a to b, and f of x is
continuous, and it's

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.750
differentiable, that you could
take the derivative at any

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:45.560
point, that there must be some
points c f prime of c is

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.350
equal to this thing.

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.740
So is equal to f prime of c.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.330
I shouldn't have
written it here.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:53.820
So what is that telling us?

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.140
So all that's telling us,
is if we're continuous,

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:00.000
differentiable, defined over
the closed interval, that

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.890
there's some point c, oh, and c
has to be between a and b,

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:07.550
there's some point between a
and b, and it could be at one

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:11.540
of the points, but there's some
point c where the derivative at

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:16.390
c, or the slope at c, the
instantaneous slope at c, is

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:19.700
exactly equal to the average
slope over that interval.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.090
So what does that mean?

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:22.950
So we can look at it visually.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:27.790
Is there any point along this
curve where the slope looks

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:31.850
very similar to this average
slope that we calculated?

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:33.030
Well, sure, let's see.

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:37.010
It looks like, maybe,
this point, right here?

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:37.650
Just the way I drew it.

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:40.320
This is very inexact.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.520
But that point looks like the
slope, you know, I could

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.060
say the slope is something
like that, right there.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.970
So we don't know what,
analytically, this function is,

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:53.280
but visually, you could see
that at this point c, the

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:57.220
derivative, so I just
picked that point.

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:00.160
So this could be our point c.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.220
And how do we just say that?

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:05.360
Well, because f prime of c is
this slope, and it's equal

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.610
to the average slope.

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:10.190
So f prime of c is this thing,
and it's going to be equal to

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:12.460
the average slope over
the whole thing.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:15.230
And this curve actually
probably has another point

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:17.950
where the slope is equal
to the average slope.

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:18.210
Let's see.

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:21.360
This one looks, like,
right around there.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.710
Just the way I drew it.

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.460
Looks like the slope there
could look something like,

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.110
could be parallel as well.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:31.000
These lines should be parallel.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.040
The tangent lines
should be parallel.

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.630
So hopefully that makes
a little sense to you.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:41.170
Another way to think about it
is that your average, actually,

00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:45.450
let me draw a graph just
to make sure that we

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:47.620
hit the point home.

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:50.870
Let's draw my position
as a function of time.

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:53.630
So this is something,
this'll make it applicable

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:55.000
to the real world.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.610
So that's my x-axis, or
the time axis, that's

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:00.270
my position axis.

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:03.140
This is going back to our
original intuition of what

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.470
even a derivative is.

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:09.720
So this is time, and I call
this position, or distance,

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.050
or it doesn't matter.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:12.490
Position.

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:15.910
And if I was moving at a
constant velocity, my position

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:19.190
as a function of time would
just be a straight line, right?

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:21.050
And the velocity is
actually your slope.

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:22.590
But let's say I had
a varying velocity.

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:25.910
And in reality, if you're
driving a car, you are always

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:27.640
at a variable velocity.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:31.770
So let's say I start at a
standstill at time t equals 0,

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:39.810
and then I accelerate, then I
decelerate a little bit,

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:43.150
decelerate a little bit, I keep
decelerating, and then I come

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.860
to a standstill, so my
position stays still.

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:49.920
Then I accelerate
again, decelerate,

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.450
accelerate, et cetera.

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:53.080
Right?

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:57.145
So this could be, you know, I
have a variable velocity, and

00:09:57.145 --> 00:09:59.500
this could be my position
as a function of time.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:04.390
So all this says, let's
say that after, this

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:05.900
is time 0, position 0.

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:10.920
Let's say after 1 hour, let's
say that is 1 hour, this time

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:16.685
equals 1 hour, let's say
I have gone 60 miles.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:21.710
So what can you say?

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:29.160
You could say that my average
velocity equals just change in

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.370
distance divided by
change in times.

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:33.700
It equals 60 miles per hour.

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:40.950
So what the mean values
theorem says, is OK.

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.780
Your average velocity, so you
could almost view it as the

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:47.430
average slope between this
point and this point with 60,

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:51.410
if your average velocity was 60
miles per hour, there was some

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:54.950
point in time, maybe more, but
there was at least one point in

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:58.290
time, where you were going
exactly sixty miles per hour.

00:10:58.290 --> 00:10:59.590
That make sense, right?

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:02.030
If you average 60 miles per
hour, maybe you're going 40

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:03.880
miles per hour some of the
point, but at some point you

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.440
went 80, and in between you had
to be going 60 miles per hour.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.300
So let me see if I can
draw that graphically.

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:14.683
So this slope is my average
velocity, and the way I drew

00:11:14.683 --> 00:11:17.110
it, there's probably two
points, let's see, probably

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:21.050
right around here, I was
probably going 60 miles per

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:23.380
hour, the slope is probably
60 there, the instantaneous

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:29.100
velocity probably
there, as well.

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.710
So before I leave, let's do
this analytically, just

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:36.010
to work with numbers.

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:38.280
And the reason why I have mixed
feelings about the mean value

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:42.040
theorem, it's useful later on,
probably if you become a math

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:46.670
major you'll maybe use it to
prove some theorems, or maybe

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:48.290
you'll prove it, itself.

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:50.390
But if you're just applying
calculus for the most part,

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:51.900
you're not going to be
using the mean value

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:52.610
theorem too much.

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:54.200
But anyway, if you've got to
know it, you've got to know it,

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.720
and it tells you something else
about the world, so it's

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.450
interesting that way.

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:04.680
So let's say we have the
function f of x is equal to x

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:09.210
squared minus 4x, and the
interval that I care about

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:12.880
here is between, is a closed
interval, so I'm including

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.880
2, from 2 to 4.

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:19.200
Now, the mean value theorem
tells us that if this

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.050
function is defined on this
interval, and it is, right?

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:23.380
We could put any number.

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.180
The domain of this is actually
all real numbers, I could put

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:29.050
any number here, so obviously
it's going to be defined

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:30.990
over this interval.

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:34.140
But so it's defined over the
interval, this is continuous,

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:34.870
this is differentiable.

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:36.160
You could take the derivative,
and the derivative

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.380
is continuous.

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.810
So the mean value theorem
should apply here.

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:42.960
So let's see what value of
c is equal to the average

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.400
slope between 2 and 4.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.700
So what's the average
slope between 2 and 4?

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:52.780
Well, it's going to be f of 4,
so the change in the function,

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:59.900
f of 4 minus f of 2 divided by
the change in x, so 4 minus 2.

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:01.460
So this equal to
the average slope.

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:06.800
So f of 4 is 16
minus 16, right?

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:07.800
So that's 0.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:08.370
Let me make sure of that.

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:12.740
4 times 4, 16, minus 4
times 4, 16, right.

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:14.560
Minus f of 2.

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:19.500
f of 2 is 2 squared,
is 4, right, and then

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.730
minus 4 times 2.

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:23.630
So minus 8.

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:29.390
All of that over 2.

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:31.060
And so this equals minus 4.

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.120
So this equals 4 over 2.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:36.700
So the average slope from
x is equal to 2 to x

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:39.420
is equal to 4 is 2.

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:42.350
And now the mean value theorem
tells us, that there must be

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:45.670
some point that's between these
two, maybe including one of

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:50.340
those, where the slope at that
point is exactly equal to 2.

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:51.900
Let's figure out
what point that is.

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:53.390
That c.

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:55.720
Let's take the derivative,
because the derivative at c

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:56.620
is going to be equal to 2.

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:57.690
So we just take the derivative.

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:04.110
So let's say f prime of x
is equal to 2x minus four.

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:08.990
And we want to figure out, at
what x value does this equal 2.

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:09.600
So we say,

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.460
2x minus 4 is equal to 2.

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:16.030
Where does the slope equal 2?

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:24.000
And you get 2x is equal
to 6, x is equal to 3.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.880
So if x is equal to 3, the
derivative is exactly equal

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:28.630
to the average slope.

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:30.990
But let me see if I can,
let me get the graphing

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:33.540
calculator here.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.910
Let me what I can do.

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:38.980
OK.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:43.090
So here's the graph of
x squared minus 4x.

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:44.600
Let me see if I can make
it a little bit bigger.

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:52.050
The interval that we care
about is from here to here.

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:55.910
So the average slope over
that interval was 2.

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:59.010
So if we were to draw the
slope, it was like that, the

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:00.900
slope would look like that.

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:04.930
And at the point 3, the
slope is exactly 2.

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:07.540
So let me actually draw that.

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:11.320
This isn't too hard
to draw, for myself.

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.540
Let me see.

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:21.270
So if that's the x-axis, I'll
want that graph out of the way.

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:22.160
That's the y-axis.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:28.820
So the graph goes through
the point 0, 0 as

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:31.010
neatly as possible.

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:31.990
Nope, that's not neat.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:40.610
So the graph goes something
like this, it dips up, then it

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:43.610
goes like that, and actually
it keeps going straight up,

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:45.660
like that, it's a parabola.

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:47.620
So this is point 4.

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:51.210
The point 2 is here.

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:56.150
And at 2 we're at negative
4, so the vertex is at

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:57.710
the point 2, minus four.

00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:01.390
So what we said, the average
slope, so the closed interval

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:04.280
that we care about, between 2
and 4, it's from 2

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:05.960
here to 4 here.

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:09.160
That's the interval, 2 to 4.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.850
The average slope is 2.

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:14.570
Doesn't look like it, only
because I've kind of

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:17.010
compressed the y-axis.

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:20.090
And we're saying, at the point
x is equal to 3, the slope

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:22.010
is equal to exactly that.

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:25.180
So at x is equal to three,
the slope is equal

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:26.860
to the same thing.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.620
That's all the mean
value theorem is.

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:29.840
I know sounds complicated.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.810
People talk about continuity,
and differentiability, and f

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:36.520
prime of c, and all this, but
all it says is, there's some

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:41.020
point between these two points
where the instantaneous slope,

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:43.690
or slope exactly at that
point, is equal to the slope

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:45.510
between these two points.

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:47.650
Hope I didn't confuse you.
