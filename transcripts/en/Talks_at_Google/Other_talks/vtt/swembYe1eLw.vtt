MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK:
Hi everybody.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:03.650
Hear me OK?

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:05.770
OK, so I think we're
going to get going.

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.920
My name's Michael Weiss-Malik.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.770
Our guest today,
Jonathan Kuniholm.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.480
I met him in we think 2007--
as far as we can piece back

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.720
together-- at a
SciFoo conference

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.380
and he had some pretty cool
tech that he was demoing.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.390
Some open source robotics
stuff related to prosthetics.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.380
And I was impressed
enough that I said,

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.020
hey you should come and give
a talk at Google some time.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.240
And he took that to heart and
about four or five years later

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.800
emailed me and said, hey you
offered that talk at Google,

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.670
now would be a great time.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.000
So so we're hosting him today.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.640
Jonathan is the president and
founder of the open prosthetics

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.530
project.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.670
He's also a founder of
StumpworX, a startup that

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.987
focuses on prosthetic
technology.

00:00:49.987 --> 00:00:52.320
He's also presidential appointee
to the National Council

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.810
on Disability.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.250
And the stuff he has
to say is pretty cool.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.751
So please put your
hands together

00:00:57.751 --> 00:00:58.750
and help me welcome Jon.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.230
 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.900
JON KUNIHOLM: Thanks
very much, Michael.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.630
Let me first just
offer a disclaimer

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.140
with respect to my
government job--

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.760
they encourage us to do this--
that everything that I'm

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.890
going to say today
are my personal views

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.770
and not reflective of any
position of the government.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.610
 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.110
So what I would like
to talk about today

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:36.760
is how we can design good
design to solve problems

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.480
that society has for
the most part neglected.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.290
And I came across
one of those problems

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.200
personally after I
lost my arm in 2005

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.310
and discovered that
prosthetic arms were

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.620
an orphan medical device.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.220
And in thinking
a little bit more

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.610
about why prosthetic arms lagged
so far behind other technology

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.350
that we use every day,
I started to realize

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.720
that prosthetic arms and
orphan medical devices

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.040
are part of a larger
group of those problems

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.310
that society has
tended to neglect,

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.590
which can be solved by
something that we're beginning

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.480
to call public interest design.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.300
And the question that I'd really
like to talk about today--

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.040
and I would actually
like it to be

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.610
the beginning of a discussion
because it's something that

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.170
by no means I claim to
have even begun to solve--

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.510
is, how can we marshal
all of the tools

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.510
at our disposal to trying to
better solve those problems.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.130
Because very much now I believe
that most of those problems

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.020
are solved in kind
of a haphazard way.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.600
Government funded projects,
philanthropy, side

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.240
projects from industry.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.960
You name the way that people
happen upon these issues

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.210
and try to solve them,
but in general you

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:18.010
can be sure that the resources
and attention that we devote

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.680
toward solving these
underserved needs

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.690
are going to lag far
behind those problems which

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.210
are very obvious from every
other standpoint need solving.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.340
Very profitable things.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.500
There was no question
that cell phone technology

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.600
was going to improve over the
last 10 years, for example.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:47.140
So in the summer of 2005 I
took leave from graduate school

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.650
at Duke University and I was
deployed as a marine to Iraq

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:53.540
in Anbar Province.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.560
 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.350
And I was the platoon commander
for an engineer position of 50

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:07.180
Marines and we were doing
mostly what everybody

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.770
was doing over there, which
was sustainment and stability

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:15.460
operations, patrolling, guarding
convoys, that sort of thing.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:22.380
On New Year's day of 2005
I was on a foot patrol

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.205
that was ambushed by
improvised explosive device.

00:04:26.205 --> 00:04:29.640
 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.180
The blast took off
most of my forearm

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.510
and I found myself back
in the States and learning

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.280
about prosthetic arm technology.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.430
 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.890
I managed to get
myself back to school

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.650
and get involved with a
research project sponsored

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.110
by DARPA called the
Revolutionizing Prosthetics

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.280
2009 Project.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.240
It was one of two that
DARPA was funding.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.930
Which is really the first
serious prosthetic arm research

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.560
effort that had occurred
in the United States

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.530
since-- there was a
small one in the '70s--

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.320
but really since World War II.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:19.420
 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.170
The goal was a
really ambitious one.

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:28.270
The goal was to create--
in four years, in 2007--

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.320
an arm using commercially
available technology

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.910
that could go to market
in that year, in 2007.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.840
And then more
ambitiously to create

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.260
an arm that had more
degrees of freedom,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.840
was fully in neurally
integrated-- so

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.920
nearly the same articulation
as a native human arm--

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.445
and full strength.

00:05:49.445 --> 00:05:52.340
 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.340
An incredibly ambitious project.

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.030
What I think it's
important to understand

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.750
there's been an enormous--
and this picture

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.450
is up here not too bag
that I was on 60 Minutes,

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:08.590
but to show the
kind of attention

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.940
to that these projects got.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.960
For whatever reason,
prosthetic arms

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.960
tend to really capture
the popular imagination.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.360
People love robotics.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.480
They love thinking about the
barriers, the singularity

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.850
and the barriers between man
and machine disappearing.

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.850
It becomes a vehicle for
all kinds of philosophical

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.380
and science fiction interest.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:38.210
I think the takeaway about
these projects, which

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.070
is important to
remember is first of all

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:47.840
that despite the amazing things
that both of these research

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:53.380
efforts accomplished,
we still have not--

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:57.810
more than 10 years since the
war began in Afghanistan,

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:02.220
actually pushing 15
now-- still do not

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:05.730
have any commercially
available device that's

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:10.640
resulted from any of this
government funded research.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.090
We're still waiting
for the first one.

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.420
It has remained, as always,
just around the corner.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:23.152
And I'm told that we're waiting
on FDA approval for the DECA RP

00:07:23.152 --> 00:07:27.190
'07 project to
receive FDA approval.

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.950
And it has been
some clinical trials

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.560
but we still haven't
seen a device.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.800
The other one is
I think that it's

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:39.330
important to understand-- it's
my belief that we have a media

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:40.770
bias.

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:44.310
It's not a political
conservative media bias,

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.230
but it's one towards
entertainment.

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:50.640
And so the word
bionic is used a lot,

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.250
the words dexterous
and manipulation

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:58.290
are also used a lot, which
have very specific meanings

00:07:58.290 --> 00:07:59.120
in robotics.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:07.620
 

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.590
There are some caveats
that I could give.

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:15.190
You could call a trigger
grip for example,

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:18.350
where one part of
the hand is grasping

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:22.000
a handle of a cordless
drill and the finger is

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.220
pulling the trigger.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:27.960
That tends toward
sort of manipulation.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.350
It's at least a compound grasp.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:30.766
For one part of
your hand is doing

00:08:30.766 --> 00:08:32.220
one thing and one doing another.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:37.549
Of course the slide that
I'm showing here right now

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:42.860
gives you some insight into what
the human hands are capable of.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.270
This pair of hands
is doing a card trick

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:50.860
where four cuts of the
deck are being controlled

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.370
by different parts
of the two hands

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:54.780
and it's a dynamic movement.

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:57.880
 

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:02.800
I guarantee you that there isn't
a robotic hand of any kind that

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.040
could do these card
tricks right now.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:10.410
But based on the popular
press presentation of all this

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:13.090
you would think that it can.

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:16.000
You would think that
these problems are solved.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.690
So while I think it's important
to acknowledge the strides that

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:23.040
were made by these
research projects,

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.830
it's also very
important to understand

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:26.150
that we are not there yet.

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:31.700
And we do not have
bionic people.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:36.700
And these hands are for
the most part right now,

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:40.440
I think that it would be fair
to say, at least in terms

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:45.780
of prosthetic control that even
these highly articulated hands

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:48.090
are really only
capable of grasping.

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:50.530
And the difference between
grasping and manipulation I

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:55.130
think you can use a
Rubik's cube to illustrate.

00:09:55.130 --> 00:10:00.400
Manipulation is a speed
cuber solving a Rubik's cube

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:06.030
in a few minutes and
grasping is not dropping it.

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:08.690
And grasping a Rubik's
cube is actually something

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:12.360
that I can do with
the hook that I

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:15.440
wear when I do wear
a prosthetic arm.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.080
Which is the Dorrance
5x named after the guy

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.840
who patented in 1912.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:28.620
And you can see that since
then it's evolved a little bit.

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:34.230
There's some rubber grip on
the fingers a cigarette notch--

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:38.000
and I think it's
called a pen notch now.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.680
But this remains
despite everything

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:45.730
that's happened the most
used prosthetic terminal

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:47.360
device in America.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.540
And were you to go to the
Myoelectric conference

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:56.330
in New Brunswick in Canada this
August it would be a fair bet

00:10:56.330 --> 00:11:00.220
to make that the majority
of amputees attending

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.410
the conference-- at least
the ones who weren't paid

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:04.860
to be there by a
prosthetic company--

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.920
would be wearing
one of these devices

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:10.430
and not any of the
robotic prosthetic hands

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:11.820
that are available.

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:14.280
The other thing that's
important to note about this

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:17.920
is that there's another
choice which actually beats

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.940
all of them, which is the
one that I'm wearing today,

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:23.890
which is nothing.

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:28.170
About half of all arm
amputees choose most times not

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:29.470
to wear prosthesis at all.

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:31.990
And it's mostly because
of weight and comfort

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:34.520
in suspension and I'm going to
talk about that a little bit

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:35.020
later.

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:45.970
 

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:48.990
Now why is all of that?

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:55.590
This is by no means an
attack on any the folks

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:58.880
who were generous enough
to fund that project

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.810
and try to make some progress.

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:03.430
The real problem is that
they're there simply

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:06.500
isn't a market for these things.

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:11.280
The market for powered arms
it is just barely noise

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.990
compared to these
other large markets.

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:17.450
And even though the government
has accomplished quite a bit

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:19.670
in some of these
research projects, what

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:23.930
we call the valley of death,
which is the bridge that one

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:28.020
of these products must cross
in order to get from the lab

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:31.740
into becoming a clinical
product is really significant.

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:40.395
And without a market to
drive further funding,

00:12:40.395 --> 00:12:43.500
that gap-- which is estimated
by people in the industry

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:47.600
to be something like
90% of the R&amp;D remaining

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.750
on a medical product once a
proof of principal device is

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:55.470
finished-- there's just simply
nowhere for those resources

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:57.560
to come from and make it happen.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:00.350
 

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:03.260
Correspondingly,
the amount of effort

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.500
that's actually put into
solving this problem

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.760
is also very small.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:13.340
Compared to-- I cherry picked
a few really large government

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:16.150
sponsored engineering projects.

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:20.260
Some of which have been compared
to this DARPA prosthetics

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.580
project.

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:24.640
This is all in 2006 dollars.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.730
The Manhattan Project
comes in over $20 billion,

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:33.080
the moon race over $120 billion,
and just the R&amp;D for the Joint

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.660
Strike Fighter at
over $40 billion.

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:42.800
And so the $100 million, while
more than anybody had spent on

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:48.220
and on prosthetic arms in half
a century, the DARPA spend

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.870
is basically just
noise compared to this.

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:57.660
And I would argue that the
task that they set out to solve

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:01.204
rivals some of these in
terms of the engineering

00:14:01.204 --> 00:14:01.870
effort required.

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:08.800
I mean it's a small project and
it and instead of a large one.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:15.080
But nevertheless an enormous
portion of our brains,

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:21.190
for example, is devoted to
the control of our hands

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:21.927
in manipulation.

00:14:21.927 --> 00:14:23.302
I don't know if
you all have ever

00:14:23.302 --> 00:14:24.968
seen-- I don't have
a slide of it here--

00:14:24.968 --> 00:14:28.870
but the homunculus that neural
researchers use to represent.

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:33.300
They take a human figure and
adjust him proportionally

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:35.260
based on the number
of nerve endings

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:36.550
in some studies of the brain.

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:41.210
So this little figure has
gigantic lips, gigantic hands,

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:44.720
and depending on whether you're
looking at the censored version

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.980
or not, gigantic
genitalia, reflecting

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:48.530
how much of our
brains are devoted

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:52.090
to control these
parts of our body.

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:55.370
And this is true both in
terms of motor control

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:57.490
and sensory control,
it works both ways.

00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:01.800
And as you can see from that
slide of the card trick,

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.130
feedback-- sensory
feedback-- is certainly

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:09.850
a huge part of our hands
being able to do what we do.

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:17.390
So what we have is
a three-way market

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:21.340
failure to solve this problem.

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:26.500
Industry, government, and
academia all doing their parts

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.950
but all unable to
solve this problem.

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:33.970
 

00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:36.540
But of course it's
completely understandable

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:39.990
and that's why we
call prosthetic arms

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:40.970
an orphan device.

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:50.950
The orphan drug law that was
passed in 1983 defined patients

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:57.030
in need of a drug as
being medical orphans

00:15:57.030 --> 00:16:02.240
of their patient population
was less than 250,000.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.690
So prosthetic arms
in the United States

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:07.750
are about a couple
years ago, 43,000.

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:11.280
So fewer than 50,000 patients
in the United States.

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:17.170
That's a sixth of the maximum
threshold for being an orphan.

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:21.920
Of course the orphan drug law
covers pharmaceuticals and not

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:22.720
medical devices.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:27.670
So we don't have a companion
regulation or law or anything

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:31.330
that covers the creation
of medical devices.

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:35.060
And another peculiarity
of course of that,

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:39.620
is how we pay for medical
devices in the United States.

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:43.470
And get to that will get
to that a little bit later.

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:47.690
So as I mentioned before,
all of these medical orphans

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:54.760
and the NIH-- and this includes
all of the orphan drug patient

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:58.160
populations and others--
the NIH lists something

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:01.430
like 10,000 orphaned
conditions on its website.

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:05.500
And because I happened to be
interested in prosthetic arms

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:10.160
I searched for limb
absence, arm absence, and so

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.280
in my particular
orphan condition

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:15.099
is actually not one of the ones
that's listed on that site.

00:17:15.099 --> 00:17:19.800
So I would say there
are probably more.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:24.250
So the question is-- and
this gets back to the graphs

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:27.040
that I showed before--
because there's obviously

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.720
no market for it, it doesn't
necessarily make sense.

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:33.180
I wouldn't argue for example,
that it's a travesty that DARPA

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:37.590
didn't invest $100 billion into
solving this prosthetic arm

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:40.080
problem, because
the same could be

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.770
said for any of
these other orphans.

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:44.477
We simply can't
afford to do that

00:17:44.477 --> 00:17:45.810
from a public health standpoint.

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:48.960
It's just not an effective
way to spend our resources.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.630
So nevertheless,
feeling like this

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:55.130
is a problem that we'd
like for society to solve

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:58.560
and that it's not
the only one, this

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:02.750
is the question-- how can
we attack these problems

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:04.260
and solve some of them?

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.980
And it's clear that
we probably need

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:11.130
to think about them a little bit
different way than we are now.

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:13.810
My friend Chuck
Messer described this

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:16.480
as using your geek
powers for good.

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:21.140
The Cooper Hewitt Design
Museum in referencing

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:25.420
the 90% of the world it doesn't
benefit from our consumer

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:28.060
culture, they had a design
exhibit several years ago

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:33.060
called Designed For The Other
90% in reference to that.

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:37.840
There's another movement here
in the Bay Area for example,

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:42.050
you have a designer, an engineer
named Ralph Hotchkiss who makes

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:44.780
a wheelchair Whirlwind
Wheelchair is

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:45.900
in their organization .

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.890
They make appropriate
technology.

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:54.260
Wheelchairs that have larger
balloon tires on the front

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:57.970
to deal with uneven terrain
and broken sidewalks

00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:59.710
that you're more
likely to encounter,

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:02.594
if there are sidewalks all in
a lot of the developing world.

00:19:02.594 --> 00:19:04.260
And they have kind
of a cool model where

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:10.380
they try to set up factories
as profitable businesses

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:13.130
of social enterprise to
manufacture this wheelchair

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:16.440
design in the area where
they might be used.

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:21.080
And this in contrast
to sometimes

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.260
what gets done in a
wheelchair space for example,

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:28.909
is to send a kind of
rickety hospital wheelchair

00:19:28.909 --> 00:19:29.950
over to that environment.

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:32.730
Where it lasts, like a lot of
medical technology over there,

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:35.790
about 10 minutes before it
breaks and then somebody

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:37.800
has trouble finding
a part to fix it,

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.050
and it ends up getting junked.

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:43.670
 

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:47.010
Whereas I'm arguing
that prosthetic arm

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:50.450
users in the United States
are an underserved population,

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:53.040
they're not disadvantaged,
certainly to the same degree

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:56.690
that patients of the
developing world are.

00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:59.640
But all of these
patients are underserved

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:03.260
in some way or another.

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.700
So a good phrase
that's been used

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:10.270
to describe all of these
problems and the design

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:12.060
that we can use to
try to attack them,

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:13.950
is Public Interest Design.

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:15.490
Design in the public interest.

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:18.590
And so really what
I'd like to talk

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:22.350
about is, what are the
ways besides-- we'll

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:25.580
start off with government
sponsored research

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:29.330
because that's a lot of
what's happening currently.

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:32.500
What is our whole
quiver of tools

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.540
that we might use to try to
solve some of these problems?

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:38.310
 

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:39.310
Yeah, sorry about that.

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:42.950
 

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:45.300
What are the collection
of tools that we

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:48.050
could use to try to better
solve these problems?

00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:50.460
And I, like lots of
people do, I think

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:55.330
I'll probably come down on there
being some combination of all

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:57.490
of these that are necessary.

00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:00.720
But just to brush over
them all-- to begin with,

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:03.810
government sponsored research
and commercialization.

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:08.860
Then DIY and the maker culture.

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:11.600
Potentially an orphan
device law to serve

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:15.320
as a companion to
the orphan drug law

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:19.300
that we've had in this
country since 1983.

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:22.670
And then what other
regulatory or policy changes

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:27.610
might be made under
our existing structure,

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:31.289
but by program managers
who fund for example,

00:21:31.289 --> 00:21:33.080
some of this government
sponsored research.

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:39.190
What things might they
do to try to raise

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:41.490
the impact of the
research funding

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:43.370
that they're
currently giving out?

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:46.740
And then secondly what can
we do in the private sector?

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:50.840
Are there ways that folks
in the private sector

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:52.690
might be able to
contribute in ways

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:56.820
that don't impact
their own bottom line?

00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:59.780
And they can in a
potentially even

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:07.710
have a win-win in serving
these underserved folks.

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:13.110
So to start off
with, these are icons

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:15.910
that represent the three
major engineering research

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:18.860
efforts that I showed
the funding levels for.

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:22.470
The moonshot, the atomic bomb,
and the Joint Strike Fighter.

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:26.700
And it's certainly clear
that there are some problems

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:30.510
that government has
to solve, if they're

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:32.470
going to get solved for us.

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:37.330
While we do have SpaceX in
a commercial space effort

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:41.940
right now, it only exists
because the government

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:43.850
is choosing to create
that capability

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:46.269
in the fundings coming
from the government.

00:22:46.269 --> 00:22:47.810
So that's an example
actually of sort

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:50.320
of spreading the stuff
around a little bit.

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:56.220
But it was clear that
sending a man to the moon

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:59.160
or building the bomb,
however you feel about

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:02.200
that having done, these were
certainly projects they would

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:06.640
never have happened had not one
of the largest and wealthiest

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:08.390
governments in the
world decided that they

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:09.650
were going to make it happen.

00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:14.800
And they happen because in
at least two in these cases--

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.860
the first two that I
mentioned-- the results were

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:19.050
non-negotiable.

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:22.970
We were going to get to the
moon no matter how much it costs

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:26.250
and how dangerous it was.

00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:31.090
Those who are in charge of the
bomb viewed it as a response

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:37.150
to an existential threat and
that failure was not an option.

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:41.140
The government probably
would have spent anything

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:46.120
to achieve these ends.

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:51.370
Now a lot of times some
of these very programs

00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:54.080
and the other basic science
research that the government

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:59.450
does are cited as having
intangible benefits that

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:02.410
spin off, that we
would be without

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:07.700
were it not for
these other efforts.

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:10.120
So Tang, Teflon, and
Velcro are three.

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:12.110
And there's actually
a myth-busting page

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:14.820
on NASA's website that I
have up there on the slide.

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:18.300
It says that in fact, none
of these three products

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:21.280
were created by NASA or
NASA-funded research.

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:25.420
Although the space program did
take advantage of all of those.

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:27.960
While they used Tang,
Teflon, and Velcro,

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.380
they did not create it.

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:34.560
And I would argue
that even if they had,

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.160
building upon sending
somebody the moon

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:41.950
or building a high
tech fighter jet,

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:44.070
are not the most efficient
ways to create things

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:46.100
like Tang, Teflon, and Velcro.

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:50.620
So if what you want
is a prosthetic arm

00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:56.640
or to put somebody on the moon
or to build a fighter jet,

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.110
that is what you do.

00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:01.300
 

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:03.640
This really comes
down to the difference

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:07.050
between engineering
and basic science.

00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:10.740
So the point is that
whatever efforts there

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:12.760
are that are devoted to
solving this problem,

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:16.390
it really needs to be dedicated
to solving the problem.

00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:18.950
And there needs to be
some agreement on actually

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:21.160
what the problem is.

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:27.720
A significant component at
least the four-year DARPA effort

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:31.035
was based on the creation of a
neural brain-machine interface.

00:25:31.035 --> 00:25:35.530
 

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:38.235
While in the long term
it's certainly true

00:25:38.235 --> 00:25:41.750
that that represents
potentially a holy grail

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:46.150
of prosthetic arms,
it's not clear

00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:50.000
that is a necessary
component of it.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.870
Particularly given the
state of technology

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:55.330
that most people
are using every day.

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:58.660
 

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:05.680
So I was, at the time when
I met Michael in 2007,

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:09.600
we had a version
of this hardware

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:13.310
that we were showing
at Google SciFoo.

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:18.090
Tim Hanson is now
post-doc at UCSF,

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:21.230
and he created when he
was at the Nicolelis lab

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:24.620
at Duke University the signal
processing board, which

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:32.920
is capable of processing
16 EMG electromyogram

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.820
signals from the
surface of the skin that

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:37.130
can detect muscle movements.

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:39.830
And we designed it to have as
many interfaces as possible

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:42.940
because our goal
in this DIY space

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:45.810
was to try to encourage
experimentation

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:48.960
and to try to benefit
from the maker

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:52.135
culture and the huge
video game industry.

00:26:52.135 --> 00:26:55.090
 

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:59.770
And hope that some of
those resources and efforts

00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:02.850
and interest could rub off
and make some improvements

00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:04.960
in prosthetic arms.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:08.520
What we learned is
sort of the downside

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:14.060
to DIY maker and
open source culture,

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:18.060
was that these projects
sometimes require-- well first

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:21.890
they can't be done
completely without resources.

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:24.960
And then secondly,
there's activation energy

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:28.170
to any kind of a
collaborative effort, which

00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:32.464
if you don't cross you have
a lot of difficulty making

00:27:32.464 --> 00:27:33.130
anything happen.

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:35.140
So this project to still alive.

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:38.800
I looked they were
commits this week.

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:42.520
 

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:44.180
But all of those
as far as I'm aware

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:48.240
are coming from the two
labs at UCSF and Duke

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.900
that are using the hardware.

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:54.380
So the schematics-- all
this is open source and GPL

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:59.180
to the extent that it
actually applies to all of it.

00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:03.590
The schematics are up there,
all of the masks, the firmware

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:05.120
for the board,
everything is there.

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:08.400
But as far as I'm aware, nobody
has actually made one of these

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.180
except for those
two labs that are

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:13.640
using it and active
contributors.

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:15.660
Tim made a pretty
complicated board.

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:20.490
It's like six layers and has
these tiny little vias and some

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:23.110
'04 components on it.

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:28.120
We made this thing in a toaster
and had some horrible moments

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:30.720
where somebody
breathed on and then

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:34.250
you can't tell what and of those
things are anymore, et cetera.

00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:38.420
So as far as I know nobody
from the larger DIY or maker

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:41.240
culture has participated
in this project.

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:43.950
Now there's also there's another
part of the project-- we have

00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:49.780
functioning pattern recognition
software in MATLAB which is not

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:52.850
open source, and again
this is another barrier.

00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:57.180
In order to use the open source
software that we have up there

00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:59.100
you need to have
access to something

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:02.320
like $20,000 worth
of MATLAB tool boxes.

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:06.860
Which you're only going to have
if you're in industry or you're

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:08.220
in academia somewhere.

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:10.530
So these again are
some of the barriers.

00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:14.140
 

00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:19.170
Beyond that, this hasn't really
had the impact that we really

00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:21.730
hoped that it would
have when we started.

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:25.440
Although I'm certainly
proud we tried

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:29.049
and it's a pretty cool
piece of hardware.

00:29:29.049 --> 00:29:29.840
Here's another one.

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:32.420
We had a little project on
the open prosthetics project

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:35.490
to recreate a
prosthetic hook that

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:41.930
was designed in the '20s which
has been out of production

00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:45.800
for something like
35 or 40 years.

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:49.480
And most of the guys--
and it is mostly

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:53.860
guys-- who use this hook
are 80, 90 years old

00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:55.410
and they live in the Midwest.

00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:59.080
I think there are some
demographic peculiarities

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:00.890
about where this
thing was prescribed,

00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:02.620
or what people
wanted to use it for.

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:05.830
And I still get calls from
people who find-- very few,

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:10.750
it's a trickle-- who find this
thing on the web and want one.

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:15.740
You can see here this is a
picture somebody-- [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:20.684
put this in the
Thingiverse and I

00:30:20.684 --> 00:30:22.600
got bunches of people
who wanted to volunteer.

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:25.080
They were offering to print
as many of these things

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:28.720
as they could on their first
generation MakerBots-- which

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:32.850
is where I think this
printed hook came from--

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:33.720
to help the project.

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:40.430
But unfortunately, even the
latest generation MakerBot 2,

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:44.360
which I have and
really enjoy, it

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.510
doesn't print in
a material that's

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:49.980
appropriate for actual use.

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:51.850
At least in this design.

00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:56.270
This is made to be a metal hook.

00:30:56.270 --> 00:31:00.650
And you can see that the
resolution is really not

00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:02.770
fantastic there.

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:05.970
What we discovered, that
one in the lower right

00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:08.880
was printed using
selective laser sintering,

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:11.090
a rapid prototyping process.

00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:14.160
And we had some tolerance
problems with that one

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:19.210
until the service bureau
actually printed the thing out

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:23.141
on a plate and then
machined off the plate.

00:31:23.141 --> 00:31:27.180
The two jaws of the hook did
not fit together so we have

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:32.330
something like more than
50,000ths off on that thing.

00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:34.580
And I bring this up
just to point out

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:37.630
the limitations of
some of these things.

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:41.990
 

00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:47.406
Just to loop back for a moment
to the breathless enthusiasm

00:31:47.406 --> 00:31:49.030
of the press for a
lot of these things.

00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:50.770
I can't tell you the
number of stories

00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:53.530
that I've seen in
the last two years

00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:57.770
about a high school
student who has 3D printed

00:31:57.770 --> 00:32:02.040
a prosthetic hand that is
supposedly better than you pick

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:04.980
the price point of
some commercially

00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:07.770
available prosthetic hand.

00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:13.360
There's really no scrutiny at
all that's applied to these

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:14.510
claims .

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:16.890
Very often there are
completely externally powered

00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:24.270
like motors with strings or
maybe they're not even powered.

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:28.160
In any case, nobody really
closely examines the claim

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:33.290
that some kid has bested
a $40,000 prosthetic

00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:35.810
hand in his bedroom
with a RepRap machine.

00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:39.680
 

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:43.087
While I consider
myself to be a part of,

00:32:43.087 --> 00:32:44.670
and I fully embrace
the maker culture,

00:32:44.670 --> 00:32:48.400
I think we also need to be
very realistic about what we've

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:50.970
actually accomplished
and try not

00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:54.680
to run victory laps before
we've actually done it.

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:58.520
And I and I think that this
probably is one of those cases.

00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:01.720
Now that the happy
ending to this story

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:04.980
is that there actually is
a prosthetic company called

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:05.480
ToughWare.

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:09.310
 

00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:12.780
They re-engineered this and
fixed some of the problems

00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:15.745
that we had actually identified
with the original design.

00:33:15.745 --> 00:33:17.120
I think you could
actually see it

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:22.420
in the-- that's an original hook
from many decades ago up there.

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:26.030
And you can see the
places it's been welded.

00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:30.730
And so this company fixed
some of the problems

00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:33.640
and where these
things were breaking.

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:36.380
I do believe that
you can actually now

00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:41.450
purchase a version of this
hook commercially again.

00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:44.960
I consider that to
be a success even

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.810
if we weren't the
ones who did it.

00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:49.710
 

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:54.840
So lastly and then there
is some bleed across here--

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:59.570
Michael did reference the
company that I've started.

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:02.700
I also decided to
back up a little bit

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:07.610
and solve one of the problems
about prosthetic arms that

00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:10.969
may be in fact the most vexing
and least addressed, which

00:34:10.969 --> 00:34:12.765
is how we attach them
to people's bodies.

00:34:12.765 --> 00:34:15.580
 

00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:19.520
This is traditionally done with
a hard carbon fiber or glass

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:27.250
socket, a rubber liner and
maybe a plastic socket there.

00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:30.650
And I would liken a
lot of these designs

00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:34.040
to wearing wooden
shoes and rubber socks.

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:37.489
And it does pretty horrible
things to your skin

00:34:37.489 --> 00:34:40.610
when there's moisture
and friction involved.

00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:44.190
And heat, moisture, weight,
and perceived weight

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:47.190
is really related to
all of these things,

00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:50.027
because people will tolerate
hanging less off of your body

00:34:50.027 --> 00:34:51.360
when it doesn't really fit well.

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:55.090
It feels like it's heavier
if it's uncomfortable.

00:34:55.090 --> 00:35:00.180
So we decided that
the way to solve this

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:02.800
was to go back to what
prosthetic arms used

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.660
to be like in the
'40s before the VA did

00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:08.310
all the research that created
these composite sockets

00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:12.800
and consider making prosthetic
sockets more like shoes.

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.634
Like athletic shoes.

00:35:14.634 --> 00:35:16.550
Prosthetic sockets used
to be made of leather,

00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:19.325
and I've been told
by old guys who

00:35:19.325 --> 00:35:20.700
wear leather
sockets that they're

00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:22.000
the most comfortable
thing in the world

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.860
and they would never
wear anything else.

00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:26.111
But you can't find anybody
to make one of these things

00:35:26.111 --> 00:35:27.943
now, because they're
really labor intensive.

00:35:27.943 --> 00:35:29.980
And the VA actually do a
whole bunch of research

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:34.024
in the '40s trying to figure
out how to make them not stink.

00:35:34.024 --> 00:35:35.565
Because they're
basically like shoes.

00:35:35.565 --> 00:35:38.700
 

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:42.240
So we now have a pending
research proposal

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:46.110
that we should hear
from the army and DARPA

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:53.260
from any day now to use current
athletic shoe technology to try

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:57.110
to make a flexible, variable
compliance socket that's

00:35:57.110 --> 00:36:00.320
stiff in some places
and flexible and others,

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.230
breakable everywhere.

00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:04.390
That basically solves
all the same problems

00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:06.990
that your running shoes do.

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:10.360
And this would address
the number one reason

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:13.320
that people abandon
prosthetic arms.

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:17.100
And that by the way,
actually includes,

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:20.040
for example one
of the DARPA arms

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:25.530
that was tested in VA clinics
among transradial patients

00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:27.760
like me.

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:31.460
Comfort was actually
one of the major reasons

00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:34.410
that I think about
half of those patients

00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:36.840
said that they might not
be interested in having

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:37.800
one of those new arms.

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:40.490
So if we solve that
problem, then we

00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:43.650
could potentially make a lot
of the other technology more

00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:45.120
effective, because
will be better

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:46.570
at attaching people's bodies.

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:50.030
So that's what we're
up to right now.

00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:51.530
An orphan device law.

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:55.480
So at the time that the orphan
drug law was passed in 1983,

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:59.950
we had a bipartisan Congress.

00:36:59.950 --> 00:37:05.380
And I think that to imagine
in the current legislative

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:12.540
environment we can get anything
done may be overoptimistic.

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:15.980
Although perhaps
in an ideal world,

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:21.785
we would consider a law that
could increase innovation

00:37:21.785 --> 00:37:24.520
and competition in this space.

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:28.140
Now for those of you who
are unfamiliar with it,

00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:30.330
what the orphan
drug law does, is

00:37:30.330 --> 00:37:35.650
it extends exclusivity
for a drug company

00:37:35.650 --> 00:37:39.760
who's developed
a product but who

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:42.920
believes that the
further investment

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:46.730
necessary to actually bring
a proven drug to market

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:50.830
is not worth the investment
because their patent--

00:37:50.830 --> 00:37:53.300
the exclusivity available to
them on their original patents

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:53.800
has expired.

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:57.420
Drug development is often
a really long process

00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:03.760
and it's a race against the
sun down on the patents.

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:06.630
Now unfortunately,
I'm not convinced

00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:12.290
that a similar model in the
even much smaller orphan device

00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:13.730
spaces would
actually do anything.

00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:19.500
Because exclusivity in
prosthetic arm patents is often

00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:22.561
abandoned when
people decide to stop

00:38:22.561 --> 00:38:24.810
paying the maintenance on
their prosthetic arm patents

00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:26.690
after seven or 15 years.

00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:29.950
So they're leaving exclusivity
on the table with regard

00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:31.820
to patents in this
space already,

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:34.630
so would extending it
actually do anything?

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:36.010
And I'm not convinced it would.

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:56.060
 

00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:58.865
So since we're not miked in
the audience, the question is--

00:38:58.865 --> 00:39:03.230
is the approval process for
medical devices, prosthetic arm

00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:08.909
specifically similarly
long as it is for drugs?

00:39:08.909 --> 00:39:10.450
That's sort of a
complicated question

00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:13.165
because it depends on
which class of devices

00:39:13.165 --> 00:39:14.040
you're talking about.

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:18.060
The FDA has three classes of
medical devices, one, two,

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:19.846
and three.

00:39:19.846 --> 00:39:25.790
The DARPA neural-sensing
system would

00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:28.540
be a class three medical
device because it actually

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:31.190
involves an internal implant.

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:36.100
Most prosthetic devices
right now are class one.

00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:38.780
And they're not only class
one, they're class one exempt.

00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:41.238
Which means that they are exempt
from-- there are something

00:39:41.238 --> 00:39:44.080
like seven or eight requirements
for class one devices.

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:48.090
And all but three
of those are ignored

00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:53.120
for this group of class
one exempt devices.

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:56.890
So in fact and
this is something,

00:39:56.890 --> 00:40:01.330
actually that
there's been some--

00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:03.990
some of the folks who've been
pursuing these new things have

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:06.040
been assuming, and
they may be right,

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:09.680
that the FDA is seeking
to regulate prosthetic arm

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:13.175
stuff more rigorously than
they have in the past.

00:40:13.175 --> 00:40:17.600
 

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:21.910
There are articulated
myoelectric hands

00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:28.944
that have been brought to
market in the last five years

00:40:28.944 --> 00:40:30.110
that were brought to market.

00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:32.574
All you have to do basically
is announced to the FDA

00:40:32.574 --> 00:40:34.990
that you're going to start
selling these things and do it.

00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:37.573
And if you're going to test it
you just stamp it experimental,

00:40:37.573 --> 00:40:39.930
and you're good to go.

00:40:39.930 --> 00:40:44.490
But nobody wants to invest
hundreds of millions of dollars

00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:46.440
in the creation of a
device unless they're

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:49.190
sure that they're going
to get away with that.

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:51.670
And the FDA had
been making noises

00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:53.470
that they were going
to try to bump up

00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:55.620
the classification of
some of these things.

00:40:55.620 --> 00:41:01.620
And they also have a requirement
for orthopedic devices,

00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:02.710
which is reasonable.

00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:06.690
It's based on-- so a screw
in an orthopedic implant

00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:09.900
is a class one device that's
a component of a class three

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:11.700
device, which is the implant.

00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:16.540
And there was a bad
failure in the '80s because

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:19.890
of the changing of
these class one devices.

00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:24.350
And so the FDA requires that
each class one component

00:41:24.350 --> 00:41:27.356
be separately recertified
with the class three system.

00:41:27.356 --> 00:41:29.480
And if somebody did something
like that for example

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:35.670
with-- say there's a bolt
that can go through your skin

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:38.880
into the bone, it's called
osteointegration, a titanium

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:39.620
bolt.

00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:43.530
And the bolt of course
is a class three device

00:41:43.530 --> 00:41:47.040
because it goes inside the body.

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:51.540
And if they required you
to separately certify

00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:54.670
every prosthetic hand
or foot that you attach

00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:57.150
to one of these systems,
it would effectively

00:41:57.150 --> 00:41:59.000
mean that there
wouldn't be available

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.840
because nobody would
bother to do it.

00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:03.750
 

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:06.750
So actually you bring
up a really great point,

00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:09.790
which is that the FDA is a
really important part of this.

00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:14.650
And some orphan device law, a
hypothetical orphan device law

00:42:14.650 --> 00:42:19.450
or revisions of regulations that
might really impact the space

00:42:19.450 --> 00:42:23.140
should try to remove
some of those barriers

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:26.350
that actually the
FDA could potentially

00:42:26.350 --> 00:42:29.760
create in trying to
better protect us.

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:33.700
And then there are humanitarian
exemptions available.

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:35.760
And so this is
something that I think

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:37.980
there's further consideration.

00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:39.730
So that leads into
the next group

00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:42.380
of things which are
beyond new law, what

00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:45.900
about the interpretation of
existing laws and regulations.

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:51.430
The Bayh-Dole act
is the law from 1980

00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:52.980
that governs the
government funded

00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:54.529
creation of
intellectual property.

00:42:54.529 --> 00:42:57.070
And the part that most of us
are familiar with if you've ever

00:42:57.070 --> 00:42:59.153
received a government grant
is that the government

00:42:59.153 --> 00:43:02.400
has royalty free, nonexclusive
license to anything

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:04.740
that they pay you to create.

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:08.010
But then in order to
encourage economic activity,

00:43:08.010 --> 00:43:12.560
anybody who creates the
stuff has the permission

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:15.650
to go off and license it,
do whatever they want,

00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:18.100
exploit that intellectual
property on their own,

00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:20.790
as long as they don't
charge any royalties back

00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:22.170
to the government.

00:43:22.170 --> 00:43:24.220
In practice I think some
of this actually goes on

00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:26.630
because if they
fund-- particularly

00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:29.420
weapon systems and stuff
like that-- it's not

00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:32.550
like they segment off what
the intellectual property

00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:33.380
component is.

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:36.480
It's not like anybody else can
make some of these fighter jets

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:38.940
or tanks or whatever.

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:42.390
So the least popular
provision of this law what are

00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:43.951
called march-in rights.

00:43:43.951 --> 00:43:45.700
Which means that if
the government-- there

00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:48.620
are four criteria that could
be met where the government can

00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:52.580
come in and say,
you are not making

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:54.925
use of this intellectual
property the way

00:43:54.925 --> 00:43:57.050
we intended you to, we're
going to take it from you

00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:58.258
and give it to somebody else.

00:43:58.258 --> 00:44:00.780
 

00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:06.710
It has been exercised
very few times, if ever,

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:10.100
and it's a very popular-- as
you could imagine-- provision

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:12.990
with people who could get a
lot of government funding.

00:44:12.990 --> 00:44:14.031
How much time do we have?

00:44:14.031 --> 00:44:17.620
 

00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:26.880
So while this law
exists it is something

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:31.730
that could be made use of
that's on the books already.

00:44:31.730 --> 00:44:37.100
Program managers could
say, OK it's been 15 years,

00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:40.740
you haven't-- you created
a product where we're going

00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:43.750
to find somebody who will,
because our goal is to bring

00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:45.600
something like this to market.

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:47.530
And another one that
I referenced earlier

00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:50.710
is the Center for Medicare
and Medicaid Services.

00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:54.560
So all these devices and many
medical devices are like this,

00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:59.550
are reimbursed as durable
medical equipment--

00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:04.140
canes, walkers, CPAP machines,
and prosthetic devices.

00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:05.910
And the weirdness
that this creates

00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:07.850
is that the whole
cost of supporting

00:45:07.850 --> 00:45:09.800
the device for something
like five years

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:12.240
in between replacements,
has to be captured just

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:15.320
in the provision of the product
at the beginning of its life

00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:15.916
cycle.

00:45:15.916 --> 00:45:17.540
All of the appointments
and everything.

00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:21.760
So a prosthetist needs
to be able to to function

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:22.630
based on that.

00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:24.904
The other thing that's
weird about this

00:45:24.904 --> 00:45:26.820
is that there's a perverse
incentive of course

00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:29.150
to provide more
up these products.

00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:34.305
Because if you give
somebody a myoelectric arm,

00:45:34.305 --> 00:45:44.070
it reimburses at $35,000 a
body-powered arm may be $8000.

00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:46.680
And the other thing is that the
way that these reimbursement

00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:49.740
codes are created is that a
company has to demonstrate

00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:52.550
efficacy, and then
they petition CMS.

00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:55.060
 

00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:57.812
So that they have to basically
outlay all of the R&amp;D

00:45:57.812 --> 00:45:59.770
ahead, before they know
if they're going to get

00:45:59.770 --> 00:46:00.310
reimbursed.

00:46:00.310 --> 00:46:04.370
There have been some
recent cases where people

00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:07.770
get the wrong answer back from
CMS and it kills the company.

00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:10.600
A good example is
the iBot wheelchair

00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:13.440
which everybody agrees is
pretty impressive technology.

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:16.530
That came back as being
excluded to a very

00:46:16.530 --> 00:46:21.490
few pretty serious
disabilities and not

00:46:21.490 --> 00:46:25.540
reimbursable at a rate that
could sustain its manufacturer

00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:28.080
and the company's
closed its doors.

00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:29.560
And so it's actually
up in the air

00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:31.601
what's going to happen to
add to that technology.

00:46:31.601 --> 00:46:34.140
Hopefully DEKA, which
is the creator of it,

00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:36.800
will figure something out.

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:39.610
So one thing I think
people might do

00:46:39.610 --> 00:46:43.200
would be to create incentives
in reimbursement codes.

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:46.370
You could create a code
for the performance

00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:49.130
of a particular device without
knowing that it existed.

00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:54.600
So I could say a 15 degree
of freedom prosthetic hand

00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:57.450
and wrist that's capable
of all these performance

00:46:57.450 --> 00:47:00.760
criteria will reimburse
at this rate-- $150,000

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:02.010
or whatever it is.

00:47:02.010 --> 00:47:05.480
And then company would
know ahead of time

00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:07.610
that they have a
payday ahead of them

00:47:07.610 --> 00:47:09.830
if they're capable of
meeting the criteria.

00:47:09.830 --> 00:47:14.110
And so it would be much more
clear that this is possible.

00:47:14.110 --> 00:47:18.730
Then, contract language,
there's a bunch of open source

00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:23.850
and open architecture language
that-- the Navy for one,

00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:26.250
still has a kind of dead
website that's still up there--

00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:29.320
but it's sample program
manager language

00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:32.310
to put in RFPs to
ensure that you

00:47:32.310 --> 00:47:36.520
can get what you
want out of them.

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:38.470
And those are tools
that could be used.

00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:41.510
And then lastly the DARPA
has made really good use

00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:44.590
of challenges and contests.

00:47:44.590 --> 00:47:48.450
And I think the sort of thing
in partnership with industry

00:47:48.450 --> 00:47:50.520
might be very helpful.

00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:53.030
So I guess in some sense, in
my graphic here of somebody

00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:54.620
cutting red tape,
maybe I'm actually

00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:57.180
talking about creating
some more in some cases.

00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:59.630
But you get the picture.

00:47:59.630 --> 00:48:03.160
So what about industry?

00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:07.530
And that's guys here at Google.

00:48:07.530 --> 00:48:11.280
I think that Google has done
some really creative things

00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:15.040
in terms of business model in
creating great products that

00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:18.570
solve problems in ways
that people hadn't before.

00:48:18.570 --> 00:48:22.250
And by focusing
the business model

00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:24.960
in sort of unexpected
parts of it.

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:29.997
And so I think both the Android
operating system and Gmail

00:48:29.997 --> 00:48:31.080
are good examples of that.

00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:34.120
And a recent acquisition of
yours the nest company that

00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:40.750
makes these thermostats and
the smoke detector-- those

00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:44.540
are examples of products
where people would have said,

00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:47.190
these are commodities,
you can't improve on this.

00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:49.410
It is what it is and
everybody has to have one,

00:48:49.410 --> 00:48:51.740
and you're going to buy
the $8.95 one instead

00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:55.920
of the $9.95 one because it just
does whatever it needs to do.

00:48:55.920 --> 00:49:01.570
And I think the way that
company was able to really pay

00:49:01.570 --> 00:49:07.980
attention to consumers
represents creative thinking

00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:10.130
which is the way that
probably everybody needs

00:49:10.130 --> 00:49:13.120
to attack challenging markets.

00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:17.720
And these ones I've talked about
are certainly some of them.

00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:20.080
So you guys have
also been in the news

00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:24.850
recently for-- by my
count something like nine,

00:49:24.850 --> 00:49:27.120
counting the drone company--
robotic acquisitions

00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:29.550
over the last year or so.

00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:31.890
And one of these
is Redwood robotics

00:49:31.890 --> 00:49:36.440
which I think involves a part
of a Willow Garage spin-off.

00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:38.480
And I looked a
little bit, I'd never

00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:41.060
seen this hand picture before.

00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:42.570
It looks to me like a rendering.

00:49:42.570 --> 00:49:45.540
I don't know if it
represents a real product.

00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:51.480
I think that it's interesting
that in terms of a manipulation

00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:55.020
and terminal device
a hand acquisition

00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:59.100
that you guys chose to
acquire Redwood and not in any

00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:03.750
of the companies that
were involved in the DARPA

00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:04.630
prosthetic arms.

00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:10.210
There's an interesting
companionship

00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:15.520
between robot teleoperation
and prosthetics.

00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:21.790
Myron Diftler, who runs the
Robonaut program for NASA

00:50:21.790 --> 00:50:26.090
at Johnson Space Center said,
that when he thought about it,

00:50:26.090 --> 00:50:29.630
the prosthetic
problem is basically

00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:31.400
a teleoperation problem.

00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:33.880
You just happen to be
attached to the device you're

00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:35.230
trying to teleoperate.

00:50:35.230 --> 00:50:39.480
So in some sense, when you
take away video latency

00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:44.680
to the moon or whatever, the
prosthetic control problem

00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:47.920
might be in some sense easier.

00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:51.710
Although the way that
these things are usually

00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:57.590
performed right now is with
sort of a haptic armature.

00:50:57.590 --> 00:51:00.060
And in the prosthetic
case, obviously you're

00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:02.590
trying to control a
limb that's absent,

00:51:02.590 --> 00:51:05.740
so you don't have
access to those fingers

00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:07.870
to tell those digits
where to move.

00:51:07.870 --> 00:51:10.760
Anyway, my point
in bringing this up

00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:15.280
is that there is some
great companionship

00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:17.864
to these problems.

00:51:17.864 --> 00:51:23.760
And in fact while it is
not clear right now who

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:27.210
in America is ready to buy, for
example, a personal assistance

00:51:27.210 --> 00:51:31.920
robot, or some other things that
one might imagine as products

00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:36.000
that could come out of companies
like these down the road,

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:39.104
there are prosthetic
customers who can,

00:51:39.104 --> 00:51:41.020
according to the current
reimbursement system,

00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:46.350
in some cases pay in
excess of $100,000 for one

00:51:46.350 --> 00:51:47.530
of these devices.

00:51:47.530 --> 00:51:52.550
So it might be possible to
create a synergy of interest

00:51:52.550 --> 00:51:58.290
where you're solving problems
for the future of home

00:51:58.290 --> 00:52:01.560
and mass produced robotics.

00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:05.410
At the same time as you are
serving prosthetic customers

00:52:05.410 --> 00:52:08.810
in the near term, even
though they don't represent

00:52:08.810 --> 00:52:11.270
the huge revenue
stream that we all

00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:16.425
would if everybody has a Jetsons
style maid in their home.

00:52:16.425 --> 00:52:19.550
 

00:52:19.550 --> 00:52:22.660
This is a picture
of my friend Kevin

00:52:22.660 --> 00:52:27.770
who was born without
both of his legs.

00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:29.900
I threw his picture
up there because he

00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:34.100
is in some ways represents
an orphan of an even

00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:36.490
smaller community than my own.

00:52:36.490 --> 00:52:40.480
Without any hip joints, when
he was about 10 years old

00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:42.770
they tried to put
prosthetic legs on him

00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:46.230
and they weren't really
anything but another couple

00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:49.590
of extra crutches for him
to sort of haul around.

00:52:49.590 --> 00:52:52.542
And he very quickly decided
that he wanted no part of that,

00:52:52.542 --> 00:52:54.000
and he gets around
on a skateboard.

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.740
 

00:52:56.740 --> 00:53:01.430
Now that said, if you
were to envision--

00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:04.430
and that's a way to
stay active too--

00:53:04.430 --> 00:53:07.910
but if you were to envision a
robotic prosthetic device that

00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:10.120
might help him, it
could look something

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:15.150
like Boston Robotics--
Boston Dynamics,

00:53:15.150 --> 00:53:18.720
I forget the name of the
company in Cambridge--

00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:21.770
they have the big dog walking
bot and those others where they

00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:27.620
pretty famously kick
them over in the video.

00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:32.690
A pair of those walking likes
controlled like the Segway is,

00:53:32.690 --> 00:53:41.440
by leaning, could do pretty
fair bit towards replacing legs.

00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:45.010
And so that's sort
of another case where

00:53:45.010 --> 00:53:47.650
one of these robotics
companies might

00:53:47.650 --> 00:53:50.860
hold in currently
available technology

00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:56.260
the keys to making a
change in somebody's life.

00:53:56.260 --> 00:54:01.060
My hope in mentioning
industry-- and I think again,

00:54:01.060 --> 00:54:05.120
none of these are
mutually exclusive-- I

00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:09.590
do believe that the only
way that we are going

00:54:09.590 --> 00:54:12.760
to solve these extremely
vexing problems to society

00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:16.100
is by throwing nearly
everything that we have at it

00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:18.650
and seeing what sticks.

00:54:18.650 --> 00:54:22.580
And so really my purpose
in talking to you

00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:27.800
today is I want to start this
conversation because it's

00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:31.439
pretty clear to me that there
are some things that we could

00:54:31.439 --> 00:54:33.730
do better about how we're
responding to these problems,

00:54:33.730 --> 00:54:40.280
and I'd very much like some help
in figuring out how to do it.

00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:44.180
I used up more time than I'd
intended to, but if y'all have

00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:47.900
any questions I'd certainly
like to try and answer them.

00:54:47.900 --> 00:55:05.000
 

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.880
So the question is, I mentioned
that most arm amputees still

00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:13.970
use hooks via the
more complicated

00:55:13.970 --> 00:55:19.360
electrical externally
powered prostheses, and why.

00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:21.460
I think cost is part of it.

00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:24.200
The Affordable Care Act
has changed some of that.

00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:33.240
Before January, a lot of
people with medical insurance

00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:39.400
had lifetime caps of-- in some
cases like $1,500 lifetime cap

00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:41.650
on prosthetics
services-- which isn't

00:55:41.650 --> 00:55:45.060
even enough to get
a single prosthesis.

00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:50.750
And beyond the
expansion of coverage,

00:55:50.750 --> 00:55:53.170
the removal of
the lifetime caps,

00:55:53.170 --> 00:55:59.452
and pre-existing
conditions are huge

00:55:59.452 --> 00:56:00.660
for the prosthetic community.

00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:04.760
So to the extent
that it is monetary,

00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:08.420
the Affordable Care should
change some of that.

00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:11.450
 

00:56:11.450 --> 00:56:17.180
Anecdotally, I don't think
there's any great data on this,

00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:23.060
but I think a lot
of common complaints

00:56:23.060 --> 00:56:26.420
about the myoelectric
prostheses are

00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:33.520
latency, unintended movements,
the speed with which the motors

00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:37.370
move the weight, and then
I think you hit on it--

00:56:37.370 --> 00:56:41.630
function is probably
the primary reason.

00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:48.260
The hook has been famously
described in Ted talks

00:56:48.260 --> 00:56:51.790
as a rubber band and a
hook on the end of a stick.

00:56:51.790 --> 00:56:54.420
But I believe the
bar is actually

00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:55.630
quite a bit higher than that.

00:56:55.630 --> 00:56:59.190
The Dorrance hook is really
kind of a marvel of design.

00:56:59.190 --> 00:57:02.760
It's got a bunch of affordances
kind of built into it.

00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:05.330
You could pick something
up, use it as a hook.

00:57:05.330 --> 00:57:07.680
And then as a split
hook you can open it up

00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:10.470
and use the individual
fingers for different things.

00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:15.830
The little thumb that
has the cable on it--

00:57:15.830 --> 00:57:21.820
put that back up-- the little
thumb that has the cable on it

00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:24.820
can be used to
push things, and is

00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:29.430
the part of the
device that's used

00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:31.330
to wedge a knife and a fork.

00:57:31.330 --> 00:57:33.550
Actually that's a
perfect example,

00:57:33.550 --> 00:57:36.840
is eating with a
knife and a fork.

00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:40.996
With cosmetic coverings
on the myoelectric hands

00:57:40.996 --> 00:57:42.370
they tend to be
slippery and it's

00:57:42.370 --> 00:57:46.720
hard to get a knife and a
fork to set securely in them.

00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:49.070
And this thing is designed
to do exactly that.

00:57:49.070 --> 00:57:51.060
It's got a chiseled
tang in the middle

00:57:51.060 --> 00:57:54.670
so you can stick
a tool in there.

00:57:54.670 --> 00:57:56.450
Or you could wedge
either a knife or fork

00:57:56.450 --> 00:57:59.620
in between the fingers
and over the thumb.

00:57:59.620 --> 00:58:02.250
So I think function
is a lot of it.

00:58:02.250 --> 00:58:05.280
 

00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:06.790
Any other questions?

00:58:06.790 --> 00:58:10.900
 

00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:11.400
Yeah.

00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:23.100
 

00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:23.600
Yeah.

00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:26.400
So, well first of all,
it's selfish of me, right?

00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:27.940
That's my problem
so that's what I

00:58:27.940 --> 00:58:30.190
spend a lot of time
thinking about.

00:58:30.190 --> 00:58:34.230
But there are other
complications.

00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:38.680
So there are something like
50 times more leg amputees

00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:43.720
in America than arm amputees
because of peripheral vascular

00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:45.365
disease secondary to diabetes.

00:58:45.365 --> 00:58:48.120
 

00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:50.560
And that's the major
cause of leg amputation.

00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:54.170
So there are more than
two million leg amputees

00:58:54.170 --> 00:58:56.620
in America.

00:58:56.620 --> 00:58:58.716
And it's an easier
problem to solve too.

00:58:58.716 --> 00:59:02.390
 

00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:04.280
Well, Oscar Pistorius
is a great example.

00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:07.820
The cheetah legs make somebody
capable of running close

00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:10.920
to a 10 second hundred.

00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:12.980
Although knees are a problem.

00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:18.010
And Oscar Pistorius is
a below-knee amputee.

00:59:18.010 --> 00:59:21.040
But then among the
powered devices,

00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:23.290
control engineers
who work on legs

00:59:23.290 --> 00:59:27.700
have told me that it's possible
to do reasonable approximations

00:59:27.700 --> 00:59:31.360
of gait with the individual
components not even talking

00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:32.700
to each other.

00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:35.350
Where they just respond to
the external forces and they

00:59:35.350 --> 00:59:39.010
are capable of doing a
pretty good job walking.

00:59:39.010 --> 00:59:43.260
And contrast that to
an arm where just--

00:59:43.260 --> 00:59:45.470
forget the manipulation
stuff-- just

00:59:45.470 --> 00:59:47.860
reach to grasp with a
whole arm for somebody

00:59:47.860 --> 00:59:50.570
up to the shoulder level
involves the coordination

00:59:50.570 --> 00:59:52.920
of all of the joints together.

00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:57.640
So I like to say that if you
imagine that these are legs,

00:59:57.640 --> 01:00:00.490
the arm problem has five of
them on the end of a sixth

01:00:00.490 --> 01:00:02.440
and they all have to
dance together in order

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:04.630
to do the most basic task
that an arm has to do.

01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:07.250
 

01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:09.270
Yeah and so the
economics are-- I

01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:13.040
mean legs are a lot
bigger business.

01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:16.090
So there is a real incentive.

01:00:16.090 --> 01:00:19.860
Although there are
some new leg companies

01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:26.710
that because of the high cost of
additional degrees of freedom,

01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:28.414
there are some
leg companies that

01:00:28.414 --> 01:00:30.080
are going to be in
trouble if they don't

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:33.690
get the reimbursements that
they want on powered ankles,

01:00:33.690 --> 01:00:35.090
for example.

01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:40.315
And so in that sense they
share exactly the same problem.

01:00:40.315 --> 01:00:45.250
 

01:00:45.250 --> 01:00:46.120
Anything else?

01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:49.520
 

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:52.125
Any questions from
our remote rooms?

01:00:52.125 --> 01:00:59.150
 

01:00:59.150 --> 01:00:59.950
All right.

01:00:59.950 --> 01:01:03.040
Well, listen, thank you very
much for taking the time

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:04.140
to check it out.

01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:06.810
And I don't know if there's
a way for me to post contact

01:01:06.810 --> 01:01:10.440
information, but if anybody is
interested in further talking

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:16.740
about this, please get
with Michael Weiss-Malik

01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:19.260
and he'll put you
in touch with me.

01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:21.170
Thanks very much.

01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:25.122
