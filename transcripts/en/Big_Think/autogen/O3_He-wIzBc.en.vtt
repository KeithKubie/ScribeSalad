could spend a lot of money quickly and

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380
could spend a lot of money quickly and

healthcare has the advantage of it's a

huge huge sector it's a 2.4 trillion

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160
huge huge sector it's a 2.4 trillion
 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.679
huge huge sector it's a 2.4 trillion
it's about seventeen percent of the

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689
it's about seventeen percent of the
 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:25.900
it's about seventeen percent of the
economy so you could reasonably look to

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910
economy so you could reasonably look to
 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.519
economy so you could reasonably look to
expand that and you can look to expand a

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529
expand that and you can look to expand a
 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:29.019
expand that and you can look to expand a
relatively quickly and the way I propose

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029
relatively quickly and the way I propose
 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.540
relatively quickly and the way I propose
doing that was an employer tax credit

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550
doing that was an employer tax credit
 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.460
doing that was an employer tax credit
where we have you know somewhere around

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.470
where we have you know somewhere around
 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.830

30 40 million workers that don't get

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840
30 40 million workers that don't get
 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.110
30 40 million workers that don't get
employer-provided health insurance so if

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120
employer-provided health insurance so if
 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.850
employer-provided health insurance so if
we give employers a tax credit let's say

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860
we give employers a tax credit let's say
 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.590
we give employers a tax credit let's say
three thousand a worker to give those

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600
three thousand a worker to give those
 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.229
three thousand a worker to give those
workers health care coverage then my

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239
workers health care coverage then my
 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:45.820
workers health care coverage then my
guess is a awful lot of them would do

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:45.830
guess is a awful lot of them would do
 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.619
guess is a awful lot of them would do
that and what that would fairly quickly

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629
that and what that would fairly quickly
 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:49.810
that and what that would fairly quickly
do is on the one hand it would employ

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820
do is on the one hand it would employ
 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.369
do is on the one hand it would employ
people in the insurance industry not

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379
people in the insurance industry not
 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:52.600
people in the insurance industry not
something I'm anxious to do but as a

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610
something I'm anxious to do but as a
 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.910
something I'm anxious to do but as a
stopgap that's a good thing to do it

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920
stopgap that's a good thing to do it
 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.229
stopgap that's a good thing to do it
would give people health care employing

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239
would give people health care employing
 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:57.820
would give people health care employing
them in the health care sector and to

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:57.830
them in the health care sector and to
 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:58.990
them in the health care sector and to
some extent of course these people if

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000
some extent of course these people if
 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.100
some extent of course these people if
they don't have insurance they're paying

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110
they don't have insurance they're paying
 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.450
they don't have insurance they're paying
it out of pocket so what that would mean

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460
it out of pocket so what that would mean
 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.880
it out of pocket so what that would mean
is they will pay much less out of pocket

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890
is they will pay much less out of pocket
 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.140
is they will pay much less out of pocket
they'll have more money to spend and

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150
they'll have more money to spend and
 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.760
they'll have more money to spend and
these tend to be more moderate income

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770
these tend to be more moderate income
 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.190
these tend to be more moderate income
people so they are likely to spend it so

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200
people so they are likely to spend it so
 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.600
people so they are likely to spend it so
I thought that could give a good boost

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610
I thought that could give a good boost
 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.880
I thought that could give a good boost
to the economy now to actually transform

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890
to the economy now to actually transform
 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.890
to the economy now to actually transform
healthcare we have to go further I want

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900
healthcare we have to go further I want
 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.960
healthcare we have to go further I want
to see is have a public plan that people

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970
to see is have a public plan that people
 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.490
to see is have a public plan that people
could buy into but the idea would be

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500
could buy into but the idea would be
 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.080
could buy into but the idea would be
let's take advantage of the fact that we

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090
let's take advantage of the fact that we
 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.970
let's take advantage of the fact that we
actually just need to create demand so

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980
actually just need to create demand so
 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.650
actually just need to create demand so
in certain sense we don't mind the waste

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660
in certain sense we don't mind the waste
 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.280
in certain sense we don't mind the waste
waste waste right now is fine but what

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290
waste waste right now is fine but what
 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.230
waste waste right now is fine but what
we could do is one give people coverage

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240
we could do is one give people coverage
 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.280
we could do is one give people coverage
to Edward go and then say 2011-2012

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290
to Edward go and then say 2011-2012
 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:34.990
to Edward go and then say 2011-2012
presumably we'd have a national health

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000
presumably we'd have a national health
 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.580
presumably we'd have a national health
care plan ramped up that people could

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590
care plan ramped up that people could
 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.530
care plan ramped up that people could
buy into if they chose and then we'd

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540
buy into if they chose and then we'd
 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.940
buy into if they chose and then we'd
have a mechanism in place that could

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950
have a mechanism in place that could
 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.220
have a mechanism in place that could
start to control costs so I think that

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:42.230
start to control costs so I think that
 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.140
start to control costs so I think that
would be a very good way to look to do

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150
would be a very good way to look to do
 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.399
would be a very good way to look to do
something short-term boost the economy

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409
something short-term boost the economy
 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.160
something short-term boost the economy
and really jump-started stretch national

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170
and really jump-started stretch national
 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.480
and really jump-started stretch national
health care insurance which has to be

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490
health care insurance which has to be
 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.000
health care insurance which has to be
top priority and anyone's to my mind on

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010
top priority and anyone's to my mind on
 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.840
top priority and anyone's to my mind on
anyone's agenda right now

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850
 
 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.240
 
the other sort of two my my good way to

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250
the other sort of two my my good way to
 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.210
the other sort of two my my good way to
do stimulus is big stimulus i should say

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220
do stimulus is big stimulus i should say
 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.190
do stimulus is big stimulus i should say
is what i've called a payer play tax

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200
is what i've called a payer play tax
 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.160
is what i've called a payer play tax
credit pay for play i should say which

would give employers a tax credit for

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539
would give employers a tax credit for
 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.750
would give employers a tax credit for
providing workers of paid time off so

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760
providing workers of paid time off so
 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.490
providing workers of paid time off so
the way it would work is we pick a sum

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500
the way it would work is we pick a sum
 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.540
the way it would work is we pick a sum
of money let's say twenty five hundred

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550
of money let's say twenty five hundred
 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.090
of money let's say twenty five hundred
dollars per worker and we tell employers

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100
dollars per worker and we tell employers
 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.090
dollars per worker and we tell employers
that will pay them will pay them to

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100
that will pay them will pay them to
 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.970
that will pay them will pay them to
offset any amount to paid time off that

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980
offset any amount to paid time off that
 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.470
offset any amount to paid time off that
they give their workers up to twenty

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480
they give their workers up to twenty
 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.270
they give their workers up to twenty
five hundred dollars a year and the paid

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280
five hundred dollars a year and the paid
 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.680
five hundred dollars a year and the paid
time off could take the form of paid

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690
time off could take the form of paid
 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.259
time off could take the form of paid
sick days paid parental leave paid

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269
sick days paid parental leave paid
 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.270

vacations shortening the standard work

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280
vacations shortening the standard work
 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.920
vacations shortening the standard work
week and what that would do is on the

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930
week and what that would do is on the
 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.420
week and what that would do is on the
one hand it would directly get money and

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430
one hand it would directly get money and
 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.729
one hand it would directly get money and
into workers pockets but more

into workers pockets but more
importantly at least it might be more

really the outlier that way so it jumps

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030
really the outlier that way so it jumps
 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.970
really the outlier that way so it jumps
start us that way but in terms of the
