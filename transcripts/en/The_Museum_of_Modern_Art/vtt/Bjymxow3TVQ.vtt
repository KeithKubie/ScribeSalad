00:00:06.822 --> 00:00:09.532
Relief print making origins
started in hand-printing

00:00:09.532 --> 00:00:12.244
meaning no press was required.

00:00:12.244 --> 00:00:15.610
You are able as an artist
or a commercial printer

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.251
printing text able to transfer the image

00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:21.322
by hand by use of a
baren. A baren is a small

00:00:21.322 --> 00:00:25.902
object that allows you
to apply even pressure

00:00:25.902 --> 00:00:27.785
larger than that of your hand.

00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:32.198
In this case the block has been inked, and

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:36.834
a thin sheet of paper is
laid over top of the block.

00:00:37.676 --> 00:00:41.457
With gentle pressure, apply to the block.

00:00:41.457 --> 00:00:44.530
You can transfer the ink
to the sheet of paper.

00:00:46.761 --> 00:00:49.642
A baren is typically used
on thin sheets of paper.

00:00:50.442 --> 00:00:53.712
The heavier weight papers
that most artist use today

00:00:53.712 --> 00:00:57.787
are too thick for hand to be
able to apply pressure all the

00:00:57.787 --> 00:01:01.330
way through that sheet for an
even transfer of the image.

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:08.622
You can check the impression to
ensure you got a cool even pull.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.003
Wood cuts use a flat piece
of wood in a case that we'll

00:01:13.003 --> 00:01:15.716
demonstrate today. There
will be a cabinet grade

00:01:15.716 --> 00:01:18.380
plywood which is extremely
dimensionally stable,

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.351
but still has a beautiful grain.

00:01:20.351 --> 00:01:22.718
The grain of the wood and
wood cut is one reason that

00:01:22.718 --> 00:01:24.550
artists utilize the material.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.054
The grain provides a different
effect, in the black areas

00:01:29.054 --> 00:01:30.304
of the print.

00:01:30.304 --> 00:01:32.065
Contrast to something like linoleum cuts,

00:01:32.065 --> 00:01:34.492
where the black ares are totally flat.

00:01:34.492 --> 00:01:38.870
A wood cut, the grain will
affect just how heavily black the

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.472
black areas of the print can be printed.

00:01:41.472 --> 00:01:46.014
The grain has a visual effect that can
often be used to an artist advantage.

00:01:46.014 --> 00:01:48.974
When cutting on a wood block,
you use a different set of

00:01:48.974 --> 00:01:52.677
tools much similar to
that of a wood carver or a

00:01:52.677 --> 00:01:53.969
a cabinet maker.

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:57.254
These tools provide the
artist and the opportunity

00:01:57.254 --> 00:01:59.325
to have a variety of marks, widths, and

00:01:59.325 --> 00:02:01.856
depths from which to work with.

00:02:01.856 --> 00:02:05.997
In relief print making a wood
cut block is prepared first by

00:02:05.997 --> 00:02:08.938
toning the block with
an Indian ink wash or

00:02:08.938 --> 00:02:11.200
a wash of a jet black film ink.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.174
This provides a black
ground on the surface

00:02:13.174 --> 00:02:16.056
from which to easily see to removed areas

00:02:16.056 --> 00:02:19.051
of wood, to reveal the
drawing in a way that

00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:21.718
allows the artist to
understand what is happening,

00:02:21.718 --> 00:02:23.509
and where their drawing is going.

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:26.396
Once the block has been stained or toned,

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:29.474
the drawing can be
transferred through with

00:02:29.474 --> 00:02:32.305
the aid of an iron oxide
or carbon paper transfer.

00:02:32.305 --> 00:02:35.696
Once that paper transfer has been made,

00:02:35.696 --> 00:02:38.145
the artist now has the
choice of deciding which

00:02:38.145 --> 00:02:41.813
form of white line or
black line composition

00:02:41.813 --> 00:02:43.137
to utilize.

00:02:43.137 --> 00:02:46.058
White line is revealing
the image through thin

00:02:46.058 --> 00:02:48.142
white lines in a black
field. That would be

00:02:48.142 --> 00:02:51.047
cutting away those white
lines to leave the upper

00:02:51.047 --> 00:02:53.606
area or black field to take ink.

00:02:53.606 --> 00:02:57.086
The opposite way of
approaching the image area

00:02:57.086 --> 00:03:00.468
is what we call black
line. Which is removing

00:03:00.468 --> 00:03:03.169
the majority of the
information or wood to reveal

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:07.163
thin raised black lines
to accept the ink for

00:03:07.163 --> 00:03:08.765
transfer to paper.

00:03:08.765 --> 00:03:11.213
It is the balance of
white line and black line

00:03:11.213 --> 00:03:14.968
that creates a sense of depth
or three-dimensionality.

00:03:14.968 --> 00:03:17.618
Often an artist will have
a shift of white line

00:03:17.618 --> 00:03:19.920
to black line to be able to reveal a more

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.349
representational or dimensional space.

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.659
Once the image has been
cut into the block,

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:27.640
the block is prepared for printing.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.497
Ink is rolled over the
surface of the block,

00:03:30.497 --> 00:03:33.766
placed on the press, and
past through transferring

00:03:33.766 --> 00:03:35.165
ink to paper.

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.035
Linoleum block printing
or a liner cut is a

00:03:40.035 --> 00:03:42.702
form of relief print making. It relies on

00:03:42.702 --> 00:03:45.828
linoleum very much similar
to what would be in

00:03:45.828 --> 00:03:49.206
someones home. A linoleum
tile, as being a very

00:03:49.206 --> 00:03:53.257
flat consistent surface,
that you can gouge away

00:03:53.257 --> 00:03:55.616
the non-image area. Linoleum block prints

00:03:55.616 --> 00:03:58.705
provide a very specific
look, which would be

00:03:58.705 --> 00:04:01.898
something that has a flat black area.

00:04:01.898 --> 00:04:04.505
The type of linoleum block
print making that we do

00:04:04.505 --> 00:04:07.174
today is very affordable and accessible.

00:04:07.174 --> 00:04:10.475
The materials are easy to
use and easy for people

00:04:10.475 --> 00:04:13.286
to begin understanding
the basic concept of print

00:04:13.286 --> 00:04:15.915
making. Because of it's
affordability and ease

00:04:15.915 --> 00:04:18.540
of use, it can be used
by a variety of different

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.450
people all across the
world. To have a very quick

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.925
transfer of an idea to
a block that can then be

00:04:24.925 --> 00:04:26.662
replicated to print making.

00:04:27.124 --> 00:04:29.278
Approaching a linoleum
block print has very

00:04:29.278 --> 00:04:31.625
similar to that in
approaching of a wood cut.

00:04:31.625 --> 00:04:34.317
The material in itself
can be toned just like

00:04:34.317 --> 00:04:37.761
a wood block is toned, to
provide a black ground.

00:04:37.761 --> 00:04:40.892
It makes it easier to see
what it is your cutting.

00:04:40.892 --> 00:04:44.373
Linoleum in of itself, in a
material,does not necessarily

00:04:44.373 --> 00:04:46.760
need that, because it's
fairly easy to see what

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.239
it is that your doing.

00:04:48.239 --> 00:04:50.182
You can lay out your drawing ahead of time

00:04:50.182 --> 00:04:53.592
with a marker, or also
a carving, or iron-oxide

00:04:53.592 --> 00:04:56.411
transfer. In this case I
will approach the block

00:04:56.411 --> 00:05:01.294
with the material blank and
develop the image as I go.

00:05:01.294 --> 00:05:05.397
Also like a wood cut, if I remove
material, I can not be replace.

00:05:05.397 --> 00:05:07.645
Whatever I cut away will be white.

00:05:07.645 --> 00:05:09.514
Whatever remains will be black.

00:05:10.622 --> 00:05:13.466
The tools we use for linoleum
cuts are very similar

00:05:13.466 --> 00:05:16.746
to those of a wood cut.
The difference is the

00:05:16.746 --> 00:05:19.629
type of metal that's
used. Linoleum is a much

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:22.053
softer material and
does not dull the tools

00:05:22.053 --> 00:05:24.379
nearly as quickly as wood dulls the tools.

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:27.184
A high carving steel is
not necessarily required

00:05:27.184 --> 00:05:29.684
for doing linoleum cut.
You can see the different

00:05:29.684 --> 00:05:33.717
shapes here. A V gouge
and U tip. Very similar

00:05:33.717 --> 00:05:36.030
to that of a wood cut.

00:05:37.722 --> 00:05:41.301
These are the tools that
we use for linoleum cuts,

00:05:41.301 --> 00:05:43.507
and the tools that we
have for wood cut are

00:05:43.507 --> 00:05:46.165
very specific. Anything
that can remove material

00:05:46.165 --> 00:05:49.302
is a tool that can be
used. An artist may use

00:05:49.302 --> 00:05:52.691
a crowbar, screwdriver, a nail, and all of

00:05:52.691 --> 00:05:54.989
these things that mark or
[mar 05:53] the surface

00:05:54.989 --> 00:05:56.230
will provide image area.

00:05:57.414 --> 00:05:59.060
Once you drawn a basic
image on the linoleum

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.697
block you can begin cutting. In this case

00:06:01.697 --> 00:06:04.776
I've used some simple
text but remembering that

00:06:04.776 --> 00:06:07.866
this will be printed in
reverse. Everything on

00:06:07.866 --> 00:06:10.256
the block must be backwards.

00:06:11.363 --> 00:06:15.241
So for printing a relief
block, that's a linoleum

00:06:15.241 --> 00:06:17.419
cut, it's the same approach
as to printing a wood

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:20.589
cut. We want an even
application and anchor across

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:23.382
the entire block. In this
case, because the surface

00:06:23.382 --> 00:06:25.987
of the linoleum will print a flat black.

00:06:25.987 --> 00:06:28.317
We're insuring that we make a very even

00:06:28.317 --> 00:06:31.060
application with no texture.
