00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.010
Hey it's me Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. So let's pretend for a second that you're a

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.080
macaw and you live in the Amazon rainforest. Life is pretty good, you have all

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.090
the fruit you want, but there's one problem. You don't get all the nutrients that you need

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.100
out of that fruit. So how do you do that? So to answer that question today

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.160
I've traveled over four days, most of that being in the Amazon rainforest

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.190
with an outfit called Rainforest Expeditions, and this is our final boat ride.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.230
So we're gonna get in this boat, and we're

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.240
gonna go up river here at the Tambopata River. Gerson's gonna go with us.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.270
He's helping me haul some photo gear. You're getting Smarter Every Day.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.290

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.480
Gracias SeÃ±or.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.340
So I'm in a boat full of researchers here at the Tambopata

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.380
Research Center and we are about to go check out exactly how these macaws

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.420
handle the nutrient problem.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.460
[ Music ]

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.490
Let's go to the main spot first,

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.570
and then we see how activity goes in the beginning, OK? (Destin) OK, sounds good.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.640
[Music &amp; rainforest bird sounds]

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:47.320
      

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.820
So this guy right here is in charge.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.830
He hasn't said a word to me since I've been here. He's in the zone. He's got a clipboard,

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.850
so you know he's legit. Talk now or talk later?
- Talk later. [ laugh ]

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.870
Talk later. Got it. I told ya, he's busy doing science,

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.900
don't mess with the man. OK so that spot of dirt,

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.920
right over there is the largest clay lick in the world. Here at the Tambopata Research Center,

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.960
researchers come from all over just to watch this spot of dirt.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.990
Macaws, parrots and other birds come in and they eat the dirt and that gives them the

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.000
nutrients they need. So today we've brought a high speed camera and we're gonna try to capture the macaws

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.020
doing this. Should be pretty cool.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.050
[ Music ]

00:02:31.070 --> 00:03:19.980
          

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.370
OK one thing that the birds do 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.400
that we don't really understand yet is called flashing. It's when a bunch of them pile up on the

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.440
clay lick and then all of a sudden boom, all of them release at one time. So hopefully

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.470
I can give this high speed video to the researchers and they can use it.

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.980
It's a flash.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.570
[Music]

00:03:38.590 --> 00:04:49.000
              

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.060
(Gustavo Martinez) [in Spanish] Here we have the times,

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.980
and the different sections of the clay lick, the weather and the different species.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.200
OK so I'm home now, but I can't stop thinking about why a macaw would eat dirt.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.230
Well, between all my scratching of bug bites, I contacted the Schubot Center

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.260
for exotic bird health at Texas A&amp;M University and spoke with a guy named Dr Don Brightsmith.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.300
For the past few decades the theory's been there's toxins in fruit in the jungle

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.320
and that the birds are eating this clay to neutralize the toxins. But research by

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.340
Dr Brightsmith suggests that it has more to do with sodium and how rain falls on the continent in South America

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.360
in general. So if you begin to look at South America you can understand why this happens. On the west

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.370
side we have the Pacific Ocean on the east side we have the Atlantic Ocean so it makes sense that the

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.410
evaporation would create rain and create the Amazon rainforest. But, that's not what happens.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.440
If you look at a satellite image it's easy to see, but the Andes mountains actually

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.470
cuts off the moisture before it gets over to the Amazon rainforest.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.510
In fact, most of the stuff to the west of the Andes is pure desert. This means that most of the moisture

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.560
in the Amazon rainforest comes from the Atlantic side of the continent. So as moisture

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.570
evaporates here in the Atlantic Ocean, it begins to deposit it's minerals as it

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.620
crosses the continent. And by the time it gets here to eastern Peru most of the minerals

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.660
have leeched into the soil because it's gone through the hydrological cycle several times.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.670
Dr Brightsmith and his team analyzed the clay that the macaws are eating at the Tambopata Research Center

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.700
and they discovered that there's much higher concentrations of sodium. So there you go.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.720
That's why clay licks exist. So I hope you enjoyed the video. I had to spend some time away from

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.750
the family in order to do it, but I hope it was worth it for you. If you would please consider

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.770
subscribing and check out the links in the video description below I'd appreciate it. You're getting Smarter Every Day.

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:26.850
Have a good one. Don't eat my passport. You can't eat my passport.

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.870
[ laughs ]

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.880
Get back in the boat.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.910
Why aren't you doing anything?
- I don't know what to do.

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.930
[ laughs ]
And that's how we got the high speed camera to the jungle.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.960
Right there. I don't have a lens

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:50.980
that can reach way over there, so Jeff the high resolution

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.010
photographer here at Rainforest Expeditions, he let me borrow his

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:59.040
600mm lens, so that's what we're doing.
- So I'm looking forward to taking this

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:03.100
sound and pitching it down, and turning them into scary parrot monsters.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.110
(Destin) [ laughs ] What?!

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:11.120
- What, do you think we're recording wildlife for wildlife?

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:15.160
So today we're in Peru. It's pretty awesome. We've assembled a team of people

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:19.190
who are gonna capture Macchu Piccu in the highest resolution photo that's ever been made of it.

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:23.230
Got a special panoramic robotic camera mount.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:25.250
We've got all kinds of cool stuff.
