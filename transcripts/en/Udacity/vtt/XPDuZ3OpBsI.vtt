00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.520
Now the interesting question is, once I go to the

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.400
node that I think is going to give me the page

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.410
that I'm looking for, or at least information about the page

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.390
that I'm looking for. Whether it is, if it has it,

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.970
it's going to give it to me, or if it

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:17.790
doesn't have it, it's going to tell me that it is

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.090
on the disk. But, in either case, I'm going to get,

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.170
I'm hoping, I'll get exact information about this missing page from

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.250
this node which is supposed to have the

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.870
page foame directory, the PFD that corresponds with

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.980
this UID. Is that possible that I go to this guy, and he says no, I

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.845
don't have it. Yes, it is possible in two cases. One case is, let's say, while

00:00:44.845 --> 00:00:48.490
this guy was sending this request over, this

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.390
guy has made a decision to evict that

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.630
page that corresponds to this UID because it had to make space for itself. In

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:03.550
that case, that UID may have been thrown away from the PFD. And if it has been

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:10.730
thrown away from the PFD, what he would have done is inform the guy who has

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:16.830
the ownership for this UID, this node is the owner for this UID. If he evicts

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.685
that page this guy has to tell this node that,

00:01:20.685 --> 00:01:22.730
hey, you know what, I used to back this UID

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:28.000
in my PFD but I got rid of it. And, and I got rid of it by sending it to some

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.050
other node, let's say, node D. So that is something

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.240
that I have to communicate to this GCD, but it's a

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.070
distributed system. Things are happening asynchronously. He may not have

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.540
communicated that yet, that information is not there in the GCD

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.830
of this node. This is the owner for this UID space. But the owner

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.260
doesn't yet know that the PFD that corresponds to a particular

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.030
UID has moved to some other node out here somewhere. And if

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.340
it has moved to some other node, he will

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.600
know about eventually, but he doesn't have it at this

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.760
point. That's why this request was routed here, and

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.660
this guy says I don't have it. It can have

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.850
a miss. That's one possibility. Second possibility

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.250
is the uncommon case that the POD information

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.460
that I had is stale. When can that happen? That is when the POD is being

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.850
recomputed for the local area network as a

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.550
whole, either because there are new additions or

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.310
new deletions of nodes. And therefore we are

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.940
recomputing the redistribution of the UID space and

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.980
deciding which node is responsible for which UID. That can

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.230
happen. And in that case also, it is possible that

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.823
the information that I started with was incorrect. Because I

00:02:43.823 --> 00:02:46.343
went here thinking that he has the GCD, he didn't

00:02:46.343 --> 00:02:48.821
have it at that point, but it is changing. And

00:02:48.821 --> 00:02:51.780
eventually I'm going to find out. So if there is a

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.329
mess, either case. The first case is, this guy replaced

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:58.434
that page, or the second case is, my POD information

00:02:58.434 --> 00:03:02.020
misled me. Both cases, I'll have a miss. And I'll

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.000
say, oh, it was a miss. And I know that

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.284
is probably the uncommon case. I'm going to retry that,

00:03:08.284 --> 00:03:10.864
by looking up my POD again. And by that time, the

00:03:10.864 --> 00:03:13.904
POD may have been updated, I'll go to the right

00:03:13.904 --> 00:03:17.218
GCD this time. Or, the GCD would have been updated

00:03:17.218 --> 00:03:19.682
and so I'll go to the same GCD, but the

00:03:19.682 --> 00:03:23.455
GCD will have the more relevant information of which PFD is

00:03:23.455 --> 00:03:26.295
currently hosting it. So, I'll go to him in

00:03:26.295 --> 00:03:29.620
order to get the page that I'm looking for.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.120
But the important point I want to leave you with

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.470
is that the common case is when both the POD

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.360
and GCD are coresident on the same node. And

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.560
in that case, you don't have a network communication to

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.760
look up the GCD, and also the miss happening

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.808
when you do reach the PFD. That is also uncommon.

00:03:48.808 --> 00:03:52.730
It can because happen because of replacement that has happened

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.110
on that node, or because the POD has changed. And this

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.130
is something that is going to happen relatively infrequently compared to

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.980
the activities that we're talking about in terms of page faults.
