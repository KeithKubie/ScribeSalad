equal adding more batteries to a vehicle

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990
equal adding more batteries to a vehicle
 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.660
equal adding more batteries to a vehicle
is going to allow the vehicle to drive

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670
is going to allow the vehicle to drive
 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.370

instead of gasoline and that's a good

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540
instead of gasoline and that's a good
 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.170
instead of gasoline and that's a good
thing however these batteries are very

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180
thing however these batteries are very
 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.850

extra weight can reduce fuel efficiency

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710
extra weight can reduce fuel efficiency
 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.350
extra weight can reduce fuel efficiency
and the production of the batteries

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360
and the production of the batteries
 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.270

themselves have implications for the
 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.089
themselves have implications for the
environment and so to know which is

environment and so to know which is
 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.550

better on balance requires an analysis

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560
better on balance requires an analysis
 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.420
better on balance requires an analysis

vehicle the more taxpayers should
subsidize that vehicle and this leads me

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690
subsidize that vehicle and this leads me
 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.120
subsidize that vehicle and this leads me

of that the current policy gives up to

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:20.860
of that the current policy gives up to
 

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.730
of that the current policy gives up to
75 hundred dollars per vehicle for up to

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:23.740
75 hundred dollars per vehicle for up to
 

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.730
75 hundred dollars per vehicle for up to
200,000 vehicles per manufacturer so

200,000 vehicles per manufacturer so
 

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.950
200,000 vehicles per manufacturer so
that's 1.5 billion dollars if we have

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:28.960
that's 1.5 billion dollars if we have
 

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.960
that's 1.5 billion dollars if we have
1.5 billion dollars worth of subsidies

to spend and we spent it all on

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:33.190
to spend and we spent it all on
 

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.280

hybrid electric vehicle we could buy

hybrid electric vehicle we could buy
about 400,000 of those vehicles and we

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:39.670
about 400,000 of those vehicles and we
 

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:43.110
about 400,000 of those vehicles and we
would reduce damages by about 350

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:43.120
would reduce damages by about 350
 

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.750
would reduce damages by about 350
million dollars but if we were to spend

million dollars but if we were to spend
 

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.520

battery electric vehicles that are more
 

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:50.820
battery electric vehicles that are more
expensive we couldn't buy as many of

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:50.830
expensive we couldn't buy as many of
 

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:52.710
expensive we couldn't buy as many of
them and the net amount of benefits we

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:52.720
them and the net amount of benefits we
 

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.410
them and the net amount of benefits we
reproduce would be quite a bit lower the

bottom line is that hybrid electric

00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:57.940
bottom line is that hybrid electric
 

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:01.860

vehicles and plug-in vehicles with small
battery packs provide the most amount of

could be in the future that large

could be in the future that large
battery packs will become more

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:11.470
battery packs will become more
 

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:13.650
battery packs will become more
competitive we would need cheaper

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:13.660
competitive we would need cheaper
 

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.860
competitive we would need cheaper
batteries more expensive gasoline we

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:16.870
batteries more expensive gasoline we
 

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:19.740
batteries more expensive gasoline we
would need cleaner electricity and long

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:19.750
would need cleaner electricity and long
 

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:21.000
would need cleaner electricity and long
battery life so we're not replacing

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:21.010
battery life so we're not replacing
 

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:22.710
battery life so we're not replacing
these batteries before the end of life

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:22.720
these batteries before the end of life
 

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.360
these batteries before the end of life
and we'd have to overcome some of the

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:24.370
and we'd have to overcome some of the
 

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:26.730
and we'd have to overcome some of the
issues with range but I would argue that

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:26.740
issues with range but I would argue that
 

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:29.190
