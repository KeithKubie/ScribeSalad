Sandhya Menon, Nicola Yoon,

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.310
Abby McGanney Nolan (mod)

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.610
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.520
&gt;&gt; Abby McGanney Nolan:
Hey everyone.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.520
Welcome to the Library of
Congress National Book Festival.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.890
My name is Abby Nolan and
I review children's books

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.190
for the Washington Post which
has been a charter sponsor

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:22.730
of the festival.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.800
We want to thank the Co-Chairman
of the festival, David Rubenstein

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.050
and the many National
Book Festival sponsors

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.080
who have made this event possible.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.390
If you would like to help support
the festival with a donation,

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.880
you can find that information
in your program.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.320
So before we start with the panel
discussion about falling in love,

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.980
or rather books about
people falling in love,

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.870
I want to introduce our
three amazing authors.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.710
There will be time for questions
from the audience and everyone

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.450
who asks a question will
be filmed for the archives

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.620
and could appear on
a later broadcast.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.990
So first, Melissa de la Cruz
is the bestselling author

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.700
of many well-loved novels.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.600
These include several series
such as the Blue Blood Series

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.580
which Booklist called "Famed
and fabulous" "The Isle

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.150
of the Lost" Descendant Series, and
the "Witches of East End Series",

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.660
as well as, standalone novels
like "Fresh off the Boat"

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.810
and "Something In Between."

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.160
Melissa's latest book is
"Alex and Eliza" a love story

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.590
which is inspired by her daughter's
interest in Elizabeth Schuyler

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.130
after they saw the
musical "Hamilton."

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.580
Melissa was born in the
Philippines, moved to San Francisco

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.510
when was twelve and now lives with
her family in southern California.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.150
[ Applause ]

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.020
&gt;&gt; Melissa de la Cruz: That's me.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.210
&gt;&gt; Abby McGanney Nolan: Next
we have Nicola Yoon who grew

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.780
up in Jamaica and Brooklyn,
New York.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.390
She has written two
bestselling books

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.770
about teenagers falling in love.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.000 position:56%
The first, "Everything, Everything"
has won lots of acclaim and has been

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.760
as you probably know
made into a movie.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.670
Her latest novel is called
"The Sun Is Also a Star"

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.210
which follows two New York City
high school students seniors

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.880
and mostly takes place in the
course of one very eventful day.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.510
Nicola lives in Los
Angeles with her family.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.300
[ Applause ]

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.980
And at the end we have
Sandhya Menon.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.280
She was born and raised in
India and some of her love

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.520
for Hollywood movies
can be discerned

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.920
in her first novel
"When Dimple Met Rishi."

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.050
It is also a bestselling novel

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.790
and it follows two Indian-American
teens whose parents conspire

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.040
to arrange their marriage.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.080
Sandhya lives in Colorado
with her family and pets,

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.850
and her next book is due next year.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.510
So, thank you.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.060
[ Applause ]

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.360
So, where to begin?

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.770
I was struck by the fact that
all three of the young women

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:14.020
in your newest books, seemed not at
all interested in falling in love

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.590
at the start of their stories.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:22.390
In "The Sun Is Also a Star" Natasha
is going to be deported that night

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.570
to Jamaica and is laser
focused on finding a lawyer

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.730
who can help them stay
in the United States.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.910 position:56%
At the beginning of "Alex and
Eliza", Elizabeth Schuyler does not,

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.910
doesn't want to put on a fancy
gown she's supposed to wear

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.310
and is much more concerned with the
war that's going on around them,

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.660
and in "When Dimple Met
Rishi" Dimple is obsessed

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.480
with creating her own app.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.610
She wants to help people deal
with serious medical issues;

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.390
wants to make a difference
in the world

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:58.060
and here comes this
boy who distracts her.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:05.000 position:56%
So, did you all start out with this
kind of character with this scenario

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.330
or did that develop as you
were writing the books?

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.880
&gt;&gt; Melissa de la Cruz:
Who wants to take it?

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:18.420 position:56%
You know, I was really interested
in Elizabeth Schuyler as a character

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.910
and it was interesting to me
that I was interested in her

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.090
because I'm usually drawn
to the more kind of worldly,

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.140
the more gossipy, the more
sophisticated characters.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.000 position:56%
So I was wondering why wasn't I
writing a book about Angelica who is

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.290
so much more the kind of
character that I write, you know,

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.920
much more interested in
status and, you know,

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.320
kind of furthering her own
kind of vain ambitions,

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.490
because I love kind
of those villainess.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.910
Like I cheer for the Baroness
in "Sound of Music", you know,

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.990
so you know so that's the kind
of character I always like.

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.460
So, I said, "Why am I
so interested in Eliza?"

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.740
And I didn't know didn't know
whether it's like the times we are

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.950
in now, but I just wanted
to write about somebody

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.350
who was a really good
person and I was so drawn

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.780
to her the way Alexander Hamilton
wrote about his love for her.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.150
You know, what drew him to
her, you know, and I just felt

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.140
like she embodied this
kind of American you know

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.360
like really true American
values, you know,

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.260
like she was not worldly
in the way Angelica was.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.330
You know, she was not this kind
of flirt who would like come

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.140
into a European ballroom.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.650
You know, like she
was very sensible.

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.290
She was very practical and
I think in kind of writing

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.760
about her character, I wanted to
show that she wanted to be part

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.970
of you know the war
effort, you know,

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.920 position:56%
part of like helping the revolution,
like that's what mattered to her.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.960 position:56%
You know, not falling in love with
a soldier, you know, like she wanted

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.000 position:56%
to be you know somebody who mattered
in her own way and it didn't matter

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.160
who she married, so that's
where that came from.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.180
&gt;&gt; Nicola Yoon: Yeah, I mean,
so "The Sun Is Also a Star" is

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.670
about a very poetic boy
named Daniel who tries

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.240
to convince Natasha who's very
science-minded to fall in love

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.540
with him over the course of
twelve hours in New York City

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.840
and they only have twelve hours

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.170
because her family
is being deported.

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:17.160
And you know, what I really wanted
to talk about in the book is,

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.630
you know, the idea that science
and arts are opposed to each other.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.590
Like we always put those things on
the opposite end of the spectrum

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.370
and people say that they're
left brain or right brain

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.130
or they're good a math or
they're good at English and as

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:31.890
if you couldn't be both, right.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.840
I mean, I think most people
are reasonably good at both,

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.130
but we sort of specialize
really young.

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:41.360
And I think a way of looking
at the world is to look at it

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.860
from both an artistic perspective
and from a more scientific one

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.000
and I think you actually
get a more complete picture

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.640
of the world that way.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:55.070
And in both places are true, like
art and science they're all trying

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:58.620
to get truth but they just
come at it from different ways.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.580
So, given that I wanted
to talk about that

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.230
and like I'm really was a big
fan of Carl Sagan and sort

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.080
of the way he was able to take
science and bring it down to

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.480
like a human level, I just came
up with the passion of Daniel.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.840
So, Daniel is like the boy

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.120
who doesn't really
believe in facts, you know.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.420
He's like it's fine.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:20.780
It's all about love and Natasha
is like very, very science-minded,

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.580 position:56%
right so she is you know, like if
you can't write it down and prove it

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.820
and measure it, I don't
want to hear about it.

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:30.680
And I really wanted to see how I
could make these two people come

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:35.120
together and come to the place
where you know the world is made

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.440
up of both those things
and your brain,

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.050
it's not mind versus
body, it's them together.

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:44.110
It is science and art, I
mean, all if mixed for love.

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:47.740
So I think that's where
the book came from.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.070
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: And when
Dimple; can you guys hear me?

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:54.610
Okay. In "When Dimple Met Rishi"
I was really interested in playing

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:57.730
with the gender stereotypes
and kind of reversing them

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:01.390 position:56%
where we always hear that girls are
really interested in falling in love

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:04.730
and getting married and
having that happily ever after

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:08.150
and boys are more interested in
independence and their career.

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:12.280
So I wanted to flip that and have
the girl be really independent

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:15.670
career minded and wanted nothing
to do with love and the boy

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:19.740
to be really a traditionalist
and a huge, soft romantic

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:24.500
and so that's kind of where
Dimple gets her fierceness from.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:25.800
&gt;&gt; Abby McGanney Nolan:
That's great.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.890
Um, to look at the plots
of these novels it seems

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:32.760
like you all are getting
them to know each other,

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:36.630
the two main characters, as
they find out what's important

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:40.880
to each other and what their sense
of humor is, and at the same time,

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:45.970
you're putting obstacles in
their way, lost cell phones,

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:50.360
misunderstandings, family
battles, deportation.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:55.210
How do you manage these
waring objectives?

00:08:55.210 --> 00:09:02.900
Do you have to plot it out or
how do you manage that narrative?

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.570
&gt;&gt; Nicola Yoon: Yeah, you know, so
"Sun Is Also a Star" takes place

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:10.220
over twelve hours in New York, and
when I had the idea I thought, "Oh,

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:12.390
this is going to be good."

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:15.940
And then what you realize is
that it's twelve hours, right,

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:17.990
and you have to manage
your day, right.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:21.650
Like what is the average walking
speed of the teenage couple?

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:24.780
Like what are the train
schedules in New York City

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:27.530
and how long does it take to get
from this place to that place?

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:31.330
And I have a Excel spreadsheet
that maps it all out,

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:33.950
because the first draft I
think I had twenty hours.

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:36.660
It was just like, that
does not work.

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.810
They cannot walk that fast
unless they fly and they

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:42.920
like literally lift the weight
with their hands and, so yeah,

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:46.250
I mean it's like some of
that stuff is just practical

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:49.190
like seriously Google
maps was my friend,

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:54.440
because it has train schedules
on there now and they have videos

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.750
and you can sort of
fly through New York

00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:00.000
and see the different
neighborhoods and map the,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.300
you know, the time it takes.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:05.060
So some of that is just purely
practical get your spreadsheet

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:07.170
out and do some math.

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:09.570
&gt;&gt; Melissa de la Cruz: I
wanted to write like a "Pride

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:15.010 position:56%
and Prejudice" style conflict into
my story, because you know the story

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:17.370
of Alex and Eliza seemed
like such a fairytale.

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:21.430
That, you know, this penniless,
nameless orphan boy who falls

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:25.140
in love with basically a
rich American princess.

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:30.060 position:56%
So, I thought about you know what do
families with fortune usually want.

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:34.830 position:56%
They want their daughters to marry
men from other similarly landed and,

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:38.530
you know, very prestigious
families and that's her family.

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:42.400
Her mom, Catherine
Rensselaer was the daughter

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.190
of the richest family in New York.

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:48.940
I mean, they basically
owned the entire colony

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:52.440
and then her father was, you know,
General Philip Schuyler who came

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:55.330
from another really
landed prestigious family

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:58.270
and he was a general in
the Continental Army.

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:03.530
And so I wanted to write about how,
you know, her family was very weary

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:07.200
of you know this kind of, this guy
who came from nowhere, you know,

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.060
asking for their daughter's
hand and you know, of course,

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:14.200
mom you know moms always a little
bit a villain wanting you know a

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.720
very rich marriage.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:18.350
So, that's where the
conflict came from.

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:24.850
So, I outline and always outline
my stories, but a lot of the things

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:27.270
like I knew I wanted
to start with the ball.

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:29.630
I knew I wanted to have, you
know, a little bit of conflict.

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:32.370
I wanted to show the war and
then I wanted to show, you know,

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:35.170
this kind of "Pride and
Prejudice" storyline.

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:37.950
So, yeah a lot of is
a lot of planning.

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:41.430
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Similarly, in
"When Dimple Met Rishi" I knew

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:44.880
from the beginning that there
would be a lot of obstacles

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.690
with both Dimple and
Rishi and their parents,

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:50.440
and like familial expectations.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.970
And so, that was something I
thought about from the beginning,

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:56.580
but also as I was writing,
what evolved more was

00:11:56.580 --> 00:12:00.980
like this whole question of being
Indian-American and belonging

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:05.360
to two cultures and which parts
of which culture do I want accept

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.180
and which parts don't work
for me and what does that mean

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:09.480
when it comes to my family.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.080
So that kind of evolved as I wrote.

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:16.110
&gt;&gt; Abby McGanney Nolan: I
also wanted to ask you all

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:21.210
about this idea of
hopeless romantic.

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:24.110
I think Nicola you mentioned
you talked about yourself

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:30.930 position:56%
as a hopeless romantic, but it seems
hopeful a romantic and I also wanted

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:35.310
to ask about destiny and kismet
and they all kind of come

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:41.970
up in your books and how did
you think through that theme?

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.430
&gt;&gt; Nicola Yoon: Yeah, I mean I
always say I'm a hopeless romantic,

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:48.580
but you know, I think that
as a culture we tend to talk

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:53.520 position:56%
down about love, right, and
especially when we talk about books.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:58.060
And falling in love, but this
is my mantra in life, right,

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:00.910
everything is about love,
like no matter like,

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:02.620
don't let people tell
you it's not right.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:06.870
If it's love with your work or if
it's love of heart, or your family,

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:12.120
or your kids, or yourself, or
another person in a romantic way,

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.110
everything is about love.

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:17.430
It's the thing that everyone
wants or they're recovering from

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:20.090
or they're trying to get.

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:23.140
And so, you know, I
always write about it.

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:27.240
I particularly love a romantic
book because I love the idea

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:31.510
of people falling in love with
each other's ideas of the world

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:34.410
and usually people start
out thinking that they're

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:37.340
so different than someone else.

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:41.020
In "Sun Is Also a Star" you have
like the Korean American boy

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:43.950
and this Jamaican immigrant
and they start out thinking

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:47.190
that they couldn't possibly have
anything in common and I married

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:51.400
to someone who's American but of
Korean descent and I have more

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.280
in common with him than I've ever
had with anyone in my whole life.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.630
And like that includes my like
you know Jamaican parents, right,

00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:01.510
so I think we tend to think these
things that we're so far apart

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:05.530
and we talk down about
love, but it is the thing

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:08.000
that makes the world go
round, and like I don't care

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.330
if anyone thinks that's a cheesy
of a tool goober about it,

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:13.610
but it is the thing that
makes the world go round

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:19.320
and so it is why I write
about it all the time.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.750
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: I also
believe in the power of love.

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:27.760
Like I think that looking down on
romance is pretty common and also

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.760
like first love or teen
romance, like people are like oh

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:35.240 position:56%
that will never last, and I ended up
marrying my high school sweetheart,

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:39.610
so I think I'm like especially
you know I take offense

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:42.870
to that, because it did work out.

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:46.020
But I love this idea of like
kismet and that comes up a lot

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:49.610
in "When Dimple Met Rishi" and
just the idea of like two people

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:54.160
who on the surface seem to be
poles apart, but they come together

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.870 position:56%
and they find, you know, something
in common because they're just meant

00:14:57.870 --> 00:14:59.740
to be and I love that idea,

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:03.250
so that was something I
just love to write about.

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:05.960
&gt;&gt; Melissa de la Cruz: Yeah, no
it was interesting what you said

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.980
about how people kind of
denigrate love like even

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:14.120
in the book there's a one scene and
it's interesting as I was looking

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:16.770
at a, you know, kind of Internet
reactions to the book, you know,

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:18.360
they said, "Oh, that
could never happen."

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:21.650
You know, Alexander Hamilton
was a love struck guy.

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:22.950
Oh please.

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:25.250
You know, especially that
scene that's so cheesy

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:29.200
and then the scene is when he
spends an entire night with Eliza

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.860
and he comes back to the fort and
he can't remember the password,

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:35.860
like he just can't remember
it because he was so in love.

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:37.510
He was like in the
cloud and, you know,

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:39.690
he just couldn't remember
the password to get back

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:42.360
into the fort, and
that's a real story.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:45.900
Like that actually happened
and finally the young soldier,

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:47.290
you know, like took pity on him.

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:49.540
Like he knew he was you
know Colonel Hamilton.

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:52.740
He was like yeah get in, you know,
but you know that was a real story

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:55.330
and I think that kind of,
that's what made me interested

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:58.270
in this story like that somebody
that we saw as this genius,

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:01.330 position:56%
this founding father, the
Secretary of the Treasury, you know,

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:03.070
wrote The Federalist Papers.

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:06.650
He was a guy in love
once and the other reason

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:08.050
that I wrote the story was

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:11.060
because even though they didn't
have a perfect marriage, you know,

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:14.470
we all know he cheated on
her, as my daughter says

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:17.290
"Is the sequel Alex
and Eliza and Maria?"

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:21.120
I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:25.530
You know, but because she
forgave him you know and the fact

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:31.890
that she died wearing; he wrote
her a poem when they were courting

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:35.830
and she put it in a necklace and
she died buried with that necklace

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:37.800
and she was the one who
carried on his legacy

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.530
who made sure we know about him.

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:43.120
And I think because of her love
for him, I felt like I could write

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.860
about them, that it was still a
love that was worthy of writing

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:48.960
about because the other thing
that people talk about is

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:52.800
like oh he was you know an
adulterer, he was unfaithful

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.320
and I was like well
why does that takeaway

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.140 position:56%
from this great love that they have?

00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:01.450
I mean, he was flawed, you know,
he was human and he made a mistake,

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:05.400
but you know, they, he; she forgave
him and they you know died together

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.220
and I just thought it just
made me you know kind of think

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:12.260
about what kinds of love there are
and that to me was just so great

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:16.480
to have that kind of love to
be able to forgive someone.

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.840
We're all hopeless romantics here.

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:24.240
&gt;&gt; Abby McGanney Nolan: I was
also impressed by the fact

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:29.590
that all three books take the
perspective of both parties;

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:34.570
both the female and the male and I
was wondering if that was something

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:39.030
that you set out to do all
of you or if that just seemed

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:44.620
like the way to go at some point:?

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:46.600
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: I
definitely set out to do that.

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:51.670
I've never written in dual,
you know, point of view before

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:54.260
and I thought it would be
so fascinating especially

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:58.510 position:56%
because the characters are so
completely different from each other

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:01.990
for the reader to be able to
see the love story developing

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:03.300
from both their points of view,

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:06.840
because they have completely
different ideas of what love is

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:10.370 position:56%
and what they want from life and I
just thought it would be really cool

00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:14.160
to see how it comes
together at the end.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.390
&gt;&gt; Nicola Yoon: Yeah, I mean
definitely very similar, you know,

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:21.020
Daniel is the poetic one, right,
so he's sort of like pollen to air

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:24.390
and Natasha is very science-minded,

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:27.260
so I wanted to show the different
perspective and them coming

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:30.650
to like the common ground
and it was really fun

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:32.650
to have them experience
the same thing,

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:35.060
but like take a totally
different message from it, right.

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:38.860
Like to be able to just see
it completely differently,

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:42.630
and then sort of fall in
love with the other ways,

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:44.780
by the person's way
of looking at it.

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:50.320
My husband is like this very,
very strange person and I say

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:54.280
that with affection, but I we will
agree on things, but he will come

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:56.810
at it from a completely
out of left field.

00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:58.780
"Like, what are you
even talking about?"

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:00.620
And then I was like
"Oh, you're right."

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:05.150
But he just, he gets there
differently and so I wanted to show

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:09.620
that getting there differently
and how that's sort of cool.

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:13.000 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Melissa de la Cruz: No definitely
and I think because, you know,

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.270
we wanted to show this love
story from both sides, right,

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:19.890
it was like I mean Alex was just
as much a character that I cared

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:23.360 position:56%
about as Eliza and I think the story
would have been a little one-noted

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.440
if it was all from
her point of view.

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:29.640 position:56%
So, I think I liked to show you know
the male perspective and I also,

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:31.590
what's interesting is
like all of the guys

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:35.290
in our books are all the romantic
ones and you know that's even

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:39.260
like with me and husband, like I'm
much more practical and pragmatic

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.800
and he's the one who's the
hopeless romantic, you know,

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.810
so I kind of like that dynamic.

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:47.870
&gt;&gt; Abby McGanney Nolan: So I
wanted to talk about awkwardness.

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:52.550
These kind of uncomfortable
pauses, awkward moments,

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:59.190
and they seem to be tied into kind
of the sweetness to the characters,

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:02.790
both the men and the young
women and the young men.

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:07.630
And I don't really remember that in
the books that I read growing up,

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:12.020
but it seems you know kind of have
come to the floor with John Green,

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:16.730
and "Eleanor &amp; Park"
and I was wondering

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:20.290
if it's something that
you can speak to?

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:23.530
&gt;&gt; Nicola Yoon: I mean,
awkwardness can be glorious.

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:24.830
&gt;&gt; Melissa de la Cruz: Yeah.

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:27.580
&gt;&gt; Nicola Yoon: It's so
awkward can be so uncomfortable

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:30.620
and like you just, he's so
cute, you're thinking it

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:32.490
and then you're staring, you
don't realize you're staring

00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:33.800 position:56%
and there's something in your teeth.

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:35.500
It's terrible right?

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:39.580 position:56%
Or like the first kiss isn't
perfect but maybe the second one is.

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:42.080
I mean it's just true, right.

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:47.610
I mean, you just, I god I was
so embarrassing as a teenager.

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:49.140
You have no idea.

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:53.320
I was in love with
like the, high school,

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.950
captain of the high school
basketball team, completely in love

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:59.420
and I was, I was not his type.

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:04.900
I was like shy and just you
know read books all the time,

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:09.020
but I just loved him and I called
him on the phone and I was just

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:11.440
like an anonymous admirer; I don't
even know why I'm telling you this,

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:14.880
but it's terrible [brief laughter].

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:17.620
I was like his anonymous admirer
and he liked me on the phone

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:19.530
and then finally I said I'm
going to do the big reveal,

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:21.200
I was like fine I will
be wearing this.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.620
I'll be at the end of the
hallway this day, right?

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:25.920
Yeah, this [multiple speakers].

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:32.370
So, he is there at the end of
the hallway with his friends,

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:33.850
his basketball friend buddies.

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:36.940
I on the other hand, and he
looked at me and he pointed

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:41.120
and laughed and it was the worst.

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:48.230
I'm okay. And thank god,
because that guy is a loser

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:50.480 position:56%
and I've got the perfect boy for me,

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:53.930
but I mean my awkwardness
is just part of life, right,

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:56.510
and it's a funny story now.

00:21:56.510 --> 00:22:00.290
[ Laughter ]

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:01.590
&gt;&gt; Abby McGanney Nolan: Yeah,

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:04.110
and I think you all capture
awkwardness perfect, you know,

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:09.070
kind of exquisitely and it
leads to drama and resolution

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:14.190
and I mean do you really
work on it like every moment?

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:15.610
&gt;&gt; Melissa de la Cruz: Yeah,
I think you know you draw

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:19.800
from your own life, you know, and
there's been so; putting yourself

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:22.050
out there you know when you
told your story I was like,

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:25.450
oh my god I just remembered
so many embarrassing stories.

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:28.080
You know, of like telling
people that I, you know,

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.810
"I like you.: Like, "yeah I know."

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:32.860
And it's like, oh!

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:34.180
Like oh dear.

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:38.500
You know, and it's just yeah it's
just part of life of being awkward

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:41.210
and you know and especially
where you're falling

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:44.080
in love you're infatuated,
you're so awkward

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.580
because you're so vulnerable.

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:48.580
You know, and I was trying to think
of the stories that I read growing

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:51.120
up and you know there just
weren't a lot of stories

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:55.590
for teenagers I think, so I think
that's why we don't remember

00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:58.930
that part of the story,
you know, from the past.

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:02.340
Like it is something maybe we're
bringing in because why it's

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:05.860
so much bigger now and we can tell
longer books and you know kind

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:08.850
of go deeper into the
teen experience.

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:10.150
&gt;&gt; Awkwardness.

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:11.450
&gt;&gt; Melissa de la Cruz: Deeper
into awkwardness definitely.

00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:12.880 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Same thing for me.

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:17.250
I think like I'm naturally a
pretty awkward person and even

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:20.690
when I was a teen I was like, I
was always the one who would trip,

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:23.040
you know, at the most
inopportune time.

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.690
You know, going up to get my
diploma and you know that kind

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:30.450
of thing is horrible, and one of
my favorite words is "adorkable:"

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:35.000
And I think like, I think that
captures that so perfectly,

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.950
because it so relatable when
people are you know embarrassed

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:41.340
and they immerse themselves
and they still,

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:44.770
they're just putting themselves out
there and they're so vulnerable.

00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:47.220
I mean, I think that
absolutely needs to be in,

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:48.910
especially in teen books.

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:50.210
&gt;&gt; Nicola Yoon: Yeah,
because you do make it

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:51.510
out through the other side right?

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:55.720
I mean, like if you have
that awkward moment maybe he

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:59.510
or she is having the awkward
moment too and then it's cute.

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:00.810
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:03.760
&gt;&gt; Nicola Yoon: And then you end
up together and have five children.

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:05.060
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:06.360
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:07.660
&gt;&gt; Abby McGanney Nolan:
I'll open it up soon.

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:09.550
I want to just ask a
couple more questions

00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:14.590
and I think there are
microphones on different sides.

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:16.060
I don't see them though.

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:21.040
But, in terms of the We
Need Diverse Books Movement,

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:26.220 position:56%
you all address cultural differences
and in the United States,

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:32.100 position:56%
as well as, some very serious social
issues amid the love and awkwardness

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:36.100
and I was wondering is it
something that you are thinking

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:39.790
about for future projects
too at this point or,

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:43.940
I know you also had a
novel about deportation.

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:45.500
About a girl who's.

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:50.600
&gt;&gt; Melissa de la Cruz: You know,
it's amazing to me to sit here

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:53.110
and to be in this industry.

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:56.790
I've been a writer for
about twenty years now

00:24:56.790 --> 00:25:00.850
and when I was starting out,
you know, the only Asian writer

00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:06.140
that I knew was Amy Tan and I would
write my query letters to agents

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:09.410
and to publishers saying like,
I want to be like Amy Tan

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:13.600
because she was the only writer
I knew of color from, you know,

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:17.590
kind of my background;
I'm part Chinese

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:21.870
and to see you know the
growth in the industry

00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:25.210
to celebrate the diversity
and the American story,

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:27.280
it's overwhelming really.

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:30.840
It's a, I'm so happy that
we've made so many strides.

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:32.460
I'm hoping we make more.

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:38.400 position:56%
You know, there's always more to do,
but yeah I mean I stared out writing

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:42.000
about you know, I started with
a book called "The Au Pairs"

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.570
and it was with a company called
Alloy and they were a company

00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:49.300
that made "Sweet Valley
High" which was one

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:51.550
of my favorite book
series growing up.

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:53.990
And I was like "Oh, my god
I writing Sweet Valley High"

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:55.290
but for a new generation.

00:25:55.290 --> 00:26:00.050
And I always was trying to put in
you know at least one character

00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:05.350
who wasn't just oh anglosex, you
know, and so I had the Brazil nanny

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:08.850
and I was like okay, so you know
we'll go from there, you know.

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:13.710
So, and to write and I was actually
approached to write a novel about,

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:18.000
about an undocumented
immigrant teenager.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.060
It's called "Something In Between"
and it's about a Filipino girl

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:24.430
who discovers that her
family is here illegally

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:27.790
and I actually didn't even want
to write it because it's so,

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:30.740
it just reminded me
of being vulnerable.

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:36.810
My family came here in 1985 and
my parents got their green card

00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:40.070
and we were here legally, but
back then there was no law

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:44.100
for the adult children, almost
like the dreamers basically

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.330
who were brought here as minors.

00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:48.820
So, my sister and I were
over the age twenty-one

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:53.830 position:56%
when my family got their green cards
and there was nothing, there was no,

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:57.140
there was no law that covered
us even though we were brought

00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:58.440
here legally.

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:01.110
And so our lawyer said, just wait.

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:04.320
You know, you're just going
to have to wait and I waited,

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:06.510 position:56%
I was forty when I got my green card

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:08.050
and I was brought here
when I was thirteen.

00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:10.810
It was so crazy to me.

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:13.450
So, I didn't want to
revisit those feelings

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:16.530 position:56%
of being feeling vulnerable,
feeling like I wasn't quite American

00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:20.730
on paper, but I was glad that I did
it and I was glad I wrote the book,

00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:25.450
so, and I was glad that they
asked for it basically, so.

00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:29.060
&gt;&gt; Nicola Yoon: Yeah, I mean so
this is like a topic I won't talk

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:32.370
about for everyone, but
yeah and when I was growing

00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:34.770
up I didn't see girls that looked
like me in the books, right.

00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:39.820
There were just not that many of
us, and you know, "The Bluest Eye"

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:44.250
by Toni Morrison I think is the
first time that I saw a girl

00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:46.120
that looked like me and
I didn't really know

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:49.850
that you could write stories with
like a Black girl main character.

00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:54.910
And then one of the movies that I
loved the most is Harold and Kumar,

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:58.070
right this is like, that was
a life changing movie for me,

00:27:58.070 --> 00:28:03.260
because it was basically my
college experience right.

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:07.140
So, it's just these goofy kids
who were not stereotypes at all

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:11.710
who they just got to hangout and be
silly and have all the same hopes

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:16.020
and dreams as everyone else and
be sort of dorky in the same way,

00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:20.150
and you know, and want better
things in the same way.

00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:23.420
So, I mean when I write
books now I mean I write it

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:24.910
against the stereotypes.

00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:29.410
I write the people I know,
we live in a diverse world.

00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:32.480
The job of writers
is to tell the truth

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:33.950
and that is just the truth, right.

00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:35.500
We live in a diverse world.

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:38.930
The world is better and more
beautiful because it's diverse,

00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:42.840
so I mean those are the
stories I will always tell

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:47.150
and I didn't want my little girl
to grow up with not seeing herself

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:49.180
in books, and so when
I wrote "Everything,

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:53.070
Everything" I made the main
character look like her.

00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:56.800
And one of the best things
that happened was when I went

00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:00.670
to the movie set and I took my
little girl and she met Amandla

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:03.130
and literally the first thing
she said to me was like,

00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:04.770
"Oh she looks just like me."

00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:07.310
I mean and I just cried, right,

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:10.420
I cried a lot on that movie set
let me tell you, because there was

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:13.540
like a moments like that,
but you know, I've now;

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:16.250
now my little girl knows
like she gets to be the hero

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:18.580
of the story right and
everyone deserves that,

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:22.260
like everyone should be able
to see themselves as the hero

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:24.440
and slay the dragon and
get the girl or the boy

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:32.160 position:56%
and you know be the main
character, so that is my whole deal.

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:33.510
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Same as them,

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:36.980
I plan to keep writing a
lot more diverse stories.

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:40.910
I think one of the big things
for me too, I have kids as well

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:43.890
and my daughter is eight; she
recently came home and said

00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:46.390
that she had drawn a brown princess

00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:50.800
and her friend told her
princesses can only be white.

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:53.790
And so, I think I have
to have that conversation

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:57.810
and Nicola recently wrote an
article, a very similar topic

00:29:57.810 --> 00:30:03.160
about princesses need to be so many
different colors and it's 20017

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:06.800
and we're still having these
conversations, and the only way

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:09.070
to stop having those
conversations is

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:12.620
to make sure kids are seeing
themselves all different kinds

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:15.970
of kids are seeing themselves
on book covers and TV shows

00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:19.990
and storybooks, and so that's why
I'm so passionate about it just

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:23.510
like these ladies and like
I don't plan to stop, so.

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:29.500
[ Applause ]

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:33.080
&gt;&gt; Abby McGanney Nolan: So, I think
we can open it up to questions

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:34.730
if people have questions.

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:39.840
I also, I wanted to,
I forgot to mention

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:44.740
that everyone will be signing
books on the lower level

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:51.710 position:56%
between two and three; 2 pm to 3 pm.

00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:59.460
So, I can't really see very
well, but do you want to start?

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:04.010
&gt;&gt; How do you know when a
book idea is a good one?

00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:05.320
&gt;&gt; Melissa de la Cruz: I,
you know, I can feel it.

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:08.910
You know, I remember my
daughter being really interested

00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:11.790
in Elizabeth Schuyler and
then I just right then came

00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:14.190
up with the title, I said I want
to call it "Alex and Eliza",

00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:15.920
because he was never called Alex.

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:18.840
You know, he was either
Hamilton or Alexander, you know,

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:23.730
that Alex is such a casual,
you know, he was not an Alex.

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:28.110 position:56%
But Alex was my character, you know,
based on this historical figure

00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:30.250
and I thought by calling it "Alex

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:34.710
and Eliza" you know I was really
kind of staking my fictional claim

00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:40.250
on this story and, you know, I
just thought "Oh my god, this one."

00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:44.010
You know, I kind of knew and,
although I didn't know it,

00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:45.500
I didn't know it would
be this successful.

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:48.930
We were hoping for one
good week, you know, so.

00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:50.230
You never know.

00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:55.340 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Nicola Yoon: I keep an "Ideas"
notebook and I write everything down

00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:58.420
and then the ones I keep going back
to over and over and like flushing

00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:00.780
out a little bit, are
the ones I tend to write

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:04.840
like either a short story about or
I put; I write really short fiction

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:08.070
to like short stories,
so that's how I know.

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:10.890
Like the ones I keep going back
to and thinking about like a lot

00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:12.250
of them fade away and I just like,

00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:14.480
"Oh that was just a cool
idea for that moment."

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:18.530
But the ones that I stick to,
are the ones that become books.

00:32:18.530 --> 00:32:19.830 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Yeah, same for me.

00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:21.800
I have an "Ideas" folder
on my computer

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:24.740
and usually it's just one
line, but then if I transfer it

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:27.580
to an actually notebook and start
writing more about the characters

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:30.330 position:56%
than I know there's something there.

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:31.630
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:32.930
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Thank you.

00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:34.230
&gt;&gt; Abby McGanney Nolan:
On this side.

00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:36.560
&gt;&gt; Hi, so I was just wondering you,

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:38.810
you're in like a very
competitive genre of course,

00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:40.780
that's why it has become
so flushed out.

00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:46.970
How do you write in like nuance and
new ways, in unique ways about such

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:48.900
like a common phenomenon love?

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:51.470
Like everyone wants to
read about something

00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:53.220
that they feel like
only they've felt.

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:57.480
How do you create that
feeling in your works?

00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:59.400
&gt;&gt; Nicola Yoon: That's
a great question.

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:02.480
I think, I can't remember who said
this, so I'm not even going to try,

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:07.630
but like fiction is about making
the familiar strange, right?

00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:10.600
Or making you feel, you
know, making you feel

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:13.940
like you're the one that's
first ever felt this,

00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:15.740 position:56%
and all love is very specific right?

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:19.860
When you fall in love with someone
that's kind, but everyone's kind

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:21.720
in different ways and
you fall in love with,

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:24.920 position:56%
particularly if that person is kind.

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:30.200
And I think it's about the
specificity, right, so like for me

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:33.440 position:56%
when I'm writing two characters that
they're not falling in love generic

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:35.810 position:56%
and it's not falling in love, right?

00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:39.760
They like that person because
they smiled back a certain way

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:45.380
or they're goofy this way
and I mean just the idea

00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:46.740
of what is sexy, right?

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:50.750
Like we're both, we're all
going to find three different;

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:54.360
although Jason Momoa I feel
like is universal right?

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:58.280
I was just having this
conversation with someone the Rock

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:01.410
versus Jason Momoa and
I'm like, "Jason Momoa."

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:02.720
I mean like [brief laughter].

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:07.200
Sorry. But, yeah I think
it's about specificity

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:10.410
and I think that's what
makes a difference.

00:34:10.410 --> 00:34:15.540
&gt;&gt; Melissa de la Cruz: Oh, yeah,
no I mean, it's interesting

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:19.150
that you said it was a
competitive genre so basically

00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:23.560
like how do you stand out, and
you know while it is competitive,

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:27.140
writing itself is not competitive
and art is not competitive,

00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:31.110 position:56%
so the market is competitive but you
know it's really you and the book

00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:35.020
and you know I think we all
write you know for ourselves.

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:38.430
I mean, I always, I think the
people make the mistake of writing

00:34:38.430 --> 00:34:41.800
for an audience or this kind
of amorphous group of readers.

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:43.490
Like I write to entertain myself.

00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:46.700
So if don't like it and
I'm not, I'm not laughing

00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:49.040
or I'm not swooning, who is?

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:52.670
You know, so I really, I only care
about my first reader which is me.

00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:56.250
So, all these books are for me.

00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:59.150
I'm glad you like them too, but.

00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:04.050 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And do you write for your younger
self or always for yourself now?

00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:06.620
&gt;&gt; Melissa de la Cruz: I think
I still am my younger self.

00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:09.350
You know, I still remember
like everybody I have a grudge

00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:12.710 position:56%
against like it's been thirty years.

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:15.580
Like I remember and they
come and see me on Facebook.

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:16.880
I'm like really?

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:18.670
I remember at lunch.

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:20.150
You know.

00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:23.670
&gt;&gt; Nicola Yoon: You do not
want to mess with Melissa.

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:28.040
&gt;&gt; Melissa de la Cruz: Oh, no,
no, no I will come later you know.

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:29.340
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:30.640
&gt;&gt; Melissa de la Cruz: Yep.

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:34.910
&gt;&gt; So, I was wondering
like a lot of people have

00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:39.370
like a favorite tool they like
to use when they're writing,

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:43.530
like Spotify or Excel or Blue
Maps I was wondering what's yours?

00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:46.880
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: I love Scribner.

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:49.850
It's a writing software
that you can install

00:35:49.850 --> 00:35:54.940 position:56%
and like it has these little, I
guess they are like fake index cards

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:57.480
that you can move around
on a corkboard

00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:01.390 position:56%
and there are different folders for
like research and character building

00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:03.140
and world building all that stuff,

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:04.890
and it keeps me really
nice and organized.

00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:07.510
I love that one.

00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:11.240
&gt;&gt; Nicola Yoon: So, I write by
hand into Moleskin notebooks.

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:12.990
I guess my tool is
I get [inaudible].

00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:15.100
I write into the notebook.

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:21.170
I eat a lot of kettle corn,
like seriously absurd amounts

00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:27.840 position:56%
of kettle corn and then drink a lot
of tea; those are my, my must haves.

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:31.110
&gt;&gt; Melissa de la Cruz: I
want to learn Scribner.

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:33.900
Like that's been on my
list like, but I can't,

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:36.070
I write on Microsoft Word.

00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:38.190
I usually write in silence.

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:40.510
I actually, I had a
day job for nine years.

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:41.910
I was a computer programmer

00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:44.520
and I would write my
books, you know, at my job.

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:48.700
And so I find an office environment
really soothing and the sound

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:51.650 position:56%
of type; people typing on
keyboards and murmuring into phones,

00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:54.750
so I'm always joking about
I want to go to like a bank

00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:56.220 position:56%
and just "Can I sit here and write?"

00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:59.320
You know, because that's
like my, that's what I need.

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:02.780
But yeah, I write in
silence basically.

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:04.210
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:05.790
&gt;&gt; Okay, this side?

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:08.720
Who is your favorite
Schuyler sister?

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:12.630
&gt;&gt; Melissa de la Cruz:
Oh, Eliza of course.

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:14.910
No, definitely Eliza.

00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:16.210
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:20.940
&gt;&gt; So, I'm a writer and I've always
kind of wanted to do something

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:23.690
with multiple perspectives
and so when you do

00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:25.660
like dual perspective
writing what's your process?

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:31.790
Like do you alternate or do you
do each perspective all at once?

00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:33.090
&gt;&gt; Nicola Yoon: I alternate

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:36.870
because that's how the story
is unfolding in my head.

00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:41.980
I don't know if you guys saw Subba
speak earlier, but she was talking

00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:44.390
about this too, where the first;

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:48.660 position:56%
you don't necessarily get the voices
right the first time you're writing,

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:49.960
right.

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:52.060
I mean, everyone always talks
about the big bad first draft

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:55.750
where the book is terrible
and it really is terrible

00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:59.950 position:56%
for the first draft, but you know,
like voice can come in later, right.

00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:03.540 position:56%
You can just have those stories
going, you know, like the mechanics,

00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:06.780
the plot just what, what
is actually in the story

00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:09.120
and then put the voices in later.

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:12.370
For me, I do practical
things like in "Everything,

00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:15.560
Everything" Olly doesn't
believe in grammar, right.

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:18.620
I mean, he like never met a
capital letter that he liked

00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:20.430
or a punctuation mark, right.

00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:23.360
So, that was a really good way
for me just to get into his head,

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:25.840
because he just never
used punctuation.

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:29.030
Whereas, Maddy was like
very grammatically correct.

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:32.580
So, like physically changing
the text for me helped me get

00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:38.060
into their head, and similarly
in Sun Star, you know,

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:42.110
Daniel would write poetry
and Natasha would write

00:38:42.110 --> 00:38:45.520
down scientific facts and so that
helped me get into their head.

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:50.440
So, just practical things is a
good way to trick yourself in how

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:53.160
to get into someone's head.

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:54.460
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:56.630
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: I like to plot
out the character's arcs first.

00:38:56.630 --> 00:39:01.600
So, I get to know them really well
before I start even like writing

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:04.060
and then I just, I don't think

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:06.730
about like oh I need to
switch at this point.

00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:09.100
You know, I'll write that
character's point of view

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:13.870
until they're done with that piece
and then so I didn't have like,

00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:15.740
you know, I didn't have a
thousand words for Dimple

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:17.040
and a thousand words for Rishi.

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:20.180
I just did it as it felt
natural and let it come

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:23.440
to a natural stopping
point before I'd switch.

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:24.770
&gt;&gt; Melissa de la Cruz:
Yeah, I do both.

00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:27.480
I would do alternate and
then I would just get

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:30.250
into somebody's POV really deep

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:34.130 position:56%
and I would just write the next five
chapters or however much, you know,

00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:38.200
in that voice and then go back in
and write the other characters.

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:41.450
So, it would just depend on you
know where I, what my mood was.

00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:44.130
Usually in the beginning of the
book, I do a lot of alternates

00:39:44.130 --> 00:39:45.880
and then as I'm going to the end,

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:49.310
I just write in one character
all the way through then go back

00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:51.770
in and write the other one.

00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:54.630
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:57.580
&gt;&gt; So, I know when
I write I get a lot

00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:00.050
of like influences
from outside sources.

00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:03.610
I know you mentioned you got a
lot of inspiration from "Hamilton"

00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:06.450
because you're daughter liked
it and you saw the musical,

00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:10.770
so how do you take that
time and separate your story

00:40:10.770 --> 00:40:14.040
from like the outside inspiration
you get it from to make it unique?

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:19.430
&gt;&gt; Melissa de la Cruz: Yeah,
you know, I mean inspiration

00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:25.930
and then execution is different and
you know while I was in inspired

00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:29.650
by the musical, I didn't
want to write that story.

00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:32.290
Like I wanted to write; I knew
from the beginning I wanted

00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:33.590
to write a different story.

00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:36.350
I wanted to write a "Pride
and Prejudice" style story.

00:40:36.350 --> 00:40:38.080
I wanted to write about the women.

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:44.570 position:56%
So, I did a lot of research of women
in revolutionary America, you know,

00:40:44.570 --> 00:40:48.300
not just a Elizabeth Schuyler's
biography, but Martha Washington's,

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:51.400
Martha Jefferson's, you know,
I wanted to really learn

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:52.780
about you know what did they eat?

00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:54.080
You know, what did they wear?

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:55.380
What did they dance to?

00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:56.960
You know, it was, it
was amazing to me

00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:59.490
that while the American
Revolution was happening in France,

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:01.370
it was Maria Antoinette
in Versailles.

00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:03.960
You know, this totally different,
you know, you think like oh my god

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:06.540
that was during the same time.

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:08.670
And, yeah, I don't know.

00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:11.600
I think, you know,
it's not interesting

00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:14.250
for me to write the same story.

00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:17.580
I think what interests me,
you know, I read something

00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:19.540
that somebody said once,
I can't remember who,

00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:22.270
that all art is a conversation
with each other.

00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:25.370
So, it's like a conversation you
know not just with "Hamilton",

00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:28.980
but with "Pride and Prejudice"
you know all these other you know

00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:34.440 position:56%
wonderful books that I love and
then from there, you write your own.

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:37.230
You know, I definitely
had my own idea.

00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:38.530
You know, one of the big things

00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:42.920
in "Hamilton" is Lin-Manuel's
interpretation

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:46.960
of it is Angelica you know
was in love with Alexander

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:48.810
and possibly they had an affair.

00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:51.990
You know, he doesn't really make
that clear, but there's definitely,

00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:56.320
you know, something there, but
I you know I watched the musical

00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:58.110
and then I read all the letters

00:41:58.110 --> 00:42:01.040
and I thought there's no
way that they had an affair.

00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:02.590
She loved Eliza.

00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:04.240
They loved each other so much.

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:06.690
You could never do that
to your sister, you know,

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:09.410
and I was like you know when
you have a; and have a sister

00:42:09.410 --> 00:42:12.530
and I was just like, you
know, I just couldn't see it.

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:16.420
I could see loving the same person,
you know, and wanting, you know,

00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:19.620
sharing that love,
but not in that way.

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:21.270
That would be such a huge betrayal.

00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:24.420
So, in my story that's
not part of it.

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:27.620
You know, Angelica is much
more protective, you know,

00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:30.460
and yes she's witty and
clever and all that,

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:34.040
but she's really interested
in status and in making sure

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:36.520
that her life is very
comfortable, you know,

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:38.820
whereas that Hamilton
struggled all the time.

00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:40.430
I mean, he wasn't a landowner.

00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:44.020 position:56%
I mean, he, they lived on their
salary you know and whatever she got

00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:48.390
from her rich family you
know it was not enough

00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:50.170
to support their lifestyle.

00:42:50.170 --> 00:42:53.670
You know, even when he died they
were in debt and she had to,

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:56.480
you know, the government you
know helped them you know

00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:58.400
with their life basically.

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:00.890
She was like, you know,
you kind of owe us.

00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:02.870
So, you know, so that
was really interesting.

00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:06.130
I also liked that he was
always in debt as a writer.

00:43:06.130 --> 00:43:10.580
I was like, he's a real
writer; always in debt.

00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:15.170 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Nicola Yoon: So, are you
worried about like copying something

00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:16.670
because your inspired by it?

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:18.800
Is that where your
question is coming from?

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:21.290
&gt;&gt; No. I kind of like just
like want to make it my own.

00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:22.670
It's not like copying it.

00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:23.970
&gt;&gt; Nicola Yoon: Right.

00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:26.520
&gt;&gt; I feel like at some points it's
too close to where it comes from.

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:27.820
&gt;&gt; Nicola Yoon: Right, yeah.

00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:29.490
&gt;&gt; I just want to make
it my own, like.

00:43:29.490 --> 00:43:30.790
&gt;&gt; Nicola Yoon: Right.

00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:34.850
So, I mean I think that is when
I was like a new writer too,

00:43:34.850 --> 00:43:37.560
I would absolutely copy things.

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:41.540
Not like intentionally, right,
but I would get inspired so much.

00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:43.620
I would fall in love with
that writing so much that I,

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:45.900
it would take that style.

00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:47.420
Sometimes unconsciously

00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:51.030
and sometimes you know quite
deliberately and that is okay.

00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:52.330
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:43:52.330 --> 00:43:53.630
&gt;&gt; Nicola Yoon: Like that
is how you learn, right?

00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:55.190
Because you, the fact is
you're never going to write

00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:57.030
like if Hemingway is your
thing, you're never going

00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:59.690
to write exactly Hemingway,
but you can learn a lot

00:43:59.690 --> 00:44:04.080
by you know just immersing
yourself in it and trying.

00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:07.310
But you, and then that is a
way of finding your own voice.

00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:12.210
So, I mean I like my baby
writer self-copied everything

00:44:12.210 --> 00:44:15.080
and I learned a ton and
now I write the way I write

00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:20.640 position:56%
which is definitely me, but I
learned that by reading a lot and by

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:23.050
like absolutely imitating
for a longtime.

00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:24.350
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:44:24.350 --> 00:44:25.650
&gt;&gt; Nicola Yoon: So, it's okay.

00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:26.950
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Yeah, me too.

00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:28.250
I used to write these
embarrassing stories

00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:29.550
that were exactly like
Sophie Kinsella.

00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:32.450
Like I mean you wouldn't be
able tell the difference.

00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:35.700
And because I love her books
so much and that was okay

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:38.650
and I decided this is going
to be like fan fiction, right?

00:44:38.650 --> 00:44:39.950
It's okay.

00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:42.780
And so I did a few books like that
and then eventually I kind of grew

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:44.800
out of it and started
doing it my own way,

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:46.400
and I think you'll get there too.

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:47.700
&gt;&gt; Nicola Yoon: Yeah.

00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:49.000
Just keep going.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.300
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Yeah.

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:51.600
&gt;&gt; Nicola Yoon: You'll find it.

00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:52.900
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:54.200
&gt;&gt; Nicola Yoon: Sure.

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:55.500
&gt;&gt; Is this it?

00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:56.980
Hi. I was going to ask a question
about how does your family

00:44:56.980 --> 00:45:03.390
and your character's family
influence your character's romance?

00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:04.810
&gt;&gt; Melissa de la Cruz: Interesting.

00:45:04.810 --> 00:45:07.250
&gt;&gt; Nicola Yoon: I mean,
mine is pretty direct.

00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:10.550
Like I am for sure in
love with my husband.

00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:14.470
I think he's the coolest
thing on like, you know,

00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:16.080
he's just the best boy on earth.

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:20.000
So, like a lot of our
conversations are in my books,

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000
like Olly hates the ocean.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.350
He's terrified of it.

00:45:24.350 --> 00:45:26.690
My husband grew up in
southern California

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:30.100
and is terrified of the ocean.

00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:34.670
Like in the story, like there's
an entire conversation in the book

00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:37.440
that is probably verbatim
from our conversations.

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:40.790
So, I, but because my
characters fall into,

00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:42.790
they fall in love just by talking.

00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:46.560
It's not so much the physical,
although there's a lot of kissing,

00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:49.960
but they really like each
other's brains and so a lot

00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:54.390
of that is in my books, talking.

00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:58.170
&gt;&gt; Melissa de la Cruz: Yeah, you're
all in love with our husbands.

00:45:58.170 --> 00:46:02.270
I mean, you know, and I
mean you write what you know

00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:06.330 position:56%
and like you said, like that
conversations are verbatim, totally.

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:09.580
You know, I totally steal from our
life and I put it in the books,

00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:15.010
and I like you know I mean,
he's the guy I know the most,

00:46:15.010 --> 00:46:17.280
you know, I know him so well.

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:21.730
So, you know a lot of my
male protagonies are based

00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:26.640
on certain aspects of his character
in the way he reacts to things,

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:28.560 position:56%
you know, you can tell him he knows.

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.220
He's like, it's all about me.

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:31.980
But, you know, funny
my family though,

00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:34.800
because I've written two
books about Filipino families.

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:38.060
I have a book called "Fresh
off the Boat" which was based

00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:40.140
on our immigration story.

00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:42.180
It's about a family that
moves from the Philippines.

00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:44.460
I wanted to set in the
80s, but they said no,

00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:47.420
so it's set in the current time.

00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:50.150
And my daughter read it and
you know she wanted to know

00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:55.480 position:56%
who all the characters were and the
only people who are not in my books;

00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:59.270
my mom and my dad are in that
book, but I changed the siblings

00:46:59.270 --> 00:47:02.350
because my siblings were like
never, ever write about us.

00:47:02.350 --> 00:47:05.950
Never! So, they are
not in it anywhere.

00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:08.360
You know, because they
know what writers do,

00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:12.410
so they don't want any part of
that and I have to respect that.

00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:13.710 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Yeah, same for me.

00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:15.880
I love the idea of
like selfless love.

00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:17.890
I think my husband is
really good at that.

00:47:17.890 --> 00:47:19.850
Like just putting my needs over his

00:47:19.850 --> 00:47:23.480
and just thoughtfully doing these
things and I love that and so

00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:27.180
in my books I'm, you know,
this one and the future ones,

00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:31.050
I always like to have scenes where
somebody does something really nice

00:47:31.050 --> 00:47:32.450
for the person they
love and the person

00:47:32.450 --> 00:47:34.680
who they love doesn't
necessarily know about it,

00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:39.200
but it's just like a very
generous and sweet thing, so yeah.

00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:40.500
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:41.800
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Great.

00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:45.510
&gt;&gt; Hi. So, as an aspiring writer
I always have like one scene

00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:46.830
that I really, really want to write

00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:49.830
and how do you build-up
to that in romance?

00:47:49.830 --> 00:47:52.550
Because I know romance is a lot
of little things that build-up

00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:57.580
to like a climax; how
do you build that?

00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:00.710
&gt;&gt; Melissa de la Cruz:
That is a great question.

00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:04.300
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: I like this idea
of candy bar scenes and I get this

00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:09.590 position:56%
from a writer called Holly Lisle,
but she talks about candy bar scenes

00:48:09.590 --> 00:48:11.860
which are just like you
brainstorm these scenes

00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:14.290
that you're really excited
to write and it doesn't have

00:48:14.290 --> 00:48:16.520
to be the huge ultimate
climatic scene.

00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:18.840
It can be just little
things along the way

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:22.820
that you feel would be just fun
to write as a writer, you know?

00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:25.380
And so, those are the
ones that I plot first

00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:28.490
and that gets me really
excited and usually I will start

00:48:28.490 --> 00:48:31.520
to see a pattern form like, oh
this is how this book is going

00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:34.730
to play out, or the love story
is going to play out, you know?

00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:37.250
And so, that's what I like to do.

00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:38.550
Yeah.

00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:40.680
&gt;&gt; Nicola Yoon: Yeah, I mean I
think it's a couple of questions

00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:45.360
that have sort of led me to think
that you have to actually keep

00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:47.850
in mind that books are
made in revision, right.

00:48:47.850 --> 00:48:49.880
They really are not
made in the first draft.

00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:54.090 position:56%
I was talking to my friend Subba the
other night and we're both suffering

00:48:54.090 --> 00:48:58.920
through our books, and I
said, like we have careers,

00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:01.890
because we're good at revision.

00:49:01.890 --> 00:49:03.750
That is, like I mean
it's true, right.

00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:06.320
I don't have a career because
I'm good at first drafting,

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:07.900
because I am not good at it.

00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:10.480
And honestly, most writers
are not good at it, right?

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:13.920
You're just telling yourself the
story, so that scene that you want

00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:17.240
to build toward, it might
be the third revision

00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:19.470
that you build towards
it correctly, right.

00:49:19.470 --> 00:49:21.950
It doesn't happen on
the first draft.

00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:23.800
You're telling yourself the
story in the first draft;

00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:28.030
it's supposed to be terrible, it
is terrible, suffer through it.

00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:33.690
Call your friends, have them give
you chocolate and then be good

00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:38.990
at revision, because that's the job
actually is to be good at revision.

00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:40.290
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Yeah.

00:49:40.290 --> 00:49:41.770
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:49:41.770 --> 00:49:48.040
&gt;&gt; In "The Sun Is Also a
Star" why did you decide

00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:49.750
to create the character Irene?

00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:54.880
&gt;&gt; Nicola Yoon: You
know, people love Irene.

00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:56.180
She comes up a lot.

00:49:56.180 --> 00:49:58.570 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Melissa de la Cruz: I love Irene.

00:49:58.570 --> 00:50:04.250
&gt;&gt; Nicola Yoon: So, I can't;
it's a hard question to answer

00:50:04.250 --> 00:50:08.280
because I don't want to
spoil what happens to Irene.

00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:11.660
But, I will say that one of the
things I really wanted to talk

00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:15.780
about in the book is that
we, like as a society,

00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:20.340
live these very big lives, like a
very full you know your kids have

00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:23.720
to go to school and they have
to have lunch and you have

00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:27.020
to have a job and, and you're
on the subway and the person

00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:29.380
across the way looks different from
you and you think you have nothing

00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:34.720
in common with them and we have
these big very, very busy lives

00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:38.620
and we don't have, we don't find
ways to connect a lot and we think

00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:42.590
that we're really so different,
but it isn't true, right?

00:50:42.590 --> 00:50:45.100
That person next to you or
that stranger that you think is

00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:50.150
so different than you, has the
same sort of impulses and dreams.

00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:52.630
You have more in common
than you think you do.

00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:55.030
And one of the things I wanted
to say with this book is

00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:59.630
that if we can all like just
take a breath and see each other

00:50:59.630 --> 00:51:02.470
and maybe talk to each other
and be a little bit kind,

00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:05.520
we would get to know that we have
more in common than we don't,

00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:08.350
and so that's where Irene is from.

00:51:08.350 --> 00:51:11.510
Like Irene seems like
a passing character,

00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:15.210
but a kind word saves her, right,
and I think that that is true

00:51:15.210 --> 00:51:18.600
that we can do that for each
other, for strangers every day,

00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:22.350
you can just have a kind word,
"nice tie", "thank you", "please

00:51:22.350 --> 00:51:25.150
and hold the door", and you
can change someone's whole day

00:51:25.150 --> 00:51:27.000
and their whole life.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.700
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:51:31.090 --> 00:51:33.690
&gt;&gt; Abby McGanney Nolan: We have
time for I think one more question.

00:51:33.690 --> 00:51:36.590
&gt;&gt; Nicola, my Book
Club kids love you.

00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:37.890
&gt;&gt; Nicola Yoon: Oh, yeah.

00:51:37.890 --> 00:51:39.240
&gt;&gt; They would die that I'm here.

00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:40.540
&gt;&gt; Nicola Yoon: Thank you.

00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:41.840
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:43.140
&gt;&gt; Nicola Yoon: Thank you.

00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:46.440
&gt;&gt; And, my question is what
kind of research did you do

00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:50.630
for "The Sun Is Also a Star?"

00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:52.420
&gt;&gt; Nicola Yoon: Let'
see, what's in that book?

00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:53.720
Like immigration.

00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:56.280
I did a lot of, I wrote a lot

00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:59.620
of immigration documents
which is not exciting.

00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:02.950
I will tell you it's very boring.

00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:05.590
But, you know, the main character,

00:52:05.590 --> 00:52:09.770
one of the main characters is
Korean-American and so I'm married

00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:13.400
to someone who's Korean-American,
so a lot of that I know just

00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:16.510
from because we've been married
for fifteen years, but you know,

00:52:16.510 --> 00:52:20.600
I actually had my Korean-American
friends read the book too.

00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:24.180
So, I had people read it to make
sure I didn't get things wrong

00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:27.220
about like sort of the
Korean-American experience,

00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:30.380
but also just like basic things
like "Would have that for breakfast

00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:32.770
if you were a Korean immigrant?"

00:52:32.770 --> 00:52:36.040
You know, like so I did research
in that way and made sure

00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:37.460
that there weren't anything;

00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:40.990
there weren't terrible
stereotypes in the book.

00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:43.850
So, that's probably the biggest
part of the research I did

00:52:43.850 --> 00:52:45.990
for that book is like
trying to get the sort

00:52:45.990 --> 00:52:49.750 position:56%
of Korean-American experience right.

00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:51.050
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:52:51.050 --> 00:52:52.350
Thank you.

thank you so much for coming,

00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:56.560

talking about your books,

00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:58.130
and life, and thank you guys.
