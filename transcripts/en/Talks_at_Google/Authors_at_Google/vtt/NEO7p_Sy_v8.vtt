[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.485 --> 00:00:09.170
TANIA KATAN: Thank you.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:10.038
Thank you, Natasha.

00:00:10.038 --> 00:00:11.330
NATASHA: I have a cape for you.

00:00:14.912 --> 00:00:16.870
TANIA KATAN: I mean,
that's the stance you take

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:17.995
when you're getting a cape.

00:00:17.995 --> 00:00:21.140
I don't want to be rude.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.640
Thank you.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.650
And I want you to
know-- thanks to Natasha

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.037
and, also, I typically
wear my cape on the inside.

00:00:27.037 --> 00:00:28.870
So, if you don't have
a cape on the outside,

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.610
you can keep it on the inside.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.110
Am I amplified and
ready to rock and roll?

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.760
Yeah.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.860
OK, so, what we're
going to do today

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.130
is we're going to test the
limits of what is probable,

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.190
what is profitable,
and what is possible

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.130
when we bring our imagination
to the workspace--

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.230
when we bring our
imagination to our homes,

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.100
when we bring our imagination
to the streets, when

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.930
we bring our imagination
to a Talks at Google.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.250
What?

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.942
So, instead of starting
at the beginning,

00:00:58.942 --> 00:01:00.400
we're going to
start at the ending.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.233
So, please stand up.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.260
OK.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.890
On the count of
three, you are going

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.350
to give yourselves
and each other

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.500
the best standing
ovation you have in you.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.208
One, two, three.

00:01:18.208 --> 00:01:26.672
[CHEERING]

00:01:26.672 --> 00:01:27.172
Yeah!

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.146
Woo!

00:01:33.146 --> 00:01:33.646
Woo!

00:01:36.634 --> 00:01:39.130
OK.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.550
OK, OK.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:41.700
OK.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.370
You can sit down physically,
but stay standing emotionally

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.680
for the whole time.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.930
So, I want you to
remember that all of us

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.940
here have and will dare
to share our wildest ideas

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.410
and will be a little scared.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.550
Or we will deign to raise our
hands at an all hands meeting

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.650
and share an idea
that scares us.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.710
Or, we might be taking the
stage and giving a presentation

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.310
and we're a little freaked out.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.250
And so, you can
remember this moment

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.460
when we all gave each other and
ourselves a standing ovation,

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.050
and you can take that with you.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.010
OK?

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.540
So, I have spent
the last 10 years

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.570
consciously bringing
creativity into the work

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.400
space and imagination.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.100
And I'm talking about
when I've worked

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.630
and before that a little
less consciously--

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.620
I hadn't really developed this
idea of creative trespassing.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.990
But when I was
bagging groceries,

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.030
when I worked at
it as a barista,

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.630
when I worked in a museum,
when I worked in technology.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.040
And, as I got more conscious
about this infusing imagination

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.490
and creativity, I started
to notice two things that

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.600
were really astounding to me.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.270
And the first
thing is is that we

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.900
don't need to work in
a job or a field that

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.410
is uniquely creative
in order to be uniquely

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.000
creative within our work.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.620
And the second
thing that I learned

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.350
is that if we bring
imagination to confront

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.610
our self-limiting beliefs,
obstacles, everyday challenges,

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.750
that we will experience
unlimited solutions, ideas,

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.040
and innovations.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.700
True story, news at 10.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.318
I'm done.

00:03:21.318 --> 00:03:22.860
And that's what
compelled me to write

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.690
this book "Creative
Trespassing," which

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:25.350
I'll show you--

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.570
oh, my gosh, it's so red
and white and fantastic.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.130
OK, and so, what I
want to my talk today

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.550
is really about some
moments or stories

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.590
where I learned to see my
self-limits as opportunities

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.000
to creatively trespass-- to
maybe add something that wasn't

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.248
there and enliven not just
myself, but colleagues

00:03:48.248 --> 00:03:50.040
and the mission and
vision of the companies

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.850
that I worked for.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.270
So, anybody here go to
contemporary art museums?

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.390
OK, about 50%.

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.940
And somebody is like, meh,
only if it's free day.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.570
That's fine.

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:03.560
That's fine.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.310
I sort of felt like, meh,
when somebody offered me

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.930
a job in a contemporary
art museum.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.692
I'm like, I don't
understand the rules.

00:04:09.692 --> 00:04:11.650
They're always saying
like, don't touch things.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.233
And then it's contemporary art
so they're like, why aren't you

00:04:14.233 --> 00:04:14.950
touching it?

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.660
Very confusing.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.950
And they wanted somebody, like
a rule-breaker from the outside

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.850
to come inside and
create wild programs

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.840
and generate new revenue streams
and increase attendance--

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.350
pretty regular metrics
for functioning, right?

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.960
And so, I got there
and I started--

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.200
I did what I do in theater,
that's my background.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.610
You sort of assess
the situation.

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.280
You're like, who's my audience,
what do I have to work with,

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.510
what are the props?

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.210
And I realized there
was this weird thing

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.490
I've never heard of called
Employee of the Month.

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.810
Anybody familiar with it?

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.860
I'm like, Employee of the Month?

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.600
That sounds fantastic.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.650
How do I win that?

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.430
And you're laughing-- again,
HR was like, Tania, you

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.860
don't win it, you earn it.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.147
And I was like, then I will
earn your vote and win it.

00:05:07.147 --> 00:05:08.230
And here's what happened--

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.890
I'll show you.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.630
So, the program I created was
called "Out of the Cubicle,"

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.400
because I was like--

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.540
they brought me into to
think outside the box,

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.790
they stuffed me in a cubicle--

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.590
ironic or scary,
it's a fine line.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:18.040
And I decided to create a
programmatic area online

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.610
where people could see that
those of us who thought museums

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.220
are kind of sterile and the
rules, I don't understand,

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.470
and am I OK to go in?

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:27.950
Will I fit in?

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.730
I created this program where
I ran around the offices

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.590
and actually got to
know my colleagues

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.650
and made these videos that
expose the fact that art

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:39.070
museums, just like any
other office culture,

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:41.740
are unique and
boring and exciting

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.340
and everything in between.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.180
And so, people started
watching this program--

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.270
they came in through the United
States, than other countries.

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.390
And so, I was doing
my job, essentially.

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:55.780
But here's the critique
that people had--

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.000
and this was a corporately
structured museum.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.770
There were probably
200 employees

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.930
and there were lots of rules.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:07.070
And I said, working and fun,
they're not mutually exclusive.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:11.090
And then I showed
them why they're not.

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.180
So, I did lunch
programs in the museum--

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.200
that was part of my job.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.940
I increased revenue streams.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.333
So, not only did people
come in through the videos,

00:07:19.333 --> 00:07:21.250
but they literally wanted
to come and see what

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:23.080
was happening in the museum.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.530
I also created a program
called Arm Wrestling for Art--

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:27.880
crazy.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.430
Where I used my teeny
tiny, nonprofit budget

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.550
to buy an arm wrestling table--
because that makes sense.

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:36.340
And then, we put it in
the middle of the museum--

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.610
because the problem I
was trying to solve was,

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:41.890
who here likes art?

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:44.800
Who here can afford to buy
the art that they really like?

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.090
All the hands go down.

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:48.220
And I thought, how
do we democratize

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.810
the acquiring of art?

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:52.210
How do we make art
accessible for everyone?

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:54.160
What do museums not do?

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.750
They don't give away art.

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:58.060
And so I thought, let's
make people sweat it out

00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.830
and arm wrestle
for a piece of art.

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:01.095
That seems fair.

00:08:01.095 --> 00:08:02.470
That's how we'd
solve the problem

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:06.530
as kids, that's how we're
going to do it as adults.

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:08.590
So, we increased
attendance numbers.

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:09.220
That's my job.

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:10.540
Brand awareness--
everybody started

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.400
to know about Scottsdale
Museum of Contemporary Art.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.140
It's a small
contemporary art museum,

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.120
but it had all of this
new life and people

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.430
coming through the doors
and through the videos.

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:22.720
Earned media, which anybody in
marketing knows, you pay a lot

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.970
and then you're like, oh
that didn't have an impact.

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.300
We didn't go viral.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.050
So, we just earn it
the old fashioned way.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:30.133
And then you drop the mic.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:38.620
So, once upon a time, I was
giving a talk at a startup

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:42.403
week, and these two engineers
from American Express

00:08:42.403 --> 00:08:43.570
came up to me after my talk.

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:45.610
They're all like, oh, my god,
that was so cool-- creativity,

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:46.310
blah blah blah.

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:48.310
And they're like, we want
to start an innovation

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:52.210
lab in our company, but we
have no buy-in from our boss,

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:55.480
no money, no space, and nobody
thinks it's a good idea.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.570
What's your solve, Tania?

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:00.100
Oh, my gosh.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.150
I'm like-- totally easy.

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:05.950
I'm going to introduce you to
an artist named Meg Dogood.

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:08.350
So, Meg lives in Chicago.

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:09.800
She had a dream.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.070
Her dream was to have four
walls, a gallery space.

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:13.570
That's it.

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:16.090
She wanted four walls to be
able to put people's artwork

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:17.540
in from around the world.

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:18.580
She had no money.

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:20.110
She was like a
full-time artist--

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:23.770
no patrons, no space, no buy-in,
no American Express card,

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:24.910
I'm certain.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:28.480
And here's what she did
to solve that problem--

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.220
she didn't have
the limiting belief

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:33.080
that the guys at
American Express had.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.570
So, she created Clutch Gallery.

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:39.340
It's a 25 square inch space
in the heart of her purse.

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:46.000
It's totally absurd
and wackily wonderful.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.007
And so, she solved a problem.

00:09:48.007 --> 00:09:49.840
And I'll show you one
of her installations--

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:50.715
it's a painting show.

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:57.910
And so, it just goes to
show you that had she

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:00.980
had the same limiting belief--
like I don't have money.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.380
I don't have space.

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:03.820
I don't have buy-in.

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:06.490
She never would have created
this innovative space.

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:09.670
And artists love the challenge
of trying to create artwork

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:11.690
for 25 by 25 square inches.

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:16.240
I know.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.400
OK.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.940
So, who here went
to first grade?

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:21.450
Great.

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:24.310
I knew we'd have
something in common.

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:25.530
So, I went to first grade.

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:27.983
I was five years old, which
was younger than the kids--

00:10:27.983 --> 00:10:30.150
not because I was real
smart, but because my parents

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:32.040
had sex at a certain
period of time

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.510
and I was born in September.

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:36.300
So there was no
like, she's so smart.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:39.300
So, I was younger than the
other kids and I was like--

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.030
I was super chubby, but it
was all focused in my belly.

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:44.930
So it was like I
had a gut, you know?

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:49.430
And I wore eyeglasses.

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:52.460
Anybody wear eyeglasses as a
four or five, six-year-old?

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:53.720
Fantastic.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.330
We thought we were really cool.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:58.700
My mom said, you're cute, Tania.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.620
I felt sophisticated
and more intellectual

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.460
than my counterparts.

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:04.100
I was ready to rock.

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:07.700
So, I get on the school bus for
the first day of first grade

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.490
and I'm like, I'm
looking good, what?

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:13.280
I've got my glasses, and
I'm just rock and roll.

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:14.920
Like oh.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.640
But, there didn't seem to
be any early adopters of me.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.050
That's fine.

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:24.170
And so, I get on the bus and I
see a girl who's about my age--

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:25.670
and the bus is
about to take off--

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:27.867
so I slide into one of
those pleather benches

00:11:27.867 --> 00:11:28.700
and sit next to her.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.920
And I'm like, let the day begin.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.590
And she looks me square
in the eye and I'm like--

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:35.890
I like this assertiveness.

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:40.160
And she's like, four eyes.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.290
I know.

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:45.260
So, every single day of
the first week of school

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:49.010
I get on the bus and I try
to avoid the child tyrant.

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:50.390
I'd find a seat over here.

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:54.410
And somehow, that little menace
managed to sneak in and call me

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:55.520
four eyes.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:01.380
And I was like sad and lonely
and didn't know what to do.

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:02.960
So, I consulted my mom.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:09.980
And my mom was like Tania,
four eyes are better than two.

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:14.430
And I'm like, not only does
that little girl suck at math,

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:16.840
but she sucks at life.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.655
And so I was like,
great, I'm armed

00:12:19.655 --> 00:12:22.220
and I'm ready to rock and roll.

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:25.550
And so I get on the bus
with my newfound phrase

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:28.310
and I sit next to
her on purpose.

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:30.680
And she's like, four
eyes, and I'm like,

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.290
four eyes are better than two.

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:37.200
And she said, no, they're not.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.970
And I said nothing.

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:41.220
I had no comeback at all.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.990
The good news is that I grew up.

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:44.592
And, oh, somebody--
I was talking

00:12:44.592 --> 00:12:46.800
about this story the other
day and somebody was like,

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.480
what happened to
this little girl?

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:52.885
And I'm like, well, you know she
didn't invent Google Glass, OK?

00:12:52.885 --> 00:12:54.510
She's not a co-founder
of Warby Parker.

00:12:57.150 --> 00:13:01.320
But what I've learned over
years of being in the world

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:06.550
is that little critic is not
only on the outside of us,

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:09.990
but a lot of times we have
that little child tyrant

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:11.850
on the inside of us.

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:16.770
And also what I've learned is
that when we see her or him

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:22.180
or non-gender binary person and
we acknowledge and we say, OK,

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.030
I see you, and we let go--

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:25.745
that's super helpful.

00:13:25.745 --> 00:13:27.120
And I learned
another thing too--

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:30.930
that nobody writes
books or plays

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:36.555
or makes software for or
about anybody who's perfect.

00:13:36.555 --> 00:13:38.430
You wouldn't want to
read a book if everybody

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:40.680
fit in and was perfect.

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:43.265
To be perfect or to fit
in is to be invisible.

00:13:43.265 --> 00:13:44.890
And I just didn't
want to be invisible.

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:46.973
So, that was a really good
moment for me to learn.

00:13:46.973 --> 00:13:48.540
That's me.

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:51.090
Stop it right now.

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:52.240
Is my mom here?

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:57.718
And, clearly, I was going to
audition for the Village People

00:13:57.718 --> 00:13:58.260
the next day.

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.220
Oh, my gosh.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:04.100
OK.

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:07.220
So, at some point
in my career, I

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:10.910
received a phone call from a
software company named AxoSoft.

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:13.928
And they were like, Tania,
we've seen you performing

00:14:13.928 --> 00:14:15.470
and presenting around
town, we'd like

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:17.300
to talk to you about software.

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:19.100
And I'm like software?

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:20.810
That sounds awesome.

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:23.930
I don't know what
they're talking about.

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:26.690
I love cashmere.

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:30.930
And so, I took a leap of faith.

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:31.453
I really do.

00:14:31.453 --> 00:14:33.620
But I can't afford it, so
I go to second-hand stores

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:34.190
and purchase it.

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:34.690
Thank you.

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:39.920
So, I took a leap of
faith and I decided

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.150
to meet with this
software company.

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:45.800
And I met with the CEO at
the time, Lawdan Shojaee.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.592
She's like, we really
like your energy.

00:14:47.592 --> 00:14:48.800
That's why we brought you in.

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.440
And I'm like, I like your
energy, that's why I came in.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.315
She's like, but we're
not offering you a job.

00:14:53.315 --> 00:14:54.660
And I'm like, OK, why am I here?

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:55.862
I don't understand.

00:14:55.862 --> 00:14:57.320
And she's like,
we've always wanted

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.420
to have a brand evangelist.

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:02.210
You would make a
great evangelist.

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:05.470
And I was like,
that would totally

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:07.510
freak my Jewish mom out.

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:08.320
Yeah.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.097
I want to be an evangelist.

00:15:10.097 --> 00:15:10.930
Can I get a witness?

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:19.600
And so, I started work at
this company, and my first day

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:23.960
on the job I was like, what
is this magical software we're

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:24.460
selling?

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.770
Is it like a tool
for telling stories?

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:29.350
Is it a magical
paintbrush that allows

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:31.300
artists to make work on wall?

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:32.020
What is it?

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:36.580
And she was like, oh, it's a
B2B project management software

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:38.050
for software developers.

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:41.750
And I was like trapped
in slow motion,

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:44.620
like, what are you saying?

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:48.500
I don't understand that.

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:52.540
And soon, I learned I didn't
understand a lot of stuff.

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:55.570
You know, I would hear
people talking about AI

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:59.320
and I was like, oh, that's when
a British person is at a pub

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.490
and they ask for more beer.

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:03.400
They're like, I would
like another point.

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.500
That's not the case.

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.600
I also heard people
talking about-- they

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.850
were like, open source,
open source, open source--

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:12.430
and I'm like, don't
kiss that person.

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:17.830
I'm pretty sure that
that's no bueno.

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:19.640
So, I had a lot
of learning to do.

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.430
And, unfortunately--
and fortunately--

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:23.680
within the first two months
of being there and knowing

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.620
absolutely very
little about software,

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:29.320
my boss came to a
colleague and I and said,

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:32.320
we are going to host a
girls in technology event.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.840
It's an inaugural one, and I
want to show up in a big way,

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.870
so come up with a big idea
around women in technology.

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:41.710
This is April 2015 just
to give some context

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:47.020
So, my colleague and I
Sara, we're brainstorming.

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:49.060
Came up with nothing.

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:52.300
Then I went for a
little walk and I

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:55.120
started thinking about
women in the tech space

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:57.400
and women in lots
of spaces and how,

00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.730
a lot of times, we're not
seen, heard, or celebrated

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:02.350
for the superheroes we are.

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:05.230
And so, I came up
with this symbol--

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:07.819
I didn't come up with her, she's
been around for a long time.

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:09.708
The bathroom lady-- she's here.

00:17:09.708 --> 00:17:10.750
She's made an appearance.

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:11.920
I've seen her twice today.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:14.349
Thank you.

00:17:14.349 --> 00:17:17.619
And I knew that this
symbol was immediately

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:20.839
recognizable across
cultures, across genders.

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:22.720
And I didn't know anything else.

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:23.770
I just had like--

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:26.140
it wasn't even an idea,
it was just a symbol.

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:30.610
And I brought the symbol back
to my colleague and I'm like,

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:31.510
here she is.

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:33.550
And my colleague's like, OK.

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:35.150
And that was sort of that.

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:36.650
But I couldn't shake
the fact that--

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:38.800
see the shape of her dress?

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:40.360
It's a triangle.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:43.900
And I thought, gosh,
yeah, it's a dress,

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:47.890
and it looks kind of
like the shape of a cape.

00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:51.260
And so I printed out the
vector and made a few lines

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:54.150
and then I'm like,
see it right there.

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:58.035
And AxoSoft-- we came
up with the campaign--

00:17:58.035 --> 00:17:58.910
It Was Never a Dress.

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:01.077
And I will show you what
happened with it, because I

00:18:01.077 --> 00:18:03.900
think it's important to play.

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:06.840
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.320
- When Tania and Sara came
to me and they gave me

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:16.560
their pitch on this
idea, I immediately

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.470
saw it and I thought, wow,
yes, I completely agree.

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:20.460
This was big.

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:24.000
- Initially, I thought of
a symbol that was easily

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.480
recognizable, and I thought
of the bathroom lady,

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:30.120
because she's everywhere--
just everywhere in the world.

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.920
That lady gets around.

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:36.480
So, I printed out an image of
the symbol, and I took a pencil

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.060
and started drawing some lines.

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:41.700
And, very quickly,
she had a cape on,

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.980
and she was fully present.

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:46.210
And it was as if she'd
been there this whole time

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:49.505
and I just hadn't seen her.

00:18:49.505 --> 00:18:51.050
- We were at the conference.

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:52.300
So, we were pretty busy.

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:53.680
We were on social media.

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:57.700
We saw the first tweet and we
were like, wow, this is great.

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:00.700
Someone is really
connecting with the image.

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:03.370
And then "Huffington
Post" retweeted it.

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:05.785
That was kind of the
beginning of it going viral.

00:19:05.785 --> 00:19:10.690
- And then, bam, in 24 American
hours, It just blew up.

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:15.070
I think people were very excited
to see that they weren't just

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:17.680
a symbol of the mundane,
but they're actually

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.470
a symbol of the extraordinary.

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:22.400
- We're trying to create
a community and a forum.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.250
So, a woman was
telling us about how

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:27.247
she had shown that image to
her young son and daughter,

00:19:27.247 --> 00:19:29.080
and then later they had
gone to the restroom

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:31.413
and the kids were excited and
they said, hey, mom, we're

00:19:31.413 --> 00:19:33.370
going into the
superheroes bathroom.

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:36.740
I thought, that's how we measure
success is the next generation,

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:38.773
now they are seeing
things differently

00:19:38.773 --> 00:19:40.440
and their perceptions
have been shifted.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.640
- We started having an
overwhelming request

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:43.720
for merchandise.

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:45.397
However, we didn't
want to commoditize

00:19:45.397 --> 00:19:47.230
the conversations that
were taking place on,

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:48.620
It Was Never a Dress.

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:52.270
So we thought, let's start a
Steam scholarship with ASU,

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:54.100
and we plan on fueling
that scholarship

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:55.730
with the merchandise.

00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:58.510
Tania was brought into
AxoSoft as an evangelist,

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:00.970
and part of the things
that she's phenomenal with

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:02.230
is public speaking.

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:05.680
It's only natural for her to be
popping up maybe in your city

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.680
soon where she will be
speaking on this campaign

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.080
and helping keep
the movement going.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:14.347
- It Was Never a Dress
campaign is really a story,

00:20:14.347 --> 00:20:16.180
and it's also a proposition
for other people

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:17.260
to share their stories.

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:19.390
So, yes, I will be
going out into the world

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:22.480
and speaking publicly
about It Was Never a Dress.

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:24.580
You can invite me
to your hometown.

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:26.860
There's no crowd that's
too small or too large.

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:29.110
Because if we see
women differently,

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:31.180
we see the world differently.

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:34.330
If we see women differently,
we see the world differently.

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:38.142
If we see women differently,
we see the world differently.

00:20:38.142 --> 00:20:39.610
[INAUDIBLE]

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:41.586
[CHEERING]

00:20:41.586 --> 00:20:46.014
[CHANTING]

00:20:51.426 --> 00:20:54.377
[END PLAYBACK]

00:20:54.377 --> 00:20:55.960
TANIA KATAN: One
thing that was really

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:59.930
astounding about this moment
in terms of my work life

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:02.830
and my creative life
merging was my job--

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:04.570
I was embedded in marketing.

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:05.680
I was an evangelist.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.710
My job was to learn the product
and to go out into the world

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:12.860
and preach the good word of B2B
project management software.

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:14.290
The end.

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:19.450
And, being presented
with this challenge,

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:22.240
solve a problem that you
really know very little about.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:25.690
You've been a woman in
technology for two months,

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:27.100
do something.

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:29.320
And I really saw that
as an opportunity

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:33.700
to use some of the skills that
I had developed as a playwright

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:37.330
in theater school to see and
engage an audience with text,

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:38.350
with a story.

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:40.540
And I went above
and beyond my job,

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:43.400
because it was something
that was important to do.

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:46.240
And even though I no
longer work for AxoSoft,

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:50.650
we created this beautiful thing
that's bigger than all of us

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:51.340
together.

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:53.860
And something that I write
about in "Creative Trespassing"

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:56.770
that a lot of people forget
is that we have an opportunity

00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:59.890
to leave a creative
legacy at our work.

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:01.630
We can leave people
and processes

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:03.617
in better shape than
when we arrived there.

00:22:03.617 --> 00:22:05.200
It took me a long
time to learn that--

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.600
I mean, I definitely had
some jobs where I'm like,

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:11.090
you refill your own paper.

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:13.720
I was out.

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:17.860
Ink cartridge-- my
pie hole, you know?

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:19.230
And then I left.

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:23.430
And so, I'm really proud
of myself that I left.

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:25.810
And I think that that's
really important,

00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:29.770
because as we sort
of conflate or we

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:32.350
remove the space
between work and life,

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:35.800
between fun and work,
that we actually

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:39.400
have all of these
opportunities to create.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:42.400
So, I would like to do
something right now.

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:46.930
I feel like we started at
the ending, so let's end

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:48.730
at the beginning, right?

00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:52.170
And, after this, I would love
to have a little Q&amp;A slash

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:53.860
conversation.

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:57.170
That's Italian for conversation.

00:22:57.170 --> 00:23:00.605
So, we're just going to take
a moment to close our eyes,

00:23:00.605 --> 00:23:02.980
and I'm going to lead you
through a very short mind's eye

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:03.502
journey.

00:23:03.502 --> 00:23:05.710
If you've not done a mind's
eye journey, all it means

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:08.570
is that I will gently guide
you, and you just receive.

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:09.070
That's it.

00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:17.890
So, I want you to imagine one
of your self-limiting beliefs.

00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:20.560
And, by that, I mean
a belief that you

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:27.100
hold that stops you from having
and experiencing more joy, more

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:31.470
creativity, and
pursuing your dreams.

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:38.160
So, it could be anything from,
I don't deserve a raise to,

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:42.950
I can't call myself an artist,
or I don't belong here.

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:53.780
So, see this
self-limiting belief.

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:56.930
I want you to gently let it go.

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:14.190
And when you feel like
you've let it go--

00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:16.240
and this is a longer
process than just now--

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:18.310
but when you've
let it go for now,

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:19.660
I want you to open your eyes.

00:24:38.012 --> 00:24:40.520
OK.

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:43.960
And now that you've
let something go,

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.133
there's room to take a leap.

00:24:45.133 --> 00:24:46.300
So, we're going to stand up.

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:57.910
And this isn't a big,
performative gesture.

00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:00.640
The most important part
about taking a leap

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:02.450
is that we're doing it together.

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:05.570
And so, it's-- bend your
knees just a little bit,

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:06.370
just slightly.

00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:08.660
And, again, it's
not about jumping

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:10.900
highest, it's just about--

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:14.440
we didn't sign any waivers.

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:16.720
This is a gentle jump.

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:19.400
Again, the most important part
is that we do it together.

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:21.560
So, I'm going to count--
on the count of three,

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:25.050
we're going to gently take
a leap of faith together.

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:30.400
OK-- one, two, three.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:31.840
Awesome.

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:33.280
Thank you so much.

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:34.408
I appreciate it.

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:46.350
And also, here's something I--

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:50.040
I've worked really
hard and focused

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:54.300
to feel comfortable in front
of human beings and presenting.

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:57.180
And even I get
nervous sometimes--

00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:00.610
and I'm guessing that all
of us get nervous sometimes.

00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:02.760
And you can remember
the beginning

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:06.780
if you need a standing ovation
from all of us and you.

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:08.670
And you can also
remember that when you're

00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:10.328
leaping into the unknown--

00:26:10.328 --> 00:26:12.120
when you're starting
a new job, when you're

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:15.150
tackling a new project, when
you're sharing your ideas,

00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:17.730
that we're all leaping with you.

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:20.520
I think that's helpful to know.

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:24.310
I would love to engage in a
little questions and answers.

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:26.980
And, if you have no questions,
I'll ask you questions,

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:29.840
but I don't think you're
going to want that.

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:30.340
I'm kidding.

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:31.380
I'm kidding.

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:32.906
I'm totally kidding.

00:26:32.906 --> 00:26:36.858
AUDIENCE: Oh, I was like,
oh, you're very intuitive.

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:41.240
How do you write a book?

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:44.020
TANIA KATAN: How do
you write a book?

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:45.900
This is actually something
that I write about

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.310
in "Creative Trespassing"--
whether you're

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:49.410
wanting to write a book
or make a career shift

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:52.440
or actually try on a
different role, you start.

00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:03.870
And so, you write a
few lines about what

00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:05.490
you think the book is about.

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:07.290
Maybe you write a
few lines about what

00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:09.240
you want your next
job to look like

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:12.120
or what you want your
next project to look like.

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:15.000
And then you leave it
for a day, and then you

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.260
come back a day later.

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:18.900
And then you don't look at
it and you write some more.

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:21.240
So, this is how I've
written this book,

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:24.210
and this is how a lot of
authors that I know write

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:27.488
is they write a little a lot.

00:27:27.488 --> 00:27:28.530
You know what I'm saying?

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:33.240
And if you're thinking about
or you already have a practice

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:36.420
of writing in a journal or
writing a book or whatever,

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:39.660
a lot of times we have this
self-limiting belief that we

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:42.420
put ourselves on a schedule
and if we do not adhere to that

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:44.490
schedule, we will just stop--

00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:46.320
game over.

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:49.350
And I would suggest
to you that you--

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:52.140
even if you mess up
your own schedule

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:54.000
that only you gave you--

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.960
that you forgive
yourself and continue on.

00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.370
So, do a little a lot.

00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:02.550
And also, I find that
accountability-- for me,

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:07.162
personally, I like to have my
personal board of directors

00:28:07.162 --> 00:28:09.120
that I'm like, you guys,
here's what I'm doing.

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.490
I will send you
some pages, I don't

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:12.990
need you to read
them, I just you

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:14.430
need to know they're coming.

00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:16.597
Or I need you to read them
and I need some feedback,

00:28:16.597 --> 00:28:17.940
I need to beta test these ideas.

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:21.090
Very keen of beta testing
lives and projects--

00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:22.800
love it.

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:24.810
So, yeah.

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:26.630
That's a little a lot.

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:28.180
Yeah, thanks, Kate.

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:29.837
AUDIENCE: I was
curious about when

00:28:29.837 --> 00:28:31.920
you were saying you were
getting criticism around,

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:33.628
oh, she's just running
around having fun.

00:28:33.628 --> 00:28:36.840
And how you felt about that
whether you were just like--

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.825
blew it off because you have
all those checked boxes of I'm

00:28:39.825 --> 00:28:43.407
so great, or did
that feel bad to you?

00:28:43.407 --> 00:28:44.490
I'm curious what you felt.

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:46.050
TANIA KATAN: That's
a great question.

00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:47.650
All of the above.

00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:49.950
And I remember, actually,
when that news was delivered.

00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:54.990
We were in an all-hands meeting
for just the museum staff.

00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:57.300
And there were like
20 of us there,

00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:59.460
and my boss sort of
delivered the news--

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:01.830
like there are people who
are really concerned who

00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:04.260
find you problematic.

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:07.080
And he's like, and I want
you to know, I got your back.

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:09.510
And then I made a
realization-- because it hurt.

00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:11.550
I mean, we're human
beings, right?

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:13.710
When somebody says,
hey, all the effort

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:18.900
that you're putting into
making this organization better

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:20.380
is not right.

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:21.930
You're not doing
it the right way.

00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:23.190
I felt hurt.

00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:25.287
I felt like, oh,
my gosh, this is

00:29:25.287 --> 00:29:27.662
the only way I know how to
contribute and blah blah blah.

00:29:27.662 --> 00:29:29.640
It was great that
my boss had my back.

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:34.230
And I also learned something
that was freaky and unexpected

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:36.180
which was that joy
is actually really

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:38.820
confrontational to people
who are not choosing

00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:41.070
to live within a state of joy.

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:44.040
And that was both disheartening
and really powerful

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:46.140
information.

00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:49.230
So, that's why I sort of
preach the good word of joy,

00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:51.300
because it is a mindset
and it's something

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:55.920
we can choose, even in rigid,
rule-bound environments.

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:58.980
It's really the only
thing that we have.

00:29:58.980 --> 00:29:59.480
Thank you.

00:30:04.716 --> 00:30:07.780
AUDIENCE: So, how do you
deal with the perception,

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:11.080
if you've received this, that
when you switch projects,

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:13.030
that people might
think that you're

00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:17.317
unreliable or
flighty or unfocused?

00:30:17.317 --> 00:30:18.400
How do you deal with that?

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.830
TANIA KATAN: I wrote an
entire book all about that.

00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:22.810
I'm being totally sincere.

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:27.580
So, for years people would
say, so what do you do?

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:31.840
And I was like, I am a curator
of everything-- whatever.

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:38.020
I just made stuff up until I
realized that if I assessed

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:43.150
my skills, my superpowers and
understood what those were,

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:45.730
then it opened up
everything-- that I could

00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:47.830
go into any field, any job.

00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:50.080
So, the clarity
comes in knowing what

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.000
you're bringing,
because you bring that

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.470
to whatever situation.

00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:55.330
You bring that to
the supermarket.

00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:57.310
You bring that to
your family parties.

00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:59.300
You bring that to work.

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:01.960
So, the sooner I
understood what I brought,

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:05.160
the easier it was for me to
leap into different forms.

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:08.620
And that's something-- we
obviously live in a system

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:12.050
and a society
that's very siloed--

00:31:12.050 --> 00:31:14.740
and we have business
cards to prove that.

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:17.680
You are a developer, you are--

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:21.100
and I remember, I
was at a conference--

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:23.680
I was speaking to 500 CIOs.

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:24.880
Any CIOs here?

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:25.450
Great.

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:28.240
Let the jokes rip.

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:32.680
So, I was in the
back of the room,

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:37.300
and there were 500 CIOs
all dressed in suits--

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:40.840
varying colors from
dark blue to black.

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:43.630
And it was a Saturday, so they
didn't have to wear suits.

00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:45.460
So you know they were like this.

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:49.075
And I was in the back watching
the speaker before me,

00:31:49.075 --> 00:31:50.950
and I was freaking out
because he was talking

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:53.500
about like AI and IA and VR.

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:57.640
And I'm like, unless they
want a monologue about TMI

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:02.830
or UTI or BMWs, I had nothing.

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:04.180
I was totally scared.

00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:07.990
And, to make matters
worse, he's killing it.

00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:10.240
And the CIOs are going wild.

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:17.150
They're like-- and I'm
like, ah, where's the exit?

00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:19.760
And then the MC
grabs the microphone

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:22.310
and he's like, oh,
let's thank Steve.

00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:26.000
And then we'd like to welcome
to the stage, Tania Katan,

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.800
she is a CIO.

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:32.540
And I'm like, oh, hell
no, I'm not a CIO.

00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:33.800
Another self-limiting belief.

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:36.630
And I'm not a CIO.

00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:38.630
And then he grabs the
mic and he's like--

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:40.880
chief inspiration officer.

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:44.240
And I was like, oh, my god.

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.895
So, what I learned from that--

00:32:45.895 --> 00:32:47.270
what I learned
from that moment--

00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:50.060
and I write about it because
it was so impactful--

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:53.840
is that I thought when people
ask you what do you do,

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:56.000
that it meant, what's
your job title?

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.900
But, in that moment, I
realized, oh, it's my purpose.

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:01.580
That's what I do.

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:06.042
And the more certain and
comfortable you are with that,

00:33:06.042 --> 00:33:07.250
the more you can bring it in.

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:08.875
And when somebody
says, what do you do?

00:33:08.875 --> 00:33:11.000
You can make up a job title.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.400
You can tell them, here's
my purpose, or sit down,

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:16.420
I'm not going to give
you an elevator pitch.

00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:17.960
If you really want
to know, let me

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:19.620
share what I do in the world.

00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:21.260
So, great question, thank you.

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:23.990
AUDIENCE: So, for people who may
not consider themselves super

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:27.440
creative, are there
tools or strategies

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:30.710
that you advise to maybe
tap into creativity?

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:33.800
You mentioned with
your campaign,

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:37.160
you figured that out on a
walk or some kind of strategy

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:40.040
where maybe we step away
from our day to day,

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:42.760
not so creative work to
tap into the creative.

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:43.760
TANIA KATAN: Absolutely.

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:44.760
That's a great question.

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:46.302
So, first of all,
I would like to say

00:33:46.302 --> 00:33:49.620
that creativity is defined as,
really, using your imagination.

00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:51.860
It's not about making art
or painting or duh duh duh.

00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:52.640
You could do that.

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:54.650
But creativity is about
using your imagination.

00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:57.560
So, one thing that I recommend
in "Creative Trespassing"

00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:59.940
is to ditch school.

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:01.400
Anybody ditch school as a kid?

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:02.560
Yeah.

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:04.100
We learned all
the skills we need

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:05.990
to disrupt our patterns
and habits that

00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:07.650
are keeping us stuck.

00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:10.798
So, what I recommend is that
you get up from your desk--

00:34:10.798 --> 00:34:12.590
you don't have anything
to prove by working

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:15.929
until you're sweating and you're
regretting the job you took--

00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:16.429
OK?

00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:17.360
Nothing to prove.

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:20.420
Get up, take a five-minute,
10-minute walk.

00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:24.830
Stanford did a study on walking
and the impact of creativity.

00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:27.510
And it raises your
creativity by 60%.

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:29.179
So, when you find
yourself trapped

00:34:29.179 --> 00:34:34.010
in trying to solve a problem
or just stuck in a routine,

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:36.440
get up and go for a walk.

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:39.139
And, in fact, there's something
called the Museum of Walking

00:34:39.139 --> 00:34:41.920
that I'm a board member of.

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:42.753
And it's true.

00:34:42.753 --> 00:34:43.670
And you'll look it up.

00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:45.590
And, basically,
the museum exists

00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:49.670
outside of the wall-- there
are no walls to the museum.

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:51.020
What?

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:54.199
Why don't you Google that later.

00:34:54.199 --> 00:34:54.739
Oh, my god.

00:34:54.739 --> 00:34:56.659
I was trying to weave that in.

00:34:56.659 --> 00:34:58.010
Anyway.

00:34:58.010 --> 00:35:01.310
And then throughout the
book, I have these things

00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:03.350
called productive
disruptions, and they're

00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:08.150
exercises because I know that
when we disrupt these holding

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:10.700
patterns, we
actually do more work

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:13.580
and have more joy in
that state of creating--

00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:15.020
or co-creating work.

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:16.115
Yeah, thank you.

00:35:16.115 --> 00:35:17.690
AUDIENCE: This
work is incredible,

00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:19.853
and you are a
phenomenal speaker.

00:35:19.853 --> 00:35:21.770
I'm sure you wake up
every morning with ideas,

00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:23.942
but what's next for you?

00:35:23.942 --> 00:35:25.900
You've written a book,
you're a public speaker.

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:29.060
TANIA KATAN: Oh, my gosh.

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:31.310
Gosh, this is where
I think my meditation

00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:33.080
practice has messed me up.

00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:35.150
What's next is what's now.

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:37.760
I don't know what else
to say about that.

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:41.780
What's next is me
continuing to speak.

00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:46.400
So, a lot of companies bring
me in to give talks and teach

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:50.540
workshops on how do we use
creative skills for, maybe,

00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:53.630
theater or contemporary
art to innovate

00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:54.920
from within our companies.

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:56.615
I would like to be
doing more and more--

00:35:56.615 --> 00:35:58.110
I could do that all day.

00:35:58.110 --> 00:36:00.200
And I think a lot of
people ask, well, you

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:01.742
come from performance,
don't you want

00:36:01.742 --> 00:36:02.930
to perform again on a stage?

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:05.150
And, to me, the
most impactful work

00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:07.555
is being an outsider
on the inside.

00:36:07.555 --> 00:36:09.680
And then you quickly realize
when you're like, hey,

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.310
you guys, I do wild things.

00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:12.470
And they're like, I do too.

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:14.720
Oh, my god, there are creative
trespassers everywhere.

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:18.050
And, so, really, the end game
with "Creative Trespassing"

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:22.040
is to cause a creative
revolution inside our bodies,

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:23.880
our minds, and our cubicles.

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:24.380
That's all.

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:28.300
Thank you.

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:28.800
Yeah.

00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:32.638
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:32.638 --> 00:36:34.430
With the theme of
International Women's Day

00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:36.860
being "Balance for Better,"
can you talk about what balance

00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:37.443
means for you?

00:36:37.443 --> 00:36:38.720
TANIA KATAN: Oh.

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:41.200
Sleeping eight hours.

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:41.820
You know what?

00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:45.470
So, as in my introduction,
you learned I actually

00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:49.310
have gone through cancer two
times-- one when I was 21,

00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:51.520
one was when I was 31 years old.

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:54.200
And when you've
endured an illness,

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:56.360
or if you're living
with an illness,

00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:00.680
you are painfully aware
of the body and the mind

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:02.210
and the connection
or the moments

00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:04.790
when one wants to
disconnect, because it's

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:06.890
painful and uncomfortable.

00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:10.040
And, after enduring those
two bouts of cancer,

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:13.500
I realized I needed to
take care of myself.

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:15.450
So, even though I'm
sort of on book tour

00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:19.650
and I'm going back and back,
how I care for myself is I

00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:21.540
eat well.

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:25.170
And I'm open to dinners
being paid for by anyone.

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:27.160
Then I eat better.

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:28.890
I eat well.

00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:31.630
I try to walk every day.

00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:34.770
And I say, try, because
sometimes I'm limited in time.

00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:36.570
But even then, I
literally will walk around

00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:38.310
like a hotel parking lot.

00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:41.700
My body feels better
when it's walked.

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:46.170
And also I meditate and
that makes me really--

00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:48.600
that makes me consider
what's in front of me

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:50.310
rather than what's ahead of me.

00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:51.810
And I think that's
really important,

00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:54.310
because if I'm not occupying
this space right here and right

00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:56.640
now, I actually don't know
what's going to be next.

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:59.160
I won't be open to what's
next and I want to be open.

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:00.690
So, yeah, that's it.

00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:01.620
Great question.

00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:02.475
Thank you.

00:38:02.475 --> 00:38:04.570
AUDIENCE: First of
all, great talk.

00:38:04.570 --> 00:38:07.800
Thank you so much for
sharing your story with us.

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:10.950
I do feel like you have
the answers for everything.

00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:15.780
But I wanted to know, did you
ever experience self-doubt

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:17.010
in each of your journeys?

00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:19.565
And, if yes, how
did you combat that?

00:38:19.565 --> 00:38:21.210
TANIA KATAN: Oh, yes.

00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:21.878
All the time.

00:38:21.878 --> 00:38:22.920
And, in fact, what just--

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:25.320
I'll go with the first thing
that popped into my head.

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:28.795
When I started my job
at the museum, I mean,

00:38:28.795 --> 00:38:30.420
I don't have an art
history background,

00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:31.710
I've never been a curator.

00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:35.110
Like, I was the weirdest
choice for that job.

00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:38.410
And so, I was freaking
out the day before

00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:41.320
and I combated it by
saying, what do I wear?

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:43.170
How do I look arty?

00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:44.970
How do I look like
I work in a museum?

00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:47.820
Because my big,
self-limiting belief

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:52.050
since I was little until
now was, I don't fit in.

00:38:52.050 --> 00:38:53.490
I don't belong here.

00:38:53.490 --> 00:38:55.630
That has been a
refrain in the past.

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:57.400
So, I'm aware of that.

00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:59.370
And so, what I do
is the same thing

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:01.140
I've learned in theater school--

00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:04.750
you have to see an audience, you
have to listen to an audience,

00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:07.677
you have to decide what you're
going to give to an audience.

00:39:07.677 --> 00:39:09.510
And I don't mean this
in a performative way,

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:11.010
I mean this is like
an interpersonal way.

00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:12.690
So I'm like, OK, they're
a contemporary art--

00:39:12.690 --> 00:39:14.970
so I just sort of assessed
the situation and thought,

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:20.460
I will wear a blue shirt
and an orange blazer

00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:24.540
and red glasses and
some funky sneakers.

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:26.970
Yes, I looked like
a cartoon character,

00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:32.070
but it made me feel like I was
embodying the spirit of art.

00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:34.560
So, that's what I do.

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:37.890
And, also, I was
recently telling

00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:42.300
a story for "The Moth" in
front of 2,000 human beings.

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:44.880
And I hadn't done a
storytelling in that form,

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.140
and I was scared--

00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:47.070
super scared.

00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:48.930
So, here's what I did
in that situation.

00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:51.240
I'm about to go on,
and I say to myself--

00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:53.670
Tania, if you pass out,
you don't have to go on.

00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:59.040
"Creative Trespassing."

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:02.420
And so, this is something I've
learned from one of my teachers

00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:05.400
and from reading
and watching her--

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:09.175
Pema Chodron-- is that when
you are experiencing fear,

00:40:09.175 --> 00:40:10.800
it's sort of the last
thing on our list

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:13.890
to do to like embrace it.

00:40:13.890 --> 00:40:16.000
And she's like, go into it.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.820
Barrel headfirst into fear.

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:20.662
And then you realize,
oh, it's not so bad.

00:40:20.662 --> 00:40:21.870
I came out on the other side.

00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:23.412
We always come out
on the other side.

00:40:23.412 --> 00:40:26.010
You know that, and that's why
the leap of faith is important.

00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:28.050
The middle part,
you're like, ah.

00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:30.600
But you always know that
you're going to land, right?

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:32.950
And that it's going
to be more than OK.

00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:36.738
So, that's what I do.

00:40:36.738 --> 00:40:37.567
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:40:37.567 --> 00:40:39.900
So, it's really cool to hear
about how confident you are

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:42.950
and your purpose and what
you bring to the table.

00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:45.450
And you've talked about
how it's important to be

00:40:45.450 --> 00:40:46.260
grounded in that.

00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:48.070
How do you get to
that point, though?

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:49.470
If you could talk to that.

00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:51.387
TANIA KATAN: Yeah, that's
an awesome question.

00:40:51.387 --> 00:40:54.930
So, first of all, the way in
which we write books, the way

00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:56.070
in which we live lives--

00:40:56.070 --> 00:40:58.260
all of it is a practice.

00:40:58.260 --> 00:40:59.535
I approach it as a practice.

00:40:59.535 --> 00:41:00.410
I'm not the only one.

00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:03.180
There's a practice of
meditation-- doctors practice

00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:05.440
medicine.

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:08.610
Those who play
instruments practice.

00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:11.850
So, when we think about
it as a practice--

00:41:11.850 --> 00:41:14.190
and if it's a
practice, guess what?

00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:15.990
It's never going to
be perfect, right?

00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:17.170
It's a practice.

00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:20.640
So, if we think of
building skills around,

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:22.050
I want to be more
curious, I want

00:41:22.050 --> 00:41:23.970
to be more confident--
as practicing,

00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:26.220
I'm going to try on what
confident looks like or feels

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:27.400
like to me today.

00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:29.490
OK, that didn't work.

00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:31.590
That's OK, but one
moment within that,

00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:33.120
I did feel a little confident.

00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:35.412
Then you remember-- then you
try it again the next day,

00:41:35.412 --> 00:41:36.328
and then the next day.

00:41:36.328 --> 00:41:38.700
And then what happens is
something I learned in theater

00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:40.200
which is muscle memory--

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:40.860
guess what?

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:42.840
Your body knows what to do.

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:46.830
It shows up without your
mind messing things up.

00:41:46.830 --> 00:41:48.900
So, you have to
practice embodying

00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:52.440
what it is you
want to be and how

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:57.020
you want to be in the world
every day a little bit.

00:41:57.020 --> 00:42:00.680
Is that helpful?

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:05.066
I think we're going to
take two more questions.

00:42:05.066 --> 00:42:07.690
AUDIENCE: How did you
come to find your purpose?

00:42:07.690 --> 00:42:09.190
And what tools did
you use and which

00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:11.760
ones did you like most of all?

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:15.010
TANIA KATAN: So, I've written
about this, because it's

00:42:15.010 --> 00:42:17.830
taken me lots of tools.

00:42:17.830 --> 00:42:22.570
And, in "Creative Trespassing,"
an exercise that I have is

00:42:22.570 --> 00:42:24.220
it's called, write
your fight song.

00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:26.020
But, really, it's a manifesto.

00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:27.910
Who here knows what
a manifesto is?

00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:32.290
Yeah, it's a powerful
declaration of your purpose--

00:42:32.290 --> 00:42:34.660
of your why and your how.

00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:37.890
Like, yes, I declare
this, and here's

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:39.890
how I'm going to actually
do something about it.

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:42.700
So, it's not
passive, it's active.

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:44.170
And so, I've found my--

00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:47.300
I say, purpi, because I don't
think we have one purpose.

00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:50.750
And I think that this is also
one of those system silo traps

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:51.850
we find ourselves in.

00:42:51.850 --> 00:42:53.710
And I've definitely
found myself in it.

00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:56.350
I majored in theater, how come
I can't get a job in theater?

00:42:56.350 --> 00:42:58.420
I have no purpose--

00:42:58.420 --> 00:42:59.370
and scene.

00:42:59.370 --> 00:43:03.400
I'm using my degree.

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:06.670
And I've often found
myself in that trap,

00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:10.590
and then I realize, oh,
wait, my purpose is--

00:43:10.590 --> 00:43:14.230
and another indicator is,
what really enlivens you when

00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:16.840
you're in the act of doing it?

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:20.080
So, if you are coding and
you're like, holy shit,

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:22.870
this is so awesome, this
feels good and every fiber--

00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:26.440
or you're a problem
solver, you're a presenter

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:28.040
and you're like, I like people.

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.780
I like when they ask questions.

00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:31.970
Those are all indicators
of your purpose.

00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:37.030
So, I guess, buy the
book and do the exercise?

00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:41.770
And also-- and also, just
know that you monitor--

00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:45.640
you're the conductor of
the experiment of you,

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:47.710
and so you can be
aware of situations

00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:50.530
where you feel like this
makes me feel alive,

00:43:50.530 --> 00:43:52.780
and it enlivens those around me.

00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:55.630
Maybe this is one
of my purposes.

00:43:55.630 --> 00:43:56.410
Great question.

00:43:56.410 --> 00:43:57.178
Thank you.

00:43:57.178 --> 00:43:59.470
OK, we had a super quick--
we had a creative trespasser

00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:00.130
question.

00:44:00.130 --> 00:44:03.130
Didn't need a
microphone-- love that.

00:44:03.130 --> 00:44:05.710
How often do I burst into song?

00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:08.260
Like in my daily life?

00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:12.730
Oh, well, I am known far and
wide as the monotone wonder.

00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:14.980
So, I don't typically--

00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:18.810
but I burst into song always
when I'm on a road trip

00:44:18.810 --> 00:44:21.070
by myself.

00:44:21.070 --> 00:44:22.062
And I'm like, oh-ahh--

00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:28.300
because I hit all
the right notes when

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:31.090
it's just an audience of me.

00:44:31.090 --> 00:44:33.170
But I dance all the time.

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:36.610
So like in supermarkets
and conferences and things

00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:39.160
like that-- just,
inadvertently even sometimes.

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:40.780
I'm like what?

00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:42.430
That's awesome.

00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:44.824
Thanks for asking.

00:44:44.824 --> 00:44:46.620
AUDIENCE: I was
totally rooting for you

00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:47.980
with your Employee
of the Month video.

00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:49.180
And I was curious
if you actually

00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:50.263
won Employee of the Month.

00:44:50.263 --> 00:44:51.830
TANIA KATAN: Beautiful, Yeah.

00:44:51.830 --> 00:44:57.610
OK, so, again, my intention
with doing these videos

00:44:57.610 --> 00:44:59.470
was to actually get
to know my colleagues,

00:44:59.470 --> 00:45:02.320
engage them in a playful
manner, and check things

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:04.750
off the boxes of my job.

00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:06.520
And what happened
was-- and, you know,

00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:09.400
I received that feedback
of, you're not a good hire,

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:12.246
Tania Katan, get rid of her.

00:45:12.246 --> 00:45:15.820
I got an email-- and do you ever
get that ominous email that's--

00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:19.880
everyone-- all employees,
meet in the boardroom.

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:22.150
I received an email
from HR that was that

00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:24.820
and I was like, oh, my god.

00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:27.370
And so, I kind of
like slowly walked in.

00:45:27.370 --> 00:45:29.410
I walked in the
room everybody was

00:45:29.410 --> 00:45:32.080
seated there and very stiff.

00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:35.410
And, all of a sudden,
the head of HR said,

00:45:35.410 --> 00:45:38.030
Tania, we'd like to
present you with something.

00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:40.180
And a video camera comes
up and they present me

00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:44.282
with this big plaque that says,
Almost Employee of the Month.

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:51.950
And, to me, that's
the best metric

00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:57.240
for succeeding is that not
only are they connecting,

00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:00.255
but they're also engaging
in play and creativity.

00:46:00.255 --> 00:46:01.880
So, that was a really
wonderful moment.

00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:03.270
Thank you for asking.

00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:05.240
Yeah.

00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:08.970
Well, thank you so
much for having me.

00:46:08.970 --> 00:46:09.970
I appreciate it.

00:46:09.970 --> 00:46:11.820
[APPLAUSE]
