00:00:06.172 --> 00:00:07.974
Narrator:
LifeMed HAS AN ENTIRE FLEET

00:00:07.974 --> 00:00:10.776
RANGING FROM LEARJETS
TO CESSNAS.

00:00:10.776 --> 00:00:14.380
BUT ONLY ONE OF THEIR EMERGENCY
AIRCRAFT CAN MANEUVER ITS WAY

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.285
INTO THE TOUGHEST-TO-REACH
TERRAIN OF SOUTH-CENTRAL ALASKA.

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:22.121
IT MEASURES IN AT 42 FEET,

00:00:22.121 --> 00:00:25.091
THE LENGTH
OF AN AVERAGE SCHOOL BUS.

00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:28.594
IT TOPS OUT
AT 178 MILES PER HOUR,

00:00:28.594 --> 00:00:33.432
NEARLY 20 MILES PER HOUR FASTER
THAN AN AVERAGE HELICOPTER.

00:00:33.432 --> 00:00:34.600
I WOULD DESCRIBE IT

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.970
AS THE SPORTS CAR
OF THE HELICOPTER WORLD.

00:00:39.138 --> 00:00:43.476
Narrator: THIS IS THE
A-STAR 350 B2 HELICOPTER.

00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:46.946
THE A-STAR IS EQUIPPED
WITH AN I.V. INFUSION SYSTEM

00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:51.083
THAT CAN RUN THREE SEPARATE
I.V.s TO A PATIENT AT ONCE.

00:00:51.083 --> 00:00:52.585
A LIQUID OXYGEN SYSTEM

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:55.187
HOLDS MORE THAN 30 TIMES
THE OXYGEN BY VOLUME

00:00:55.187 --> 00:00:56.689
THAN AN AVERAGE TANK.

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:58.858
Woman: THIS LITTLE, TINY BALL
CAN ACTUALLY HOLD

00:00:58.858 --> 00:01:02.462
LIKE SIX HOURS WORTH OF OXYGEN.

00:01:02.462 --> 00:01:04.530
Narrator: THE DEFIBRILLATOR
HOLDS ENOUGH CHARGE

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.167
TO BE USED
FOR SIX HOURS AT A TIME.

00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:09.402
THEY SHOCK THE GUY,
AND THEY'LL BE DOING CPR,

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:12.238
AND YOU CAN FEEL
THE WHOLE HELICOPTER MOVE.

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:15.641
Narrator:
AND A HEAVY-DUTY PORTABLE
STRETCHER CALLED THE MEGAMOVER

00:01:15.641 --> 00:01:18.778
CAN LIFT NEARLY THE WEIGHT
OF A POLAR BEAR.

00:01:21.747 --> 00:01:25.551
WHILE THE INSIDE OF THE A-STAR
IS BUILT LIKE AN I.C.U.,

00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:29.488
THE OUTSIDE IS BUILT TO TACKLE
ALASKA'S EXTREME ELEMENTS.

00:01:29.488 --> 00:01:31.724
THE MAIN FEATURE ON THE A-STAR

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:34.894
ARE THESE BEARPAWS
OR TUNDRA SHOES.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.999
JUST GIVE THE HELICOPTER
A LITTLE BIT OF FLOAT.

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:42.902
Narrator: MADE FROM LIGHTWEIGHT,
HIGH-PERFORMANCE POLYMER,

00:01:42.902 --> 00:01:46.238
BEARPAWS WORK THE SAME WAY
AS SNOWSHOES.

00:01:46.238 --> 00:01:47.573
THEIR WIDE BASE

00:01:47.573 --> 00:01:51.210
EVENLY DISTRIBUTES THE A-STAR'S
WEIGHT UPON LANDING.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.780
THIS PREVENTS
THE HEAVIEST SECTION, THE TAIL,

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.283
FROM SPIKING INTO THE GROUND
OR SINKING INTO DEEP SNOW.
