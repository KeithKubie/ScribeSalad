action is you have to understand what

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130
action is you have to understand what

I think the best way to do that is the
so-called Stroop tests so we're gonna

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070
so-called Stroop tests so we're gonna
 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.670
so-called Stroop tests so we're gonna
flash a word on the screen and you

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680
flash a word on the screen and you
 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.130
flash a word on the screen and you
should say aloud the color that it's

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140
should say aloud the color that it's
 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.480
