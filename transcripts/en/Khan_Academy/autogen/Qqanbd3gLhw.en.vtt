00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.600
 Linear function - example 1 

00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.740
 In my last video, we tried to calculate 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.410
 Wall surface area of ​​this strange building 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.880
 We have the accumulated f(xy) of xy to indicate the ceiling area. 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.800
 f(xy) is equal to x plus the square of y 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.030
 Then the ground of the building, or the outline of the wall 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.100
 Then there is an arc with a radius of 2 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.230
 Plus part of the y-axis, then left 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.450
 Including a part of the x-axis, this is our building 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.790
 In the previous video 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:32.830
 We calculated the surface area of ​​the first wall 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.570
 In fact, our real purpose should be 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.730
 Calculate this linear integral from the straight line segment to the curve 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.360
 This is a closed line integral along the constant c 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:51.770
 Set to the equation f for xy 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.720
 We often multiply the integrand f(xy) by the length of the curve (in ds) 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.550
 We try to represent it in the most abstract way. 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.800
 The easiest way we learned from the previous video 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.560
 Is to break the whole problem into multiple segments 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.990
 Multiple curves, or multiple different problems to solve 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.700
 Imagine this whole wall outline 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.900
 All line segments, curve segments, we call it c 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.330
 As you can see from the previous video, this is c1 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.430
 This paragraph, I made a mark, it is c2 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.010
 Now I mean this is c3 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.640
 Let's redefine it, or break it down 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.540
 Decompose the entire closed linear integral into three independent linear integrals 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.340
 The entire line integral is equal to 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:40.560
 Linear integral of c1 segment plus c2 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.900
 Plus, you may have guessed, haha, c3 points 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.930
 In the previous video 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.340
 We figured out the first part 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.490
 The entire curved wall here 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.870
 The surface area of ​​the wall is 4+2 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.960
 Now we need to calculate the remaining two parts 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.850
 Ok, let's start calculating c2 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.600
 If you want to calculate it 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.540
 Also write a parameter for x and y 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.620
 And this will be different from the parameters of c1 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.570
 We are no longer focused on this arc. 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.390
 We are on the y-axis 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.570
 As long as it is on the y-axis 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:19.750
 The x coefficient is always 0 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.060
 These are my parameters, x=0 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.070
 When we are on the y-axis, x is always equal to 0. 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.710
 Next is the y coefficient, we can first set y equal to 2 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:37.790
 Or, we can say that y is equal to 2 minus t 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.230
 t is greater than or equal to 0, less than or equal to 2 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.270
 This is the correct parameter 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.300
 When t is equal to 0, at this point 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.900
 But when t increases to t equals 2 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.270
 Point t will move down the y axis to point t=2 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.080
 here 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.780
 This is our correct parameter 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.530
 Let's analyze this line c2 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.250
 We can also try to calculate the derivative 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.920
 What is the derivative of x=0? 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.290
 Let me write, what is the dt point dx 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.230
 Directly speaking 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:09.550
 The derivative of 0 is 0 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:10.400
 The dy of dt is the derivative of this formula 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.930
 That is -1, right? 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.030
 2 minus the derivative of t, is negative 1 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.940
 Then let's analyze it again. 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.540
 This line here 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.635
 That is, linear integral c2 

00:03:25.635 --> 00:03:28.490
 I will put c2 here first, we can still say 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:35.450
 From t equals 0 to t equals 2, then f(xy) 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:42.690
 f(xy) is this stuff, x plus y squared 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.090
 Then multiply by ds 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.420
 Then multiply by ds 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.410
 everybody knows 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:57.350
 Ds can also be expressed as the dt of the dt minus the dt of the dt under the root number 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.340
 That is, the square of 0 under the root number is reduced by 1, that is, plus 1 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.910
 Multiply the whole dt 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.390
 Very clear and beautiful 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.640
 Here is 0 plus 1, plus the root number, the whole is 1 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.260
 Then what is x? 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.330
 x, if we write according to the previous parameters 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.780
 x will always be equal to 0, and the square of y will be equal to 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.280
 2 minus t the square of the whole 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.490
 So this will be 2 minus t the square of the whole 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.020
 Finally, let’s simplify this whole crazy formula. 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:34.240
 From t equals 0 to t equals 2, the x value will disappear from the argument 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.330
 x is 0, no matter what t is equal to 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.070
 We have the square of y, y is equal to 2 minus t 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:47.180
 So 2 minus t the square of the whole 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.440
 Finally, there is a lonely dt 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.840
 This process is straightforward 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.910
 I think it would be easier to find the anti-derivatives. 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.780
 You can directly mentally calculate 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.610
 But what I like is 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:00.720
 Multiply this binomial 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.340
 So this line integral is equal to 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:16.230
 From t equals 0 to t equals 2, 4 minus 4t plus squared t 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:21.690
 Multiply dt 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.290
 Still very directly 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:27.150
 The whole is 4t minus 2t square 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.750
 4t minus 2t, right? 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.580
 2 times negative 2 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:43.200
 Get negative 4t, then add a third of the cube, right? 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.190
 Simple anti-derivatives of these things 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.300
 What we need is from 0 to 2 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.180
 Ok, let's make t equal to 2 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.140
 4 by 2 is 8, let me change a color 

00:05:54.140 --> 00:06:02.560
 4 times 2 is 8, minus 2 times 2 squares, which is 8, then added 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:08.800
 1/3 by 2 cube 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.910
 So it is 1/3 by 8 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:11.970
 After offsetting 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.530
 The remaining 8 minus 8, the last is 8/3 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:17.530
 The final result is eight-eighth 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.470
 Must have another case where t is equal to 0 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:21.320
 The whole is equal to 0 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.180
 4 times 0, 2 times 0, the whole is 0 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.730
 Then subtract 0 

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.700
 Hey, we found the surface area of ​​the second wall. 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.210
 Hey, we found the surface area of ​​the second wall. 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:34.250
 This is finally equal to 8/3 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.890
 Now, only the last wall is left. 

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:37.380
 Then add them all together 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.640
 Get the last wall 

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.800
 I will list another parameter. 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.180
 I want you to see that picture. 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.620
 Ok, maybe I can copy another side. 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:46.990
 edit 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.590
 Haha, this is our picture. 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:52.250
 Start our last wall now 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.870
 This wall can be represented 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.930
 Expressed as c3 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.750
 Change color 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:06.420
 This is c, we have to calculate c3 f(xy) by ds 

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:10.170
 That is... I will write the parameters again. 

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:14.580
 Along this arc, if we assume x is equal to t 

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.770
 t is greater than or equal to 0 

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.420
 Less than or equal to 2, we will stay on the x-axis 

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.520
 So the y value is equal to 0 

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.650
 a direct parameter 

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:29.100
 This is equal to f(xy) from t equals 0 to t equals 2 

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:37.845
 That is... 

00:07:37.845 --> 00:07:41.860
 I use xy directly 

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.760
 x plus y, multiply by ds 

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.970
 Ok, what is dx? Well, let me write down ds 

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:48.690
 Multiply ds 

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:50.520
 This is our theme 

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.870
 Now we know ds 

00:07:52.870 --> 00:08:01.030
 Ds is equal to the square of the dx of the dt under the root number 

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:04.940
 Plus dt points the square of the dy overall, multiply dt 

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.510
 We have already proven it in the first video. 

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.690
 Or we have probably understood why 

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:09.980
 Will be like this 

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:12.560
 Then what is the derivative of x under the influence of t 

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.890
 Is 1, this is equal to 1 

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:17.250
 The square of 1 is the same as 1 

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.030
 The derivative of y is still 0 

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:22.840
 0, 1 plus 0 equals 1, root number 1 or 1 

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:27.090
 This thing is dt 

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:30.290
 Ds will be equal to dt 

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:33.510
 So this is the value of dt 

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:37.515
 Then, because x is equal to t 

00:08:37.515 --> 00:08:40.460
 y is equal to 0 

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.090
 So ignore the existence of y 

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:43.710
 This is a super invincible simple line score 

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:47.580
 After simplification, by t equal to 0 to equal to 2 times dt 

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:54.540
 Anti-derivative t 

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:58.240
 Equal to 1/2t square, t has two values 

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:01.160
 When t is equal to 2 

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:05.780
 The square of 2 is 4, multiplied by one-half is equal to 2, and then reduced by 0. 

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:08.410
 Because 1/2 times 0 square, it is 0 

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:12.860
 In this way, we have the third wall, equal to 2 

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.390
 Very direct 

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:19.580
 So that area is 2 

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:23.270
 Ok, what to answer is the value of this linear integral. 

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:27.420
 f(xy) 

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:28.870
 We will add these numbers together 

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:32.980
 4 plus 2 plus 8/3 plus 2 

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:39.530
 Addition and subtraction calculation 

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:44.290
 Addition and subtraction calculation 

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:47.880
 Addition and subtraction calculation 

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.470
 Finally plus 2 factions 

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:51.550
 End! ! 

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:52.190
 It’s finally over! ! 

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:55.210
 Now we can use vector functions 

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:57.460
 To solve the linear integral. 

00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:57.600
 Thank you! Translated by MikeHe mikehe0410@gmail.com
