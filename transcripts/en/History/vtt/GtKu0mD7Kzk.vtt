00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.235
- So cool.

00:00:02.235 --> 00:00:03.370
Rocking and rolling.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.005
Where'd Frank go?
(SHOUTING) Frank?

00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:07.173
I'm looking around.

00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:08.575
Frank.

00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:10.877
Find anything?

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:11.711
Mike.

00:00:11.711 --> 00:00:12.979
What?

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:14.013
Oilzum?

00:00:14.013 --> 00:00:16.082
- We got Oilzum.
- I don't know.

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:17.684
A whole case?
Killer.

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:20.487
MIKE (VOICEOVER): Hands down,
Frank is the oil can guy.

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:21.521
Oil can central.

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:22.922
MIKE (VOICEOVER):
That's what he collects.

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:24.391
That's what he loves the most.

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:26.960
But he knows that
I'm the Oilzum guy.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.261
I love Oilzum.

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:29.696
I always have.
I love the logo.

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:31.431
I love the history
of the company.

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:32.599
I love the color.

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.667
Hell, I even like
the way it smells.

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:35.769
Empty.

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:37.137
FRANK: That doesn't look so hot.

00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:39.572
Oh, oh, oh.

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:41.207
Oh my goodness.

00:00:44.177 --> 00:00:45.512
It's in there.

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:46.679
You got something
to pop it open?

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:47.547
- Yeah.
- Uh oh.

00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:48.415
Frank's got it.
What do you got?

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:49.416
Oh yeah, baby.
Look at that.

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:50.717
Oh, yeah.
Look at that.

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:51.584
- Oh.
- Oh, yeah.

00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:52.252
This is it.
This is it.

00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:53.153
Oh, yeah.

00:00:53.153 --> 00:00:54.387
This is it.

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:57.490
Oilzum was one of the first
brand-name motor oils.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.192
From the quality
of their product,

00:00:59.192 --> 00:01:02.295
to their marketing genius,
and their connection

00:01:02.295 --> 00:01:05.465
to America's racing history,
and then on top of that,

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:08.301
that incredible logo,
you cannot think

00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:10.570
gas and oil without Oilzum.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.372
It's that iconic.
- Oh, yeah.

00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:14.441
You got it.

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:15.208
Oh, yeah.

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:16.843
See, Jay?
- See, Jay?

00:01:16.843 --> 00:01:18.812
A little patience.

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:19.946
This end's open.

00:01:19.946 --> 00:01:21.681
Right there.

00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:22.649
Come on.

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:24.451
Oh, baby, there we go.

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:26.252
Now, here, let me
do it over here.

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:27.287
Here, you got it?
You got it?

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:28.154
Yeah.

00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:28.955
Want me to hold
the light on it?

00:01:28.955 --> 00:01:29.689
- Yeah, go ahead.
- Yeah.

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:30.023
Get that.
- Surgery?

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:34.461
You gotta get it.

00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:35.528
- It's gonna crack right there.
- I know.

00:01:35.528 --> 00:01:36.396
That's what I'm saying.

00:01:36.396 --> 00:01:37.931
There it comes.
I'm getting it.

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:38.965
Yeah, that's it.

00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:40.233
- Ah.
- There, now you can.

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:41.367
- There it is.
- All right.

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:42.235
- Now you can get the can out.
- Are you ready?

00:01:42.235 --> 00:01:43.169
I'm ready.

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:44.103
All right, Frank,
hold the light.

00:01:44.103 --> 00:01:45.572
- This is it.
- This is it.

00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:47.373
And--

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:48.875
Whoa.

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:51.544
- Oh.
- Ah.

00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:53.847
Ah, this paper label.

00:01:53.847 --> 00:01:54.914
Oh.

00:01:54.914 --> 00:01:56.316
Paper.

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:59.352
Ugh, paper.

00:01:59.352 --> 00:02:00.987
But underneath the
paper, it looks like--

00:02:00.987 --> 00:02:02.155
- I know.
- You know?

00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:03.223
I know.

00:02:03.223 --> 00:02:04.691
MIKE (VOICEOVER):
You can find the box.

00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:06.226
And you can find the can.

00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:08.761
But to find the can in
the box with the paper

00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:12.198
label on it that's never been
opened before is super rare.

00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:14.868
And it says "high pressure,
superheated steam cylinder

00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:16.135
oil."
- Wow.

00:02:16.135 --> 00:02:17.470
You know what that's for?

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.605
Locomobiles.

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:20.306
That's exactly what it's
for is steam engines.

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:21.608
Steam engines.

00:02:21.608 --> 00:02:25.011
As soon as I saw the
can, I said something.

00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:29.816
I said an expletive to myself,
meaning that now, Jay-- for god

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:33.620
sakes, now, you know, it's
time to stand up or sit down.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.387
That's a great can.

00:02:34.387 --> 00:02:37.156
That's a great can.

00:02:37.156 --> 00:02:38.958
[sighing]

00:02:41.928 --> 00:02:43.129
It was good.

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:44.964
And that's what the problem was.

00:02:44.964 --> 00:02:47.300
It was almost too good to sell.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.369
I wish I had another one.

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:50.703
You didn't even
know you had that one.

00:02:50.703 --> 00:02:51.404
I know I didn't.

00:02:51.404 --> 00:02:53.306
I would know eventually.

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:58.411
400 and-- 400, and it's gone.

00:02:58.411 --> 00:03:03.082
I'll even put the
cover back on for you.

00:03:03.082 --> 00:03:05.118
- Where's my 10%?
- All right.

00:03:05.118 --> 00:03:06.452
We're doing it.

00:03:06.452 --> 00:03:08.021
MIKE (VOICEOVER): It's great
that it's in the box instead

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:09.422
of just a can on a shelf.

00:03:09.422 --> 00:03:12.492
Because, you know, just to
show it to somebody and go,

00:03:12.492 --> 00:03:16.062
look at this Oilzum can in
the box, is a mind bender.

00:03:16.062 --> 00:03:17.430
Could you say ah for a minute?

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.264
Ah.

00:03:18.264 --> 00:03:19.732
Oh, that's for pulling my tooth?

00:03:19.732 --> 00:03:20.733
Exactly.

00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:22.001
This is 1880.

00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:23.970
And the way this
works-- it was patented.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.605
As you squeeze--
- It would cut your tooth off?

00:03:25.605 --> 00:03:27.006
No.

00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:29.709
As you squeeze the handle, the
first thing it does, it grabs--

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:30.810
It grabs the tooth?

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.278
It grabs the tooth
beside the bad tooth.

00:03:32.278 --> 00:03:33.813
And then as you grab
a little further--

00:03:33.813 --> 00:03:34.681
Ew.

00:03:34.681 --> 00:03:36.950
--it pushes the
other tooth out.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.952
FRANK (VOICEOVER): I mean, this
is one of those things where

00:03:38.952 --> 00:03:40.653
they say, no pain, no gain.

00:03:40.653 --> 00:03:42.121
And what would something
like this go for?

00:03:42.121 --> 00:03:44.457
Uh, $20.

00:03:44.457 --> 00:03:45.425
You got a deal.

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:46.459
I'll never see
another one like it.

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:47.827
I don't think you will either.

00:03:47.827 --> 00:03:50.029
After you leave this house,
you will never see another one.

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:51.064
Can we look in here?

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:52.198
Yep, sure.

00:03:52.198 --> 00:03:54.033
These two boxes, these
are things that we've

00:03:54.033 --> 00:03:55.568
decided that we don't need.

00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:57.270
They're not part of
the core collection.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.072
And if you want to take them
and put them on the table

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:00.440
and take a look--
- Let's see.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.341
Yeah, let's take a quick look.

00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:05.044
Oh, boy.

00:04:05.044 --> 00:04:06.579
FRANK (VOICEOVER): Jay
says that this isn't

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:07.981
part of the core collection.

00:04:07.981 --> 00:04:10.483
But I'm getting a little nervous
there's price tags on them.

00:04:10.483 --> 00:04:12.752
The tags are on here because
this has been inventoried.

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:14.253
We have a clock
person that's come

00:04:14.253 --> 00:04:16.255
and looked at all our clocks.
- OK.

00:04:16.255 --> 00:04:18.291
- So the tag has a retail price.
- All right.

00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:19.959
These would mount
on the dash of a car.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:20.960
This one I really like.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.061
I mean, look at the mount.

00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:23.796
The mount's right
there, goes right up.

00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:25.131
It's kind of looking
right at you.

00:04:25.131 --> 00:04:27.166
You don't have to take your
eyes off the road too much.

00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:29.502
Got a few little pocket watches.
- Yep.

00:04:29.502 --> 00:04:31.104
- Got some emblems here.
- Yes.

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:32.639
FRANK (VOICEOVER): He's
got three head badges.

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.807
And these would go on the
front grille of a car.

00:04:34.807 --> 00:04:36.342
These are great
collectible items.

00:04:36.342 --> 00:04:43.082
FRANK: Yeah, just these six
pieces here, how about 650?

00:04:43.082 --> 00:04:44.984
Ah, that's a-- that's
a little low, 650.

00:04:44.984 --> 00:04:46.185
And I was probably
more like, do you

00:04:46.185 --> 00:04:48.087
wanna split the difference
between 8 and 650?

00:04:48.087 --> 00:04:49.422
I'll do it.

00:04:49.422 --> 00:04:50.423
7 and a quarter.

00:04:50.423 --> 00:04:51.424
7 and a quarter.
