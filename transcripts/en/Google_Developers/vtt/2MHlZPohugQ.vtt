[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:12.900
STUDENT: Google Classroom
is mission control

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.290
for teachers and students.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.520
With Google Classroom, you
can create new courses,

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.230
enroll teachers and
students, and have

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.980
students submit assignments.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.910
With the launch of
the Classroom API,

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.330
you can now seamlessly
integrate your apps

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.760
into Google Classroom.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.990
TEACHER: And you'll be
working off your own laptops,

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.750
so make sure--

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.950
STUDENT: The API provides
a RESTful interface

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.000
to help you manage and
provision classes at scale.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.250
TEACHER: So let's get started.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.620
Let's talk about
the Classroom API.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.400
Please come in and sit down.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.180
The Classroom API enables
you to create new courses

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.410
and specify a name,
a section, and room.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.450
Each course can be
further described

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.950
through the description
heading and description fields.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.280
Each course also has
the state indicating

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.290
whether it's provisioned,
archived, actived,

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.310
declined, or unspecified.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.230
Now, we know a
lot about courses.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.670
You can't have courses
without teachers and students.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.140
So let's see how
those two differ.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.710
Teachers can create new courses
and manage course enrollments.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:18.530
Yes.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.950
STUDENT: Students can
list course details

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.880
or view the teachers
for that course.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.300
The documentation says
that students and teachers

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.097
are identified by unique
ID or email address.

00:01:30.097 --> 00:01:31.430
Where do they get those details?

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:32.260
TEACHER: Right.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.760
STUDENT: Oh!

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.470
They're returned by
the Google Admin SDK.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.670
TEACHER: Right.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.310
There are several ways to
enroll students and teachers

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.730
into a course.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.370
The first is programmatically,
directly through the API.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:50.890
So here we will enroll teachers
and students into the course.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:51.720
Yes.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.830
STUDENT: Another way is
to send them an invite.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.530
Now, it says here to
send an invite you merely

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.100
need the user ID of
the teacher or student,

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.420
the course ID of
the intended course,

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.670
and the role for that user.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.770
Then you can accept or
reject these invitations

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.380
using the Classroom API.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.289
TEACHER: Right.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.009
STUDENT: So we've
done enrollments.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.312
What about assignments?

00:02:12.312 --> 00:02:13.270
TEACHER: Good question.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.570
The Classroom Share button
makes it easy for your users

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.510
to submit files.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.350
You as developers simply have
to drop the button on your page,

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.480
include the necessary
JavaScript resources,

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.170
and then add a target URL.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.940
[BELL RINGS]

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.190
TEACHER: Once you've done
this the rest of the process

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.630
is taken care of for you-- yeah.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.040
The Classroom API lets
you integrate your apps

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.330
with Google Classroom.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.070
You can create courses,
enroll teachers and students,

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.140
and have students
submit assignments.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.580
I hope you've been paying close
attention in this DevByte,

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.700
because there will be an exam
in a couple of weeks' time.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.087
Slow down!

00:02:51.087 --> 00:02:53.420
STUDENT: But if you haven't
been paying close attention,

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.460
don't worry about it.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.060
Because the documentation and
samples at this link will get

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.400
you started quickly.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.270
Who said you can't cram at the
last minute and be successful?

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.006
