00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.570
We are going to do the first of
three lectures on the last topic.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.140
We're going to talk about phase
diagrams starting today,

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.710
Monday, and wrap it up on Wednesday.
Phase diagrams is related to the

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.280
question of stability and sustaining
the solid state.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.850
And, we talked about the behavior
of solids, and we've used solids in

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.420
order to teach the rudiments of
chemistry. But today,

00:00:47.420 --> 00:01:07.173
I want to talk about the conditions
under which solids are stable.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:55.520
And, under what conditions do solids
remain stable when do they become

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.050
unstable? This is important in
industry, for example.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.580
If you're running a cast shop,
you're making auto parts; you want

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.110
to know what the solidification
temperature is of a particular alloy.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.640
It's important in failure analysis,
something like the fall of the World

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.170
Trade Center, looking at the metal
specimens to determine,

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.700
what was the mode of failure?
The temperature excursions leave a

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.230
signature, a thermal signature
indicative of the history of what

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.150
happened to that object.
And, by determining whether

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.450
something went above a certain phase
transformation temperature,

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.760
we can retrace, reconstruct the
incident. And you might say,

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.070
well, gee, what's the big deal?
I mean, you look up in the tables,

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.380
everybody knows that water boils at
100¡C. But, maybe it's not so

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.690
simple. Let's say you decide to
realize your life's ambitions.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:02:04.180
And you're going to go climb Mount
Everest.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:53.750
So, you plop down $10,
00, you get a permit from the

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:12.933
Nepalese government.
The next thing you know,

00:01:37.500 --> 00:02:01.250
you're at base camp, 20,000 feet.
You have a hankering for soft

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:19.900
boiled egg. So,
you pitch a campfire,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:02:08.750
put on the eggs: five minutes,
10 minutes, 15 minutes. Pardon me,

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:29.333
you want hard-boiled eggs. After 15
minutes, you open the eggs and

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:16.250
they're still running.
You get really steamed.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:36.900
You go 20 minutes, 25 minutes,
every time. The yoke is still runny.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:23.520
The white is converted,
but the yoke is still runny.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.050
What's going on? Well, we talked
about denaturing.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.580
The white denatures at 65¡C.
But at 20,000 feet, the atmospheric

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.110
pressure is reduced to the point
that water boils at below the

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.640
denaturing temperature of the egg
yolk. So, you can boil until the

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.170
end of time. You'll always have
soft boiled eggs.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.700
If you like soft boiled eggs,
you cannot screw up. You cannot

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.230
screw up, OK? So,
what do we know from this little

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.880
anecdote?
This little anecdote is that the

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.640
boiling point is a function of
pressure. So,

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.410
it's not that simple.
Let's go to another place.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.170
Let's go under the hood of a car,
one of my favorite places. OK, so

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.930
here's what's going on under the
hood of a car.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.700
Here, you got the engine,
and inside the engine we've got

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.460
combustion. And the combustion
gives off a huge amount of heat.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.230
We have to dissipate the heat. So,
we have water channels running

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:37.260
through the engine and
out to the radiator.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
And the radiator cools this water
before recirculating it,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
thanks to the action of either fan,
or wind, or some kind of movement of

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
air. And so, what's the principle
here? The principle here is that

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
inside the radiator,
we've got solid. This is the rad,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and it's probably made of, in the
old days, they made them out of

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
copper. But nowadays,
they're making more and more of them

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
out of aluminum.
And, we have liquid,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:53.820
which is the coolant.
This is the coolant.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.460
This is water. And,
we have a big delta T here,

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.110
right? This is hot and this is cool.
And so, we have a heat flux going

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.760
in this direction.
And, this is working great because

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.400
the density of water is high,
and so therefore it's able to

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.050
transfer heat very efficiently.
So, this is good. This is really

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.700
good. What can happen if things go
out of control?

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.350
Things go out of control,
and we start to boil. And,

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:39.900
you know that the boiling point of
water is more or less 100¡C.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:26.290
We are down here.
We are not at the base camp of

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.580
Mount Everest.
Here's what happens when things

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.880
start to go out of control.
We start to get gas bubbles.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.170
These are the gas bubbles
associated with the boiling of water.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.470
And, now, the heat transfer between
gas and solid,

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.760
between gas and solid is very poor.
Think about it. What's

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.050
transferring the heat?
It's the atoms. And the atom

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.350
density in a gas is sparse.
So, gas is a very poor heat

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.070
transfer medium.
So, we must avoid boiling.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.210
If we get boiling, then we get into
a thermal runaway situation because

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.350
now we've got boiling in the first
place because the water was too hot.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.490
But now we're doing a less
efficient job of cooling,

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.640
and it's going to get worse,
and worse, and worse until finally:

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.780
boom. So, what I want to do is I
want to get my liquid range.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.920
I want to tailor the properties of
the coolant. I want a coolant that

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.570
will be boiled over proof.
So, if I could raise the boiling

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.730
point, that would make the cars
safer to drive under extreme

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.890
conditions. Typically what happens
is you are zooming down the highway

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.050
on a hot summer's day,
and then there is some reason to

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.200
come to an abrupt stop.
And then, there's all that heat to

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.360
be dissipated.
And, no more do you get the benefit

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.520
of the motion of the car.
Now you're just relying on the fan.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.680
So, what can we do? If we go to
the top of Everest,

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.840
and the pressure goes down,
and the boiling point falls,

00:05:46.840 --> 00:06:07.480
could I raise the boiling point by
applying more pressure?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:54.130
Yeah, let's put a pressure cap on
the radiator. Let's keep the

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:58.260
contents of the radiator high.
And if you read the top, it will

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.390
say 15 psi, which is 1 atmosphere.
So, I've got 1 atmosphere here plus

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.530
an extra atmosphere.
So, I'm running a 2 atmospheres

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.660
pressure. So,
that will raise the boiling point

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.790
and stave off the dangerous gas
evolution. And now,

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:18.930
I can do one more thing.
Instead of running pure water,

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:23.060
I'll add ethylene glycol.
I'll add ethylene glycol about 50/50

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.180
per volume. You know this is
antifreeze. It gives a freezing

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.310
point depression.
We'll talk about that next day.

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.430
But it also gives boiling point
elevation. So,

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:39.550
in the summertime,
you should always run with

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.680
antifreeze because the combination
of the pressure cap plus the

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.810
addition of the glycol raises the
boiling point from 212.

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.930
I'm talking about cars,
so I am going to use Fahrenheit here,

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:56.160
212¡F to 265¡F.
This buys you a much higher cushion.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.490
So, what are we doing? We are
tailoring this by making the boiling

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:04.830
point a function of pressure.
And now I'm showing you that it's

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:09.160
also a function of composition.
So, this whole business of

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.490
solid-state stability I hope I'm
showing you has a little bit more to

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:17.830
it than just looking up the
transformation temperature on the

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:37.426
periodic table or the handbook.
So, I want to talk to you for the

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:07.500
next three lectures about phase
diagrams. Phase diagrams are

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:12.500
atlases. They are maps.
They are maps of stability that

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:17.500
answer the question,
if you specify pressure,

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:22.500
composition, temperature,
what are the stable phases?

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:27.500
So, that's what you need to know.
So, let's talk about phase diagrams

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:52.570
as stability maps.
The stability of what?

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:57.710
The stability of the state of
aggregation. It's going to tell us

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:02.850
if it's solid,
liquid, gas, and under what

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:07.990
circumstances?
So, let's look at some simple phase

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:13.140
diagrams. But before we can do it,
I need to define some terms for you.

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:18.280
So, first of all, let's define the
term phase. The phrase is a region

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:23.420
of a substance that has the
following characteristics: uniform

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:28.450
in chemical composition.
It's uniform in chemical composition.

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:33.360
The second thing about it is that
it's physically distinct.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:38.270
And I'll give you some rich
examples. I want to put this down

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:43.180
just to document it and then after
you see a few examples,

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:48.090
these words will mean something to
you. So, it's physically distinct.

00:08:48.090 --> 00:09:06.313
And in the extreme, it's
mechanically separable.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:56.640
It's physically distinct and
mechanically separable.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.290
So, let's look at some examples of
one-phase and two-phase systems.

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:03.930
And, this is one of these days
where we are using symbols to mean

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:07.580
multiple meanings,
I've already used P to represent

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:11.230
pressure. If I use P now to
represent number of phases,

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:14.870
you won't be able to tell one from
the other. So,

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:18.520
I feel a little bit western today.
So, I'll make it circle P. So,

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:22.170
circle P equals number of phases,
not to be confused with P, which is

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:27.200
the pressure.
So, number of phases I designate by

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:43.800
circle P. So,
let's look at some simple single

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:20.000
phase systems.
So, let's look at P equals one.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:46.400
So, how about pure water? Pure
water liquid, have a beaker of water,

00:09:46.400 --> 00:10:04.466
it's uniform chemical composition,
physically distinct, mechanically

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:57.850
separable. How about white gold?
White gold consists of an alloy of

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:01.570
certainly gold to which we add
silver and we add nickel.

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:05.280
And these are all FCC metals.
And at the atomistic level, you

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.990
have them substituting for one
another on the gold lattice.

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:12.710
And so, I have uniform chemical
composition. I have no boundaries.

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:16.420
There could be grain boundaries,
but that's different.

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:20.140
But the grain boundaries do not
represent something that is a

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:24.230
difference in chemical composition.
So, this is pure and this is a

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:28.690
solution. So,
if it's a pure material or a

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:33.150
solution it will qualify as single
phase. Let's look.

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:37.610
So, here's a liquid.
Here's a solid. Let's look at a

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:42.070
gas. How about air?
Air is a solution of nitrogen,

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:46.530
oxygen, argon, increasingly CO2 in
the city when you've got coal

00:10:46.530 --> 00:11:04.660
burning for electric
power. There's SO2.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:54.860
Oh, let's not forget our pal nitrous
oxide. And if you live near an

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:58.730
Alcoa smelter,
you will have CF4.

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:02.590
If you live near a magnesium
smelter you'll smell chlorine.

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:06.460
But in Cambridge, mercifully, we
just have to enjoy these.

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:10.330
So, and this is all single phase.
You don't see the gases settling

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:14.190
according to density.
They mix intimately in all

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:18.060
proportions. And,
one more solid: calcia zirconia.

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:22.140
We talked about this one before.
This is the lime stabilizer zirconia

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:26.420
for oxygen sensors and,
I'll show you later that this is the

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:30.710
material that's used for the faux
diamond. This is a solid solution:

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:34.990
calcium ion sitting on zirconium
site. So, this is single phase.

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:39.280
There's no calcium islands, calcium
oxide islands and zirconium oxide

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.570
islands. This is a solid solution.
So, therefore, it's all one phase.

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:47.850
Now, let's contrast that to
something that's two-phase to get a

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:52.130
sense of what the difference is.
So instead of pure water,

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:56.390
just liquid, suppose I have ice
cubes in water.

00:11:56.390 --> 00:12:00.660
It's still pure.
I didn't change the composition,

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:04.930
but I've got two different states.
I've got a solid state and a liquid

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:09.190
state, and this fits the definition.
In other words, the ice floating in

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:13.460
the water is uniform in chemical
composition, and it's physically

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:17.730
distinct. Or,
I can say, I can put a boundary

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:36.793
around it. And,
I can isolate all of the ice cubes.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:26.130
And, in fact, these are mechanically
separable. I could pull out all of

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:30.260
the ice cubes and be left with only
the liquid, OK,

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:34.390
solid in liquid.
Two different phases because they

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:38.530
are two different states of the same
material. I think we also looked at

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:42.660
milk. We looked at milk,
and milk has fat globules in the

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:46.790
aqueous phase in the aqueous
solution. All right,

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:50.930
so, I've got fat globules.
They're very tiny, and they scatter

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:55.250
light.
But, if we got down to the micro

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:59.750
level, we could find these fat
globules as something that's

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:04.250
mechanically separable,
physically distinct, and of uniform

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:08.750
composition, and different from this.
So, this is two different phases

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:13.250
because we have two different
compositions. We have two different

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:17.750
compositions, and lastly,
there was the visions cookware,

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:22.760
the Pyroceram.
That was the glass ceramic that's

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:28.300
95% crystalline and 5% glassy.
So, what you have here is you have

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:33.840
a glassy phase,
glassy matrix, and crystalline

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:39.380
precipitates. OK,
so again, we don't have a change in

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:44.920
composition, but we have a change in
atomic order. So,

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:50.460
the glassy phase and the devitrified
phase, so we can actually draw

00:13:50.460 --> 00:14:08.186
boundaries around all the
crystalline precipitate.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.500
So, I hope this gives you a sense of
what's going on here.

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:45.000
The second thing is these phase
diagrams are drawn under conditions

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.500
called equilibrium.
That's why we talk about stability.

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:54.000
So, let's define equilibrium.
Equilibrium is a condition which

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.500
represents the lowest energy state
of the system.

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:03.000
In other words,
if you take all of the constituents

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.500
and give them infinite time and the
energy they need to achieve the

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:12.000
lowest energy state,
this is where they will get to.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.800
And, we will know that it's the
equilibrium state because the

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:39.590
properties are invariant.
The properties are invariant with

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:43.390
time. This is sort of like a steady
state. But, steady state is

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:47.190
something that could be sort of
locked in on the road to stability.

00:14:47.190 --> 00:15:07.913
So, this is the ultimate stability,
as contrasted with metastability.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:54.860
Metastability is something that
steady state but could get stabler

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:58.730
yet. And the example of meta
stability is diamond,

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:02.590
which is not the stable form of
carbon at room temperature,

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:06.460
but diamond was formed under
different conditions and then

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:10.330
brought under ambient pressure and
temperature. But the activation

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:14.190
energy to convert is so high that it
stays apparently stable,

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:18.060
but in point of fact, it's
metastable. Another one

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:22.390
is metallic glass.
We know that metallic glass was

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:27.190
formed under high quench rates.
If you take metallic glass and heat

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:31.990
it moderately,
you'll give it sufficient activation

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:36.790
energy to then jump from this glassy
state to the crystalline state,

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:41.590
and ultimately achieve its
equilibrium value.

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:46.390
So, those are examples of the
equilibrium metastability.

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:51.190
And then, the last thing, as you
noticed, I talked about pure

00:15:51.190 --> 00:16:09.246
materials and then multicomponent
materials.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:16:01.810
They have different elements that
are mixed, and so we need a counter,

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:07.630
a metric, that details what the
level of chemical complexity is.

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:13.450
And for that, we call into play a
term called component.

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:19.270
And, it's the measure of chemical
complexity. What do I mean by that?

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:25.090
In the simplest terms, how many
bottles do I have to pull off the

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:31.140
shelf to make this thing, OK?
Bottles off the shelf.

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:37.420
And, again, this is best given by
illustration. So,

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:43.710
I'll show you a mix of components
and phases. So,

00:16:43.710 --> 00:17:01.686
we will do a little matrix here.
I'll start on a new board. So --

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:59.700
OK, so across the top,

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:03.110
I'll look at single phase and dual
phase. And down the column,

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:06.520
I'll look at one component, two
component, three component systems.

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:09.940
So, the simplest is up here, one,
one. One phase,

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:13.350
one component, so,
that's pure water. Pure water,

00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:16.760
all liquid, single phase, single
component. You could say,

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:20.170
but don't you need hydrogen and
oxygen? Well,

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:23.580
if you take one of the thermo
classes later,

00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:44.893
you will learn that the hydrogen and
oxygen are linked by stoichiometry.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:30.530
So, it's still one bottle off the
shelf. There is no variation in the

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:34.070
hydrogen to oxygen ratio.
Diamond, even though it's

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:37.610
metastable, all I need is carbon.
And it's single phase. There's no

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:41.150
change of phase across the diamond.
In many cases, the diamonds that

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:44.690
you will see, they are all single
crystal. Don't ever go to the

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:48.230
jeweler and ask for polycrystalline
diamond. It is not going

00:17:48.230 --> 00:18:07.326
to be very pretty.
OK, please remember that.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
So, let's look at something that's
now two components.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Well, that would be calcia zirconia,
right? It's one phase.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
It's a single solid solution,
but I needed two bottles. I needed

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
a bottle of calcium oxide,
and a bottle of zirconium oxide.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
But, they mix intimately, and I
have a single phase.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
And then, the white gold is the
gold, the silver,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
and the nickel, three different
elements. The mix intimately,

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:24.140
and they give me a single phase.
Over here, I've got one component.

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:28.420
So, I'm working only with, say,
water. So, this will be the ice

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:32.710
water, or I call it slush.
Two phases: and they are in

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:36.990
equilibrium. So,
this is at 0¡ C. and they are stable

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:41.280
over time. All right,
the lowest energy state invariant.

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:45.570
So, the slush remains stable. So,
you can have dynamics. Some of the

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:49.850
solid dissolves into liquid,
and some of the liquid freezes out

00:18:49.850 --> 00:19:08.100
as solid.
But the net change is zero,

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
stable, ice water, slush. The
second one we saw when we talked

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
about a solubility,
we looked at the next of carbon

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
tetrachloride and water,
two liquids. We shake them up,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
and they phase separate. I've been
using that term,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
phase separate, two phases.
There is an organic phase, or you

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
say a carbon rich phase,
a nonpolar phase, and a hydrogen

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:22.300
bonded phase.
So, these are immiscible,

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:26.920
and I'll have two components,
two phases. And then the last one,

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:31.530
this would be the Visions because
that consisted of lithium oxide,

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:36.150
alumina, and silica. I need to get
three bottles off the shelf.

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:40.760
Remember, I had a network former,
a network modifier, and an

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:45.380
intermediate. And that gave me this
remarkable two-phase mixture that

00:19:45.380 --> 00:20:03.893
triggered the exsolution
of a crystalline phase.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:53.750
So now, let's look at some real
example stability maps.

00:19:53.750 --> 00:20:13.400
So, I want to learn to crawl before
we learn to run.

00:19:37.500 --> 00:20:01.250
So, let's look at simple ones.
So, we're going to put C equals one.

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:21.166
So, this is pure materials.
C equals one, one component.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:20:08.750
And, we're going to look at, C
equals one, it's fixed.

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:28.333
All I have left then; we have
pressure composition.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:20:16.250
Temperature composition is fixed
because it doesn't vary here.

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:34.966
So, I just have to look at P versus
T.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:23.750
Those are the only variables that I
had to deal with.

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:44.333
So, let's look at some of these.
Now, the first one I want to look

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:31.250
at is one that you are pretty
familiar with: water.

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:50.766
Let's look at the phase diagram of
pure water. So,

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:38.750
we're going to plot how the phases
of water vary over pressure and

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:58.266
temperature. And,
I'm going to plot temperature in

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:46.250
degrees Celsius.
And I'm going to plot pressure in

00:20:46.250 --> 00:21:06.366
atmospheres, although I will give
you the conversion to SI.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.500
So, let me just put the general
diagram on. It's sort of a Y shaped

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:39.000
looking diagram.
So, lowest temperature,

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.500
this is where we have the solid
regime, solid water ice.

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:48.000
The highest temperature must be
where we have the gas or water vapor.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.500
And, in between,
we have the liquid.

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:57.000
And, these lines represent the
equilibria. These lines,

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.500
this one is the equilibrium between
liquid and vapor.

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:06.000
So, this is a liquid equals vapor
coexistence curve.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:30.830
And, it's not a single point.
This one here is solid and liquid

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:35.660
coexistence curve.
Now, you know some of the data

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:40.490
points on this graph.
We live at 1 atmosphere.

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:45.330
That's our world: the one
atmosphere isobar.

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:50.160
So, let's put P equals one.
And, you know that at one

00:21:50.160 --> 00:22:07.853
atmosphere, pure water
freezes at 0¡C.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:22:00.550
So, that's the point along the solid
liquid coexistence curve at 1

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:06.110
atmosphere applied pressure.
And, furthermore, you know that at

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:11.660
sea level where we have 1 atmosphere
pressure, the liquid turns to vapor

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:17.220
at 100¡ C. So,
when we go to Mount Everest,

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:22.140
we are over here.
See, we are at lower pressure.

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:26.420
And if we are at lower pressure,
we are at lower temperature. And

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:30.710
then, if we are in the radiator,
the cooling system of the car, we

00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:34.990
applied a higher pressure.
We trapped in a higher pressure,

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:39.280
and thereby extended the temperature
range over which the liquid is

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:43.570
stable. See, at two atmospheres,
the liquid is stable over a wider

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:47.850
range of temperature.
At one atmosphere, it's what we

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:51.760
know zero to 100 Celsius.
And at lower pressures,

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:55.290
it's stable over an even narrower
temperature range.

00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:58.820
So, the boiling point,
I'm showing you how it varies as a

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:02.350
function of pressure.
And, down here, we have,

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:05.880
this is solid equals vapor
coexistence curve.

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.410
Below a certain pressure,
you can go directly from solid to

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:12.940
vapor. If you hang your clothes out
on a clothesline and it is -20¡C,

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:16.460
the first thing that happens is the
water freezes.

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:37.520
But, if you come back hours later,
the clothes are dry. What happened?

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:24.260
Did somebody come in a truck,
grab all the clothes, and take them

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:28.530
down to the laundromat,
put them in the dryer, and then come

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:32.790
back and hang them on the
clothesline? How did it happen?

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:37.060
It went directly from solid to
vapor. This is sublimation.

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:41.330
This is sublimation. Here, liquid
goes to vapor is called evaporation.

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:45.590
Vapor goes to liquid is
condensation. These are the phase

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:49.860
transformations.
Solid goes to liquid: you know

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:54.060
that's melting.
And liquid goes to solid,

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:58.190
that is solidification. And I say
that without prejudice.

00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:02.330
It could be to form the glassy
solid or it could be to form the

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:06.460
amorphous solid.
And sublimation talks about both

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:10.590
directions: vapor to solid or solid
to vapor is sublimation.

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:14.730
So, this is a coexistence curve.
So, along here, we can even put

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:18.860
some labels. We can put over here
single phase, over here,

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:37.386
single phase, and over here single
phase.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:29.880
And, along these coexistence curves,
liquid equals vapor. So, I have two

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:36.770
phases along all the coexistence
curves. Look at this point here.

00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:43.660
That's a curiosity, isn't it? What
do I have here?

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:50.550
According to this diagram,
I have solid, liquid, and vapor in

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:55.920
equilibrium.
This is ice cubes in boiling water:

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:59.780
all three phases at this point here.
And this point, first of all, as

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:03.640
you can imagine,
not to scale because some of the

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:07.490
features are rather subtle.
It wouldn't be seen if I drew this

00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:11.350
to scale. This is at a very slight
elevation in temperature.

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:15.210
It's about one 100th of a degree
above zero Celsius.

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:19.070
And, the pressure here is about,
oh, it's not about, I know what it

00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:23.230
is. It's about 4.58 millimeters.
How want to squeeze that in here.

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:27.700
It's 4.58 mm of mercury. And, you
need to know that 1 atmosphere,

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:32.170
if you remember Torricelli and his
vacuum tube, it's 76 cm,

00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:36.640
or 760 mm of mercury. So,
that's the pressure. It's 4.

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:41.110
8 mm. And so, if you were to take
water, pour it into a beaker,

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:45.580
cover the beaker with some enclosure
that allowed you to pump the

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:50.050
temperature down,
eventually you would reach,

00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:54.520
excuse me, pump the pressure down,
eventually you'd reach the pressure

00:25:54.520 --> 00:26:12.706
at which water boils
at room temperature.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:26:04.400
Remember this number: 20-20,
roughly 20¡C, 20 mm of mercury,

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:22.866
round numbers. It is not exactly
that, but it's very close.

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:55.200
So, if you get 20 mm of mercury,
you will have boiling water at room

00:25:55.200 --> 00:26:20.600
temperature. But if you get down to
0¡C at just 100th of a degree higher,

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:39.533
you have all three phases: ice cubes
with water boiling in liquid.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:30.330
So, here we are with all of the
different phases.

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:34.660
And, this last thing I wanted to
tell you, last thing is,

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:38.990
you see this slope here? It's a
negative slope.

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:43.330
And, it kind of puzzles me because
when you look at it,

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:47.660
normally you would think,
you see, if you go at a constant

00:26:47.660 --> 00:27:08.053
temperature, let's say that we start
at 0¡ and very, very low pressure.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:55.330
So, we have something that's a gas.
And then, we press atoms closer and

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:58.660
closer together.
And then it says you make a solid.

00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:01.990
And then, at the constant
temperature, you press the solid

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:05.320
atoms closer together.
And it says you make a liquid again.

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:08.660
Doesn't that sound kind of
backwards? Wouldn't you think that

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:11.990
you start with gas atoms far apart?
Then you move closer, you get

00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:15.330
liquid atoms, and you press the
liquid atoms and you get a solid.

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:18.660
But water is special. Water is
special because the bonding in the

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:38.320
solid is more open than
bonding in the liquid.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:26.530
And, I can look at this and say,
because when I press from solid to

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:31.060
liquid, this tells me that the
density of the solid is lower than

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:35.590
the density of the liquid.
I look at that and I say ice cubes

00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:40.130
float. And, there are other systems
for which the same happens.

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:44.660
Here's silicon. Look at silicon.
Here's the phase diagram for

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:49.190
silicon: pressure versus temperature.
You see down here it's FCC,

00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:53.730
the diamond cubic structure, and if
we go, there is the melting

00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:57.810
point of silicon.
We go to the liquid: it's got more

00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:01.430
nearest neighbors.
How many nearest neighbors does the

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:05.060
solid have? It's sp3 hybridized.
It has four nearest neighbors.

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:08.680
Most liquids have about six nearest
neighbors. So,

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:12.300
when you have these open structures
like silicon, germanium,

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:15.930
the silicate glasses, and ice,
you actually go to a more condensed

00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:19.560
system when you first liquefy And
this is how you skate,

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:23.180
by the way. You know, you're down
here at 1 atmosphere about -5¡C and

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:27.070
you put your weight on the blades.
So that's a mass which then becomes

00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:31.230
a force on a small area which
becomes a pressure.

00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:35.380
And then that allows you to cross
this line. So,

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:39.530
you glide on a thin film of water.
And if the temperature gets really

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:43.690
cold, if it's down here at around
-20, and I've had the pleasure of

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:47.840
skating when it's -20,
my mass converted to appropriate

00:28:47.840 --> 00:29:07.680
pressure on the blades is not high
enough to cross this line.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:55.520
And, the skating experience is very
different because now it's just

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:59.050
steel blades on ice.
And, you don't get traction.

00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:02.580
To put it simply, you fall: not
good, not good.

00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:06.110
OK, so let's look at a few others.
If you contrast here, this is

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:09.640
aluminum, a simple FCC metal.
And what do we see with aluminum?

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:13.170
In this case, it's normal. Liquid
has about six to eight nearest

00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:16.700
neighbors, and the solid has 12
nearest neighbors.

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:20.230
So, the solid is denser than the
liquid, and you see that

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:24.150
in the phase diagram.
Here's nitrogen.

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:28.460
Nitrogen is, let's see,
what do we have? At 1 atmosphere

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:32.760
pressure, its melting point is 63
Kelvin. Its boiling point is 77

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:37.070
Kelvin. You can remember that
because MIT is 77 Mass.

00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:41.380
Ave. So, nitrogen boils at 77
Kelvin. And, the triple point is

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:45.690
down here. It's about a hundredth
of a degree below,

00:29:45.690 --> 00:30:05.580
and it turns out it's about an
eighth of an atmosphere pressure.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000
This is the triple point of nitrogen
ice in boiling liquid nitrogen.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000
But, this has a positive slope.
So, this means that the solid

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000
nitrogen ice sinks to the bottom of
the liquid nitrogen.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000
And I thought, since it's Friday,
maybe we could have just a little

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000
bit of fun here with the liquid
nitrogen. So,

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000
I'm going to get dressed.
I have to practice safe science.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000
I have to set an example for you.
This year, one of my staff said why

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:22.140
don't you wear a lab coat?
So, I said, OK.

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:26.420
I try to do this properly.
Which design house to go to for

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:30.710
this? Valentino,
Versace? So, what are we going to

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:34.990
do? We're going to get some
nitrogen. Let's get some nitrogen

00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:39.280
and have some fun.
So, we're going to be working at 77

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:43.570
Kelvin. And for those of you in the
back, I'm going to put this up on

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:47.850
the monitors. Oh,
no food in the laboratory.

00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:52.300
Let's put that over there.
OK, let's pour a little bit of this

00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:56.920
out. Fantastic.
OK, so, first thing we'll do is

00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:01.530
let's look at the glass transition
temperature. So,

00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:06.150
I have some rubber gloves.
So I have to face Craig over this

00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:10.760
way. OK Craig,
I'm going to do it this way.

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:15.380
So here's some rubber gloves.
And so, you can hear that they are

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:33.360
acting elastic. They
are above their TG.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000
So, this is just the covalent bonds.
And, what I'm going to do is pour a

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:10.000
little bit of nitrogen in here.
I don't know if you noticed, but

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000
these gloves are chiral,
just in case you noticed.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000
I chose chiral gloves. OK,
so now, so they are below the glass

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.000
transition temperature.
I'm sorry, Craig. Here,

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000
let me get that. We'll do it one
more time.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:53.810
Glass transition temperature,
also, if you wanted to drill the

00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:57.630
rubber stopper,
of course, now, you can hear,

00:31:57.630 --> 00:32:01.450
so you can hear that it's rubbery.
I'm going to drop it in there, let

00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:05.270
it mind its own business.
Oh, Saran wrap, it's also got glass

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:09.090
transition temperature.
So, we can show that, getting it

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:12.580
into liquid nitrogen.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:31.540
OK, so you hear how it's flexible?
So what we'll do is we'll put that

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:36.080
in there. OK,
now you can hear how it changes.

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:40.630
It's below the glass transition
temperature. I should have been

00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:45.180
wearing gloves and all that,
but forget it. How about protein?

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:49.720
Oh, you know, the other thing we
can do is I want to make

00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:53.550
some liquid oxygen.
So, I don't know,

00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:56.660
can we just cut to the computer
slide for a second?

00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:59.770
I want to show people what we're
going to do here with this next one.

00:32:59.770 --> 00:33:02.880
All right, so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to put a graduated

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:05.990
cylinder inside,
fill this with liquid nitrogen.

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:09.100
And these are the boiling points of
oxygen, argon,

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:12.210
and nitrogen. And,
nitrogen is at 77. So,

00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:15.330
this is all 77 Kelvin. But oxygen
condenses at 90.

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:18.440
So, we're going to make liquid
oxygen with a little

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:21.790
bit of argon ice.
I'm just going to let it sit there

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:25.390
for the balance of the lecture.
And maybe at the end, we will see

00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:45.180
some of the liquid oxygen.
So, let's just pour that.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:36.370
OK, so we'll let that work.

00:33:36.370 --> 00:33:41.120
And, oh yeah, how about proteins?
We said they were polymers. So,

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:45.870
let's see if we can do something
with the proteins here.

00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:50.620
Oh yeah, we're going to put the
roses in. They have glass flowers

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:56.330
at Harvard at the Fogg Museum.
We have glass flowers here at MIT.

00:33:56.330 --> 00:34:13.060
OK, so this is a rose. It's very
soft. OK, let's go.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:34:22.070
It's not a kitten.

00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:28.230
Come on. Maybe it only works on
roses. Maybe we should do one more.

00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:34.380
Be a scientist. You don't know.
Maybe it's just roses that do this.

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:40.530
So, let's look at this one. Glass
transition temperature: there it is.

00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:46.690
OK, so we've got that going. We'll
let the oxygen condense.

00:34:46.690 --> 00:34:52.840
And, let's see, let's go back to
the computer. I think we're going

00:34:52.840 --> 00:35:10.680
to take a break and go back to some
more learning here. Yeah.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:35:02.810
OK, hang on, there's one other one
here I think. All right,

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:06.630
so we've seen this one. Here's
nitrogen with all of its different

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:10.450
solid phases. Nitrogen actually has
different crystal structures.

00:35:10.450 --> 00:35:14.270
And so, this diagram shows what's
going on. As you change pressure at

00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:18.090
constant temperature,
here we are still down around -70

00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:37.113
Kelvin.
So, there we go from liquid to solid.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
It's HCP, and then it becomes
simple cubic, and then rhombic,

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
and so on. So, this property, that
certain elements have multiple

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000
different crystal structures,
is called polymorphism. So, these

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000
are called different polymorphs.
You've already heard that iron has,

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000
in some instances, BCC crystal
structure, and FCC crystal structure.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000
And, the phase diagrams will reveal
when these transitions occur.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000
Here's carbon dioxide: solid,
liquid, gas.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:54.570
It's got a positive slope.
What's interesting about carbon

00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:59.140
dioxide is, look here.
The 1 atmosphere isobar takes you

00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:03.710
directly from solid to gas.
So, it doesn't go liquid. And,

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:08.280
that gives it value as a refrigerant
because when it gives up its

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:12.850
enthalpy of transformation,
you don't end up with a liquid which

00:36:12.850 --> 00:36:17.420
can mess up your contents.
And so, this is often used in

00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:36.240
shipping certain materials.
So, we've got some here.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:26.280
Let's play it with some dry ice.
There's a great big ice cube here,

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:30.570
but there's some that's already
broken off, see?

00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:34.850
So, actually, OK,
so here we are. This is the big ice

00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:39.140
cube. I guess Craig is going to
want to see this.

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:43.420
So, let's let Craig and the people
watch the video.

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:47.710
This is what I call an ice cube.
OK, now, this is at -78¡C. And so,

00:36:47.710 --> 00:37:06.420
it can go directly, you are seeing
it sublime.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:56.390
Let's see, we can do something.
Just to prove, let's prove that

00:36:56.390 --> 00:37:00.790
it's going directly from solid to
gas. So, I have just some plain

00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:05.190
spring water here,
non-carbonated. This is flat.

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:09.590
OK, so this is flat, put that on
the edge there for Craig.

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:29.580
And then, just to show that we're
going directly, I'll take this --

00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:27.280
OK, see, I'll hold still,

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:35.850
Craig. So, there we go. You see
the bubbles coming off?

00:37:35.850 --> 00:37:44.420
Giant bubbles. So, we are making
CO2 in water. And,

00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:58.173
[LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE].
This is good.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:56.850
I want you to notice something.
You can buy this bottled water,

00:37:56.850 --> 00:38:00.710
and Craig I don't know if you can
catch this, but you see,

00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:04.560
they have these tiny wimpy bubbles.
We have big bubbles. So, that's

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:08.420
CO2. Let's see,
what else have we got going?

00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:12.280
Let's see if we still have some
liquid, we've made any liquid oxygen

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:16.140
yet. Oh yeah,
there's just a little bit.

00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:35.013
He won't be able to pick up on the
camera.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000
OK, so now, the last thing I want to
do is to go back to the computer

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000
image, if we could,
please. OK, so we've got carbon

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000
dioxide. All right,
here's a couple other phase diagrams.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000
Zirconia, I mentioned to you the
zirconia. This is just pure

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000
zirconia, ZrO2.
And, what do we find?

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.000
Cubic is the form that gives you
that faux diamond.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.000
But, look, it's stable only above
about 2000¡C. So,

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.000
if you're going to give your
sweetheart that faux diamond,

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:55.760
that's going to be too hot.
It's too hot. So,

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:59.290
what we're going to learn next day
is how to open up this range of

00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:02.820
stability the way we opened up the
range of liquid stability by adding

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:06.340
ethylene glycol to water,
and see if we can get cubic zirconia

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:09.870
stable down to room temperature.
Right, but normally it's monoclinic.

00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:13.400
Then it goes to tetragonal.
It goes cubic. It goes liquid,

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:16.930
and so on. Then it even goes vapor.
Here's carbon. At room temperature

00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:20.460
over a wide range of pressure is
graphite: hexagonal close packed.

00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:39.986
Then, at elevated pressure, it
becomes diamond.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:28.130
And, here's liquid carbon.
It turns out that by judicious

00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:32.260
choice of chemistry,
people at General Electric about 30

00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:36.390
years ago reasoned that steel
consists of carbon in iron.

00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:40.530
And, if we quench steel, we end up
with carbon in the iron lattice.

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:44.660
If we put too much carbon, the
carbon will exolve as precipitates.

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:48.790
Well, if we could exolve at
elevated pressure,

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:52.930
could we get the carbon to exolve
not as graphite but diamond cubic?

00:39:52.930 --> 00:39:56.920
And they did it.
They generated artificial diamonds.

00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:00.760
And, one of the leaders of the team
was a course three alum from MIT

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:04.610
whom I met years later on a
committee in Washington in

00:40:04.610 --> 00:40:08.460
connection with the aluminum
industry. And he told me,

00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:12.300
he was in the team that went to
London to negotiate with De Beers,

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:16.150
the big South African diamond
concern. They were scared because

00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:36.700
General Electric reported that they
could make artificial diamonds.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:23.570
And, General Electric had reported
that they could make large,

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:27.150
artificial diamonds. Well, large,
they were trying to make diamond

00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:30.730
dust. They actually had one that
was about 1 millimeter.

00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:34.310
It was tiny, but De Beers was
nervous. And,

00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:37.890
the fellow's name was Rod [Hanneman?
. He told me the thing that scared

00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:41.460
him most was not sitting down with
De Beers, because he had them

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:45.040
bluffed. The hardest thing was
getting through British customs

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:48.620
because he had this on his person.
Now, if he opens up and they see

00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:52.200
all of this diamond material,
remember, artificial diamonds don't

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:55.470
exist yet.
So, he's going to tell the customs

00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:58.410
agent, well, these are artificial
diamonds. I don't think that's

00:40:58.410 --> 00:41:01.360
going to work.
So, there's always,

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:04.310
what is it, the early bird gets the
worm, but it's the second mouse gets

00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:07.260
the cheese. So,
you can be too early sometimes with

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:10.200
that stuff. OK,
here's bismuth. Here's bismuth.

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:13.150
Bismuth has a lot of phases. Look
at all the different phases of

00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:16.100
bismuth. And,
look at here. What does this tell

00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:19.050
you about the solid bismuth?
It will float in liquid bismuth.

00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:40.166
And then, if you go to high enough
in pressure, it compresses.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:26.280
Here's sulfur.
The sulfur is really one confused

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:30.570
element. Look at all the solid
phases. Look at all the liquid

00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:34.850
phases. Sulfur is one mess.
Look at: so, it has allotropes.

00:41:34.850 --> 00:41:39.140
Allotropes are different bonding
forms. For example,

00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:43.420
oxygen can exist as atomic oxygen,
the molecular oxygen, O2, and O3,

00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:47.710
which is ozone.
So, we say that O2 and O3 are both

00:41:47.710 --> 00:42:06.886
allotropes of oxygen.
Well, sulfur has 16 allotropes.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000
It exists as discrete,
atoms, as the dimer, this hexamer;

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000
the common solid form is this eight
member circular linkage.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000
And then, it polymerizes in the
melt. So, here's the low

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000
temperature. Room temperature
sulfur is rhombic.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.000
And, at elevated temperature,
it goes monoclinic. It's a

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000
solid-solid phase transformation.
That's what you're seeing in that

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000
phase diagram when you
look back here.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:23.870
That's what all this is.
There's a monoclinic, and then the

00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:27.740
rhombic. All right,
and then if you melt it,

00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:31.620
at first it gives the straw colored
liquid, which they call lambda,

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:35.490
at 119¡. And, around 160, this
turns into, the rings start to open

00:42:35.490 --> 00:42:39.370
up and it turns an orange color at
160. And then,

00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:43.240
this is at some elevated temperature
of about 200¡C.

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:47.120
They poured this long polymer
sulfur goo into water,

00:42:47.120 --> 00:43:05.706
quenching it, and guess what you
form?

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:54.470
You form a glass.
It's plastic sulfur.

00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:57.940
So, all this is happening as a
result of the different phases that

00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:01.410
are present. So,
this is forming plastic sulfur.

00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:04.890
The last thing I want to tell you
about is this last phase,

00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:08.360
supercritical fluid, which is a very
high temperature,

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:11.840
high-pressure phase where you can't
tell a gas from a liquid.

00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:15.310
You can think of it as a highly
compressed gas,

00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:18.780
or a highly rarefied liquid.
The bonds get far enough apart that

00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:22.260
the liquid is behaving a little bit
differently. The solvation

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:25.780
properties are those of a liquid.
But here's what happens in the

00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:29.350
supercritical fluid.
You have transport properties of a

00:43:29.350 --> 00:43:32.920
gas. So, you have something that's
liquid-like in terms of its ability

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:36.490
to solvate things,
but it has gas-like diffusivity,

00:43:36.490 --> 00:43:40.060
gas-like viscosity. And, this is
very, very much in the research

00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:43.640
agenda these days,
using supercritical fluids to attack

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:47.210
things like toxic waste and so on
without having to resort to very

00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:50.630
aggressive solvents.
There's no sense going after

00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:53.890
aggressive toxins when you have to
use aggressive organic solvents.

00:43:53.890 --> 00:43:57.150
But this will give you something of
low polarity dissolving nonpolar

00:43:57.150 --> 00:44:00.410
things. And, here's one that you
use more often that you know:

00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:03.670
decaffeinating coffee.
Use a solvent extraction.

00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:06.940
When I was your age, they actually
used this stuff called methylene

00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:10.200
chloride. I subsequently used it in
stripping paint.

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:13.470
It's very vicious.
You see, the trick in

00:44:13.470 --> 00:44:16.730
decaffeinating coffee is to get the
caffeine out but not to brew the

00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:36.660
coffee. You want to selectively
get the caffeine.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:24.090
So, the use supercritical carbon
dioxide. So, carbon dioxide leaches

00:44:24.090 --> 00:44:28.180
out the caffeine but doesn't touch
the coffee. So,

00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:32.270
you get up into that temperature
pressure regime,

00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:36.360
leach out the caffeine,
and then you change temperature and

00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:40.450
pressure. And now you have this
pregnant liquor that is exceeding

00:44:40.450 --> 00:44:44.540
the solubility product.
And, now you exolve the caffeine.

00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:48.630
And then, you reflux the CO2. And,
that's how we go about with the

00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:52.720
coffee. The last thing I want to do
before introduce,

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:56.810
someone's going to tell you about
some other activities that will

00:44:56.810 --> 00:45:00.900
happen during IAP is to tell you
about, I guess this lesson is that

00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:20.266
there are no limits to the depths of
human stupidity.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:45:08.600
This will tie in denaturing of
protein from last day.

00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:12.200
This is a news thing. Dick
Kromminga, a principal at Silverton

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:15.800
High School, said,
this is in Silverton,

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:19.400
OR. And I'm not making this up,
said a pep rally stunt that burned

00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:38.200
four students won't
ever be repeated.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:26.750
The four suffered severe burns on
their buttocks from sitting on

00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:46.200
blocks of dry ice.
The girls were chosen by their

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:34.250
classmates for a stunt to see who
could sit on the ice the longest.

00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:54.566
The dry ice, or solid carbon
dioxide, can be as cold as 112¡F

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:41.750
below zero. The four were treated
at Silverton Hospital.

00:45:41.750 --> 00:46:01.866
Dr. Frank Lord said some of the
girls may need skin grafts.

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:49.250
They have denatured the proteins.
This is a quote: the truth is I've

00:45:49.250 --> 00:46:08.966
never seen any frostbite on this
part of the anatomy.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.500
Anyways, it goes on about how this
was tied in with some football

00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:40.766
homecoming and somebody just
didn't pay attention.
