[Norvig] My answer is I think these first 2 are both quite good.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Either of them would work just fine.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The set one I think would work great for a regular deck of cards with 52 cards,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but it might not work well if you had wild cards

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
or if you were playing with a big shoe of 2 decks.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Then you might have 2 of the exact same card,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and then a set can't represent that.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
This string has all the information, and so you could deal with that,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
but at some point you're going to want to break this string up into 5 individual cards.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It's just easier to have that done right from the start

00:00:34.000 --> 09:59:59.000
rather than have to do the operation on it.
