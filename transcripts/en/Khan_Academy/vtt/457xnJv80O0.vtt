00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.010
In this video, we're going to
look at pairs of molecules and

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.910
see if they relate to each other
in any obvious way or

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.820
maybe less than obvious way.

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.840
So these first two right here,
they actually look like a

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.260
completely different
molecules.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.110
So your gut impulse might
be to say that these are

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.840
completely different
molecules.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.870
And it wouldn't be completely
off, but we look a little bit

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.890
closer, you see that this guy
on the left has one, two,

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.000
three, four carbons, and so does
this guy on the right.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.010
It has one, two, three,
four carbons.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.400
This guy on the left
has two, four, six,

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.400
seven, eight hydrogens.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.080
This guy on the right has two,
four, six, eight hydrogens.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.680
And they both have one oxygen.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.030
So both of the molecular
formulas for both of these

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.310
things are four carbons, eight
hydrogens, and one oxygen.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.510
They're both C4H8O.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.200
So they have the same
molecular formula.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.650
They're made up of the same
thing, so these are going to

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.380
be isomers.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.740
They're going to be isomers,
and they're a

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.460
special type of isomers.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.550
In this situation, we don't
have the same bonds.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.570
We're made up of the same
things, but the bonds, what is

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.360
connected to what
is different.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.190
So we call this a constitutional
isomer.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.900
So we are essentially made up of
the same things, but we are

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.200
actually two different molecule,
actually, two very

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.650
different molecules here.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.180
Now let's look at this
next guy over here.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.600
So if we look at this molecule,
it does look like

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.820
this carbon is chiral.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.970
It is an asymmetric carbon.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.820
It is bonded to four different
groups: fluorine, bromine,

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.090
hydrogen, and then
a methyl group.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.740
And so's this one.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.200
And they're both made up
of the same things.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.450
You have the carbon-- and not
only are they made up of the

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.440
same things, but the bonding
is the same.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.740
So carbon to a fluorine, carbon
to a fluorine, carbon

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.730
to a bromine, carbon to a
bromine, carbon to hydrogen in

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.610
both of then carbon to the
methyl group in both.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.020
But they don't look
quite the same.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.260
Are they mirror images?

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.560
Well, no.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.440
This guy's mirror image would
have the fluorine popping out

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.920
here, the hydrogen going back
here, and then would have the

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.930
bromine pointing out here.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.600
Let's see if I can somehow get
from this guy to that guy.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.270
Let me flip this guy first. So
let me-- a good thing to do

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:30.520
would be to just flip to see
the fastest way I could

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.340
potentially get there.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.400
Let me just flip it like this.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.700
So I'm going to flip out of
the page, you can imagine.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.660
I'm going to flip
it like this.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.870
So I'm going to take this methyl
group and then put it

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:42.810
on the right-hand side.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.430
And you can imagine, I'm going
to turn it so it would come

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.770
out of the page and
then go back down.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.950
So if I did that, what
would it look like?

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.130
I would have the carbon,
this carbon here.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.080
I would have the methyl group
on that side now.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.590
And then since I flipped it
over, the bromine was in the

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.520
plane of the page.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.910
It'll still be in the plane of
the page, but since I flipped

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.060
it over, the hydrogen, which was
in the back, will now be

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.740
in the front.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.940
The hydrogen will now be in
the front and the fluorine

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.620
will now be in back because
I flipped it over.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.320
So the fluorine is
now in the back.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.870
Now, how does this
compare to that?

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.570
Let's see if I can somehow
get there.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.610
Well, if I take this fluorine
and I rotate it to where the

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.300
hydrogen is, and I take the
hydrogen and rotate it to

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.550
where-- that's all going to
happen at once-- to where the

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.720
bromine is, and I take the
bromine and rotate it to where

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.530
the fluorine is, I get that.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.860
So I can flip it and then I can
rotate it around this bond

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.550
axis right there, and I would
get to that molecule there.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.040
So even though they look pretty
different, with the

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.410
flip and a rotation, you
actually see that these are

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:49.660
the same a molecule.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.590
Next one.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.050
So let's see, what
do we have here?

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.060
Let me switch colors.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.820
So over here, this part
of both of these

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:03.960
molecules look the same.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.380
You have the carbons
on both of them.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.570
This carbon looks like
a chiral center.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.380
It's bonded to one, two,
three different groups.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.470
You might say, oh, it's two
carbons, but this is a methyl

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.829
group, and then this side has
all this business over it, so

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.700
this is definitely
a chiral carbon.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.829
And over, here same thing.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.500
It's a chiral carbon.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.620
And this has the same thing.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.290
It's bonded to four
different things.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.940
So each of these molecules has
two chiral carbons, and it

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.470
looks like they're made
up of the same things.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.250
And not only are they made up
of the same things, but the

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.090
bonds are made in
the same way.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.830
So this carbon is bonded to a
hydrogen and a fluorine, and

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.760
the two other carbons,
same thing, a

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.530
hydrogen and a fluorine.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.890
Carbon, it looks like
it's a hydrogen.

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.310
It's bonded to a hydrogen and a
chlorine, so it's made up of

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.350
the same constituents
and they're

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.410
bonded in the same way.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.630
So these look like--
but the bonding is

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:01.820
a little bit different.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.960
Over here on this one on the
left, the hydrogen goes in the

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.510
back, and over here, the
hydrogen's in the front.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.310
And over here, the chlorine's
in back, and over here, the

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.560
chlorine's in front.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.290
So these look like
sterioisomers.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.630
You saw earlier in this video,
you saw structural isomers,

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.290
made up of the same
things but the

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:24.690
connections are all different.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.920
Stereoisomers, they're made
up of the same thing, the

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.380
connections are the same, but
the three-dimensional

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.800
configuration is a little
bit different.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.060
For example, here on this
carbon, it's connected to the

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.810
same things as this carbon, but
over here, the fluorine's

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.750
out front, and over here--
out here, the

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:41.400
fluorine's out front.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.100
Over here, the fluorine's
backwards.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.540
And same thing for the
chlorine here.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.570
It's back here and
it's front here.

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:52.770
Now, let's see if they're
related in a more nuanced way.

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.780
You could imagine putting
a mirror behind.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.470
I guess the best way to
visualize it, imagine putting

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.130
a mirror behind this molecule.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.940
If you put a mirror behind this
molecule, what would its

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.570
reflection look like?

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.940
So if you put a mirror behind
it, in the image of the

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.470
mirror, this hydrogen would now,
since the mirror's behind

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.750
this whole molecule, this
hydrogen is actually closer to

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:13.450
the mirror.

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.307
So then the mirror image, you
would have a hydrogen that's

00:06:16.307 --> 00:06:19.530
pointed out, and then you would
have the carbon, and

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.770
then you would have the fluorine
being further away.

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.930
And same thing in the
mirror image here.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.680
You would have the chlorine
coming closer since this

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.270
chlorine is further back, closer
to the mirror, and then

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.230
you would have the hydrogen
pointing outwards like that.

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:36.290
And then, obviously, the rest
of the molecule would look

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.790
exactly the same.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:42.180
And so this mirror image that I
just thought about in white

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.710
is exactly what this molecule
is: hydrogen pointing out in

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:49.800
front, hydrogen pointing
out in front.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.110
You might say, wait, this
hydrogen is on the right, this

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.710
one's on the left.

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:54.090
It doesn't matter.

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:55.690
This is actually saying that
the hydrogen's pointing out

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:58.040
front, the fluorine is pointing
out back, hydrogen up

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.010
front, fluorine back, chlorine
out front, hydrogen back,

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:03.930
chlorine out front,
hydrogen back.

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:06.930
So these are actually mirror
images, but they're not the

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:08.900
easy mirror images that we've
done in the past where the

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.750
mirror was just like that
in between the two.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.260
This one is a mirror image where
you place the mirror

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.300
either on top of or behind
one of the molecules.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.570
So this is a class of
stereoisomers, and we've

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.130
brought up this word before.

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:23.380
We call this enantiomers.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.030
So if each of these are an
enantiomers, I'll say they are

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:30.830
enantiomers of each other.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:32.390
They're steroisomers.

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:35.380
They're made up of the same
molecules, so that they have

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:36.680
the same constituents.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.120
They also have the same
connections, and not only do

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.090
they have the same connections,
that so far gets

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:45.100
us a steroisomer, but they are a
special kind of stereoisomer

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.450
called an enantiomer, where they
are actual mirror images

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:50.500
of each other.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.200
Now, what is this one
over here in blue?

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.330
Just like the last one, it looks
like it's made up of the

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:57.540
same things.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:00.140
You have these carbons, these
carbons, these carbons and

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:01.020
hydrogens up there.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.590
Same thing over there.

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.120
You have a hydrogen, bromine,
hydrogen and a bromine,

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.100
hydrogen, chlorine, hydrogen,
chlorine, hydrogen, chlorine,

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.210
hydrogen, chlorine.

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:10.500
So it's made up of
the same things.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.010
They're connected in the same
way, so they're definitely

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:15.780
stereoisomers.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:17.510
Well, we have to make sure
they're not-- well, let's make

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:19.830
sure they're not the same
molecule first. Here,

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:21.520
hydrogen's in the front.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.770
There, hydrogen's in the back.

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.600
Here, hydrogen is in the back.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.590
Here, hydrogen is
in the front.

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:28.140
So they're not the
same molecule.

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.360
They have a different
three-dimensional

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.940
configuration, although their
bond connections are the same,

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:35.190
so these are stereoisomers.

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:46.350
Let's see if they're
enantiomers.

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:49.410
So if we look at it like this,
you put a mirror here, you

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:50.720
wouldn't get this
guy over here.

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.770
Then you would have a chlorine
out front and a hydrogen.

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:55.140
So you won't get it if you
get a mirror over there.

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.450
But if we do the same exercise
that we did in the last pair,

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:02.855
if you put a mirror behind this
guy, and I'm just going

00:09:02.855 --> 00:09:05.170
to focus on the stuff that's
just forward and back, because

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:07.160
that's what's relevant
if the mirror is

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.250
sitting behind the molecule.

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:12.570
So if the mirror's sitting
behind the molecule, this

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:15.810
bromine is actually closer to
the mirror than that hydrogen.

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:20.680
So the bromine will now be out
front and then the hydrogen

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:21.380
will be in back.

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:22.930
This hydrogen will
be in the back.

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:26.120
I'm trying to do kind of a
mirror image if it's hard to

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.070
conceptualize.

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:29.870
And then that would
all look the same.

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:33.890
And then this chlorine will
now be out front, and this

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:37.725
hydrogen will now be in the back
in our mirror image, if

00:09:37.725 --> 00:09:39.180
you can visualize it.

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:40.350
And then we have another one.

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:43.230
And this chlorine is closer to
the mirror that it's kind of

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:44.940
been sitting on top of.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.100
So in the mirror image, it would
be pointing out, and

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.690
then this hydrogen would
be pointing back.

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:52.550
Now let's see, is our mirror
image the same as this?

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.940
So the mirror image, our bromine
is pointing in the

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.140
front, hydrogen in
the back there.

00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:00.690
Then we have hydrogen in-- then
in our mirror image, we

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:02.270
have the hydrogen in back,
chlorine in front.

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:02.770
Same there.

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:05.460
So far, it's looking like
a mirror image.

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:08.690
And then in this last carbon
over here, chlorine in front,

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:10.310
hydrogen in back.

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:12.800
But here, we have chlorine in
the back, hydrogen in front.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.750
So this part, you could
think of it this way.

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:20.360
This is the mirror image of
this, this is the mirror image

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.470
of this part, but this is not
the mirror image of that part.

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:27.790
So when you have a stereoisomer
that is not a

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:29.980
mirror, when you have two
stereoisomers that aren't

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:34.330
mirror images of each other,
we call them diastereomers.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:35.580
I always have trouble
saying that.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:36.920
Let me write it.

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:45.990
These are diastereomers, which
is essentially saying it's a

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:48.240
stereoisomer that is
not an enantiomer.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.470
That's all it means: a
stereoisomer, not an

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:51.090
enantiomer.

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:52.830
A stereoisomer's either going
to be an enantiomer or a

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:54.960
diastereomer.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.040
Now, let's do this last one.

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:02.650
Let's see we have two-- we have
this cyclohexane ring,

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:05.950
and they have a bromo on the
number one and the number two

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:07.750
group, depending how
you think about it.

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:11.510
It looks like they are mirror
images of each other.

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:15.050
We could put a mirror right
there, and they definitely

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:16.640
look like mirror images.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.520
And this is a chiral
carbon here.

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.790
It's bonded to one carbon group
that is different than

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:21.550
this carbon group.

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:23.170
This carbon group
has a bromine.

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:24.080
This carbon group doesn't.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.750
It just has a bunch of hydrogens
on it, if you kind

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:27.210
of go in that direction.

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:30.640
And it's hydrogen and then a
bromine, so that is chiral.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.370
And then, same argument,
that is also chiral.

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:36.050
And obviously, this one is
chiral and that is chiral.

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:38.880
But if you think about it, they
are mirror images of each

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.370
other, and they each have
two chiral centers

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:44.350
or two chiral carbons.

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:46.840
But if you think about it, all
you have to do is flip this

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.830
guy over and you will
get this molecule.

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:51.970
These are the same molecules.

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:56.380
So it is the same molecule.

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:59.050
So this is interesting, and we
saw this when we first learned

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:00.220
about chirality.

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.350
Even though we have two chiral
centers, this is

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:04.650
not a chiral molecule.

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:06.690
It is the same thing as
its mirror image.

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:10.180
It is superimposable on
its mirror image.

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:23.410
It is superimposable on
its mirror image.

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:27.540
So even though it has chiral
carbons in it, it is not a

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.380
chiral molecule.

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:31.530
And we call these
meso compounds.

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:36.510
And we can point to one of them
because they really are

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:37.660
the same compound.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:41.590
This is a meso compound.

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:43.770
It has chiral centers.

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:45.960
It has chiral carbons, I
guess you could say it.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.360
But it is not a chiral
compound.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.350
And the way to spot these fairly
straightforward is that

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:52.500
you have chiral centers,
but there is a

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.170
line of symmetry here.

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:56.110
There's a line of symmetry
right here.

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:59.690
These two sides of the compound
are mirror images of

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:00.430
each other.

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:05.190
Now, these would not be the same
molecule if I change that

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:09.310
to a fluorine and I change
that to a fluorine.

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:11.780
Then all of a sudden, you do
not have this symmetry.

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:14.180
These are mirror images,
but they would not be

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:15.060
superimposable.

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.650
So if that was a fluorine,
these would actually be

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:18.790
enantiomers.

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:22.110
And this would not be only one
meso compound, it would be two

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:27.860
different enantiomers, and one
of them would have an R

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:30.340
direction and one of them would
have an S direction if

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:33.040
we go with the naming
conventions that we learned.
