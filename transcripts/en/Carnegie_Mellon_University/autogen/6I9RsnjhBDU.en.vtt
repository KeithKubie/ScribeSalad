00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:29.460
then going to throw down the gauntlet to
 

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:30.590
then going to throw down the gauntlet to
you and ask you to answer the first

from mouse up to human and particularly

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:37.860
from mouse up to human and particularly
 

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:40.100
from mouse up to human and particularly
the human connectome project and the

there's been as many people in the

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:43.800
there's been as many people in the
 

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.500
there's been as many people in the
audience and I know our panelists are

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:45.510
audience and I know our panelists are
 

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:47.600
audience and I know our panelists are
where a lot of public critiques of some

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:47.610
where a lot of public critiques of some
 

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:49.010
where a lot of public critiques of some
of these mapping efforts but the

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:49.020
of these mapping efforts but the
 

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:50.890
of these mapping efforts but the
question of how valuable they'll be and

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:50.900
question of how valuable they'll be and
 

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.780
question of how valuable they'll be and
I wanted to hear your thoughts and some

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:53.790
I wanted to hear your thoughts and some
 

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:55.850
I wanted to hear your thoughts and some
of the panelists lots about how useful

00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:55.860
of the panelists lots about how useful
 

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:58.250
of the panelists lots about how useful
is it to map a system I remember quote

00:18:58.250 --> 00:18:58.260
is it to map a system I remember quote
 

00:18:58.260 --> 00:18:59.330
is it to map a system I remember quote
many years ago actually from

00:18:59.330 --> 00:18:59.340
many years ago actually from
 

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:00.950
many years ago actually from

understood world doesn't really get you
 

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:05.690
understood world doesn't really get you
very far and so the question is how will

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:05.700
very far and so the question is how will
 

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:07.370
very far and so the question is how will
this be useful and how do we leverage it

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:07.380
this be useful and how do we leverage it
 

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:08.840
this be useful and how do we leverage it

into the kinds of theory that Marling's
 

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:11.710
into the kinds of theory that Marling's
talking about yeah it's really a

talking about yeah it's really a
 

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:16.790
talking about yeah it's really a
terrific question the one of my

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:16.800
terrific question the one of my

agree with that on the other hand to

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:48.210
agree with that on the other hand to
 

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:50.420
agree with that on the other hand to
take a really simple system like the

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:50.430
take a really simple system like the
 

00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:54.050

human genome which we spent a lot of

00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:54.060
human genome which we spent a lot of
 

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:57.200
human genome which we spent a lot of
time and energy mapping I think what we

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:57.210
time and energy mapping I think what we
 

00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:58.550
time and energy mapping I think what we
learned from that were two things one

00:19:58.550 --> 00:19:58.560
learned from that were two things one
 

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.050

was at the end of the human genome

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:00.060
was at the end of the human genome
 

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:05.480
was at the end of the human genome
project we realized that the information

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:05.490
project we realized that the information
 

00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:08.780
project we realized that the information
was going to come from from variation

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:08.790
was going to come from from variation
 

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:11.840
was going to come from from variation
not from the reference sequence that was

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:11.850
not from the reference sequence that was
 

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:14.480
not from the reference sequence that was
published in 2003 that was really

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:14.490
published in 2003 that was really
 

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:15.920
published in 2003 that was really
wonderful if you wanted to know how

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:15.930
wonderful if you wanted to know how
 

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:18.530
wonderful if you wanted to know how
humans were different from mice are

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:18.540

flies not so helpful if you wanted to

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:21.420
flies not so helpful if you wanted to
 

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:22.850
flies not so helpful if you wanted to
understand what any of these three

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:22.860
understand what any of these three
 

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:25.880
understand what any of these three
billion bases actually did and for that

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:25.890
billion bases actually did and for that
 

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:28.700
billion bases actually did and for that
you needed to look at the three million

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:28.710
you needed to look at the three million
 

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:30.410
you needed to look at the three million
points of variation and how they played

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:30.420
points of variation and how they played
 

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:32.030
points of variation and how they played
out and you had to learn a lot more

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:32.040
out and you had to learn a lot more
 

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:34.280
out and you had to learn a lot more
about the actual structure so mapping

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:34.290
about the actual structure so mapping
 

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:36.290
about the actual structure so mapping
didn't get you very far on the other

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:36.300
didn't get you very far on the other
 

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:40.970
didn't get you very far on the other
hand that process and that project had

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:40.980
hand that process and that project had
 

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:44.420
hand that process and that project had
so many spin-offs and again it was a lot

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:44.430
so many spin-offs and again it was a lot
 

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:45.290
so many spin-offs and again it was a lot
of that was around technology

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:45.300
of that was around technology
 

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.750
of that was around technology
development and so it was through that

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760
development and so it was through that
 

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:51.110
development and so it was through that
project of mapping that we developed the

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120
project of mapping that we developed the
 

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:54.230
project of mapping that we developed the
sequencing technologies that have I

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240
sequencing technologies that have I
 

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.380
sequencing technologies that have I
think really been the basis for almost

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:57.390
think really been the basis for almost
 

00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:59.870
think really been the basis for almost
all of the major discoveries in biology

00:20:59.870 --> 00:20:59.880
all of the major discoveries in biology
 

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:02.180
all of the major discoveries in biology
over the last five to eight years so

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:02.190
over the last five to eight years so
 

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:05.020
over the last five to eight years so
there's something to be said for

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:05.030
there's something to be said for
 

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:08.330
there's something to be said for
embarking on these big mapping projects

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:08.340
embarking on these big mapping projects
 

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:11.330
embarking on these big mapping projects
even if the reference map you get at the

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:11.340
even if the reference map you get at the
 

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:14.250
even if the reference map you get at the
end is almost the

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:14.260
end is almost the
 

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:16.710
end is almost the
Roxy it's almost just a way to get to

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:16.720
Roxy it's almost just a way to get to
 

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.060
Roxy it's almost just a way to get to
lots of other things that you can't

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:18.070
lots of other things that you can't
 

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:20.850
lots of other things that you can't
predict I should note that was brain

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:20.860
predict I should note that was brain
 

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:22.320
predict I should note that was brain

absolutely it's a linear project and we
 

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:30.120
absolutely it's a linear project and we
knew what the endgame was a word you

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:30.130
knew what the endgame was a word you
 

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:32.660
knew what the endgame was a word you
know we're going after something that is

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:32.670
know we're going after something that is
 

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:35.820
know we're going after something that is
at least you know who knows two three

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:35.830
at least you know who knows two three
 

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:37.410
at least you know who knows two three

understand yeah I would say I agree with

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:41.800
understand yeah I would say I agree with

understand yeah I would say I agree with
that in general the map is going to

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:44.170
that in general the map is going to
 

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:48.330
that in general the map is going to
reveal information that's good and solid

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:48.340
reveal information that's good and solid
 

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:50.880
reveal information that's good and solid
information to riff upon to build upon

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:50.890
information to riff upon to build upon
 

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:53.490
information to riff upon to build upon
and without that it's very difficult to

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:53.500
and without that it's very difficult to
 

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:55.800
and without that it's very difficult to

on if you look at this question from the

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:30.100
on if you look at this question from the
 

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:33.720
on if you look at this question from the
perspective if you assume that we would

304 neurons or whatever every one of
 

00:25:55.309 --> 00:25:57.609
304 neurons or whatever every one of
them has a name and identified and those

00:25:57.609 --> 00:25:57.619
them has a name and identified and those
 

00:25:57.619 --> 00:25:59.019

are animals that are able to do

00:25:59.019 --> 00:25:59.029
are animals that are able to do
 

00:25:59.029 --> 00:26:03.159
are animals that are able to do
extraordinarily complicated behaviors

00:26:03.159 --> 00:26:03.169
extraordinarily complicated behaviors
 

00:26:03.169 --> 00:26:04.960
extraordinarily complicated behaviors
really if you think about what they able

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:04.970
really if you think about what they able
 

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:07.960
really if you think about what they able
to produce so the rules by which that

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:07.970
to produce so the rules by which that
 

00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:09.609
to produce so the rules by which that
happens are really interesting the flip

00:26:09.609 --> 00:26:09.619
happens are really interesting the flip
 

00:26:09.619 --> 00:26:14.259
happens are really interesting the flip
side of this is in trying to get the

00:26:14.259 --> 00:26:14.269
side of this is in trying to get the
 

00:26:14.269 --> 00:26:16.539
side of this is in trying to get the
parts list for a human we don't know if

00:26:16.539 --> 00:26:16.549
parts list for a human we don't know if
 

00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:19.509
parts list for a human we don't know if
there are human specific neurons do we

00:26:19.509 --> 00:26:19.519
there are human specific neurons do we
 

00:26:19.519 --> 00:26:21.570
there are human specific neurons do we
have different parts than any other

00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:21.580
have different parts than any other
 

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:24.729
have different parts than any other
mammal than any other species and those

00:26:24.729 --> 00:26:24.739
mammal than any other species and those
 

00:26:24.739 --> 00:26:26.619
mammal than any other species and those
are questions that really do beg for an

00:26:26.619 --> 00:26:26.629
are questions that really do beg for an
 

00:26:26.629 --> 00:26:28.839
are questions that really do beg for an
answer which we should find of pin down

00:26:28.839 --> 00:26:28.849
answer which we should find of pin down
 

00:26:28.849 --> 00:26:31.180
answer which we should find of pin down
in some way so I think there is the need

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:31.190
in some way so I think there is the need
 

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:32.769
in some way so I think there is the need
for that kind of mapping and just

00:26:32.769 --> 00:26:32.779
for that kind of mapping and just
 

00:26:32.779 --> 00:26:35.349
for that kind of mapping and just
getting the fundamentals done ooh anyone

00:26:35.349 --> 00:26:35.359
getting the fundamentals done ooh anyone
 

00:26:35.359 --> 00:26:37.749
getting the fundamentals done ooh anyone
else like to anything Theo maybe if I

could Adam not that indeed that the
 

00:26:40.519 --> 00:26:42.339
could Adam not that indeed that the
effort for mapping is kind of a

00:26:42.339 --> 00:26:42.349
effort for mapping is kind of a
 

00:26:42.349 --> 00:26:44.560
effort for mapping is kind of a
bottom-up approach from the fundamentals

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:44.570
bottom-up approach from the fundamentals
 

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:47.619
bottom-up approach from the fundamentals
to understand all the intricacies of the

00:26:47.619 --> 00:26:47.629
to understand all the intricacies of the
 

00:26:47.629 --> 00:26:51.070
to understand all the intricacies of the
nervous system and the brain but also we

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:51.080
nervous system and the brain but also we
 

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:55.690
nervous system and the brain but also we
can learn by looking at top-down

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:55.700
can learn by looking at top-down
 

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.969
can learn by looking at top-down
approaches so by looking at existing

00:26:57.969 --> 00:26:57.979
approaches so by looking at existing
 

00:26:57.979 --> 00:27:00.969
approaches so by looking at existing
diseases and look for example the

00:27:00.969 --> 00:27:00.979
diseases and look for example the
 

00:27:00.979 --> 00:27:06.279
diseases and look for example the
effects of connectivity variations let's

00:27:06.279 --> 00:27:06.289
effects of connectivity variations let's
 

00:27:06.289 --> 00:27:09.039
effects of connectivity variations let's
say in Alzheimer's or epilepsy by using

00:27:09.039 --> 00:27:09.049
say in Alzheimer's or epilepsy by using
 

00:27:09.049 --> 00:27:10.839
say in Alzheimer's or epilepsy by using
surrogate measures that tell us

00:27:10.839 --> 00:27:10.849
surrogate measures that tell us
 

00:27:10.849 --> 00:27:12.089
surrogate measures that tell us
something about the lictor

00:27:12.089 --> 00:27:12.099
something about the lictor
 

00:27:12.099 --> 00:27:14.649
something about the lictor
electrophysiology or the biochemistry

00:27:14.649 --> 00:27:14.659
electrophysiology or the biochemistry
 

00:27:14.659 --> 00:27:17.710
electrophysiology or the biochemistry
and through that maybe we can push that

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:17.720
and through that maybe we can push that
 

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.690
and through that maybe we can push that
information back to the fundamental to

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:19.700
information back to the fundamental to
 

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:22.259
information back to the fundamental to
corroborate the evidence and make it

00:27:22.259 --> 00:27:22.269
corroborate the evidence and make it
 

00:27:22.269 --> 00:27:27.489
corroborate the evidence and make it
stronger terrific anything else ok so is

00:27:27.489 --> 00:27:27.499
stronger terrific anything else ok so is
 

00:27:27.499 --> 00:27:29.440
stronger terrific anything else ok so is

learn more about the brain and this will
 

00:27:55.309 --> 00:27:57.700
learn more about the brain and this will
help solve some of these problems but

00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:57.710
help solve some of these problems but
 

00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:59.080

don't know how to do that yet but we're
going to figure out how to do that and

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:03.620
going to figure out how to do that and
 

00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:07.180
going to figure out how to do that and
it's obvious that possibly maybe at the

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:07.190
it's obvious that possibly maybe at the
 

00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:08.560
it's obvious that possibly maybe at the
circuit level or at the molecular level

chemical imbalance problems these are
problems of neural circuits so you can

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:05.870
problems of neural circuits so you can
 

00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:07.030

space so it does require a completely
 

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:51.100

new view of the problem and a completely

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:51.110
new view of the problem and a completely
 

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:53.710
new view of the problem and a completely
new approach and actually i think it's a

00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:53.720

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:57.250

data we need the statisticians to help

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:42.170
data we need the statisticians to help
 

00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:45.160
data we need the statisticians to help
us with that meta-analysis of the

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:45.170
us with that meta-analysis of the
 

00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:47.250
us with that meta-analysis of the
information to help us with

00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:47.260
information to help us with
 

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:49.480
information to help us with
standardizing the way we collect and we

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:49.490
standardizing the way we collect and we
 

00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:52.210
standardizing the way we collect and we
store the data and we prepare it for

00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:52.220
store the data and we prepare it for
 

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:54.870
store the data and we prepare it for
analysis and as an example one of the

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:54.880
analysis and as an example one of the
 

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:57.780
analysis and as an example one of the
alumni of Carnegie Mellon is were

00:33:57.780 --> 00:33:57.790
alumni of Carnegie Mellon is were
 

00:33:57.790 --> 00:34:00.280
alumni of Carnegie Mellon is were
working at Warwick Tom Nichols and he

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:00.290
working at Warwick Tom Nichols and he
 

00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:01.630
working at Warwick Tom Nichols and he
has been working in the statistics

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:01.640
has been working in the statistics
 

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:04.690
has been working in the statistics
department and his effort is to develop

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:04.700
department and his effort is to develop
 

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:09.150
department and his effort is to develop
a set of tools for supporting Madonna

00:34:09.150 --> 00:34:09.160
a set of tools for supporting Madonna
 

00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:11.980
a set of tools for supporting Madonna
meta-analysis functional MRI data for

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:11.990
meta-analysis functional MRI data for
 

00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:16.840
meta-analysis functional MRI data for
neuroscience projects and and that tries

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:16.850
neuroscience projects and and that tries
 

00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:18.790
neuroscience projects and and that tries
to avoid the problems of pulling data

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:18.800
to avoid the problems of pulling data
 

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:21.640
to avoid the problems of pulling data
that is incompatible and that creates

00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:21.650
that is incompatible and that creates
 

00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:24.370
that is incompatible and that creates
biases in the final results I think that

00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:24.380
biases in the final results I think that
 

00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:25.390
biases in the final results I think that
is very important

00:34:25.390 --> 00:34:25.400
is very important
 

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:29.920
is very important
and I can see immediately were the kind

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:29.930
and I can see immediately were the kind
 

00:34:29.930 --> 00:34:32.110
and I can see immediately were the kind
of initiative brings us together to

00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:32.120
of initiative brings us together to
 

00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:35.620
of initiative brings us together to
solve this kind of problems we have been

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:35.630
solve this kind of problems we have been
 

00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:37.690
solve this kind of problems we have been
trying to do things yeah well I was

00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:37.700
trying to do things yeah well I was
 

00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:41.230
trying to do things yeah well I was
going to you are Arab but they're

00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:41.240
going to you are Arab but they're
 

00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:45.100
going to you are Arab but they're
probably another way of another

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:45.110
probably another way of another
 

00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:49.630

point on that in his talk we have pic we

00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:11.090
point on that in his talk we have pic we
 

00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:14.770
point on that in his talk we have pic we
have a lot of say clinical specimens and

00:35:14.770 --> 00:35:14.780
have a lot of say clinical specimens and
 

00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:16.570
have a lot of say clinical specimens and
we have a lot of clinical information

00:35:16.570 --> 00:35:16.580
we have a lot of clinical information
 

00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:19.780
we have a lot of clinical information
and large volume of patients and we can

00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:19.790
and large volume of patients and we can
 

00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:23.290
and large volume of patients and we can
definitely but we sometimes a lot of

00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:23.300
definitely but we sometimes a lot of
 

00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:27.430
definitely but we sometimes a lot of
times we don't know what to look at and

00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:27.440
times we don't know what to look at and
 

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:29.470
times we don't know what to look at and
what kind of data we want to get from

00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:29.480
what kind of data we want to get from
 

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:33.330
what kind of data we want to get from
those you can get genetics or genome

00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:33.340
those you can get genetics or genome
 

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:36.490
those you can get genetics or genome
sequencing proteomics and maybe a lot of

00:35:36.490 --> 00:35:36.500
sequencing proteomics and maybe a lot of
 

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:40.600
sequencing proteomics and maybe a lot of
other things but i think we if we

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:40.610
other things but i think we if we
 

00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:42.580
other things but i think we if we
understand what kind of tools are ahead

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:42.590
understand what kind of tools are ahead
 

00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:45.490
understand what kind of tools are ahead
of us and what what those tools can lead

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:45.500
of us and what what those tools can lead
 

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:48.730
of us and what what those tools can lead
us to then we can start thinking better

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:48.740
us to then we can start thinking better
 

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:52.300
us to then we can start thinking better
or more efficiently about what really we

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:52.310
or more efficiently about what really we
 

00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:56.950
or more efficiently about what really we
should look at from our are what we have

00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960
should look at from our are what we have
 

00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:00.400
should look at from our are what we have
in the clinic any in biology so this is

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:00.410
in the clinic any in biology so this is
 

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:03.430
in the clinic any in biology so this is
how I think it is important speaking of

00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:03.440
how I think it is important speaking of
 

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:06.970
how I think it is important speaking of
the Houthis brain initiative and

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:06.980
the Houthis brain initiative and
 

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:09.790
the Houthis brain initiative and
research can impact on what we're going

00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:09.800
research can impact on what we're going
 

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:14.140
research can impact on what we're going
to have thank you anyone else awesome

00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:14.150
to have thank you anyone else awesome
 

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:16.270
to have thank you anyone else awesome
you know it raises this interesting

00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:16.280
you know it raises this interesting
 

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:17.950
you know it raises this interesting
question about being data starved

00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:17.960
question about being data starved
 

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:20.260
question about being data starved
because I think that one of the things

00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:20.270
because I think that one of the things
 

00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:23.350
because I think that one of the things
that has held neuroscience back is

00:36:23.350 --> 00:36:23.360
that has held neuroscience back is
 

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:28.900
that has held neuroscience back is
actually that the it's so difficult to

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:28.910
actually that the it's so difficult to
 

00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:30.220
actually that the it's so difficult to
collect the data that you really are

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:30.230
collect the data that you really are
 

00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:32.650
collect the data that you really are
focused on a very specific hypothesis at

00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:32.660
focused on a very specific hypothesis at
 

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:35.260
focused on a very specific hypothesis at
all times and once we break this barrier

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:35.270
all times and once we break this barrier
 

00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:36.220
all times and once we break this barrier
of

00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:36.230
of
 

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:39.359
of
having enough data it will enable us to

00:36:39.359 --> 00:36:39.369
having enough data it will enable us to
 

00:36:39.369 --> 00:36:42.250
having enough data it will enable us to
collect and analyze data in an unbiased

00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:42.260
collect and analyze data in an unbiased
 

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:45.040
collect and analyze data in an unbiased
way not in this one part of the brain or

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:45.050
way not in this one part of the brain or
 

00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:48.400
way not in this one part of the brain or
for this one cell but across the entire

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:48.410
for this one cell but across the entire
 

00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:49.720
for this one cell but across the entire
spectrum of brain function and also

00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:49.730
spectrum of brain function and also
 

00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:53.230
spectrum of brain function and also
behavior and and I think then one of the

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:53.240
behavior and and I think then one of the
 

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:55.000
behavior and and I think then one of the
big challenges will be developing

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:55.010
big challenges will be developing
 

00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:57.880
big challenges will be developing
statistical methods and being able to

00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:57.890
statistical methods and being able to
 

00:36:57.890 --> 00:37:00.160
statistical methods and being able to
extract meaningful parts of that data to

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:00.170
extract meaningful parts of that data to
 

00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:03.880
extract meaningful parts of that data to
link it then back to disease phenotype

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:03.890
link it then back to disease phenotype
 

00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:08.410
link it then back to disease phenotype
or a treatment path and and that's very

00:37:08.410 --> 00:37:08.420
or a treatment path and and that's very
 

00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:09.460
or a treatment path and and that's very
difficult right because if you can

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:09.470
difficult right because if you can
 

00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:11.920
difficult right because if you can
analyze every different part of the

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:11.930
analyze every different part of the
 

00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:14.200
analyze every different part of the
brain or every different behavioral

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:14.210
brain or every different behavioral
 

00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:17.010
brain or every different behavioral
phenotype you can't just do a series of

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:17.020
phenotype you can't just do a series of
 

00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:19.510
phenotype you can't just do a series of
t-tests to extract meaning you need an

00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:19.520
t-tests to extract meaning you need an
 

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:22.270
t-tests to extract meaning you need an
enormous data sample you need many many

00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:22.280
enormous data sample you need many many
 

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:24.430
enormous data sample you need many many
individuals and I agree this sort of

00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:24.440
individuals and I agree this sort of
 

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:26.020
