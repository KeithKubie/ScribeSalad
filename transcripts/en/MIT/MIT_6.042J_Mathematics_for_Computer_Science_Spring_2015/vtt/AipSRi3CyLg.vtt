00:00:00.854 --> 00:00:01.710
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.760
So we come to the idea
of countable sets, which

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.130
are the most familiar
kind of infinite sets.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.130
And a countable set is one where
you can list the elements-- a0,

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:13.910
a1, a2 and so on.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.430
So there's a list of
all of the elements of A

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.920
in which every element in
A appears at some point.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.835
You can count up to
any given element of A,

00:00:23.835 --> 00:00:26.900
and every element of A you
will eventually get to,

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.590
you'll be able to
count up to it.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.470
So it's just a
matter of listing it.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.980
And the technical definition
of "A is countable"

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.650
is if there's a
bijection between A

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:37.910
and the non-negative integers.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.100
Because this listing,
in effect, really

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.490
is a mapping from the
non-negative integers to A. 0

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.600
is a0, 1 maps to
a1, 2 maps to a2,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.830
and implicitly there's a
bijection being indicated here.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.060
That's assuming that all of the
[? a's ?] are distinct for it

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.310
to be a bijection.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.420
So we also have,
as a special case,

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.000
the finite sets are also
considered to be countable.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.365
So really, if n is
a bijection to A,

00:01:04.365 --> 00:01:06.550
then A is called
countably infinite.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.730
The other possibility
is that A is finite.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.959
And the two together, I
just say A is countable.

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:14.500
So what we've just
figured out, then,

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.010
from the previous examples,
is that the positive integers

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.040
are countable.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.650
And all the integers
are countable,

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.527
because in both cases
we exhibited bijections

00:01:23.527 --> 00:01:24.735
to the non-negative integers.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.140
Another important
and not very hard

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.580
example is the set of
finite binary words.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.520
So we use this notation,
"0, 1 star," meaning

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.190
all the finite-- star means
all the finite sequences

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.940
of these elements, 0 and 1.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.910
So this is just the
finite binary words.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:43.870
How are they countable?

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.890
Well, I need a way to be able to
list them in some orderly way.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.750
Well, let's just
do it by length.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.770
Let's begin by listing
the empty word, or string,

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:52.840
of length zero.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.930
And then I'm going to list
all the one-bit strings,

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.162
the strings of length one.

00:01:58.162 --> 00:01:59.310
And there are two of those.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.252
So let the second element,
the next element of the list

00:02:03.252 --> 00:02:05.710
after the empty string, be 0,
and then let the next element

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.150
after that be 1.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.130
Then let's list all
the length two strings.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.090
Well, there's four length
two binary strings.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.290
And let's just list them
in some sensible order--

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.420
say, by their binary
representation.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.410
And then keep going.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.560
List all the length
three binary strings--

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.560
there's eight of those.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.850
And finally, keep going up
until you get to the length n

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.190
binary strings, of which
there are 2 to the n.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.120
And this is a description of a
way to list, one after another,

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.080
all of the finite binary words,
or finite binary strings.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.710
And that listing is
implicitly a description

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.320
of a bijection from the
non-negative integers

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.830
n to the nth element
in my listing.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.620
And that's a bijection, so the
binary words are countable.

00:02:57.515 --> 00:02:59.370
Another example
of a countable set

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.150
is the pairs of
non-negative integers.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.420
So how can-- now I've got
the non-negative integers.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.477
I've got to find a bijection of
pairs of non-negative integers.

00:03:08.477 --> 00:03:09.560
How am I going to do that?

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.440
Well, it's the same idea as
we used with binary strings.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.940
There's a bunch of
ways to prove it,

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.650
but let's just propagate
the binary string idea.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.850
Let's start listing the pairs
of non-negative integers.

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:28.380
And after 0, 0, I'm going to
list two pairs-- 0, 1 and 1, 0.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.306
And after them, I'm going to
list three pairs-- 0, 2, 2, 0,

00:03:32.306 --> 00:03:33.870
and 1, 1.

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.050
And after them, 0,
3, 3, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.690
And if you can see
what I'm doing,

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.790
I'm basically listing the
pairs in the order of the sum

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:44.940
of their coordinates.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.060
So the nth block of pairs
that I'm going to list

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.680
will be the pairs the sum of
whose two coordinates is n.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.210
There'll be n plus one of those.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:57.460
And I keep going in this way.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.120
This is a nice orderly
description of--

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.780
or a description of
a nice orderly way

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.580
to list all of the pairs
of non-negative integers.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.720
Within a block, invent
some alphabetical rule

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.210
for listing the pairs.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.060
So I'm going to--
I've hinted at a rule

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.375
here for listing the finite
set of pairs whose sum is n,

00:04:17.375 --> 00:04:19.940
and you can invent--
any one will do.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.390
So that tells us that
we have a bijection

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.500
between the
non-negative integers

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.180
and the pairs of
non-negative integers.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.420
So that's another
important bijection.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.420
Now, when you're trying
to prove countability,

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.640
it's very useful to have
the following lemma, which

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.181
gives an alternative
characterization

00:04:38.181 --> 00:04:41.750
of countability-- namely,
a set A is countable if

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.520
and only if you can
list A allowing repeats.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.050
Remember, our
original definition

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.930
is that you can list A without
repeats if it's infinite,

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.290
or else it's finite.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.340
So that was-- the bijection
between the non-negative

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.060
integers and A, in
effect, is saying

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.510
that that's a listing of
all of an infinite set A

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.440
with no repeats, because it's
a bijection we're mapping.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.880
If an element
appeared twice, we'd

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.627
have two different
non-negative integers

00:05:07.627 --> 00:05:09.960
mapping to it, which would
break the bijection property,

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.930
the injection property.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.370
And so suppose we allow repeats.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.020
And the claim is that that's
fine, because you can fix that.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.810
So the lemma says
that, if there's

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.770
a surjective function from the
non-negative integers to A,

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.480
then A is countable.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.180
Well, let's just check
quickly in one direction.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.470
If A is finite, then there's
clearly a surjective function

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.270
from the non-negative
integers to A.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.390
There's lots of extra
non-negative integers

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:39.720
you don't need.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.450
If it's a finite set,
like 10 elements in A,

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.500
map 0 through 9 to
those 10 elements,

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.530
and map every other
non-negative integer, say,

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:52.650
to 10th element, or
last element, of A.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.270
So there's certainly a
surjection if A is finite.

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.250
Now, suppose that A is infinite,
and I have a surjection

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.600
from the non-negative
integers to A.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.272
So I'm listing A with repeats.

00:06:03.272 --> 00:06:05.530
And I'm supposed to
have a bijection if it

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:06.789
matches the other definition.

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:07.580
How do you do that?

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.550
Well, if you're a
computer scientist,

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.310
you know how to change
a sequence with repeats

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:13.980
into a sequence without repeats.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.780
You just filter
it for duplicates,

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.370
going from left to right.

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.030
Take this infinite
sequence of elements of A

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.100
in which there are repeats, and
keep only the first occurrence

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.920
of each element.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.880
That will define a bijection
with the non-negative integers

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.320
if a is infinite.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.750
And that's how we prove this
lemma, which I'm just going

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.460
to settle for talking through.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.420
So now we have
another convenient way

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.590
to show that a set is
countable, just by describing,

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:41.690
not a bijection,
but a surjection

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.260
between the non-negative
integers in A. Surjections

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.140
are often easier to describe
than bijections, which

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.960
is why this is a useful lemma.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.230
A corollary of this
is that, if I'm

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.280
trying to show that
a set A is countable,

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.190
all that I really need to
do is find some other set

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:59.860
that I know to be
countable and describe

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.150
a surjection from
that other set C to A.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:07.602
Because I know that
if C is countable,

00:07:07.602 --> 00:07:09.810
then there'll be a bijection
between the non-negative

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:13.520
integers and C. And
since when you combine

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.700
a bijection with a surjection,
you wind up with a surjection,

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.520
that will implicitly
define a surjection

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:23.890
from the non-negative integers
to A, which by the lemma

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:25.450
tells me that A is countable.

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:27.080
So the general way
to prove something

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.960
is countable is just
describe a surjection,

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.770
from something you
know to be countable,

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:33.350
that hits your target.

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:36.160
And let's look at
an example of that.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.030
I claim that the
rationals are countable,

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:39.488
the rational numbers
are countable.

00:07:39.488 --> 00:07:43.620
Well, this is kind of a little
bit more striking at first,

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.840
because you can see
how you can count

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:49.590
the non-negative integers,
the positive integers, all

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:51.660
the integers, because
there's a nice sensible way

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:52.940
to have one come after other.

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:55.020
But with the
rationals, it's messy.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:58.110
In between any two rationals,
there's another rational.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:59.540
There isn't any first rational.

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.350
There isn't any obvious
way to list them all.

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:06.170
But really, if you stop thinking
about the rationals of how they

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:10.900
are laid out on the real line,
but just think of them as pairs

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:14.200
of integers, then it becomes
clear how to list them,

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.880
because we already know that the
pairs of non-negative integers

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:18.680
are countable.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.680
So I'm just going to map a pair
of non-negative integers m, n

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.860
to the rational
number m divided by n.

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:27.610
Well, n might be
zero, so if n is zero,

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:31.220
just map all of those pairs to
your favorite rational number.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.049
Call it a half.

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:38.200
And that gives us a
nice surjective mapping,

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.630
because every
rational number can

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:41.546
be expressed as m
over n-- at least

00:08:41.546 --> 00:08:43.130
every non-negative
rational number.

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:45.970
So in effect, what we
have is a surjection

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:47.990
from the pairs of
non-negative integers, which

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:52.340
we know is countable, onto the
non-negative real numbers--

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:55.830
sorry, the non-negative rational
numbers, quotients of integers.

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:57.850
Which means that the
rationals, sure enough,

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:01.170
are countable, even
though they seem to be

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:04.180
spread out all over the line.

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:08.410
So, again, we saw that if
N cross N is countable,

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:10.200
and there's a surj,
described above,

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.810
to the non
non-negative rationals,

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:15.580
so they're countable.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:18.580
Well, just looking
ahead a little bit,

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:20.360
it's going to turn
out that, in contrast

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:24.500
to the rational numbers, the
real numbers are not countable.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.230
And in fact, neither
are the infinite binary

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:30.760
sequences that we
saw-- there was

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.900
a bijection between the
infinite binary sequences

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.716
and the power set of the
non-negative integers.

00:09:36.716 --> 00:09:38.090
And both of these
are going to be

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:40.670
basic examples of
uncountable sets,

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:43.030
so sets that are not
countable, which we will be

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:46.260
examining in the next lecture.
