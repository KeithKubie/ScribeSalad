00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.450
(muffled crowd chattering)

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.080
- Good morning, I hope
you're having an amazing day.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.970
It's Mark Wiens, I'm in Mexico City.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.740
(traffic rumbling)
Before coming to Mexico City,

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.690
I got an email from Moises,
and he watches our videos,

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.180
he loves to eat, and he said,

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.640
"When you come to Mexico
City, I wanna take you around,

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.370
"I wanna show you some
amazing Mexican street food."

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:20.840
So I'm on my way to go meet Moises now.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.250
He's gonna take us on a Mexican

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.760
street food tour of Mexico City,

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.810
especially focusing on
the center of Mexico City.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.728
We're gonna visit some
of the legendary markets.

00:00:29.728 --> 00:00:32.680
But first, we are gonna go eat breakfast

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.280
at this stall which is in La Condesa,

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.780
that is known for, well,
OK, I'm gonna show you.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.930
We're on our way there now.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.654
This is gonna be an awesome
day of Mexican street food.

00:00:42.654 --> 00:00:45.737
(energetic drumbeat)

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.540
- [Man] Not Moises, but he's
waiting for you over there.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.947
- (laughing) OK, cool.
- Nice to meet you.

00:00:50.947 --> 00:00:52.630
- Nice to meet you.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.140
Moises, what's up man?
- Nice to met you.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.610
- Nice to meet you.
- How are you?

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.170
Torta de chilaquil.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.000
Maybe we can say it's
a chilaquil sandwich.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.030
Green and red.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.863
These are my friends.

00:01:04.863 --> 00:01:05.696
- Hello.
- Hey.

00:01:05.696 --> 00:01:06.728
- Nice to meet you.

00:01:06.728 --> 00:01:08.450
- Ignacio, and Julia.
- Hola, nice to meet you.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.549
(woman speaking foreign language)

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:13.030
(man speaking foreign language)

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.250
- [Mark] And a torta is, it's a sandwich,

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.200
and so they start with a loaf of bread.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.947
I think they fill in frijoles?
- [Man] Frijoles.

00:01:18.947 --> 00:01:21.380
- So beans, and then they have all

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.057
the ingredients laid out here.

00:01:23.057 --> 00:01:25.254
- Chicken, and then you have to choose

00:01:25.254 --> 00:01:29.274
between the green chilaquiles
and the red chilaquiles.

00:01:29.274 --> 00:01:32.561
- [Mark] OK, and that includes cheese?

00:01:32.561 --> 00:01:33.620
- [Moises] Uh huh, and cream.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.070
- [Mark] And cream, and
what's in the chilaquile?

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.190
Is it chips?
- It's tortilla with salsa.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.921
- Fried tortilla.
- Fried tortilla, OK.

00:01:39.921 --> 00:01:41.407
- Fried tortilla with salsa.

00:01:41.407 --> 00:01:42.240
- It's like crunchy, but then it

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.415
turns kinda saucy with all the salsa.

00:01:44.415 --> 00:01:45.871
- [Moises] Yeah, exactly.

00:01:45.871 --> 00:01:49.106
(people speaking foreign language)

00:01:49.106 --> 00:01:49.939
(traffic rumbling)

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:51.798
(person whistles)

00:01:51.798 --> 00:01:54.598
(car honking)

00:01:54.598 --> 00:01:56.103
(woman speaking foreign language)

00:01:56.103 --> 00:01:57.290
- Grab your--
- Ah, my tortas.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.235
- Tortas.
(talking over each other)

00:02:00.235 --> 00:02:02.392
(Julia speaking foreign language)

00:02:02.392 --> 00:02:03.830
(man speaking foreign language)

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.014
- I like more green.
- That I agree.

00:02:06.014 --> 00:02:08.710
- Green...
- I also like more green.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.220
- I think maybe 80% of
people like the green.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.490
- Like the green? Oh, OK.

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.410
OK, so green is one of their top sellers.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.800
- Yeah, exactly.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.620
- Yeah, they told us that they were done

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.100
with the green ones for
today like ten minutes ago.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.600
- Wow, already, and it's only 9am.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.993
- [Man] Yeah. (laughs)

00:02:23.993 --> 00:02:26.134
(birds chirping)
(truck honking)

00:02:26.134 --> 00:02:27.991
(traffic rumbling)

00:02:27.991 --> 00:02:29.642
- [Moises] Really, really good.

00:02:29.642 --> 00:02:30.650
(Julia speaking foreign language)

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.386
- [Julia] Si, this is green.

00:02:32.386 --> 00:02:33.708
(men chattering)

00:02:33.708 --> 00:02:34.541
- [Mark] Gracias.
(Julia laughs)

00:02:34.541 --> 00:02:36.440
On the inside is actually a milanesa,

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.660
which is a fried breaded
piece of very thin chicken,

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.840
and then they put in
some beans at the bottom,

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.506
they put in some cream, she adds in the,

00:02:45.506 --> 00:02:47.270
you can see those are actually like

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.160
fried tortilla chips which are kinda

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.810
crushed up and then added with the sauce,

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.075
the green chile, to make it kinda saucy.

00:02:56.075 --> 00:02:59.158
(energetic drumbeat)

00:03:02.112 --> 00:03:04.515
Mmm, oh.

00:03:04.515 --> 00:03:08.170
The bread is crusty, but
like really fluffy, soft.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.410
You've got that thin
layer of fried chicken.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.050
You can taste the green
chile in there for sure.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.810
And then it has like kind
of a, I mean the chips,

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.360
they're not crunchy
anymore, but that creates

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.210
kind of like a tortilla sauce,

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.210
which just explodes with flavor in there.

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.260
You've got the creamy taste of the cheese,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.599
yeah, that's very good.

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:27.730
What do you think?

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.037
- I think it's awesome.
- Pretty good.

00:03:30.037 --> 00:03:32.230
- And I think your
review was very accurate.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.530
- [Man] My favorite part is

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.330
the chicken mixed with the sauce.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:36.687
- Oh, yeah.
- Awesome.

00:03:36.687 --> 00:03:39.770
(energetic drumbeat)

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.930
- Yeah, this is not a
light morning breakfast.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.450
It's heavy, it's dense.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.130
You've got carbs on top of carbs

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.080
on top of carbs, and it is delicious.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.236
I'm really starting to get
into the depths of this torta.

00:04:00.236 --> 00:04:03.800
And it's just, that
green chile is awesome.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.000
And look, more and more
people are arriving.

00:04:07.144 --> 00:04:08.757
Moises was telling me that if you come

00:04:08.757 --> 00:04:13.223
at about 11am today, the
line will go down the street.

00:04:13.223 --> 00:04:14.760
So perfect timing.

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.500
This was an amazing way to start the day.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.570
And we're on our way next
to Mercado de San Juan,

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.159
which is a very well-known
downtown market.

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:26.671
(people speaking foreign language)

00:04:26.671 --> 00:04:30.730
(relaxed cumbia music)

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.370
Wow, that line, as we are leaving,

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.090
it's stretching into the park now.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.154
We just arrived to Mercado de San Juan.

00:04:44.154 --> 00:04:47.680
This is known as a gourmet
market in Mexico City,

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.510
and already there's a
lot of exotic fruits.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.293
This is a really cool market
that I wanted to visit.

00:04:52.293 --> 00:04:53.650
- (speaking foreign language) cherries.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.300
- Cherry?

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.825
I'll try.

00:04:56.825 --> 00:04:57.658
Gracias.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.610
Look at the size of those.

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.710
Wow, look at the size of those!

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.320
This market is known as being

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.200
a high-end, very gourmet market.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.963
You walk around, you see cheeses,

00:05:08.963 --> 00:05:11.600
they have all sorts of different meats

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.480
imported from around the world,

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.000
but it's a very nice
market, it's very clean,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.412
it's very organized, and yeah,

00:05:19.412 --> 00:05:22.868
they have some very
high-end gourmet foods here.

00:05:22.868 --> 00:05:24.754
(woman speaking foreign language)

00:05:24.754 --> 00:05:26.247
(sizzling)

00:05:26.247 --> 00:05:27.226
(woman laughs)

00:05:27.226 --> 00:05:28.900
We've stopped at a stall
that serves all sorts

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.900
of prehispanic and exotic
bugs and creepy crawlers.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.540
(man speaking foreign language)

00:05:47.942 --> 00:05:48.939
- [Mark] OK.

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:50.552
(crowds chattering)

00:05:50.552 --> 00:05:53.125
(relaxed cumbia music)

00:05:53.125 --> 00:05:57.292
(woman speaking foreign language)

00:06:01.238 --> 00:06:02.071
Esta bueno.

00:06:02.071 --> 00:06:03.951
It has a strong flavor.

00:06:03.951 --> 00:06:05.088
(woman laughs)
It's good.

00:06:05.088 --> 00:06:06.890
(crowds chattering)

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.430
- [Mark] He just freshly
fried up some scorpions.

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.860
They're not too huge,
they're little scorpions.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.247
He said eat the scorpion,
chase it with the mezcal.

00:06:15.247 --> 00:06:18.497
(relaxed cumbia music)

00:06:20.411 --> 00:06:22.160
Oh wow, it's kinda juicy.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.914
Oh!

00:06:25.914 --> 00:06:30.600
It almost has like a nutty, kinda like

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.462
slight chocolatey flavor to it,

00:06:32.462 --> 00:06:34.680
with a little bit of a bitterness.

00:06:37.863 --> 00:06:40.200
That's a good combination.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.380
That was a tasty scorpion.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.462
You still alive?
- Yeah. (laughing)

00:06:43.462 --> 00:06:46.712
(relaxed cumbia music)

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.310
- This market is fantastic.

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.041
You'll find so many exotic things.

00:06:53.041 --> 00:06:55.540
But some of the stalls are not that open,

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.425
because it's a Sunday morning right now.

00:06:57.425 --> 00:07:00.327
I'm glad we got to try a scorpion.

00:07:00.327 --> 00:07:04.160
But we're gonna proceed
onwards to La Merced,

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.520
which is one of the ultimate markets

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.140
of downtown Mexico City,
and there we're gonna

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.857
do some serious street food eating.

00:07:11.857 --> 00:07:14.940
(energetic drumbeat)

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.890
We just arrived to Mercado de La Merced.

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:26.980
This is one of the most
well-known markets in Mexico City.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.120
It's huge, and just
riding here in the car,

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.030
you can see the energy starts to pick up,

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:32.360
it's getting busier and busier,

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.230
there's stall after stall of just

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:36.338
everything you can possibly imagine.

00:07:36.338 --> 00:07:39.980
(crowds chattering)

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.750
This is just a gargantuan market,

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:43.771
so this entire area is all market.

00:07:43.771 --> 00:07:45.750
We are on a hunt for street food though,

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.740
but we're passing through everything

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:52.643
from batteries and wallets
to plants to kids' toys

00:07:52.643 --> 00:07:57.280
(clacking and squeaking)
to little jumping dogs.

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:02.600
Passing through a passageway,
a canyon of shoes.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.629
We are arriving to the food
section, or one food section.

00:08:05.629 --> 00:08:07.931
(crowds chattering)

00:08:07.931 --> 00:08:10.878
(woman speaking foreign language)

00:08:10.878 --> 00:08:15.077
(man speaking foreign language)

00:08:15.077 --> 00:08:16.540
(clacking)
- Si.

00:08:18.035 --> 00:08:20.375
(woman speaking foreign language)

00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:24.951
(man speaking foreign language)

00:08:24.951 --> 00:08:27.283
(clacking)

00:08:27.283 --> 00:08:29.533
(clacking)

00:08:31.256 --> 00:08:33.540
(sizzling)

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:35.660
- We're stopping first
to eat some quesadillas,

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:38.240
flattening the masa,
and then they're frying

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.670
over the hot plate, they're filling it

00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:41.640
with some kind of a meat mixture,

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.490
and then they fold them
up, roll them up, and then,

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:48.720
wow, look at that basket full of candy.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.750
And then they fry over here,

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:53.150
and it's almost like a wok-looking

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:56.000
rounded hot skillet as well.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.167
They smell unbelievable.

00:08:58.167 --> 00:09:01.167
(crowds chattering)

00:09:03.112 --> 00:09:06.040
- A chicharron quesadilla.
- Chicharron quesadilla.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.550
Awesome.
- So this is made out of pork.

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:09.860
- [Mark] OK, and there's
chicharron in there?

00:09:10.696 --> 00:09:13.479
- [Man] Well, it's a
different kind of chicharron.

00:09:13.479 --> 00:09:18.180
- So it's not the pork skin,
it also has meat parts.

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.810
- [Mark] OK, and there's
cheese in there also?

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:21.460
- No, no cheese.
- No cheese.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.380
- No cheese?
(talking over each other)

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:25.502
- Then just the salsa roja?
- Yeah, exactly.

00:09:25.502 --> 00:09:30.419
- OK.
(crowds chattering)

00:09:30.419 --> 00:09:32.002
- Hmm.

00:09:32.002 --> 00:09:35.176
Mm! (laughing)

00:09:35.176 --> 00:09:37.860
It's extremely good, extremely good.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.670
The tortilla is fresh made
here, and the salsa roja,

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:46.240
red salsa, is very good, extremely good.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.500
- Look at all that meat
stuffed in there and the salsa.

00:09:49.538 --> 00:09:52.631
(crowds chattering)

00:09:52.631 --> 00:09:54.836
(chuckling) Oh.

00:09:54.836 --> 00:09:58.122
Oh that's awesome.

00:09:58.122 --> 00:10:01.280
Oh, oh, that's ridiculous.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.170
That meat is like so
fatty, oily and salty.

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:07.140
And then, oh, that salsa is awesome,

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:08.680
and then you can really taste

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.300
the freshness of that tortilla.

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:11.710
They grill it over those hot plates

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:13.704
so that it sort of gets crispy.

00:10:13.704 --> 00:10:15.121
Oh that's superb.

00:10:16.428 --> 00:10:17.900
Oh wow.
- Look at that.

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:19.940
- So this one is cheese--
- Cheese quesadilla.

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:21.870
The thing, here in Mexico City,

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.118
not all quesadillas are
with cheese. (laughs)

00:10:24.118 --> 00:10:26.364
This one specifically is with cheese.

00:10:26.364 --> 00:10:27.308
- [Mark] Very interesting.

00:10:27.308 --> 00:10:29.295
- Yeah, but the cheese
quesadilla with green salsa.

00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:34.295
(crowds chattering)
(laughing)

00:10:34.432 --> 00:10:35.901
- [Mark] Stringy cheese?

00:10:35.901 --> 00:10:37.329
- Esta bueno?
- The best.

00:10:37.329 --> 00:10:39.020
- OK and next up, this is
the only one with cheese,

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.611
and it's also with salsa
verde, the green salsa.

00:10:41.611 --> 00:10:44.861
(relaxed cumbia music)

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:49.206
Yep.

00:10:49.206 --> 00:10:50.410
Oh, really good.

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:52.529
Yeah, that's like a
mozarella-tasting cheese.

00:10:52.529 --> 00:10:54.815
(man speaking foreign language)

00:10:54.815 --> 00:10:56.790
(woman laughs)
- With green salsa.

00:10:56.790 --> 00:11:01.790
And beef, onions, and tomato sauce.

00:11:02.015 --> 00:11:04.703
(crowds chattering)

00:11:04.703 --> 00:11:05.671
(dishes clinking)

00:11:05.671 --> 00:11:07.471
(laughing)

00:11:07.471 --> 00:11:09.420
Oh, that's amazing, yeah.

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:10.880
It's almost like a barbecue sauce.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.670
And again those tortillas
are just awesome.

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:15.406
And I love how they fry
them, like double fry them,

00:11:15.406 --> 00:11:17.240
so that they get kinda crispy.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.233
So good.

00:11:19.233 --> 00:11:20.380
Which one is the best?

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:21.437
- Chicharron.
- Chicharron by far.

00:11:21.437 --> 00:11:22.340
- Chicharron.
- I didn't have any!

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:26.020
- I agree, that chicharron
was unparalleled.

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:28.570
Muy, muy bueno.
- Gracias.

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:30.140
- It was absolutely amazing.

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:31.140
OK, we're movin' on.

00:11:31.981 --> 00:11:34.113
(crowds chattering)

00:11:34.113 --> 00:11:35.794
(sizzling)

00:11:35.794 --> 00:11:39.540
(man speaking foreign language)

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.480
There's so much meat in the air.

00:11:42.617 --> 00:11:45.034
- Tacos, tacos, tacos, tacos.

00:11:45.987 --> 00:11:47.614
- [Man] We need salsa.

00:11:47.614 --> 00:11:48.750
(sizzling)

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.102
(chopping)

00:11:50.102 --> 00:11:53.102
(crowds chattering)

00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:00.883
(man speaking foreign language)

00:12:00.883 --> 00:12:02.206
- [Mark] Gracias.

00:12:02.206 --> 00:12:04.272
- [Man] So there's green,
there's red, and there's--

00:12:04.272 --> 00:12:05.569
(talking over each other)

00:12:05.569 --> 00:12:06.402
(man speaking foreign language)

00:12:06.402 --> 00:12:07.783
- [Mark] Whichever one is very spicy.

00:12:07.783 --> 00:12:08.833
- With, or with...

00:12:08.833 --> 00:12:10.584
- [Man] (speaking foreign
language) 'cause we had

00:12:10.584 --> 00:12:12.636
red on this one, so the green.

00:12:12.636 --> 00:12:14.690
- [Mark] OK, we can try both.

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:16.497
(speaking foreign language)

00:12:16.497 --> 00:12:19.497
(crowds chattering)

00:12:21.646 --> 00:12:23.940
- Salted beef, they also in this taco have

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:27.849
French fries, nopales, and onion.

00:12:27.849 --> 00:12:28.730
(laughs) That's a plus.

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:31.939
- The deal breaker here, the game changer,

00:12:31.939 --> 00:12:35.290
is that they add on a whole
handful of French fries.

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:36.650
That's like a whole pack of French fries

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:37.820
on top of your taco.

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:41.220
You've gotta really like
squish it down to get this all.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.499
Look at, it's just
overflowing with French fries.

00:12:44.499 --> 00:12:45.800
(relaxed cumbia music)

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.415
Cheers.
- Cheers, man.

00:12:47.415 --> 00:12:50.082
(Moises laughs)

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:54.833
- Oh, wow.

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:57.250
Oh, that's amazing.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:01.640
Oh, the salsa in there,
then you've got those oily,

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:06.570
crispy French fries, the beef,
it's salty, oh it's awesome.

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:09.980
- [Man] They add texture,
right, the French fries?

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:10.970
- Look at all that.

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:12.520
OK, now I gotta try this onion.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.360
(crowds chattering)

00:13:17.996 --> 00:13:19.630
Oh it's so sweet and juicy.

00:13:21.852 --> 00:13:22.778
(man speaking foreign language)

00:13:22.778 --> 00:13:23.853
(he laughs)

00:13:23.853 --> 00:13:26.990
(crowds chattering)

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:29.870
Never in my life have
French fries on a taco

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:32.090
tasted and sounded so delicious.

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:33.490
That was absolutely awesome.

00:13:34.752 --> 00:13:35.810
Here, we gotta try this.

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:37.570
- It's the same meat, but--
- OK.

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:39.590
We're right down the
lane from where we just

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:42.194
ate an exploding French fries taco.

00:13:42.194 --> 00:13:43.527
OK, hola.
- Hola.

00:13:44.992 --> 00:13:47.080
- It's called pancita.
- And it is the?

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:49.350
- Beef stomach.
- Beef stomach.

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:54.350
- But it's in a spicy
broth with smoked chiles,

00:13:54.572 --> 00:13:56.889
I think it's guajillo, and pasilla.

00:13:56.889 --> 00:13:57.895
Those kinds.

00:13:57.895 --> 00:14:00.750
And the beef have four stomachs, right,

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:04.580
so it's different texture
for (laughing) each of them.

00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:06.960
- [Mark] Cool.

00:14:08.139 --> 00:14:09.390
- Squeezing.
- (laughing) Squeezing.

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:10.980
- [Mark] Hold your stomach in.
(he laughs)

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:13.860
- It looks like it's a clay
cauldron just full of soup,

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:16.170
red soup, and it's called pancita,

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:19.788
which is a variety of cow
stomachs within a soup.

00:14:19.788 --> 00:14:21.420
And it's gorgeous, you can see

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:23.260
just herbs overflowing in there.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.270
There's a paddle there she uses to

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:27.420
stir it with, and she just dishes it out.

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:29.005
This place is bumpy.

00:14:29.005 --> 00:14:30.649
(dishes clinking)

00:14:30.649 --> 00:14:32.777
(crowds chattering)

00:14:32.777 --> 00:14:34.392
(soup splashing)

00:14:34.392 --> 00:14:37.149
(woman speaking foreign language)

00:14:37.149 --> 00:14:40.149
(crowds chattering)

00:14:44.903 --> 00:14:47.231
(Julia laughing)

00:14:47.231 --> 00:14:50.229
- Mm.
(they laugh)

00:14:50.229 --> 00:14:52.142
- Esta bueno?
(dishes clinking)

00:14:52.142 --> 00:14:55.142
(crowds chattering)

00:14:58.180 --> 00:14:59.350
- The first thing that you have to

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:01.700
admire here is the size of this spoon.

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:02.740
That's a good-sized spoon.

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:04.855
I'm gonna dip it, I'm just gonna taste

00:15:04.855 --> 00:15:05.688
the broth first before I do anything.

00:15:05.688 --> 00:15:06.920
They added some onions, some cilantro,

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.846
and some lime as well in here.

00:15:08.846 --> 00:15:11.846
(crowds chattering)

00:15:12.897 --> 00:15:14.130
Oh.

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:15.780
Has like this smoky flavor to it.

00:15:17.271 --> 00:15:19.089
Can taste like a roasted flavor.

00:15:19.089 --> 00:15:22.170
And it does have a little
bit of an organy taste to it.

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:24.150
That's delicious, I got
some onions in there too.

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:26.840
OK, now to try some of the chunkier bits.

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.840
Oh, how 'bout this,
this chunk right there?

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.781
Oh yeah, that looks like
it has some texture.

00:15:31.781 --> 00:15:34.698
(crowd chattering)

00:15:35.744 --> 00:15:37.510
It's really tender.

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:41.740
Mm, it is a little bit jiggly.

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:43.776
That broth is awesome though.

00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:45.760
It's made with roasted chiles,

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.320
so it has that wonderful
smoky chile flavor to it.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.850
- [Man] Green salsa,
this is like guacamole.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.600
- [Mark] OK, and also maybe that chile.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.517
(crowd chattering)

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:01.240
Thank you so much.
- Oh, you're welcome.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.530
I think it's better in taco.

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:04.090
- That's the way everybody's eating it,

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:06.730
if you look around this
massive dining room.

00:16:08.085 --> 00:16:10.073
- It's very oily, yes.
- Very que?

00:16:10.073 --> 00:16:12.190
- Oily.
- Ah, very oily.

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:15.060
- And spicy.
(dishes clinking)

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:16.460
- Hold on, I wanna get that chile.

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:20.547
That was a little bit chewy.

00:16:20.547 --> 00:16:22.670
A little bit rubbery.

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:24.135
But delicious.

00:16:24.135 --> 00:16:27.135
(crowds chattering)

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:30.730
In the kitchen back here, they're boiling

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:33.150
more of the soup, and
that just bubbles away.

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:35.250
That's a serious boil.

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:36.640
And then I guess once it cooks here,

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:39.300
then they transport it to the clay vessel

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:40.150
at the front, that's where they

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:41.760
distribute it, that's where they serve it.

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:44.452
And then, wow, I can feel the heat comin'

00:16:44.452 --> 00:16:46.740
off the tortillas over here
that they're making fresh,

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:48.260
and by the way, the tortillas here

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.743
are also top-notch, excellent.

00:16:50.743 --> 00:16:53.743
(crowds chattering)

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:58.620
Not only was that food
amazing, but it just...

00:17:00.169 --> 00:17:01.920
It will arouse your senses.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.726
That's so visual,
there's so much going on.

00:17:04.726 --> 00:17:08.070
(crowds chattering)

00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:11.350
There's enough food in this
market to make you go dizzy.

00:17:13.225 --> 00:17:15.318
Pambazo, yeah, I've never tried that.

00:17:15.318 --> 00:17:17.473
(sizzling)

00:17:17.473 --> 00:17:19.073
- Pambazo?
- Pampazo con todo.

00:17:19.073 --> 00:17:20.396
- Si.

00:17:20.396 --> 00:17:22.484
(sizzling)

00:17:22.484 --> 00:17:24.879
(speaking foreign language)

00:17:24.879 --> 00:17:26.525
- [Man] Roja, por favor.

00:17:26.525 --> 00:17:29.775
(relaxed cumbia music)

00:17:42.529 --> 00:17:43.362
- Hola.

00:17:48.699 --> 00:17:49.532
(Mark laughs)

00:17:49.532 --> 00:17:51.600
- [Mark] Wow, what's
the name of this again?

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:52.760
- [Man] This is a pambazo.

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:54.922
It's a bolillo, which is bread,

00:17:54.922 --> 00:17:59.922
and it's fried and
dipped in a tomato sauce.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.813
- [Mark] So that's why it's
red colored, the tomato sauce?

00:18:01.813 --> 00:18:03.015
- Yeah, that's why it's red colored.

00:18:03.015 --> 00:18:03.848
- [Mark] Coating all of
the bread, and fried.

00:18:03.848 --> 00:18:04.681
- (laughing) Yeah.

00:18:04.681 --> 00:18:06.634
And then it's filled with potatoes,

00:18:06.634 --> 00:18:10.840
and chorizo mix, and
they also put lettuce,

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.640
cream, and cheese on
there, and salsa of course.

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:14.623
(he laughs)

00:18:14.623 --> 00:18:15.720
- Gonna eat it here?
- Just eat it.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.136
- [Man] Let's go.

00:18:17.136 --> 00:18:20.136
(crowds chattering)

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:22.547
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:18:22.547 --> 00:18:24.715
- Cheers!
- Pambazo cheers!

00:18:24.715 --> 00:18:27.965
(relaxed cumbia music)

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:30.573
- Oh, yeah.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:32.913
Oh, wow.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.560
That is flavorful.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:36.400
Can taste the chorizo in there,

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.000
you can taste the salsa, the cream.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.748
The bread is pretty cool.
- Not healthy, but very good.

00:18:41.748 --> 00:18:42.878
- Yeah, definitely.
(he laughs)

00:18:42.878 --> 00:18:44.863
- The chorizo is really good in there.

00:18:44.863 --> 00:18:47.863
(crowds chattering)

00:18:48.736 --> 00:18:52.165
The chorizo in there,
that's what rocks it.

00:18:52.165 --> 00:18:54.780
That's what flavors, that's what powers

00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:56.770
this entire sandwich, is that chorizo.

00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:59.632
How is it?
- Extremely good.

00:18:59.632 --> 00:19:01.070
- Gracias.
- Gracias.

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:02.430
- You will not believe how many different

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:04.130
types of salsa and meat juices are

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:06.210
all over my fingers and
all over the camera.

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:08.312
All over the camera. (laughing)

00:19:08.312 --> 00:19:11.562
(relaxed cumbia music)

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.570
This market is just out of control.

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:28.470
There are just masses
of fresh ingredients.

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:30.666
Any kind of Mexican food
you can possibly imagine,

00:19:30.666 --> 00:19:32.790
you can buy the ingredients here.

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:35.140
Do you need a pinata?

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:38.620
You have about 1,000 different choices,

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:41.254
from dinosaurs to Power Rangers.

00:19:41.254 --> 00:19:42.286
Mamey.
- Mamey.

00:19:42.286 --> 00:19:46.286
(man speaking foreign language)

00:19:47.466 --> 00:19:51.466
(man speaking foreign language)

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:56.420
- Provecho. (laughs)

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:57.450
- (laughing) So many people here.

00:19:57.450 --> 00:19:58.600
I got sandwiched.

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.360
This is a fruit called mamey.

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:03.090
It kinda looks like an oval egg shape.

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:04.630
This is a fruit I've never tried.

00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:06.292
And on the inside it
looks similar to a papaya.

00:20:06.292 --> 00:20:09.292
(crowds chattering)

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:11.503
Mm.

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:13.556
Oh.

00:20:13.556 --> 00:20:14.389
- It's like meaty, right?

00:20:14.389 --> 00:20:15.399
- It's really sweet.

00:20:15.399 --> 00:20:18.731
It's almost like a
condensed, non-juicy papaya,

00:20:18.731 --> 00:20:23.731
with a very sweet, almost
honey sweetness to it.

00:20:27.269 --> 00:20:28.469
It's a very dense fruit.

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:32.467
It's like condensed sweetness.

00:20:32.467 --> 00:20:33.850
(crowds chattering)

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:37.400
we have just emerged from
the depths of the market.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.310
If you go the to dictionary,
and if you search

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:43.580
for culinary wonderland, La Merced,

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:45.520
this market will be
one of the top results.

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:47.090
It's amazing.

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:49.920
If you love food, you will just be in awe.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:50.753
I was just walkin' around

00:20:50.753 --> 00:20:53.380
with my jaw open, my mouth drooling.

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:56.650
There's so much food, there's
so many fruits and vegetables,

00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:58.446
there's so much color,
there's so much energy.

00:20:58.446 --> 00:21:01.190
(man speaking foreign language)

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:03.074
- [Man] Do you want it with chile?

00:21:03.074 --> 00:21:04.809
(man speaking foreign language)

00:21:04.809 --> 00:21:07.642
(traffic roaring)

00:21:11.854 --> 00:21:13.640
- [Julia] Yay, gracias.

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:14.680
- I just love how they cut

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:17.180
the mangoes here into like a bouquet.

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:18.350
It looks like a flower.

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:21.690
He sprinkles on quite a nice
layer of that chile chamoy.

00:21:25.751 --> 00:21:27.770
I think I got it all over my chin.

00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:29.000
Oh, that's delicious.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.110
The mango is sweet, and then you've got

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:33.395
that salty chamoy, which contrasts it.

00:21:33.395 --> 00:21:35.895
(laughs) I got it all over my chin.

00:21:35.895 --> 00:21:37.040
(woman laughing)

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:38.240
Yeah, the mango's sweet.

00:21:39.102 --> 00:21:42.185
(energetic drumbeat)

00:21:45.423 --> 00:21:48.256
(traffic roaring)

00:21:49.306 --> 00:21:50.665
- Hola, buenos dias.
- Buenos dias.

00:21:50.665 --> 00:21:53.800
(Moises speaking foreign language)

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:55.845
- We're on our way now to downtown.

00:21:55.845 --> 00:21:58.740
Micah also got a mango
without any seasoning.

00:22:01.481 --> 00:22:03.730
He ate the entire top half.

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:04.866
Oh hi, Micah.

00:22:04.866 --> 00:22:07.949
(energetic drumbeat)

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:11.650
So this is the center,
downtown of Mexico City,

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:13.850
and we're going to a place
that's called El Moro.

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:16.326
And they are legendary.

00:22:16.326 --> 00:22:20.080
This is the place you come in
Mexico City to eat churros.

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:22.050
The takeaway line actually snakes

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:23.640
all the way down the outside,

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.140
but the line for sitting in is

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:27.400
not that long, so we
decided to get a table.

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.900
We're gonna sit down, we're gonna

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:30.940
sample the churros here, the original.

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:33.633
We're getting permission
to enter churro paradise.

00:22:33.633 --> 00:22:35.475
(crowds chattering)

00:22:35.475 --> 00:22:36.308
- Gracias.

00:22:38.079 --> 00:22:42.079
(man speaking foreign language)

00:22:56.586 --> 00:22:59.336
(sugar spilling)

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:04.380
- This place is as crazy
and as hectic as the market.

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:07.320
But in a totally different,
churro kind of way.

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:08.850
I didn't want to stay in
the kitchen for too long,

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:10.990
because it's so hectic, and
they have such a system,

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:11.823
I don't wanna get in their way.

00:23:11.823 --> 00:23:13.350
But they allowed be to just go back

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:14.710
and see how they make the churros.

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:17.260
They have the batter
coming out of a spigot,

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:19.620
and he's such an expert,
the churro master,

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:21.056
he takes these long chopsticks

00:23:21.056 --> 00:23:22.760
and he kind of swirls it around

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:25.790
into a giant circular
shape, coil after coil.

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:28.315
It's like a hose, it's
like a doughnut hose,

00:23:28.315 --> 00:23:31.521
and then it goes into a bath of sugar.

00:23:31.521 --> 00:23:34.521
(crowds chattering)

00:23:36.755 --> 00:23:37.842
- Ensopeo.

00:23:37.842 --> 00:23:41.140
You got to introduce your
churro on the hot chocolate.

00:23:42.395 --> 00:23:44.045
It's called sopear.

00:23:44.045 --> 00:23:47.295
(relaxed cumbia music)

00:23:51.106 --> 00:23:51.939
- Oh yeah.

00:23:51.939 --> 00:23:55.270
They're crunchy, they're gooey,
in the perfect kind of way.

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:56.860
They're sugary.

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:58.730
It's sweet and salty.

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:00.030
It is really, really good.

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:05.510
Wow.

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:07.855
Oh that's amazing, dip
it in the chocolate,

00:24:07.855 --> 00:24:09.783
you've got the extra chocolate factor,

00:24:09.783 --> 00:24:14.010
you've got the milkiness
of it so it's juicy.

00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:16.340
Yeah, I think what's good to me is just,

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:19.740
it's just the perfect gooey crunchy

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:21.220
texture combined all together.

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:23.660
If you love churros, if you love sweets,

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:26.060
this is a place you have
to visit in the world.

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:27.912
Yeah, those churros are next-level.

00:24:27.912 --> 00:24:31.162
(relaxed cumbia music)

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:35.680
We're walking on our way to el zocalo,

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:38.940
and there are just masses of people.

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:43.940
But el zocalo is the historic
center, it's the main plaza.

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:47.743
Everything in Mexico City
sort of leads to el zocalo.

00:24:47.743 --> 00:24:49.892
And we're coming up on it very soon.

00:24:49.892 --> 00:24:52.975
(energetic drumbeat)

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:08.430
We made the walk through
the sea of humanity.

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:10.310
We made it to el zocalo.

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:11.210
This is the central plaza,

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:14.097
it's a giant plaza, it just opens up.

00:25:14.097 --> 00:25:17.430
There's some very
important buildings here.

00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:20.604
This is where they hold
a lot of public events,

00:25:20.604 --> 00:25:23.740
places where lots of people can gather.

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:25.480
Wow, it's huge here.

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:54.797
(simmering)

00:25:54.797 --> 00:25:57.797
(crowds chattering)

00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:05.010
We're stopping next to eat esquite,

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:07.891
and it is a very common Mexican

00:26:07.891 --> 00:26:10.160
street food snack throughout Mexico City.

00:26:15.094 --> 00:26:15.927
- [Man] Esta bueno?

00:26:15.927 --> 00:26:17.320
- Really nice.

00:26:19.847 --> 00:26:22.430
(man laughing)

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:25.960
- Whoa.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:27.810
I got a big chunk of mayonnaise.

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:28.800
And that's good.

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.980
Yeah, the corn, the salsa in there's

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:33.541
salty, a little bit spicy.

00:26:33.541 --> 00:26:34.900
It's creamy.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.057
It's also warm on a cold day.

00:26:39.057 --> 00:26:42.307
(relaxed cumbia music)

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:46.750
It's a fantastic street food snack.

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:48.800
It tastes so good, it's
so addictive, it's salty,

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.903
it's limey, it's cheesy, it's creamy.

00:26:51.903 --> 00:26:55.153
(buskers playing jazz)

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:02.760
- Turkey tortas.
(Mike laughs)

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:05.990
We've made it to the next spot on this

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:08.310
Mexican street food tour of Mexico City.

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:10.120
This is a place, you can
see in the window here,

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:12.948
they have some giant fried turkeys.

00:27:12.948 --> 00:27:16.198
(relaxed cumbia music)

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:28.210
- Yeah?
- Mm hmm.

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:29.043
- Very good.

00:27:29.043 --> 00:27:30.870
Simple, but very tasty.

00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:32.210
- This place has been serving them

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:35.210
since 1928, this is an institution.

00:27:37.936 --> 00:27:40.563
(dishes clinking)

00:27:40.563 --> 00:27:41.396
Mm.

00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:44.260
Yeah, the bun is really, really soft,

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:45.820
and then you've got the shreds of turkey.

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:48.470
It just tastes like a classic.

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:50.020
Some chiles.

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:56.910
Soup in a coffee cup.

00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:02.780
Oh, that's just like
straight up turkey broth.

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:05.220
It's, yeah, I think you're supposed to

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:07.280
add your own salt, 'cause it's not salty.

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:11.230
But it is good, it's very turkey.

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:14.250
The turkey torta is
over, this is the spot.

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:17.140
It's yeah, it's been around
for a long, long time.

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:19.570
Overall it's good, a little
bit plain, but pretty good.

00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:22.631
We've got one more stop on
this Mexican street food tour,

00:28:22.631 --> 00:28:25.481
and it's gonna be a good final ending.

00:28:25.481 --> 00:28:28.564
(energetic drumbeat)

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.240
Here it is, the final stop.

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:41.830
You want a cheek?

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:42.880
Cheek, and--

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:45.200
- Yes I want a cheek, very badly.

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:48.440
- We try the cheek, and there's also eye.

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:50.430
There's ear.

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:52.408
- Choose me your two favorite.

00:28:52.408 --> 00:28:56.084
(talking over each other)

00:28:56.084 --> 00:28:58.010
(man speaking foreign language)

00:28:58.010 --> 00:29:00.378
- Ah, everyone has their
favorite, man. (laughs)

00:29:00.378 --> 00:29:02.656
- [Mark] My trust is in you.

00:29:02.656 --> 00:29:06.656
(man speaking foreign language)

00:29:08.581 --> 00:29:11.581
(crowds chattering)

00:29:13.326 --> 00:29:16.260
- [Man] (sighing) OK.

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:17.637
(glasses clinking)

00:29:17.637 --> 00:29:21.061
(relaxed cumbia music)

00:29:21.061 --> 00:29:23.650
- [Mark] Which salsa is for this?

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:25.870
- [Man] I'd go with the red one.

00:29:31.181 --> 00:29:35.181
(man speaking foreign language)

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:42.118
(laughing) You know you
have a good taco technique

00:29:42.118 --> 00:29:44.250
when the meat doesn't fall off.

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:45.130
- Cheek taco.

00:29:51.134 --> 00:29:52.568
Oh.

00:29:52.568 --> 00:29:53.401
Oh.

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:55.423
Wow.

00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:57.093
That's insane.

00:29:57.093 --> 00:29:59.670
It's fatty, it's juicy, mm.

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:04.190
- A little bit chewy.
- A little bit chewy.

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:05.844
The beef cheek is so good.

00:30:05.844 --> 00:30:07.290
- Great, great, great, great, great.

00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:09.592
- Amazing tacos, the best flavor.

00:30:09.592 --> 00:30:10.910
It's my favorite.

00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:12.210
- It's absolutely amazing.

00:30:13.474 --> 00:30:15.390
- Cheers, man.
- Cheers.

00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:19.270
Next one is cabeza, which is
a mix of all the head meats.

00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:20.103
So there's some cheek in there,

00:30:20.103 --> 00:30:22.940
there's some eye, there's some...

00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:24.390
- [Man] Some I don't know what it is.

00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:28.059
- Yeah, some parts you don't
wanna ask are in there.

00:30:28.059 --> 00:30:31.309
(relaxed cumbia music)

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:37.200
That's spectacular.

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:40.170
- [Man] Which are better, cheek or cabeza?

00:30:41.354 --> 00:30:42.604
- I don't know.

00:30:44.017 --> 00:30:46.450
I sorta like the cabeza, the mix, yeah.

00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:48.140
That's just a blend of head.

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:54.490
So we've come to the end of this

00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:56.940
incredible Mexican street food tour.

00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:57.901
- [Man] It was crazy.

00:30:57.901 --> 00:30:59.690
- It's been so much fun
hanging out with all of them,

00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:03.230
and, they are just
starting a YouTube channel,

00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:04.870
it's called, what's the name?

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:06.410

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:08.280

Goodbye from Mexico City.

00:31:40.891 --> 00:31:42.945
- Bye!
- Bye bye!

00:31:42.945 --> 00:31:45.440
- Hasta luego!
- Nos vemos!

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.820
- Tell me what was your
favorite food from the day.

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:49.900
- It's hard to decide but
for me it was the pambazo,

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:52.450
the bolillo filled with potatoes

00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:54.680
and chorizo, it was the best.

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:56.762
- Mine was the quesadilla of chicharron.

00:31:56.762 --> 00:32:00.980
- I loved the head tacos of
Los Cocuyos, really good.

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:03.460
- My favorite one was the beef taco

00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:04.890
with French fries on top.

00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:08.480
And it is something that you will

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:10.830
only find at markets, and maybe we will be

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:13.375
coming back soon, so don't
forget to stay tuned.

00:32:13.375 --> 00:32:14.400
(laughing)

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:18.220
- Yes, OK, and I have to say
the quesadilla de chicharron.

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:20.420
- Mine was also the taco
with the French fries on top.

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:21.620
I loved it.

00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:22.852
- Yeah, quesadilla with
cheese, yeah. (laughing)

00:32:22.852 --> 00:32:24.752
- [Man] Quesadilla with cheese, great.
