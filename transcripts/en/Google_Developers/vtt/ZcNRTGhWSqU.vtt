KORY JEFFREY:
Welcome, everybody.

00:00:01.794 --> 00:00:04.010
We are on-site at Founder
World in San Francisco.

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:05.460
I have with me Daniel.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.431
He is the founder
of Artisan Ethos.

00:00:07.431 --> 00:00:08.680
Daniel, thank you for joining.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.710
DANIEL KATZ: Thank
you for having me.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.500
KORY JEFFREY: So tell us,
what is Artisan Ethos?

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.160
DANIEL KATZ: So
Artisan Ethos is like

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.810
an online, curated gallery.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.860
Basically, we gather
the best artisan

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.710
craftspeople from
all around the world

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.696
and sell their products
on an e-commerce platform.

00:00:22.696 --> 00:00:23.696
KORY JEFFREY: Very cool.

00:00:23.696 --> 00:00:25.779
So you're going
directly to artisans?

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:26.570
DANIEL KATZ: Right.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:27.240
KORY JEFFREY: You're
kind of cutting out

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.805
the broker in the middle.

00:00:28.805 --> 00:00:30.930
What's the quality of stuff
that you can get there?

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.305
DANIEL KATZ: So, basically,
it's-- I mean, as an example,

00:00:33.305 --> 00:00:36.500
it would be something like
hair masks, fur, leather bags.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.300
The best English
silverware makers,

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.630
the best Japanese
ironware makers, the best

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.650
Japanese kimono makers.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.030
And a lot of the stuff that
they're going to be making

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.397
are very modern things.

00:00:49.397 --> 00:00:50.980
But everything is
the highest quality.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.880
So you'll get
hand-stitched leather bags

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.620
from the best French calfskin.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.480
KORY JEFFREY: Wow.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.271
How does that work?

00:00:57.271 --> 00:00:58.680
How do you find your artists?

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.220
DANIEL KATZ: So, a lot of
it is just about networking.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.800
It's going out and looking.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.490
We have partners all
around the world.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.830
So somebody in France
and Italy and Japan,

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.800
they speak the local language.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.750
They have connections
there with these people.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.450
And they go and source
these products, basically.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.719
And I basically curate these
products for this website.

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:21.260
KORY JEFFREY: So
the artisans love it

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.960
because it's another opportunity
for them to sell their goods,

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.150
and consumers love it because
it's much cheaper for them

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.649
to buy.

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:27.580
DANIEL KATZ: Exactly.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.620
And the artisans get paid a lot
more than, maybe, a designer

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.717
would pay them.

00:01:31.717 --> 00:01:32.550
KORY JEFFREY: Great.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.133
DANIEL KATZ: Yeah,
the best part of it

00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:36.330
is that these artisans
don't have an outlet.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.240
So they usually sell for their
own local, domestic market.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.589
Maybe a few boutiques in
that country would sell it.

00:01:43.589 --> 00:01:44.880
They don't have a world market.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.540
They don't have a place
where they can actually

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.210
sell these crafts.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.236
KORY JEFFREY: So
how do you maintain

00:01:51.236 --> 00:01:52.360
that quality is high level?

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.470
How do you ensure that
the artisans that you get

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.100
are the artisans?

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.120
Is a closed network,
and it's hard to get in?

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.190
DANIEL KATZ: Yeah.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.110
First of all, it's
basically like a trial.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.970
And they have to
send me a sample so I

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.870
can see that it is the best.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.082
Plus, when I sell
the products, I'm

00:02:10.082 --> 00:02:11.290
not just selling the product.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.580
I'm selling the craftsperson
who made the product for you.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.197
So you can see their profile.

00:02:16.197 --> 00:02:17.280
You can see their history.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.870
You can see the
history of the craft.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.620
You see photos and
videos of them actually

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.960
producing the craft, producing
it with different steps.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.370
So you don't really get
that with something you buy.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.890
You get to know your maker.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.087
And that person is
actually making it for you.

00:02:31.087 --> 00:02:31.920
KORY JEFFREY: Great.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.920
That's very cool.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.620
So where is the product today?

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:36.810
DANIEL KATZ: It's in beta.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.988
There's a website,
artisanethos.com.

00:02:39.988 --> 00:02:42.620
And I'm just basically
testing the market.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.500
And I'm looking for investment,
which is kind of why I'm here.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.589
I was hoping to find some
angels or seed funding.

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:51.130
KORY JEFFREY: Sure,
meet some people.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.671
Have you had any
luck meeting people?

00:02:52.671 --> 00:02:56.290
DANIEL KATZ: A few
people, but not many yet.

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.101
KORY JEFFREY: Sure.

00:02:57.101 --> 00:02:57.600
Very cool.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.683
Well, there's lots around.

00:02:58.683 --> 00:03:00.990
So you have to find them.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.167
So let's switch
gears a little bit.

00:03:03.167 --> 00:03:04.750
Obviously, as you
walk around, there's

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.840
a whole bunch of technology
on display, a lot of people

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.440
in different areas.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.030
Is there anything in particular,
besides the e-commerce market

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.460
that you're working in, that
particularly excites you?

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.730
DANIEL KATZ: Yeah, app
development in general,

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.110
which is kind of why I like
this organization you have,

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.850
Google Developers.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.200
Just in general, UX UI
design really excites me.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.110
And one of the other
reasons I'm here

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.570
is I was hoping to find an
app developer that would

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.220
be working with us, hopefully.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.240
KORY JEFFREY: So looking for
some technical talent, as well?

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.700
DANIEL KATZ: Exactly, yeah.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.825
Because right now everything's
through Squarespace.

00:03:39.825 --> 00:03:41.370
And that's great
for the website,

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.517
but I want an app as well--
iOS and Android in the future.

00:03:44.517 --> 00:03:45.350
KORY JEFFREY: Great.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.400
Very cool.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.210
I guess, a related question,
do you have a favorite Google

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.100
technology?

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.040
DANIEL KATZ: Yes, the
Google Translate app,

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.525
the one that uses the camera
to translate everything.

00:03:54.525 --> 00:03:56.400
It's simple to use for
when you're traveling.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.608
KORY JEFFREY: Yeah, for sure.

00:03:57.608 --> 00:04:00.120
And obviously you do a
lot with the company.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.674
It seems like magic, doesn't it?

00:04:01.674 --> 00:04:03.590
You just kind of hold
it up, and it tells you.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:04.242
That's awesome.

00:04:04.242 --> 00:04:05.950
Well, thank you very
much for joining us.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:06.350
DANIEL KATZ: Thank you.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:07.304
KORY JEFFREY: Awesome.

00:04:07.304 --> 00:04:08.720
And thank you guys
for joining us.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.050
We are on-site at Founder
World in San Francisco.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.500
