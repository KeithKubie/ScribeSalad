00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.390
My son loves making things out of play dough.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.400
Making it from scratch lets me introduce
him to a very important idea in chemistry.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.080
If you mix two or more substances together,

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.980
sometimes you end up with something very different.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.970
We're going to make something really special using these ingredients.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.170
First the flour, and then the salt.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.810
Can you mix it for me?

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.990
Putting salt into the flour like this produces a mixture.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.480
In science, this is when two substances

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.880
are physically combined but no reaction has taken place.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.320
I'm using slightly bigger grains of salt here

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.820
to show you that the flour and the salt are still here in their original form

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.220
and that they can be separated using a
physical process

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.090
like sieving.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.560
What happens if you put this in there?

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.150
It'll turn blue?

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.490
Ooh!

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.790
When liquids like water and food colouring

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.810
completely mix like this we call it a
solution. 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.900
What happens if you put the oil in?

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.640
It will turn yellow.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.440
Bubbles!

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.720
The particles in the oil are held together

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.980
very tightly so they do not mix with
water.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.430
Oil is also less dense than water so it
floats on top.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.250
Can you put it in there for me please?

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.670
All of it!

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.250
It feels so nice!

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.480
Let's see what happens if you take it out of the bowl

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.980
Shall we try that? Yeah!

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.580
Putting all these ingredients together and kneading them

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.960
has produced something new

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.280
This is because chemical reactions have taken place.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.500
It would not be very difficult to turn this

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.580
back into the ingredients that we
started with originally. 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.060
Adding water allows long chain-like molecules called proteins

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.160
from the flour to stick together
helping to hold the water in place

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.400
and keepint the dough together.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.220
Salt helps in this process by letting
the proteins stick together more strongly.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.010
It also stops the dough going bad. The
oil coats the other ingredients and helps

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.080
to keep it from drying out.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.480

We'd love to see your photographs and videos of you doing this activity

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.500
