00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well let's make upwards forces have to balance downwards forces.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The only downwards force we have is mg, 50 N that must be balanced by the normal force,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
so that has to also be 50 N.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We can do the same thinking for left and right to show that this force,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Brent's pushing force must equal Aayush's, so that's 100 N.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Now, this problem wasn't too difficult because all of the forces where in

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
were in what we could call the xy plane.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
They were all either vertical or horizontal.

00:00:26.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Let's see what happens when we make things a little more complicated.
