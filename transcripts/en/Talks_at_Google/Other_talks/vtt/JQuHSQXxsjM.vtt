00:00:00.786 --> 00:00:02.540
BORIS DEBIC: Welcome
everybody.

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.830
I am extremely pleased to
welcome today Mark Blyth.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.780
Mark Blyth will share with us
his insights into austerity as

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.620
it takes shape in the
European Union.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.520
Let me read a little bit
from his biography.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.240
Mark Blyth is a faculty fellow
at the Watson Institute,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.030
professor international
political economy in Brown's

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.880
political science department,
and director of the

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.190
university's Undergraduate
Programs in Development

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.000
Studies and International
Relations.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.470
He's also the author of "Great
Transformations--

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.180
Economic Ideas and Institutional
Change in the

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.770
20th Century."

International Political
Economy," co-editor of a

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.590
volume on constructivist theory
on political economy

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.620
titled "Constructing the
International Economy," and

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.380
he's working also on a new
book that questions the

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.540
political and economic
sustainability of liberal

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.880
democracies, called "The
End of the Liberal

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.110
World." That's dramatic.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.530
Blyth is a member of the
Warwick Commission on

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.770

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.090
Science Review," "Perspectives
in Politics," "Comparative

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.780
Politics," and "World Politics."
He has a Ph.D. in

taught at Johns Hopkins
University from 1997 to 2009.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.780
Please give a hand
to Mark Blyth.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.226
MARK BLYTH: Thank you.

00:01:45.226 --> 00:01:46.476
Cheers.

00:01:50.056 --> 00:01:51.270
Is this mic on?

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.790
Yes?

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:52.560
Can you hear me?

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.980
Hello?

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.020
Right.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.750
So I have a Scottish accent.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.580
There's surprise number one.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.610
And those slides started to
change themselves, which is

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.200
surprise number two.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.460
OK, how am I going
to start this?

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.790
Why did I write this book?

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.120
I wrote this book for the
following reason--

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.960
I got really, really pissed off
with people with lots of

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.180
money telling people who don't
have any money they need to

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.010
pay shit back.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.510
That's basically it.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.040
I grew up on the butt end of
the British welfare state.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.110
I'm an orphan, and I was
raised by my paternal

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.000
grandmother.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.690
So I am the greatest living
example of inter-generational

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.115
social mobility you're ever
going to see, because I'm a

00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:30.740
freaking Ivy League professor.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.710
So I went from there to there.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:33.560
How did I do that?

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.300
Because of this thing that gets
blamed called the welfare

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.980
state, that bloated,
paternalist, out of control,

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.550
incentivizing, demotivating
piece of crap called the

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:44.750
welfare state.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.070
Now, why is this a completely
bullshit story?

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.080
Well, that's not, but why does
it turn into a bullshit story?

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.150
It turns into a bullshit story
for the following reason--

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.270
back in 2000, the number one
concern of financial markets

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.750
globally was there wasn't going
to be enough federal

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.500
debt, because we had balanced
the budget.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.460
Seriously, the number one
concern was there wouldn't be

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.660
enough T-bills.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.150
So fast-forward 13 years, ah,
we're all freaking out.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.120
Now, in between, a couple
interesting things happened.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.820
So you have a balanced budget,
which basically means over

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.370
time, as the economy
grows, your debt

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.210
stock is going to shrink.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.020
And that's why people had
a problem with it.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.660
So you're going through a
period of rapid growth.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.410
This was the tech boom period,
all this sort of stuff.

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.490
And then there's 9/11.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.260
So there's a little dip in the
economy and a guy called

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.880
Greenspan comes along and says,
let's cut interest rates

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.185
and essentially do asset
protection for everybody who

00:03:29.185 --> 00:03:31.940
has bought assets by giving them
more or less free money.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.713
So then we decide on top
of that we're going to

00:03:33.713 --> 00:03:34.550
have two tax cuts.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.740
Why?

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.180
Because we just need
more money.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.660
Screw it.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:37.770
We're just going to do it.

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:38.870
Let's have some tax cuts.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.100
No corresponding way of paying
it off, or whatever, we'll

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.210
just take the tax cuts.

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.430
And then we'll decide to fight
two wars of choice for dubious

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.610
political reasons without
raising any taxes.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:48.430
That'll be a good one.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.340
So by the time you get
to 2006, there's

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.040
61% debt to GDP already.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.120
I don't remember anybody in
Congress, particularly

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.860
Republicans, jumping up and down
about the crazy level of

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.910
federal debt in 2006.

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.060
And then in 2007 and
2008, there's a

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.390
run on the repo markets.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.890
Basically, the hidden story of
the financial crisis that

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.890
nobody really talks about-- it's
actually quite simple--

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.510
is that because there was a
shortage of T-bills, because,

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.800
in fact, many of them were in
China, because they keep

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.890
buying a lot of them, we started
to use AAA mortgage

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.510
products as collateral for short
term financial deals in

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:20.790
the repo markets.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.360
As the housing crisis happened,
those bonds that

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.390
made up those instruments
fell from AAA to B to C.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.180
At that time, that meant that
if you were a heavily

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.600
leveraged financial
organization-- a Bear Sterns,

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.420
for example--

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.430
and you were using these things
as pledges and as repo

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.200
collateral, as they fell in
value, you had to use more and

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.270
more of them to borrow the
same amount of money.

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.520
Unfortunately, you couldn't do
that, because there's a fixed

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.410
stock of the assets.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:44.740
And they're hugely levered.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.420
This meant a 3% return against
their asset base, rendered

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.910
them effectively insolvent.

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.430
Once everybody figured this
out, you shout fire in a

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.310
crowded theater, everybody
freaks out,

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.090
heads for the exits.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.210
You get a liquidity crunch.

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.740
You've got a financial crisis.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.890
We decided to bail out the
system rather than let it

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.960
fail, because it was
too big to fail.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.340
The costs of doing so were
basically a 30% drop in tax

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.450
revenue across the OECD
countries, because the

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.590
financial sector had become so
big, particularly in the

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.290
United States and the United
Kingdom, that it was

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.270
generating huge amounts
of taxes.

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.740
At the same time, the economy
slows down as the liquidity

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.910
crunch hits the real economy
and affects lending and

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.190
borrowing and spending.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.580
Consumer expenditures trend
down, as do consumer

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.920
expectations, as do investment
expectations.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.470
You get caught in a slump.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.720
Once you get caught in a slump,
automatic transfers in

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.210
the economy mean that benefits
go up at the same time as tax

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:32.540
revenues go down.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.150
So you're going to have
a bigger deficit.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.390
As you have a bigger deficit,
you multiply that over time,

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.580
you issue more debt, you go from
61% to 100% debt to GDP.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.180
That's why we're here.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.300
There was no orgy of
public spending.

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.210
It's a lie.

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.040
I take Amtrak every day.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.990
I would've noticed an orgy
of public spending.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.780
If there was an orgy on public
spending, it was on asset

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.213
protection and income protection
for the people who

00:05:56.213 --> 00:05:59.100
had made out with the most for
the past 30 years when we

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.340
bailed out those assets.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.090
That's actually what happened.

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.010
Now, here's the inequity of the
[INAUDIBLE] in this whole

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:07.100
thing-- why is it that social
security, which isn't even

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.640
part of federal budget
calculations on the deficit,

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.260
which, by the way, has a $2.3
trillion surplus, that has to

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.950
be cut so we can pay back the
debt accrued by bailing out

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.220
some of the richest people
in our society and

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:20.620
ensuring their assets?

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.400
Does anybody else think that's
total horse shit?

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.740
Because I really do, and that's
why I wrote this book.

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.720
Now, here's the weird thing.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.730
We're actually not in
that much of a mess.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:30.550
It's been a sticky recovery.

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.270
It's been a technological shock
to a lot of service jobs

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:34.790
that we didn't expect,
et cetera.

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:36.680
But nonetheless, we haven't
been cutting them.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.750
Because of that, the federal
deficit's projected to be

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.520
around 3% next year--

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.470
even with a margin of error
in the projection, say 4%.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:47.190
Britain has its own currency,
like us, and has been cutting,

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:48.590
been doing austerity.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.820
Having done that, it's now
looking at 7%, totally

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:52.340
[INAUDIBLE]

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.850
growth, and a possible
triple-dip recession.

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:57.030
Europe has been cutting like
there's no tomorrow.

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.040
They've got the leaches on
the corpse and they're

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.510
opening up the veins.

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:03.860
Greece has lost 30% of
GDP in four years.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.680
The German army didn't manage
that between '41 and '45.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.390
That's how much damage has
been done by this.

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:12.750
So the question is
the following--

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.820
why is it that Europe,
particularly the European

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.310
Union, the part that we think of
as the most kind of, if you

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:22.040
will, welfare-statish-friendly
transer, et cetera, suddenly

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.840
became this huge doomsday
device for this enormous

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.490
experiment on austerity, which
so far has cost around 30% of

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:32.170
GDP in the periphery and has
generated 25 million extra

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:35.380
unemployed in comparison
to the United States?

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:38.200
Seems like something
to investigate.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.760
So, there's a standard picture
of Europe in terms of its

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.720
fiscal balances.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.380
As you can see, the United
States around here, 2012.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.890
By the way, always look at the
net figure, because if you

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:48.680
look at the gross figure,
that assumes

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.600
that nobody pays taxes.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.870
And given that we all just wrote
checks just a little

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:54.970
while ago, that would tell you
that you really shouldn't look

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:55.620
at that one.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.810
It also it seems the country
has no assets.

00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:59.910
And if that's the case, why do
we have the National Security

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:03.170
Investment Act to stop
people buying assets?

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:04.820
So obviously, look
at the net one.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.120
So you look at the net
one, where are you?

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.590
Well, basically, everybody's
kind of in the

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:10.500
mire, more or less.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.540
So what brought about
this fine mess?

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:13.410
Age check in the room.

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:17.900
Anybody who's giggling now
is over the age of 40.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.870
On the left, we have Laurel and
Hardy, and on the right,

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.950
we have Angela Merkel
and Sarkozy.

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:23.890
There we go.

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:26.500
I put that in purely for comedic
values, just to make

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.020
sure everyone is paying
attention.

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:29.966
And actually, they did bring
about this fine mess, so that

00:08:29.966 --> 00:08:31.240
is a serious point.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.350
So what's the story here?

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:33.825
Well, there's an
official story.

00:08:33.825 --> 00:08:35.679
It's what I call story one,
and this is the sort of

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:38.370
vaguely sophisticated version
that you get if you read

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:40.429
things like "The Economist,"
"The Financial Times," et

00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:41.200
cetera, et cetera.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.190
And I'm going to tell you why
it's total crap, because it's

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:44.460
not really true at all.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.080
So there's story one
and story two.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.980
So here's the official
story, story one.

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:49.350
You do this by looking
at this.

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:50.950
This is interest rate
convergence over

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:52.580
10 year bond spreads.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:54.680
So if you go back in the day
before there was this thing

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.580
called the Euro, when everybody
had their own

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.950
currency, if you were buying a
bit of Greece on 10 years,

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:03.140
there's a 25% risk premium
you're getting paid for

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:03.990
holding that.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:06.150
That means that basically
there's a one in four chance

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.160
they're going to default.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.560
Why would you price that in?

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:13.460
Well, because they haven't run
a budget surplus in 50 years.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:15.990
Because they've been taking
turns to steal the state and

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:18.910
using other people's rents and
revenues to do it since they

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:22.450
basically ended the Civil War,
so why would you not price

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:23.950
this at 25%?

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:26.010
Then have a look at the French,
the Italians, the rest

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:28.780
of the Mediterranean, it's
strained around 15%.

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.810
This whole [INAUDIBLE]
in here, over 10%.

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:31.640
That's a lot.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:34.940
You're getting paid a lot for
just holding a 10 year debt.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.610
Now, that reflects the real
price of the bond, the real

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:39.390
risk of default that's
in the bond.

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:41.200
Now, the official story
goes like this--

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.890
around 1991 there was this
wonderful treaty called the

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:44.830
Maastricht Treaty.

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:45.910
Well, that's '86.

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:47.660
'91 is the Monetary Treaty.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:49.870
And we decided that we're going
to build this monetary

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:50.940
union in Europe.

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:51.870
And what did that mean?

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:54.300
It meant basically that you're
going to have this German bank

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.220
called the Bundesbank
generalized

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:57.560
across the whole area.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.500
All the people that currently
have inflation and exchange

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.510
rate risk and default risk no
longer will have it because

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:05.730
we're going to take away
their printing presses.

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:07.790
And once we've locked up all
the printing presses in the

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:10.380
one time deal and given them
to a guy in Frankfurt, and

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:12.440
he's the only one who can
print the money, well,

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:15.260
basically doesn't that mean that
Greece becomes Germany?

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:16.960
Doesn't that mean that Italy
becomes Germany?

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.170
Because after all, they
can't inflate

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:19.050
their way out of trouble.

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:20.510
So you get rid of that risk.

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:23.010
You can't devalue your way,
which is a backdoor way of

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:24.280
solving the same problem.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:27.090
All you can either do is
deflate-- austerity--

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:30.050
which is politically
unpalatable, or you basically

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:32.320
sort your economy out and
everybody kind of becomes

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.200
German, and that's
the great plan.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.900
And you can see how this
is represented

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:36.740
in this risk premium.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:38.140
There's where the
Euro comes in.

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:41.160
And then there's a 7 and 1/2
year period where basically

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.540
all of these countries-- think
about how diverse this is--

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:47.590
everyone from Belgium to Italy
to Greece to Spain to Portugal

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:50.600
have basically got exactly
the same default risks.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.800
Now, that's kind of odd if you
think about it for more than

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:53.280
two minutes.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.350
So what's behind this?

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:57.430
Well, the story goes
like this.

00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:00.120
Basically, what's undermining
this-- if you go back to the

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.565
end here and you see where the
spreads go up right, why does

00:11:02.565 --> 00:11:04.220
it all start to go wrong?

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:05.990
Well, if you have a look here,
your current account and

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:07.920
balances, exports and imports.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.650
And you'll find that what
you've got here is most

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:12.220
countries in the Euro, the major
countries, are basically

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.800
running deficits all
the way through.

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.110
And the only one that starts
to run a surplus here is

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:20.290
Germany, which picks up just
as the Euro comes in and

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:22.150
becomes the export powerhouse.

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:24.560
Now, when you control for the
size of the German economy

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.560
relative to everybody else, what
you begin to realize is

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.370
that their surplus is
the counterpart

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:30.440
everybody else's deficit.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:34.410
In other words, somebody has
to buy all those BMWs.

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:36.600
And if you're buying all those
BMWs, you're not making your

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.610
own [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:39.530
and selling them back
to the Germans.

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:41.110
So you start to get these
current account imbalances.

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:42.350
But that begs the question--

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:44.620
where did all these guys in the
south get the money to buy

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.630
the BMWs in the first place?

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:49.010
Well, that's your story about
lax public finances.

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:51.170
This is these countries that
are spending too much.

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:52.460
So look, it's the PIGS--

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.520
Ireland, Spain, Greece,
Portugal.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.430
The Netherlands we'll put
in a bracket, right?

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:57.890
But basically, look--
a huge amount.

00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:00.230
That's 10% year on year annual
growth of government

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:00.700
expenditure.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.990
They are spending like drunken
sailors, there's no doubt

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:05.400
about this.

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.990
Now, what made this possible?

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:09.570
As I said before, this is the
ECB, being Deutschbank Uber

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:11.830
Alles, taking inflation
and devaluation

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:13.070
risk off the table.

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:16.840
And also, the Maastricht
criteria for Euro gives

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.430
credible rules against sovereign
misbehavior.

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:22.050
You can have a 60% debt
load, 3% deficit,

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:23.780
and variable inflation.

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:26.110
And as I said, the yields
converge, and the countries

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:27.030
over-borrow.

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:29.210
As we saw in those last three
slides, they're basically

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:31.090
spending too much money.

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:34.290
But then what does that do
to your competitiveness?

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:36.130
Well, it's going to obviously
hit your competitiveness.

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:38.300
If you're spending that much
money and you've got a huge

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:41.420
trade imbalance, you've got to
be basically awarding yourself

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:43.800
way above productivity
wage increases.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:44.800
And look at what you've got.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:48.170
Ireland, Spain, Italy, Greece,
Cyprus, Malta, Portugal.

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:49.270
The PIGS again.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:51.890
And look at these massive labor
cost changes over the

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:53.060
last 7 year period.

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:54.840
You're awarding yourself
pay increase you

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.980
can not hope to cash.

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:59.130
So this is all a very convincing
story, right?

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:00.640
And what made this possible?

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.950
Well, of course, what made it
possible is cheap debt.

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:04.000
Because as those yields

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.880
converge, look what's happening.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.070
Portugal is borrowing.

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:08.040
Spain is borrowing.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:08.850
Greece is borrowing.

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:09.740
Ireland is borrowing.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:11.430
Look who's actually
in surplus.

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:13.000
The Germans and the
Netherlands.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.160
So their savings are financing
their consumption.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:19.090
So these countries have
massively over-borrowed.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.970
With the take-home being the
southern countries have

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:22.840
borrowed too much.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.280
Now, have a look at this
network diagram.

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.780
It's kind of interesting,
because there's a question

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:27.686
mark there for a reason.

00:13:27.686 --> 00:13:28.830
There's Portugal.

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:31.550
Relative sizely economy
123 billion euros.

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:33.120
Spain, 345.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.680
Italy, very big-- nearly
half a trillion.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:38.650
But pretty much all of their
bonds are domestically held.

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:40.720
60% are long-term domestic.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.540
The ones that are 10-year
rollover escalate by 10%.

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:44.270
Look at this.

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:47.600
Look who's popped up here, with
a trillion dollars of

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.570
crap assets lying on their
balance sheet.

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:52.570
It's the Brits, the world's
largest financial entrepot.

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:54.010
And look who's up here.

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:57.890
It's those prudential Germans,
who save a lot and tell

00:13:57.890 --> 00:13:59.710
everyone to upgrade
their scales.

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:01.550
They've got half a trillion
of debt going on.

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:03.270
So what do you mean the southern
countries have

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:05.160
borrowed too much?

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.930
There's a rather large problem
with this story.

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:11.580
You can't have over borrowing
with over lending.

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:15.840
This is actually a Citibank
advertisement.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.620
Some of you who are over the age
of 16 may remember this.

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.300
The largest ever advertising
campaign for a finance company

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:26.330
in the world was Citi's
campaign, "live richly," from

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:28.560
2003 to 2006.

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.730
It didn't invite you
to save up money.

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:32.700
It didn't invite you
to be prudential.

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:34.520
It said live richly.

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:37.330
It didn't even say be rich.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:40.870
You kind of have to have rich
before you spend it unless

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:43.350
you've just got a giant
line of credit.

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:46.220
So let's run that story again.

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.780
Here's the greatest moral hazard
trade in human history.

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.850
Remember the whole story I told
you about the ECB and

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:52.240
credibility and all
the rest of it?

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:53.780
Here's why it's complete
horse shit.

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:55.740
Because what actually
happened was this--

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:57.950
I'm a large European bank.

00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:00.960
I know that I've got a sovereign
behind me that, if I

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:04.480
become really big, I'll become
too big to fail.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.840
Which basically gives me a
license for doing whatever the

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.570
hell I want because then
it will all be bailed.

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:12.760
It gives me a funding cost
advantage, and it means that

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.830
basically I can lever up well
beyond human reason with

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:17.470
pretty much no consequences.

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:19.910
And the more powerful I become,
the bigger threat I am

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:21.150
to that sovereign.

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:23.250
And eventually, if the sh-- hits
the fan, well, you know,

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:23.900
I'll get bailed out.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:24.920
It's totally fine.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.470
So imagine I know there's this
thing called the Euro coming

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:31.673
in, and you're all other
European banks, and you know

00:15:31.673 --> 00:15:34.270
that you could earn a nice
little bit of coupon buying

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:36.140
this Greek bond at 25%.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:37.160
There aren't that many
of them-- it's a

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.460
thinly traded market.

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:40.400
But if you can get it,
if you lose, fine.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.250
But the upside's great--

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:42.450
25%.

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:45.250
Now, what happens if everybody
really believes this Euro

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:47.760
story and everybody starts
to converge down?

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.540
Well, I'm going to make
less and less money on

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:50.640
those bonds over time.

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.250
So a quick bit of math
up in your head.

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:56.850
How would you make even more
money on a declining spread?

00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:59.780
You've go to use volume, you've
got to use leverage.

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:01.830
So what you do is you basically
get the balance

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:04.450
sheet of your bank and you cram
it with as much periphery

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:05.860
debt as you possibly can.

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:08.450
You take all your nice, safe
German, Dutch bonds and you

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:09.320
throw them out.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.830
And you pile on as much Greek
debt and as much Portuguese

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:14.040
debt and as much French
debt as you can.

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:16.650
And you turbo charge that,
running operating leverage of

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:19.540
around 40 to 1, which means your
equity cushion is less

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:22.570
than 3% percent of your
asset footprint.

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:25.420
You make Lehman Brothers look
like a prudentially run

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:27.075
organization.

00:16:27.075 --> 00:16:29.240
And you do this because you've
got a guarantee.

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.410
The guarantee is the state.

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:31.540
The state will come
and rescue you.

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:33.010
You get in trouble,
you're fine.

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:34.850
Except there's a slight
flaw in the plan.

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:37.070
What happens when the
Euro comes in?

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:38.930
You have to give up your
printing press.

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:41.520
So that means your state can't
bail you out anymore.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:42.660
Well, that's even better.

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:44.890
Because then I become
a systemic risk.

00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:48.090
I'm not just a risk to France,
I become a risk to the entire

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:49.810
European banking system.

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:50.810
Score!

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:52.790
I've got the ECB
over a bottle.

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:54.890
I can do whatever I want because
they're going to have

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:55.640
to bail me.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:59.590
Except it's run by Jurgen Stark
and a bunch of Germans.

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:01.320
And they're not going
to bail you.

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.520
So when the shit hits the fan,
you've got a really, really

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:04.630
big problem.

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:07.119
Which is where we are now.

00:17:07.119 --> 00:17:09.740
Core banks get stuffed with
periphery debts gone bad, a

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:11.000
result of over landing.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.440
Foreign banks consolidated
claims on Greece, Ireland,

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:16.550
Italy, Portugal, and Spain in
2011, last time they published

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:18.050
any reliable figures.

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:22.190
French banks have over 33% of
GDP equivalent on their

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:25.750
balance sheets in periphery
assets that aren't coming back

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:26.960
anytime soon.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.770
Add in the Spanish real estate
loans they've got on there--

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:30.170
run.

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:31.420
And you have a SocGen account.

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:38.140
Netherlands, one bank,
ING, 211% of GDP

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:39.200
is its asset footprint.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.970
Leverage ratio is
over 40 to 1.

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:43.960
That alone is 30%
of Dutch GDP.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.000
They don't have a printing
press anymore.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.940
Are you beginning to
see the problem?

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:52.300
The result is assets held by
banks in Germany, France, and

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.000
the UK are about double the
annual GDP of the entire EU.

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:00.250
Here's the too big
to fail USA.

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:03.610
Top six bank assets,
61% of GDP.

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:05.910
Any one of them fails, even
allowing for systemic

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:08.740
interconnections, you're going
to take out 10% of US GDP.

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:12.190
That's about $1.4 trillion,
$1.5 trillion.

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:14.560
That's a lot, but when you've
got your own currency, you've

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.840
got the global reserve asset,
we can deal with that.

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:17.500
We can bail it.

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:18.140
We've done it.

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:18.795
That's what we did.

00:18:18.795 --> 00:18:20.950
It cost of a $3 trillion
all told, that's it.

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:24.740
We're now in recovery mode.

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:26.830
At least the Brits have
their own currency.

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:29.040
There's British GDP.

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.900
That's the size of
their banks.

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:36.280
You should be very,
very afraid now.

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.620
Now let's have a look
at this one.

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:40.210
Here's France.

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:42.880
BNP Paribas, Agricole,
Generale.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:47.620
These three banks alone are
taking you up to 250% of GDP,

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:50.790
and they don't have a printing
press, and they're seriously

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:52.900
impaired with bad assets.

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:53.890
And now here's the kicker.

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:55.050
You know that ECB?

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:56.350
It's a fake central bank.

00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:57.900
It's really a currency board.

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:00.320
Because what it does is it says,
we're not doing bond

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:04.180
buying, we're not mutualizing
debt, you have to look after

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:05.200
the problem yourself.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.520
So when you have a
financial crisis,

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:07.980
you've got four exists.

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.230
You can either inflate--

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:11.240
whoops, you don't have
a printing press.

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.400
You can devalue--

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.650
whoops, don't have your
own currency.

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:15.950
Or you can do austerity.

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:20.380
You can squeeze and hope you
stabilize public finances, add

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:23.110
liquidity, keep the can kicking
down the road-- this

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:25.810
is LTROs, all the loans that
have been given to the banks.

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:28.360
But at the end of the day,
you cannot do a Bernanke.

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:29.070
So what's a Bernanke?

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:32.140
A Bernanke is when you go into
the banking system and you

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:35.300
grab the shitty assets on their
books and you put them

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:37.180
on the Federal Reserve's
balance sheet.

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:40.770
And you call them things like
Maiden Lane 2, and the

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:44.570
Termloan Auction Facility 3,
and a bunch of completely

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:47.400
opaque nonsense that nobody will
ever understand unless

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.280
they spend time looking
into this.

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:51.790
Congress, who basically don't
understand anything, are

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:53.820
completely oblivious to
what's going on--

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:56.270
you then flush the entire
system out with as much

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:59.610
liquidity as you can, and you
allow them to recapitalize as

00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:00.440
they de-lever.

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:02.750
Which is why the operational
leverage of the American banks

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:05.660
is now about 50 to 1 rather than
30 to 1 at the height of

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:06.580
the crisis.

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:08.630
They've rebuilt, they've
recapitalized, they've cleaned

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:09.590
their balance sheet.

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:11.470
As the economy recovers,
you know all those

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:12.810
assets that you bought?

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:13.310
Guess what?

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:16.720
Those houses in Glendale one day
will have value again, and

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.610
you sell them back
to the banks.

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:19.830
It's not a money pump.

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:22.010
It's an asset swap
with liquidity.

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:24.080
The ECB can't do that.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:27.240
It is constitutionally and
intellectually incapable of

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.450
making that move.

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:31.090
Consequently, what the markets
were pricing is as yields were

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:34.480
spiking was the possibility
of a breakup of the Euro.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:37.320
Because if any one of those
banks goes down, it doesn't

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.080
stop at Spain.

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.700
It doesn't stop at France.

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:44.190
It goes all the way back
to the German banks.

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:46.920
If that goes bad, it's game
over for the core European

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:50.160
banks, which is why we really
have austerity policies.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:53.140
It's about stopping a bank run
around the bond market.

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:55.290
This is why you've got to keep
the Greeks in at all costs.

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:58.130
Because if you're a bank, and
you've got 2% of your assets

00:20:58.130 --> 00:20:59.270
in Greek debt--

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:01.360
say you're exposed to
Greece heavily.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.510
How are you going to
get rid of that?

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:02.775
Well, you can't.

00:21:02.775 --> 00:21:05.930
You can sell it on the hedge
funds basically at 20% on the

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:06.970
face value.

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:08.380
Or you can hope it
doesn't go bad.

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:10.185
But imagine you wake up one day,
and you think, this is

00:21:10.185 --> 00:21:10.680
going to go bad.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.680
You want to sell it, so
you sell it first.

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:14.453
The minute all those contracts
hit the floor, what

00:21:14.453 --> 00:21:15.170
happens to the price?

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:17.250
Everybody else dumps theirs
and they go to the floor.

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:19.200
You've now made a 2% loss
to your portfolio.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.540
How do you balance it back?

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:23.150
You sell the next asset class
before it goes down.

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:25.290
Hi, Portugal, how are
you this morning?

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:26.440
So you dump Portugal.

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:28.290
And as those prices go to
zero, what do you do?

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:30.460
You look around and you go,
shit, what have I got left?

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:31.900
Let's dump the Irish, then.

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:34.520
So you throw the Irish on the
floor, prices go to zero.

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:37.510
You've now knocked 11% of
Euro-zone GDP and probably

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:39.330
about 12% of your portfolio.

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:41.830
You do that on the lending
portfolio of a highly levered

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:44.210
bank, what's going to happen to
its share price once people

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:45.460
figure out?

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:49.630
So you're going to have a huge
panic that's caused by a

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:52.860
sovereign bank run, right the
way through a currency union,

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:55.230
something that is supposed to
be theoretically impossible.

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:57.510
That's what this has
always been about.

00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:58.970
That's why you keep
the Greeks in.

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:01.250
That's why you're willing
to destroy 30% of GDP.

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:04.250
Because this is about saving
Societe Generale, and it is

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:07.410
about saving Deutsch Bank from
their own over borrowing and

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:10.120
over lending mistakes.

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.190
Consequences.

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:13.820
You can't solve a banking
problem with budget cuts.

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:16.940
You can cut Greek's public
spending to Neolithic levels.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:19.060
It's not going to make a damn
bit of difference to SocGen's

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:20.210
balance sheet.

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:22.240
You can't run a gold standard
in a democracy.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.970
We tried this in the 1920s.

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:26.270
It really didn't work too well--
ended up with a few

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:28.480
political parties that
were kind of nasty.

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.480
You can't solve a solvency
problem with a liquidity

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:31.070
instrument.

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:34.020
But God bless Mario,
he's been trying.

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:36.470
You just add enough liquidity
and hope the problem goes away

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:38.480
by saying, I'll do whatever
it takes.

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.500
That's what he said six months
ago, the yields came down.

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:43.800
Since then, he's actually done
nothing, and yet the yields

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:46.020
have gone down, proving one
thing-- it's about the

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:47.810
credibility of bank policy.

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:49.710
It's not about cutting
the budget.

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:53.540
The markets aren't craving an
extra 30,000 civil servants

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:55.300
being thrown out of
work in Greece.

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:57.900
They're worried about the
Euro breaking up.

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:00.160
So once you give a credible
guarantee, you do a

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:03.730
Bernanke-lite, all of the market
pressures are relieved.

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:06.120
That was what was lacking
the whole time.

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:11.645
And the most important one is
you can't all cut at once and

00:23:11.645 --> 00:23:12.730
expect to grow.

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:13.600
Why not?

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.710
Because in order to save,
you need to have income

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:16.690
from which to save.

00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:18.890
So if everybody simultaneously
cutting,

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:20.510
nobody's generating income.

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:23.100
So imagine the economy with an
80% debt to GDP ratio, and

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:26.010
turn it into a simple fraction
of four over five.

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:28.430
Now imagine that 40% of
the five is government

00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:29.050
expenditure.

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:29.860
You want to cut in half.

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:30.970
You're really going to credibly

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:32.380
commit to cut the budget.

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:34.610
So you just turn that
into four over four.

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:37.190
On a constant stock a debt, your
debt to GDP ratio just

00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:39.470
went from 0.8 to 1.

00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:42.130
Every single country that's
undergone an austerity program

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:44.360
now has more debt than
when they started.

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:47.010
Any country the hasn't cut,
including the United States,

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:49.610
now has proportionately less.

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:51.356
The evidence is in.

00:23:51.356 --> 00:23:53.950
And the tragedy is it was
all avoidable, and

00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:55.960
we knew this already.

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:58.510
So why did anybody, especially
in Europe, ever think this was

00:23:58.510 --> 00:23:59.340
a good idea?

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:01.490
For that, you have to kind of
have to go back in time.

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:03.300
And it's still about
two rival stories.

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:06.490
This time it's not ECB
credibility versus the moral

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:07.470
hazard trade.

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:09.450
It's something far
more spooky.

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:13.190
The first one I like call
liberalism's emetic economics,

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:16.490
emetic being a wonderful word
meaning to throw up.

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:18.890
And what's this all
about throwing up.

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:21.180
You go back to John Locke's
"Treatise on Government." The

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:22.460
fifth chapter is really
fascinating.

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:24.600
John Locke is this guy who's
basically the intellectual

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.750
propagandist of a bunch of guys
who want to kill the king

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:28.600
and take all the property
for themselves.

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.880
They're called the merchant
classes, and these are the

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.630
guys that then set up markets
and land, labor, capital,

00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:35.620
private property, throw
people off the land,

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:36.490
all the rest of it.

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:37.840
You ever heard the
word vagabond?

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:39.475
It means a man without
bondage.

00:24:39.475 --> 00:24:40.380
Why bondage?

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:42.590
Because basically, you've been
thrown off your land, so you

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:44.850
basically had your status
removed from you.

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:47.340
So basically, the English
Revolution sets up the markets

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:48.950
in private probably,
et cetera.

00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:50.760
And then there's a problem,
because the minute you do

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.580
this, you recognize that
untrammeled markets lead to

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:54.580
massive income and wealth
inequalities.

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:56.210
Which is great if you happen
to be the guy at the top of

00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:58.080
the pile, and not so great
if you're at the bottom.

00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.880
So unfortunately, then
you need a sate.

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:00.960
Why do you need a state?

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:02.730
To make markets, in
the first place.

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:05.120
The notion that they pop out of
the ground fully formed is

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:07.090
a nice fiction, but
simply not true.

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:10.260
In order to turn serfs into
workers, you actually need

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:12.230
acts of parliament
and legislation.

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:14.120
The state makes these
things happen.

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:15.480
But here's the kicker.

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.870
You need to state to police
the inequalities that the

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:18.950
market makes possible.

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:20.360
Because if you don't--

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:23.146
poor Adam Smith on this one--
"for every rich man"-- this is

00:25:23.146 --> 00:25:24.360
out of "The Wealth
of Nations"--

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:27.535
"for every rich man, there must
be 500 poor, and that

00:25:27.535 --> 00:25:30.420
rich man must sleep always with
the strong arm of the

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:33.870
civil magistrate at his side,
for he is always regarded with

00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:36.230
jealousy and envy."

00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:38.130
So you need that state to
police the inequality.

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:39.580
But here's the Lockean kicker.

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:41.140
This is why we have the
Second Amendment.

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:43.740
Any state strong enough to
police those inequalities is

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:46.260
strong enough to come
and take your money.

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:47.930
So you've got a dilemma
running into this.

00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:50.390
You need this state, you can't
live without it, but at the

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:52.530
same time, you can't live with
it, because you're afraid of

00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:53.430
the damn thing.

00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:54.440
So how are you going
to do this?

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:55.600
And how are you going
to pay for it?

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.830
Because most people don't
want to pay any taxes.

00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:00.740
Well, that's where this guy
comes in, David Hume.

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:03.010
He has a wonderful essay on
money and on interest.

00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:06.300
He talks about merchants being
the most useful race of men,

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:08.120
because when you give it to
them, even though money's

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:10.300
neutral in the long run, if
you give it to him and his

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:13.350
friends, it goes to the right
places really fast.

00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:15.690
So basically, you think of money
in a Keynesian way from

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:18.620
Hume, which is short-term
stimulus is long-run neutral,

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:19.760
but really because
you give it to my

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:21.550
friends rather than losers.

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:23.410
Now, what he comes up
with is the problem

00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:24.620
with government debt.

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:26.620
Liberalism loves debt, because,
if you think about

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:28.470
it, it's a free option
for the state.

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:30.760
So you're the state, I'm the
merchant, I've got lots of

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:32.010
inequality in my society--

00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:33.570
I'm worried about people
coming and

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:34.830
burning my house down.

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:36.380
So I say to you, you
need to protect me.

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:37.490
And you say, you
need to pay me.

00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:38.550
And I say, I don't want
to pay taxes.

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:40.820
You say, ah, I have this thing
called a debt instrument.

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:41.510
It's fabulous.

00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:42.330
You go, how does that work?

00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:43.310
Well, it works like this.

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:45.510
You give me a better paper,
and I'll give

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:46.680
you a million pounds.

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:47.060
Brilliant.

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:48.380
OK, what happens now?

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:50.670
In 10 years time, I'll give you
the million back, and I'll

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:52.480
pay you interest.

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:53.200
What are you going to say?

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:56.620
So I'll lend you the money you
need to protect me, and then

00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:59.190
you'll give me it back and
you'll give me interest.

00:26:59.190 --> 00:26:59.880
Fabulous.

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:00.950
It's a free option.

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:02.900
Unlimited upside,
zero downside.

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:04.240
Problem.

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.130
Original argument against it.

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:07.180
Crowding out.

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:09.160
In order for this to work,
you're going to offer a rate

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.510
of interest higher than the
market would produce.

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:13.350
So everybody goes in
to government debt.

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:15.770
Because of this, as Hume says,
all the gold and silver

00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:18.450
necessary for commerce gets
crowded out of the economy,

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:20.830
finds its way into debt
securities, the whole nation

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:23.420
ends up in hock, eventually you
have to sell yourself to

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:24.770
foreigners, and you
end up with a

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:26.110
bankruptcy of the nation.

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:27.820
So easy money and
crowding out.

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:31.140
The downside of debt means that
it's an attractive way of

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:33.190
paying for the state you need
but you don't want, but at the

00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:34.410
same time, a terrifying one.

00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:36.310
Because at the end of the day,
it's going to result in the

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:37.700
ruin of the nation.

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:39.520
Adam Smith picks
up on this one.

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:42.650
For him, it's all about why we
actually save and invest, why

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:44.610
x equals i in economics
to this day.

00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:45.860
Savings equals investment.

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:46.310
Why is this?

00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:48.240
Well, for him, it's because
we're all parsimonious Scots,

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.650
we're all hardwired to save.

00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:54.351
There's a wonderful line where
he says, "where there is

00:27:54.351 --> 00:27:57.140
tolerable security, a man would
be perfectly crazy if he

00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:00.630
did not employ as investment
all his available capital."

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:02.220
So basically, you take the
money, you invest, it

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:04.410
automatically produces
economic growth.

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:07.090
Well, he also recognizes this
whole thing about inequality

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:07.990
in the state.

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:10.260
My favorite line from
Adam Smith.

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:12.630
"Civil government, insofar
as it is instituted, is

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:16.190
instituted for the defense of
the rich against the poor, or

00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:18.640
for those who have property
against those who have none."

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.030
That is not Karl Marx.

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:23.010
That is Adam Smith, end of Book
Two of "The Wealth of

00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:25.010
Nations," quote, unquote.

00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:27.280
Now, he recognizes then that
you're going to have to pay

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:28.880
for this, so he goes
to taxation.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.720
But the forward of "The Wealth
of Nations" starts off with

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:31.710
progressive taxes.

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:32.750
It's totally nuts.

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:35.730
So here, look, see the people
who have got the most stuff?

00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:37.050
They have the most
skin in the game.

00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:38.710
They should pay the
most taxes.

00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:40.300
And then he goes, wait a
minute-- that would mean the

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:41.430
rich would pay the most taxes.

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:42.610
Well, we can't have that.

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:44.650
So then he backs off immediately
and turns around

00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:46.620
and argues for exactly
what the Republicans

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:47.700
are arguing to do--

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:52.120
a national consumption tax on
everything except luxuries.

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:54.050
So your yacht is fine,
but your corn flakes

00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:55.310
are going to be taxed.

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:56.220
Problem with this.

00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:58.080
Well, it never raises
enough revenue.

00:28:58.080 --> 00:28:59.030
And he recognizes that.

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:00.760
So he's like, shit, what
am I going to do?

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:02.410
And he goes, I suppose
there has to be debt.

00:29:02.410 --> 00:29:05.690
But the problem with debt is
exactly as Hume's pointed out.

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:07.600
Everybody's going to invest
in the debt markets, the

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.320
underlying economy is
going to crumble.

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:11.700
Because of that you'll end up
with more debt on a smaller

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:14.390
economy, and eventually the
whole nation gets bankrupted.

00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:15.870
So what do you end up with?

00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:19.460
Debt perverting parsimony,
therefore savings doesn't lead

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:21.140
to investment doesn't
lead to growth.

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:23.770
All very convincing, and it's
all exactly the same story as

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:24.520
we hear now.

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:26.630
Now, when you hear the same
arguments repeated for 300

00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:28.915
years without modification
regardless of any facts in

00:29:28.915 --> 00:29:31.880
fact in them, you should
generally be suspicious.

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:35.210
The result is you can't live
with it, can't live without

00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:36.430
it, don't want to pay for it.

00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:38.610
So I like to call this
liberalism's neuralgia and the

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:40.030
aspirin of austerity.

00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:42.420
You reach for it regardless of
if it does you any good.

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:44.350
But it's a 300-year-old trip.

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:46.710
Now, how do we know that these
guys are wrong about this?

00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:49.020
Well, basically, at the time
they were writing, Hume

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:52.370
predicted the collapse of the
British economy by, I

00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:54.430
think it was, 1780.

00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:56.400
And in fact, what happened was
they went from the relatively

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.850
low debt levels that they had,
but they were accumulating,

00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:01.080
all the way to the highest debt
that they ever had, which

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:04.850
was 240% of GDP at the end
of the Napoleonic Wars.

00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:07.010
So never mind 80%,
100%, whatever.

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:09.870
Back in the day, they
had 240% debt to GDP

00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:11.150
at the end of 1815.

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:16.510
What happened to the British
economy after 1815 until 1914?

00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:20.490
It ran the hold goddamn world
and expanded faster than

00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:22.780
anyone ever thought
humanly possible.

00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:27.050
Reinhart and Rogoff
95%, my ass.

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:31.020
Now, this creates two liberal
stories that go through the

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:31.840
19th century.

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:33.770
Story one, David Ricardo.

00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:35.705
You can't live with it, and you
don't want to pay for it,

00:30:35.705 --> 00:30:37.240
and you pretend you
don't need it.

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:37.940
Second one.

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:39.990
This is John Stuart Mill,
handsome fellow.

00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:41.450
I know.

00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:44.150
Accepting the need for it,
and also accepting the

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:45.320
need to pay for it.

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:47.190
Because if you don't pay for
it, then you get into a

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:49.785
problem, because if you
basically leave the state out

00:30:49.785 --> 00:30:52.940
of the equation, you cannot rely
on markets to do anything

00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:55.760
except the inequalities that
will undermine markets in the

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:57.280
long-run themselves.

00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:59.210
So you get these two very
different versions of

00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:00.760
liberalism come out of this.

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:03.370
This one goes to the
Austrian economist.

00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:04.910
This one goes to
the Keynesians.

00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:07.470
That's basically the way it
splits down the middle.

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:10.260
Now, along came the
Great Depression.

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:11.240
I love this picture.

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:12.470
It's absolutely emblematic.

00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:15.030
It's one of my favorite slides
of the Great Depression--

00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:17.600
the bread line at the same time
as the, no way like the

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:18.630
American way.

00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:21.955
So reality, theory,
facts, whatever.

00:31:21.955 --> 00:31:23.470
Now, here's the first one.

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:25.200
I like to call this the emetic
response, American

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.080
liquidationism.

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:27.090
This is Joseph Schumpeter.

00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:29.640
And by the way, he actually
looked like that.

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:31.260
This is not an exaggeration.

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:32.805
He really did.

00:31:32.805 --> 00:31:35.540
And he, in the 1920s, had come
over from Austria and

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:37.810
basically taken up residence
running Harvard's economics

00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:38.490
department.

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:41.230
And the basic story was there's
the long run capital

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:43.960
structure of the economy, you
can't really see it, you don't

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:46.120
know what's going on, you
should never intervene.

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:48.880
What happens is that banks,
there are booms and bust

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:49.820
business cycles.

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:51.880
Banks have a problem,
particularly when the bank is

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:52.840
backed by the government.

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:55.660
They produce too much credit,
entrepreneurs get confused

00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:57.630
about price signals, they
invest in things they

00:31:57.630 --> 00:31:59.340
shouldn't, you end up producing
things you're never

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:01.890
going to need, the credit pump
dries up, and eventually you

00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:03.970
have this purging that
needs to happen.

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:06.480
So you binge on credit
and then you purge.

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.420
This is version one
of austerity.

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:11.290
Because of this misallocation of
capital because of credit,

00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:13.305
you end up with too much in the
wrong type of investment

00:32:13.305 --> 00:32:14.470
in the capital structure.

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:16.050
So you basically have the boom,
and then you have to

00:32:16.050 --> 00:32:18.040
have the slump, and you have to
go barf and you have to get

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:21.480
it all out and let the clock
reset, and off you go.

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:23.745
Now, the British had a version
of this, which, you know, of

00:32:23.745 --> 00:32:25.610
course, the British are a bit
more polite than this, so they

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:26.770
wouldn't be emetic.

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:28.490
So they have the treasury
view, which is a

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:29.950
more austere response.

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:32.130
And it's very similar, but
again, it's these arguments

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:33.920
from the 1700s brought back.

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:36.580
So the basic idea is that free
trade is welfare-enhancing.

00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:39.130
Well, the Brits would say that,
because they were 50% of

00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:41.390
the global economy at that point
in time, and most of

00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:43.540
their free trade was
done with empire.

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:46.120
But putting that to one side,
I'm sure the Indians thought

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:47.630
it was free trade when
they showed up,

00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:48.970
and so did the Chinese.

00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:52.180
But anyway, 1910 to 1920s, this
is Churchill when he was

00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:54.630
Chancellor of the Exchequer,
the finance minister.

00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:56.820
He comes out with this
memorandum written by a guy

00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:58.775
called Henderson that basically
responds to a guy

00:32:58.775 --> 00:33:01.270
called Lloyd George's thing
about, can we do something

00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:02.140
about unemployment?

00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:03.240
The problem had been this--

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:05.620
Britain's the largest economy
in the world, World War I

00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:07.950
spanked 60% of its
national wealth.

00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:09.210
They're on the gold standard.

00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:11.140
Basically, exchange rate clever
mechanism for the

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:12.340
global economy.

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:13.010
They have a choice.

00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:15.570
If they go back on the gold
standard with a high exchange

00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:17.570
rate, it protects all the
people who hold sterling

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:20.570
paper, because you're not
devaluing their assets.

00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:23.290
If you go back on a low one,
it benefits the domestic

00:33:23.290 --> 00:33:25.520
economy because you'll get an
export boost and your domestic

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:26.450
economy will go up.

00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:28.830
But all the people holding
sterling paper will freak out

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:29.890
because you've devalued
their assets.

00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:30.850
So they'll dump them.

00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:32.660
So you've got a run on the
pound and a run on the

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:34.540
exchanges, so you're
screwed either way.

00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:35.210
So what did they do?

00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:36.820
They went back on a high
exchange rate.

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:37.280
The result?

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:38.970
An instant extra million
unemployed that

00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:40.200
lasted for a decade.

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.450
So that was one of the lynch
pins in the global economy

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:44.050
that caused the Great
Depression.

00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:45.540
So lots of people are
saying, can't we do

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:46.310
anything about this?

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:48.070
Can't we do something
about unemployment?

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:50.260
And along came the memorandum
that says, no-- and there's an

00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:51.760
argument called Ricardian
Equivalence--

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:54.770
and spending now is going to be
zero sum against taxes in

00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:55.480
the future.

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:58.100
So if you know that, the minute
you do it, it nullifies

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:00.120
its own effects, so
don't even try it.

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:01.880
Second thing, and this is
particularly true on

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:05.150
investment, if government
presumes to do the job of the

00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:07.620
private sector, the private
sector will let it do it, but

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:08.739
then it will do it at a cost.

00:34:08.739 --> 00:34:10.610
Because it's still not
investing, so it's zero sum

00:34:10.610 --> 00:34:11.780
against itself.

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:14.300
And the last one you may
remember from the Obama

00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:17.239
stimulus was the lack of
shovel-ready projects.

00:34:17.239 --> 00:34:18.469
Remember that language?

00:34:18.469 --> 00:34:20.280
It's written in there-- it was
called the lack of suitable

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:21.510
public works.

00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:24.469
Now, here's the second story
that comes out of the John

00:34:24.469 --> 00:34:25.659
Stuart Mill tradition.

00:34:25.659 --> 00:34:27.504
Basically, it's not
about Keynes right

00:34:27.504 --> 00:34:28.389
in the general theory.

00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:29.239
There's a wonderful line by an

00:34:29.239 --> 00:34:30.780
economist called June Robinson.

00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:33.909
She says that, "in 1936, Keynes
was writing down what

00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:38.219
might cause unemployment while
Herr Hitler was curing it."

00:34:38.219 --> 00:34:39.610
There's a certain element
of teaching

00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:41.120
birds how to fly here.

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:43.469
And the two critical cases
here were the Germans--

00:34:43.469 --> 00:34:44.380
as it says here.

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:46.489
There's a story that basically
it was all sort of like

00:34:46.489 --> 00:34:47.739
Catholics in the south that
voted for Germany.

00:34:47.739 --> 00:34:48.510
No it's not.

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:49.590
They were industrial workers.

00:34:49.590 --> 00:34:50.639
They were miners.

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:53.139
And then here's a guy called
Takahashi Korekiyo, who is the

00:34:53.139 --> 00:34:55.880
guy who was the guru for the
Japanese Central Bank's

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:58.160
Abenomics policy at the
moment of massive

00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:59.660
monetary and fiscal stimulus.

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:01.610
So this is a guy from '34.

00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:03.550
So what actually happens here
is very similar to what's

00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:04.640
going on in the Euro-zone.

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:06.680
You have simultaneous
contractions of the five

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:08.320
largest economies
in the world.

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:09.800
Everybody cuts at once.

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:12.530
GDP shrinks, constant stock
of debt goes up.

00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:16.680
The British debt to GDP ratio
in 1930 was 170%.

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:21.160
By 1933, despite repeated rounds
of cuts, it was 190%.

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:22.890
It continued to go up.

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:25.840
In Germany, what happened was,
after short-term capital

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:29.010
United States, post the '23
inflation, had made Germany

00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:31.780
the most stable and fastest
growing economy in Europe at

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:32.970
that point in time.

00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:35.570
There was a swap in the
agreement governing war debts.

00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:37.550
The main war debts
got seniority.

00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:40.620
The American capital pulled out
to take advantage of the

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:44.640
stock market boom in 1928,
'29 and a federal

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:46.300
interest rate increase.

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:48.660
If you get 7% per sticking it
in a bank, so why would you

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:49.740
put it in Germany?

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:50.990
A lot of capital goes
flying out.

00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:53.340
To balance the budget, a guy
called Bruning comes in as the

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:56.050
chancellor, and he starts
hacking away at the budget.

00:35:56.050 --> 00:35:58.890
So he issues somewhere in the
region of about 200 emergency

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:00.510
austerity decrees.

00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:02.510
At that point in time, there's
a minor party that everyone

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:03.010
had written off.

00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:06.140
They got 8% of the vote in
1928, or thereabouts.

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:08.700
By 1930, it was up
to I think 18%.

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:12.280
By 1933, it had 43.3%
of the vote.

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:14.550
It was the only party arguing
against austerity.

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:18.180
I don't think I need to tell
you what they were called.

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:20.010
Japan was even worse.

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:23.610
The brunt of civilian
expenditures, the brunt of

00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:26.780
public expenditure cuts
in Japan were

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:28.300
borne by the military.

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:30.030
They were the biggest
item in the budget.

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:33.300
By 1930, the Japanese military
started to assassinate their

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:35.220
financial elite.

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:37.700
It took out two finance
ministers, two prime

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:40.490
ministers, several cabinet-level
appointees, and

00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:43.110
half a dozen senior bankers.

00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:45.220
You can rack up quite a body
count doing this if you piss

00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:47.240
off the military enough.

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:50.590
So the lesson learned on this
was simultaneous contractions,

00:36:50.590 --> 00:36:52.950
when everybody else is doing
it, is zero sum against

00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:55.390
everybody else, and leads to
really nasty politics.

00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:58.320
So Keynes and events
overturn austerity.

00:36:58.320 --> 00:36:59.360
What does it show us?

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.090
It shows there are fallacies
of composition and

00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:03.110
non-scalability in labor
and money markets.

00:37:03.110 --> 00:37:05.530
What's true about 2 people or
10 people is simply not true

00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:08.280
about 20 million or five
interlinked economies.

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:10.360
There are systemic
non-linearities and difference

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.590
that simple cannot
be done by type.

00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:14.910
Investment expectations are
not about parsimony.

00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:16.760
They're about fear.

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:19.220
And if everybody's fearful for
the future and has myopic,

00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:22.300
short run expectations, and we
look to each other for signals

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:24.620
about whether we should be
investing next month or not,

00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:27.740
you discount the time series
of the 36 good periods and

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:29.280
heavily weight the three
in the front.

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:31.590
That's why it's hard to get
out of a recession.

00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:34.470
The emetic response, you binge
and then you purge, assumes

00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:35.240
you're at the bottom.

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:36.550
People start saving again.

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:38.570
You've got [INAUDIBLE]
consumption, austerity, you

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:39.240
start saving.

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:41.240
And the assumption is that
saving is automatically

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:41.950
investment.

00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:44.360
But there's a drop there,
because you have to invest in

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:45.140
a recession.

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:47.490
Why would you want to be the
guy who takes the chance to

00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:48.760
invest in a recession?

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:51.300
Surely you'd rather be liquid,
so everybody tries to sit on a

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:52.660
liquidity all at once.

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:54.720
But you can't-- in order for
you to be liquid, somebody

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:56.180
else has to be illiquid.

00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:57.590
So you end up with
a liquidity trap.

00:37:57.590 --> 00:37:59.450
And that's when you get
stuck for 14 years.

00:37:59.450 --> 00:38:02.160
That's why the Great Depression
lasted so long.

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:05.590
So because of this, rather than
curtail consumption, the

00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:07.800
austerity response, consumption,
to repeat the

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:10.140
obvious, is the sole end
of economic activity.

00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:13.410
"General Theory," page 71,
if I remember correctly.

00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:14.300
Lessons learned.

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:16.740
It all goes back to
redistribution.

00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:19.160
Democracy is asset insurance
for the rich.

00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:21.070
Don't skimp on the payments.

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:22.860
That's what was going in
the '20s, and that's

00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:24.430
what's going on today.

00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:27.720
Redistribution of debt is
reinsurance for democracy, and

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:30.470
austerity is anorexia
for the economy.

00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:32.910
That was what was
learned by 1940.

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:35.200
Oh, how we forget.

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:36.470
And why do we forget?

00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:39.760
We forget because of Germany,
because Germany is a very

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:41.510
peculiar economy.

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:42.740
It is not a liberal economy.

00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:45.300
It is much closer to Japan than
it is to anything else in

00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:46.760
Europe or the United States.

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:48.950
It is, in fact, the original
developmental state.

00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:50.680
What do I mean by that?

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:53.780
In 1873, there was a huge
stock market bubble in

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:55.490
Germany, and it blew up.

00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:56.700
It was called the
Founders Crisis.

00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:59.550
And liberal economic ideas of
the type we've been discussing

00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:01.110
were completely discredited.

00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:02.990
At this point in time, there
was a guy called Liszt who

00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:04.970
comes along and says, you know,
the funny thing about

00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:07.390
the Brits telling us all the
story about how to get rich,

00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:09.280
if they had actually done that
themselves-- you know what

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.080
their comparative advantage
was in?

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:12.090
Wool.

00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:14.000
They would still be making
blankets for

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.510
the people in Flanders.

00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:17.480
How come they're running
the world?

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:19.390
How come they have the biggest
navy in the world?

00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:21.390
How come they make steel
when they basically

00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:23.150
have no iron ore?

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:24.090
What the hell is
that all about?

00:39:24.090 --> 00:39:26.820
So he rewrote how you think
about international trade.

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:29.910
And at the same time that he
did this, he, and also the

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:31.830
Bismarck who was running the
place did what was called the

00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:33.970
marriage or iron and rye,
bringing together the

00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:36.830
industrialists in the south,
the agrarians in the north.

00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:39.390
You use the surplus from
agriculture to basically buy

00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:40.420
flattened equipment.

00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:42.900
You bring it in, you reverse
engineer it, you do it faster,

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:46.040
you do it faster, you build up
German industrial capitalism.

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:48.650
Big firms, big banks,
forced saving, a big

00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:49.980
role for the state.

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:52.190
And it's all driven
by exports.

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:53.470
There's your difference.

00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:55.710
But when you're exporting and
your sources of demand lie

00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:57.910
outside your economy, you don't
have to worry about

00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:58.510
internal demand.

00:39:58.510 --> 00:40:01.620
The Keynesian story makes no
sense if you're Germany.

00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:03.770
Why would you want to stabilize
consumption if

00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:05.180
you're export dependent?

00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:06.740
Because all you're going to
do is raise your wages and

00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:10.030
prices, and your BMW is going
to go from 50,000 to 100,000

00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:12.070
real fast, and you're not
going to sell them.

00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:14.035
So if you don't rely on domestic
consumption and rely

00:40:14.035 --> 00:40:16.680
on external consumption, the
dynamics of your economy are

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:17.710
completely different.

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:20.180
What do you care about
price control?

00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:22.230
All this stuff about the
neuralgia of the 1920s and the

00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:24.740
inflation experience, this is
a post-war construction.

00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:26.390
It's really about
remaining price

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:28.280
competitive in export markets.

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:30.530
So you need a strong,
independent central bank.

00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:31.990
What else do you care about?

00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:32.750
Very important--

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:33.940
competition.

00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:36.496
You want to have competition
over products, so that you

00:40:36.496 --> 00:40:39.220
have BMW and Audi competing with
each other so they can

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:42.070
sell more to the Chinese both
because they're competing

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:43.220
against product quality.

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:45.470
You don't get involved in the
Apple, Samsung, buy up patents

00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:47.770
and sue each other
in court crap.

00:40:47.770 --> 00:40:50.050
You do real competition
to get real value out

00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:51.170
at the end of it.

00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:53.600
Given that the role of the
state, these Freiburg

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:55.570
liberals-- this is Walter Euken,
one of the guys who,

00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:57.630
post-war, reinvigorates
all this stuff.

00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:59.500
Because after Nazism is
discredited, they

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:00.620
needed a new thing.

00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:03.540
And basically it was about the
economic constitution, where

00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:06.400
competition rather than
consumption becomes important,

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:08.090
and sound money and
central bank

00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:10.170
independence defines the economy.

00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:11.290
Why is this important?

00:41:11.290 --> 00:41:14.150
First of all, for 30 years, this
is the entire structure

00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:15.400
of the Euro.

00:41:17.350 --> 00:41:19.780
If you think about the way the
European Union is set up, it's

00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:22.370
Generalized Ordoliberalism,
to give that type of

00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:23.740
liberalism its name.

00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:26.440
The commission is the important
part, not the

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:27.080
parliament.

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:29.380
The parliament is a talking
shop that very little

00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:31.300
representative rights
or power.

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:33.950
Sound money is far more
important than output.

00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:36.370
It's all about the European
Central Bank and its policy.

00:41:36.370 --> 00:41:38.090
It has one target--

00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:41.470
fighting inflation, even if
there's a deflation going on.

00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:43.050
Well, what does that reflect?

00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:44.820
The need for cost
competitiveness.

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:46.410
What is it that the
commission does?

00:41:46.410 --> 00:41:48.150
The commission basically
sets rules.

00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:49.420
What are those rules about?

00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:50.290
Competitiveness.

00:41:50.290 --> 00:41:52.630
What's the largest component
of the administrative

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:53.850
architecture of Brussels?

00:41:53.850 --> 00:41:55.900
The Competition Commission.

00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:58.810
Rules rather than discretion
at all times.

00:41:58.810 --> 00:42:01.210
You can't trust politicians to
run the economy-- they'll run

00:42:01.210 --> 00:42:04.130
inflationary cycles, that
will be bad for growth.

00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:06.070
Yes, if seen through a
German perspective.

00:42:06.070 --> 00:42:09.080
But here's what it misses, a
giant fallacy of composition.

00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:11.850
For you to sell your BMW,
somebody else needs to be

00:42:11.850 --> 00:42:12.840
buying them.

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:15.330
For somebody to basically be
having an export surplus,

00:42:15.330 --> 00:42:17.650
somebody needs to have
an important deficit.

00:42:17.650 --> 00:42:19.630
In the aggregate, in theory,
it balances out.

00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:21.786
But if you go way back to that
picture I showed of the

00:42:21.786 --> 00:42:24.180
current account imbalances,
there's only one company

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:24.990
running a surplus.

00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:27.180
And the sum of that surplus is
the sum of that deficit--

00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:29.330
they're almost exactly
equivalent.

00:42:29.330 --> 00:42:31.650
So what you have here is a
situation whereby when you

00:42:31.650 --> 00:42:34.120
generalize the economic
principles and institutions of

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:37.050
one country across the whole of
the EU, which was fine, so

00:42:37.050 --> 00:42:39.220
long as the banks were spending
money all over the

00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:42.410
place so nobody noticed,
it's fine.

00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:45.500
But once that credit bubble
pops, suddenly you all have to

00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:46.500
be Germany.

00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:48.630
Tell me, how is Greece
and Portugal

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:50.490
going to make an Audi?

00:42:50.490 --> 00:42:53.210
And even of they did, who are
they going to sell it to?

00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:54.070
Who's going to buy it?

00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:56.120
Imagine the Competition
Commission gets its way and

00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:57.770
everybody becomes more
competitive, and

00:42:57.770 --> 00:42:59.615
they all make exports.

00:42:59.615 --> 00:43:01.100
Who's going to buy
all this crap?

00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:03.320
The over-tapped American
consumer?

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:05.690
We're already spending
too much already.

00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:08.690
So you end up with an economy
and an economic structure, an

00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:11.500
economic model for an entire
continent which literally

00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:12.300
cannot work.

00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:15.430
It makes no sense on a global
level, and yet that's the one

00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:17.130
that it's pursuing.

00:43:17.130 --> 00:43:19.520
Competitiveness rather
than complementarity.

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:21.610
And also, you then have idiotic
things like debt

00:43:21.610 --> 00:43:23.090
breaks, Schuldenbremse.

00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:24.950
This says that nobody can
ever have more than

00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:26.730
a 5% debt on deficit.

00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:27.110
Really?

00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:29.620
Because that means everybody has
to run a budget surplus.

00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:30.890
How is that going to happen?

00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:33.150
That's actually not
arithmetically possible, but

00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:36.050
it doesn't stop them writing
rules about it, even if it's

00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:38.491
arithmetic nonsense.

00:43:38.491 --> 00:43:40.370
This then leads to Italy.

00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:41.770
I'm getting there.

00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:45.110
This guy was the first Prime
Minister of Italy and head of

00:43:45.110 --> 00:43:48.370
the Italian Central
Bank post-war.

00:43:48.370 --> 00:43:50.760
He set up the Bocconi School
of Public Finance in Milan.

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:52.890
The Bocconi School was famous
for two things.

00:43:52.890 --> 00:43:54.390
Number one, public
choice theory.

00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:56.070
Essentially, states are
rent seekers and

00:43:56.070 --> 00:43:56.795
they can't be trusted.

00:43:56.795 --> 00:43:59.330
Hey, if I grew up in Italy, I
would probably think that

00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:00.610
about the state, as
well, but they

00:44:00.610 --> 00:44:02.140
generalized it to everybody.

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:04.950
They're also very fond of the
notion of a European Union as

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:07.950
a disciplinary device overriding
local democracy and

00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:09.860
reigning in state spending.

00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:11.470
The Bocconi School are important
because when

00:44:11.470 --> 00:44:12.070
Cambridge--

00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:15.620
qua Cambridge, UK-- blew up in
the '70s intellectually and

00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:18.130
Cambridge and America had their
lunch in what was called

00:44:18.130 --> 00:44:20.470
the Cambridge Capital
controversies, the only

00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:22.470
economics department in Europe
that was mathematically

00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:24.430
sophisticated enough to play
with the Americans was the

00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:25.530
Bocconi School.

00:44:25.530 --> 00:44:28.000
And they were hard-wired for
seeing the state as a bad

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.220
thing at exactly the time that
liberal economics went in the

00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:32.690
same direction, when
it went neoliberal.

00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:33.980
Consequence of this--

00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:36.730
these guys become an aircraft
carrier for austerity thinking

00:44:36.730 --> 00:44:39.450
that goes from Milan to Harvard,
which leads us to

00:44:39.450 --> 00:44:42.180
today, the financial crisis.

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:43.660
This is Greenspan's mea culpa.

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:48.190
I think there's a flaw in my
ideology, and it's this big.

00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:50.720
And we get to this guy, who's
Alberto Alesina, who, just

00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:53.240
like Joseph Schumpeter, is
arguing for emetic economics.

00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:54.770
And he, too, is the head
of the Economics

00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:55.940
Department of Harvard.

00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:58.050
He's the guy who came up with
what's called the expansionary

00:44:58.050 --> 00:44:59.520
austerity hypothesis.

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:01.900
It's about debt and time and
consistency, which is actually

00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:03.890
that Ricardian equivalence
stuff all again.

00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:05.650
And it basically says the
following-- this is the

00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:06.760
confidence theory thing.

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:08.580
This is why you cut spending.

00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:10.680
So imagine the economy is
falling around your ears, you

00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:12.170
don't know if you're going to
have a job tomorrow, your

00:45:12.170 --> 00:45:14.570
partner is already unemployed,
you really don't know about

00:45:14.570 --> 00:45:17.450
the future, but you really
worry about the debt.

00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:19.520
You just lie awake all night
worrying about the

00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:20.920
debt, as people do.

00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:23.210
So the government credibly
signals that it is going to

00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:25.320
massively cut government
expenditure.

00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:27.850
And what you do, using your
rational expectations that are

00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:29.820
built into your head-- well, you
know the true structural

00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:32.185
form of the equation governing
the economy and the value of

00:45:32.185 --> 00:45:33.520
the coefficients therein.

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:35.540
Big assumption, but put
that to one side.

00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:38.910
You calculate your lifetime
budget and your lifetime

00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:41.870
expenditure in relation to the
fact that 20 years from now,

00:45:41.870 --> 00:45:44.440
because of these state spending
cuts now, you'll pay

00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:46.000
less taxes then.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.850
Thereby, you can retro-dict how
much extra money you've

00:45:48.850 --> 00:45:52.170
got now, and everybody goes
to Ikea and buys a couch.

00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:54.490
And that cures the recession.

00:45:54.490 --> 00:45:56.450
I am not making this shit up.

00:45:56.450 --> 00:45:59.470
Take away all the math, that's
what all these papers say.

00:45:59.470 --> 00:46:01.800
And what we actually see at
the end of it, you got all

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:03.490
these countries cases
that supposedly

00:46:03.490 --> 00:46:04.540
show this in the '80s--

00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:06.990
Ireland, Sweden, Denmark, et
cetera-- and in the book I go

00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:09.190
through them and show that they
do nothing of the kind.

00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:11.000
What actually happens is,
take Canada as the

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.280
greatest example of this--

00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:16.370
the Loonie takes a 40%
devaluation from '76 to '86.

00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:17.730
You're export dependent.

00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:19.240
You're a commodity exporter.

00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:21.690
Your major trading partner who
takes 75% of your exports is

00:46:21.690 --> 00:46:22.740
the United States.

00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:24.440
The United States' economy
is nine times the

00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:25.570
size of your economy.

00:46:25.570 --> 00:46:28.620
You have a 40% devaluation as
the American economy takes off

00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:30.970
like a rocket between
'86 and '92.

00:46:30.970 --> 00:46:32.240
What do you think is
going to happen to

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:33.560
Canada's budget surplus?

00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:34.800
It gets massive.

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:36.720
They cut and then it
led to growth?

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:37.430
No.

00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:39.960
They grew and then they cut.

00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:41.890
Because that's what
your meant to do.

00:46:41.890 --> 00:46:44.990
Austerity date is best done in
the boom, not the slump.

00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:46.980
That's what all these
states actually do.

00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:49.480
Cutting in a slump produces
a bigger slump.

00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:51.400
It's really that simple.

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:53.960
So this is taken up by the
European Central Bank and was

00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:56.130
called the Ecofin Brief
and the G20 finance

00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:57.650
ministers in 2009.

00:46:57.650 --> 00:46:59.040
It's published in
all its glory in

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:01.230
the TCB's 2010 report.

00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:03.890
All the arguments from David
Ricardo, et cetera, and John

00:47:03.890 --> 00:47:07.870
Stuart and Hume and Smith, I'm
not kidding, are in that book.

00:47:07.870 --> 00:47:10.570
I mean, literally, you could
quote them line for line.

00:47:10.570 --> 00:47:13.110
It's exactly the structure of
how they did all the bailouts,

00:47:13.110 --> 00:47:14.950
and how they did all the stuff
in terms of bailing out

00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:16.040
Greece, et cetera.

00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:17.595
And there result of this is what
I call the greatest bait

00:47:17.595 --> 00:47:18.760
and switch in history.

00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:21.190
Because what's actually happened
is all that private

00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:23.050
debt that was generated by the
banking system through

00:47:23.050 --> 00:47:25.390
over-lending is now on the
public balance sheet.

00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:27.950
And to go full circle, all the
way back, that means that

00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:30.130
people like me, who have grown
up on the welfare state just

00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:32.325
now, have to pay for the
mistakes of systemically

00:47:32.325 --> 00:47:34.080
irresponsible bankers.

00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:36.010
Because you can't tax them
themselves because they're too

00:47:36.010 --> 00:47:37.170
politically powerful.

00:47:37.170 --> 00:47:39.420
That's why this is fundamentally
a problem of

00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:42.290
politics, and not a problem
of economics.

00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:43.910
Is there a way out of this?

00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:45.300
People have started to defect.

00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:46.850
The IMF has started to go.

00:47:46.850 --> 00:47:49.080
The IMF has calculated now that,
what happens when you

00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:51.450
cut $1 of public spending
in the periphery?

00:47:51.450 --> 00:47:55.410
You lose $1.5 to $1.7 in
spending, which is why you get

00:47:55.410 --> 00:47:58.100
this wonderful negative
convexity, where it goes, ah,

00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:00.550
which is what's happening
to periphery economies.

00:48:00.550 --> 00:48:02.240
You end up with more
debt, not less.

00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:03.190
The rebel alliance--

00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:05.820
Romania, Estonia, Bulgaria,
Latvia, Lithuania--

00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:08.020
they tried to blow
up the debt star.

00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:08.950
They failed.

00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:10.490
It's been a disaster.

00:48:10.490 --> 00:48:13.480
Excelgate, that's Reinhart
and Rogoff's 90%.

00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:15.320
There really was nothing
there to start with.

00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:17.840
And we have 25% permanent
unemployment in Europe.

00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:20.410
That is not politically
sustainable.

00:48:20.410 --> 00:48:21.960
So where does it all end?

00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:23.710
First one, financial
repression.

00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:25.810
You take those banks that are
heavily levered and filled

00:48:25.810 --> 00:48:27.740
with government bonds and you
fill them with even more

00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:28.870
government bonds.

00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:31.910
Then what you do is lower the
payment on it that you get

00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:33.560
from it, and you lend
to maturity.

00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:35.900
And then what you do is you
run a positive inflation.

00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:37.170
Hence, why central banks
are now moving

00:48:37.170 --> 00:48:38.320
to inflation targets.

00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:39.100
What does that do?

00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:40.800
It creates a negative
real interest rate.

00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:44.330
That cures your debt far better
than any amount of

00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:46.240
cutting, which actually doesn't
work because it's zero

00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:47.510
sum against itself.

00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:48.550
When did we last do this?

00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:49.770
End of World War II.

00:48:49.770 --> 00:48:52.810
The liquidation tax accounted
for the equivalent of 40% of

00:48:52.810 --> 00:48:56.480
American GDP being paid back in
10 years, and the American

00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:58.930
economy boomed at
the same time.

00:48:58.930 --> 00:49:00.470
So there's something very,
very important.

00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:01.840
That's where this
one's heading.

00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:03.110
Who is this bad for?

00:49:03.110 --> 00:49:04.730
This is totally bad
for creditors and

00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:06.030
really good for debtors.

00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:08.850
I just took on the largest
mortgage in human history

00:49:08.850 --> 00:49:11.190
because I fully expect
this to happen.

00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:12.310
I'm bar-belled.

00:49:12.310 --> 00:49:14.970
If the economy recovers, my
asset goes up in value.

00:49:14.970 --> 00:49:16.620
If there's an inflationary
cycle, it eats

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:17.930
away half my mortgage.

00:49:17.930 --> 00:49:18.500
Screw them--

00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:20.400
I've been paying for
their bailouts.

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:21.030
Second one.

00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:22.230
Higher taxes.

00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:23.530
Carried interest exemption.

00:49:23.530 --> 00:49:25.280
Mitt Romney pays 15% tax.

00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:26.230
I pay 30%.

00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:26.740
You pay 30%.

00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:28.190
Do you think that's fair?

00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:28.830
I don't think that's fair.

00:49:28.830 --> 00:49:30.640
I think that's coming
to an end.

00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:32.900
And we're going to shut down
every goddamn tax haven on the

00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:33.440
planet, as well.

00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:35.380
Because you know how much
is hidden there?

00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:38.510
$27 trillion in untaxed
wealth--

00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:39.330
estimate--

00:49:39.330 --> 00:49:41.830
is sitting in five tax havens.

00:49:41.830 --> 00:49:45.170
How many divisions does the
Cayman Islands have?

00:49:45.170 --> 00:49:45.830
None.

00:49:45.830 --> 00:49:46.630
Let's go get it.

00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:49.370
It's so much easier than
slashing the fire brigade.

00:49:49.370 --> 00:49:51.960
And the last one, if you think
about this as payback for the

00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:55.700
bailouts who started it all,
is Hippocratic economics.

00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:57.910
First do no harm.

00:49:57.910 --> 00:50:00.180
The United States was
meant to die.

00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:01.430
We had spent too much.

00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:02.590
We were the profligate.

00:50:02.590 --> 00:50:03.900
We were all going to die.

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:05.785
Remember all those articles
about, oh, it's coming, the

00:50:05.785 --> 00:50:08.480
great end, the great crash,
the whole lot?

00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:09.586
We've de-levered, we've cleaned
up the balance sheets

00:50:09.586 --> 00:50:11.930
of the financial sector, we're
lending again, we've got

00:50:11.930 --> 00:50:12.920
positive growth.

00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:15.310
In three years' time-- we
actually have stabilized the

00:50:15.310 --> 00:50:15.790
debt already.

00:50:15.790 --> 00:50:18.280
In three years, we'll be
effectively reducing it.

00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:21.130
The Brits are in for a
decade of recession.

00:50:21.130 --> 00:50:23.370
Ireland has a lost generation
because they bailed their

00:50:23.370 --> 00:50:25.130
banks and they did austerity.

00:50:25.130 --> 00:50:28.930
Periphery Europe is stuck with
25% permanent unemployment.

00:50:28.930 --> 00:50:30.020
This doesn't work.

00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:32.640
It is a human disaster.

00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:34.220
But most of all,
it's politics.

00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:35.760
Because it's always
about one thing.

00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:39.050
Somebody got all the benefits,
then they cost all the costs,

00:50:39.050 --> 00:50:40.950
now they want somebody to pay
for the costs while they keep

00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:42.210
all the benefits.

00:50:42.210 --> 00:50:44.340
That's what this is
really all about.

00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:46.014
Thank you.

00:50:46.014 --> 00:50:52.986
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:52.986 --> 00:50:55.210
MARK BLYTH: Went on a bit
longer than anticipated,

00:50:55.210 --> 00:50:57.680
despite talking faster
than JFK on speed.

00:50:57.680 --> 00:50:59.810
Sorry about that.

00:50:59.810 --> 00:51:02.290
AUDIENCE: Much as I'd like to
take out a huge mortgage and

00:51:02.290 --> 00:51:04.490
buy stuff, there's something
of a bubble

00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:05.590
going on around here.

00:51:05.590 --> 00:51:09.155
Any other suggestions for how
to take advantage of this?

00:51:09.155 --> 00:51:11.070
MARK BLYTH: Well, as
I switch onto my

00:51:11.070 --> 00:51:13.480
financial adviser mode.

00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:15.850
How do you make money in
a positive inflationary

00:51:15.850 --> 00:51:17.500
environment?

00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:19.480
It's not easy, but it's
not impossible.

00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:21.460
If you have a look at companies
that did really,

00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:26.710
really well in the 1980s, late
'70s, early '80s, they tended

00:51:26.710 --> 00:51:29.110
to be sort of conglomerate
trusts.

00:51:29.110 --> 00:51:30.800
So they owned a little
bit of everything.

00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:33.000
That's like the Abu Dhabi
Investment Corporation, whose

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.740
unofficial slogan is, we own
half a percent of everything

00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:37.850
that isn't nailed down
on the entire planet.

00:51:37.850 --> 00:51:40.040
And the idea behind it is that
you don't know where the

00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:41.490
upside is coming from.

00:51:41.490 --> 00:51:43.220
So what you should be is
maximally diversify.

00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:44.870
It's like an index fund.

00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:47.460
So basically, anything at
all that is internally

00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:50.110
diversified, so buying cut
shares in companies that have

00:51:50.110 --> 00:51:52.140
that type of structure is
probably the best way of

00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:54.580
bar-belling yourself
against them.

00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:57.290
But ultimately, you know,
investing in debt markets is

00:51:57.290 --> 00:51:59.740
probably a bad idea right
at this point.

00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:01.880
But it's still sort of-- at the
end of the day, about this

00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:03.520
paranoia that inflations
lead to

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:05.670
hyperinflations, it's total crap.

00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:08.260
When I went through the book and
did the research on this,

00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:08.710
I wanted to--

00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:09.510
I'm married to--

00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:10.890
background information--

00:52:10.890 --> 00:52:12.570
I'm married into a
bunch of Germans.

00:52:12.570 --> 00:52:14.940
Well, I'm only married to one,
but the whole family comes

00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:17.140
with them, right?

00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:22.500
And my [GERMAN], as I like to
call him, my father-in-law,

00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:24.850
[GERMAN], he's a
classic German.

00:52:24.850 --> 00:52:29.380
He's like 71 years old, he's
retired, and he still saves.

00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:30.590
What the?

00:52:30.590 --> 00:52:31.550
You'll die--

00:52:31.550 --> 00:52:32.500
what are you doing?

00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:32.700
Why?

00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:35.840
He's totally hardwired for
saving, and he's totally

00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:36.920
paranoid about inflation.

00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:39.290
So I went and read a lot about
the German hyperinflation.

00:52:39.290 --> 00:52:41.780
And it was deliberate government
policy to stuff the

00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:43.590
French over reparations.

00:52:43.590 --> 00:52:45.140
I mean, they did it quite
deliberately.

00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:47.600
And the weird about it was after
they did it, it ended in

00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:48.820
eight months.

00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:51.810
And the entire economy was
stabilized within 12.

00:52:51.810 --> 00:52:53.520
And then it grew
for five years.

00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:55.660
And then what actually happened
was austerity,

00:52:55.660 --> 00:52:57.460
through the economy of a cliff,
and that's when the

00:52:57.460 --> 00:52:58.720
Nazis came to power.

00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:02.000
So we have this story about the
least degree of inflation

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.490
leads to some kind of infinity
curve hyper-convexity where,

00:53:05.490 --> 00:53:06.780
boom, off it goes.

00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:08.250
And it's simply not true.

00:53:08.250 --> 00:53:11.180
Post-war Europe ran positive
rates of inflation with

00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:13.530
positive real rates of growth
all the way through the

00:53:13.530 --> 00:53:16.070
postwar period until
about 1980.

00:53:16.070 --> 00:53:18.250
So the inflation
panic is there.

00:53:20.878 --> 00:53:25.220
AUDIENCE: So I've heard Krugman
and others bring up

00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:28.830
Japan as an example to support
these kind of arguments.

00:53:28.830 --> 00:53:31.260
Can you just talk a bit about
how they're able to run a high

00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:33.830
debt for so long and things
don't seem to--

00:53:33.830 --> 00:53:34.340
MARK BLYTH: Sure, sure.

00:53:34.340 --> 00:53:35.200
Absolutely.

00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:37.150
I actually think these guys
are wrong about Japan.

00:53:37.150 --> 00:53:39.650
I think what goes on in Japan is
actually deeply structural.

00:53:39.650 --> 00:53:42.110
There is a wonderful book by
guy called Sven Steinmo,

00:53:42.110 --> 00:53:44.160
called "The Evolution of the
Modern State." And he has a

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:45.180
chapter on Japan.

00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:46.950
And if you ever wanted to read,
I think, the definitive

00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:48.350
story on Japan, this is it.

00:53:48.350 --> 00:53:51.180
He spent two years there on an
Abe fellowship and had access

00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:52.180
to all the people.

00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:52.725
Well, it was two books.

00:53:52.725 --> 00:53:55.310
It was Richard Koo's "Holy Grail
of Macroeconomics." So

00:53:55.310 --> 00:53:57.920
basically what happens is Japan
goes through a balance

00:53:57.920 --> 00:53:58.410
sheet recession.

00:53:58.410 --> 00:54:00.430
What's a balance sheet
recession?

00:54:00.430 --> 00:54:03.190
Basically, your companies are
de-levering but don't want to

00:54:03.190 --> 00:54:04.376
tell anyone because
if they do, there

00:54:04.376 --> 00:54:05.990
will be a run on them.

00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:08.160
And everybody's complicit
together because they've all

00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:08.950
over borrowed.

00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:12.460
So basically, you have this
kind of slow bleeding that

00:54:12.460 --> 00:54:15.140
goes on as it's sort of
monetized by the central bank,

00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:16.490
and it ends up in debt.

00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:17.580
So you're not growing.

00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:20.840
And that's sort of the obvious
part of the story.

00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:22.860
The less obvious part of the
story goes like this.

00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:24.070
Go back to 1986.

00:54:24.070 --> 00:54:25.050
There's a thing called
the Plaza Accord.

00:54:25.050 --> 00:54:27.305
The Plaza Accord was when the
United States turns around to

00:54:27.305 --> 00:54:29.450
its two major trading partners,
Japan and then West

00:54:29.450 --> 00:54:33.970
Germany, and said, our exchange
rate is too high.

00:54:33.970 --> 00:54:37.180
People are buying dollars, we're
doing well just now.

00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:38.360
And it's killing our exports.

00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:39.140
You guys are wiping us out.

00:54:39.140 --> 00:54:41.300
Remember the whole paranoia
about Japan that went on?

00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:42.780
They were going to take over
the world, all that.

00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:45.450
You ever see the film, "Rising
Sun," Michael Crichton?

00:54:45.450 --> 00:54:48.995
Possibly the most racist film
ever made in human history,

00:54:48.995 --> 00:54:49.900
but put that to one side.

00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:51.260
So Japan's going to take
everything over, blah, blah,

00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:52.680
blah, the rest of it.

00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:55.030
And then, of course, what
actually happens is they do

00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:56.800
the exchange rate thing, the
United States exchange rate

00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:59.210
goes down, the German one and
the Japanese one goes up.

00:54:59.210 --> 00:55:01.450
Now, the Japanese economy is
entirely export dependent.

00:55:01.450 --> 00:55:03.720
It's sort of like Germany
on steroids.

00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:05.850
So what they do is they move the
plant and equipment from

00:55:05.850 --> 00:55:08.900
the Japanese home islands out
to the second tier tigers.

00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:11.430
So you start to get investment
in Vietnam, Malaysia, all

00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:13.780
these places, and they move
the entire thing with the

00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:15.420
supplier networks,
the whole lot.

00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:17.190
Well, the way that the Japanese
welfare state was

00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:19.460
constructed, it was all
in-house to the firm.

00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:21.170
It was meant to be cradle
to grave, but the firm

00:55:21.170 --> 00:55:22.120
took care of you.

00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:24.460
Well, the firm has just broken
the social contract.

00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:25.970
So how did people protect
themselves?

00:55:25.970 --> 00:55:28.140
They wanted another asset they
could have that would have a

00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:30.480
positive upside, that would
retain its value, and they

00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:31.680
could sell it in their
retirement.

00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:33.580
What did they buy en masse?

00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:34.460
Real estate.

00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:36.400
So you get a giant real
estate bubble.

00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:38.860
The real estate bubble gets so
out of control that it popped

00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:40.830
and the banking system
can't support it.

00:55:40.830 --> 00:55:43.240
That collapses and that
starts the recession.

00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:46.020
But the important part is
the sociological story.

00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:48.050
You've got a cultural and
generational shift.

00:55:48.050 --> 00:55:51.140
Because you've got a very old
population who are now 45

00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:53.130
years old, facing unemployment,
with a very,

00:55:53.130 --> 00:55:55.270
very narrow safety net
for the first time.

00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:57.330
So what do they do when the
government gives them money to

00:55:57.330 --> 00:55:59.880
spend to stimulate
the economy?

00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:01.830
They stick it under
the mattress.

00:56:01.830 --> 00:56:02.830
It doesn't go anywhere.

00:56:02.830 --> 00:56:03.790
It gets hoarded.

00:56:03.790 --> 00:56:05.340
So the savings rate goes up.

00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:06.520
And where do they
put the savings?

00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:08.170
In the post office account
and in the bank account.

00:56:08.170 --> 00:56:10.120
And what do the bank and the
post office do with it?

00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:11.660
They buy government bonds.

00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:13.440
So that's why you end
up with this massive

00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:14.720
extension in debt.

00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:17.380
Now, the thing is, the Japanese
propensity to consume

00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:19.510
is really, really low,
particularly the higher up the

00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:20.880
demographic you get.

00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:23.690
So 80-year-olds are not just
buying bonds and then

00:56:23.690 --> 00:56:25.660
liquidating them in retirement,
they're actually

00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:28.850
keeping them whole and handing
them onto the next generation.

00:56:28.850 --> 00:56:31.370
So you've got an
inter-generational debt

00:56:31.370 --> 00:56:32.830
transfer going on.

00:56:32.830 --> 00:56:36.890
So the story that basically it's
just a monetary policy

00:56:36.890 --> 00:56:39.460
story in, you know, Japan,
I think that's wrong.

00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:41.445
I think there's actually a
deeply structural problem

00:56:41.445 --> 00:56:43.240
that's going on there, and it
goes all the way back to the

00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:44.280
Plaza Accord.

00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:47.200
So that's my short version of
Sven Steinmo's argument, but I

00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:48.836
find it quite convincing.

00:56:48.836 --> 00:56:51.325
AUDIENCE: How can an individual
state in the EU,

00:56:51.325 --> 00:56:54.150
like Ireland or something, try
to fix things for itself with

00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:55.580
all the constraints under it?

00:56:55.580 --> 00:56:56.600
MARK BLYTH: They can't.

00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:58.800
Look, and it's good.

00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:00.050
Because you're in the Euro.

00:57:00.050 --> 00:57:01.780
So once you're in the
Euro, it's a kind

00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:03.110
of a one-time game.

00:57:03.110 --> 00:57:05.340
Because the problem was if
you're Argentina and you tie

00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:08.046
yourself to the dollar, as they
did back in the day, back

00:57:08.046 --> 00:57:11.690
in the late 1990s into 2000, and
then you have the default.

00:57:11.690 --> 00:57:14.470
And they had a default because
Argentina is the graveyard of

00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:16.410
all bad economic policies
gone wrong, there's

00:57:16.410 --> 00:57:17.410
no doubt about that.

00:57:17.410 --> 00:57:19.900
But also because their major
trading partner is Brazil.

00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:22.830
And basically, the Real had a
40% exchange rate gain, and

00:57:22.830 --> 00:57:24.890
basically it screwed up all
their exports and the whole

00:57:24.890 --> 00:57:25.510
thing fell down.

00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:28.740
Now, because they were just on a
peg, they actually still had

00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:30.170
their own domestic currency.

00:57:30.170 --> 00:57:32.320
So they could go, to
hell with the peg.

00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:33.110
We've still got it.

00:57:33.110 --> 00:57:35.070
And then you lock up the banks
and people bang on the doors

00:57:35.070 --> 00:57:35.940
and all that sort of stuff.

00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:37.710
But you still have
your currency.

00:57:37.710 --> 00:57:40.500
Ireland doesn't have
a pound anymore.

00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:43.820
I mean, literally, the bits
of paper don't exist.

00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:45.600
So if you were going to
get out of the Euro--

00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:46.770
just think about the complexity

00:57:46.770 --> 00:57:47.790
of this for a second--

00:57:47.790 --> 00:57:50.840
you would have to kind
of freeze time.

00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:53.670
Everybody freezes, some kind
of government agency with a

00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:55.750
time machine would freeze time,
you'd go around, you'd

00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:58.770
vacuum up all the bills out of
everybody's wallets, the whole

00:57:58.770 --> 00:58:00.665
lot, and you'd stamp them all
and reissue them the new

00:58:00.665 --> 00:58:03.010
currency, and then you'd
unfreeze time.

00:58:03.010 --> 00:58:05.090
And then you would have
an economic crisis.

00:58:05.090 --> 00:58:08.830
So just that alone adds a level
of complexity to it

00:58:08.830 --> 00:58:11.450
which makes it just incredibly
difficult.

00:58:11.450 --> 00:58:14.250
Bigger countries like France
and Italy can do this.

00:58:14.250 --> 00:58:16.830
The Italian economy, North
Italy, is actually globally

00:58:16.830 --> 00:58:19.200
competitive, totally solvent,
the whole lot.

00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:21.040
The south is a basket case.

00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:22.330
It's a bit like the north and
south of the United States.

00:58:22.330 --> 00:58:23.080
Shh.

00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:24.170
Anyway.

00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:26.260
But you get transfers across
the region, that's

00:58:26.260 --> 00:58:27.330
what keeps it going.

00:58:27.330 --> 00:58:30.580
The problem is Greece has
nothing to export.

00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:31.280
It really doesn't.

00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:32.250
It has olive oil.

00:58:32.250 --> 00:58:34.290
But so does Italy, and they
can make more of it.

00:58:34.290 --> 00:58:36.440
Spain makes even more of that.

00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:38.020
Do you know when you buy
your EVOO and it says,

00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:39.020
Italian olive oil?

00:58:39.020 --> 00:58:40.880
It's actually Spanish olives
they've bought and they

00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:42.800
brought to Italy and then they
grind them and call it

00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:44.010
Italian olive oil.

00:58:44.010 --> 00:58:46.530
So that's all zero sum
against itself.

00:58:46.530 --> 00:58:49.230
So if you don't have something
to export, then the

00:58:49.230 --> 00:58:51.850
devaluation thing that you'll
get won't benefit you because

00:58:51.850 --> 00:58:52.520
you don't have anything.

00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:55.580
And all you'll do is end up with
hyperinflation because

00:58:55.580 --> 00:58:58.690
your imports become so
incredibly expensive.

00:58:58.690 --> 00:59:02.535
So Ireland, Greece, Portugal,
they are stuck because they've

00:59:02.535 --> 00:59:04.080
got nothing to sell.

00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:04.770
That's it.

00:59:04.770 --> 00:59:06.660
So they're kind of trapped
in this worst of

00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:07.960
all possible worlds.

00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:11.070
Ireland is really screwed
for a whole generation.

00:59:11.070 --> 00:59:13.000
The debt to GDP figures
you see in Ireland

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:14.250
are a big, fat lie.

00:59:14.250 --> 00:59:17.080
Because they basically book
services exports from this

00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:19.280
company as exports.

00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:21.630
So basically, the profits
from this farm go to

00:59:21.630 --> 00:59:22.700
an office in Dublin.

00:59:22.700 --> 00:59:24.500
Has anybody ever been to
the office in Dublin?

00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:25.220
No?

00:59:25.220 --> 00:59:27.380
There's about 25 people
who work there.

00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:29.620
And your entire corporate
profits get declared through

00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:32.150
them, because you only
pay 12.5% tax.

00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:35.980
So that 12.5% gets booked as an
Irish services export and

00:59:35.980 --> 00:59:37.930
appears in their balance
of payments.

00:59:37.930 --> 00:59:38.970
Well, it's complete paper.

00:59:38.970 --> 00:59:39.510
It's nothing.

00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:41.040
It's complete garbage.

00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:43.350
And they also have all the bad
assets from their banks that

00:59:43.350 --> 00:59:45.720
blew up and this thing called
NAMA, which is a super bad

00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:47.570
bank, and that's never
coming back.

00:59:47.570 --> 00:59:49.070
And that's off balance sheet.

00:59:49.070 --> 00:59:51.240
So when you add it all together,
Ireland is actually

00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:52.766
worse than Greece.

00:59:52.766 --> 00:59:53.520
Shh.

00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:54.545
Just don't tell the Irish.

00:59:54.545 --> 00:59:56.500
AUDIENCE: Speaking of people,
what do you think about

00:59:56.500 --> 00:59:59.690
Iceland, how they dealt
with their financial?

00:59:59.690 --> 01:00:01.670
MARK BLYTH: Iceland is a
brilliant example of no good

01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:02.920
deed goes unpunished.

01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:07.233
So when I started all this off,
I was a member of this

01:00:07.233 --> 01:00:09.710
thing called the Warwick
Commission on Financial Form.

01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:12.420
And you know, the crisis
happens, and people are like,

01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:13.530
it's the shadow banks.

01:00:13.530 --> 01:00:15.130
And I'm like, what's
a shadow bank?

01:00:15.130 --> 01:00:16.400
I mean, you need to
do a little bit

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:17.870
of catch-up on this.

01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:19.680
So at first, I bought
the whole narrative

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:20.560
of too big to fail.

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:22.510
Systemic interconnections, the
rest, the whole lot, blah,

01:00:22.510 --> 01:00:23.460
blah, blah, blah.

01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:26.160
And by the time I finished the
book, I said, no, I actually

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:27.240
totally don't buy this--

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:28.506
I think we should have
let them fail.

01:00:28.506 --> 01:00:30.840
Oh, but what about systemic
risk, all the rest of it?

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:33.910
Well, I know what lost GDP is,
I know how much unemployments

01:00:33.910 --> 01:00:34.940
cost, I know all that.

01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:37.260
I know the real costs
of not bailing them.

01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:39.370
And more to the point, the
banking system, even though

01:00:39.370 --> 01:00:41.883
it's de-levered, is actually
more concentrated now than it

01:00:41.883 --> 01:00:43.190
was in 2007.

01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:46.250
So Citibank is even too
bigger to fail.

01:00:46.250 --> 01:00:49.470
And the European system
is that on steroids.

01:00:49.470 --> 01:00:51.910
So you've basically given
someone not just a banking

01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:54.160
license with a subsidy,
an extortion

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:55.980
racket on the taxpayer.

01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:58.450
And that's just, it is
literally criminal.

01:00:58.450 --> 01:00:59.560
Best example of this--

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:00.620
UBS.

01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:04.760
Fined $1.2 billion a few
months back for doing

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:08.220
terrorism financing and money
laundering with drug dealers.

01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:11.510
Now, if you or I did this,
we would be in the jail.

01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:12.690
They get a fine.

01:01:12.690 --> 01:01:14.210
Why do they get a fine?

01:01:14.210 --> 01:01:16.910
Because if you are an investor
in an American or

01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:18.770
American-licensed broker/dealer
entity--

01:01:18.770 --> 01:01:20.710
a big bank--

01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:23.340
and one of your corporate
officers is charged with a

01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:26.880
criminal liability, you are
under legal obligation to

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:28.790
withdraw your investments.

01:01:28.790 --> 01:01:31.460
So if UBS is actually criminally
charged, or their

01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:32.555
senior officers are charged.

01:01:32.555 --> 01:01:35.870
And then CalPERS has to
pull the money out.

01:01:35.870 --> 01:01:37.890
If CalPERS pulls the money out
along with everybody else,

01:01:37.890 --> 01:01:41.120
what happens to that bank?

01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:42.740
So what happens to the system?

01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:45.870
So you're basically playing
systemic moral hazard as a

01:01:45.870 --> 01:01:46.940
business model.

01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:48.670
This is screwed up
beyond belief.

01:01:48.670 --> 01:01:50.830
So Iceland, to finish
this one, basically

01:01:50.830 --> 01:01:52.450
let their banks fail.

01:01:52.450 --> 01:01:54.290
Now, a lot of the debt, most
of the debt was externally

01:01:54.290 --> 01:01:55.680
held, so the cost of that
went on to others.

01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:57.490
But here's the interesting
part of the story.

01:01:57.490 --> 01:02:00.000
All of the super geniuses who
were working in the banks

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.160
engineering derivatives now
had to get a real job.

01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:05.340
So what happened was the
domestic economy, the real

01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:08.000
economy, rebounded, because all
these start-ups happened.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.740
Because all these really bright
people went, shit, I

01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:10.990
need something else to do.

01:02:10.990 --> 01:02:13.000
So they started doing all these
new businesses which

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.410
didn't appear before.

01:02:14.410 --> 01:02:17.260
They became a huge hub for
online gaming, because you can

01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:18.170
stick the servers
in the ground--

01:02:18.170 --> 01:02:19.460
and it's bloody cold--

01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:21.180
and you've got all the people
with the math skills who can

01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:23.770
do the software engineering and
make the whole thing work.

01:02:23.770 --> 01:02:25.870
So there were all of these
positive externalities of

01:02:25.870 --> 01:02:27.100
actually letting them fail.

01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:30.140
Their unemployment level is
now about one point higher

01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:31.480
than Germany .

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:34.330
Compare it with Iceland, which
is 14% on the official rate,

01:02:34.330 --> 01:02:36.580
and that's with migration
going out.

01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:38.910
So the people who did this, the
government that came in

01:02:38.910 --> 01:02:41.700
and basically allowed this to
happen, it's been a bit tough.

01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:43.970
They actually do things like
pay back the debt and are

01:02:43.970 --> 01:02:44.840
fiscally responsible.

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:47.260
So they've just been voted out,
and the people who blew

01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:49.630
up the banks in the first place
are now back in power.

01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:52.856
No good deed goes unpunished.

01:02:52.856 --> 01:02:55.190
AUDIENCE: I don't know if you're
familiar with what

01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:55.910
happened in Australia.

01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:57.640
I'm from Australia.

01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:01.150
But people have largely missed
the financial crisis.

01:03:01.150 --> 01:03:02.570
And there are two
stories running.

01:03:02.570 --> 01:03:06.245
And I don't know if you know
which one is the--

01:03:06.245 --> 01:03:07.430
anyway, they're competing.

01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:10.410
One is saying that, well, the
government did spending and

01:03:10.410 --> 01:03:11.390
gave people money.

01:03:11.390 --> 01:03:12.160
And they spent it.

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:13.650
And that saved the economy.

01:03:13.650 --> 01:03:15.680
And the other story running
is that, no,

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:16.870
it's the mining boom.

01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:18.240
We just dig everything
up, sell it to

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:19.560
China, China went well.

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:21.035
And it has nothing to do with
what the government did.

01:03:21.035 --> 01:03:22.231
Have you got a view on that?

01:03:22.231 --> 01:03:24.640
MARK BLYTH: The second one
is completely right.

01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:27.790
And the way you can see this is
you can't trade the Chinese

01:03:27.790 --> 01:03:31.920
currency easily, because of
capital controls, et cetera.

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:34.660
But what you can do is basically
look at the shadow

01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:36.650
markets on the Chinese
currency versus

01:03:36.650 --> 01:03:37.650
the Australian dollar.

01:03:37.650 --> 01:03:40.061
And they move like this.

01:03:40.061 --> 01:03:42.130
And it is because, basically,
Australia

01:03:42.130 --> 01:03:43.460
literally is owned by China.

01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:44.900
I mean, people say this about
the United States.

01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:46.320
Oh, China owns the USA.

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:48.880
And it's like, well look, only
17% of bills are actually

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:49.610
owned by China.

01:03:49.610 --> 01:03:50.200
And it's brilliant.

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:52.660
Because for the past 30 years,
we've been giving them bits of

01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:54.520
paper that bear 2% net.

01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:56.070
And they've been giving
us televisions.

01:03:56.070 --> 01:03:57.040
It's a sweet deal.

01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:59.440
I don't know why anybody would
ever want to end it.

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:01.330
It's brilliant for us.

01:04:01.330 --> 01:04:02.450
The Australian one is the
other way around.

01:04:02.450 --> 01:04:05.590
They actually do own your
assets completely.

01:04:05.590 --> 01:04:07.730
Because if it wasn't for the
western Australian mining

01:04:07.730 --> 01:04:09.540
boom, and just all the
commodities they're sucking

01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:12.170
out at the peak of a commodity
cycle, I mean, do you really

01:04:12.170 --> 01:04:13.900
think a house in Perth
would cost 2

01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:16.210
million Australian dollars?

01:04:16.210 --> 01:04:17.070
And it does.

01:04:17.070 --> 01:04:17.920
It's totally that.

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:19.380
It's totally the mining boom.

01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:21.680
So what that means is either the
commodity cycle peaks or

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:24.140
China slows down, Australia
is in serious trouble.

01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:26.320
Now, the price to income
multiples in

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:29.250
Sydney are 13 to 1.

01:04:29.250 --> 01:04:32.960
So you need to marry two people
and have family money

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:34.730
in order to get a house.

01:04:34.730 --> 01:04:37.650
So it's not 3 times your income,
it's 13 times your

01:04:37.650 --> 01:04:40.890
income for a three bedroom flat
in a nice part of Sydney.

01:04:40.890 --> 01:04:43.610
That's a colossal housing
bubble, and it's Chinese

01:04:43.610 --> 01:04:44.885
liquidity that's pumping it.

01:04:44.885 --> 01:04:47.300
If that every goes away, boom.

01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:48.700
AUDIENCE: The housing bubble
has never crashed in

01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:49.690
Australia, unlike
everywhere else.

01:04:49.690 --> 01:04:50.345
MARK BLYTH: Yeah, absolutely.

01:04:50.345 --> 01:04:50.611
And you know what?

01:04:50.611 --> 01:04:51.890
All bubbles pop.

01:04:51.890 --> 01:04:53.580
It is just a question of time.

01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:55.120
AUDIENCE: I was hoping you could
talk a little bit about

01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:57.140
the BRIC countries, and
especially what Brazil needs

01:04:57.140 --> 01:04:58.750
to be doing.

01:04:58.750 --> 01:05:01.010
MARK BLYTH: Brazil needs to do
what Brazil's been doing,

01:05:01.010 --> 01:05:02.590
which is awesome.

01:05:02.590 --> 01:05:05.940
So quite primer on the Brazilian
political economy.

01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:07.640
For years and years and years
they had one of the highest

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:08.546
Gini coefficients
in the world.

01:05:08.546 --> 01:05:09.790
They were incredibly unequal.

01:05:09.790 --> 01:05:12.060
And they had a problem because
wealth being so concentrated

01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:14.500
meant that the people who make
effective investment decisions

01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:16.940
decided that their own economy
was too risky, because it

01:05:16.940 --> 01:05:18.570
would either be run by the
military or run by the

01:05:18.570 --> 01:05:20.170
communists or run out of town.

01:05:20.170 --> 01:05:21.880
So they would take their money
and they would put it in

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:23.135
Citibank, which is
nice and secure.

01:05:23.135 --> 01:05:25.190
And you got a lesser rate of
return, but you don't mind

01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:26.670
because you own everything,
anyway.

01:05:26.670 --> 01:05:28.673
So that's the way it went on for
years and years, until it

01:05:28.673 --> 01:05:30.960
got to a point where basically
you had to spend so much money

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:34.960
on private kidnap insurance and
mining your house against

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:37.270
the people who would try and
kill you, that they did a deal

01:05:37.270 --> 01:05:38.680
with a guy called Lula.

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:40.240
Lula u to run the
Worker's Party.

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:42.510
So the guy who ran the Worker's
Party, the lefty guy,

01:05:42.510 --> 01:05:44.440
comes in and basically does
exactly as I said on the

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:45.600
bottom of that slide.

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:48.640
Democracy is asset insurance for
the rich-- stop skimping

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:49.680
on the payments.

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:52.950
So did this strategy whereby
they got BNDES, the Brazilian

01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:55.460
National Development Bank,
to bank-- their lending

01:05:55.460 --> 01:05:57.130
portfolio, by the way,
is twice the size

01:05:57.130 --> 01:05:58.230
of the World Bank--

01:05:58.230 --> 01:06:01.110
to subsidize domestic
corporations so that they

01:06:01.110 --> 01:06:02.650
could multinational.

01:06:02.650 --> 01:06:05.890
So you've got companies like
Embraer, the aircraft company,

01:06:05.890 --> 01:06:07.420
the big cement company, and
the others, that are now

01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:09.270
globally successful
corporations.

01:06:09.270 --> 01:06:11.920
Because of that expansion,
bankrolled by the development

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:14.300
bank, what they do is they tax
the companies on their

01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:16.550
earnings abroad, bring that
back in, and they set up

01:06:16.550 --> 01:06:18.670
something called Bolsa Familia,
which is the welfare

01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:20.150
state that Brazil never had.

01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:22.690
This has squeezed the income
distribution like this at the

01:06:22.690 --> 01:06:25.130
same time as it has gone up,
which enables the Brazilians

01:06:25.130 --> 01:06:26.810
to finally build
a middle class.

01:06:26.810 --> 01:06:28.200
It empowers the middle class.

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:30.960
And it dis-empowers the
durational land-owning elites.

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:32.430
So what you end up with--

01:06:32.430 --> 01:06:34.880
there's a little fixey-do with
domestically high interest

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:36.280
rates to keep these
guys happy.

01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:38.045
Well, what you've actually
done is to engineer is to

01:06:38.045 --> 01:06:40.510
engineer a kind of new
developmental welfare state,

01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:42.890
which has actually been great
for Brazilian growth and has

01:06:42.890 --> 01:06:44.650
actually brought down the
Gini coefficient.

01:06:44.650 --> 01:06:46.930
Because of this, everybody wants
to buy Brazilian assets,

01:06:46.930 --> 01:06:48.220
which is why the Real
is going up.

01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:50.250
And they're export-dependent,
so they're freaking out.

01:06:50.250 --> 01:06:52.330
So what they've done is they've
put inward capital

01:06:52.330 --> 01:06:54.200
controls on inward investment.

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:56.560
And usually, the big fear is
you put your money in, they

01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:58.260
put up capital controls, you
can't get it out, it's

01:06:58.260 --> 01:06:59.370
expropriation.

01:06:59.370 --> 01:07:00.370
They're doing it totally
different.

01:07:00.370 --> 01:07:01.540
They're like, you want
to come here?

01:07:01.540 --> 01:07:02.300
Dead easy.

01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:04.540
Pay a transactions tax
and a deposit.

01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:06.510
Because if you're not coming in
for the long term, forget

01:07:06.510 --> 01:07:08.550
about sitting here earning
high interest rates just

01:07:08.550 --> 01:07:09.520
because you can.

01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:11.990
So they're making it difficult
for that money to come in.

01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:14.980
But as a growth node in a big
country, it is happening

01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:15.280
nonetheless.

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:17.910
So the Real is going up, the
economy is slowing down.

01:07:17.910 --> 01:07:19.615
But what they've done over the
past 10 years, I think, is

01:07:19.615 --> 01:07:20.865
nothing short of remarkable.

01:07:23.470 --> 01:07:24.670
BORIS DEBIC: Thank you, Mark.

01:07:24.670 --> 01:07:29.930
[APPLAUSE]
