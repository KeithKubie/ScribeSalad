the 1980s we've had this dramatic

00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:12.840
the 1980s we've had this dramatic
 

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:16.580
the 1980s we've had this dramatic
increase in incarceration and the number

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:16.590
increase in incarceration and the number
 

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:19.340
increase in incarceration and the number
of young men who are swept up black men

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:19.350
of young men who are swept up black men
 

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:22.370
of young men who are swept up black men
who are swept up in the in the system of

who are swept up in the in the system of
 

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:25.610

slaves and 1850 yeah yeah you know and
 

00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:32.630
slaves and 1850 yeah yeah you know and
obviously our population was a lot

00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:32.640
obviously our population was a lot
 

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.790
obviously our population was a lot
sicker than of course but it still is a

00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:34.800
sicker than of course but it still is a
 

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.700
sicker than of course but it still is a
stunning figure you know I think the

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:37.710
stunning figure you know I think the
 

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:40.310
stunning figure you know I think the
reality is this is a demographic in our

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320
reality is this is a demographic in our
 

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:43.490
reality is this is a demographic in our
country a group of Americans who went

country a group of Americans who went
through a lot of tough times of course

00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:45.060
through a lot of tough times of course
 

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:47.810
through a lot of tough times of course

slavery through Jim Crow and in the
subsequent impacts and then around the

subsequent impacts and then around the
 

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:54.890
subsequent impacts and then around the
1970s we just sort of told these guys to

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:54.900
1970s we just sort of told these guys to
 

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:56.840
1970s we just sort of told these guys to
figure it out right you know in the 200

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:56.850
figure it out right you know in the 200
 

00:28:56.850 --> 00:29:02.570
figure it out right you know in the 200
years of systemic disinvestment and

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:02.580
years of systemic disinvestment and
 

00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:04.880

it seems to me that one of the major

it seems to me that one of the major

that tension between individualism and

00:42:27.490 --> 00:42:27.500
that tension between individualism and
 

00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:30.800
that tension between individualism and
community and the idea that we are all

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:30.810
community and the idea that we are all
 

00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:35.900
community and the idea that we are all
in this together that we sink or fall we

00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:35.910
in this together that we sink or fall we
 

00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:42.220
in this together that we sink or fall we
sink or we drown we survive together and

00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:42.230
sink or we drown we survive together and
 

00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:45.410
sink or we drown we survive together and
it seems to me that that is very much

00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:45.420
it seems to me that that is very much
 

00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:49.430
it seems to me that that is very much
related to at least our moral

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440
related to at least our moral
 

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:52.790
related to at least our moral
commitments if not our faith commitments

00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800
commitments if not our faith commitments
 

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:56.800
commitments if not our faith commitments
and I wonder if you have a sense that a

00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:56.810
and I wonder if you have a sense that a
 

00:42:56.810 --> 00:43:01.130
and I wonder if you have a sense that a
concern with those sorts of issues rise

00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:01.140
concern with those sorts of issues rise
 

00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:04.310
concern with those sorts of issues rise
at all up in the discourse in Washington

00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:04.320
at all up in the discourse in Washington
 

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:08.380
at all up in the discourse in Washington
it's a great question and you know

00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:08.390
it's a great question and you know
 

00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:10.730
it's a great question and you know
reflect on that a bit if you don't mind

00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:10.740
reflect on that a bit if you don't mind
 

00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:12.410
reflect on that a bit if you don't mind
just might my very brief thoughts are

00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:12.420
just might my very brief thoughts are
 

00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:15.349
just might my very brief thoughts are
that is that that sense that we rise or

00:43:15.349 --> 00:43:15.359
that is that that sense that we rise or
 

00:43:15.359 --> 00:43:19.700
that is that that sense that we rise or
fall together is very much a part of the

00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:19.710
fall together is very much a part of the
 

00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:23.740
fall together is very much a part of the
the holiest texts of most faiths as well

00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:23.750
the holiest texts of most faiths as well
 

00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:27.680
the holiest texts of most faiths as well
you know notion of community of of

00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:27.690
you know notion of community of of
 

00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:30.650
you know notion of community of of
sacrificing for one another

00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:30.660
sacrificing for one another
 

00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:33.550
sacrificing for one another
and so I think it's woven into our

00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:33.560
and so I think it's woven into our
 

00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:36.859
and so I think it's woven into our
religious discourse no one has spoken

00:43:36.859 --> 00:43:36.869
religious discourse no one has spoken
 

00:43:36.869 --> 00:43:38.810
religious discourse no one has spoken
more eloquently to these issues than Bob

00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:38.820
more eloquently to these issues than Bob
 

00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:43.400
more eloquently to these issues than Bob
putting them right here I have some

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:43.410
putting them right here I have some
 

00:43:43.410 --> 00:43:45.710
putting them right here I have some
concern yeah I think the tension you

00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:45.720
concern yeah I think the tension you
 

00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:48.560
concern yeah I think the tension you
described is right I have some concern

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:48.570
described is right I have some concern
 

00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:50.230
described is right I have some concern
that that tension is being politicized

00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:50.240
that that tension is being politicized
 

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:53.240
that that tension is being politicized
so that the right sees itself as the

00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:53.250
so that the right sees itself as the
 

00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:55.130
so that the right sees itself as the
holding up the banner of individualism

00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:55.140
holding up the banner of individualism
 

00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:56.930
holding up the banner of individualism
and the left sees itself holding up the

00:43:56.930 --> 00:43:56.940
and the left sees itself holding up the
 

00:43:56.940 --> 00:43:59.060
and the left sees itself holding up the
banner of community and people on the

00:43:59.060 --> 00:43:59.070
banner of community and people on the
 

00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:00.320
banner of community and people on the
right don't think they can support

00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:00.330
right don't think they can support
 

00:44:00.330 --> 00:44:01.820
right don't think they can support
community because that's the other side

00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:01.830
community because that's the other side
 

00:44:01.830 --> 00:44:04.940
community because that's the other side
and it does seem to make it's much more

00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:04.950
and it does seem to make it's much more
 

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:05.850
and it does seem to make it's much more
difficult

00:44:05.850 --> 00:44:05.860
difficult
