00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.720
A couple of videos ago we
figured out how to go from the

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:12.770
empirical formula to the
mass composition.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.710
And all I mean by that, mass
composition, is that you could

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.480
start with the empirical formula
H2O, which is also its

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.670
molecular formula.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.600
And then we were able to figure
out what percentage of

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.750
this was water and what

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.170
percentage of this was hydrogen.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:32.299
The way we did it is we said,
OK, oxygen's mass is 16 atomic

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.930
mass units.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.630
Hydrogen is one.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.840
The mass of the entire molecule
is 2 times hydrogen.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.520
2 times 1.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.910
Plus 16 for that one
oxygen, so it's 18.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.490
And then we said, the
composition of

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.600
oxygen is just 16/18.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.720
So oxygen is 16/18.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.610
I don't have my calculator
anymore.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.710
I think the number was something
on the order of 88%

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.030
or 88.9% oxygen.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.550
So now let's see if we
can go the other way.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.710
Let's see if we could start
with mass composition, the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.170
percent composition of the
different elements, and then

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.520
go to empirical formula.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.140
And I think the first
video I made, I

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.860
spelled empirical wrong.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.740
Which is good reason for me
not to do spelling videos.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.790
I think I spelled this with
an e right here, because I

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.080
pronounce it empricial.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.680
But it's spelled with an i.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.920
Empirical formula.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.605
So back to the empirical
formula.

00:01:31.605 --> 00:01:35.620
So let's do some exercises
here to see

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.260
if we can get someplace.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.180
So let's say that I start off
with-- I need space, my

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.370
periodic table is right
down there.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:47.940
Let's say I am told that
I have a bag of stuff.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:58.030
And 75% of that bag, let's
say it is mercury.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.420
Hg.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.500
And say that the other 25%
of the bag is chlorine.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.810
So the question that I'm asked
is, what is the empirical

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.280
formula of the stuff that I have
here, assuming that it's

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.400
all one molecule or one
type of molecule?

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.265
So what is the empirical
formula?

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.430
So the way to think about this
is, let's assume that you have

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.400
100 grams of this stuff.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.740
Right?

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.680
And the reason why I'm picking
100 is because 100 is a useful

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.570
number to deal with.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.930
So if I have 100 grams of
the stuff, all right.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:51.560
So let's say I assume that you
have 100 grams. If you have

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.230
100 grams, how many grams
of mercury do you have?

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.840
Well that means that 75% of
that, that means you have 75

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.790
grams of mercury, Hg.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:11.880
And that means you have
25 grams of chlorine.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.890
You might be saying, where did
get these numbers from?

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.750
Well, I got the numbers because
I assumed 100 grams. I

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.490
could have assumed 112 grams
or 7 grams, but those would

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.180
have been harder numbers
to work with.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.610
So I'm just assuming 100 grams.
So the question is, in

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.930
75 grams of mercury, how many
moles of mercury do I have?

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.830
So I need to convert from
grams to moles.

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:34.590
Let's go the other way.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.670
One mole of mercury-- this is at
least how my brain thinks--

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:46.990
let me pick a suitable color--
so one mole of mercury so 6.02

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.360
times 10 to the 23
mercury atoms.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.400
What's the mass of that?

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.810
Well it's equal to whatever
mercury's mass number is in

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.220
grams. So let's go look up
mercury's mass number.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.910
So mercury is a transition
metal.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.980
It's one of the few metals
that are liquid at room

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.740
temperature.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.780
Right there we have mercury.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.596
Its mass number, let's
pick the 200.

00:04:14.596 --> 00:04:17.490
It has a mass number of 200.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.700
Obviously, there's some mercury
out there that has a

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:20.950
mass of 201.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:27.710
But for simplicity, let's
say it's 200.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:34.450
So 1 mole of mercury is 200
grams. How did I get that?

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:35.530
Mercury's mass number.

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:41.160
One atom of mercury has a mass
of 200 atomic mass units.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.690
So one mole of mercury-- 6.02
times 10 to the 23 mercury

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.130
atoms-- has that many
grams of mass.

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.010
So instead of 200 atomic mass
units per atom, we have 200

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.980
grams per mole of that atom.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:57.870
It's an easy calculation.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.910
You just look up it atomic mass
number and say it's that

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.640
many grams. You have a mole
of the substance.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.490
Fair enough.

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:11.130
And what about one
mole of chlorine?

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.100
We do the same exercise.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.170
We go down to our
periodic table.

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:20.190
Chlorine has a mass number
of, let's say, 35.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.360
It has various isotopes
on this planet.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.710
But let's say the mass
number is 35.

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.040
So one chlorine atom weighs--
well now, we shouldn't say

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.140
weighs, we have to
be very careful.

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.700
One chlorine atom has a mass
of 35 atomic mass units.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:40.740
So 6.02 times 10 to the 23
chlorine atoms, or one mole of

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:46.480
chlorine atoms will
have a mass of 35.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.840
35 grams.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:54.950
So how many moles of
mercury do I have?

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.950
Let me get my calculator
going.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.740
So I have 75 grams of mercury.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.320
One mole of mercury would have
a mass of 200 grams. So I

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.210
could just take 75 divided by
200 and it tells me how many

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:18.360
moles I have. 75 divided
by 200 is equal to

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:27.910
0.375 moles of mercury.

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:28.640
How did I figure that?

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.690
One mole of mercury would be
200 grams. I only have 75

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.710
grams of mercury, so I have a
small fraction of it, roughly

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.980
0.375 moles of mercury.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.140
I've just expressed the number
of atoms of mercury I have.

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:47.200
Moles tells me it's 6.02 times
10 to the 23 atoms of mercury.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.430
So I have 0.375 times Avogadro's
number of mercury

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:53.530
atoms. Fair enough.

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:55.750
Now let's do the chlorine.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.790
I have 25 grams of chlorine.

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:01.310
One mole of chlorine
is 35 grams. So I

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.980
have 25 over 35 moles.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.850
So what's that?

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:29.830
So 25 divided by 35 is equal
to 0.714 moles of chlorine.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:31.625
Now these numbers, they're
not exact.

00:07:31.625 --> 00:07:35.260
Because if you take twice this
number up here, you don't get

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.270
twice this number right here.

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:39.940
If you get twice this,
you don't get this.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:46.340
But this is roughly twice as
many moles of chlorine as I do

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.140
of mercury.

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:50.550
So that tells me that for every
mercury atom-- remember,

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:53.970
moles is just a number-- for
every mercury atom I have, I

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:59.320
have two chlorine atoms. So the
empirical formula here is

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:04.680
for every mercury I have
two chlorines.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:08.250
I have two chlorines,
right there.

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:11.040
And the numbers didn't work
out almost exactly right.

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:15.930
Especially in the real world,
when you're actually trying to

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:18.310
figure out things empirically,
your numbers seldom will.

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:21.030
And maybe there's some random
other things running out there

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:23.510
in terms of other things that
are contributing to the mass.

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:27.280
But this is close enough to know
that the ratio of mercury

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:31.110
to chlorine is roughly 1:2.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:32.539
Right?

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:33.230
This is a number.

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:35.990
For every one chlorine atom,
you have roughly two.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:37.179
You have twice as many.

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:38.600
I guess the other way of
thinking about it is you have

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.440
twice as many chlorine
atoms in the

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.460
bag as you have mercury.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:42.909
Roughly.

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:44.030
Although this is a
little bit more.

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:45.830
This is close to 0.75.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:47.770
But it's close enough for you
to know that you're dealing

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:50.160
with mercury chloride.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:50.980
Right there.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:52.670
Let's do another one of these.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:54.960
Let's see how the numbers
turn out for this one.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:09:02.500
Let's say you have another
bag that is 9% magnesium.

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:15.740
And let's say the remainder of
the bag, 91%, is iodine.

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:16.990
91% is iodine.

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:19.090
So the way to do all of these
is, you do the same thing.

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:23.290
Assume you have 100 grams. So
if you have 100 grams, of

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:27.860
which you have 9 grams
of magnesium.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:31.470
And you have 91 grams
of iodine.

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:34.840
And then figure out how much a
mole of magnesium-- what would

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.020
be the mass of a mole
of magnesium and

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:37.710
then a mole of iodine.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:39.100
So let me write here.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:42.760
One mole of magnesium.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.670
And we want to figure out
one mole of iodine.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:50.760
Let's figure those out.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:56.200
So magnesium's mass number is,
let's just go with 24.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.520
Let's say we have the
isotope that's 24.

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.990
Magnesium is 24 and since
we're already down here,

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:02.280
what's iodine.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.590
127.

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:07.270
It's 127.

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:11.510
Iodine is one of the halogens.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:11.810
So let's see.

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:14.160
You have 127 and you have 24.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.360
Let me write those down.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:28.180
So you have 127 and
you have 24.

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:36.710
So one atom of iodine has a mass
of 127 atomic mass units.

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:41.000
So a whole mole all of it, 6.02
times 10 to the 23 iodine

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.850
atoms will have a mass of 127
grams. You just take the

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:51.890
atomic weight, or the atomic
mass, and the mass will be

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:54.600
that many grams when you have
this many of the atom.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:58.380
So then one mole of magnesium
will be 24 grams.

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:00.620
So now we just figure out how
many moles of each of these we

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:04.860
have. We have 9 grams
of magnesium.

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.650
So what fraction of
a mole is that?

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:09.870
A mole is 24 grams. So
this is equal to

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:15.842
9/24 moles of magnesium.

00:11:15.842 --> 00:11:19.540
And what is 9 over 24?

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:25.410
9 divided by 24 is
equal to 0.375.

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:30.870
So this is equal to 0.375, which
is similar to what we

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:33.610
had in the last problem when
that 0.375 showed up.

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:36.670
And 91 grams of iodine
is what?

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:39.320
91 grams of iodine.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.400
Well, in a whole mole of iodine
you're going to have

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:49.800
127 grams. So we have 91/127
moles of iodine.

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.730
And what's 91 over 127?

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:53.920
I have a feeling we're going to
have very similar numbers.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:12:00.280
121 divided by 127 is
equal to 0.716.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.100
I should do another problem with
better ratios than this.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:08.700
These have the same ratios as
the last problem, 0.72,

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:12.460
roughly, moles of iodine.

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.890
And this is moles
of magnesium.

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:19.920
So we have roughly twice the
number of iodine atoms as we

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:23.030
do of magnesium atoms. Right?

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:26.700
For every one magnesium atom
we have roughly two iodine

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:28.360
atoms. I know this isn't
exactly 1:2,

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.110
but it's pretty close.

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:37.000
So the formula here is
magnesium iodide.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:37.540
Right there.

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:38.660
And that's the empirical
formula.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:42.060
We don't know, maybe in every
atom maybe you had two

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:43.790
magnesiums and four iodines.

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:44.910
We don't know.

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:47.220
All we know is that the
ratio of magnesium to

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.360
iodine here is 1:2.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.940
In the next video, I'm going to
try to look for ones that

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:53.070
have more interesting ratios,
because I don't want to do two

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:54.740
problems that both have
the same ratio.

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.150
But hopefully you found this
a little bit helpful.
