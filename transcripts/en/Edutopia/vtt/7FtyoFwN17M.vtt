00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:15.756
&gt;&gt;In the 2006, 2007 school
year, we were listed as one

00:00:15.756 --> 00:00:18.976
of the 30 worst performing schools
in the state of North Carolina.

00:00:23.046 --> 00:00:27.176
&gt;&gt;The things that I saw when I got
here were children just running up

00:00:27.176 --> 00:00:29.846
and down the halls,
hollering, screaming,

00:00:29.846 --> 00:00:31.666
just a level of almost mayhem.

00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:34.986
&gt;&gt;Joshua: A fair amount of them
come without any resources at all.

00:00:34.986 --> 00:00:38.356
Some days our children go home and
they may not have a home to go to.

00:00:38.356 --> 00:00:40.446
Some days our children go home
and there may not be food.

00:00:40.446 --> 00:00:44.616
&gt;&gt;There was a lotta teacher turnover
back then and I think we were

00:00:44.616 --> 00:00:47.066
in a mentality where it was
just about teachers surviving.

00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:49.416
&gt;&gt;There used to be bullies.

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:55.496
Like the bullies, like make you
scared, like you didn't even want

00:00:55.496 --> 00:00:58.616
to look at them, because they
were like, "You have a problem?"

00:00:58.616 --> 00:01:00.196
&gt;&gt;Shana: Back at that
time, it kinda felt

00:01:00.196 --> 00:01:03.046
like the students were
running the school in a sense.

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:05.436
&gt;&gt;Angela: I quit my first year here,

00:01:05.436 --> 00:01:07.246
because it was just
so difficult for me.

00:01:13.336 --> 00:01:16.446
&gt;&gt;Shana: We had a principal that
came in, maybe in September,

00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:17.846
October of the school year.

00:01:18.516 --> 00:01:21.686
She spent the first coupla months
just identifying everything

00:01:21.686 --> 00:01:23.256
that we needed to change
about the school.

00:01:24.256 --> 00:01:27.596
Number one thing is, we
had to look at our staff.

00:01:27.596 --> 00:01:30.636
If you weren't here for the kids,
this wasn't the place for you.

00:01:31.206 --> 00:01:33.886
&gt;&gt;Angela: The new principal who
came in at the time, she called me

00:01:33.886 --> 00:01:35.546
and she said, 'Miss
Johnson, we really need you.

00:01:35.546 --> 00:01:37.696
We know that you're
a phenomenal teacher.

00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:39.736
Could you please just come back?'

00:01:39.736 --> 00:01:43.616
And my only request from
her was if I come back,

00:01:44.126 --> 00:01:45.466
something has to be different.

00:01:47.426 --> 00:01:50.916
&gt;&gt;Shana: Then once we got all of the
right people, that's when we began

00:01:51.026 --> 00:01:53.316
to look at what we were
doing in the classroom

00:01:53.316 --> 00:01:55.796
and why our kids weren't getting it.

00:01:55.796 --> 00:01:58.486
And we found the root
of that to be the way

00:01:58.486 --> 00:01:59.766
that we were teaching our students.

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:02.516
&gt;&gt;Once we go over each
of these big pieces

00:02:02.516 --> 00:02:06.056
of the lesson planning
process, you need to go back

00:02:06.136 --> 00:02:07.566
to your plans and adjust.

00:02:08.646 --> 00:02:12.176
Implement whatever we've learned
in the session, correct it,

00:02:12.176 --> 00:02:13.926
revise it, do whatever that may be.

00:02:14.176 --> 00:02:17.926
&gt;&gt;Four teachers from our school went
to a training in Atlanta to look

00:02:17.926 --> 00:02:19.476
at this new instructional model,

00:02:19.476 --> 00:02:22.416
and that's when we brought
in the non negotiables.

00:02:22.776 --> 00:02:25.286
&gt;&gt;-- essential question and
then we have our key vocabulary.

00:02:25.616 --> 00:02:26.846
Then we went to essential

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:29.956
and hot water thinking
questions, which we spent time on.

00:02:40.046 --> 00:02:43.586
&gt;&gt;Joshua: I think the biggest
thing that we've had to focus

00:02:43.586 --> 00:02:48.486
on here is creating a professional
development plan that's consistent.

00:02:48.726 --> 00:02:50.796
What does research
show that really works?

00:02:51.026 --> 00:02:55.766
And then being consistent in the
implementation across multiple years.

00:02:55.766 --> 00:02:58.226
&gt;&gt;Shana: 'How do you
craft questions?'

00:02:58.226 --> 00:02:59.436
will be one question, and then what?

00:02:59.436 --> 00:03:01.506
[All:] How do we challenge
our students?

00:03:01.676 --> 00:03:04.306
How do we challenge our students?

00:03:04.446 --> 00:03:07.746
&gt;&gt;Angela: Now we have collaborative
learning where students are on board,

00:03:08.426 --> 00:03:10.686
and they are participating.

00:03:10.686 --> 00:03:11.716
And they know what to expect.

00:03:11.926 --> 00:03:14.366
So there's a huge difference
between what it was

00:03:14.366 --> 00:03:15.816
like four years ago and now.

00:03:15.866 --> 00:03:18.636
&gt;&gt;And how like they dress
or do something in public.

00:03:19.346 --> 00:03:21.016
So they're sagging, or
something like that?

00:03:21.166 --> 00:03:24.366
And like the stereotypical ways, like
they come from a bad home or they're

00:03:24.366 --> 00:03:26.526
like around bad people
or something like that.

00:03:26.526 --> 00:03:28.386
&gt;&gt;Angela: Okay, so you
answered two questions in one.

00:03:28.436 --> 00:03:31.186
You talked about the character
motivations and then you went

00:03:31.476 --> 00:03:41.976
into one of the hot Qs, which was
generalizations and stereotypes.

00:03:42.166 --> 00:03:45.246
&gt;&gt;Shana: If I were to give some
advice to any teachers, staff,

00:03:45.346 --> 00:03:48.286
schools that are in our
situation or similar,

00:03:48.366 --> 00:03:52.536
the one thing that I would tell
them is, you have to be intentional

00:03:52.536 --> 00:03:56.786
about building relationships with
your students, so that they will want

00:03:56.976 --> 00:03:59.856
to work and want to be successful.

00:03:59.856 --> 00:04:00.906
It feels good when you can walk

00:04:01.186 --> 00:04:05.136
around every classroom
and kids are engaged.

00:04:05.666 --> 00:04:08.066
It's a great thing when
students talk about teachers

00:04:08.106 --> 00:04:09.486
that they have good
relationships with.

00:04:09.596 --> 00:04:12.766
&gt;&gt;Labria: I think the teachers here,

00:04:12.766 --> 00:04:16.326
they are so hands on,
and they'll come to you.

00:04:16.326 --> 00:04:18.076
And I think Miss Johnson cares a lot.

00:04:19.366 --> 00:04:20.876
What is that?

00:04:20.876 --> 00:04:21.936
That looks like a cloud.

00:04:22.166 --> 00:04:26.936
Yeah, Do the little ruffle thingies.

00:04:26.966 --> 00:04:29.956
Maybe you can put layers
of those- Okay, good.

00:04:30.046 --> 00:04:32.026
&gt;&gt;Joshua: It's all about
relationships for us.

00:04:32.126 --> 00:04:35.816
Having those relationships
with our staff, with each other

00:04:36.036 --> 00:04:38.096
and with our students,
that's what works.

00:04:38.186 --> 00:04:41.116
That's what makes a
difference here at Cochrane.

00:04:41.116 --> 00:04:45.406
&gt;&gt;Angela: The reason why I do
what I do is for my students.

00:04:45.406 --> 00:04:49.006
If I didn't get the
results that I got,

00:04:49.086 --> 00:04:52.266
if I didn't see their
faces every day,

00:04:52.266 --> 00:04:56.786
there would be no point
in me being here.

00:04:56.896 --> 00:05:01.576
The gift that I receive more so
than monetary gifts is knowing

00:05:01.576 --> 00:05:04.466
that my students are empowered.
