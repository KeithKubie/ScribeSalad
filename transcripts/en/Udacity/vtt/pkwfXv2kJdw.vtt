00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.770
So this is a concept that we're going to be

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.700
able to apply in lots of different settings when we have

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.160
infinite hypothesis classes. And this is really the fundamental way that

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.080
it's used except usually, there's kind of a more of a

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.200
technical sounding definition. This notion of labeling in all possible

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.190
ways is usually termed shattering. So this quantity that we're talking

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.220
about here, this, this size of the largest set of inputs

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.440
that the hypothesis space can shatter, is called the VC dimension.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.310
&gt;&gt; What does VC stand for?

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.500
&gt;&gt; VC stands for Vapnik - Chervonenkis which is a

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.462
pair of actual people. So that, you know, really smart

00:00:35.462 --> 00:00:38.190
insightful guys that put together this notion of a definition

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.120
and what they did is they can relate the VC

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.840
dimension of a class to the amount of data that

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.560
you need to be able to learn effectively in that

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.010
class. S, as long as this dimensionality is finite. Even

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.540
if the hypothesis class is infiniite. We are going to be

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.900
able to say things about how much data we need to learn.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.750
So, that's, that's really cool. It really connects things up beautifully. So, I

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.860
think what would be a really useful exercise now is to look at

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.160
various kinds of hypothesis classes. And for us to measure the VC dimension.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.290
&gt;&gt; Okay, sounds like fun.
