00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.780
In this lesson, you learned how to conceptualize and

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.090
create a complex data model with relationships. you learned the

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.240
difference between a look-up relationship and a master detail

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.013
relationship. You also learn the difference between a one-to-many and

00:00:14.013 --> 00:00:18.020
a many-to-many relationship. Going forward. In the next lesson,

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.580
we're going to take all of the data we have in

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.710
our custom schema and create reports to summarize it.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.840
Afterwards, we'll create colorful charts to give us real-time snapshot

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.950
views of the most interesting aspects of that data. See you next lesson.
