00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:17.883
Good afternoon.

00:00:17.883 --> 00:00:19.550
Thank you very much,
indeed, for coming.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.920
So my task this
afternoon is to take you

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.280
on a bit of a tour
of the solar system.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.320
For reasons of time, I
have had to limit myself

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.510
to planets and dwarf planets.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.880
If you have a particular
enthusiasm for moons,

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.630
I'm afraid I won't be
talking about those,

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.290
but you're welcome to
ask questions at the end.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.990
One of the joyous things
about being an astronomer,

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.930
just at the moment, is
that virtually everything

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.150
that I'm going to tell
you this afternoon

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.720
has been discovered
within our lifetimes.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.880
In the Space Age, we've
had the opportunity

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.710
to send spacecraft out to
explore the solar system.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.610
We've learnt an enormous
amount about what's out there.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.160
We've also discovered
a whole load of things

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.020
that we're not quite
so clear about,

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.040
so we've created a few
mysteries for ourselves as well.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.920
And what I'll hopefully
do, as I go through this,

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.310
is highlight some of the things
that we still don't understand

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.620
about our local neighbourhood.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.530
So I'm going to
start with Mercury

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.510
and work my way out
towards the edge

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.430
of the solar system in
the hope of giving it

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.600
some sort of structure.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.920
And this is the first mission
that was sent to Mercury.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.820
It was a NASA mission
and called Mariner 10.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.180
It's an example of how
back in the mid-1970s

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.720
we didn't understand quite
the environment that we

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.130
were dealing with.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.970
So no sophisticated onboard
computers on this spacecraft.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.780
So it had to rely,
for navigation,

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.930
on a star tracker, which was
basically a telescope that

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.770
was designed to take
an image of the heavens

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.700
around the spacecraft and
find the star Canopus, which

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.160
is bright, and lock onto it.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.039
And then use that as a
way of navigating its way

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.920
towards the planet Mercury.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.110
Now, one of the things
NASA were concerned about

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.970
was they were going
towards Mercury--

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.140
that was close to the sun.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.930
They were a little concerned
that the spacecraft would

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.580
get quite hot, so
they provided it

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.590
with a sun shield which
they thought would

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.450
keep the electronics cool.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.860
That was a good idea.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.730
They then said to
themselves, well,

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.150
we're going to send radio
signals up a wave guide

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.330
to this antenna to beam the
pictures that we take back

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.490
to the Earth.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.370
Perhaps it would be a good
idea if we painted that wave

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.660
guide white, so that it would
reflect the sun's energy

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.685
and not get too hot.

00:02:46.685 --> 00:02:48.560
That was an example of
how they didn't really

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.230
understand the effects
of the space environment

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.420
on paint, back then.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.450
We don't paint things that
we send into space anymore,

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.080
because paint really doesn't
enjoy the space environment.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.940
It tends to flake off.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.460
Now, you can see what
potentially happens here.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.410
The paint flakes
off the wave guide

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.990
and then starts drifting
along beside the spacecraft.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.170
And eventually, a paint
flake drifts into the field

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.690
of view of the star camera.

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.260
Now, it's very small, but
it's very close to the camera

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.700
and it's reflecting sunlight.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.460
So the camera, which is
designed to find the brightest

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:27.410
thing in its field, say, oh,
and starts to track the paint

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.450
flakes instead of
the star Canopus,

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.550
which was a bit of a problem.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.040
Eventually, NASA realised
what the problem was,

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.770
and then they made a random
manoeuvre to leave the cloud

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.090
of paint flakes behind.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.413
And eventually,
they got to Mercury.

00:03:40.413 --> 00:03:42.080
And what they found
when they got there,

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.420
as you can see the picture
on the right-hand side,

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.600
is a very ancient surface.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.300
There are thousands and
thousands of craters

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.090
on the surface of Mercury,
implying that it's

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.590
a very ancient surface.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.980
There has been a long
time for a lot of impacts

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.070
to happen on the
surface of Mercury.

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.290
And I'll return to
that sort of theme

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.900
again later in the presentation.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.420
The number of craters you
count are a good indication

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.570
of the age of a surface.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.910
So we discovered a few
things about Mercury

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.390
that we didn't expect.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.510
We found that it has
a magnetic field.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.940
I don't think many people
thought that Mercury would

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.240
still have some
sort of liquid core

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.870
that was actually allowing it
to generate a magnetic field.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.450
We found an enormous
impact feature,

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.550
called the Caloris Basin.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.980
And that's quite an
interesting feature,

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.720
because what we
think happened was

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.380
there was a massive impact
that created that crater,

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.620
and the shockwaves ran
around the edge of Mercury

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.230
until they met up again on
the far side, at which point

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.570
there was nowhere
for the energy to go.

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.720
And the energy, basically,
just completely disturbed

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.650
the surface of Mercury, to
the point where, essentially,

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.290
the geologists just
gave up and decided

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:58.555
to call it Weird Terrain.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.640
Now.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:06.890
I'll just throw out one
slight point to ponder.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:11.330
Does that same process
happen on the Earth?

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.680
65 million years ago there
was a very large impact

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.240
that is supposed to have
killed off the dinosaurs.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.450
That happened in the
Yucatan Peninsula.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.320
So where's the opposite
point on the Earth?

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.200
Well, it turns out, that's
somewhere in the Indian Ocean.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.300
A bit south of where India is
today, but almost exactly where

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.060
India was 65 million years ago.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.650
And if you know
your geology, you'll

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.930
know there's a thing called
the Deccan Traps, which

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.830
are huge outpourings
of lava that covered

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.280
a large part of the
Indian subcontinent,

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.440
dated to about the same
age, and at the point where

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.140
India was 65 million years ago.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.440
Maybe that process
happens here, too.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.750
Now, a more recent
mission to Mercury

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.780
is called Messenger, and
that spacecraft another NASA

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.550
mission.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.500
Rather more sophisticated
piece of kit,

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.930
with a much cleverer camera.

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.730
So we're now looking at taking
separate images in a number

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:13.380
of different
spectral bands, i.e.,

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.750
and a number of
different colour bands.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.500
And what that allows you to do
is a much more sophisticated

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.170
estimate of what the
different materials are

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:24.090
on the surface of Mercury.

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:28.230
So some of them are thought
to be impact features.

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.530
Some of them are thought to be
sort of volcanic type features

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:35.280
where material came out of
the interior of Mercury.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.450
And some of the areas--

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:38.760
the stuff marked in
blue on this picture--

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.640
are still giving the
geologists pause for thought.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.873
When we figure it out,
we'll let you know.

00:06:44.873 --> 00:06:46.290
Now, one of the
things that I find

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:50.460
fascinating about these images
from the Messenger spacecraft

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.550
is that there are evidence
of, what I'm going to call,

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:56.070
volatiles on the surface.

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:59.550
So volatiles-- things like
water, maybe carbon dioxide,

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:03.030
anything that will turn into
a gas when it warms up--

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:04.860
you would have
thought that Mercury,

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.200
being relatively
close to the sun,

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.100
would have lost any of that
sort of material a long time ago

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.800
and would be completely
depleted in volatiles.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.400
But the light-coloured
deposits on the surface

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.880
that you can see here
are very recent deposits.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.700
We can tell that
because those deposits

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.910
lie over the tops of the
various impact features.

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:30.090
So they must have
been put there later.

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:34.050
So geologically
speaking, they're recent.

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:36.510
And the best hypothesis
for what's going on there

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:40.500
is that when Mercury was formed,
it was a molten ball of iron,

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.600
to a first
approximation, and there

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:46.350
was the ability for that iron
to accommodate a certain amount

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:48.720
of hydrogen gas.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:53.040
And that over geological time,
as Mercury is very slowly

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.940
cooling down, the iron
can't hold onto as much

00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:00.840
of that hydrogen.
And so very slowly,

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:05.670
Mercury is kind of fizzing
hydrogen into the space

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:08.100
environment, and
bringing with it whatever

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.990
that light-coloured deposit is.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:11.970
At least we think
that's what's going on,

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:14.400
but that's another mystery
that we have to solve.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.420
We don't have a good idea at
the moment of exactly what

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:21.240
those deposits are made of.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.710
So moving on to Venus.

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:26.070
So if you try observing
Venus visually--

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:29.370
it's a very challenging
target, extraordinarily thick

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:30.570
atmosphere.

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:34.110
It's about 90 times the
Earth's atmospheric pressure.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:38.250
And the temperature
is enormous as well.

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:42.490
You're looking at 480 degrees
C, I think, on average.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:45.160
So it's not a very
pleasant place to go.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.720
Most of the atmosphere
is carbon dioxide.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.520
And as you can see, from
that picture on the screen,

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.310
you can't see through the
atmosphere in the visible part

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:55.360
of the spectrum.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.940
That didn't deter the Russians.

00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:00.750
So the Russians were the
first nation, and still

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:03.180
the only nation, to
ever land a spacecraft

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.130
on the surface of Venus.

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:07.530
A tricky thing to do, given
the pressure and temperature.

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:11.272
You'll notice that
the spacecraft looks

00:09:11.272 --> 00:09:12.480
a bit like a pressure vessel.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.420
It's got a degree of
spherical symmetry.

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.880
A lot of the early Russian
spacecraft were like that.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.610
If you picture Sputnik,
it was also a ball.

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:23.970
It was designed to be
pressurised inside so that

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:29.080
the electronics had a relatively
benign environment to work in.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:33.090
And that spacecraft managed
to get down to the surface,

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:34.770
and it took the only
pictures that we

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:37.470
have of the surface of Venus.

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:41.160
The version at the
top of this slide

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.327
is the picture that was put out
by the Russians at the time.

00:09:45.327 --> 00:09:47.160
They were very proud
of the fact that they'd

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:52.140
managed to beat the Americans
to land on the surface of Venus.

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:55.590
The picture at the bottom is a
more recently processed version

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:59.940
of the same image, where they've
corrected for the colour change

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:04.740
that is involved with the light
coming down through that very

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.360
thick atmosphere.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.550
It's not very pleasant
on the surface of Venus.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:13.260
But it's also not that
funny mustardy-yellow colour

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:14.220
in reality.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:17.890
And the bottom
picture shows what

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:20.740
it would look like if you
didn't have the atmospheric haze

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.520
to deal with.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.390
The US have been to Venus.

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:27.420
They haven't actually
landed on the surface.

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:30.570
But what they did do was put
a spacecraft called Magellan

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:31.860
in orbit around it.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.680
That spacecraft was deployed
by the space shuttle,

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:38.610
and had a radar
shown here, that was

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:41.040
able to send radio waves
down to the surface,

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:45.120
bounce the radio waves off the
surface and receive the echoes.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.750
And essentially, was the sort of
satellite equivalent of a bat,

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:52.660
so it was able to do radar
imaging of the surface.

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:54.720
And if you do that,
you can essentially

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:59.400
remove the clouds from Venus,
which is what this image shows.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.880
So interesting surface.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.740
There aren't very many
impact craters on Venus.

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.740
Now, part of the reason
for that is that there's

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:08.880
a very thick atmosphere.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:12.540
But the biggest impactors
potentially would still

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:14.170
go straight through.

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:16.770
So what that tells you,
the lack of craters,

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:19.290
is that Venus has a
relatively young surface.

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:22.230
And interestingly, the
surface looks pretty much

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:24.930
the same the whole planet over.

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:28.230
And we think that about 500
million years ago, there

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:31.410
was some resurfacing
event on Venus.

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:33.300
Maybe there was a
major impact that

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.730
dumped an enormous amount
of energy into Venus

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:37.920
and melted the whole
of the surface.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.330
We're not quite sure.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:42.210
But whatever it was, all
of the surface of Venus

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:45.300
is only 500 million
years old, compared

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:50.333
to a solar system lifetime of
about 4 and 1/2 billion years.

00:11:50.333 --> 00:11:51.750
One of the other
things that we've

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:54.630
discovered from imaging
Venus in this way

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:57.930
is that there is evidence
of vulcanism everywhere.

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:00.300
What's interesting
about these features

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.430
is they're somewhat
reminiscent of the sort

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:05.760
of volcanic features that
you would see on Earth, but

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.360
much, much bigger.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:12.030
So this is tens of
kilometres long.

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:14.450
It's an outflow from a volcano.

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:16.920
The reason it's so much
bigger than the outflows

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:20.040
from volcanoes on the
Earth, despite the fact

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:23.040
that Venus is a similar sized
body to the Earth, and it's

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.800
similar gravity, is that the
temperature is so much higher

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.880
that the rocks are
much less viscous,

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.820
and the lava, essentially,
flows more like water

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.850
than the sort of lava we're
familiar with on the surface

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:37.500
of the Earth.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.290
Now, we haven't
necessarily caught

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:43.710
Venus in the process of
having a volcanic eruption.

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:47.190
It's a little tricky to do with
all that atmosphere in the way.

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:50.760
The European Space
Agency has sent a mission

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.880
and put it in orbit
around Venus as well.

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:56.710
That mission had
an infrared camera,

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:59.400
which was able to look
in the heat bands,

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.320
and they found some
things that look

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.830
rather like volcanoes which
appear to be hot at the top.

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:06.390
So that's a pretty
good indication

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:08.760
that they genuinely
are volcanoes and could

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.650
erupt at some point.

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:14.940
And there are some observations
such as this bright spot that

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:16.920
was seen in Venus's atmosphere.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:18.430
So it's a transient feature.

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:21.210
It appeared for a while
in Earth-based telescopes

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:22.620
and then disappeared again.

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:25.290
And you wonder,
well, what was that?

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:28.620
Well, it's possible it was
a volcanic eruption down

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:32.190
on the surface, throwing a whole
load of different chemicals

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:35.580
into the atmosphere of Venus
at that particular location,

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:38.540
which interacted differently
with the sunlight,

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:42.360
and made Venus look a little
bit different in terms of colour

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.190
in that particular location.

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:48.600
But we still await the
first conclusive evidence

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:53.640
of a volcano actually
erupting on Venus.

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:57.840
One of the things that's
really puzzled the scientists

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:01.260
is the fact that in the gap
between the American Magellan

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:05.340
mission and the Venus
Express mission, the winds

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:10.530
and the rotation of Venus appear
to have changed significantly.

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:12.210
The winds have got a lot faster.

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:15.420
They've gone from, on average,
300 kilometres an hour

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:18.050
to 400 kilometres an hour.

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:21.900
And the rotation of Venus,
which is extremely slow,

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.270
appears to have
changed by about 6

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:28.290
and 1/2 minutes in the same
sort of period of time,

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:31.728
about 20 years, which is
really quite astonishing.

00:14:31.728 --> 00:14:33.270
I mean, if you think
about the Earth,

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:36.570
it's about the same
size planet as Venus.

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:40.890
Our rotation changes almost
imperceptibly over that sort

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:41.520
of time.

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.920
You've probably heard
of us adding a leap

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.170
second occasionally.

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:49.230
That leap second is added
to account for the fact

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:52.800
that the Earth is very
slowly spinning down.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:56.640
But it would appear that
Venus can change its rotation

00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:00.750
rate by 6 and 1/2 minutes
in the same time, which

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:03.240
implies there's some really
weird and interesting

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.520
interaction going on
with its atmosphere

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:08.760
that we don't understand
at the moment.

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:09.900
So moving on to Mars--

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:15.000
I'm going to skip over the Earth
because we're already here.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.400
So one of the first
major missions to Mars--

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.730
there were a few missions that
sort of flew past and took

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:25.710
images as they whizzed by.

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:29.610
But the first major
significant mission

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:31.290
was the one that
Carl Sagan, who was

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:34.860
mentioned in the introduction,
was much involved with.

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:36.990
So it was the Viking landers.

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:42.570
The lander's actually
inside this entry shroud,

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:45.930
so this part of the
spacecraft detached.

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:49.410
This bit stayed in orbit
to relay the pictures back

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:52.950
from this lander that's
folded up inside here.

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:55.680
And when they landed
they used this scoop

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:58.140
to dig a trench in the surface--

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:00.330
scoop up a bit of Martian soil--

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:03.570
and deploy it into, essentially,
a chemistry laboratory

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:05.340
on the lander.

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:10.260
And they attempted to spot
martian microbes in the soil.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.740
They essentially
provided nutrients

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:16.980
that they thought
might feed a bacteria.

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:20.790
They saw a reaction inside
their chemistry lab.

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:23.220
There is still a
debate, even today,

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:25.710
about whether they
actually detected

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:28.590
some sort of microbial
life in the surface.

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:29.880
It's a very long debate.

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.430
I don't have time to
reiterate it all here.

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:35.580
But there are also some
very active chemicals

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:40.590
in the surface of Mars that
might also have created

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:42.420
the reaction that they saw.

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:44.610
So it's not entirely clear.

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:49.320
Also, bacteria are a
surprisingly stubborn things.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.960
They can withstand
all sorts of exposure

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:55.190
to the space environment.

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:59.130
Although they tried to clean the
Viking spacecraft before they

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:01.920
sent them, it's possible
that there was still

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:05.430
some contamination from
some Earth bacteria

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:07.349
in the experiment somewhere.

00:17:07.349 --> 00:17:11.190
And that when they actually
deposited the nutrients

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:12.960
in the Martian
soil, all they did

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:16.500
was feed some Earth bacteria
that they had taken with them.

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:20.260
And that debate continues now.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:24.010
One of the reasons why I'm a
big fan of robotic exploration,

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:26.410
rather than manned
exploration, is

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:29.260
that there are so many
different places on Mars

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.350
that I would love
to send a robot to.

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:34.510
There are all sorts
of different terrain,

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:38.640
from polar caps, where you
can find water ice and carbon

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:39.880
dioxide ice.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:43.180
There are all sorts of dunes
and sand-based features.

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:47.350
There's all sorts of really,
really interesting stuff

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:48.250
on Mars.

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.590
And this slide
just sort of shows

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:52.930
some of the variety
of different places

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:54.320
that you can go and visit.

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:58.240
So unlike Venus, which has
a very uniform surface,

00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.920
Mars is very different.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:03.010
Some of Mars' surface
is covered in craters,

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:04.870
implying it's quite old.

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:08.890
Some of the Northern hemisphere
of Mars has almost no craters,

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:10.990
and that's part of
the clue to the fact

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:13.780
that there may once have been
an ocean around the North

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:16.250
Pole of Mars.

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:19.015
We've managed with
European spacecraft,

00:18:19.015 --> 00:18:21.700
a spacecraft called
Mars Express this time

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:27.010
rather than Venus Express,
to catch transient features

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:28.550
on the surface of Mars.

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:31.930
So these are avalanches.

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:34.930
We think they're created
by carbon dioxide frost.

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:37.570
As the seasons change
on Mars, just like there

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:40.660
are seasons on the Earth, the
temperature of the surface

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:44.350
heats up, and some of the
carbon dioxide, essentially,

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:46.990
warms up enough to
burst out of the surface

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:49.990
and create an avalanche, which
you can see in the pictures

00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:50.500
here.

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.200
These are two
different avalanches.

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:56.380
And the fact that we've been
able to image more than one

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:58.810
of these very transient
events implies

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:02.930
that they're happening
relatively frequently.

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:07.410
The most comprehensive mission
that's been sent to the surface

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:09.660
so far is a mission
that's still working.

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:13.080
It was sent by NASA,
the Curiosity Rover.

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:17.400
Really complicated landing
sequence, involving parachutes

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.380
and heat shields initially.

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:23.550
And then there's this sort
of hovering deployment device

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:26.760
which winches down
the lander, which

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:31.110
is about the size of a
mini, onto the surface.

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:34.410
But now, within
our lifetimes we've

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:37.200
gone from the pictures
of Mars that we

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.970
had at the beginning
of the Space Age,

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:41.640
which were based on
Earth-based telescopes

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:44.340
where the pixel
resolution, if you like,

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:46.560
was hundreds of
kilometres across,

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:51.330
to being able to take close-up
pictures of rocks that

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:54.030
are really, really detailed.

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:56.520
I think that's just an
amazing leap forward

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.860
in terms of our understanding.

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:02.490
Now, one of the things that
that Rover was intended

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:07.020
to try and answer was,
was there ever liquid

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:08.580
water on the surface of Mars?

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:10.830
Lots of speculation about
whether there was or whether

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:12.030
there wasn't.

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:17.200
This first image from its
camera pretty much proves it.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.550
So I hope you can see that
there's quite a lot of evidence

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:24.450
in these hills of layering.

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:27.600
So that's like sedimentary
layers on the Earth.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.330
They are almost
certainly laid down

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:31.980
in the presence and
absence of water.

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:35.310
But the fact that
there are layers at all

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:37.650
is almost a dead
giveaway to a geologist

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:39.720
that there was definitely
water here once,

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:42.650
which is an
interesting situation,

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:45.900
as I'll explain in a moment.

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:47.520
That Rover, as I
mentioned, has been

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.640
able to take some very
close-up pictures, including

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:54.570
this thing, which looks
almost like a little flower.

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:57.450
Now, it's almost
certainly inorganic.

00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:00.450
It's probably some
form of crystal growth.

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:02.970
Mars has a very,
very thin atmosphere,

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:06.820
so it's almost like growing
crystals in a vacuum.

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:10.200
We don't see the same conditions
on the Earth, obviously.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:12.660
So exactly what that
is we're not sure,

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:15.360
because we don't see the
equivalent on the surface

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.190
of our own planet.

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:20.090
But the fact that it's there
at all is really interesting,

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:21.750
I think.

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:24.980
Now, what's got NASA
extremely excited

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:28.970
is the fact that, both from
their orbiting missions

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:31.970
and also from the rovers
down on the surface,

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:33.740
there's quite a
lot of evidence now

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:37.490
that there is methane in
the atmosphere of Mars.

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:40.730
Methane is produced
on the Earth, largely

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:45.260
either by volcanic activity
or by biological activity.

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:50.000
And we think that most of
the volcanic activity on Mars

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.950
stopped a very long time ago.

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:55.930
There are areas of volcanoes
on the surface of Mars.

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:58.920
In fact, the biggest
volcano in the solar system,

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:01.410
Mons Olympus is on Mars.

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:03.800
But we think all of
that volcanic activity

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.630
stopped a long time ago.

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:08.540
So the fact that we
see methane today,

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:11.840
and we see it in a sort
of seasonal fashion,

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:15.860
rather than sort of continuously
throughout the Martian year,

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:18.050
does sort of suggest
that it's seasonal

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:21.530
and that, just like
plants on the Earth

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:24.650
grow in the spring and summer
and then lose their leaves

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:27.920
in the winter and in
the autumn, that there

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:34.100
is seasonal activity, perhaps
in biologic activity, on Mars.

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:36.260
I had the good
fortune to have dinner

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:39.140
with Jim Green, who's the
Chief Scientist at NASA

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:40.670
a couple of weeks ago.

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:44.160
He wasn't exactly saying,
we found life on Mars.

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:47.270
But when asked, sort
of smiled and said,

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:49.700
"We find increasing
amounts of evidence."

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:53.000
And I think the situation
NASA finds itself in

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.040
is there's a lot of
scientists at NASA

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:57.410
who think they've got some
very compelling evidence

00:22:57.410 --> 00:23:02.630
for essentially bacterial
sort of life forms on Mars.

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:08.810
And that an extraordinary
claim, "We found life on Mars,"

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:11.120
needs extraordinary
evidence to prove it.

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:13.040
So they're not going public yet.

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.750
I think they want to build
the case even further.

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:18.440
But there are some interesting
facts about this methane.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:23.240
For example, the methane
disappears very quickly,

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:26.330
and that's a surprise.

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:28.880
You would expect the
methane to hang around

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:32.120
for some tens of years
before being broken down

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.590
by the ultraviolet light.

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:36.080
So if you find
methane for a while,

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.240
as part of some sort
of burst of activity,

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:40.370
and then it disappears
again, that sort of

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:45.430
implies that there's something
eating the methane, maybe.

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:47.000
The final thing I
want to say on Mars

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.680
is, did it once have an ocean?

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.110
So as I mentioned,
if you artificially

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:54.080
flood a map of Mars
with water, you

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:56.540
find that the water tends
to congregate around

00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:58.190
the Northern hemisphere.

00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:02.880
Now, Mars is further
from the Sun than we are,

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:04.520
and it's a smaller
body than we are.

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:08.070
So at the formation
of the solar system,

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:10.422
it's possible that Mars
would have cooled down

00:24:10.422 --> 00:24:12.380
to the point where it
could have had an ocean--

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:16.670
liquid water on its surface--
before the Earth did.

00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:21.333
And then it's possible that
life got started in that ocean.

00:24:21.333 --> 00:24:23.000
And then there would
have been impacts--

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.140
and we see a lot of
impact craters on Mars--

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:27.950
so we know that
Martian meteorites have

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:30.740
been found on the Earth,
and we know that bacteria

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:32.480
are very stubborn things.

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.780
So is it possible the bacterial
life from the oceans of Mars

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:39.530
got transported to the
Earth in a meteorite,

00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:41.445
landed on the Earth,
and then said, hmm.

00:24:41.445 --> 00:24:42.320
It's not so bad here.

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:44.870
Maybe I'll evolve into us.

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:48.730
It's just possible
we're all martians.

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:51.670
Now, I suspect you were
expecting to see Jupiter next,

00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:56.500
but I'm going to stick the
dwarf planet, as it's recently

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:57.580
been promoted to.

00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:01.330
So Ceres started off its life
as a planet, when it was first

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:03.025
discovered in 1901.

00:25:03.025 --> 00:25:05.500
It then got relegated
to being an asteroid.

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:08.650
And now it's been promoted
again to being a dwarf planet.

00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:11.020
Now, what's interesting
about Ceres,

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:12.960
it's got a very dark
surface in general.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:16.870
It's been exposed, as you can
see lots of impact craters.

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:18.580
Pretty old surface
you would think.

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:21.520
And then you find this rather
interesting bright feature.

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.940
Bright feature's not covered
in lots of solar system dust.

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:27.640
That means that bright
feature is recent,

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:31.750
and if you zoom in you
see potential evidence

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:33.010
of eruptive geysers.

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:35.740
Stuff is coming
out of the surface.

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:38.920
And this is what you get if
you get the highest resolution

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:39.430
images.

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:42.250
This is taken by the
spacecraft called

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:45.310
Dawn that went into orbit
around Ceres a while ago,

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:49.790
and I think is still operating
in orbit around Ceres.

00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:53.050
And you can see that there is
material, very young material,

00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:53.830
on the surface.

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:55.670
There are salts present there.

00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:59.040
We think it's very briny sort
of water being squeezed out

00:25:59.040 --> 00:25:59.710
of the surface.

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:02.200
But it's a real
surprise A, to find

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:04.720
that there's anything
fluid there at all,

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:10.510
and you wonder what process,
what energy source is providing

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:12.340
the energy to squeeze
that stuff out

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:14.770
of the interior of the body.

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:16.950
Don't know.

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:20.080
There are also
mountains on Ceres.

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:23.220
So this is the
picture looking down

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:28.320
on the top of a
cryovolcano, an ice volcano.

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.210
And this is what it
looks like side on.

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:33.250
Now, I don't know whether
you're interested in that,

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:35.400
but as somebody who
builds spacecraft,

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:38.790
I'm looking at that large
pile of ice and thinking,

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:41.610
that's my fuel depot for
when I want to go somewhere

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:43.432
else in the solar system.

00:26:43.432 --> 00:26:44.640
It's not hard to find, is it.

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.723
There's a massive great
pile of it on the surface.

00:26:46.723 --> 00:26:49.480
And because Ceres is a
relatively small body,

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.780
it's much easier to
get down onto Ceres

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:53.820
and get back off again
than it would be to go

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:57.580
and, say, mine the
polar caps of Mars.

00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:02.070
So this is an exciting place
from a rocket scientist's point

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:03.600
of view.

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.940
Now you get Jupiter.

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:08.730
The quality of the images
that we're getting on Jupiter

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:10.770
now are immense.

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:13.050
The great red spot,
if you haven't heard,

00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:15.480
for scale is bigger
than the planet Earth,

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:19.170
and has been
observed continuously

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:22.320
to be operating ever
since Jupiter was first

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.570
looked at through a
telescope by Galileo.

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:28.950
So we're aware that it's
a very long-lived feature.

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:32.550
You'll notice that the banding,
the horizontal banding,

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:36.510
is the sort of stuff that
occurs at moderate latitudes.

00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:40.620
And we learnt a lot about
Jupiter from this mission.

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:42.390
But it's another
example of where

00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:46.290
space exploration doesn't always
quite go the way you hope.

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:49.360
So this is what the spacecraft
was supposed to look like.

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:52.050
This is a sort of an
umbrella-like antenna that

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:55.650
was folded up during launch
and was supposed to unfold

00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:56.640
a bit like an umbrella.

00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:00.330
But it was actually like a
regular terrestrial umbrella--

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:03.120
they never unfold properly
when you need them to.

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:07.380
So some of the ribs of this
antenna got stuck here,

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:08.940
and it never unfolded properly.

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:11.490
So they had to use a
separate antenna that

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:13.830
was just used to
send engineering

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:15.630
data about the spacecraft back.

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:19.980
They had to use that much
smaller, much less capable

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:23.220
antenna to dribble all the
data back from this spacecraft.

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:26.340
But nevertheless,
it told us a lot.

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:29.160
When it arrived at
Jupiter it dropped a probe

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:32.970
into Jupiter's
atmosphere, detected

00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:35.010
an awful lot of lightning.

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:37.020
Didn't detect much water.

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:39.150
But they took a
picture of Jupiter

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:42.850
at the point where the probe was
entering Jupiter's atmosphere.

00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:45.060
And it dropped into
this dark region

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:48.660
here, which we think is a
region where, essentially, there

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:50.070
are no water clouds.

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:54.300
And so the probe didn't detect
water just because it missed.

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:57.420
And we think that some of these
other different colour bands

00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:03.037
might well have had quite a
lot more water tied up in them.

00:29:03.037 --> 00:29:05.120
Now, the spacecraft that's
in orbit around Jupiter

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.190
at the moment is called Juno.

00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:10.760
Notice that it looks a little
different to some of the Deep

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:13.010
Space missions that you may
have seen in that it's got

00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:14.270
solar panels.

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:17.560
This is the first
spacecraft to go beyond Mars

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:19.700
that's powered by solar panels.

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:22.100
All the Deep Space
missions that we've

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:24.410
done before have
had things called

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:26.390
radio isotope
thermal generators.

00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:29.990
Basically, a radioactive
heat source that decays,

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:32.630
generates heat, and that's
turned into electricity

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:34.160
to power the spacecraft.

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:36.830
But the quality of
solar panels has

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:38.840
increased to the point
where you can now

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:40.880
go all that distance
out of Jupiter,

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.560
and go that far
away from the Sun

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:45.510
and still generate enough
power with solar panels.

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:47.360
So this mission is
deliberately designed

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:50.510
to go over the poles of Jupiter,
and give us a sense of what

00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:51.470
the poles look like.

00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:54.260
And interestingly, they're
very, very different

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:56.000
from the banded
structure that you

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.920
see at more moderate latitudes.

00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:01.730
There's all sorts of cyclones
and interesting things going on

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:03.080
at the pole.

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:06.410
That mission is still running,
and expect more details

00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:08.350
from it soon.

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:13.660
Moving on to Saturn, I find
this absolutely fascinating.

00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:16.540
You see the rings, and they're
really, really impressive,

00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:21.270
but they are only a couple of
hundred metres, top to bottom.

00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:26.700
Thousands of kilometres side to
side, 200 metres top to bottom.

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:29.160
It's now thought that
as well as gravity

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:31.500
affecting the motion
of those particles,

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:35.460
that also there is
electrostatic forces.

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:39.000
Essentially, the particles in
the rings acquire, essentially,

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.430
a static charge
from the solar wind,

00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:43.050
and then all the
particles want--

00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:45.660
because they're all
at the same charge--

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:47.850
they want to stand at
arm's length to one another

00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:51.180
because they're all
like charges repelling.

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:55.770
You get storms in the
atmosphere of Saturn

00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:59.310
from time to time in
the summer months,

00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:01.560
because Saturn has seasons, too.

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:04.140
A lot of what we've learnt about
Saturn is from this machine

00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:07.530
called Cassini,
launched after Galileo.

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:12.540
And noticed that NASA changed
their strategy for antennas.

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:16.380
no unfurlable umbrella-like
thing this time.

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:17.778
Fixed dish.

00:31:17.778 --> 00:31:19.320
Don't have to worry
about deployments

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:21.600
messing up your
mission on this one.

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:24.060
I find this picture
rather amusing.

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:27.120
This was a joint NASA
European mission,

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:30.120
but this is the American
picture of the mission.

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:32.880
The European contribution
is this lander

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:36.240
that was dropped onto the moon
Titan, and as you can see,

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:38.910
the Americans didn't
really sort of show it off

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:41.580
to the best advantage.

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:44.370
So one of the brilliant things
they did with this mission was

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:47.370
they went-- when the spacecraft
was sort of in eclipse

00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:52.480
behind Saturn, and the Sun
was immediately behind Saturn,

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:55.440
they took an image looking
back towards the Sun,

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:58.440
and necessarily, because the
Sun is somewhere behind the disc

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:01.740
here, all the
interior planets are

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:04.110
pretty much in that direction,
from the point of view

00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:04.980
of Saturn.

00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:07.520
And I don't think it really
shows up on this projector,

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:09.660
but there are some
little bright points

00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:12.120
which are the interior planets.

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:14.020
This is really weird.

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:16.800
So Saturn is quite
significantly out of round.

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.540
It's about 10% oblate.

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:20.760
So the pole to pole
distance is much less

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:22.470
than the equatorial radius.

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:27.520
But around the poles of
Saturn there is a hexagon.

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:30.040
Now, it's a rotating
oblate spheroid.

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:35.460
How do you get straight lines
on a spherical, near spherical,

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:37.110
rotating body?

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:39.570
If you know the answer to that,
please tell me because I'd

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:41.910
love to know.

00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:47.920
So the Deep Space stuff has
largely been done by Voyager 2.

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:52.380
It's the only spacecraft that
has been to Uranus and Neptune.

00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:57.670
Fly-bys in both cases, so brief
opportunities to collect data.

00:32:57.670 --> 00:33:02.850
This is a more recent
ground-based image of Uranus,

00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:08.310
showing the one bright
ring that it has around it.

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:12.360
It doesn't have a sort of
huge ring system like Saturn.

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.850
According to the
textbooks, that ring system

00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:17.580
was discovered in 1977.

00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:19.970
I've been doing some
research recently

00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:25.920
and I think William Herschel
spotted that ring in 1789.

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.470
But that's a different lecture.

00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:31.590
So one of the things
that Voyager discovered

00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:34.900
is that Uranus has a really
weird magnetic field.

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:36.930
So on the Earth,
as you're aware,

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:40.260
we think the Dynamo theory
accounts for a magnetic field,

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:43.020
and the magnetic field has
to line up with the spin

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:44.560
axis of the Earth.

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:46.140
It's not like that on Uranus.

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:50.010
There is a 60 degree angle
between the magnetic axis

00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:51.480
and the spin axis.

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:52.800
And the spin axis is weird.

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:55.800
Most of the planets
rotate with their spin

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:58.710
axis sort of largely pointing
up out of the orbit plane

00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:02.370
that they're in, whereas
Uranus's spin axis is almost

00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:04.320
in the plane of
the solar system.

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:06.480
Can't explain that
very well either.

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:09.090
It might have been hit by
something at some point,

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:14.260
but if so, what hit it, and
where is that thing now?

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:19.060
Neptune turned out to be
interesting in that Uranus was

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:20.830
almost a completely bland disc.

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:23.860
There's a lot more
weather going on Neptune.

00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:26.830
Great dark spot, which is
a fairly transient feature,

00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:28.210
but it's very large.

00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:33.850
These light bits are clouds
that whistle round Neptune very

00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:36.460
rapidly, hundreds of
kilometres an hour.

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:41.380
Lots and lots of activity
that we didn't see at Uranus.

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:43.870
But Neptune's further away
from the Sun, and it's colder,

00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:45.969
and it should be less active.

00:34:45.969 --> 00:34:47.870
Don't understand that either.

00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:49.810
And finally, just
to talk a little bit

00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:51.070
about going to Pluto.

00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:53.230
So this is the New
Horizons mission.

00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:55.810
It took nearly 10
years to reach Pluto.

00:34:55.810 --> 00:34:58.450
NASA didn't want
to do this mission.

00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:02.380
Congress mandated
it, because Pluto

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:05.440
was discovered by
an American, a place

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:07.450
called Flagstaff in Arizona.

00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:11.170
And when the International
Astronomical Union

00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:13.240
decided that Pluto was
going to be relegated

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:17.230
to the status of dwarf planet,
rather than true planet,

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:20.640
the people in Arizona
took exception to that.

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:21.640
Sorry-- it's New Mexico.

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:23.650
It's Flagstaff in New Mexico.

00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:29.140
They decided that they
were going to pass a law.

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:32.680
And if you go out there
and you visit Flagstaff,

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:40.050
be aware that it is the law
there that Pluto is a planet.

00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:41.140
No, it really is.

00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:42.710
You ask them.

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:45.670
So this is what New
Horizons found on Pluto.

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:47.890
And again, utterly fascinating.

00:35:47.890 --> 00:35:50.560
Lots of craters in
this sort of region,

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:53.350
but this bright heart
feature, as it's known,

00:35:53.350 --> 00:35:56.140
is almost completely
devoid of craters.

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:59.380
There is evidence of
cryovolcanism, i.e., ice

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:02.200
volcanoes on Pluto, too.

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:03.850
Again the question,
what the hell

00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:06.190
is providing the
energy for that?

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:09.820
And if you look very
closely at that smooth area,

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:13.030
it looks very much as if
you've got nitrogen glaciers

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:15.910
flowing across the surface.

00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:19.060
Well, where's the energy coming
from to drive them around?

00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:21.340
And if you look
really close up, you

00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:27.280
can see it looks as if there's
some sort of slow rolling

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:31.540
sort of-- it's a bit like
boiling porridge or something,

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:34.810
if you've seen the way that
porridge behaves in a pan.

00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:36.490
Similar sort of
thing, except this

00:36:36.490 --> 00:36:40.120
is much colder and it's
nitrogen that's doing it.

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:41.920
But no impact craters at all.

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:44.010
A very young feature.

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:46.840
And this is the final picture
that New Horizons took,

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:50.350
as it sped away from
Pluto looking back.

00:36:50.350 --> 00:36:53.260
And notice the
atmospheric layering here.

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:55.360
There's all sorts
of different species

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:57.850
of stuff in Pluto's atmosphere.

00:36:57.850 --> 00:37:00.430
We're still trying to work out
what the different layers are.

00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:05.200
But it's a sort of fitting
farewell to the solar system,

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:05.982
if you like.

00:37:05.982 --> 00:37:08.440
And at that point, I'd better
stop and take some questions.

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:09.280
Thank you very much.

00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:15.750
Thank you.

00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:18.050
This is a very basic
question from somebody

00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:20.240
that knows nothing
about science.

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:21.710
That will make it
more embarrassing

00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:23.660
when I can't answer it.

00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:26.780
How do you know
that the striations

00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:28.670
would be made by water?

00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:30.110
And how do you
know that, you say

00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:33.380
there's water there or
nitrogen or what rocks they are

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:35.190
and what chemicals,
how do you know that?

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:35.690
Yes.

00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:36.890
So it's a good question.

00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:39.560
And I have to admit that you're
repeating a question that I

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:43.970
asked one of my university
lecturers many moons ago.

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:46.670
So I said, how do
you know for sure

00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:48.680
it was water, rather
than, say, liquid carbon

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:50.270
dioxide or something?

00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:52.520
So the answer to
that question is

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:54.230
to do with the
pressures that were

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:58.970
likely to be around in
the commonness of oceans

00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:02.540
made of water, compared to
oceans made of anything else.

00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:04.760
At least that's
the general theory.

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:07.340
Although you look
at Titan, the moon

00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:11.000
that I briefly mentioned
going around Saturn,

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.210
that's got liquid
on its surface,

00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:17.600
but the liquid is
liquid methane.

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:21.470
So just as the Earth is at
the triple point of water--

00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:26.150
so you can have ice, and
steam, and water on the surface

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.930
of the Earth--

00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:29.270
you can have the
same three phases--

00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:31.520
gas, solid and liquid--

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:33.620
of methane on Titan.

00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:38.150
So the probability is high,
based on the chemicals that

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:41.960
have been found in the rocks
that have been analysed

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:42.935
by the rovers.

00:38:42.935 --> 00:38:45.235
So the rovers have looked
at some of the chemicals,

00:38:45.235 --> 00:38:46.610
and I'm not enough
of a geologist

00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:48.050
to be able to name them for you.

00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:50.840
But there are some chemicals
that they've essentially

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:53.810
dug up and looked at
on Mars that are only

00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:55.880
formed in the presence
of water, as opposed

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:58.290
to carbon dioxide
or anything else.

00:38:58.290 --> 00:39:01.540
So there's good evidence that
there was definitely water.

00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:03.110
There might have
been other things.

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:04.880
I mean, there's
certainly carbon dioxide

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:08.060
in the atmosphere of Mars and
bound up in its polar caps.

00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:10.910
So maybe at some point
there might have also

00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:16.340
been carbon dioxide
liquid on the surface.

00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:18.860
If Venus is slowing
down so quickly,

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:22.740
what's happening to
the angular momentum?

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:25.970
Well, that's what we think is
speeding up the atmosphere.

00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:28.670
So there's an exchange of
energy between the rotation

00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:31.130
of the planet and the
speed of the winds,

00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:33.710
and exactly how that
works we're not clear,

00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:37.010
because it's not a process
that we see on the Earth.

00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:39.840
The Earth's atmosphere
is nowhere near as dense.

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:44.210
It's sort of like two orders
magnitude more dense on Venus.

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:48.290
So presumably, there's some
way of exchanging energy

00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:50.660
between the two, but
you can't account

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:53.090
for the speeding up of the
winds unless you get energy

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:53.840
from somewhere.

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:57.620
And at the moment, it's
assumed that energy's

00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:00.470
being stolen from the
rotation of the planet.

00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:03.650
But a full explanation
is still awaited.

00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:05.520
So what happens when it stops?

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:07.520
Yeah, well that's one of
the interesting things.

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:09.860
You can get captured rotation.

00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:12.470
And it's possible--
you know, Mercury

00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:14.570
is almost in captured rotation.

00:40:14.570 --> 00:40:19.220
A weird thing about Mercury
is that a year on Mercury

00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:22.490
is only half the length
of a day on Mercury.

00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:26.210
So it takes Mercury 88
days to go around the Sun.

00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:31.070
And a day from sunrise to
sunrise on Mercury is 176 days.

00:40:31.070 --> 00:40:32.720
It's almost captured.

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:36.760
And it could be that Venus
will end up the same way.

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:40.240
Can you say how big
Ceres is, and therefore,

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:42.900
how big that ice mountain is,
compared to anything else?

00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:46.420
Just over 900
kilometres in diameter.

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:53.260
So about 1/6 of the size
of Mars, or perhaps 1/12

00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:57.010
the diameter of the Earth.

00:40:57.010 --> 00:41:02.520
If the Earth is like
that, Ceres is like that.

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:04.350
And the mountain?

00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:05.280
Oh, sorry.

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:07.340
The mountain.

00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:09.983
I think that was on the slide.

00:41:09.983 --> 00:41:12.150
I think it's about four
kilometres high or something

00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:12.560
like that.

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:14.160
I mean, it's a
surprisingly large lump

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:15.525
of ice to be sat on the surface.

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:23.400
Could you tell me what
shape the orbit of Ceres is,

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:27.206
and what defines a dwarf planet?

00:41:27.206 --> 00:41:27.860
Ah.

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:28.360
Right.

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:34.990
So the shape of the orbit is
pretty much a circle, I think.

00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:37.030
Some of the asteroids
are more elliptical,

00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:41.290
but I think Ceres has a
fairly circular orbit, sort

00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:44.380
of midway sort of
between Mars and Jupiter.

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:46.900
If you're interested you
could look up a thing

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:50.140
called Bode's law, which
tries to use a rather

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:52.510
sort of knotty
mathematical formula

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:54.400
to predict the positions
of the planets.

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:57.340
And they used to think that
they had a gap in that law,

00:41:57.340 --> 00:41:58.480
between Mars and Jupiter.

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:02.170
And then they found Ceres and
it seemed to fit the bill.

00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:07.080
Definition of dwarf planet
is enormously controversial.

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:09.282
As indeed, the
definition of a planet.

00:42:09.282 --> 00:42:10.990
This is what got the
people in the States

00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:13.660
so steamed up when the
International Astronomical

00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:17.320
Union decided to redefine Pluto.

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:19.840
So according to
the IAU, a planet

00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:24.730
is one that has an
orbit around the Sun,

00:42:24.730 --> 00:42:27.960
and that it's large enough
that gravity has pulled it

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:30.490
into a sphere.

00:42:30.490 --> 00:42:31.910
That's what they actually wrote.

00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:35.200
They eventually backtracked and
said hydrostatic equilibrium,

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:38.440
because they realised that
Saturn wasn't a sphere,

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:41.020
and they just ruled
out Saturn as a planet.

00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:42.142
That was embarrassing.

00:42:42.142 --> 00:42:43.600
And then they said
something that's

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:46.780
got them into an enormous amount
of trouble, which they said,

00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:51.040
"And it has to have cleared
its orbit of other bodies."

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:56.800
So major planets that sort of
have no other major planets

00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:59.020
crossing their orbits are good.

00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:03.010
But if you have, in the case of
Ceres, lots of other asteroids

00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:03.850
sort of crossing.

00:43:03.850 --> 00:43:07.870
It's not necessarily the
dominant gravitational force

00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:12.820
in its orbit, and that was used
as some really dodgy, but very

00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:14.620
unscientific.

00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:16.690
Because not
unreasonably you might

00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:19.720
be sitting there thinking, what
does "cleared its orbit" mean,

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:20.890
and by how much?

00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:23.860
And if you've got a moon
going around your planet,

00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:26.320
sometimes that moon's
going to cross your orbit.

00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:28.510
Have you cleared your orbit?

00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:32.980
Embarrassingly, Jupiter
has two large groups

00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:36.250
of asteroids that are 60
degrees ahead of Jupiter

00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:40.190
and 60 degrees behind it,
called the Trojan asteroids.

00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:42.010
They're there for
gravitational reasons.

00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:44.200
They will be for the
lifetime of the solar system,

00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:45.370
as far as we know.

00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:47.470
So Jupiter hasn't
cleared its orbit

00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:50.710
because it's got loads and loads
of asteroids sharing its orbit

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:52.120
for gravitational reasons.

00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:55.590
But the IAU seemed to
have overlooked that fact.

00:43:55.590 --> 00:43:58.740
So Jupiter's not a planet
either by that definition.

00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:00.730
It's a really
rubbish definition,

00:44:00.730 --> 00:44:03.995
and I can't offer you a
better one, I'm afraid.

00:44:03.995 --> 00:44:04.870
Well, thanks so much.

00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:07.600
I'm really sorry, but we are
overrunning very slightly.

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:08.770
Stuart, are you going
to be hanging around

00:44:08.770 --> 00:44:09.590
for the tea break?

00:44:09.590 --> 00:44:10.347
Yeah, absolutely.

00:44:10.347 --> 00:44:12.430
So if you want questions
later, I'm happy to help.

00:44:12.430 --> 00:44:16.323
Please do see the man in
the astronomical waistcoat.

00:44:16.323 --> 00:44:17.740
But for the time
being, can we say

00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:20.280
thank you very much
to Stuart Eves.
