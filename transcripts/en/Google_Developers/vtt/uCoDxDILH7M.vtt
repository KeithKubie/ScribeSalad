MICHAEL PICCUIRRO: Hi, my name
is Michael Piccuirro.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.500
I'm a director of product
and innovation.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.760
I work at R/GA, which is a
large interactive agency.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.780
R/GA builds large interactive
experiences for their clients.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.020
We chose Google Cloud Platform
because it is a great tool

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.640
that allows us to build
solutions very quickly and

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.310
deploy them somewhere that can
scale to whatever we need.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.370
Sometimes we're working with
client IT departments, but

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.860
that can cause some problems.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.980
Especially, since we're not
technically employees,

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.460
sometimes we don't have the
ability to go into their

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.960
networks and deploy stuff.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.030
The Cloud Platform tools are
very helpful in allowing us to

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.540
build things very quickly.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.820
A lot of times, people are
very accustomed to having

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.800
their own private servers and
private infrastructures, and

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.530
there's a lot of fear about
producing something that's

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.950
running in an environment
that's

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.550
essentially out of your control.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.880
So I would just say, try
to get over that fear.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.760
Just run through the examples.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.390
Do some test applications.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.250
Get it out there.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.390
Get very comfortable with the
platform, and you'll find that

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.260
it's a lot easier and a lot more
scalable than any kind of

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.360
private infrastructure.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.680
My absolute favorite feature is
the ability to version and

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.550
rollback deployments
that you do.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.260
Because it allows you
to push stuff out.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.500
If it's not right or if there's
a problem, you can,

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.030
click of a button, rollback to
the way it was, and go back to

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.670
working on your problem, and
pick it up on Monday morning.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.950
Where I see our company going is
that we'll be able to build

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.980
bigger, better experiences for
our clients in a lot shorter

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.490
amount of time than we
previously were able to.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.290
Things that we would have
normally taken years to build,

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.070
we'll be able to produce in
weeks or months, and tools

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.520
like Cloud Platform will
be very helpful in

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.770
making that a reality.
