00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.526
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We know y equals 3, so which equation do you think it's easier to plug into,

00:00:04.526 --> 00:00:09.281
the first or the second? I would argue it's easier to plug into the second one.

00:00:09.281 --> 00:00:13.967
X is already solved for, so if I plug in 3 for y I can easily find the value of

00:00:13.967 --> 00:00:18.420
x. So I get x is negative 4. If you used this equation, that would have worked,

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.973
too. You still should have gotten x equal to negative 4.
