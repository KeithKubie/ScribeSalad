00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.400
What is up everyone?!

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.740
My name is Ashleigh.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.300
And today's little video is based on an article

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.360
entitled: "Nail Biting a Problem Deeper than Skin Deep."

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.640
Now I'm sure a lot of us are guilty of biting our nails.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.240
I know I am.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.200
As a kid, I used to bite my fingernails a lot.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.680
But nobody really pointed it out,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.360
except for my aunt, and after she did,

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.920
I guess you could say that was when I started using a lot of nail polish.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.240
And because I did use nail polish, it prevented me from biting my fingernails.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.840
Because I do not want all of this hard work to go to waste.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:42.960
Now according to the article,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.640
there are many reasons why a person would want to bite their nails.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.560
It can be attention seeking, sociopathy, lack of self monitoring, or self esteem

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.480
and it can even be OCD.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.320
But the most common reasons are stress and anxiety.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.520
It's used as an outlet for built up emotions

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.360
and a way to reduce tension.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:10.320
In the article, Dr. Bronow says that our skin and nails are a mirror of our emotions.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.880
It just got pretty deep, didn't it?

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.920
Now to conclude this video,

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.960
I would like to give you guys some tips on how you can stop yourselves from biting your nails.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.280
Now the first thing you're going to have to do

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.480
is confront your problem, okay?

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.680
Admit it. 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.760
Admit that you have a problem with biting your nails.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.280
Suggestion #1:

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.000
This is going to sound really ridiculous,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.760
but as long as you're at home, I think you can get away with it.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.880
You can wrap bandages around your fingernails.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.320
Suggestion #2:

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.040
this is something you can get away with,

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.680
especially when you're outside with friends or at an occasion.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.200
You can wear some stylish gloves.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.520
For all of you lovely ladies out there,

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.480
like I mentioned in the first part of my video,

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.400
you can wear some nail polish.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.800
And my last suggestion and 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.000
I think this is the best way you can stop biting your nails

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.560
is to keep your fingernails short.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.760
Now if they're short, 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.420
there's going to be absolutely nothing for you to bite.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.200
And that is my time.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.360
