00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.740
And I apologize, but this was a tricky question that

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.770
we cannot really answer. We really have no way to

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.860
know what the error was. It could have been a

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.240
typo, an erroneous copy and paste operation, or even worse

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.079
a conceptual error. In case a developer did not know

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.910
what it means to double a number. Unfortunately though, the

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.200
developer is the only one who could actually answer this

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.610
question. So even though we cannot really answer this question,

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.000
having it help us think about how the

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
error is in fact related to human behavior.
