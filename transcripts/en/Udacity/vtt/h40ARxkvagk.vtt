This is an example of the GMail inbox
displayed using a feature called

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.560
High Contrast Mode.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.260
High Contrast Mode allows
the user to invert foreground and

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.610
background colors which may help
the tech stand out a lot better.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.210
For someone with a little vision
impairment High Contrast Mode can make

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.490
it much easier to navigate
the content of the page.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.210
And there's a few ways to get high
contrast set up on your machine.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.230
Operating systems like Mac, OS X and
Windows offer High Contrast Modes that

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.170
can be enabled for
everything at the system level.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.950
Here's an example of the high
contrast controls from the Mac

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.230
accessibility system preferences.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.480
I can go on and I can turn on
invert colors, increase contrast.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.429
And there's also a slider so
I can fine tune the amount of contrast,

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:42.689
I would like to have.

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:47.493
Similarly users can install an extension
like the Chrome High Contrast

00:00:47.493 --> 00:00:51.667
extension to only enable high
contrast in that specific app.

00:00:51.667 --> 00:00:55.935
Now a useful exercise is to turn
on high contrast settings and

00:00:55.935 --> 00:00:59.038
verify that all of your
UI is still visible.

00:00:59.038 --> 00:01:03.168
For example, this navigation bar
uses a very subtle background

00:01:03.168 --> 00:01:07.500
color to indicate which
item is currently selected.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.880
If I view it using Chrome's
high contrast extension,

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.810
that background color pretty
much completely disappears and

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.740
with it goes my understanding of
which page is currently active.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.340
Similarly, if we check out our form
example from the previous lesson,

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.440
that red underline on
the invalid phone number field

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.610
is now showing up as sort of
a bright bluish green color.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.070
Thankfully, we added
a message down there to

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.670
tell us what's wrong with the field.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.890
Now if you're meeting the contrast
ratios we covered in the previous

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.980
lessons, you should be okay when it
comes to supporting high contrast users.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.170
But for added peace of mind,

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.880
consider installing the Chrome High
Contrast extension and giving your page

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.260
a once over just to double check
that everything works as expected.
