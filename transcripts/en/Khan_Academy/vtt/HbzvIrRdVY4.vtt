00:00:00.384 --> 00:00:01.645
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.645 --> 00:00:06.111
is dig a little bit deeper
into the notion of democracy.

00:00:06.111 --> 00:00:08.145
And the reason why this
is going to be valuable

00:00:08.145 --> 00:00:10.682
is it's going to inform the decisions

00:00:10.682 --> 00:00:12.846
that the Founding Fathers had to make

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:15.944
when they thought about whether
to ratify the Constitution.

00:00:15.944 --> 00:00:18.325
It'll also inform our thoughts

00:00:18.325 --> 00:00:21.664
on government as it is
today in the United States.

00:00:21.664 --> 00:00:24.090
What flavor of democracy does it take on,

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.075
especially at different
layers of government?

00:00:27.075 --> 00:00:28.715
So just as a review, and this is something

00:00:28.715 --> 00:00:30.648
that we have talked about in other videos,

00:00:30.648 --> 00:00:34.464
democracy comes from Greek
from rule by the people.

00:00:34.464 --> 00:00:38.710
Demo from demos, which
is referring to people,

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.877
and cracy coming from kratia,
which is referring to rule.

00:00:43.841 --> 00:00:45.937
So, rule by the people.

00:00:45.937 --> 00:00:49.578
Now broadly speaking, we can
think of three general flavors

00:00:49.578 --> 00:00:53.745
of democracy, the first we can
consider to be participatory.

00:00:55.277 --> 00:00:57.277
Participatory democracy.

00:00:59.437 --> 00:01:03.020
The second we can call
pluralist democracy,

00:01:05.203 --> 00:01:07.270
and I'll define these in a second.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.278
And then the third, let's
call that elite democracy.

00:01:11.278 --> 00:01:13.378
Elite democracy.

00:01:13.378 --> 00:01:17.070
Now, what do you think
participatory democracy means,

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.194
based on the word participatory?

00:01:19.194 --> 00:01:22.027
Yes, as you might have guessed it implies

00:01:22.027 --> 00:01:25.194
broad participation of the population.

00:01:26.195 --> 00:01:27.997
Broad participation.

00:01:27.997 --> 00:01:30.843
What are examples of a
participatory democracy?

00:01:30.843 --> 00:01:35.283
Well, imagine a small town
that has maybe a few hundred

00:01:35.283 --> 00:01:38.522
or a few thousand people
and if there's an issue

00:01:38.522 --> 00:01:41.516
of whether to build a stop
light at an intersection

00:01:41.516 --> 00:01:43.817
or a change in some of the zoning laws,

00:01:43.817 --> 00:01:46.582
you can imagine a large
chunk of the down showing up

00:01:46.582 --> 00:01:49.475
to weigh in on that decision.

00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:51.294
Now, what are some of the benefits

00:01:51.294 --> 00:01:53.124
of a participatory democracy

00:01:53.124 --> 00:01:55.287
and what are some of the negatives?

00:01:55.287 --> 00:01:58.578
Well, the benefits are, and
I'll do those as pluses,

00:01:58.578 --> 00:02:01.936
a benefit is, well, it
kind of seems closest

00:02:01.936 --> 00:02:04.936
to the original spirit of a democracy.

00:02:04.936 --> 00:02:08.037
It's coming out of ancient
Greece, ancient Athens,

00:02:08.037 --> 00:02:11.104
the birthplace of democracy
where you did have residents

00:02:11.104 --> 00:02:13.696
go together and debate the major issues.

00:02:13.696 --> 00:02:15.054
Although even in ancient Athens

00:02:15.054 --> 00:02:17.321
you have to take participation
with a grain of salt

00:02:17.321 --> 00:02:19.279
because it wasn't everyone
who was participating.

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:21.744
It was, for the most part, wealthy men

00:02:21.744 --> 00:02:25.744
who had the time to actually
sit and debate these issues.

00:02:25.744 --> 00:02:29.283
But, if we want to give a
participatory democracy its credit

00:02:29.283 --> 00:02:31.590
say in a small town, is that
you really are representing

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.489
the views of the people.

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.906
Representing the people well.

00:02:40.153 --> 00:02:43.088
The people are directly involved.

00:02:43.088 --> 00:02:46.433
Now, what are maybe some of the negatives?

00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:49.984
Well, it can get logistically difficult.

00:02:49.984 --> 00:02:52.702
We talked about a small town,

00:02:52.702 --> 00:02:55.019
but what if the town
gets a little bit bigger?

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.375
Or what we're dealing with a state?

00:02:56.375 --> 00:02:57.940
Or we're dealing with a country

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.370
where we're talking
about tens of thousands

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.445
or hundreds of thousands or millions

00:03:02.445 --> 00:03:04.369
or tens of millions of people?

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:06.008
How do you get all of those people

00:03:06.008 --> 00:03:08.898
to weigh in on an issue,
even logistically?

00:03:08.898 --> 00:03:10.426
How do they get informed about it,

00:03:10.426 --> 00:03:13.571
and are they even prepared
to weigh in on those issues?

00:03:13.571 --> 00:03:15.344
Sure, if you're in a
town you can think about

00:03:15.344 --> 00:03:17.149
whether an intersection should be there

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:18.888
or whether they should
put a stop light there,

00:03:18.888 --> 00:03:21.749
but if we're talking
about matters of national

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:24.359
or international importance influencing

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:25.884
hundreds of millions of people,

00:03:25.884 --> 00:03:27.983
can you depend on people to be informed

00:03:27.983 --> 00:03:31.053
about the intricacies
of the banking system

00:03:31.053 --> 00:03:33.886
or the military or foreign policy?

00:03:34.933 --> 00:03:38.247
And so this is really a
question of, does this scale?

00:03:38.247 --> 00:03:41.677
And there really aren't any
good examples in history

00:03:41.677 --> 00:03:46.132
of direct democracy
scaling in significant ways

00:03:46.132 --> 00:03:48.695
beyond fairly small groups of people.

00:03:48.695 --> 00:03:50.826
In the United States the biggest scale

00:03:50.826 --> 00:03:53.590
where you might see
this are in things like

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.989
ballot measures at the
city or the state level

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:58.718
where people are directly voting

00:03:58.718 --> 00:04:01.262
on certain measures or certain laws.

00:04:01.262 --> 00:04:03.746
But even there, it's a limited scope

00:04:03.746 --> 00:04:06.678
for what the people will
actually weigh in on.

00:04:06.678 --> 00:04:08.678
Now, the next category that we talk about

00:04:08.678 --> 00:04:10.761
is a pluralist democracy.

00:04:11.636 --> 00:04:13.426
Pluralism is referring to the idea

00:04:13.426 --> 00:04:15.537
of many different parties.

00:04:15.537 --> 00:04:18.563
Same root as the word
plural, you have many things.

00:04:18.563 --> 00:04:21.977
So you have many different parties

00:04:21.977 --> 00:04:23.886
and many different competing interests

00:04:23.886 --> 00:04:28.053
that are going to have a
vigorous debate with each other

00:04:28.927 --> 00:04:31.602
on deciding what are the best ideas.

00:04:31.602 --> 00:04:34.798
And what are examples of
pluralist democracies?

00:04:34.798 --> 00:04:36.682
If you think about the United States,

00:04:36.682 --> 00:04:38.703
there are many different interest groups.

00:04:38.703 --> 00:04:40.554
You can think about all of
the different lobbyists,

00:04:40.554 --> 00:04:42.532
all of the different groups that represent

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:44.732
different types of
people trying to convince

00:04:44.732 --> 00:04:47.257
members of Congress, either
at the national level,

00:04:47.257 --> 00:04:50.692
or even at the state level
that their interest is right.

00:04:50.692 --> 00:04:54.489
Even within Congress, even
though you have two major parties

00:04:54.489 --> 00:04:55.918
you can have different factions

00:04:55.918 --> 00:04:58.521
that are really trying to argue it out.

00:04:58.521 --> 00:05:02.346
Now, what are the benefits
of a pluralist democracy?

00:05:02.346 --> 00:05:04.236
Well, you can imagine that because

00:05:04.236 --> 00:05:08.508
there is this vigorous debate,
maybe the good ideas surface.

00:05:08.508 --> 00:05:10.091
Good ideas surface.

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:17.246
You don't have domination
by just one party.

00:05:17.246 --> 00:05:21.413
No one group or a small
group of people domination.

00:05:28.374 --> 00:05:30.463
But then, on the other side of it,

00:05:30.463 --> 00:05:33.663
maybe they're some negatives,
what might those be?

00:05:33.663 --> 00:05:36.782
Well, maybe all of this
debate and argument

00:05:36.782 --> 00:05:41.075
is very inefficient, maybe
it's slow decision making.

00:05:41.075 --> 00:05:44.992
Slow decisions, or at an
extreme, no decisions.

00:05:46.568 --> 00:05:48.248
Some things like gridlock

00:05:48.248 --> 00:05:50.129
because people can't agree to things,

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:51.637
that in order for anything to get done,

00:05:51.637 --> 00:05:54.045
you have to make too many people happy

00:05:54.045 --> 00:05:55.565
and they all have their interests.

00:05:55.565 --> 00:05:57.222
Maybe the opposite of good ideas surface.

00:05:57.222 --> 00:05:59.738
Maybe good ideas die
because it's very hard

00:05:59.738 --> 00:06:02.219
to make everyone happy.

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:04.365
Now, the last category
that we're gonna talk about

00:06:04.365 --> 00:06:07.713
is the idea of an elite democracy,

00:06:07.713 --> 00:06:11.131
and this is where you have
more limited participation.

00:06:11.131 --> 00:06:13.268
So in some ways it's almost the opposite

00:06:13.268 --> 00:06:15.315
of a participatory democracy.

00:06:15.315 --> 00:06:18.815
So this is limited, limited participation.

00:06:20.678 --> 00:06:22.517
And even though I gave ancient Athens

00:06:22.517 --> 00:06:24.878
as an example of a
participatory democracy,

00:06:24.878 --> 00:06:29.205
it really was more of an elite
democracy where the people

00:06:29.205 --> 00:06:31.383
had the time and the
influence and the money,

00:06:31.383 --> 00:06:33.474
those were the ones who
were really weighing in

00:06:33.474 --> 00:06:36.169
on the issues of ancient Athens.

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:38.811
And if you were to go
to the Roman republic,

00:06:38.811 --> 00:06:43.539
the Roman senators, these
were, once again, elite men.

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:45.636
So what would you think are benefits

00:06:45.636 --> 00:06:47.469
of an elite democracy?

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:52.482
Well, one might be that
these elites, so to speak,

00:06:52.482 --> 00:06:56.839
maybe they are more educated
than the general public

00:06:56.839 --> 00:07:01.635
and so that allows them to
make more informed decisions,

00:07:01.635 --> 00:07:03.949
especially on things
that are quite complex

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:06.728
that would be hard for
everyone to weigh in on.

00:07:06.728 --> 00:07:09.256
If you're going to change
a new accounting standard,

00:07:09.256 --> 00:07:11.534
or think about how do you relegate

00:07:11.534 --> 00:07:13.397
the telecommunications industry

00:07:13.397 --> 00:07:16.678
or some very sophisticated
trade negotiation

00:07:16.678 --> 00:07:20.729
or foreign policy negotiation,
that education might help.

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:23.479
And maybe it's also more decisive

00:07:24.471 --> 00:07:28.025
than either one of the
pluralist or the participatory.

00:07:28.025 --> 00:07:30.276
The participatory they
might be able to appeal

00:07:30.276 --> 00:07:33.688
to maybe baser instincts, just,
you know, people's passions

00:07:33.688 --> 00:07:36.476
while the pluralists, since
you have all of these groups

00:07:36.476 --> 00:07:38.734
competing even if something makes sense

00:07:38.734 --> 00:07:40.793
they might not be able
to make that decision,

00:07:40.793 --> 00:07:43.106
but if you have a smaller,
more limited group,

00:07:43.106 --> 00:07:46.210
limited participation, maybe
they can make these decisions

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:49.454
a little bit clearer, but
what are the negatives here?

00:07:49.454 --> 00:07:52.486
Well, the clearest negative is, well,

00:07:52.486 --> 00:07:55.488
maybe this goes against the
whole idea of a democracy.

00:07:55.488 --> 00:07:57.890
If it's all about the elites,
maybe they do a good job

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:00.975
at truly representing the
interests of the people,

00:08:00.975 --> 00:08:03.317
but maybe they are good at representing

00:08:03.317 --> 00:08:04.969
the interests of the elite.

00:08:04.969 --> 00:08:08.219
So do they really represent the people?

00:08:11.535 --> 00:08:15.285
Is this a democracy where
the people are sovereign,

00:08:15.285 --> 00:08:18.063
where the people rule, or
is this an oligarchy where

00:08:18.063 --> 00:08:22.230
only a few people rule and they
rule in their own interests?

00:08:23.204 --> 00:08:25.085
And so after watching this video,

00:08:25.085 --> 00:08:27.058
look at the world around you.

00:08:27.058 --> 00:08:28.648
Think about, in the United States,

00:08:28.648 --> 00:08:31.073
or whatever country you're watching from,

00:08:31.073 --> 00:08:33.761
what elements of a participatory
democracy do you see?

00:08:33.761 --> 00:08:35.946
What elements of a pluralist democracy,

00:08:35.946 --> 00:08:39.376
and what elements of an
elite democracy do you see?

00:08:39.376 --> 00:08:41.499
And as we'll see in other videos,

00:08:41.499 --> 00:08:45.838
these dimensions of democracy
were vigorously debated

00:08:45.838 --> 00:08:48.206
by the Founding Fathers
when they thought about

00:08:48.206 --> 00:08:50.889
whether to ratify the Constitution.

00:08:50.889 --> 00:08:52.922
We'll see this debate when we look at

00:08:52.922 --> 00:08:54.823
the Anti-Federalist Papers, especially

00:08:54.823 --> 00:08:57.780
we'll look closely at Brutus number one.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.990
We'll see this debate when we
look at the Federalist Papers,

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:04.528
especially Federalist number
10, written by James Madison

00:09:04.528 --> 00:09:07.138
and I'll let you decide,
when we look at that,

00:09:07.138 --> 00:09:10.419
who was right and what
flavors of democracy

00:09:10.419 --> 00:09:14.558
are most dominant in the United
States at different levels.
