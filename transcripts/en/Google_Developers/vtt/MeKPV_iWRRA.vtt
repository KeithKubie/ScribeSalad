00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.840
JOANNA SMITH: Hey, guys.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.800
I'm Joanna Smith.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.920
And I'm a Developer Programs
Engineer here at Google+.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.040
And today I brought my two
favorite desk mates to help me

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.790
present some upcoming changes
to the Activities API.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:24.960
CHRIS CARTLAND: So, hi.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.960
I'm Chris Cartland.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.260
And I'm a Developer
Programs Engineer

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.694
on the Google+ platform.

00:00:29.694 --> 00:00:30.620
GUS CLASS: Hi.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:31.560
I'm Gus Class.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.780
And I'm a Developer Advocate.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.450
And I work with Joanna
and Cartland.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.750
JOANNA SMITH: So many of
you might have seen my

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.600
announcement that I sent out
about two weeks ago and then

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.880
reposted last week.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.120
So we've got a few small changes
that are coming very

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.290
soon, actually.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.680
So we want to talk to you
about these changes and

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.510
actually show you really like
what the difference is and

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.130
help you get prepared
for them.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.835
So, Cartland, take it away.

00:00:54.835 --> 00:00:56.060
CHRIS CARTLAND: Great.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.010
So there's going to be some
changes coming out with the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.670
way that Activities return photo
albums and articles.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:04.959
They're very simple changes.

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:07.580
You'll still be able to
get the same content.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.140
But we're packaging them
up in a nicer way.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.360
And we're going to talk
about that right now.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.010
We're going to first show you
what it looks like today and

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.150
then show you what it
looks like soon.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.960
And then we'll show you what
happens if you don't update

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.990
your application and the API
changes to show the same

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.450
content but in a slightly
different format.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.180
JOANNA SMITH: And one thing is,
don't worry about having

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.480
to take notes and write all this
stuff down because, of

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.170
course, we've made it
available online.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.770
You can find the link on the
Google+ event, the GDL event,

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.470
or the YouTube event, straight
back to my email where I

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.120
discuss these changes
in-depth.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.710
CHRIS CARTLAND: Great.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.280
So this is just a simple demo
application that has two

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.790
pieces of JSON.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.190
One is the old response that
you can get today.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.050
And one is the new that
you will get once

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.750
the API rolls out.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:03.570
So if you render the old
response, what you'll get is a

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.390
series of objects, which starts
with an album which

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.070
contains the title, which here
is Random Album, which is a

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.780
very creative name.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.860
Great job, Gus.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.850
And then after that, you get
a series of objects which

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.890
represent the images.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.180
And that contains a URL for an
image that we fetched here and

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.756
then also a full-sized image.

00:02:23.756 --> 00:02:26.230
GUS CLASS: And so what you're
seeing here is just a full

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.550
album and all the attachments
that are associated with it.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.090
And these are all just images.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.515
And then at the very end is an
article as well, Cartland.

00:02:34.515 --> 00:02:35.360
CHRIS CARTLAND: Great.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.400
So this last one here
at the bottom is a

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.570
different type of activity.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.130
It's an article.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.990
Again, it has an object
for the title,

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.610
which we've shown here--

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:44.990
Fancy Scrolling Sites--

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:50.650
and then an image URL that we
then just put on the web page.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.820
So that's what it looks
like today.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:03:01.280
The new response is going to
take the images within the

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.680
activity and put them actually
inside the object in the JSON.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.090
So rather than returning a
separate object with the URLs,

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.230
we're just going to package that
in where they logically

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.800
make sense.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.850
So if I run the new version,
we still get the same

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:18.340
information.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.070
The same photos are returned.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:26.450
However, in the JSON, this
album is just a field.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:27.780
The name of the album--
sorry-- is a field.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.000
And then within that, there
are thumbnails.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.190
And this list of thumbnails
contains URLs for the images

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.815
that you want to retrieve.

00:03:34.815 --> 00:03:37.490
JOANNA SMITH: So, Cartland,
if all it is is a list of

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.490
thumbnails, why does the first
one look like a full image

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:41.460
instead of a thumbnail?

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:42.740
CHRIS CARTLAND: Good question.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.020
So the first image that is
returned is actually the album

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.700
cover, so it's treated
as another thumbnail.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.376
But by default, it will return
larger than the others just to

00:03:53.376 --> 00:03:55.194
make it convenient to show
the cover separately.

00:03:55.194 --> 00:03:56.406
JOANNA SMITH: Oh, OK.

00:03:56.406 --> 00:03:59.640
CHRIS CARTLAND: And again, at
the bottom, the article again

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.990
returns the title.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:09.310
And then within the JSON
object is the image.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.020
And the image again has a
URL that you can fetch.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.520
So all of the content
is the same.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.579
But the new format is
better packaged.

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.240
So quickly, I want to show you
what happens if we take the

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:31.430
code from the new API, and we're
going to put it into the

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.300
old function and see
what happens.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.850
So I just copied the new JSON
into the old function.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.510
And I'm going to render it.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.340
And you'll see that none of
the images showed up.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.270
And that's not because the
images aren't there and you're

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.460
not getting them anymore.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.270
It's just that the information's
been moved

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.520
around into a different place.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.740
We'll document how you can make
these updates so that

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.825
when we say render new, they'll
still look beautiful.

00:04:59.825 --> 00:05:02.330
GUS CLASS: Great
demo, Cartland.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.050
So yeah, with these upcoming
changes, it probably won't

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.100
break everything that
you've done.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.690
But you'll have to be aware that
if images stop showing

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.556
up, you will have to make some
revisions to your code.

00:05:16.556 --> 00:05:18.750
JOANNA SMITH: OK, so when you
were illustrating this, the

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.540
JavaScript that we were using to
form these tools, was that

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.240
anything special that's
available online?

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.785
Or was that just like
the equivalent of an

00:05:24.785 --> 00:05:25.920
app that you created?

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.750
GUS CLASS: So the JavaScript's
actually really simple.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.480
I would hardly call it an app.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.610
All it does is parse the JSON.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.330
And then it actually retrieves
attributes from the object

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.750
that's parsed.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:36.590
JOANNA SMITH: OK.

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.110
And you used different
JavaScript for each of the

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.020
buttons, correct?

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.280
GUS CLASS: Exactly.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.020
JOANNA SMITH: So those are the
changes that we need to

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.530
highlighting?

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:43.173
GUS CLASS: OK.

00:05:43.173 --> 00:05:45.000
Yeah, sure.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.700
So, yeah, there's a render
old button and then

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:47.350
a render new button.

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:51.980
And those actually will access
those objects in different

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.265
ways because of the changes with
the attachments within

00:05:55.265 --> 00:05:55.820
the images.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.060
JOANNA SMITH: OK.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.240
Cool.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.220
GUS CLASS: So, while we listen
for questions, I'll show you

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.420
another app that I've just
been playing around with.

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:09.420
And all this does is it uses the
Activities List API, and

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:13.520
then actually retrieves items
that you search for, and then

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.770
graphs them over time.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.220
So right now is probably a great
time to ask questions if

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.930
you guys have them for
our Office Hours.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.620
And Joanna will be--

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.430
JOANNA SMITH: Monitoring
as always.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:27.960
GUS CLASS: Monitoring
as they go.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.300
JOANNA SMITH: I have two
questions already.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.385
But we're going to go ahead and
wait for more to come in.

00:06:31.385 --> 00:06:32.190
GUS CLASS: Cool.

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:36.120
So here is actually-- like, I
perform this query, and then I

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.500
render this graph.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:43.730
And then you can actually see
the count of results as they

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:45.970
appear over time in my graph.

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:50.770
And I've got another fun thing
that I added to it where I

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:57.690
actually render all of the
activity within the post by

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:59.410
type on this graph.

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:04.590
So here you can see in the
middle of the post is this

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:05.980
object that's note.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.800
And it doesn't like to render.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.570
But, yeah, if you actually
look, there's various

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:17.340
attributes that I'm pulling to
kind of bridge together the

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:18.970
little piece of this
as a graph.

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:23.460
So because I'm just using the
display name property, this

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.610
app would not be affected by
the attachments changes.

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:27.370
JOANNA SMITH: Oh, cool.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:29.640
So this is an example
of how small these

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:30.640
changes are, right?

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:30.905
GUS CLASS: Yep.

00:07:30.905 --> 00:07:32.700
JOANNA SMITH: It doesn't
affect anything else?

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:33.290
GUS CLASS: Exactly.

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:34.480
JOANNA SMITH: Awesome.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:38.420
OK, so one question that I've
actually heard multiple times

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:40.540
throughout the last two weeks
that I'm really glad was asked

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:42.990
on the G+ event was
asked by Gerwin.

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:45.540
And he wanted to know--

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:48.180
is the album attachment
currently returns the first

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.110
few photos, about 14 of them.

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:53.480
And he wanted to know if now if
he posted a bigger album,

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.740
this will change,
and it'll start

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.290
returning the entire album.

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:58.440
And I think that this is
actually a further reaching

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:01.300
question than we realized
because these changes don't

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.440
actually affect any behavior
of the API.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.680
We are only adjusting where data
is stored and how you can

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:07.630
retrieve it.

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:08.750
So we're cleaning
things up a bit.

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:11.370
We're not actually modifying
anything major.

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:12.510
Is that correct, Gus?

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:13.840
GUS CLASS: Yep.

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.340
There were no significant
changes such as that within

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:16.990
this update.

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:18.700
JOANNA SMITH: So expect all
behavior to be the same.

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.080
Just look for it
in a new place.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.730
And then the second question
that was posted was a little

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:27.940
bit off topic.

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:29.050
It's from Hans Moser.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:32.400
And he wanted some advice
on his own app.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.100
And for this, we don't really
have advice for particular

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.020
implementation details when
you're building an app.

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:39.360
But we do have a forum.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:43.260
And Stack Overflow, we monitor
for specific questions.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.350
So always feel free to go into
these to ask your peer group

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:47.270
for advice as well.

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:49.520
And then when you come down to
a particular problem, we'll

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.940
definitely be there to help
answer those questions.

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:53.230
But good luck, Hans.

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:56.890
And I hope you'll
use our forum.

00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:02.188
And I'm just waiting for updates
if we have anymore.

00:09:02.188 --> 00:09:03.780
GUS CLASS: So, yeah, we'll just
hang out for a few more

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:07.797
minutes and wait for any
questions on the event or on

00:09:07.797 --> 00:09:08.650
the YouTube feed.

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:10.260
JOANNA SMITH: Yeah, we had a
really quick demo this time.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:11.650
GUS CLASS: Yeah, a quick
demo this time.

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:13.300
It's short and sweet.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.510
CHRIS CARTLAND: But maybe next
time, we should make the API

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:16.615
more difficult.

00:09:16.615 --> 00:09:18.080
GUS CLASS: Yeah, that's
a good idea.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.780
We'll make it really hard.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.690
And then we'll have a really
long GDL session.

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:22.516
JOANNA SMITH: Hours.

00:09:22.516 --> 00:09:24.440
Hours long, so all your
questions get in.

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:29.880
So, while we wait, I guess
I'll go over this week's

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.392
announcements, which are
actually really easy and short

00:09:32.392 --> 00:09:33.440
and sweet as well.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.430
Watch out for this
coming change.

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:37.232
That's my only announcement.

00:09:37.232 --> 00:09:38.468
GUS CLASS: Yep.

00:09:38.468 --> 00:09:39.960
JOANNA SMITH: It's a
pretty easy week.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.400
GUS CLASS: Yep.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.780
JOANNA SMITH: So let's--

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:50.547
we can always talk.

00:09:50.547 --> 00:09:54.030
GUS CLASS: So, yeah, I mean,
these coming changes really

00:09:54.030 --> 00:10:00.450
should not affect people's
apps in most cases.

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:05.230
The various things to be really
cognizant of are the

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.320
changes to albums and the
changes to articles.

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:16.030
If you've adjusted for changes
before along these lines,

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:19.750
there should really be just a
few minutes to less than an

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:21.470
hour to actually address
the updates.

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:23.100
JOANNA SMITH: And if you come
across a problem that's taking

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:26.990
you more than an hour maximum
to solve, you should be

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:29.250
posting and asking us questions
about what's going

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:32.290
on, Because we've all made
adjustments for these already,

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:37.080
and we've been able to do
them very, very quickly.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.410
So, no questions
are coming in.

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:39.642
MALE SPEAKER: One question
on YouTube.

00:10:39.642 --> 00:10:41.980
JOANNA SMITH: On YouTube?

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:43.695
CHRIS CARTLAND: So we just got
a question from YouTube?

00:10:43.695 --> 00:10:45.230
JOANNA SMITH: Which is
still not showing up.

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:47.330
OK, here we go.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:50.660
Gizem wants to create an app
that allows him to post on his

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:53.610
blog and have that show up
in his Google+ feed.

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:56.110
So this sounds like a great
feature request

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:57.750
for our issue tracker.

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:02.030
If you go to developers.googl
e.com/plus/support, you can

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:04.090
actually submit all of
your great ideas.

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:06.390
And I personally have to
go over all of them.

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:09.730
So, it's what I do after GDL.

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:11.880
So please give me all of
your feature requests.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:12.900
Give me all of your ideas.

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:16.060
And I'll pass them along to the
right people and let you

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:17.310
know about their status.

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:22.420
CHRIS CARTLAND: Awesome.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:27.150
JOANNA SMITH: And, of course, if
your question doesn't come

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:29.530
in by the time we end this
broadcast, we'll be checking

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:31.940
them over the next week to
be able to respond to any

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.190
follow-ups.

00:11:41.492 --> 00:11:44.198
All right, I think
we can call it.

00:11:44.198 --> 00:11:46.200
GUS CLASS: All right.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.040
Thanks, everyone,
for watching.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.210
JOANNA SMITH: And post
your questions.

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:49.310
I'll answer them later.

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:50.560
GUS CLASS: We'll see you
in the next GDL.
