00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.120
Every living organism we know of requires
water to survive - it's part of the reason

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.510
we look so feverishly for water on other planets
across the universe, and consume it consistently

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.469
every day here on Earth. So what would happen
to your body if you stopped drinking water?

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.800
Of course, when we say 'water' we're including
all fluids which simply contain water - like

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.350
juices, pop, or tea. Much like the desire
to breath in oxygen, thirst is a survival

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.960
instinct. H20 is the most abundant molecule
in the human body making up, on average, 65%

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.340
of an adult. As a universal solvent, it carries
nutrients and hormones through the body, regulates

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.590
body temperature, cushions our joints and
even lubricates our eyes. You produce around

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.809
1.5 litres of urine every day, with another
litre lost from breathing, sweating and...pooping.

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.500
So it's essential that the body replaces this
liquid.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.210
The thirst centre of the brain is located
in the hypothalamus, and is constantly using

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.940
sensors in your blood vessels to monitor the
amount of sodium and other substances in your

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.149
body. For example, if you sweat too much,
your blood volume and pressure fall. The brain

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.550
then detects this change and creates the urge
to drink something, NOW! So what happens if

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.600
you are unable to satisfy this thirst?

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.650
The initial signs of dehydration are the obvious
dry mouth, following which your urine becomes

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.750
darker with a stronger odor, as your body
attempts to conserve more fluids. The lack

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.520
of H20 then begins to affect your brain - you
may feel light headed, have a slower response

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.799
time and decreased ability to feel pain. In
fact, when you're dehydrated, your brain tissue

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.220
literally shrinks. In studies observing hydrated
vs. dehydrated participants, the same task

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.030
required more brain power and oxygen in dehydrated
individuals compared to those fully hydrated.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.119
After a day or two with no fluids you'll stop
peeing all together, have trouble swallowing,

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.310
suffer from muscle spasms and likely experience
nausea - after all, your body can survive

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.700
without food much longer, and attention to
digestion is not a priority at this point.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.390
Eventually, victims may become delirious with
severely impaired brain function. Interestingly,

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.549
studies looking at elderly patients who suffer
from delirium, found that many are simply

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.979
suffering from chronic dehydration in the
first place. After even more time without

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.500
water, the blood stops flowing to your skin,
reducing heat loss but increasing your core

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.719
body temperature. This can lead to a grey-blueish
tinge to your skin. Beyond 3-5 days without

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:09.250
water, and your body will begin to shut down
it's organs, and eventually the brain.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.730
Of course, unlike the plentiful oxygen we
breath, only 2.5% of all Earth's water is

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.569
fresh; most of which is locked up in glaciers,
ice caps and underground lakes known as aquifers,

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.620
leaving less than 1% available for drinking.
And most of this water is actually used to

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.349
grow crops; approximately 500 billion litres
of freshwater is used daily for agriculture

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:32.470
in the USA alone, with another 500 billion
litres to cool electric power plants. And

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.550
as our personal drinking sources become increasingly
contaminated, over 783 million people on earth

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.690
are unable to access clean water.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.910
Scientists around the world are trying to
find solutions to this problem - from attempts

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.650
to remove salt from ocean water, tap into
underground aquifers and creating innovative

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.390
water filtration systems. If we look to space,
NASA has developed technology for astronauts

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.879
to turn their urine into water more pure than
what we drink on earth. But we can't just

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:00.840
rely on science and technology - perhaps the
solution relies on us as a species to understand

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.980
and contribute to this global water crisis.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.370
If you want to help in the mission to end
global thirst, join in World Water Day on

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.590
March 22nd. There are a lot of really amazing
projects out there, like Water.org or even

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.750
the awesome UNICEF app which donates 1 day
of clean water to child in need, for every

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.180
10 minutes you put your phone down. We'll
leave links in the description for these and

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.890
other great water charities. Small investments
really do make a huge difference.

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.209
We'll be donating all the proceeds from this
video to a water project close to us called

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.310
Morocco 5 Villages - so thanks for supporting
and watching. And subscribe for more weekly

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.160
science videos!
