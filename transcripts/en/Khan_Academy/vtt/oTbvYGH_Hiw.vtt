00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.660
In the US, we
don't directly vote

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.820
for our president
or vice president.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.460
Instead, we use something
called the Electoral College.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.100
So when you show up to vote on
Election Day-- and an election

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.850
day will happen in November
of an election year.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.420
And it could happen as
early as November 2,

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.000
and it could happen
as late as November 8.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.710
And it's going to be the
Tuesday after the first Monday

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.350
in the month.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.750
So it'll be November 2 if the
first Monday is November 1,

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.930
and it'll be November 8 if the
first Monday is November 7.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.959
And so you go on
election day, and you

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:39.500
will see a ballot that will have
the presidential candidates.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.475
It'll have their parties there.

00:00:40.475 --> 00:00:41.940
It will have the vice
presidential candidates,

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.620
and you'll vote for one of them.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.040
But in actuality, when you
are voting for Candidate A--

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.070
and let's say Candidate A is a
Democrat-- you're not actually

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.540
voting for Candidate
A. You're actually

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.260
voting for a slate
of electors who

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.605
promise to vote
for that candidate.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.110
And it isn't in most
states proportional

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.740
based on what
proportion of people

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.420
vote for one
candidate or another.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.280
In most of the states, except
for Maine and Nebraska,

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.400
it is a winner take all system.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.130
So what do I mean by that?

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.580
So right here, you have the
breakdown of the United States,

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.960
by state, of how many electors
words each state gets.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.900
And the number of
electors is essentially

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.260
the number of congressmen
that that state has.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.810
For example, California
has two senators.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.390
Every state has two senators.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.186
California has two senators
and 53 congressmen.

00:01:38.186 --> 00:01:40.560
And those of you who aren't
familiar with it, every state

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.610
gets two senators, and the
House of Representatives

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.000
is dictated by population.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.600
California is a huge state, two
senators, 53 representatives.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.310
You have Texas, two senators
and it has 32 representatives.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.550
You go to Louisiana,
you have two senators

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.410
and you have seven
representatives.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.540
So the electors
per state is based

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.480
on the total number
of congressmen,

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.400
so the number of senators plus
the number of representatives.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.350
That's what gives us 55 in
California, nine in Louisiana,

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.542
34 in Texas.

00:02:15.542 --> 00:02:17.000
But what's interesting
here is it's

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.160
a winner take all
system in every state

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.030
except for Nebraska and Maine.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.480
In every other state, if I
get 51% of the vote in Texas,

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.080
I get all 34 electoral votes
in the Electoral College.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.000
If I get 51% or even
if I get 50.1%, just

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.440
a slight majority of
the votes in California,

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.740
I will get all of the
votes for California

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.590
in the Electoral College.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.460
And in general, or in
actuality, the president

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.095
is whoever gets the majority
of the electoral votes

00:02:53.095 --> 00:02:53.970
in the United States.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.060
And right now,
that threshold is,

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.990
or that magic number--
you could think of it

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:03.550
that way-- is 270
Electoral College votes.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.540
If no candidate is able to hit
this threshold of 270 Electoral

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.582
College votes, then it
will go to the US Congress.

00:03:14.582 --> 00:03:16.290
And in the US Congress,
it's interesting,

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.190
because it isn't one
congressman, one vote.

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.307
Or actually, I should say the
US House of Representatives.

00:03:21.307 --> 00:03:23.140
It'll go to the US House
of Representatives.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.530
And it won't be one
representative, one vote.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.290
What will happen is
the representatives

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.090
in each state will
vote together,

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.930
and each state will
get only one vote.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.710
So in a tiebreaker,
the big states really,

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.130
really lose out,
because in a tiebreaker,

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.640
Texas will get only one vote.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.510
California will get one vote.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.000
And Alaska will get one
vote, and Rhode Island

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.900
will get one vote.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.280
So Rhode Island will have just
as much say in a tiebreaker

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.930
as California will over
who will be president.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.100
Then they'll just keep
voting until someone

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.154
gets a simple majority
of the votes by state.

00:03:59.154 --> 00:04:00.570
Now, there's one
other twist here.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.150
It's that the District of
Columbia-- Washington, DC right

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.170
over here-- in Congress
gets no representatives.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.340
They have no senators, and
they have no representatives.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.760
But they do get
three electoral votes

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.366
when it comes to deciding
who is going to be president.

00:04:15.366 --> 00:04:17.074
Now, you might already
be getting a sense

00:04:17.074 --> 00:04:20.390
here that maybe this winner
take all system might lead

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.330
to some distortions, and the
biggest distortion of all

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:30.250
is you can imagine a candidate
who wins the popular vote

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.920
and loses the election or
loses in the Electoral College.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.010
And you might think, well,
gee, how can that happen?

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.360
And the way to think about
it is, imagine someone--

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.290
let's say someone
gets-- with the states

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.630
that they win, they
get huge majorities.

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.610
So let's say there's a
conservative candidate,

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.370
and he or she gets
huge majorities

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.630
in the states they win.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.570
80% in Texas.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.630
They get 80% in Mississippi.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.380
They get 80% in Oklahoma.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.050
The get huge majorities in
the states that they win.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.560
And the states that they
lose, they barely lose.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.300
And they barely lose
those really big states.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.960
So let's say in Florida, that
candidate gets 49% of the vote.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.869
So they had a lot
of votes in Florida,

00:05:15.869 --> 00:05:16.910
but not enough to win it.

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.910
The other person,
let's say, gets 51%.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.220
All 27 go to the
other candidate.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.700
Let's say the same thing
happens in California.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.970
That candidate got
49% of the vote.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.640
The opponent, let's say,
gets 51% of the vote.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.135
All 55 go to California.

00:05:32.135 --> 00:05:34.470
You get no credit for that 49%.

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.300
You get no credit for
that 49% in Florida.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.054
So in this situation,
this candidate

00:05:39.054 --> 00:05:40.720
might actually end
up with the majority,

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.610
barely losing the
states they lose,

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.470
and trouncing the other
candidate in the states

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.610
that they win, but despite
that, actually getting fewer

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.299
Electoral College votes.

00:05:50.299 --> 00:05:52.340
Now, there's a few
clarifications I want to make,

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.430
especially ones that have
confused me in the past.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.980
One of them is because you have
the same number of Electoral

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.100
College votes as you have US
representatives plus senators,

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.960
there's kind of this feeling
that maybe each district

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.350
sends its own elector
to the state capital

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.780
to decide who the president is.

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.410
And it doesn't
quite work that way.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.910
So this right here is
the panel of electors

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.080
for Louisiana in 2008.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.720
And you can see right over
here, each of the parties

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.270
have their own
slate of electors.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.110
And these are either decided
by the party themselves,

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.010
or they're decided by
the candidates' teams.

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:33.237
And even though you have
someone here for each district

00:06:33.237 --> 00:06:35.070
and then you have these
at-large candidates,

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.190
it's not like-- let's
take a situation.

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:38.690
This actually
happened in Louisiana,

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.400
where John McCain got a
majority of the state.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.400
So John McCain and Sarah Palin
got a majority of the state.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.200
It's not the case
that-- let's say

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.624
in the second district,
which is New Orleans,

00:06:51.624 --> 00:06:53.540
let's say that the second
district, a majority

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.790
of the people actually
voted for Barack Obama.

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:59.380
It is not the case that
Kenneth Garrett in 2008

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.820
would have been
the chosen elector.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.740
Even though they divide
things by district

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.406
and they have these
at-large candidates,

00:07:06.406 --> 00:07:08.930
it is actually a
state-wide election.

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.200
So they don't look at who
won each of the districts.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.660
They just say, look,
John McCain and Sarah

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.640
Palin won the entire state.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:20.030
So all of these
electors are the ones

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:22.710
that are going to go to the
state capital in December

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:26.700
and decide who they want
to pledge their vote for.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:30.572
So even if Obama won just the
Second Congressional District,

00:07:30.572 --> 00:07:33.030
that's not how it's thought
about in the Electoral College.

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:35.200
It's just a state-wide election.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.070
McCain got the
majority of the state.

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:40.360
All of the electors will be
chosen from McCain's slate

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.070
or from the Republican
Party slate.

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:45.160
And then they're going to
go to the state capital.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.340
In the case of Louisiana,
it would be Baton Rouge.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.030
And they will decide who they
want to pledge their votes to.

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:52.240
And all of the electors
in all of the states

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.210
go to their designated location,
usually the state capital,

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:56.210
on the same day.

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:58.594
And usually that is
some day in December.

00:07:58.594 --> 00:08:00.760
And they pick the president,
although by that point,

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.570
everyone knows who
the president is,

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:05.000
because the actual election
was in early November.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.100
And people know which
way the votes went

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:11.420
and which way the actual
Electoral College votes went.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.750
Now, I did mention that
there are two states that

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:16.770
don't do this winner take
all, Nebraska and Maine.

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:19.300
And in Nebraska and
Maine, when you go vote,

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.410
it really is by
congressional district.

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:23.640
Nebraska has three
congressional districts.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.174
So in those three congressional
districts, if one of them

00:08:26.174 --> 00:08:28.340
goes to the Democrat and
two goes to the Republican,

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.610
then they'll have one
electoral vote for the Democrat

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:32.190
and two for the Republican.

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:33.809
And then they have
two at-large votes

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:36.200
that are decided the same
way, in kind of the winner

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.059
take all basis.

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:39.510
If you get 51% of the
vote on a statewide basis,

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:41.330
you get the two at-large votes.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:43.890
Same thing for
Maine, but Maine has

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:45.330
two congressional districts.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:48.270
So two of the congressional
districts could go either way.

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:51.720
And then the at-large are
based on a state-wide vote.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.670
Now, you could imagine the
other kind of unfair thing

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:57.860
here, other than the popular
vote versus the Electoral

00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:59.010
College vote.

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:02.570
You could imagine it makes
some states better represented

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:03.750
than others.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:07.820
So if you just divide population
by the number of electors,

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:10.105
you see the larger
states, each elector

00:09:10.105 --> 00:09:12.090
is representing many,
many more people.

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:13.340
This is California right here.

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:16.350
Each elector is representing
over 600,000 people.

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:19.000
And in the smaller states--
this is Wyoming right here--

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.436
each elector is representing
under 200,000 people.

00:09:24.436 --> 00:09:25.810
So in Wyoming,
people are getting

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:28.650
kind of three times the
representation as they would

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:30.870
in California on
a per capita vote.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.870
But what makes it even a
little bit more skewed,

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.800
because it's winner take all
and the candidates aren't silly

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.550
and they want to make
sure that they spend

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:39.841
their money and their visits
and their time in the most

00:09:39.841 --> 00:09:43.340
leveragable way, it actually
creates this weird scenario

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:46.110
where candidates
will often ignore

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:48.165
huge parts of the population.

00:09:48.165 --> 00:09:50.040
And they ignore them
because those huge parts

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.430
of the population are unlikely
to swing one way or the other.

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:56.430
So for example,
California is very

00:09:56.430 --> 00:10:03.130
reliably Democratic and Texas
is very reliably Republican.

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:05.770
So this right here-- this is
a fascinating graph, at least

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:10.930
in my mind-- it shows where
George W. Bush and John

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:15.200
Kerry spent the last five
weeks of the 2004 election.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.450
Let me close that right there.

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:23.074
This top graph shows where
they actually spent their time,

00:10:23.074 --> 00:10:24.490
so each of these
little hands here

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:26.560
is a visit in those
final five weeks.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.050
And each of these
dollar signs is

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:31.400
a million dollars spent on
marketing and advertising,

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.900
on ads and whatever
else, in those states.

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:37.450
And you can see, California and
Texas, the two biggest states,

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:39.778
they didn't spend enough
money to the threshold

00:10:39.778 --> 00:10:41.236
to get dollar a
sign written there.

00:10:41.236 --> 00:10:42.735
So they didn't even
spend $1,000,000

00:10:42.735 --> 00:10:43.710
on these huge states.

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:46.940
They only had a few
visits to California,

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:51.690
and Texas had no visits
in the final five weeks.

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:53.470
So what happens
is that candidates

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:55.860
spend a disproportionate
amount of attention and money

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.230
in the states that are
more likely to swing

00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:59.150
one way or another.

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:01.840
So the people in
Florida or in Ohio--

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:04.970
so this is Ohio and Florida--
got a ton more attention,

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:08.440
especially on a per person
basis, than the people in Texas

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.990
did.
