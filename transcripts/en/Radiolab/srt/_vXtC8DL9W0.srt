1
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,450
You're listening to radio
lab from public radio, w.N y.

2
00:00:08,451 --> 00:00:12,770
S t engine, n. P. R. What
we have over the criminal.

3
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,420
The criminal actually thinks he's
destroyed. It will be evidence

4
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:17,543
[inaudible]

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:20,320
[inaudible]

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,370
ever, ever, ever. Never.

7
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:25,240
This is Lou Garcia originally retired
from the New York city fire department as

8
00:00:25,241 --> 00:00:26,260
the chief fire Marshall,

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:32,740
so I've spent 25 years of my life looking
at fires and investigating the causes

10
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:35,950
of fire. How many fires do
you think you've seen? Oh,

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,710
tens of thousands of fires.
You've seen 10 years of

12
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:42,490
[inaudible] yourself. Yeah.

13
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,100
When he tells me his story
there was this a true story?

14
00:00:45,101 --> 00:00:46,690
I'm not going to get too
many details about it,

15
00:00:46,691 --> 00:00:49,750
but there was a fire in an area of
New York City who was in an apartment

16
00:00:49,751 --> 00:00:52,750
building in the south Bronx. As
I pulled up to this building,

17
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:55,530
the fire was already over with Lou Gatto.

18
00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:00,160
There were people in the street and we're
questioning people. People are saying,

19
00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:03,580
well, in the apartment where the
fire was, it was this brave guy.

20
00:01:03,581 --> 00:01:06,700
Somehow he'd gotten in there and
he was pouring water on fire,

21
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:10,550
trying to get the fire out. This guy
was really something and he's, and he's,

22
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,530
he's a hero right now. Everybody's
telling me what a hero he is. Everything.

23
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:18,580
The thing that we're saying in the
street about this man was wrong.

24
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,163
[inaudible]

25
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,710
so he walks into the apartment,

26
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,850
he looks around and he knows right away
where the fire started. Now how, why,

27
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:28,770
how, well, you just
look at the fire pattern

28
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,930
and could tell that the fire started first
of all in the bedroom with a mattress

29
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:40,750
mattress. The mattress now matches go
up. If you put a match to it. Really?

30
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,210
I mean, don't you have to put like
gasoline on the mattress? No, no, no.

31
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,380
Let me just put a match onto a match
mattress and it will catch fire. Yes.

32
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,770
If you hold that one off. Yeah.

33
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,750
And he also knew that the mattress had
been placed upright against the wall.

34
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,910
You could tell by the fire pattern
that was standing on it. Wow.

35
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:57,450
He can even know what position
the mattress was in. Yes,
absolutely. Believe me.

36
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:01,850
So he meets the woman whose apartment
this is, she shows up and he says this,

37
00:02:01,851 --> 00:02:04,740
so do you know this fellow who was
putting out the fire? She was, yes.

38
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:08,430
As a matter of fact, I do. Just so
happens that you used to live with me,

39
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,990
but I kicked him out. He
still had a key by the way,

40
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,840
and she knows, says I
have a new boyfriend,

41
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,360
so Garcia naturally
goes and finds the hero,

42
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,370
so now I'm questioning this fall. I said,
by the way, did you buy that mattress?

43
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:28,200
And he said, yes I did.

44
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,500
And you weren't sleeping anymore with
someone else who'd been on the mattress in

45
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:35,160
your place? And he says, yeah, we
should have the boyfriend. I said, boy,

46
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,810
I'd be pissed. How much did the question?

47
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,620
Like four or $500 you said no more
than that. It was like 800 off. I said,

48
00:02:40,621 --> 00:02:44,880
so now she is screwing somebody
else on the mattress you bought.

49
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:50,400
I would be pissed. I said, you know,
if it was me, if I were in your place,

50
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,180
I would want this mattress in the
barn. I was probably standard on end.

51
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:59,410
I would take matches, matches, and I
would put it to the, to the mattress.

52
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,200
That's what I would do. And in fact,

53
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,770
I'm an expert on fires and I know that's
what you did. You really did do that.

54
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,850
Yeah, you can talk about
it. I don't blame you.

55
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:11,500
I mean at least you tried to put it out,

56
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,130
but they'll work in your favor and
court and he looks at me. He says, well,

57
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:19,570
you're not so smart. I said,
wine. He goes, I used the lighter

58
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,613
[inaudible].

59
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,000
Oh, you're right about that.

60
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,920
Okay, so that was an easy one. We're
going to have some harder ones coming up.

61
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:38,160
Yup. Point is the whole hour. We're
going to be addressing the same problem.

62
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,420
We'll walk into one situation after
another and discover that something is not

63
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,830
right here. That's right. It's something's
not right with my son. What do I do?

64
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,710
Something's not right with
my pancreas. What do I do?

65
00:03:49,711 --> 00:03:52,410
Something's not right with the very
phrase something is not right because it

66
00:03:52,411 --> 00:03:55,830
presumes that I know what's right and
maybe I don't have we confused you enough?

67
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,840
Well, there's a whole lot of abnormal
things coming your way. This is Radiolab.

68
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,960
I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm
Robert Quilt. Stay with us.

69
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,493
Okay.

70
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,940
Okay. So this first story is about, uh,

71
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:15,110
delivering a diagnosis comes to us
from producer Louisville, Kelsey.

72
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,450
It's about two doctors who start with
that phrase, something's not right here,

73
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:23,960
and ended up going on a crazy adventure
after a cure for a deadly disease,

74
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:27,500
which is that pancreatic
cancer. Oh, that's not good.

75
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,490
It is like the most deadly cancer.

76
00:04:29,491 --> 00:04:34,050
This is the one that people
have nightmares about.
Why you mean it's deadly?

77
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,310
How like, well, it's, it's rare, but
it's deadly. It's the one where you know,

78
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:41,160
you, something's wrong. You
go to the doctor and they say,

79
00:04:41,161 --> 00:04:45,600
you have six months to live. Wow. Is
it that fast? It usually is that fast.

80
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:51,120
How'd you find this out? I found this
out because my friend Amy, um, said,

81
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,520
I've got a friend named Dr.
Terry Brenton [inaudible].

82
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,510
She made a big scientific
discovery and yeah,

83
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:59,120
you should go to her press conference.
This will be amazing. Like,

84
00:04:59,121 --> 00:05:01,130
go and I go to the press, male friends.

85
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,530
It's just a tremendous
pleasure to be here today.

86
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:08,920
Press conferences are kind
of never amazing and I hope
to one unfold a story for

87
00:05:09,081 --> 00:05:11,090
you. I hope it will
capture your attention.

88
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:16,070
It's a fascinating story and I heard
this incredible story about 10 years ago.

89
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:20,660
One morning, a 40 year old
guy came into my clinic,

90
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:24,530
Mr x just finishing mine,
very healthy looking,

91
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,540
and he comes into my clinic and he says,

92
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,370
I'm worried I'm going to
get pancreatic cancer,

93
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,270
that I'm going to get the curse in
my family. It was like, good gooby,

94
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,110
what are you talking about? And
he said, well, in my family,

95
00:05:39,111 --> 00:05:41,060
my father got pancreatic cancer,

96
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:45,830
my grandfather and my foreign
uncles and my three cousins. Wow.

97
00:05:45,831 --> 00:05:50,300
Four uncles, three cousins, father,
grandfather, all die of pancreatic cancer.

98
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,310
And this guy was sure he was next in line,

99
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:56,000
his uncles and his father looked like
the healthiest people in the world.

100
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,670
Six months later they're
dead. He was terrified.

101
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,090
He came to me is a act of desperation.

102
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:08,210
I mean, it's not a feeling, I guess
they're not. Maybe I know or you know.

103
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,370
But what happened when you
walked in as like Terry,

104
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,270
she knew exactly how he felt.
You can't even process anything.

105
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,510
You're just like almost in a trance.

106
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:21,170
She'd gone through that before
completely and utterly alone.

107
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,280
She was diagnosed with breast cancer
when she was 34 it's a sense of falling.

108
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,610
It's truly a sense of falling.
The world slides away from you.

109
00:06:31,611 --> 00:06:35,720
You literally, it's almost like
it disappears from underneath you.

110
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,350
When she got the news, the first thing
her doctor did, he was a friend of hers,

111
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,630
pulled out the whiskey
and put it on the table.

112
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,250
She had a shot, which was like,
thank God he did that. [inaudible]

113
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,890
he said, I'm not gonna [inaudible].

114
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,250
We're going to fight this
thing. You are not alone.

115
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,230
That's all I needed to hear.

116
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:00,300
And so when she was sitting
there with with patient x,

117
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:03,220
she knew exactly what to say.
You have to step forward.

118
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,700
You can't step back and just [inaudible]

119
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,070
[inaudible]

120
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:12,280
I was young then and so I felt, look,

121
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,810
I fixed this thing. I'll
take that on. I can help you.

122
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,540
I don't care how horrible
it's what happens next.

123
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:23,650
So Terry runs back to her office and
office. She shares with another doctor,

124
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:28,480
Mary Bronner, Mary Brunner, I'm a
pathologist. So I was like, Mary,

125
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:31,300
Mary says you won't believe
this, this guy, Mr x,

126
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,590
walk into my office and he has this
outrageous, his crazy family histories.

127
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:38,260
Horrible problem was floored.

128
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,520
Terry had never heard that pancreatic
cancer could be inherited and families,

129
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,280
they'd never heard of anything like
that. Terry comes in and she's like,

130
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:49,180
I've got to help this guy.
I have to figure out what's
making these people sick.

131
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:53,050
And Mary, I need your help. And,
and Mary, what did she say? Well,

132
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:57,550
she's a pathologist. So, and what does
it mean to be a pathologist? Well, she's,

133
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:00,670
she's the person who
physically does the diagnosis.

134
00:08:00,671 --> 00:08:04,720
When your surgeon does an operation on
you or your internist takes a biopsy of

135
00:08:04,721 --> 00:08:05,554
you,

136
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:10,650
they send that tissue to me and I make
it into glass slides to look at under the

137
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:18,580
microscopes. So she spends
her time looking at tiny
pieces of Terry's patients,

138
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,990
smeared on little slots.

139
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:24,940
I love the emotional distance that you
have in pathology. You're, you know,

140
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:30,690
a step removed from the misery and it
makes it so much easier for me to handle

141
00:08:32,201 --> 00:08:34,780
it. Does she interact with
patients? Almost never.

142
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,460
Terry was right up against in misery and
she was just relaying the story to me.

143
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:44,320
But I can sit very comfortably at my
microscope and be very objective and just

144
00:08:44,321 --> 00:08:48,340
look at the tissue and decide where the
cancer is because I don't know these

145
00:08:48,341 --> 00:08:51,220
patients. So you're
like, I gotta go do this.

146
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,620
Come with me as she usually
does. How did you decide that

147
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:00,360
Mary should join you? She's
my science partner. That's it.

148
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,180
And I have to in the cat, I usually,

149
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,520
so they decided in order to help this guy,

150
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,560
they need to go to where his family is.

151
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:13,360
He drove across the mountains
of Washington state.

152
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:20,040
[inaudible] track. They went, wanted to
get the family together. Three exactly.

153
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:21,700
Nicknames, draw their blood,

154
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,360
look at their blood to see if there's
something in there that's making all these

155
00:09:25,361 --> 00:09:27,060
people sick. And

156
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,760
we arrive at the little tiny
town in eastern Washington,

157
00:09:30,761 --> 00:09:33,540
a little town called Elma. And then
they didn't even have, they're so small,

158
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:38,340
they don't have a single medical facility.
So in order to do the blood draw,

159
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:43,460
we basically had to use the
subway sandwich shop in town.

160
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:46,140
Why? Why subway would
have great sandwiches.

161
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:50,300
One of the family members worked
there and asked the boss if,

162
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:54,030
if the family could all come and these
doctors could come and draw their blood

163
00:09:54,031 --> 00:09:57,030
and could we use the
shop as the meeting place

164
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,720
walking in and thinking this is small.

165
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:07,070
So we've set up a little corner booth
with our box of blood drawing supplies and

166
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:12,480
they sort of came in waves,
uncles, cousins, nieces,

167
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,900
nephews and they brought their kids
filled that subway sandwich shop.

168
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,680
How many in all?

169
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,240
About 30 it was funny cause they
hadn't seen each other or like,

170
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,690
oh my God, see you in 10 years.

171
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,250
It's like wow, you guys only
live like five miles up there.

172
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:31,820
We'd bring them over to our little tiny
booth and we'd introduce ourselves.

173
00:10:31,821 --> 00:10:36,380
I'm Carrie Brenton or Mary Brian or
GI doctor. I am a surgical oncologist.

174
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:41,360
The purpose of our work today is that we
are trying to find the cancer gene that

175
00:10:41,361 --> 00:10:43,010
causes the disease in your family.

176
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,720
With your permission today, we'd
like to take a small blood sample.

177
00:10:47,721 --> 00:10:49,790
It's about the size of two tablespoons.

178
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,550
You will not get any results
back from this blood test.

179
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:56,810
I want to be really clear about that.
It's all for us to try and find the gene.

180
00:10:56,811 --> 00:11:00,050
I can't even promise that.
We'll definitely find that gene.

181
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,070
Here is your sandwich and
now me have some blood.

182
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,990
As we were waiting for most
of the family to show up,

183
00:11:09,991 --> 00:11:13,980
Terry and I were sitting in this one booth
with one of the family members who we

184
00:11:13,981 --> 00:11:17,910
had already identified as having
the disease. He was young,

185
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:22,911
he was in his thirties and all I could
think was you have a time bomb inside

186
00:11:27,361 --> 00:11:28,194
your body.

187
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:33,780
[inaudible]

188
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:37,320
and then this little boy comes
running into the subway sandwich shop,

189
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:41,430
just like friends up to this
guy that we're talking to,

190
00:11:41,431 --> 00:11:43,640
this patient to family ex. Well, his,

191
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:47,460
his arms around his daddy's
neck and kisses him and, and,

192
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:51,420
and all I could think was, oh my
God, this beautiful little child,

193
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,320
he has 50% chance of having
this hideous disease.

194
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,190
And I was so upset about that.

195
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:05,020
I was just so torn apart inside,
but I couldn't really, you know,

196
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:06,930
start over

197
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:10,440
bawling right there. Rest your head.
That wouldn't have been professional.

198
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:13,640
I held it together until
we were driving home and,

199
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:18,410
and I was telling Terry how sad I was
about that little boy and how it just

200
00:12:18,411 --> 00:12:21,770
really hit me. And she said, oh,

201
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,270
hello. Don't worry
about him. He's adopted.

202
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:33,870
You have to remember, Mary doesn't come
face to face with patients very often.

203
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:38,250
It's not something a pathologist
does very frequently.

204
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:39,923
Pathologists have the,

205
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,720
I don't even know if I want to tell
you this is sort of like [inaudible]

206
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,600
the black side of pathology,

207
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:52,030
black humor to get you
through or whatever. Yeah.
Really black humor, you know,

208
00:12:52,031 --> 00:12:53,890
we'll see things like, um,

209
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:58,390
somebody better tell this patient not
to buy the big tube of toothpaste.

210
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,890
Terry's laughing,

211
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:07,060
but that's why we do it
because it's so horrible.

212
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,450
I spent an afternoon with
Mary going through slides,

213
00:13:10,451 --> 00:13:15,070
looking at pancreatic tissue, three
trying to figure out like, you know,

214
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:18,700
if this person has cancer
or not. Dozens of patients.

215
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:22,300
Now this is another case with
it. Terrible, terrible case.

216
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:25,840
And that's when I really kind of
got it. Like why she'd want to

217
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:32,470
keep herself distant. Oh, this cancer
is even worse than the last one.

218
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,573
This person,

219
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:39,530
if they can go to a beautiful place
on planet earth and just stay there

220
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:48,460
till it's over, we would have
enough to subway though. I mean,

221
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:51,520
were they able to, you know, figure
out what's causing this thing? Well,

222
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:56,020
once they got the blood, they worked
on it for about five years, five years.

223
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,850
You know, they went
chromosome by chromosome,

224
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:02,290
collaborated with all these other
researchers and at the end of the day they

225
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:06,580
discovered that the thing that causes
familial pancreatic cancer comes down to a

226
00:14:06,581 --> 00:14:10,630
mistake. One little mistake on one,

227
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,400
one molecule molecule. I know it
comes down to one tiny molecule. Yes.

228
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,640
So our discovery is, uh,

229
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:22,730
we're titling it Paladin mutation causes
familial pancreatic cancer and suggests

230
00:14:23,381 --> 00:14:25,770
a new cancer mechanism.
So they write a paper,

231
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:28,900
I have a press conference of all I
want to acknowledge and they celebrate.

232
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:36,600
So in the end, do they, do they
find a cure? Well, no, not yet.

233
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:42,030
They're working on, can they at least,
um, test for it now? Well, they can test,

234
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,210
but you know,

235
00:14:45,211 --> 00:14:48,180
most pancreatic cancer
isn't hereditary like this.

236
00:14:48,181 --> 00:14:50,850
This is actually a small subset.

237
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:53,303
Do Girl.

238
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,980
So where does that leave Mary and
Terry? I mean, where are they now?

239
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:00,800
Mary's really, yeah,

240
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,600
glad the research phase

241
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,910
is over and that she doesn't have
to be with patients anymore. Terri

242
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,320
nodes, they have more work to do
and they can't really give up,

243
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,800
but she's really tired and
thinks about it a lot. You know,

244
00:15:18,801 --> 00:15:22,520
the stakes are so high in this eye.
Sometimes it's almost unbearable.

245
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:26,620
Sometimes I think I should
quit. Really? Yeah, totally.

246
00:15:26,621 --> 00:15:29,520
I've talked to Mary about it,
but you know what? I know she'll,

247
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:32,390
I never stopped doing it. Right. Terry

248
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:36,530
[inaudible]

249
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,090
sometimes it's just too much

250
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:40,900
too.

251
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,640
Mary and I love to garden.
So sometimes you know,

252
00:15:44,641 --> 00:15:47,340
we think about being
landscape architects. Yeah.

253
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,720
And then the worst thing that does is,
oh, I killed the bush. They were like,

254
00:15:51,721 --> 00:15:53,370
you lose, you killed the bush.

255
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:12,990
[inaudible] [inaudible]

256
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,940
thanks to the little Kelsey
for reporting that story.

257
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,700
The next story concerns
a dad and his little boy.

258
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,580
There's something about this
little boy that is not quite right,

259
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:24,670
but there's something about the
dad that doesn't want to say. So

260
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,210
that's coming up in about a minute.

261
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:30,290
I'm Jabu Rod and I'm Robert
Krulwich Radiolab. We'll continue.

262
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:35,600
Radio lab is funded in part by
the Alfred p Sloan Foundation,

263
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:40,310
the corporation for public broadcasting
and the National Science Foundation.

264
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,040
Hey, I'm Jana. Boom Ryan.
I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab.

265
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:53,030
This hour our topic is diagnosis.
This next story begins with a dad,

266
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:58,010
two sons and a question. What do you
do when you notice somebody different?

267
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,930
I heard it from reporter Gregory, right?

268
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:03,410
Hello. Hi Gregory. Found it very
rewarding. It's nice to meet.

269
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,110
Nice to meet you in case. Just so
you know, it took me over a year.

270
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:09,480
You can sit down and you've to finally
get an interview with Byron France.

271
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,150
I'm wondering if the air,

272
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:15,740
I can turn the dead in their storage
yard and I'm up in his apartment in the

273
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:19,910
South Bronx. You'll have to skills all
of this loose paperwork. Are you just,

274
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:23,240
are you moving out or are you
moving? It looks like look like that.

275
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,050
Was that messy. I don't
want boxes everywhere.

276
00:17:27,051 --> 00:17:31,910
Crazy piles of stuff. Okay, let
go. Don't worry about a sure.

277
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,530
Yeah. Sorry. Already seen it up. It's
in disarray. So who is this guy? I A,

278
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:40,880
I am a retired electrical engineer. He
worked for subway most of his life now.

279
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,250
Uh, I consider myself a science
researcher and it's 71 years old.

280
00:17:46,251 --> 00:17:48,590
He's basically teaching
himself onto physics.

281
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:52,740
That's what all the books and stuff
you see around. I love that stuff.

282
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:57,800
And he's written this
book called Einstein's era
criticizing special relativity.

283
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:03,210
Einstein. I sent it to the New York
Academy of Science at Caltech, MIT,

284
00:18:03,211 --> 00:18:05,970
Harvard, even Hawkins. Still
waiting for him to get back.

285
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,060
Most people just ignore him.
These are the rabies off maniac.

286
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,990
But then he points to his letter on the
wall. Yeah. From Neil degrasse Tyson.

287
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,420
They know that name, this
major scientist? Yes.

288
00:18:15,421 --> 00:18:19,930
Ahead of the Hayden Planetarium in
Manhattan. Exactly. Yeah. And it says how

289
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,010
there you, you're just an engineer. Yeah.

290
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:24,530
Ah,

291
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:27,830
and he's BV. Why, why
do you smile when, when,

292
00:18:27,831 --> 00:18:31,370
when you talk about that letter from
Neil degrasse Tyson because they know how

293
00:18:31,371 --> 00:18:34,900
foolish it is. Einstein,

294
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,370
they didn't even want to read his paper.
He said, who is this guy up? Scott.

295
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,250
He just a patent
examination clerk. And Bern.

296
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,690
Byron founders is a man who's
proud to go against the grain.

297
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:49,960
The what other people
do. I don't really do.

298
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:55,400
And that's especially true with how he
raised his son. So now, uh, Gregory,

299
00:18:55,510 --> 00:19:00,060
you're going to do, uh, some kind of a
story on he manuals. Youngest son, right?

300
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:01,250
Emmanuel. Okay.

301
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:05,060
And that's why I'm here focusing on two
to question him about how he raised his

302
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:08,030
son. Alright, that'd be glad to.
Okay, great. So here's the manual.

303
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:11,650
Hi, I'm Emmanuel [inaudible]. A man,
could you take a drink of water for me?

304
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:16,290
Just okay, thank you.
No, don't take me. Yeah,

305
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,560
take as many drinks of water if you want.

306
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,570
He's 28 so what things are
you good at? Manual, um,

307
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:26,750
writing essays and making sure
they aren't grammatically correct.

308
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,640
[inaudible] bowling and so
you can hear analyzing stuff.

309
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:36,120
There is something going
on with them. Um, and,

310
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,940
and, and not talking that much.

311
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,310
Yes. No. If you ask dad,

312
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:48,040
he'll say, Emmanuel's an
excellent student. Our Future,

313
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,430
no balance is going to win a
Nobel prize. You never know. But

314
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:55,580
if you ask Blair, I'm Blair frown or
who's that Emmanuel's half-brother.

315
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,710
I'm about 20 years old. And then Emmanuel,

316
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:01,280
he'll tell you that even as a little
kid, very little, five years old,

317
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:04,310
there was something odd and I
just didn't know what it was.

318
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,420
It's a bunch of little things.

319
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:09,510
Yeah. Like he'd look at you really weird,
kind of like a Dow face expression.

320
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:14,930
He could stare at me without blinking
for 15 minutes at a time and I would

321
00:20:15,661 --> 00:20:19,740
notice, cause you didn't blink
once then there was a speech.

322
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,280
I did not talk as much as other people.

323
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:27,000
There was something going on with the
manual, but I did not have a word for it.

324
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,450
And so I'm

325
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,760
pushed several times
to get speech therapy,

326
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:34,870
but every time he did, dad
would just say, are you kidding?

327
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:38,920
He may have troubled stumbling and
stammering, but he'll grow out of it.

328
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,910
I started to layer, you
also started Einstein.

329
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,440
He didn't speak a word until he was
six. He was considered retarded school.

330
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:51,940
He would say that this was some, a
temporary problem that would pass.

331
00:20:51,941 --> 00:20:56,590
I didn't see anything that was, that
was screaming out for attention.

332
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:00,070
He was doing his work. He
was interested in the next,

333
00:21:00,071 --> 00:21:05,071
we would go out endlessly in cold weather
to the park and it seemed like things

334
00:21:05,381 --> 00:21:07,510
were okay. What about Emmanuel?

335
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:08,700
Well,

336
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:13,160
I knew then I was a nicer
person and nicer person.

337
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,213
Yay.

338
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:19,410
And then I was sent [inaudible].

339
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:23,900
I don't automatically look
at people in the eyes,

340
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,760
the face and stuff, you know?

341
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:32,570
So as long as Emmanuel was a little
kid, it wasn't such a big deal.

342
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,090
But then he got older,

343
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:39,230
he was around 10 years old and it was,
I think at the point where I'm on,

344
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:43,010
the people would point it
out. What did they say? Well,

345
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,810
I have been called, um,

346
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,180
returning an idiot savant,
the n word and stuff.

347
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:54,230
They lost the innocence
of the elementary school.

348
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:58,190
Emmanuel would come home with bruises
on his arms. Yeah. Yeah. It was,

349
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:01,460
it was something that I constantly
thought about and worried about.

350
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,261
I said, yeah,

351
00:22:02,261 --> 00:22:05,350
well it'd be really good for him
to get professional help with that.

352
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:08,720
Did you ask dad? He said the
problem wasn't a manual. No,

353
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:13,130
it was all the other people.
The bully. See, uh, the group

354
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,990
in this neighborhood, it was hot.

355
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:20,720
There was fighting constant fighting
right down the street over here.

356
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:25,110
People involved with crack.
These are big guys. You know,

357
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:30,120
I felt that it could have been a
dangerous situation. So his solution,

358
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:35,150
I decided that I wanted to teach you
manual homeschool was just to pull his son

359
00:22:35,371 --> 00:22:36,204
out of school.

360
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,490
Yeah. And how do you feel about
this at the time? Well, I,

361
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,920
I really didn't know.

362
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,070
Oh, up here. So we're
looking in the closet here.

363
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,190
I thought that whatever way
he is kind of turned in.

364
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:52,630
This is a binder from one of his classes
that if he got bullied and tormented

365
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:55,740
and going to school, that it
would turn him further in. Oh,

366
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,390
let's see what this did. If he were here,

367
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:03,040
he could develop along his own line
until he became old enough that they

368
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:07,770
wouldn't want to pick on him. Oh,
look what we turned to nature.

369
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,810
Nurture. It was a big deal for dad.

370
00:23:10,811 --> 00:23:14,800
You hadn't homeschooled
anybody else before, right? No.

371
00:23:14,801 --> 00:23:18,460
I had to get books. I had to go
meet the principal. He left his job,

372
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:23,740
submitted a curriculum to the school and
I had to register with the state of New

373
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,170
York, created this syllabus
for his son, great.

374
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:31,300
10 integrated math courses and they would
wake up each morning rational numbers,

375
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,890
geometry, do their lessons. He's trying
to leak lateral, trying have some lunch.

376
00:23:35,891 --> 00:23:39,850
This is the work that he did at home
and in the afternoon they'd go bowling.

377
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,073
Bowling.

378
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:46,030
The manual was an
awesome book. [inaudible]

379
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,360
his dad would videotape them.

380
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,820
Today is Tuesday, December

381
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,730
28 1993. It's weird footage.

382
00:23:56,731 --> 00:23:59,690
It's weird to watch because the manual
is such an incredibly good boulder.

383
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,270
Yeah, he took it out but beautiful
shot. He's always by himself.

384
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:13,850
Tape after tape of nothing but a
manual. Nobody else in the picture

385
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:19,600
I would fan to size about throwing an
into and winning some times and stuff.

386
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:27,360
Did you think about
joining any youth league?

387
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,753
Well,

388
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:35,120
well I vaguely dawn about it but um,

389
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:39,020
but for some reason my dad um,

390
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:40,850
did not want me to

391
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:48,323
[inaudible].

392
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:52,810
Meanwhile his brother is just players
in Canada at a distance. Yeah.

393
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:57,040
He followed a girl there and one
day he picks a book off the shelf,

394
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:02,280
the DSM and the DSM is the a
diagdiagnosis statistical manual of mental

395
00:25:03,161 --> 00:25:06,430
disorders and I started just to do,

396
00:25:06,431 --> 00:25:09,980
I guess what a lot of people would do
who could get a hold of this thing is to

397
00:25:09,981 --> 00:25:11,980
start diagnosing all of their friends.

398
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:17,570
I diagnosed my girlfriend and I diagnosed
my dad and then I saw her right there

399
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,333
on the page.

400
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:24,630
Marc's impairment in the use of multiple
nonverbal behaviors such as eye to eye

401
00:25:24,631 --> 00:25:29,380
gaze, repetitive behavior patterns,
problem seeking, new friends, problem,

402
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,370
being able to understand what someone
must be thinking. Problems. Okay.

403
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:38,660
Went down this whole list and everything
seemed to fit Martin Pyramids and I,

404
00:25:39,231 --> 00:25:42,120
I gave this promise every
time he tried to call his dad.

405
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,560
What do you think his dad would
say? Just stop whining. Let go.

406
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:47,490
He'll just go through
this and he shot him out.

407
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:51,030
Or you basically cut
communication? I know my son,

408
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,110
he would always tell me.

409
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,760
Then whenever I hand would
go way when I was in adult.

410
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,320
What does an adult mean?

411
00:26:01,321 --> 00:26:06,321
Does that mean 1820 maybe 20 lesson.

412
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:07,463
Okay,

413
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:12,420
so you thought as soon as I reached
the age of 20 then I won't have these

414
00:26:12,421 --> 00:26:13,560
problems. Yeah.

415
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:19,070
So did you wake up on your 20th birthday
and think I thought they made me,

416
00:26:19,231 --> 00:26:22,800
things would change right away.

417
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,713
Okay.

418
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:29,740
But they didn't, after that,
Emmanuel says he got really depressed

419
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:31,350
and

420
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:32,610
that's how things might've stayed

421
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,113
until

422
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,530
dad had a heart attack.

423
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:45,000
Blair comes to the hospital,
finds dead unconscious in the bed,

424
00:26:45,001 --> 00:26:49,290
and he realizes this is my big chance
because he was not in a position to

425
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:50,850
intervene. And you're thinking,

426
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,760
I'm thinking the first thing that's going
to happen is that we're going to get a

427
00:26:53,761 --> 00:26:56,430
diagnosis because we're waiting
for it for so many years,

428
00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:01,110
26 or older or whatever. He goes
like 25 means he's going to get help.

429
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,480
You know, he's, he has
to go, here's the, okay,

430
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:09,520
2005 so where are we coming into now
we're at 42nd street times square

431
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:14,760
time square is one of Emanuel's favorite
areas to hang out and I figured I

432
00:27:14,761 --> 00:27:18,390
wanted to be on his
surf so they're outside.

433
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,370
The crowd is just beginning to arrive.

434
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:24,360
It was starting to snow a little
bit and rain some too. Yeah.

435
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:29,570
Blair turns to me and he says, oh,
have you ever heard of [inaudible]

436
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,330
[inaudible]

437
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:38,140
autism? I said,

438
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,480
I highly suspect that you have some form
of autism and I want us to find some

439
00:27:45,641 --> 00:27:47,190
way for you to get a diagnosis.

440
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:52,510
[inaudible]

441
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:55,870
oh, and I said six. Don't read
the word of this to death.

442
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,010
[inaudible] [inaudible]

443
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:07,530
Dr. How do I pronounce your
name? FDIC. Yeah. And agnostic.

444
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,620
And pretty soon after new years,
oh, and where are you from?

445
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:14,340
Manual gets his diagnosis. He
goes right here on this couch.

446
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,230
I did get a feeling from my beginning of
the direction that he was going to meet

447
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:23,250
criteria for autism. And a month
later she told me did. I was on the

448
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,060
autistic spectrum. It was official,

449
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:33,830
um, k football, even Maria, uh,

450
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:35,050
good.

451
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:39,930
And so at the age of 26, finally Maria,

452
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,370
he, his life completely changed.

453
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:47,510
So I gave him a tape recorder to
record his life. Hello with me venue.

454
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:52,000
He's meeting with the speech pathologist
a couple of hours a week also.

455
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:56,770
He's joined this program. I know tastings.
Started making friends. Oh, do I say

456
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:03,400
hello? Hey Jason. Peace
out. Got a girlfriend.

457
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,850
Hey, it's me, Emmanuel once again.

458
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:11,510
And there's one lady that I
haven't talked about your name,

459
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,673
Norma.

460
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:18,830
And we went to central park and
we took pitches and it was great.

461
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:19,841
But I want you to say,

462
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:23,140
I thought that people who are
diagnosed with autism don't this,

463
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:25,660
the definition is they
don't want to socialize.

464
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:30,990
Well ms not because I don't do want
to buy [inaudible] this is hard to do.

465
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,700
He know. But here's the thing about a
manual. He's had this whole new life.

466
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:42,240
He hasn't told dad about any
of it. Hello? Anything. Not

467
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,270
the girl, the friends, the diagnosis.

468
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,640
His Dad doesn't know anything's different.

469
00:29:47,641 --> 00:29:49,410
So how long have you
been keeping it a secret?

470
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:53,550
Uh, it's been since 2005. Right? Yeah.

471
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:57,130
So basically for the last two years I
manual has been leading this double life

472
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:01,960
outside. He's a person with autism,
then he comes home. Nothing's wrong.

473
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,630
Why [inaudible]

474
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:08,870
well, um, just the
fainting, the, anyone, um,

475
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:11,390
really, um, believe in,

476
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,190
but he knows he's got to tell
his dad who he really is.

477
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:17,740
Do and he keeps saying he will. Yeah,

478
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,600
I'm say within a month
soon. I'm not quite sure.

479
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,680
We can, I am a little bit
nervous about telling him

480
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:33,100
maybe within a few minutes, assuming,
let me tell him in like two weeks or so.

481
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,450
Another day, a mind telling method.

482
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:40,510
I mean Blair [inaudible] well
tomorrow maybe one or no.

483
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:44,750
Yeah, maybe I'm just thinking about it a
little bit too much. I don't know. Men.

484
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:47,860
Finally one night I

485
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:55,080
just want to saying that I told
him and about my diagnosis,

486
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:55,931
um,

487
00:30:55,931 --> 00:31:00,931
I said I really have something
important to say and don't get angry.

488
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:06,961
And then I told him that I was diagnosed
with Asperger's syndrome and he asked

489
00:31:08,921 --> 00:31:13,600
me what it was and then I told
them it is high functioning autism.

490
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,470
Uh, I was shocked.

491
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,650
That would, that would
be a good way to put it.

492
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:24,620
So do you think he has Asperger's? Yes.

493
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:27,900
Yes I do.

494
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:28,840
Okay.

495
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:33,840
When I look at this syndrome
for a lot of good parts of it,

496
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:34,900
it's e manual,

497
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:41,070
but I never at any point felt that
that Emmanuel was in need of any deep

498
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:45,310
psychological or psych psychiatric help.

499
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,553
But

500
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:50,300
you mean what makes you
qualified to say that?

501
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:54,680
Just being a loving parent
as I'm talking to him.

502
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,610
We're sitting there on the couch
in front of us on the coffee table,

503
00:31:58,611 --> 00:32:03,000
is all of the manuals, notebooks
from age five onwards and they're,

504
00:32:03,001 --> 00:32:04,720
they're really good stuff. I mean it's,

505
00:32:04,721 --> 00:32:07,250
it's stuff that you and I would
write and he saved it all.

506
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:11,840
But the question that I feel like I
gotta ask her and I just have one more

507
00:32:11,841 --> 00:32:15,150
question on my list if I
can ask you that one is, um,

508
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,930
now that you know that there is
something wrong with your son,

509
00:32:17,931 --> 00:32:21,380
that there always was this
disorder, that it's incurable.

510
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,940
Do you think you did
the right thing? So d,

511
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:27,800
do you wish that he had gotten
the diagnosis earlier? No,

512
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:33,440
because I think that he's better
off at this point in time.

513
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:38,750
Why wouldn't it make a difference to
know earlier what's why you're acting.

514
00:32:38,751 --> 00:32:40,040
So I

515
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:45,040
didn't want you manual to get a
diagnosis that would put him in a box,

516
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:49,970
like a label. And then dad
says to me, remember, look,

517
00:32:49,971 --> 00:32:53,720
I mean if I let the school give
him some kind of diagnosis,

518
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:57,020
they would have thrown him in special
ed and say, oh, he's a retard. Look,

519
00:32:57,021 --> 00:32:59,540
he can't even talk. I mean, that
would have destroyed them. Do what?

520
00:32:59,541 --> 00:33:03,500
Cause irreparable damage.
I asked the doctor,

521
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:06,500
was there any truth to that? If
a manual was put into special Ed,

522
00:33:06,501 --> 00:33:09,090
hypothetically, he wasn't a
district's. If the five class,

523
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:12,710
the technical word for special ed would
not have raised his academic potential.

524
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:18,080
He, he said graduate from Saint
John's with a degree in psychology.

525
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:22,910
Kids who graduated district 75 don't do
that. Just to put that in perspective,

526
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:28,150
Emmanuel comes from a neighborhood where
about 10% of the kids ever graduate

527
00:33:28,151 --> 00:33:32,570
college, and my GPA was
like 3.4 and change.

528
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,590
Wow. And he's got Asperger's. So
now we're kind of in the opposite.

529
00:33:36,591 --> 00:33:40,310
We're kind of vindicating really
what his father did. Right. Well,

530
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:44,180
in terms of his academic achievement,
his father did the right thing.

531
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,160
The problem with his dad's choice and
he had no way of knowing at the time was

532
00:33:49,161 --> 00:33:52,160
the lack of peer groups
with teammates down.

533
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:55,520
It seems like a cruel
choice, but with choice.

534
00:33:55,970 --> 00:34:00,590
So if you were your father and you
were raising your kid at that time,

535
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,240
would you have made
the same choice he did?

536
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,950
Uh, well con, well,

537
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:11,120
if I had known what I known now,

538
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:17,670
then maybe I would have maybe
back to him a little more for me.

539
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:23,590
You get to interact with
others who were like, I am,

540
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:25,000
who are like, I am

541
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:38,923
[inaudible] [inaudible]

542
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:43,910
that story from our correspondent
Gregory Warner creeks are pointing,

543
00:34:43,911 --> 00:34:47,900
was made possible in part by the Roslyn

545

Thanks to them and thank you to Lulu
Miller for producing that piece.

00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:53,700
We will continue in a month.

547
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:57,050
This is Bonnie calling

552
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:20,670
hello, I'm Jad Boom Ron and
I'm Robert Krulwich. Radiolab.

553
00:35:20,671 --> 00:35:24,990
This hour we're going to talking about
diagnosis, diagnosis, the easy kind.

554
00:35:24,991 --> 00:35:25,920
We're not going to talk about it.

555
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:29,250
Easy would be you come into my office
and I'm a doctor. You have a broken arm.

556
00:35:29,251 --> 00:35:32,940
I take a picture. I say, Hey, you've
got a broken arm. The picture says so.

557
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,380
Yeah. Cause you can see
the break right there.

558
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:38,520
But let's suppose you came
into my office and you sad.

559
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:43,400
You tell me that your sex drive is down.
Yay. I'm the doctors who are gonna sit.

560
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:45,060
But just between you
and me. All right. Well,

561
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:49,440
right away my learning tells me that
you may be a candidate for depression,

562
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:52,690
but how do I know that you're
depressed? What do you mean?

563
00:35:52,691 --> 00:35:55,030
How do we know we talk
about it? You just said,

564
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:58,660
well you can't measure
sadness or depression.

565
00:35:58,661 --> 00:36:02,470
You can't go to a test tube
and count anything. Right.

566
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:07,240
It's not hard science.
Yeah, because till now,

567
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:10,390
what if I put you in, you know,

568
00:36:10,391 --> 00:36:13,150
one of those FMR try machines that
we've talked about so often? Yeah.

569
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:18,270
I snap a picture of your brain in action
and I look at it and from your picture

570
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:22,450
I say that you are depressed. You're
going to tell me I'm depressed.

571
00:36:22,451 --> 00:36:26,650
Just from looking at a picture
of my brain. Yes, no way. Look,

572
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:31,960
it's now here. Photographic diagnosis
of mental illness is happening.

573
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:36,100
There is no question and that by the
way is Eric Candela professor up at

574
00:36:36,101 --> 00:36:41,101
Columbia University who just happens to
have won the Nobel prize for medicine.

575
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,480
Let me give you a little historical
background. Did you get a note? Oh,

576
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,960
I don't think you did. I
still don't believe you.

577
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,660
And what just cause he's got a Nobel
prize. I'm going to suddenly turn it on.

578
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:53,140
You're not. So let's do this
step by step. Okay. Step one.

579
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:57,400
Imagine you're slipping
into an FMRI machine. Okay.

580
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:02,380
Right now I want you to just look at
my face. Why is that so difficult?

581
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,240
I just wanna where this is
going anywhere here. Okay.

582
00:37:04,241 --> 00:37:07,150
I'm looking at your face now
that you're looking at my face,

583
00:37:07,151 --> 00:37:09,400
different regions of the
brain, they become active.

584
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:15,340
There are cells in your brain
that are saying, I know him.

585
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:18,390
The cells are more active. They
need energy. Just like when you run,

586
00:37:18,391 --> 00:37:21,820
you have to breathe fast and to get the
energy, your heart pumps more blood.

587
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:28,150
The body sends a rush of fresh blood
with that particular group of cells and

588
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,220
because the blood has iron in it,

589
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:35,380
the magnet and the brain scanner can
see the iron and therefore see the blood

590
00:37:35,381 --> 00:37:40,270
flow and take pictures of it. Many,

591
00:37:40,271 --> 00:37:44,470
many pictures in real time. I'll
show you a very nice example of this.

592
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:49,150
Eric's now heading off across his ample
office with an extraordinary view of the

593
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:52,180
Hudson Valley and he brought over a
picture of a human brain with different

594
00:37:52,181 --> 00:37:55,390
colors in different areas, and he
told me, when you look at a face,

595
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:58,330
when you image the face,
this area lights up.

596
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,640
You're pointing to an area of
the gray area of the brain.

597
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,270
You're on your forehead kind
of. That's right. That's right.

598
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:07,300
If you look at a house,
some other area lights up,

599
00:38:07,301 --> 00:38:10,270
but this area does not light
up. You look at another face.

600
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:13,660
This area lights up again every time
you see a face, the same area. Yup.

601
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:17,140
But you haven't told me anything
about emotions yet. That's true.

602
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,850
So let's move on to step two

603
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:24,310
because we use faces to tell what someone
else is thinking or someone else's

604
00:38:24,311 --> 00:38:24,970
feeling.

605
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:29,820
Looking at faces also triggers an area
deep in the brain that is concerned with

606
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,570
emotion called the Amygdala.

607
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:37,270
Now very recently number of people have
at the make the looking at faces and

608
00:38:37,271 --> 00:38:40,090
it's extremely interesting. Step three.

609
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:46,240
Okay, I'm going to take you now to
London. Hello. Hi. Yeah, hi. Yeah,

610
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:49,750
that's good. It's [inaudible] who's
this? Oh wait, sorry. Who are you?

611
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,750
I'm Cynthia [inaudible]. My psychiatrist
at the Institute of Psychiatry.

612
00:38:52,751 --> 00:38:53,800
King's college. London.

613
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:58,060
And Are you liking your thirties or your
forties or fifties this is part of the

614
00:38:58,061 --> 00:39:00,260
interview I want cause like,

615
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:04,960
cause I wanted to establish that she
came into psychiatry. Trying to think,

616
00:39:04,961 --> 00:39:07,990
when did I graduate medical school.
I didn't have very critical time.

617
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:13,080
I finished my training in 97 I training
psychiatry in 97 that's 1997 when the

618
00:39:13,511 --> 00:39:15,940
Fmri machines were first
becoming available.

619
00:39:15,941 --> 00:39:20,941
And so Cynthia was able to do a rather
amazing study what in this study she got

620
00:39:22,661 --> 00:39:26,050
together a group of people who were
clinically depressed, depressed people,

621
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,200
and then another group of people who are
normal healthy people and she put them

622
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:32,860
in the brain scan machine and
showed them facial expressions,

623
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:37,570
thesis ranging from more neutral
expressions to more sad expressions.

624
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,740
So they saw a sad face and then a
neutral face and then a sad face.

625
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,310
That's right.

626
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:46,660
And what the person in the machine was
supposed to do is look at these faces and

627
00:39:46,661 --> 00:39:49,180
decide whether it was a
man or a woman's face.

628
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,250
What does that have to do
with anything? Because,

629
00:39:51,251 --> 00:39:53,980
because while they were doing that,
how they're making the decision,

630
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:57,910
the emotion of the face is
being processed automatically.

631
00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:02,970
The amygdala sees the emotion on the
faces at that moment and the machine,

632
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:07,200
it's like tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.
And they were hundreds of pictures.

633
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:10,120
10th of a second to 10th of a second.
A 10th of a second. That's right.

634
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:14,590
Did you see a difference between the
people who were depressed and the people

635
00:40:14,591 --> 00:40:16,900
who were normal? Yes.

636
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:22,090
Was it a significant difference or just
barely difference as a group it was a

637
00:40:22,091 --> 00:40:25,480
significant difference and
now she takes the big step.

638
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:29,860
Step four from the pattern
she sees in bunches of people,

639
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:32,950
she feeds all those patterns into
a computer called machine learning,

640
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:37,240
told the program. This is a pattern
of brain activity and depress people.

641
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:39,700
This is a pattern of brain
activity in healthy people.

642
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,170
And then she shows the computer
a brain scan of a new person.

643
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:46,960
So this is someone in the computers
never met before. Exactly.

644
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,720
And she did this a bunch of time,
right? A whole bunch of people

645
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:53,350
and each time the computer tries to get,

646
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:57,990
is this new person depressed
or not? Oh and and what?

647
00:40:57,991 --> 00:40:59,860
What happened? More than 85% of the time,

648
00:40:59,861 --> 00:41:04,861
86% of the time the algorithm correctly
diagnosed whether that person was

649
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,820
depressed or healthy

650
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:09,780
[inaudible]

651
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:12,660
with just a brain scan,
a computer and a patient.

652
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,700
No doctor needed Cynthia's
computer got the diagnosis right.

653
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:18,430
[inaudible]

654
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:23,320
6% of the time a computer. We saw the
results. I was like, wow, this is amazing.

655
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:28,540
Wait a second. Has she
repeated this? Well,

656
00:41:28,541 --> 00:41:31,900
this is actually the very first time that
this has been done with depression and

657
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:32,200
so it was

658
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,130
just a pilot study and like you say,

659
00:41:34,131 --> 00:41:36,560
someone else will have to do
it again and again and again,

660
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:39,020
but according to Cynthia
potentials, fantastic.

661
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,930
Psychiatry is going to be
absolutely revolutionized by this.

662
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:45,950
I think this method can be applied
to any psychiatric disorder,

663
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:50,540
any autism. It's a Freeney obsessive
compulsive disorder. No Way. Come on.

664
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:51,374
Why not?

665
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:56,830
Every one of these illnesses ultimately
must have an anatomical basis,

666
00:41:57,410 --> 00:41:59,180
every one of these illnesses,

667
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:04,210
so this means that it will soon or one
day be possible for a patient to come in

668
00:42:04,281 --> 00:42:08,930
and you take a picture of him in real
time or of her and you will have a

669
00:42:08,931 --> 00:42:12,650
diagnostic tool. That's what
you're saying? Absolutely.

670
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:14,151
Absolutely.

671
00:42:14,151 --> 00:42:17,750
You mean to tell me that they're going
to put people in machines and just go

672
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,770
boom, no, no, wait, wait, wait.

673
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:24,890
This is not a casual thing.
You go to the doctor,

674
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:27,350
you tell the doctor that
you're feeling a certain way.

675
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:30,020
The doctor will talk to you and
then he would come to you and say,

676
00:42:30,021 --> 00:42:33,410
well my learning and the test
tells me that you're ill.

677
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:37,250
So that's all it's happening here is now
the medical doctor was out at habitats.

678
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,970
We haven't, there's nothing in
this that feels invasive to you.

679
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:46,100
Well obviously huddling into the deep
depths of your personhood. No, this is,

680
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,390
if you believe that mental
illness is a mental illness,

681
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:53,390
it is a structural condition
which can be fixed.

682
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:57,440
So it's not the deep inner
you, it's the broken you.

683
00:42:57,810 --> 00:42:58,860
So it's like the broken arm.

684
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:02,670
You started off with it that c you would
put the two side by side think I would.

685
00:43:02,671 --> 00:43:04,650
And then of course you get
to the next, come on rubber.

686
00:43:04,651 --> 00:43:06,600
I mean human beings are
way too messy for that.

687
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:10,170
You're too messy for it to
be that easy. No, no way.

688
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:13,020
So you think this is out of science's
reach? Really? It's just too,

689
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:15,800
there's a part of me that does
think it is out of science.

690
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:20,580
Because you think you think that
they're looking deep inside you.

691
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:22,830
That's what you don't like. I
do. I mean, don't get me wrong,

692
00:43:22,831 --> 00:43:26,840
I find brain scans fascinating when it
comes to questions like where is the

693
00:43:26,841 --> 00:43:28,730
soul? Where does consciousness,
that kind of stuff,

694
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:31,940
but don't kind of get in my head and
tell me what's what's right and what's

695
00:43:31,941 --> 00:43:34,970
wrong. Sad and sick. Don't
you want to get better? Yes,

696
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:40,030
but I enjoy the comfortable ambiguity
that would come from a situation like

697
00:43:40,791 --> 00:43:43,340
sitting in a therapist office and
saying, well, I'm, how am I feeling?

698
00:43:43,341 --> 00:43:47,570
I'm feeling this way or that way and in
the messiness of trying to just rely on

699
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,980
how you're feeling, there's a vast
landscape of of things that can happen.

700
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:53,650
Choices. You can make, therapies
you can pursue this way.

701
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,770
Let's say you are sick and you know
that you're sick machine or no. Okay.

702
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:59,100
[inaudible] if you are feeling badly,

703
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,450
wouldn't it be nice if a machine could
help you find the right kind of help?

704
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:07,080
What do you mean? Well, Eric took me
through a little thought experiment,

705
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,153
a mind experiment.

706
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:11,760
You've developed a psychotherapy
and I've developed a psychotherapy.

707
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:13,830
We each claim it's the best in the world.

708
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:19,010
Now we have an objective way of seeing
this machine allows you to independently

709
00:44:19,831 --> 00:44:21,420
of any evaluation,

710
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:26,670
see the outcome of treatment
and so you can audit the doctor,

711
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:31,020
audit the doctor and give you evidence
that it's working or no. Okay.

712
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:36,210
Yeah, a little bit on board. I G I
can give you 10% buy in now. Okay,

713
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:39,240
so how far off is this stuff?
Is it going to come soon?

714
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:41,280
This is very early in the game obviously,

715
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:44,580
but I get ask him like how far into
the future are we talking about here?

716
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:47,520
Soon or mid after long after you're dead.

717
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:50,420
I'm going to be around a lot,

718
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:55,380
but the question stands,

719
00:44:55,381 --> 00:44:58,380
will you make it to see that
that people will actually have a,

720
00:44:58,381 --> 00:45:02,370
you don't want can't in
medicine in all honesty,

721
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:04,830
give a timeline for many of these things.

722
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:09,660
Can imaging methodology right now is
quite sophisticated but it's still

723
00:45:09,661 --> 00:45:11,550
primitive compared with needs to be.

724
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,640
You're picking this up in
status in this ascending.

725
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,980
You become excited as the
thing is beginning to emerge.

726
00:45:16,981 --> 00:45:18,920
We see it for the first
time on the horizon.

727
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:21,730
You saying we've got to the story
too early. That's what you're saying,

728
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:25,650
just right. It's not going to be
interesting. 20 years from now,

729
00:45:25,651 --> 00:45:26,484
it'll be obvious.

730
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:31,740
Or in 20 years it'll be obvious
that we were wrong. Okay.

731
00:45:31,741 --> 00:45:36,060
That's a real possibility because what
we don't know is alive. Vast. Yeah.

732
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:40,990
And a, I want to tell you a story now
about just how wrong people can be. Okay.

733
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,380
It begins with a mystery,
sudden infant death syndrome,

734
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:48,720
perfectly healthy child goes to
sleep and dies during the night.

735
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:51,530
[inaudible]

736
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:53,300
it's about the worst thing
that can happen to a parent.

737
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:58,130
And each year it does happen about 7,000
times. It's still, no one knows why.

738
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,140
Oh, and by the way, that
was Robert Sapolsky.

739
00:46:00,141 --> 00:46:03,530
He's a professor of neuroscience
at Stanford University,

740
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:08,390
and the Spolsky tells this story of the
moment sids was diagnosed for the first

741
00:46:08,391 --> 00:46:08,900
time,

742
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:13,900
or at least classified in a terrible
mistake that was made around 1900 or so.

743
00:46:14,181 --> 00:46:18,410
People were being made to recognize
this as a disease entity and nobody knew

744
00:46:18,411 --> 00:46:23,120
what was up. So people decided,
let's go dissect sid skids.

745
00:46:23,121 --> 00:46:27,400
Meaning when a baby would die, they
would perform an autopsy. Exactly, yes.

746
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,431
Checked the baby's inside.

747
00:46:28,431 --> 00:46:31,940
See if there's anything different in them
from normal kids. That seems logical.

748
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:32,833
Absolutely.

749
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:38,710
They measure the size of the
baby's lungs. Yep. Normal.

750
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:41,780
They measured the size of the heart.
Yep. Nothing strange there. Stomach,

751
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:46,640
kidney, liver. Yep. Those are all fine.
Then they would look in the throat.

752
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:48,560
[inaudible]

753
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,220
they look in there and they
say, oh my God, these sids kids,

754
00:46:52,221 --> 00:46:56,720
they have enormous famous
glance. The thymus of famous.

755
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:59,780
What is the famous, what is wonder? Well,

756
00:46:59,781 --> 00:47:02,690
it is a little tiny pink
gland that is right.

757
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:05,660
Your player red beyond
your color though, Huh?

758
00:47:05,810 --> 00:47:10,580
At the base of your throat and its job
is to help you fight disease makes one

759
00:47:10,581 --> 00:47:13,100
type of cell critical
to your immune system,

760
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:18,080
especially in times of stress. Any case,

761
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:23,410
normally this little organ is about
the size of a tiny tube of toothpaste,

762
00:47:23,661 --> 00:47:27,920
like the tribal coin, but in these
six kids it was huge. MongoDB,

763
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:30,700
enormous. Twice size. Exactly.

764
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:34,590
And since the thymus is
dangerously close to the windpipe,

765
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:38,500
doctors came up with a hypothesis,
perfectly reasonable hypothesis,

766
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:42,130
which was that maybe if you're one of
these babies with an enlarged thymus and

767
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:46,630
you're asleep and somehow you roll over
wrong [inaudible] well that gland might

768
00:47:46,631 --> 00:47:50,530
press down on your trachea and
suffocate you during the night. Oh, so

769
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:56,310
medical mystery solved. Really? No,

770
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,820
they even came up with a name for it.

771
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:02,290
It was called status find
mackolen phatic in the spoons.

772
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:08,950
It was an all the pediatric textbooks
by the 1920s and you would look in there

773
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,820
and there'd be pictures.

774
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:15,650
There would be pictures of the dissector
fine mrs normal size and here on the

775
00:48:15,651 --> 00:48:19,700
right in large abnormally large
status find the colon fat.

776
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:23,780
And in no time at all, doctors
came up with a treatment,

777
00:48:23,781 --> 00:48:27,290
perfectly logical therapy, which is that
if we're going to help these babies,

778
00:48:27,291 --> 00:48:29,570
we've got to shrink their
thymus gland. And to do that,

779
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:32,660
the best solution obviously is to

780
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:40,130
irradiate their throats or radiate their
throats to shrink their thymus gland.

781
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:41,203
Come on

782
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,730
the child's throat with trillions
of radioactive particles.

783
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,240
You literally, you Betcha.

784
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:52,990
And this was considered like something
every good loving parents should do.

785
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:57,040
Absolutely. If you worry about
your child being at risk for sids,

786
00:48:57,070 --> 00:49:01,750
go and get their throats irradiated to
shrink the thymus gland and did it work?

787
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:06,430
Yes. Shrank the thymus gland. But
he says it did have another effect.

788
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:10,960
Decades later. You've killed 20 to
30,000 people with thyroid cancer.

789
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:13,370
[inaudible]

790
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:18,290
20 30,000 deaths. That's a, that's
a real number. Yeah, that's a,

791
00:49:18,291 --> 00:49:21,470
that's a fairly big one.
So here's my question.

792
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:26,900
How could these doctors have
gotten it so, so, so, so, so wrong.

793
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:30,230
Do you know what I mean? Yeah, I
do. I don't. You know what you mean?

794
00:49:30,231 --> 00:49:33,360
You just answered your own question
a minute ago. No, no, I didn't.

795
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:36,590
I'm about to answer it right now.
They're, they're playing with radiation.

796
00:49:36,591 --> 00:49:38,270
You just said that. But what they, what?

797
00:49:38,271 --> 00:49:41,090
They didn't know that radiation would
hurt you. They had no, it was like,

798
00:49:41,091 --> 00:49:43,960
that's not technology, but
that's not what I was going to

799
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:47,400
[inaudible].

800
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:51,600
This was, you know, a couple of decades
into radiation having been discovered.

801
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:56,130
I could cope, start performing near
miracles of diagnosis and discovery.

802
00:49:56,131 --> 00:49:59,130
People were just tossing around
radiation all over the place.

803
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:04,110
Iodine one 31 radioactive sodium right
off gamma rays neutron and this was a

804
00:50:04,111 --> 00:50:08,340
period with madame Curie dipping
her arm into vats of uranium.

805
00:50:08,370 --> 00:50:12,480
Radioactivity is harmless in
dying. Soon afterwards from cancer,

806
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:17,850
people who would go into shoe stores
and they would have their feet. Yes,

807
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:21,350
x ray is a wonderful invention.
I had that. You had that.

808
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:25,040
I did naturally take off your shoes
and you can look at your balloons.

809
00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:27,950
That's exactly what that, how
would you do? That's what that was.

810
00:50:27,951 --> 00:50:31,350
That was the thing you could do at the
shoe store. It was very cool. Yeah.

811
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:34,120
Showing how cutting edge of a
shoe store or they aren't yet

812
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,113
[inaudible]

813
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:40,060
your explanation. No, that
may look like the explanation.

814
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:42,580
I made sure every radiation, we
played a role, but if you would have,

815
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:46,420
let me say what I was going to say, I
would have told you the real explanation.

816
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:50,060
Yes. Preceded the radiation by
like a couple hundred years. Hello?

817
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:51,460
I don't no idea what you're talking.

818
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:55,750
I'm going to tell you back in the
17 hundreds okay. That far back,

819
00:50:55,780 --> 00:51:00,600
that far back before radiation,
before your grandpa four, uh,

820
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:03,610
before the civil war or the
Eiffel tower or Napoleon,

821
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:07,690
I'm talking when the red coats
were still wearing red. Yeah. Yeah.

822
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:12,510
This was shortly after the revolutionary
war. Right about this time says,

823
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:17,290
supposedly the first med schools started
to pop up in America and a supply and

824
00:51:17,291 --> 00:51:21,410
demand issue came into effect because
with these med schools came med students,

825
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:24,430
all students who needed to learn about
anatomy and of course in order to do

826
00:51:24,431 --> 00:51:27,580
that, they needed bodies, you know,

827
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:30,850
to dissect this produced
this whole occupation.

828
00:51:30,851 --> 00:51:34,330
You could be a resurrection
or resurrect Shanice. Yup.

829
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:39,430
And they would go out and dig
up bodies that's at night.

830
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:46,650
Then sell them to the anatomist
as the medical schools.

831
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:53,430
I'll need two more by Thursday. Dang. Now,

832
00:51:53,431 --> 00:51:56,040
here's the key points.
Since demand was so high,

833
00:51:56,580 --> 00:52:00,000
the resurrection just had to go
where the bodies were easiest to get,

834
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:04,500
which meant, you know,
avoiding the fancy graveyards.

835
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,000
If you were wealthy,

836
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:09,690
you could have yourself buried in
what was called a patent coffin,

837
00:52:11,310 --> 00:52:14,820
which was a tripled way or coffin, which
was meant to be resurrection as proof.

838
00:52:16,410 --> 00:52:21,150
But if you are not wealthy,
no fancy coffin for you,

839
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:24,000
you'd probably just be buried
in a sack in some poppers field,

840
00:52:24,001 --> 00:52:25,740
just a few inches under the soil.

841
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:30,630
Very accessible for these
resurrection lists. Not surprisingly,

842
00:52:31,770 --> 00:52:35,520
that's where they weren't
always telling the same topic.

843
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:38,930
Are you explaining why children
died there? Me. Alright.

844
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:43,650
What I'm trying to make is that the grave
robbers targeted the poor so much so

845
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:45,930
it's sometimes when they, you know,

846
00:52:45,931 --> 00:52:48,870
people would catch these resurrection
that's in the act and see like, oh my God,

847
00:52:48,871 --> 00:52:52,050
that's my dad. You're
digging up. There'd be riots.

848
00:52:54,810 --> 00:52:58,220
Stop stealing off treats.

849
00:52:58,330 --> 00:53:02,990
We're called out and wires were shot.
Are we talking like hundreds of people?

850
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:08,000
Torch bearing was townies versus the
people you were trying to dissect their

851
00:53:08,001 --> 00:53:11,260
dead relatives. This

852
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:14,170
is a lot of history. I'm
very fascinated in quotes.

853
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:17,890
What does this have to do with kids dying
of fire? Right? Let me bring it home.

854
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,270
Not that it hasn't been interesting,
but bring it home. Okay.

855
00:53:20,590 --> 00:53:24,850
As a result of all of this hubbub over
a grave robbing country after country

856
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:28,950
Europe decided, no, let's standardize
how science gets it's cadavers.

857
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:30,120
Forget all this grave robbing.

858
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:35,330
So they passed laws which formalized
anyone who died in a poor house,

859
00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:38,520
a, their body would be turned
over to the anatomists.

860
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:41,520
This was like the cadaver version
of direct deposit. Okay, so great.

861
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:45,690
Robyn was gone, but now all the bodies
used by medicine and not just some,

862
00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:50,870
but nearly all now came from the poor
estimates were by the end of that century,

863
00:53:51,481 --> 00:53:53,430
99% of the body's used for,

864
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:58,730
for anatomy lessons had been derived from
poor houses and that seemed okay until

865
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:04,610
1936 a guy named Hans Lea showed that
being poor actually warps your body.

866
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:08,940
And now Robert,

867
00:54:08,941 --> 00:54:12,600
now we come back to the gates of
the mysteriously enlarged thymus.

868
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:16,530
Cause if you're poor, you're
either worried about your job,

869
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:19,350
you're worried about feeding your
family, you're worried about the bills.

870
00:54:19,351 --> 00:54:19,831
In other words,

871
00:54:19,831 --> 00:54:24,831
you are stressed out and during chronic
stress your immune system goes down the

872
00:54:25,981 --> 00:54:28,860
tubes. And since the time is
this part of the immune system,

873
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:31,860
if you are chronically stressed,
the thymus gland shrinks.

874
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:39,830
[inaudible] for 150 years, doctors
had been dissecting cadavers,

875
00:54:40,430 --> 00:54:43,160
pointing at organs which
they thought were normal,

876
00:54:43,161 --> 00:54:46,640
but which were in fact shrunken from a
life of poverty and stress and saying

877
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:48,200
that's normal.

878
00:54:48,770 --> 00:54:52,610
So that when these sids babies show up
with these gigantic Thomas', oh my God,

879
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:56,570
in fact, that was the first time
they'd ever seen a normal one.

880
00:54:56,571 --> 00:55:00,560
People had no idea what was normal
and what was abnormal and they got it

881
00:55:00,561 --> 00:55:01,394
backwards.

882
00:55:36,950 --> 00:55:37,783
[inaudible]

883
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:40,400
Robert Sapolsky, a professor of
neuroscience at Stanford University.

884
00:55:40,401 --> 00:55:43,460
He's the author of many great
books including monkey love,

885
00:55:43,461 --> 00:55:46,920
the trouble with testosterone from our
information on him or anything that you

889
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:00,860
