I think there's certainly some

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250
I think there's certainly some
 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.400
I think there's certainly some
possibilities coming up some of the

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410
possibilities coming up some of the
 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.509
possibilities coming up some of the
things that are out there are sort of

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519
things that are out there are sort of
 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.030
things that are out there are sort of
implanted devices they're not available

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040
implanted devices they're not available
 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.919
implanted devices they're not available
in united states yet trials may be

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929
in united states yet trials may be

coming soon one is a balloon they you

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350
coming soon one is a balloon they you
 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.980
coming soon one is a balloon they you
know the old stomach balloon didn't work

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990
know the old stomach balloon didn't work
 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.720
know the old stomach balloon didn't work
real well but there's better designs now

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730
real well but there's better designs now
 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.670
real well but there's better designs now
they can be put in for about six months

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680
they can be put in for about six months
 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.470
they can be put in for about six months
and they cause people to lose about a

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480
and they cause people to lose about a
 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.599
and they cause people to lose about a
third of their excess weight quarter to

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609
third of their excess weight quarter to
 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.279
third of their excess weight quarter to
a third of their excess weight which is

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289
a third of their excess weight which is
 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.960
a third of their excess weight which is
about as good as the best diets out

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970
about as good as the best diets out
 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.299
about as good as the best diets out
there but this is really a simpler way

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309
there but this is really a simpler way
 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.880
there but this is really a simpler way
for patients to do it in a sense on the

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890
for patients to do it in a sense on the
 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.920
for patients to do it in a sense on the
other hand it has to be removed and like

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930
other hand it has to be removed and like
 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.240
other hand it has to be removed and like
I said once you remove it unless you

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250
I said once you remove it unless you
 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.040
I said once you remove it unless you
change your life habits the weight can

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050
change your life habits the weight can
 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.510
change your life habits the weight can
come back there's other implanted

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520
come back there's other implanted
 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.889
come back there's other implanted
devices that are coming along the way

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899
devices that are coming along the way
 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.119
devices that are coming along the way
also I think these are going to be

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129
also I think these are going to be
 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.580
also I think these are going to be
temporary aids but there are some

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590
temporary aids but there are some
 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.830
temporary aids but there are some
devices now that allow stapling with

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840
devices now that allow stapling with
 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.020
devices now that allow stapling with
from within the stomach so it's not

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030
from within the stomach so it's not
 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.150
from within the stomach so it's not
truly even surgery anymore we're talking

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160
truly even surgery anymore we're talking
 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.770
truly even surgery anymore we're talking
about going in down the mouth through

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780
about going in down the mouth through
 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.090
about going in down the mouth through
the esophagus into the stomach and

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100
the esophagus into the stomach and
 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.740
the esophagus into the stomach and
grabbing the walls of the stomach and

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750
grabbing the walls of the stomach and
 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.299
grabbing the walls of the stomach and
stitching them or stapling them together

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309
stitching them or stapling them together
 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.700
stitching them or stapling them together
to cause restriction to food intake to

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710
to cause restriction to food intake to
 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.770
to cause restriction to food intake to
make you feel full faster so it's not an

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780
make you feel full faster so it's not an
 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.030
make you feel full faster so it's not an
operation where anything is being cut

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040
operation where anything is being cut
 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.160
operation where anything is being cut
from the outside for sure and those

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170
from the outside for sure and those
 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.539
from the outside for sure and those
things are potentially exciting and that

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549
things are potentially exciting and that
 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.149
things are potentially exciting and that
they may have some permanence and even

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159
they may have some permanence and even
 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.679
they may have some permanence and even
if they don't have permanence and need

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689
if they don't have permanence and need
 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.320
if they don't have permanence and need
to be touched up they can be redone like

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330
to be touched up they can be redone like
 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.910
to be touched up they can be redone like
an endoscopy going down into the stomach

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920
an endoscopy going down into the stomach
 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.249
an endoscopy going down into the stomach
without surgery right now they still

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259
without surgery right now they still
 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.469
without surgery right now they still
require general anesthesia some of these

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479
require general anesthesia some of these
 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.840
require general anesthesia some of these
but but some of them don't and all the

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850
but but some of them don't and all the
 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.460
but but some of them don't and all the
others of them with time and refinement

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470
others of them with time and refinement
 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.260
others of them with time and refinement
may not require so it may be like coming

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270
may not require so it may be like coming
 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.120
may not require so it may be like coming
in for an endoscopy to just have a look

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130
in for an endoscopy to just have a look
 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.740
in for an endoscopy to just have a look
in your stomach here we just put down a

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750
in your stomach here we just put down a
 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.359
in your stomach here we just put down a
device and can put some more stitches in

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369
device and can put some more stitches in
 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.100
device and can put some more stitches in
or some more staples in and those things

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110
or some more staples in and those things
 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.780
or some more staples in and those things
are coming we're actually planning some

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790
are coming we're actually planning some
 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.249
are coming we're actually planning some
trials at Columbia with those things in

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259
trials at Columbia with those things in
 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.960
trials at Columbia with those things in
the very near future actually someone

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970
the very near future actually someone
 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.850
the very near future actually someone
just starting up now and so I think

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860
just starting up now and so I think
 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.020
just starting up now and so I think
we're going to learn a lot about this

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030
we're going to learn a lot about this
 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.049
we're going to learn a lot about this
over the next three to five years
