00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.840
Okay, I hope this question was fairly straightforward

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.970
and easy for you. If we're going to look

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.390
at the heterozygous allelic combinations, we're looking for

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.770
any combinations where the letters aren't the same.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.941
So that would be a thiamine-guanine match, a

00:00:13.941 --> 00:00:18.410
guanine-cytosine match, and a cytosine-thiamine match. The others

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.520
don't fit, because they would be homozygous, because

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.840
both Letters in the pair are the same.
