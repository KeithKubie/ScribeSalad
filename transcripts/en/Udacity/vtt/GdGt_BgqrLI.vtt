00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.054
Right, so, I was clicking around. I clicked here. It

00:00:03.054 --> 00:00:05.810
seems like I can access a bunch of my objects.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:06.440
&gt;&gt; Yup.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.939
&gt;&gt;

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.690
clicked here, and this was interesting. So, what's going on with these guys?

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.220
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, remember earlier when we overrode the global action layout

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.450
to be able to put in our create a set time action?

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:20.030
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.310
&gt;&gt; This is the global layout that you'll see from anywhere

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.570
inside this mobile app, if you haven't overrode the global layout.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.940
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.480
&gt;&gt; So you can create a Chatter post, create a new contact, maybe create

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.520
a task. All of these things are

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.800
actions that are quickly available to mobile users

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.250
to do from anywhere in the app.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.570
&gt;&gt; Okay. So presumably that means. The the

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.930
action I made, the make a new set time.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:41.270
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.290
&gt;&gt; I can do that from my phone.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.850
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Super easy.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:44.710
&gt;&gt; So how would I do that?

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.100
&gt;&gt; Okay, so close the global actions. And if you scroll down. You can

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.250
see that we can click straight into

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.730
that Udacity Stage record. Like we saw earlier.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:53.970
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.360
&gt;&gt; But instead of going that direction. Let's just use the

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.110
mobile navigation by clicking that little icon in the corner, yep.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.860
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:00.780
&gt;&gt; And then scroll up.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.530
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.265
&gt;&gt; To the Show More. Click that guy, and just go to

00:01:04.265 --> 00:01:07.883
the Stage tab, and we'll go straight to the record this way.

00:01:07.883 --> 00:01:09.139
&gt;&gt; Okay, the Udacity Stage?

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:11.702
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:01:11.702 --> 00:01:14.788
&gt;&gt; Now, plus has at a set time.

00:01:14.788 --> 00:01:15.121
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:15.121 --> 00:01:19.020
&gt;&gt; It's pretty cool. Okay, so if I hit add a set time,

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.090
as I expect, has all these fields. So say it's just December 1st.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.930
&gt;&gt; Sounds good.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.613
&gt;&gt; status is new. Oh, cool, it has the automatic thing.

00:01:29.613 --> 00:01:30.250
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.750
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.770
Time. I really like how it automates the pick list.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.650
&gt;&gt; It just knows.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:39.040
&gt;&gt;

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.500
&gt;&gt; Set the Udacity stage, and let's pick a band.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.570
&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's go with U3 in.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:53.590
&gt;&gt; Alright, so what we're looking at right now is the Udacity stage, you

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.570
know mobile page layout. It shows us all the fields that we saw in the computer.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.954
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:56.954 --> 00:01:57.275
&gt;&gt; Right?

00:01:57.275 --> 00:01:57.684
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:57.684 --> 00:01:57.860
&gt;&gt; But,

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.180
we can scroll left and right. And see different things on

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.550
this. So in this case, on this first window we can see

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.620
the Chatter feed. And so this is the set time we just

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.949
created, and here's the set time we created in the app earlier.

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:10.761
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:10.761 --> 00:02:14.320
&gt;&gt; Now if we scroll to the right, we can see

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.950
the related lists of all the things related to this Udacity Stage.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.980
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.460
&gt;&gt; So like the set times we just created.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.640
&gt;&gt; Makes sense. Cool.
