00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:02.870
So here, we have an
interesting reaction.

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.710
We have some iron with
some hydrochloric acid,

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.460
if we are assuming it's
in an aqueous solution.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.350
And as a product, we
get iron II chloride.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.960
And you'll see in a second why
it's called iron II chloride.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.910
And you get some
molecular hydrogen.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.620
And what I encourage you to do
right now is pause this video,

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.890
figure out the oxidation
states for each

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.900
of the components of these
molecules before the reaction

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.780
and after the
reaction, and then try

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.880
to write your own half
reactions and determine

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.450
who has been oxidized
and who has been reduced.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.651
So I'm assuming you've
given a go at it.

00:00:40.651 --> 00:00:41.650
So let's think about it.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.950
So right here, this iron,
it's not bonding to anything.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.110
So there's no reason that its
going to gain electrons or lose

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.000
electrons in our hypothetical
oxidation state world.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.090
So it has an
oxidation number of 0.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.550
Now, you have hydrogen
bonded to chlorine.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.930
Chlorine is very
electronegative, hydrogen not

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:01.810
so much.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.840
So chlorine, in our
hypothetical world,

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.459
is going to take the electrons.

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:08.850
So it's going to have an
oxidation number of negative 1.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.630
And the hydrogen is going to,
in our hypothetical world,

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.310
lose the electron.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.400
And so you have a positive
1 oxidation number.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.370
We could write 1 plus
here if we wanted or 1

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.010
minus there if we
want on the chlorine.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.390
Now let's go on to the
other side of the reaction.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.470
So our iron now is
bonded to two chlorines.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.120
Now let's just think about
what chlorine typically does.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.750
We've already seen chlorine.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.630
It's Group 7 element
right over here.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.890
It would love nothing more than
to gain an electron so that it

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.550
has a complete eight electrons
in its valence electron shell.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.270
And so it typically
has an oxidation number

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.180
when it's bonded with
other things of negative 1.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.930
Since I'm not writing
it as a superscript,

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.160
I could just write
it as negative 1.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.690
So let's go with the flow there.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.820
Let's assume that each
of these chlorines

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.290
are taking an electron.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.970
So it has an oxidation number or
oxidation state of negative 1.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.430
Well, if each of these have an
oxidation state of negative 1,

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.370
and this whole thing,
this iron II chloride is

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.125
a neutral molecule,
then the iron

00:02:18.125 --> 00:02:20.250
is going to have to-- you'll
see 2 times negative 1

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.210
is negative 2.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.650
The iron, in order
to net out, is

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:29.230
going to have to have a
positive 2 oxidation number.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.200
And that is why this is indeed
called iron II chloride.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.930
The iron II tells us that the
oxidation number on the iron

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.640
is positive 2, iron II chloride.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.280
And what about the
hydrogens here?

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.960
Well, hydrogen
bonded to hydrogen.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.490
There's no reason why
one hydrogen would hog it

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.960
from the other hydrogen
or let their electrons be

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.710
hogged by another hydrogen.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.010
And so, each of
these hydrogens would

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.661
have a oxidation state of 0.

00:02:58.661 --> 00:03:00.410
Now, let's think about
the half reactions,

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.420
decide who's getting oxidized
and who's getting reduced.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.890
So let's start with the iron.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.720
So the iron on the left hand
side, 0 oxidation number.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.650
And then on the
right hand side, iron

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.720
has a positive 2
oxidation number.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.710
So how do you go
from 0 to positive?

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.200
Well, you've got
to lose electrons.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.830
Every time you lose an
electron, your oxidation number,

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.496
your hypothetical charge-- or if
you're really losing electrons,

00:03:30.496 --> 00:03:32.140
your real charge--
is going to go up.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.150
It's going to become
more positive.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.100
So this character right over
here, he is losing electrons.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.650
So we could say this right
over-- he has lost electrons.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.045
So let's throw those electrons.

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.500
Here he hypothetically had them.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.340
Here he lost them.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.423
Where are those electrons?

00:03:52.423 --> 00:03:54.500
They are right over here.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.290
So what do we call it when
you are losing electrons?

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.360
Well, we call that oxidation.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.760
What is being done to you
is what oxygen typically

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.541
does to things.

00:04:02.541 --> 00:04:03.540
It takes electrons away.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.690
Even though there's
no oxygen here,

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.100
this oxygen typically
takes electrons away.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.720
He's having his electrons
taken away from him.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.280
So he is being oxidized.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.530
So the iron is being oxidized.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.000
Now, let's think
about the hydrogens.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.400
On the left-hand side,
you have two hydrogens

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.030
with a plus 1 oxidation number.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.490
Now, on the right-hand side,
you have still two hydrogens.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.890
Otherwise, it wouldn't
be a balanced equation.

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.570
You have two hydrogens.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.520
But what's their
oxidation number now?

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.470
It is now is 0.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.340
So how do you go from
having a positive oxidation

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.670
number to a neutral one?

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:55.197
So you must have
gained electrons.

00:04:55.197 --> 00:04:56.905
That's the only way
to bring your charge,

00:04:56.905 --> 00:04:59.400
your hypothetical charge
or your real charge down,

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.160
is to gain electrons.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.770
So this guy right over
here, each of the hydrogens

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.230
must have gained an electron.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.500
There's two of them,
so collectively they

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.935
must have gained two electrons.

00:05:10.935 --> 00:05:12.310
So what do we call
it when you're

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.460
gaining electrons
in these reactions?

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.200
Well, reduction
is gaining-- RIG.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.560
Hydrogen is being reduced here.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.760
Let me write that down.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.520
So hydrogen is being reduced.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.530
Now what about the chlorine?

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.430
Chlorine has a
negative 1 oxidation

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.010
state on the left-hand side.

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:37.830
And there's two of them.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.250
And there's two chlorines
on the right-hand side.

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.270
But they still each have a
negative 1 oxidation state.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.680
So the chlorine was neither
oxidized nor reduced

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.970
in this reaction.

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.840
But this is definitely an
oxidation-reduction reaction,

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.710
or a redox reaction, because
you had something getting

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.300
oxidized and something
being reduced.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.060
Iron was oxidized
by the hydrogen,

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.539
and the hydrogen was
reduced by the iron.
