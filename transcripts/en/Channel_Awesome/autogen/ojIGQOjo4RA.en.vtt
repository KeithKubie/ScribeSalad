okay I'll be this new hold on I'd like
to just take this really quickly all she

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300
to just take this really quickly all she
 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.960
to just take this really quickly all she
did was laugh when he said it she didn't

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970
did was laugh when he said it she didn't
 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.730
did was laugh when he said it she didn't
say no she didn't say you can't you

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740
say no she didn't say you can't you
 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.680
say no she didn't say you can't you
didn't say you were a boy sure she left

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690
didn't say you were a boy sure she left
 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.379
didn't say you were a boy sure she left
that that was it but the implications

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389
that that was it but the implications
 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:43.450
that that was it but the implications
yeah but that's the thing though again

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460
yeah but that's the thing though again
 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.909
yeah but that's the thing though again
no pun intended but are we supposed to

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919
no pun intended but are we supposed to
 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:47.920
no pun intended but are we supposed to
handle kids with kid gloves

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930
handle kids with kid gloves
 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.170

I mean are we not able to laugh when
 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.870
I mean are we not able to laugh when
they say something or could potentially

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880
they say something or could potentially
 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.909
they say something or could potentially
be damaging them you know everything is

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:54.919
be damaging them you know everything is
 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:58.270
be damaging them you know everything is
potentially damaged funny lame excuse

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280
potentially damaged funny lame excuse
 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.550
potentially damaged funny lame excuse
well I think that's the point is that

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560
well I think that's the point is that
 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.439
well I think that's the point is that
anything and everything is potentially

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:02.449
anything and everything is potentially
 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:04.210
anything and everything is potentially
damaging that's why we have to be more

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220
damaging that's why we have to be more
 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.339
damaging that's why we have to be more
aware of our actions

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:06.349
aware of our actions
 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:08.740
aware of our actions
bullcrap but you just saying that but PB

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750
bullcrap but you just saying that but PB
 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.540
bullcrap but you just saying that but PB
may be the right one Ryder's gonna

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550
may be the right one Ryder's gonna
 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.070
may be the right one Ryder's gonna
commit suicide because you know they

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080
commit suicide because you know they
 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.930
commit suicide because you know they
work very hard on it be careful with

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940
work very hard on it be careful with
 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:24.459
work very hard on it be careful with
what you're saying I'm sorry I I guess

00:05:24.459 --> 00:05:24.469
what you're saying I'm sorry I I guess
 

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:26.589

it's like yeah because once we start
 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.029
it's like yeah because once we start
going down that route then we're only

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:34.039
going down that route then we're only
 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:37.149
going down that route then we're only
gonna be able to say hi well I think

00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:37.159
gonna be able to say hi well I think
 

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:40.480
gonna be able to say hi well I think
with everything I mean a majority of

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490
with everything I mean a majority of
 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.779
with everything I mean a majority of
extremes if I do not work out but you

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:43.789
extremes if I do not work out but you
 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:45.159
extremes if I do not work out but you
see I didn't say all extremes does that

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169
see I didn't say all extremes does that
 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:48.939
see I didn't say all extremes does that
mean extreme times he names strangers

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:48.949
mean extreme times he names strangers
 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:51.640
mean extreme times he names strangers
times where you don't um but majority of

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650
times where you don't um but majority of
 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.159
times where you don't um but majority of
times is trying to find that balance and

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:54.169
times is trying to find that balance and
 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:56.019
times is trying to find that balance and
it's like that's exactly what you have

00:05:56.019 --> 00:05:56.029

to do I mean there's no like
 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.309
to do I mean there's no like
mathematical equation here's how you

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:00.319
mathematical equation here's how you
 

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:01.209
mathematical equation here's how you
raise a kid

00:06:01.209 --> 00:06:01.219
raise a kid
 

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:02.680

here's what screw it out there what
 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.540
here's what screw it out there what
won't if this kid has these conditions

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550
won't if this kid has these conditions
 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:05.980
won't if this kid has these conditions
and this will not screw them up and it's

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990
and this will not screw them up and it's
 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.240
