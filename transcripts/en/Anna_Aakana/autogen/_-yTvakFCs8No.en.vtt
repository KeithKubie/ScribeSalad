00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.540
 One day my boyfriend asked me: 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.320
 Hey, if you could travel in time and choose your own period. where would you go 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.920
 and I laughed and said: 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.540
 Nowhere. this is the best time to be an asian woman. 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.140
 Dur! 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.900
 He looked very surprised for a moment before he realized. 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:23.400
 Oh. 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.760
 because of this i started to think of a saying that very much 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.880
 our cultural consciousness has been going around lately. 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.920
 "check your privilege" 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.520
 so actually says "check your privilege" 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.220
 Yo. when you consider someone else's condition 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.900
 then be aware of the specific privileges in which you were born 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.980
 so that you can put them aside and accurately try to understand 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.720
 how someone else's situation might be. 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.440
 so when my boyfriend said: 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.140
 I never thought about it that way 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.540
 I started to wonder: what is my privilege? 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.980
 and I do have a few. I mean. i was born in a family 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.500
 who placed a lot of value in study 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.900
 okay darling, i'll give you a cent for every page. 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.360
 because I am stingy as f * ck, I had a lot of incentive to study. 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.220
 your daughters is the first in our primary school that 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.020
 has read the entire section of the young adult library. 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.300
 money money money. 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.680
 my father was in the army. 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.340
 so I was exposed to many different cultures and countries. 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.980
 and people. this has given me a number of dialects 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.300
 who are very embarrassing now. 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.940
 when i was a kid. I lived in North Carolina 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.860
 * speaks Japanese * 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.760
 okay bruh we hunted that motha fucka to the parking lot. 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.160
 oh em gee. are you bitches to talking about sush sush? 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.640
 we really have to go to the Suga Fish. (restaurant) it's great. 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.440
 and after puberty, I started to be seen as cute. 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.960
 often beautiful. which I walked a lot on the way 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.900
 now as you can see i have this graph. the prettier you are 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.040
 the more cats your potential partner will allow. 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.700
 in the end I hope that by having this thought it makes me a better person. 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.580
 and that I can sympathize more with other people and their problems. 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.480
 like not everyone is born with parents see still being together. 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.480
 and can stand behind their dreams. or that she lived in a normal family 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.360
 or in which they were taught to start working very young. 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.280
 or experienced the world and were exposed to different things. 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.540
 it's so easy to look at someone through your own little lens 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.760
 and write off the things they have trouble with. 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.100
 or say that someone's problem is simply used as an excuse or complaint. 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.000
 it's a lot harder to keep your own opportunities in mind. 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.700
 only because of the place where you were born. 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.840
 I am certainly guilty of doing that. 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.880
 altogether. we are moving in the direction of empathy. 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.920
 and I think that's great. 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.960
 which reminds me. I asked my boyfriend: 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.040
 if you could travel time to any period in time where would you go? 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.340
 the 1960's 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:34.920
 Cool. 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.580
 I have no idea where Asian people were in the 60s 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.400
 I'm not sure either 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.540
 where were we? 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.400
 I'm Anna Akane. stay great Gotham. 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.260
