00:00:00.512 --> 00:00:02.172
- What I want to do in
this video is think about

00:00:02.172 --> 00:00:06.595
the different ways to
represent a molecule.

00:00:06.595 --> 00:00:10.299
So the most obvious way is its name.

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:13.050
So, for example, you could be referring to

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.439
a molecule of benzene.

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:17.717
Benzene.

00:00:17.717 --> 00:00:20.259
But just the word "benzene"
tells you very little

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:22.755
about what actually
makes up this molecule.

00:00:22.755 --> 00:00:24.717
And there's other naming
conventions that do

00:00:24.717 --> 00:00:26.304
give more information, but you might say,

00:00:26.304 --> 00:00:28.321
well, I actually want to know more about

00:00:28.321 --> 00:00:31.676
the actual particular
elements that make it up.

00:00:31.676 --> 00:00:34.160
Well, that might be, in that case,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.898
it might be useful to move
up to the empirical formula.

00:00:37.898 --> 00:00:41.900
Empirical, empirical.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.547
Empirical.

00:00:44.547 --> 00:00:46.674
Empirical formula.

00:00:46.674 --> 00:00:48.509
And you might be thinking, what does

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:50.433
empirical mean?

00:00:50.433 --> 00:00:53.532
In general, the word "empirical"
is referring to something

00:00:53.532 --> 00:00:57.805
that comes from observation
or comes through experiments.

00:00:57.805 --> 00:01:01.406
If you could say hey, you
know, I from empirical evidence

00:01:01.406 --> 00:01:03.662
I now believe this, this
means that you saw data.

00:01:03.662 --> 00:01:06.508
This means that you have
some observations that

00:01:06.508 --> 00:01:08.470
make you think this new thing.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.664
The reason why we call what
I'm about to write down

00:01:10.664 --> 00:01:14.554
the empirical formula, is
because early chemists,

00:01:14.554 --> 00:01:16.441
they can't look, they
weren't able to look at

00:01:16.442 --> 00:01:18.716
just one molecule, but
they could at least come up

00:01:18.716 --> 00:01:22.872
with, they could observe
the ratios of the different

00:01:22.872 --> 00:01:25.625
elements that they had in a molecule.

00:01:25.625 --> 00:01:27.715
So an empirical formula gives you a ratio

00:01:27.715 --> 00:01:30.604
of the elements in the molecule.

00:01:30.604 --> 00:01:34.954
So an empirical formula for benzene is ...

00:01:34.954 --> 00:01:37.180
It is ...

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.873
One carbon for

00:01:39.873 --> 00:01:43.550
every, for every hydrogen.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.260
Now you might say, OK, that's nice,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.059
I now know that if I'm
dealing with benzene

00:01:47.059 --> 00:01:48.692
I have one carbon for every hydrogen

00:01:48.692 --> 00:01:50.352
or one hydrogen for every carbon,

00:01:50.352 --> 00:01:53.800
but what does, how many of
each of these do you actually

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.014
have in a benzene molecule?

00:01:58.014 --> 00:02:00.522
To answer that question,
that's when you would want

00:02:00.522 --> 00:02:03.517
to go to the molecular formula.

00:02:03.517 --> 00:02:05.816
Molecular.

00:02:05.816 --> 00:02:09.042
Molecular formula.

00:02:09.042 --> 00:02:11.121
And the molecular formula
for benzene, which is

00:02:11.121 --> 00:02:13.092
now going to give us more information than

00:02:13.092 --> 00:02:16.902
the empirical formula,
tells us that each benzene

00:02:16.902 --> 00:02:21.310
molecule has six hydrogens, and,

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.471
sorry, six carbons and six,

00:02:24.471 --> 00:02:27.126
(laughs) I'm really having trouble today,

00:02:27.126 --> 00:02:31.526
six hydrogens, (laughs) six carbons, and,

00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:32.954
six hydrogens.

00:02:32.954 --> 00:02:34.773
Now, the ratio is still
one to one, you get that

00:02:34.773 --> 00:02:36.932
right over here, it's very easy to go from

00:02:36.932 --> 00:02:39.870
a molecular formula to
an empirical formula.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.849
You essentially are losing information.

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.178
You're just saying the ratio, OK, look,

00:02:43.178 --> 00:02:44.594
it's a ratio of six to six,

00:02:44.594 --> 00:02:46.671
which is the same thing as one to one.

00:02:46.671 --> 00:02:51.436
If we wanted to, we
could write this as C one

00:02:51.436 --> 00:02:53.972
H one just like that to
show us that the ratio

00:02:53.972 --> 00:02:56.248
for every carbon we have a hydrogen.

00:02:56.248 --> 00:02:58.843
And we see that that's actually
the case in one molecule,

00:02:58.843 --> 00:03:01.089
for every six carbons
you have six hydrogens,

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:03.411
which is still a one to one ratio.

00:03:03.411 --> 00:03:05.654
That may not satisfy you, you might say,

00:03:05.654 --> 00:03:07.849
well, OK, but how are these six carbons

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.325
and six hydrogens actually structured?

00:03:10.325 --> 00:03:12.558
I want more information.

00:03:12.558 --> 00:03:15.263
And for that, you would wanna go to

00:03:15.263 --> 00:03:17.979
a structural formula.

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:20.755
Structural formula,

00:03:20.755 --> 00:03:23.296
which will actually
give you the structure,

00:03:23.296 --> 00:03:26.455
or start to give you the
structure of a benzene molecule.

00:03:26.455 --> 00:03:30.263
A benzene molecule would be drawn like...

00:03:30.263 --> 00:03:33.676
So you would have six
carbons in a hexagon.

00:03:33.676 --> 00:03:37.739
So one, going to write this way, one, two,

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.463
three, four, five, six

00:03:42.463 --> 00:03:44.786
carbons in a hexagon just like that.

00:03:44.786 --> 00:03:47.432
And then you have a
double bond, every other

00:03:47.432 --> 00:03:51.473
of these bonds on the
hexagon is a double bond.

00:03:51.473 --> 00:03:54.238
Each of these carbons are
also attached to a hydrogen,

00:03:54.238 --> 00:03:56.178
also bonded to a hydrogen.

00:03:56.178 --> 00:03:58.940
Each of these lines that I'm drawing,

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.041
this is a bond, it's a covalent bond,

00:04:01.041 --> 00:04:03.061
we go into much more depth
in other videos on that,

00:04:03.061 --> 00:04:05.117
but it's a sharing of
electrons, and that's what keeps

00:04:05.117 --> 00:04:07.752
these carbons near each
other and what keeps

00:04:07.752 --> 00:04:09.772
the hydrogens kind of tied to each, or,

00:04:09.772 --> 00:04:11.512
the hydrogens tied to the
carbons and the carbons

00:04:11.512 --> 00:04:12.952
tied to the hydrogens.

00:04:12.952 --> 00:04:15.251
So let me draw it just like this.

00:04:15.251 --> 00:04:19.053
And this is only one
variant of a structural,

00:04:19.053 --> 00:04:22.179
it's hard to see this one I just drew,

00:04:22.179 --> 00:04:24.269
so let me see if I can do a little bit...

00:04:24.269 --> 00:04:26.077
Oh, that's about as good,
hopefully you see there's

00:04:26.077 --> 00:04:28.910
a hydrogen there, and there's
a hydrogen right over there.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.979
This is one variant of
a structural formula,

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:32.742
some structural formulas
will actually give you

00:04:32.742 --> 00:04:35.660
some 3D information, will
tell you whether a molecule

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.992
is kind of popping in or out of the page.

00:04:37.992 --> 00:04:40.999
Others might not be as explicit,

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:43.442
once you go into organic chemistry

00:04:43.442 --> 00:04:47.523
chains of carbons are just
done, they're just ...

00:04:47.523 --> 00:04:50.251
You might see something
like this for benzene,

00:04:50.251 --> 00:04:54.941
where the carbons are implicit
as the vertex of each,

00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.415
there's an implicit carbon
at each of these vertices,

00:04:57.415 --> 00:04:59.714
and then you say, OK, carbon's gotta have,

00:04:59.714 --> 00:05:01.757
not gotta, but it's
typically going to have

00:05:01.757 --> 00:05:05.473
four bonds in its stable state,
I only see one, two, three.

00:05:05.473 --> 00:05:07.887
Well, if it's not drawn,
then it must be a hydrogen.

00:05:07.887 --> 00:05:09.460
That's actually the convention that people

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.864
use in organic chemistry.

00:05:10.864 --> 00:05:13.978
So there's multiple ways
to do a structural formula,

00:05:13.978 --> 00:05:16.741
but this is a very typical
one right over here.

00:05:16.741 --> 00:05:18.421
As you see, I'm just getting more and more

00:05:18.421 --> 00:05:20.659
and more information
as I go from empirical

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:23.653
to molecular to structural formula.

00:05:23.653 --> 00:05:25.940
Now, I want to make clear, that empirical

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.133
formulas and molecular formulas
aren't always different

00:05:29.133 --> 00:05:33.522
if the ratios are actually, also show the

00:05:33.522 --> 00:05:36.138
actual number of each of those elements

00:05:36.138 --> 00:05:37.437
that you have in a molecule.

00:05:37.437 --> 00:05:41.509
A good example of that would be water.

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:43.780
Let me do water.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.416
Let me do this in a
different color that I,

00:05:45.416 --> 00:05:48.794
well, I've pretty much
already used every color.

00:05:48.794 --> 00:05:50.280
Water.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.194
So water we all know,
for every two hydrogens,

00:05:54.194 --> 00:05:56.794
for every two hydrogens, and since I

00:05:56.794 --> 00:05:58.806
already decided to use
blue for hydrogen let me

00:05:58.806 --> 00:06:00.687
use blue again for hydrogen,

00:06:00.687 --> 00:06:05.075
for every two hydrogens
you have an oxygen.

00:06:05.075 --> 00:06:06.863
You have an oxygen.

00:06:06.863 --> 00:06:09.958
It just so happens to be,
what I just wrote down

00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.942
I kind of thought of in
terms of empirical formula,

00:06:11.942 --> 00:06:14.335
in terms of ratios, but
that's actually the case.

00:06:14.335 --> 00:06:18.038
A molecule of hydrogen,
sorry, a molecule of water

00:06:18.038 --> 00:06:21.833
has exactly two hydrogens and,

00:06:21.833 --> 00:06:23.934
and one oxygen.

00:06:23.934 --> 00:06:25.745
If you want to see the structural formula,

00:06:25.745 --> 00:06:27.221
you're probably familiar with it or you

00:06:27.221 --> 00:06:28.660
might be familiar with it.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:33.501
Each of those oxygens in a water molecule

00:06:33.501 --> 00:06:36.171
are bonded to two hydrogens,

00:06:36.171 --> 00:06:38.910
are bonded to two hydrogens.

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:42.011
So hopefully this at least begins to

00:06:42.011 --> 00:06:44.906
appreciate different ways of referring to

00:06:44.906 --> 00:06:48.906
or representing a molecule.
