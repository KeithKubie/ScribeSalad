RACHEL: My name is
Rachel K. I work

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.610
in our centralized training
function here at Google,

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.040
and it is my honor to introduce
to you Professor Stuart

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.950
Diamond, who is the
author of "Getting More:

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.960
How to Negotiate to Achieve
your Goals in the Real World."

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.500
This book has just very
recently been published

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.940
and is already off to
incredible critical acclaim.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.200
It has been named number one
on the "Wall Street Journal's"

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.960
blog as the best business
book and the number one book

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.090
to buy in this year.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.420
It is the number one
on the "USA Today."

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.920
And next week, we'll see that
it's number five on the "New

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.120
York Times" Best Seller List.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.460
So it's really a pleasure to
have Professor Diamond here.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.120
I would love to run through
all of his accomplishments,

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.740
but then you wouldn't
hear from him.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.160
So I'll just give
you a few highlights.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.200
He has a law degree from
Harvard and an MBA from Wharton.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.050
He teaches Wharton's
most popular course,

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.870
in the negotiations that
this book is based upon.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.570
And he has experience
in academia.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.550
He's taught at Columbia, at NYU,
Berkeley, Harvard, and more.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.770
And he has experience
in the real world.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.760
The reason that this stuff works
is that he uses it every day.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.150
And as the President
of the Global Strategy

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.590
Group, his business,
Professor Diamond

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.470
helps many other
clients around the world

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.990
achieve what they need
through his techniques.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.690
A few quick highlights.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.120
It was Professor Diamond's
tips and techniques

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.900
that helped end the
writer's strike in 2008

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.270
in Hollywood that many of you
in this country will remember.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.970
He's also the CEO of an
airline in St. Thomas.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.720
And he's the Pulitzer
Prize-winning journalist

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.710
of the "New York Times."

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.340
So yeah, he's covered
all the bases.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.250
But on a more personal note,
this course, this content,

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.700
has actually changed my life.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.970
I had the privilege
of taking his course,

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.500
semester-long course, and have
been working with Professor

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.970
Diamond here for over
three years as he

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.290
brings this material
to Googlers and watch

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.280
them use it every day.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.720
But I have to say that the
thing that is most striking

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.480
is how Googly he is.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.120
Professor Diamond is very
intent on respecting others,

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.710
growing the pie rather
than cheating others out

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.830
of their fair share in order to
get what is best for everyone.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.250
He respects and
admires diversity

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.590
and looks to surround himself
with that in everything

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:37.590
that he does.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.800
And fairness and collaboration
are a central thread

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.490
to all of his business efforts.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.130
So with that, I'd
like to turn it over

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.520
to Professor Stuart Diamond.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.880
Thank you so much for
being with us today.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.704
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:54.704 --> 00:02:56.370
STUART DIAMOND: Thank
you all very much.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.930
It's an honor to be here.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.570
I want to talk to
you about something

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.950
today that you do all the time.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.380
Every single interaction
you have in your life

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.080
involves negotiation.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.520
Whether talking to your
friends, walking down the street

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.900
and passing
somebody, negotiating

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.580
for a job in business, and
everything else that you do.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.010
And most of the
instructions that you

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.430
have been given about
those interactions

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.450
since you were little are wrong.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.550
Which is to say that they don't
meet your goals very well.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.800
And that is true, not
just in daily life,

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.280
but in diplomacy, in business,
and in everything we do.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.420
The climate that
results from following

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.300
a series of wrong
instructions supports

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.490
what happened in Tucson,
supports Congress

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.430
pushing through and then
repealing, trying to repeal,

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.710
the health care law.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:00.450
And folks, all the controversies
that we have in the world

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.110
come from the
wrong instructions.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.000
And so what "Getting
More" provides

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.530
is a new and different
method of human interaction.

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.280
One that will be
familiar to you,

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.900
and that I'm sure
you support, but one

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.380
within the page of "Getting
More" lays out in a structure

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.350
that you can replicate
in everything you do.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.240
And this new form of human
interact-- its different way

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.710
of thinking says that
perceptions and emotions

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.850
are more important
than power and logic.

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.570
That the pictures in the
heads of the other party

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.470
is more important than any
collection of facts, evidence,

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.100
or resources that you
can possibly muster.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.000
That making a connection
with another person

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.500
is the most persuasive
thing that you do.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:02.330
And that force, power,
win-win, my way or the highway,

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.400
BATNA, good cop/bad
cop, walking out,

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.790
generally do more
harm than good.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:15.650
In addition to that,
they get only about 25%

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.960
of the value of doing it
a different way, which

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.330
is something I'll talk
about in a few moments.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.390
And of course, the focus
on people and relationships

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.330
does not mean you
have to be a patsy.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.760
This is a very strong way of
negotiating and protecting

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.900
yourself, but it's a way
that protects yourself

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.450
in a humane and ethical way.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:49.220
And so I wanted to talk just a
little bit about this process.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.540
And then, I'll entertain
some questions.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.620
In addition to being
something you do every day,

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.510
it's hard to find this
stuff because it's

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.280
buried in ordinary language.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.750
In fact, the different
between success and failure

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.120
is very, very small.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.940
I like to use a
baseball analogy.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.320
If you are a .280
hitter in baseball

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.370
and you get 1 extra
hit every 9 games,

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.040
you become a .310
hitter in baseball.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.980
And that's worth
two things to you.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.290
One, a place in
the Hall of Fame.

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:25.650
And two, $10
million more a year.

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.720
And so you can't
find these tools.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.720
They're mostly invisible,
unless you already know them.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.920
And let me give you
a couple of examples.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.550
One from another
company, one from Google,

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.300
to show you what I mean.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.360
I had student, a former
student who works at Exxon.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.190
Flew up to Philadelphia
a couple of weeks

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.750
ago on a Southwest
Airlines plane.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.610
Plane was four hours late.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.100
The rest of the
passengers were snarling

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:58.100
at the flight attendants and
all the other airline personnel.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.330
And this former student of
mine thought about the pictures

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.620
in the heads of
the other parties.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.170
He went up to the
flight attendants

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:07.830
and the other airline personnel.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:11.190
He apologized for
everybody else's behavior

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:14.080
and he commiserated them
that their workday was

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.990
going to be four hours longer.

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:22.100
And when he got off the
plane, they gave him $600.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.370
The only one on
the plane for that

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:28.010
to happen to because
he understood

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:32.020
that it was about them,
not him, that he needed

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.770
to make the connection with.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:39.940
And he needed to step out of
the emotion of the moment.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:43.720
And it's invisible unless you
already know how to do that.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:48.180
I had a student at Google
here, Francoise [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.430
I don't know if
Francoise is here today.

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:56.080
Francoise is still one of the
heads of network administration

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.570
here and network sales.

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:02.990
And he was in Southeast Asia
doing a deal with a client.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:06.180
And the client couldn't
afford Google's pricing,

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.440
couldn't do the deal.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.990
And so Francoise probed
a lot more deeply

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:14.470
into what this other party
was about in the deal,

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:18.620
outside the deal, what are your
hopes and dreams, who are you

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:22.270
as a person, and found out
that the client was having

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:25.840
a lot of trouble financing
another venture that

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.870
had nothing to do with Google.

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:33.750
And the client also had a whole
bunch of fiber optic cable that

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:35.750
had been sitting
around for a while

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:38.340
that it really could
use the cash flow for

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:40.960
and really didn't
care if it got rid of.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:44.010
And so Francois went to the
senior management of Google

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:48.520
and got a loan for this
company at favorable rates

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.860
to finance its other venture.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:54.410
And in return,
got a 96% discount

00:08:54.410 --> 00:09:01.085
on the fiber optic cable,
saving Google $500 million.

00:09:01.085 --> 00:09:04.570
That is also invisible.

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:08.880
The notion of making a
connection with them,

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.900
no matter what the deal
is, and finding something

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.740
to get more with.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:19.820
Now, you don't have to devote
your life to negotiation

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:20.840
actively.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:25.260
But the more you know about
what's going on around you,

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.230
the more you can make
critical interventions.

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:32.800
And so my students learn the
exquisitely more conscious

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.510
of the world around them.

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:35.395
A simple analogy.

00:09:35.395 --> 00:09:39.690
There's an old maxim about
the difference between expert

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:41.370
and non-expert knowledge.

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:45.290
A non-expert looks at a
field and sees flat land.

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.580
An expert looks
at the same field

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.080
and begins to see little
peaks and valleys,

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.630
little bits of relief.

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:55.520
It takes no more time
or energy for the expert

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.010
to collect the greater
amount of information

00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:00.460
from that landscape
than the non-expert,

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:03.990
but the expert can make much
better use of that information

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:07.240
to pursue opportunities
or minimize risks.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:10.770
So what we're talking about
is getting you to be much more

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:15.620
conscious about the topography
of your life and what's around

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:20.150
you, because let's face it,
you cannot avoid negotiations.

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:23.560
They hit you in the face,
whether you like it or not.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:26.620
You can do them well or badly.

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:29.290
Saying, I avoid
negotiations means

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:32.030
you stand on the sidelines
and they get to score

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:33.960
touchdowns all day long.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:37.480
And so you have to decide
how much to use it.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:41.300
But once again, once you
have it in your arsenal,

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:44.330
you always see it.

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:47.580
But before, it's invisible.

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:50.890
And so what I want to
do-- before I show you

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:57.410
the specific tool,
I have a little menu

00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:01.460
of people and companies that
have benefited from this.

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:05.210
I had three women, the last one
here in my class from India,

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:08.310
who could have their own
arranged marriages in India

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:11.600
using course tools with
their parents' blessing

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.010
after the invitations had
been sent out and daddy paid

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:18.720
for the wedding with somebody
from a different sect, which

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.980
is almost unheard of.

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:23.500
Of course, four-year-old--
brush his teeth, goes to bed.

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.110
No problema.

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:28.010
And we'll talk about
that a little bit, too.

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:30.950
And so these things
are meant to be used

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:33.970
in any kind of a situation.

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:37.390
I had somebody named [? Mahul ?]
[? Trivedi ?] who was a student

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:38.520
of mine at Wharton.

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:41.170
And he took my course
because he got dinged,

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:43.630
rejected by 18 companies.

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:46.020
So he came to see me
before the course began.

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:47.800
And I said, fine,
we're going to get you

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.650
offers from the same companies.

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:52.620
And he said, Professor Diamond,
with respect, you're crazy.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.160
And I said, well, let's see.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.890
And so I told him,
what I want you to do

00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:02.000
is not send the same
resume to each firm.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.180
I want you to write 18 different
resumes, each one catering

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:11.810
to the pictures and the heads
of the department that you're

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:13.910
interviewing with,
and the people who

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:14.870
are interviewing you.

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:18.060
What are their
hopes, dreams, fears?

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:19.430
Talk to alumni.

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:21.040
Talk to former employees.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.300
Ask HR.

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:25.820
Ask the people themselves as
you do repeated interviews.

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:29.870
Well, he gave up after
12 final interviews,

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:31.930
a fistful of job offers.

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:34.570
And he just took one and
says, the rest is obvious.

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:35.940
I'll get the other six.

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.580
OK.

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:41.430
So again, pretty invisible.

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:45.820
But again, focused on the
model that I've talked about.

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:49.980
So this is a comment by
one of my former students

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:51.480
from Microsoft.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:56.830
And this is a comment from
Patrick Grandinetti at Google

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:57.970
from taking the course.

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:02.770
About, I guess, 300 people or
so have taken the course here,

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:06.790
and they have benefited widely.

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:07.550
OK.

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:12.760
Well, let me talk about
the four different levels

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.220
of negotiation.

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:18.580
And to tell you what's wrong
and what we can do about it.

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:21.380
The first level, the
traditional level,

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:24.610
is getting people to do
what you will them to do.

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:29.010
Threats, leverage, power,
my way or the highway,

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:32.140
take it or leave it, BATNA
alternatives to agreement,

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.190
walking out, et cetera.

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:37.390
The problem is not
that it doesn't work.

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:39.885
It works with $20 trillion.

00:13:39.885 --> 00:13:41.550
The United States
can do whatever

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:43.060
it wants in the Middle East.

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:46.940
The problem is it's
really expensive.

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:48.850
It takes a long time.

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:50.870
And it's not self-enforcing.

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:54.250
In addition to that,
it tends to cause

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:58.900
retaliation and resentment.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:02.630
And that means the kids kicking
and screaming on the floor,

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:06.490
malicious obedience at work, or
terrorists in the Middle East.

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:09.610
It's not a real happy situation.

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:12.300
And if you think
that BATNA, Best

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.940
Alternative To A Negotiated
Agreement, works.

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:16.930
The next time
you're out to dinner

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:20.380
with your spouse or significant
other, in the middle of dinner

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:22.380
pull out your little
black book and say,

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:24.530
you know, if this
doesn't work out,

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:27.240
I got these whole bunch
of alternatives here.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.240
See what happens.

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:36.500
So that also tends
to piss people off.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:43.160
But this is the tool of choice
in work, at play, in the world.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:47.220
The United States could have
sanctions on Korea and Iran

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:50.840
like it has with Cuba
until the end of time.

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:54.880
All it's doing is promoting
what I call the Alamo strategy.

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:58.360
They will fight to
the last man standing.

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:01.200
And so that's the problem.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:06.160
And it's not a way to approach
negotiations effectively.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:11.640
It gets about 25% of
the value of what you

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.850
can get by the model I propose.

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:17.090
And as evidence
of that, I'd like

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:20.630
to call your attention to the
work of John Nash, a Princeton

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:24.280
mathematician who won a Nobel
Prize for a bunch of theories,

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.560
including this work.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:28.860
Was played by Russell Crowe in
the movie "A Beautiful Mind."

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:33.140
What Nash did is he
proves mathematically

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:37.020
the 1755 theorem of
Swiss philosopher

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:38.840
Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:43.110
And what Rousseau hypothesized
is when parties collaborate,

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:47.440
the overall size of the pie
expands to such an extent

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:51.330
that each party gets much
more than it could get alone

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:56.170
with a smaller pie, no matter
how big that smaller pie is

00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:59.500
and how much of that
smaller pie the person got.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.480
And the really good
example that he

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:05.310
used is four
hunters individually

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:07.040
could only get a rabbit.

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.410
Together, they can
bring down a deer.

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:13.400
And that's a different way
of thinking [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:17.100
You think that the
Congress, the Democrats,

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.460
forced a health plan down
the Republicans' throat.

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:22.270
Then, the Republicans
got in office,

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:25.790
and they're trying to repeal
as much of it as they can.

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:30.190
Would you say that's consistent
or inconsistent with what

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:31.320
I've just said?

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:36.230
The result is we're not getting
a very good health plan.

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:40.990
And so that's the problem
with that attitude.

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:45.560
So let's go-- and these are
examples of how people act.

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:50.410
The people on the left
get four times as much

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:51.980
as the people on the right.

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:55.050
They get twice as many
deals, and each deal

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:56.480
gets twice as much.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:00.300
Now, if you're a hard bargainer
and you do the one on the right

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:02.860
and you say, well,
I'm doing just fine.

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:05.380
And that's what, until
now, hard bargainers

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:06.520
have been able to say.

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:09.579
Of course, they didn't
have the comparison

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:11.160
to the column on the left.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.030
They were in a vacuum.

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:16.000
But now, there is a comparison.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:22.359
I've taught 30,000 people in
45 countries over the last 20

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:23.220
years.

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:27.150
I've read more than a thousand
studies, half a million

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:29.980
pages of journals and
research material.

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:33.990
And it wasn't until
1998 that I began

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:37.770
to see that people weren't
meeting their goals very well.

00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:41.640
And over the last
dozen years, I began

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:45.930
to develop this based upon what
happened in the real world,

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:48.570
including my own ventures.

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:49.240
OK.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:54.910
Power also is unstable
and unpredictable.

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:56.060
This in the Middle East.

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:58.627
People don't like when I mention
what the nationalities are.

00:17:58.627 --> 00:17:59.960
Although, you can figure it out.

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:04.870
But this tank is not about
to run over this little boy.

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:06.970
Not with the whole
world watching.

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:11.000
So you might lose your
power in an instant.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.970
You might appear extreme if
you use your power too much.

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:23.870
The way to use power is to use
just enough to meet your goals.

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:28.740
And the other person
shouldn't be able to feel it.

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:32.590
That's the way one
should look at this.

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:34.800
Let's go to the next level.

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.790
This is what people have
done, the cognoscenti,

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:42.610
for the last 30 years-- win-win,
interest-based negotiation,

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:46.210
rational actors, et cetera.

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:47.420
That's better.

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:50.140
People see a rational
benefit to them

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:52.860
and they're willing
to go along with it.

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:56.610
And that works with
really rational people

00:18:56.610 --> 00:19:00.290
with no emotions, sitting
with their spreadsheets

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:01.700
in a conference room.

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:05.110
Everybody is really calm.

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:08.220
That doesn't work very often.

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:13.740
And so it's either irrelevant or
not reflective of what goes on.

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:18.220
We live in an irrational,
emotional world.

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:22.900
And the more important the
negotiation is to the parties,

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:25.370
the more irrational they are.

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:29.290
And that means world peace, a
billion-dollar deal, or my kid

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:30.860
wants an ice cream cone.

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:33.450
And so therefore,
you've got to take

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:37.030
people's emotional temperature
and deal with their emotions.

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:41.800
If the local school board or
municipality has raised taxes,

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.510
I don't want to
know from win-win.

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:46.890
I want to know how you're
going to make my life better.

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:50.080
I want an emotional
payment-- empathy,

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.370
I understand, some compassion.

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:54.320
Some way to make me feel better.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:58.960
The right answer to the
statement "I hate you"

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.940
is "tell me more."

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:03.940
Because you're
obviously exercised,

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:07.460
and you're not listening
if you're exercised.

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:10.120
I need to get you
to listen to me.

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:14.250
These are really
powerful tools to use

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:15.590
when people are emotional.

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:19.060
Not telling them to calm
down, but listening to what

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:21.910
they have to say, whether
they're crazy or not.

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:25.540
It is obvious that the
president of North Korea

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:28.160
mostly wants love.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:31.430
He wants to join the
trade committees.

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:33.550
He wants people to respect him.

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:35.680
Every time some
American shows up,

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:37.070
he rolls out the red carpet.

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:38.490
He releases prisoners.

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:40.270
He talks to the South.

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:43.350
He's like Danny DeVito in that
movie with the beautiful woman,

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:44.320
"Other People's Money."

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:47.300
He gets himself all
gussied up and ready.

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:49.790
Don't we get it?

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:51.600
So these are emotional payments.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:56.130
I once told my class at Wharton
that I tell my wife sometimes

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:58.760
that she's right
even when she's not

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:00.940
to preserve marital harmony.

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:04.910
And then I thought, well, that's
not fair to keep it from her.

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:06.810
So I went home and
I said to my wife,

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:09.640
you know, honey, I
told my class today

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.800
that I tell you sometimes
that you're right

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:14.430
even if you're wrong.

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:15.830
And you know what she said?

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:17.478
That will work.

00:21:17.478 --> 00:21:19.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:23.600
So people want
emotional payments.

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:27.190
And that's the first thing you
need to do in negotiations.

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:30.890
And so it brings us to the
third and fourth levels,

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:34.720
to perceive what you want
them to perceive and to feel

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.320
what you want them to feel.

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:37.980
Almost nobody goes there.

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:40.550
And I think the story
of the writers' strike

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:42.340
will prove instructive here.

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:44.990
I was called about
three years ago

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:49.350
by Ari Emanuel, who's the
leading agent in Hollywood,

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:52.240
the role model for "Entourage"
and the brother of Rahm,

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:54.000
who was the White
House Chief of Staff,

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.990
to help them with
the writers' strike.

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:58.200
The writers had been on
strike for three months.

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.350
They'd been without a
contract for a year.

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:02.190
No new TV material.

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:03.950
Nobody was talking to anybody.

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:07.230
They had finally
scheduled a breakfast

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:09.786
with the studio reps for
that Thursday morning.

00:22:09.786 --> 00:22:10.910
It was a Tuesday afternoon.

00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:13.484
So I got on the phone with
the Writers Guild people

00:22:13.484 --> 00:22:14.650
and a bunch of other people.

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:17.660
And they wanted to know what
the priority of the [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:20.300
issues are, what the
royalty rate should be,

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:21.940
and other contractual issues.

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:24.150
And I said, forget
all that stuff.

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:28.050
Go to the breakfast and ask the
people from the studios three

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:29.230
questions.

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:32.710
Question number
one, are you happy?

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:34.200
We're not happy.

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:37.470
Question number two,
are you making money?

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:39.420
We're not making any money.

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:42.880
Question number three, if you
had to do this over again,

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.150
how would you guys do it?

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:48.660
It took 30 minutes to
restart the negotiations.

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:51.640
It took two days to
get an agreement.

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:55.850
Now, there's two things I
can say for sure about this.

00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:58.620
One, it's not rocket science.

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:02.370
And two, unless you
already know how to do it,

00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:05.490
it's completely invisible.

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:07.420
And so that's what
we're talking about,

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:11.500
is learning this stuff that's
invisible to the other party.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:14.480
Things like, are my
actions meeting my goals?

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:16.880
Of course they have
problems in the Middle East,

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:19.260
because the wrong
people are negotiating.

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:21.312
People that are emotional.

00:23:21.312 --> 00:23:23.520
You know, they already have
peace in the Middle East.

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:27.450
600,000 Palestinians and
Israelis live together.

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:29.620
They should be negotiating.

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:32.870
And so those are the kind
of things that come up.

00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:36.940
This is the model based
upon a lot of research

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:39.680
that supports what I've
been talking about.

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:44.260
And this has particular
relevance to Googlers.

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:45.990
And when I mention
this, it would

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:48.120
take some getting used to.

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:50.250
Because it's very
different from,

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:52.970
probably, the model that
you've seen in your own

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:56.170
heads in terms of
Google's success.

00:23:56.170 --> 00:24:00.890
Less than 10% of the reason
why people reach agreements

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:05.830
has anything to do with the
facts and the substance.

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:10.400
Has almost nothing to do with
how good your engineering is,

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.860
with the substantive
knowledge you have.

00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:19.020
More than 50% has to do with
whether the people like you

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:20.090
or not.

00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:25.060
And almost 40% has to do
with the process you use.

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:26.550
Do you deal with emotions?

00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:27.650
Do you get commitments?

00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:28.490
Et cetera.

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:34.910
And if you think this top blue
triangle is the negotiation,

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:38.362
sadly you're going to be right
more than you're persuasive.

00:24:38.362 --> 00:24:43.340
This is very hard for people who
are [INAUDIBLE] based to grasp,

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:46.960
but it's absolutely true
based upon a ton of research.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:50.840
Why was OJ Simpson
found not guilty

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:56.330
by the first jury in Los Angeles
despite a yard of DNA evidence,

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:57.800
including his blood at the site?

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:01.560
It's because the jury,
the inner-city jury,

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:04.050
didn't like or trust
the prosecutor.

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:06.750
And if they don't like you
and they don't trust you,

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:08.710
they won't hear you.

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:12.800
Now, Google has been
wildly successful because

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:15.100
of this blue triangle up here.

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:20.640
That you have so-- you're
so far ahead of the pack

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.820
that you have done great.

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:28.440
I read this treatise in business
school called "The Myth of US

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.150
Industrial Supremacy."

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:32.860
And there's a line in
there that stuck with me.

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:37.640
It said, "There is no human
enterprise, organization,

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:43.890
or civilization that cannot,
given enough time, be ruined."

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:48.650
And so what I'm thinking
about is it's fantastic,

00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:51.930
but it doesn't last forever.

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:54.420
That additional
skills are needed.

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:57.350
I gave a presentation
at Microsoft

00:25:57.350 --> 00:26:01.540
about four or five years ago
to the business development

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:02.910
and legal department.

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:07.010
And the first thing I did was
that I told the 300 people

00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:10.720
there that I had
Googled Microsoft.

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:15.650
And that I had typed in three
words, Europe hates Microsoft.

00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:19.790
And I said, why did
I get 5 million hits

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:22.020
in a tenth of a second?

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:25.780
I said, you think
that costs you money?

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:27.920
You think the fact
that people don't

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:31.770
like you means they
won't buy your products,

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:37.640
even if it's the best on the
market for their application?

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:40.250
And so this is
something that one needs

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:42.460
to pay a lot of attention to.

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:45.530
Which means that
the characteristics

00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:49.860
and sensibilities of the person
sitting across from you so

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:53.290
dwarfs every other part
of the negotiation,

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:56.070
it's neither worth talking
about race, religion, gender,

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:59.960
culture, creed, unless you know
who's sitting across from you.

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:03.580
If you bring three people
to a negotiation on Monday

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:06.900
and so do they, and you bring
a fourth person on Tuesday,

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:10.080
it's a completely
different negotiation.

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:13.910
Even with the same six people,
somebody's kid might be sick.

00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:15.630
Some may have had a bad commute.

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:17.690
So the first thing
I've got to do

00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:20.700
is take the
emotional temperature

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:23.500
of the person sitting
across from me, even if,

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:26.720
and perhaps especially,
if I'm married to them.

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:29.370
There is no Google
way to negotiate.

00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:31.780
There is no American
way to negotiate.

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:36.830
There are just individuals and
the pictures in their heads.

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:41.280
I've had the opportunity to
read the titles of all 2,200

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:44.170
negotiation books
written since 1950

00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:46.075
as well as 400 or
500 books themselves.

00:27:46.075 --> 00:27:48.420
And I found some doozies.

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:50.090
Here's one of my favorites.

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:53.470
"How to Negotiate
with the Japanese."

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:55.060
What's wrong with that?

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:55.650
What?

00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:58.100
You're negotiating with
130 million Japanese?

00:27:58.100 --> 00:27:59.530
How interesting.

00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:02.800
You're negotiating with
a person or a couple

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:06.950
of people who may be
more or less the same

00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:08.800
as the cultural norm.

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:11.460
So I want to figure
out, what are

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:13.060
the pictures in their heads?

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:19.550
A more dramatic example, if you
were a Jew in Poland in 1944

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:23.100
and you thought the
Nazis were monolithic

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:26.970
and you met Oskar Schindler,
you lost your life

00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:31.430
because you didn't realize that
Schindler, although a Nazi,

00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:33.000
was willing to save your life.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.110
But you never asked him, because
you thought all Nazis hated

00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:36.690
Jews.

00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:40.770
What a source of
competitive advantage

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:44.110
it is to know who
is really the same

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:45.930
and who's really different.

00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:51.586
And so that is a tremendous
competitive advantage for you.

00:28:51.586 --> 00:28:54.850
You may have more in
common with somebody

00:28:54.850 --> 00:29:00.210
who is your sworn archenemy
than you do with somebody

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:03.520
who sits next to you
at Google, if you just

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:06.660
took the time to find out.

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:11.000
Once you do that, you
then have to figure out

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.280
whether your perceptions match.

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:16.690
And if they don't, what
do you do about it?

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:21.120
And I put this up in my
classroom when I teach.

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:23.880
And I point to the
red dot and I say

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:27.120
to people, OK, what do you see?

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:28.430
Two words or less.

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:31.690
And I get these answers
and hundreds more.

00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:38.690
I get vast disagreement about
what saw from a simple picture.

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:41.100
Only less than
half of the answers

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:43.916
contain the word red in it.

00:29:43.916 --> 00:29:46.600
And in addition to
that, most people

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:50.300
process a small amount of
the available information.

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:54.270
Clearly, there is more
white space than red dot.

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:58.370
And so what you think
is the perception

00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:01.210
doesn't mean that they
think it's the perception.

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:04.380
And for example, we did a
role reversal-- and this

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:08.520
is in the book-- at Google
with one of the attorneys.

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.720
I had him play a salesperson.

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.240
He played a salesperson
for five minutes.

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:16.170
And he said, you
know, I was amazed

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:20.350
after five minutes at how much
I hated lawyers at Google.

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:24.750
And so because there are
different perceptions

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:29.700
that you have to find out
based upon the different ways

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:33.290
that people have been brought
up, on influences on them,

00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:35.420
and you need to find out.

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:38.460
So every time you have a
disagreement with somebody,

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:42.690
you need to check your
perceptions and theirs.

00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:45.870
This is even a much more
serious problem than that.

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:47.890
I'm sure you've all
seen this picture.

00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:51.180
I'm not going to go through
the details of it for time.

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:52.710
But if you want to
ask me, you can.

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:55.090
There are two woman in
this picture, a young woman

00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:57.582
to the left of the
picture and an old woman,

00:30:57.582 --> 00:30:59.040
which is sort of
the whole picture.

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:01.270
One's mouth is the
other's necklace.

00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:04.550
One nose is the other's
chin, and so forth.

00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:09.430
I've given half of this picture
to a class, the young woman,

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:12.510
and the old woman to the
other half of a class.

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:15.390
And I've asked them to stare
at their half for five minutes

00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:17.460
while I took this
off the screen.

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:22.390
Then, I put the combined
picture back on the screen.

00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:24.800
What do you think happened?

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:29.350
Well, almost nobody
could see the other one.

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:33.500
So the question is, if
people have trouble seeing

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:37.600
an image they know is there
after seeing a contrary

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:41.780
image for five minutes, how
much trouble does one culture

00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:44.250
have seeing other culture's
point of view that

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:48.130
have seen the same picture
for a thousand years?

00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:50.870
And when I say "culture,"
I mean production

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:56.410
versus marketing, legal versus
sales, Mets versus Phillies.

00:31:56.410 --> 00:31:59.520
I don't just mean
Arabs and Jews.

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:03.240
So this issue is
much more serious.

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:04.920
They're not being stubborn.

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:06.640
They're not being recalcitrant.

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.180
They're not being stupid.

00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:14.150
What you see so clearly is
not there for them at all.

00:32:14.150 --> 00:32:16.200
It doesn't exist.

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:20.860
And so you've got to
start at the beginning.

00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:23.810
What are the pictures
in their heads?

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:27.550
And what I think is black
they may think is white.

00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:32.070
And you've got to find
out, friend or foe,

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:37.560
or you don't have a prayer to
persuade them willingly, only

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:40.430
by force.

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:43.650
And there are some things in
the book that talk about this.

00:32:43.650 --> 00:32:46.590
The next point I want to make,
which is related to this,

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:49.960
should resonate
with you very much.

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:52.410
There's two studies I
want to commend to you.

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:54.530
They're both in the
book to think about.

00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:58.800
The first study said that
work groups in which there

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:01.720
are varying perceptions,
where people disagree

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:06.220
with each other, produce three
times as many marketable ideas

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:08.170
than consensus groups.

00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:11.540
The second study shows--
it's a study of US cities--

00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:16.310
that for each 10% of
diversity added to an area,

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:20.970
net income of people
in it goes up 15%.

00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:23.390
That is an enormous figure.

00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:27.440
It is no magic
that Silicon Valley

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:29.940
is outside of San
Francisco, which

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:33.120
is the most diverse city
in the United States,

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:36.200
and has been the quickest
major city to come back

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:38.350
from the recession.

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:42.360
So you stand for diversity.

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:45.190
If somebody says to you
with some frustration

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:47.820
that you disagree with each
other, you've got to say,

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:48.710
that's great.

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:50.520
We're going to make money.

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:51.680
Homogeneity?

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:52.830
Not profitable.

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:54.040
Difference is profitable.

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:55.660
Let's disagree with
each other some

00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:58.110
more so we can make some money.

00:33:58.110 --> 00:34:03.220
So I want to turn the
paradigm on its head and value

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:04.710
differences.

00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:08.030
And from that, get creativity.

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:10.199
So how do they value things?

00:34:10.199 --> 00:34:12.810
Do they value things
different from you?

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:17.300
Somebody at Google that I taught
who couldn't get a client.

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:19.389
He found out about the client.

00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:20.500
The client's life.

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:22.630
Found out the client
had a daughter

00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:24.310
was having computer problems.

00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:25.429
High school-age daughter.

00:34:25.429 --> 00:34:28.699
The guy from Google took
his own time, went over

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:31.010
the guy's house for
a Saturday morning,

00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:33.520
tutored the daughter,
fixed the computer,

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:35.880
got a multimillion-dollar
account.

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:39.050
And so that's trading
items of unequal value--

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:41.790
time for a
multimillion-dollar account.

00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:45.860
The client thinks, here is
somebody who cares about me.

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:49.550
As long as you deal--
and this is also

00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:52.380
different from
interest-based negotiation,

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:57.400
because it uses all of the
synapses in each party's head.

00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.940
The CEO of a major
company in Philadelphia

00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:03.020
once told me, the most
important thing he ever

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:07.130
did for his major client in a
20-year business relationship

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:09.970
was to pick up the client
CEO's mother-in-law

00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:12.570
at the Philadelphia
Airport one Saturday night.

00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:14.980
It has nothing to
do with any deal,

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:17.020
but it affects every deal.

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:19.270
Had another Googler
in one of my classes

00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:23.820
here who a vendor raised prices
on him to a significant extent.

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:26.460
And so he thought about the
pictures in the vendor's head

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:30.070
and realized it's
very hard for vendors

00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:33.280
to get into big
companies like Google.

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:36.400
And so he said to the
vendor, I'll tell you what.

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:40.810
You hold the price and I will
provide you introductions

00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:42.590
to other departments at Google.

00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:45.780
What you do after
that is your concern.

00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:47.020
You get the job.

00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:48.260
You don't get the job.

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:50.700
But I'm going to provide
you the opportunity.

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:55.340
For the provision of
the opportunity alone,

00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:57.460
the vendor held the price.

00:35:57.460 --> 00:36:00.250
And so that's what I mean
about a different way

00:36:00.250 --> 00:36:04.180
of thinking about how people
interact with each other.

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:06.650
I do want to talk for
a minute about kids.

00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:09.470
This is my eight-year-old
son, Alexander.

00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:12.130
My favorite negotiating
partner, soon

00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:15.120
to be my costar on YouTube.

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:18.220
But I want to mention
something about kids.

00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:24.200
Kids are very negotiable if you
learn the language of children.

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:25.850
A couple of examples.

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:27.860
Kids have little power.

00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:29.250
They want power.

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:32.710
And so give them
stuff proactively.

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:35.890
I tell Alexander he can
pick the restaurants.

00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:37.590
His room can be a little messy.

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:39.270
He can go to bed a
little bit later.

00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:43.110
And so as a result of that,
Alexander is constantly

00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:44.960
in a debtor position with me.

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:47.730
He always owes me stuff.

00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:53.340
And so when I ask him to do
things, he does them for me.

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:56.680
Also, I tend to
respect Alexander.

00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:57.960
I come home from work.

00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:59.610
He's watching TV again.

00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:01.390
I don't shut off the TV.

00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:04.310
I think to myself, well,
sometimes I come home,

00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:05.270
I'm stressed out.

00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:06.360
I have a drink.

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:08.990
Maybe the kid's stressed
out from elementary school.

00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:10.660
I mean, kids get stressed out.

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:12.850
So I want to have a
conversation about it.

00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:14.290
How is your stress level?

00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:16.320
You watch TV to relieve stress.

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:20.430
Even if that's not the reason,
he respects the question.

00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:22.550
And we'll have a
better relationship.

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:27.010
The third thing is kids
are very incremental.

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:28.890
So you want to be incremental.

00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:30.040
You won't clean your room?

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:32.630
Will you clean a
quarter of your room?

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:35.630
Will you clean a
half of your room?

00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:40.050
A couple of months ago, my kid
wouldn't do his math homework.

00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:41.660
It was 7:30 at night.

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:43.450
My wife said, do
your homework now.

00:37:43.450 --> 00:37:45.160
He said, how about 8:30?

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:46.540
My wife went ballistic.

00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:49.730
I said to Alexander,
how about 7:33?

00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:51.560
He said, OK.

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:53.560
My wife said, what?

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:57.005
And the thing was
kids are incremental.

00:37:57.005 --> 00:37:58.560
Can I have a cookie?

00:37:58.560 --> 00:37:59.685
Can I have a half a cookie?

00:37:59.685 --> 00:38:01.970
Can I have a
quarter of a cookie?

00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:04.700
And so what I was trying
to say to Alexander

00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:07.500
is I speak your language.

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:13.440
And in return for that, he
gave me a 57-minute concession.

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:16.220
And so those are ways
to deal with kids.

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:19.680
There's a chapter in
the book about kids.

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:24.100
I want to mention not to walk
out of negotiations unless it's

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:25.480
a mutual agreement.

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:27.950
Because the signal to
the other party is,

00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:30.440
I don't even care
enough about you

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:32.940
to give you the time of day.

00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:35.700
It's a bad signal.

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:38.180
The last major point I
want to make to you--

00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:39.940
and there's more
of it in the book.

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:42.030
And I'd like to
commend it to you,

00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:45.840
is to deal with hard
bargainers in particular,

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:47.970
learn their standards.

00:38:47.970 --> 00:38:50.310
Learn how they make decisions.

00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:52.440
What are their policies?

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:54.790
Quote their stated policies.

00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:58.210
If their website says they
care about their customers,

00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:01.190
and they're late delivering
your cable TV box

00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:03.060
or they overcharge
you on the phone,

00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:05.320
you want to say to the
customer service rep, well,

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:07.690
I read on your
website that customers

00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:09.880
are the most important
part of your business.

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:11.910
How does that dovetail
with this situation?

00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:14.010
I was just curious.

00:39:14.010 --> 00:39:17.120
And you will find that
they will be nicer to you.

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:20.510
Along with that, what are
the exceptions to policy?

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:24.030
Has the airline ever made
an exception to its $200

00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:25.440
change fee?

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:30.820
Have you ever allowed after a 1
o'clock check-out in the hotel?

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:33.240
Fit within one of
the exceptions.

00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:38.180
Asking for exceptions should
be hardwired to your brain.

00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:42.220
I want to mention just three
very quick examples of this.

00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:45.420
I had a student went to
McDonald's 5:00 to 11:00

00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:47.760
on a weeknight.

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:51.140
French fries were soggy five
minutes before closing time.

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:53.060
Clerk wouldn't make
any more French fries.

00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:54.610
Without going
ballistic, the student

00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:56.220
picked up the
freshness guaranteed,

00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:59.250
which guarantees fresh French
fries during all business

00:39:59.250 --> 00:39:59.870
hours.

00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:03.150
Showed it to the clerk,
got fresh French fries.

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:04.700
No muss, no fuss.

00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:09.010
In a million different ways,
your life will be better.

00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:11.480
Had another student
rented a car from Avis

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:13.220
in Albuquerque for spring break.

00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:16.220
He got 100 miles from
the shop and realized

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:19.637
he paid too much for the car
one class higher than he got.

00:40:19.637 --> 00:40:20.720
Didn't want to drive back.

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:25.400
At the end of a week, handed in
the car and said to the clerk,

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:27.190
I need a one-class credit.

00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:29.320
And she said, you
can't have the credit

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:31.800
because it says in
the contract that you

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:35.220
pay for the car you sign
for when you leave the lot.

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:38.760
And she turned over the contract
and there was his signature

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:40.350
on the bottom of the contract.

00:40:40.350 --> 00:40:42.710
So he immediately
looked at this contract

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:45.780
and said to the service rep,
it's not my responsibility

00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:47.560
to read this contract.

00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:49.810
And she said, why not?

00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:52.300
And he said, look
at this contract.

00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:54.430
You can't even
read this contract.

00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:56.960
And if you know what rental
car contracts look like,

00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:00.330
they're 8-point light gray
type on light pink paper.

00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:03.590
Why, he said, if it
was my responsibility

00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:05.900
to read this
contract, your slogan

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:08.380
would not be "we try harder."

00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:10.280
It would be "you try harder."

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:13.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:14.270
He got the credit.

00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:15.540
One more example.

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:19.760
I had a student from Wharton
who got a job at McKinsey.

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:23.100
And she thought she
deserved a $30,000 extra

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:26.460
signing bonus because she
had eight years of experience

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:28.510
in the media
entertainment department

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:31.350
of PricewaterhouseCoopers
in LA and she was going

00:41:31.350 --> 00:41:32.830
to that department at McKinsey.

00:41:32.830 --> 00:41:35.730
Her boss-to-be agreed with
her, but said, I'm sorry.

00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:36.340
I can't do it.

00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:37.430
My hands are tied.

00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:39.590
McKinsey has got a
[? one-firm ?] policy.

00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:43.710
She thought about her goals,
which were get more money soon.

00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:46.040
So she said to her
boss-to-be, when

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:48.930
is the first time
McKinsey is allowed

00:41:48.930 --> 00:41:51.360
to pay a bonus to a new hire?

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:53.470
And her boss-to-be
said three months.

00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:55.350
And she said, why
don't you just give me

00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:57.380
the $30,000 in three months?

00:41:57.380 --> 00:41:59.660
And her boss said, sure.

00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:04.900
That negotiation took less time
than it took to tell it to you.

00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:08.200
The one thing you can't
do is make yourself

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:10.390
the issue using standards.

00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:14.850
The more outrageous they
become, the more calm

00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:16.110
you have to become.

00:42:16.110 --> 00:42:19.010
Mahatma Gandhi,
Martin Luther King,

00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:22.890
Barack Obama in the second
presidential debate.

00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:24.940
It's very, very powerful.

00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:28.560
I tend to say, be
extreme or come to me.

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:31.960
If you will come to me,
we'll be collaborative.

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:34.340
If you want to be
extreme without making

00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:37.890
myself the issue, you can
drive yourself off the cliff.

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:40.480
So if they cheat me, I'm happy.

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:42.170
We just made money.

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:44.650
Well, tell me about
what you've done here.

00:42:44.650 --> 00:42:47.180
And do you think this is
a good way to operate?

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:50.010
We've tried to reach you
20 times in the last week.

00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:53.060
We apologize for
doing something wrong.

00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:54.830
What have we done wrong?

00:42:54.830 --> 00:42:59.210
Those are irresistible
questions.

00:42:59.210 --> 00:43:01.330
What do you like most
about our competitors

00:43:01.330 --> 00:43:03.580
and hate the most about us?

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:07.640
Those are questions that should
be part of your stock in trade.

00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:12.390
Whatever these tools are,
none work all the time

00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:14.760
and some don't
work half the time.

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:18.970
But they work more than
if you don't use them.

00:43:18.970 --> 00:43:21.840
And so, let's say we're
working on an easy case.

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:23.500
You say, it doesn't
work over here.

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:24.950
And I say, forget about it.

00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:26.470
Never works over there.

00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:28.650
But if you can
increase your hit rate

00:43:28.650 --> 00:43:31.280
a few percent in
your life, you'll

00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:34.375
be fabulously more successful.

00:43:34.375 --> 00:43:36.980
Did I mention to you
the baseball analogy?

00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:37.720
There we go.

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:39.780
.280 hitter. .310 hitter.

00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:41.840
That's basically it.

00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:46.100
So here is, in a nutshell,
the three questions to ask.

00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:49.630
What do I want at the end of
the process I don't have now?

00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:51.360
Who are these people?

00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:55.700
And given the first two, what
will it take to persuade them?

00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:58.730
Different in every situation.

00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:01.270
I wanted to end with a
little anecdote based

00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:03.980
on this notion of
being incremental.

00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:07.180
Asking for something smaller.

00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:11.540
The world should follow the
technology industry's lead.

00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:14.670
Start small, put in scalability.

00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:19.210
Had they done that 30 years ago
with one health care facility

00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:21.770
or one factory in
the Middle East,

00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:23.800
we'd have a great
health care plan

00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:25.390
and peace in the Middle East.

00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:28.990
So many politicians don't
know from the concept

00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:30.270
of scalability.

00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:33.180
You can make the
difference in your own life

00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:37.360
by shortening the question,
whatever you do, and scaling it

00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:38.336
up from there.

00:44:38.336 --> 00:44:39.710
The [INAUDIBLE]
I want to mention

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:42.320
to you is I had a woman
in my class some years

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:45.570
ago whose five-year-old
daughter fell in the kitchen one

00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:49.240
Saturday morning and gashed her
forehead on the sharp corner

00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:50.580
of the kitchen table.

00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:52.340
The child was hysterical.

00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:54.860
The child's grandfather,
the father of the student,

00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:55.930
was hysterical.

00:44:55.930 --> 00:44:58.440
And the student was about
to become hysterical

00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:00.850
when she suddenly
stopped herself and said

00:45:00.850 --> 00:45:02.270
to herself, wait a minute.

00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:04.160
I'm taking a negotiation course.

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:05.720
I'm going to negotiate this.

00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:08.090
And the issue was
the child clearly had

00:45:08.090 --> 00:45:09.840
to go to the hospital
and get stitches.

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:11.560
She eventually got 12.

00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:12.790
She wouldn't go.

00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:15.160
She was clinging onto
the table for dear life

00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:18.600
and nobody could pry her little
fingers off the kitchen table.

00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:20.780
So her mother walked
over to her daughter

00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:23.755
and said to her daughter,
does Mommy love you?

00:45:23.755 --> 00:45:26.050
Her daughter said yes.

00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:29.160
Her mother said, would Mommy
do anything to hurt you?

00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:30.850
Her daughter said no.

00:45:30.850 --> 00:45:33.410
Her mother said, when
we get to be big people,

00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:36.590
do we have to do things
sometimes we don't like to do?

00:45:36.590 --> 00:45:38.150
Her daughter said yes.

00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:40.370
Her mother said,
Mommy has stitches.

00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:41.650
Showed her a scar.

00:45:41.650 --> 00:45:43.050
Granddaddy has stitches.

00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:44.490
Showed his scar.

00:45:44.490 --> 00:45:46.670
And within five
minutes, her daughter

00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:49.540
picked herself up and walked
to the car by herself.

00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:52.690
And so think about this in the
concept of being incremental.

00:45:52.690 --> 00:45:56.030
The mother thinks the daughter
feels alone and in pain.

00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:58.930
And so she asks,
does Mommy love you?

00:45:58.930 --> 00:46:00.530
An emotional payment.

00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:04.900
The first increment goes right
into the daughter's brain.

00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:08.180
The daughter then realizes
that she is not alone,

00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:09.470
but still in pain.

00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:13.070
The mother then says, would
Mommy do anything to hurt you?

00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:18.840
And so step by step, you can
bring somebody a vast distance.

00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:21.150
And in a short period
of time, if you

00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:23.250
start with the
pictures in their head,

00:46:23.250 --> 00:46:27.830
give them emotional payments
and take them step by step.

00:46:27.830 --> 00:46:31.140
And if they say, are you
being incremental with me,

00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:33.210
you say, absolutely.

00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:37.240
Is there anything wrong with
us pursuing a less-risky path?

00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:40.130
If they say, you're using
standards on me you say,

00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:42.270
what's wrong with
your standards?

00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:45.900
And so this is a
transparent process, not

00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:48.120
a manipulative one.

00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:52.310
The best that you can do is
share these tools with others.

00:46:52.310 --> 00:46:55.090
You'll all bring
down a deer together.

00:46:55.090 --> 00:46:58.700
Now, some people say,
how do I replicate this?

00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:00.490
It seems extraordinary.

00:47:00.490 --> 00:47:02.860
And so for some
situations in the book,

00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:06.880
I give more than one example of
some extraordinary situations.

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:08.380
And this is one of them.

00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:11.180
About a year ago when I was
going to a Google workshop

00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:13.070
in India, I was in
a car on the way

00:47:13.070 --> 00:47:15.600
to the airport and
somebody called me,

00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:19.160
Craig Silverman, a Long
Island investment counsel who

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:20.610
had taken the
course, and he said,

00:47:20.610 --> 00:47:22.401
I just want to tell
you something I thought

00:47:22.401 --> 00:47:23.610
you might be interested in.

00:47:23.610 --> 00:47:26.080
This morning I went for
a routine blood test

00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:27.200
at a blood lab.

00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:29.720
And before I could
get the test, there

00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:32.470
was this bloodcurdling
scream from the next room.

00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:33.280
A young girl.

00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:35.720
My nurse left me hanging there
and went to the next room.

00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:37.410
This went on for
several minutes.

00:47:37.410 --> 00:47:39.470
And finally, I decided
to investigate.

00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:41.270
He said, I went to the
next room and there

00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:44.050
was this poor little girl,
five or six years old.

00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:47.650
Her mother was holding her
shoulders back and pinning her.

00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:51.580
One of the nurses had
pinned her arm to the table.

00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:53.470
And the other nurse
was trying to stick

00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:55.270
this needle in her arm.

00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:58.462
And so Craig walked over to
the girl's mother and said,

00:47:58.462 --> 00:48:00.170
can I talk to your
daughter for a minute?

00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:01.800
The mother said OK.

00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:05.230
Craig went over to the
girl and said, look at me.

00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:07.846
Do you think your
mommy loves you?

00:48:07.846 --> 00:48:10.340
The girl said yes.

00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:12.940
Craig said, do you think
your mommy would do anything

00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:14.140
to hurt you?

00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:15.890
Girl says, no.

00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:19.660
And within two minutes,
she had calmed down

00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:22.830
and was ready to get the needle.

00:48:22.830 --> 00:48:26.280
He said, they looked at
me like I was a magician.

00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:29.140
They said, where
did you learn that?

00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:32.630
And to his credit, he
asked them to buy my book.

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:34.735
Thank you very much.

00:48:34.735 --> 00:48:39.576
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:42.220
Questions, anybody?

00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:45.443
I'm here to answer questions
on any subject involving

00:48:45.443 --> 00:48:45.984
negotiations.

00:48:48.830 --> 00:48:52.310
I'm sure somebody
has a question.

00:48:52.310 --> 00:48:54.410
Who's tried something
that hasn't worked?

00:48:54.410 --> 00:48:57.430
Who's tried something
that's frustrated you?

00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:58.910
And so forth.

00:48:58.910 --> 00:48:59.660
AUDIENCE: Got one.

00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:00.493
STUART DIAMOND: Yes.

00:49:00.493 --> 00:49:03.570
AUDIENCE: So we're in the
negotiating process for a house

00:49:03.570 --> 00:49:04.130
right now.

00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:04.963
STUART DIAMOND: Yes.

00:49:04.963 --> 00:49:07.160
AUDIENCE: Probably
a common situation.

00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:09.980
And there are, of course,
several layers of people

00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:13.580
in between us and the sellers.

00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:16.154
How can we apply your
tactics if we don't even

00:49:16.154 --> 00:49:17.945
have communication
directly to the sellers?

00:49:17.945 --> 00:49:18.820
STUART DIAMOND: Sure.

00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:21.220
The reason that there are
several layers between you

00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:23.580
and the other party
is the brokers

00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:27.660
feel fear that you
will steal the client.

00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:28.310
That's why.

00:49:28.310 --> 00:49:30.750
And so you've got to
address that explicitly.

00:49:30.750 --> 00:49:33.300
And to say, I think
you probably don't

00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:35.220
want me to talk
to the other party

00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:37.060
because you're afraid
that something will

00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:38.520
happen with the commissions.

00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:41.570
So I like to sign
the most draconian,

00:49:41.570 --> 00:49:44.560
non-circumvention agreement
you can come up with

00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:45.620
to protect you.

00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:49.140
But doesn't it seem to you that
making a personal connection

00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:51.720
with the other party
would be better?

00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:53.550
Tell me what they're
thinking and feeling.

00:49:53.550 --> 00:49:55.130
We'll bake their favorite bread.

00:49:55.130 --> 00:49:57.720
We'll wear their favorite
color, et cetera.

00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:00.590
If you can't do that,
you've got to train

00:50:00.590 --> 00:50:02.900
them to be your advocate.

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:04.945
They've got to find
out the pictures

00:50:04.945 --> 00:50:06.460
in the head of the other party.

00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:08.430
And they have to do it for you.

00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:09.460
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:12.009
STUART DIAMOND: Yes.

00:50:12.009 --> 00:50:12.550
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:50:12.550 --> 00:50:13.299
Thanks for coming.

00:50:13.299 --> 00:50:14.750
Really enjoyed the talk.

00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:18.590
So while I generally think the
approach that you're advocating

00:50:18.590 --> 00:50:21.600
is really good, and I try
to employ very similar,

00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:23.630
what about a negotiation
for a new car?

00:50:23.630 --> 00:50:26.150
I mean, does the person on
the other side of that really

00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:27.990
have any interest in my
caring about them as a person?

00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:28.760
STUART DIAMOND: For a new car.

00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:29.650
A couple of things.

00:50:29.650 --> 00:50:32.700
And there's a section
about new cars in here.

00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:35.180
First of all, you do want
to use standards, of course.

00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:37.040
What these things cost.

00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:40.300
But the other party cares
a lot more than price.

00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:43.220
When you look up at the leader
board in a car dealership,

00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:46.880
you'll see that the
sales reps are rated not

00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:49.310
on price, but on units sold.

00:50:49.310 --> 00:50:52.430
So the faster you
tell the other person

00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:54.430
you're ready to buy
a car, the better

00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:56.100
price you're going to get.

00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:57.450
Here's my contract.

00:50:57.450 --> 00:51:01.810
I will buy that car for $300
over your cost right now.

00:51:01.810 --> 00:51:03.640
Here is a certified check.

00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:06.180
Your commitment makes
you more powerful.

00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:08.720
In addition to that,
there are all kinds

00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:12.770
of other things mentioned in
the book that you can ask for.

00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:16.650
Discounts on options,
better servicing.

00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:21.760
I want a rental car
for free every time I

00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:23.760
bring my car in for servicing.

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:25.360
I negotiated that
with my dealership.

00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:28.150
And I'm one of the few
people who gets that.

00:51:28.150 --> 00:51:30.310
And so there's various things.

00:51:30.310 --> 00:51:31.690
That's another department.

00:51:31.690 --> 00:51:32.640
That's OK.

00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:34.070
You know them better than I do.

00:51:34.070 --> 00:51:35.040
Go talk to them.

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:37.000
I'll wait.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.250
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:51:38.250 --> 00:51:39.083
STUART DIAMOND: Yes.

00:51:39.083 --> 00:51:40.880
OK.

00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:42.130
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:51:42.130 --> 00:51:44.800
I wasn't sure exactly how
to phrase this question,

00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:47.730
whether I should say,
how do you negotiate

00:51:47.730 --> 00:51:49.150
with incompetent people?

00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:51.840
Or, maybe a better way
of asking the question

00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:54.840
is, how do you negotiate
with bureaucracy?

00:51:54.840 --> 00:52:00.580
When you're faced with dealing
with a wall of bureaucracy

00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:02.165
and kind of [INAUDIBLE]
beyond that.

00:52:02.165 --> 00:52:03.039
STUART DIAMOND: Sure.

00:52:03.039 --> 00:52:04.260
Several responses.

00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:06.270
First, use their standards.

00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:08.660
Second, make a connection
with the person

00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:11.590
across from you who wants
to feel their power.

00:52:11.590 --> 00:52:14.250
When a cop stops
you, you apologize.

00:52:14.250 --> 00:52:18.210
When you come to the window of a
bureaucrat at the motor vehicle

00:52:18.210 --> 00:52:20.670
department, you ask
them how their day was.

00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:23.260
Those are things that you
should do with bureaucracy.

00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:27.412
You acknowledge their power
or you use their standards.

00:52:27.412 --> 00:52:28.870
Those are the kind
of things that I

00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:30.060
would do with bureaucracies.

00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:33.250
Do you have a specific
example in mind I can address?

00:52:33.250 --> 00:52:35.600
AUDIENCE: Well, I'm
currently in the process

00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:39.300
of negotiating with
a board of education

00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:44.265
for services for my daughter
for special needs services.

00:52:44.265 --> 00:52:47.710
So it's a lot of bureaucracy
that you have to navigate.

00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:52.790
And we're exploring getting
an advocate, a special needs

00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:53.440
advocate.

00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:57.440
Which is interesting
in-- well, it's

00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:59.830
useful in that it gives
us additional information.

00:52:59.830 --> 00:53:01.430
But I also realize
it's going to up

00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:04.610
the stakes once we kind of go
into a meeting [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:04.610 --> 00:53:06.400
STUART DIAMOND: Has
this bureaucracy

00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:12.070
before ever done this more
quickly so the child doesn't

00:53:12.070 --> 00:53:13.440
have to wait?

00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:17.000
How you give a vision for
somebody-- my daughter

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:18.490
has these needs.

00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:20.980
How long should she wait?

00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:24.890
Bring her with you when you
ask people that question.

00:53:24.890 --> 00:53:28.310
How long should Judith,
Allison, have to wait?

00:53:28.310 --> 00:53:30.510
What do you think, Judith?

00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:34.870
It's really hard for them.

00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:39.010
The more you paint a
picture for somebody else,

00:53:39.010 --> 00:53:41.522
the more persuaded
they're going to be.

00:53:41.522 --> 00:53:42.230
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:44.164
STUART DIAMOND: Yes.

00:53:44.164 --> 00:53:45.580
AUDIENCE: Thanks
for coming today.

00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:47.140
So I got from your
talk that when

00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:49.137
you're making a negotiation,
you should first

00:53:49.137 --> 00:53:51.220
take the emotional temperature
of the other party.

00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:52.053
STUART DIAMOND: Yes.

00:53:52.053 --> 00:53:54.430
AUDIENCE: And then make an
emotional payment, right?

00:53:54.430 --> 00:53:57.740
Now, does it make a difference
whether the other party

00:53:57.740 --> 00:54:01.140
can sense that you have an
ulterior motive for making

00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:02.210
the emotional payment?

00:54:02.210 --> 00:54:04.370
STUART DIAMOND: A good question.

00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:08.570
I want to do things that are
going to seem fair tomorrow

00:54:08.570 --> 00:54:10.000
as well as today.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.540
So I'm not going to do
anything to hurt them.

00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:15.790
I'm also, in fact, going
to get them to do things

00:54:15.790 --> 00:54:17.500
they would otherwise not do.

00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:20.380
I don't define manipulation
as getting people

00:54:20.380 --> 00:54:22.260
to do things they
would otherwise not do.

00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:24.840
I define manipulation
as hurting people.

00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:28.150
So if they say, are you
making an emotional payment?

00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:30.640
I'm going to say absolutely.

00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:31.570
Don't you want one?

00:54:34.310 --> 00:54:37.790
In other words, this is
a transparent process.

00:54:37.790 --> 00:54:39.730
You have an ulterior motive.

00:54:39.730 --> 00:54:44.300
My ulterior motive is to
make sure we both benefit

00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:45.740
from this negotiation.

00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:47.770
That's not win-win.

00:54:47.770 --> 00:54:49.460
It's both benefit.

00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:52.570
You benefit by trading
items of unequal value.

00:54:52.570 --> 00:54:55.280
You benefit by giving each
other emotional payments.

00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:57.960
It's much more
specific than win-win,

00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:01.840
but I want to make sure that
we both get something here

00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:03.450
that benefits us.

00:55:03.450 --> 00:55:06.650
And so I think that
I owe you something,

00:55:06.650 --> 00:55:10.030
some empathy, some apology.

00:55:10.030 --> 00:55:12.560
Please tell me whether
I'm right or wrong.

00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:15.877
So I'm going to be
very explicit about it.

00:55:15.877 --> 00:55:16.710
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:19.259
STUART DIAMOND: Yes.

00:55:19.259 --> 00:55:19.800
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:21.590
How do you negotiate
with a party

00:55:21.590 --> 00:55:25.255
where there's a huge
dis-balance in trust?

00:55:25.255 --> 00:55:26.630
STUART DIAMOND:
A huge imbalance?

00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:29.910
You need to say, there's
a huge imbalance in trust.

00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:30.725
What do we do?

00:55:30.725 --> 00:55:31.350
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:55:31.350 --> 00:55:33.430
Well, as a matter
of fact, there's

00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:35.670
also a dis-balance
in understanding

00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:37.600
of what we're negotiating.

00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:40.000
If the subject is
difficult enough so

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:41.950
the other party
doesn't understand it

00:55:41.950 --> 00:55:45.910
and couldn't make a coherent
proposal to counter yours.

00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:49.450
STUART DIAMOND: If you
cannot understand what

00:55:49.450 --> 00:55:51.730
you're negotiating,
you need not--

00:55:51.730 --> 00:55:53.810
you should not start
the negotiation.

00:55:53.810 --> 00:55:57.090
The first thing you have to
do is know where you're going.

00:55:57.090 --> 00:56:00.490
If you don't, it's like getting
into the car and saying,

00:56:00.490 --> 00:56:02.110
I'm driving to San Diego.

00:56:02.110 --> 00:56:03.270
I don't know where it is.

00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:04.600
I don't have a map.

00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:05.100
OK.

00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:06.766
You're not going to
get there very well.

00:56:06.766 --> 00:56:10.970
So you really have to
spend time discussing what

00:56:10.970 --> 00:56:12.510
the party's understandings are.

00:56:12.510 --> 00:56:16.490
And yes, the less skilled
they are, the more differences

00:56:16.490 --> 00:56:18.300
there are between
the parties, the more

00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:19.720
time it's going to take.

00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:23.271
But if you don't do it this
way, you'll never get there.

00:56:23.271 --> 00:56:24.770
AUDIENCE: So you
think the education

00:56:24.770 --> 00:56:28.140
of the other party, of their
goals is the most important

00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:28.650
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:56:28.650 --> 00:56:30.650
STUART DIAMOND: These
tools are morally neutral.

00:56:30.650 --> 00:56:31.810
You can help people.

00:56:31.810 --> 00:56:33.010
You can hurt people.

00:56:33.010 --> 00:56:37.350
You've got to decide how much
help you want to give to them.

00:56:37.350 --> 00:56:40.310
I tend to help people
as much as I can.

00:56:40.310 --> 00:56:44.290
Otherwise, it's like an amateur
driver in the Indy 500 race.

00:56:44.290 --> 00:56:46.080
You crash a lot.

00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:46.760
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:47.330
Thank you.

00:56:47.330 --> 00:56:48.121
STUART DIAMOND: OK.

00:56:48.121 --> 00:56:48.850
Yes.

00:56:48.850 --> 00:56:49.780
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:51.602
Quick question from [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:51.602 --> 00:56:52.524
Can they hear us?

00:56:52.524 --> 00:56:53.800
STUART DIAMOND: Where are you?

00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:54.840
AUDIENCE: They're [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:55.631
STUART DIAMOND: OK.

00:56:58.890 --> 00:57:00.360
I'm sorry.

00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:02.260
OK, go ahead.

00:57:02.260 --> 00:57:05.060
AUDIENCE: There's a
[INAUDIBLE] usually set up.

00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:05.990
AUDIENCE: Can you hear
us from [INAUDIBLE]?

00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:06.823
STUART DIAMOND: Yes.

00:57:06.823 --> 00:57:08.202
Perfectly.

00:57:08.202 --> 00:57:08.910
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:57:08.910 --> 00:57:09.810
A quick question.

00:57:09.810 --> 00:57:11.500
I was wondering if
in your book you

00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:14.189
cover how to handle
mother-in-law, father-in-law?

00:57:14.189 --> 00:57:14.980
STUART DIAMOND: Oh.

00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:16.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:20.519
You look up mother-in-law,
you'll have lots of citations.

00:57:20.519 --> 00:57:23.060
We don't leave mother-in-laws
out of any book on negotiation.

00:57:26.374 --> 00:57:26.915
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:57:26.915 --> 00:57:27.290
Great.

00:57:27.290 --> 00:57:29.410
STUART DIAMOND: And that
includes mother in-laws

00:57:29.410 --> 00:57:32.266
and weddings.

00:57:32.266 --> 00:57:33.194
AUDIENCE: And what?

00:57:33.194 --> 00:57:33.915
AUDIENCE: At weddings.

00:57:33.915 --> 00:57:35.050
AUDIENCE: Oh, at weddings?

00:57:35.050 --> 00:57:35.590
OK.

00:57:35.590 --> 00:57:36.798
STUART DIAMOND: And weddings.

00:57:36.798 --> 00:57:38.730
And other things.

00:57:38.730 --> 00:57:39.350
OK?

00:57:39.350 --> 00:57:40.030
Yes.

00:57:40.030 --> 00:57:41.363
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks for coming.

00:57:41.363 --> 00:57:44.850
My question is, what
if we try our best

00:57:44.850 --> 00:57:48.240
to use your tools to
drive across the point

00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:49.700
we want to make
with another party,

00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:51.410
and yet it's just
not succeeding?

00:57:51.410 --> 00:57:54.320
The other party is unresponsive.

00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:56.350
What do you suggest
would be the best--

00:57:56.350 --> 00:57:59.380
STUART DIAMOND: Again, I want to
try to drum this in your heads.

00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:01.400
This is really key.

00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:03.800
The best thing you have
is your credibility.

00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:05.050
And you want to be real.

00:58:05.050 --> 00:58:08.890
You want to say, you
know, I'm a failure.

00:58:08.890 --> 00:58:11.330
I have tried to convince you.

00:58:11.330 --> 00:58:13.580
I've been totally unsuccessful.

00:58:13.580 --> 00:58:15.190
I've tried all these things.

00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:18.000
Do you have any advice for me?

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:19.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:19.710 --> 00:58:21.394
That's what you want to do.

00:58:21.394 --> 00:58:22.137
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:58:22.137 --> 00:58:22.970
STUART DIAMOND: Yes.

00:58:22.970 --> 00:58:25.294
It's disarming when you do that.

00:58:25.294 --> 00:58:26.210
RACHEL: Last question.

00:58:26.210 --> 00:58:26.840
STUART DIAMOND: Last question.

00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:27.339
OK.

00:58:30.890 --> 00:58:33.170
Anybody?

00:58:33.170 --> 00:58:33.670
OK.

00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:36.260
One more.

00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:37.550
Not one more?

00:58:37.550 --> 00:58:38.050
OK.

00:58:38.050 --> 00:58:39.049
Thank you all very much.

00:58:39.049 --> 00:58:40.520
[APPLAUSE]
