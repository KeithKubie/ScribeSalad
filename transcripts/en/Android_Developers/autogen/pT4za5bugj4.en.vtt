different computers that's why it's
 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.190
different computers that's why it's
called local storage and so if you have

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200
called local storage and so if you have
 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.510
called local storage and so if you have

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:38.870
of refraction or um you know why switch
on and off ES 3.0 I notice that there's

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880
on and off ES 3.0 I notice that there's
 

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.460
on and off ES 3.0 I notice that there's
something that I can't quite articulate

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:40.470
something that I can't quite articulate
 

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:42.350
something that I can't quite articulate
with the gems where they look much

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:42.360
with the gems where they look much
 

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:45.640
with the gems where they look much
better with it on my Illinois yes

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:45.650
better with it on my Illinois yes
 

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:48.470
better with it on my Illinois yes
basically it's also thanks to the high

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480
basically it's also thanks to the high
 

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.860
basically it's also thanks to the high
dynamic range so that the AG of situates

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:51.870
dynamic range so that the AG of situates
 

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:54.770
dynamic range so that the AG of situates
can be sharper and deflection can be

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:54.780
can be sharper and deflection can be
 

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:57.380
can be sharper and deflection can be
clearer in Southie area 3 gotcha

00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:57.390
clearer in Southie area 3 gotcha
 

00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:01.040
clearer in Southie area 3 gotcha
alright oh cool so alright I could I

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:01.050
alright oh cool so alright I could I
 

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:02.270
alright oh cool so alright I could I
could play with this for a long time but

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:02.280
could play with this for a long time but
 

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.310
could play with this for a long time but
I won't because we have other stuff to

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.320
I won't because we have other stuff to
 

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:08.030
I won't because we have other stuff to
you in our show but uh excellent so

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:08.040
you in our show but uh excellent so
 

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.900
you in our show but uh excellent so
let's see yeah other QA so in terms of

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:11.910
let's see yeah other QA so in terms of
 

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:15.440
let's see yeah other QA so in terms of
what devices support OpenGL ES 3 you

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:15.450
what devices support OpenGL ES 3 you
 

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:17.930
what devices support OpenGL ES 3 you
would mention the the Nexus 4 the Nexus

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:17.940
would mention the the Nexus 4 the Nexus
 

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.240
would mention the the Nexus 4 the Nexus
the new Nexus M isn't an excessively yes

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:20.250
the new Nexus M isn't an excessively yes
 

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:23.030
the new Nexus M isn't an excessively yes
and the Nexus 10 right other other other

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:23.040
and the Nexus 10 right other other other
 

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.980
and the Nexus 10 right other other other
devices out there how would I know if

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:24.990
devices out there how would I know if
 

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:28.780
devices out there how would I know if
the device oh well in general also today

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:28.790
the device oh well in general also today
 

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:32.990
the device oh well in general also today
GPU from Qualcomm like Adreno 320 and

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:33.000
GPU from Qualcomm like Adreno 320 and
 

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.410
GPU from Qualcomm like Adreno 320 and
the 330 she the supports a Giri is 3

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:36.420
the 330 she the supports a Giri is 3
 

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:41.270
the 330 she the supports a Giri is 3
also GPU from mali t600

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:41.280
also GPU from mali t600
 

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.580
also GPU from mali t600
should support the GL es 3

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:44.590
should support the GL es 3
 

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:46.200
should support the GL es 3
like well maybe that brings us to our

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:46.210
like well maybe that brings us to our
 

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:48.450
like well maybe that brings us to our
third question so if I'm a developer and

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:48.460
third question so if I'm a developer and
 

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:50.610
third question so if I'm a developer and
you know maybe I want to add in some of

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:50.620
you know maybe I want to add in some of
 

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:53.580
you know maybe I want to add in some of
this OpenGL ES 3 you know techniques to

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:53.590
this OpenGL ES 3 you know techniques to
 

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:56.400
this OpenGL ES 3 you know techniques to
my game but at the same time you

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:56.410
my game but at the same time you
 

00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:58.290
my game but at the same time you
actually want to support a large range

00:14:58.290 --> 00:14:58.300
actually want to support a large range
 

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:01.170
actually want to support a large range
of devices what what do you do with your

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:01.180
of devices what what do you do with your
 

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.110
of devices what what do you do with your
code to make sure that you can still

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:03.120
code to make sure that you can still
 

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.460
code to make sure that you can still
mm-hmm yeah basically to make sure that

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:05.470
mm-hmm yeah basically to make sure that
 

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:07.860
mm-hmm yeah basically to make sure that
that I can kind of have have an engine

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:07.870
that I can kind of have have an engine
 

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:09.720
that I can kind of have have an engine
that that looks really nice on the on

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:09.730
that that looks really nice on the on
 

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:11.370
that that looks really nice on the on
the machines that support it but doesn't

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:11.380
the machines that support it but doesn't
 

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:14.460
the machines that support it but doesn't
you know crash or something yeah that's

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:14.470
you know crash or something yeah that's
 

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:17.910
you know crash or something yeah that's
great question so uh yeah a little bit

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:17.920
great question so uh yeah a little bit
 

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:24.270
great question so uh yeah a little bit
today mostly most almost all the Android

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:24.280
today mostly most almost all the Android
 

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:27.200
today mostly most almost all the Android
device like 99% of device supports

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:27.210
device like 99% of device supports
 

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:31.110
device like 99% of device supports
OpenGL ES 2 but just a fraction percent

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:31.120
OpenGL ES 2 but just a fraction percent
 

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:34.080
OpenGL ES 2 but just a fraction percent
support GL es 3 so exactly that number

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:34.090
support GL es 3 so exactly that number
 

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:36.870
support GL es 3 so exactly that number
will probably grow yeah in future not be

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:36.880
will probably grow yeah in future not be
 

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.870
will probably grow yeah in future not be
3 yes that's my hope but as of today you

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:39.880
3 yes that's my hope but as of today you
 

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:43.170
3 yes that's my hope but as of today you
need to have 2 corpus whines for GL es 3

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:43.180
need to have 2 corpus whines for GL es 3
 

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:47.430
need to have 2 corpus whines for GL es 3
and another one for GL ES 2 also you can

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:47.440
and another one for GL ES 2 also you can
 

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:51.870
and another one for GL ES 2 also you can
check the existence of some OpenGL GPU

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:51.880
check the existence of some OpenGL GPU
 

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.290
check the existence of some OpenGL GPU
extension so that you can even with the

00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:55.300
extension so that you can even with the
 

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:58.560
extension so that you can even with the
GL ES 2 you can still use utilize some

00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:58.570
GL ES 2 you can still use utilize some
 

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:01.020
GL ES 2 you can still use utilize some
of the advanced to feature set available

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:01.030
of the advanced to feature set available
 

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:05.610
of the advanced to feature set available
for cs3 so I might for instance out of

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:05.620
for cs3 so I might for instance out of
 

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:06.990
for cs3 so I might for instance out of
some hardware manufacturer might have a

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:07.000
some hardware manufacturer might have a
 

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.570
some hardware manufacturer might have a
chipset that officially supports GS 2

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:09.580
chipset that officially supports GS 2
 

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:11.340
chipset that officially supports GS 2
but might support one or two features

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:11.350
but might support one or two features
 

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:14.880
but might support one or two features
from the OpenGL ES 3 right and so that's

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:14.890
from the OpenGL ES 3 right and so that's
 

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:16.920
from the OpenGL ES 3 right and so that's
something that a developer could check

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:16.930
something that a developer could check
 

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:18.600
something that a developer could check
on a feature by feature basis yeah

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:18.610
on a feature by feature basis yeah
 

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:20.430
on a feature by feature basis yeah
because I have 3 so it sounds like

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:20.440
because I have 3 so it sounds like
 

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:24.350
because I have 3 so it sounds like
complicated but it's kind of a kind like

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:24.360
complicated but it's kind of a kind like
 

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:28.020
complicated but it's kind of a kind like
PC like gaming model so in the PC you

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:28.030
PC like gaming model so in the PC you
 

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:30.330
PC like gaming model so in the PC you
need to check all of the feature

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:30.340
need to check all of the feature
 

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:33.330
need to check all of the feature
existing to utilize its most out of GPIO

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:33.340
existing to utilize its most out of GPIO
 

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:36.420
existing to utilize its most out of GPIO
service hardware so that you need to the

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:36.430
service hardware so that you need to the
 

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:39.210
service hardware so that you need to the
same single Android device so yeah it's

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:39.220
same single Android device so yeah it's
 

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:40.380
same single Android device so yeah it's
really not much different than what a

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:40.390
really not much different than what a
 

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:42.450
really not much different than what a
lot of PC developers are already doing

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:42.460
lot of PC developers are already doing
 

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:45.240
lot of PC developers are already doing
today right and maybe that brings us to

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:45.250
today right and maybe that brings us to
 

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:47.400
today right and maybe that brings us to
our second question which is I might

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:47.410
our second question which is I might
 

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:49.320
our second question which is I might
decide as a game developer this sounds

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:49.330
decide as a game developer this sounds
 

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:50.610
decide as a game developer this sounds
like a lot of work maybe I'll find an

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:50.620
like a lot of work maybe I'll find an
 

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:51.140
like a lot of work maybe I'll find an
engine

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:51.150
engine
 

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:53.630
engine
this for me are there other engines out

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:53.640
this for me are there other engines out
 

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:56.270
this for me are there other engines out
there that support this already yes so

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:56.280
there that support this already yes so
 

00:16:56.280 --> 00:17:00.110
there that support this already yes so
many game engines like unity and unreal

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:00.120
many game engines like unity and unreal
 

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:03.440
many game engines like unity and unreal
engine already supports a GL es 3 okay

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:03.450
engine already supports a GL es 3 okay
 

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:06.680
engine already supports a GL es 3 okay
so that they are for me i GL es 3 is

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:06.690
so that they are for me i GL es 3 is
 

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:10.430
so that they are for me i GL es 3 is
really easy to use but for somebody in

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:10.440
really easy to use but for somebody in
 

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.950
really easy to use but for somebody in
my tunnel souls that you can still use a

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:12.960
my tunnel souls that you can still use a
 

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:16.340
my tunnel souls that you can still use a
game engine to support GE is three other

00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:16.350
game engine to support GE is three other
 

00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:18.680
game engine to support GE is three other
ones to feed yourself okay

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:18.690
ones to feed yourself okay
 

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:20.990
ones to feed yourself okay
and I guess actually that that might

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:21.000
and I guess actually that that might
 

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.930
and I guess actually that that might
bring up good segue we do have one other

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:23.940
bring up good segue we do have one other
 

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:28.370
bring up good segue we do have one other
demo which is is the Unity engine and I

00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:28.380
demo which is is the Unity engine and I
 

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:30.290
demo which is is the Unity engine and I
suppose maybe some of this really isn't

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:30.300
suppose maybe some of this really isn't
 

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:33.290
suppose maybe some of this really isn't
so much showing off OpenGL ES 3 features

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:33.300
so much showing off OpenGL ES 3 features
 

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.510
so much showing off OpenGL ES 3 features
so much is kind of showing how how nice

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:35.520
so much is kind of showing how how nice
 

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:38.150
so much is kind of showing how how nice
things look on the Nexus 7 but it sounds

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:38.160
things look on the Nexus 7 but it sounds
 

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.430
things look on the Nexus 7 but it sounds
like they are probably doing a fair

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:40.440
like they are probably doing a fair
 

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:45.020
like they are probably doing a fair
amount of OpenGL ES 3 performances yeah

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:45.030
amount of OpenGL ES 3 performances yeah
 

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:46.940
amount of OpenGL ES 3 performances yeah
