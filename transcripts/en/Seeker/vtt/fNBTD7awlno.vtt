00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:07.299
Is marijuana smoke “healthier” than tobacco
smoke?

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:11.869
Hi everyone, Crystal Dilworth your friendly
nicotine researcher here for DNews.

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:16.440
So everybody knows that smoking tobacco causes
cancer, and second hand smoke is really bad

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.440
for you too.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.539
The mixture of gases and particles that make
up tobacco smoke contains more than 7,000

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:22.570
different chemical compounds.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.279
It’s estimated that over 250 of these chemicals
are harmful, and at least 70 of them cause

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:29.279
cancer.

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.490
But cancer isn’t the only negative effect
of smoking.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.820
Exposure to tobacco smoke immediately affects
the heart, blood vessels, and blood circulation.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.400
Many smokers die of heart disease, not cancer.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.149
For instance, in California a Tobacco Control
Program has been associated with preventing

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:50.000
59,000 deaths resulting from heart disease
between 1989 and 1997.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.070
This is partially because our bodies respond
to secondhand smoke the same way it responds

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.870
to mechanical injury, by increasing our blood
platelets.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.090
When these specialized blood cells clump together,
they stop us from bleeding.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.720
But when platelets are activated in the absence
of a gushing wound, they can aggregate in

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.520
unhealthy ways that cause strokes and heart
disease.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.980
But for those of you who think smoke from
those “other kinds of cigarettes” is probably

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.770
healthier (after all, it’s totally organic).

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:16.770
Think Again!

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.260
At least when it comes to heart disease, smoke
is smoke whether it also contains nicotine

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.720
or THC.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.630
Nicotine, the addictive component of tobacco,
and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.150
component of Marijuana, are present in second
hand smoke.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.090
So even if you don’t want to be, you are
exposing yourself to these compounds by just

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.451
being around people smoking either substance.

00:01:39.451 --> 00:01:43.030
However, a new study suggests that it’s
the other compounds in the smoke that have

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.980
a negative effect, at least, on your cardiovascular
health.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.220
Researchers used a cigarette-smoking machine
to expose rats to either tobacco or marijuana

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.990
smoke and measured the function of their main
leg artery using ultrasound.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.551
Blood vessel dilation was recorded before
smoke exposure and at 10 minute and 40 minute

00:02:01.551 --> 00:02:07.360
time points post-exposure and it was observed
that blood vessel function dropped 70 percent

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.489
after 30 minutes of exposure to either smoke.

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.469
When scientists repeated the study, this time
with tobacco that didn’t contain nicotine,

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:19.150
or marijuana that didn’t contain THC, the
same drop in function was observed.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.340
So its not the “buzz” or the “high”
that’ll give you a heart attack, it’s

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.340
the smoke itself.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.189
Aside: Don’t worry, they used a negative
control, rats exposed to plain old air didn’t

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:30.879
show reduced blood vessel function at all.

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:31.879
whew!

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:35.950
These results lead me to suspect that any
type of smoke could cause vasoconstriction

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.890
and reduced blood vessel function.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.159
So stay away from house fires.

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:44.019
And when camping, consider that if the sugar
from all those marshmallows you’re roasting

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.159
doesn’t give you diabetes, the smoke from
the campfire is probably increasing your risk

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:49.159
for heart disease.

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:54.560
So stay in school kids, don’t smoke, don’t
do drugs, and just say “no” to camping.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.260
What do you think? is marijuana smoke just
as bad as tobacco smoke?
