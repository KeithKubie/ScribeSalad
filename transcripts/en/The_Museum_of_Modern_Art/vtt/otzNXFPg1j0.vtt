00:00:10.207 --> 00:00:11.658
- My name is Jackie Delamatre.

00:00:11.658 --> 00:00:12.945
I'm a School Programs Educator

00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:14.442
here at the Museum of Modern Art.

00:00:14.442 --> 00:00:17.136
And this piece is by Frida Kahlo.

00:00:17.136 --> 00:00:19.864
It's called Self-Portrait
with Cropped Hair.

00:00:19.864 --> 00:00:22.771
I really like to teach
from this object because

00:00:22.771 --> 00:00:26.996
to me, the conversations
here really unfold

00:00:26.996 --> 00:00:29.724
like a story, a series of observations

00:00:29.724 --> 00:00:32.197
that lead into further interpretations

00:00:32.197 --> 00:00:35.912
until at the end, we're
delving into this whole area of

00:00:35.912 --> 00:00:38.779
feminism, what is beauty,

00:00:38.779 --> 00:00:41.625
of a question of a woman's
place in the world.

00:00:41.625 --> 00:00:45.290
What usually happens is they're noticing

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.592
who is this person.

00:00:46.592 --> 00:00:48.415
They're starting to
think about the clothing.

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:49.902
They're thinking about the hair.

00:00:49.902 --> 00:00:51.929
They're thinking about
the facial structure.

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:55.431
They're thinking about
the earring they can see.

00:00:55.431 --> 00:00:58.410
And their main questions
to themselves are,

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.373
"Is this a woman or is this a man?"

00:01:01.373 --> 00:01:04.770
And then we start to see and
notice the hair on the ground.

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.770
And then they start to see
the scissors and they say,

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.341
"Actually, maybe this is a
woman who cut-off her hair."

00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:12.430
But not only is it a woman
who cut-off her hair,

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.586
it's a woman who's wearing a suit,

00:01:14.586 --> 00:01:16.860
so then it brings up another question:

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.995
"Why is she wanting to look like a man?"

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:20.887
That's usually how they phrase it.

00:01:20.887 --> 00:01:24.347
Then, what it comes to is the top.

00:01:24.347 --> 00:01:26.172
There are musical notes there

00:01:26.172 --> 00:01:27.283
and they're in Spanish.

00:01:27.283 --> 00:01:29.211
And it says, "Look,

00:01:29.211 --> 00:01:32.288
"if I loved you, it was
because of your hair.

00:01:32.288 --> 00:01:34.331
"But now that you are without hair,

00:01:34.331 --> 00:01:36.266
"I don't love you anymore."

00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:38.394
One reason that I think this
piece is really relevant,

00:01:38.394 --> 00:01:40.244
really exciting to students,

00:01:40.244 --> 00:01:42.010
is the fact that this is something that

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.617
they're dealing with in their
social lives all the time.

00:01:44.617 --> 00:01:46.753
People are not necessarily
just going to like them

00:01:46.753 --> 00:01:49.725
for what's on the inside and
feeling the unfairness of that,

00:01:49.725 --> 00:01:50.988
the injustice of it.

00:01:50.988 --> 00:01:54.264
So, in this case, not
only the injustice of

00:01:54.264 --> 00:01:57.596
somebody having said, "I only
loved you for your hair,"

00:01:57.596 --> 00:01:59.118
but also the injustice of

00:01:59.118 --> 00:02:01.211
what it was like to be a
woman artist at that time,

00:02:01.211 --> 00:02:02.833
to be married to somebody who had

00:02:02.833 --> 00:02:05.920
so much fame and so much
success as a male artist,

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.347
and really having to wait posthumously

00:02:08.347 --> 00:02:10.108
to get the fame and the
love and the respect

00:02:10.108 --> 00:02:12.932
that Frida Kahlo now has
and I think really deserves.
