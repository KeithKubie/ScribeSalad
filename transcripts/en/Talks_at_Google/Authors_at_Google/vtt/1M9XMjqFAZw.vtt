MALE SPEAKER: So
welcome, everyone.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.210
I'm very excited that we have
Steve Sisgold here today.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.584
His new book, "Whoe
Body Intelligence:

00:00:08.584 --> 00:00:11.000
Get Out of Your Head and Into
Your Body to Achieve Greater

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.750
Wisdom, Confidence,
and Success."

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.504
I actually wanted to read one
of the reviews of the book.

00:00:17.504 --> 00:00:19.420
It's actually from our
very own Rachel Romero,

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.080
who set this talk up as one
of our [? G+ ?] volunteers.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.630
What Rachel says is,
"This is the intelligence

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:26.752
everyone needs.

00:00:26.752 --> 00:00:28.210
'Whole Body
Intelligence' will help

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.990
you navigate life more easily.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.530
It helps me understand
unconscious messages

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:36.480
my body cues tell me, and
transforms negative beliefs I

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.290
carry into positive ones,
all by using the intelligence

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.210
of my own body."

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.104
Rachel Romero, Sales
Manager at Google.

00:00:43.104 --> 00:00:44.770
I'm really looking
forward to this talk,

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.220
and I'd like to turn this
over to Steve Sisgold.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.450
STEVE SISGOLD: Thank you.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.750
I've been to Google three--
it's my third time here.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.760
I love the energy and
coming to the campuses.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.340
And just, of course,
I'm using it every day.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.940
Obviously, I get
my Google Alerts.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:59.914
And I'm Googling.

00:00:59.914 --> 00:01:01.580
And I used Google
Maps to get down here.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.390
So, it's pretty
exciting to be here.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.902
Today is going to be fun.

00:01:05.902 --> 00:01:07.110
It's going to be interactive.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.130
For those of you out there,
it'll be interactive as well.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.560
And we're not going
to just listen.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.130
But I'm going to
do some assessment.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.750
We're going to take
notice of different things

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.430
we feel in our body,
how that relates

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.340
to beliefs, how that
relates to our energy, how

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.120
that relates to our stress.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.930
And just to become aware
of what we're feeling.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.344
You know, for me,
people always say to me,

00:01:31.344 --> 00:01:33.510
how did you get into writing
a book about whole body

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.240
intelligence?

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.720
And I'm not a doctor.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.560
And I was not a
psychologist, even

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.550
though I did go to school,
and after my business career,

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.180
and got into body
centered psychotherapy.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.610
But basically, I was
in sales and business.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.140
I had a purpose.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.930
I felt good.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.390
I was working with people
that I believed in.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.090
And I really helped people.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.810
But I noticed a few things.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.620
This sounds strange, but I
would write and put together

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.300
these campaigns for people.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.724
And then I noticed that
they would say one thing,

00:02:03.724 --> 00:02:05.390
and their body would
say something else.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.610
They'd be talking about how
their program relaxes people,

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.570
but they'd be shaking their leg.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.670
Or how they're really
into opening their heart,

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.650
and they'd be clinging
in front of themselves.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.200
So I'm, "Wow,
something's off here."

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.350
And I really became
interested in learning

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.120
how our body's intelligence,
and our connection to our body

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.020
would actually work
towards success,

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.610
optimization of our
productivity, our energy,

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.200
finding our purpose.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.370
And one of my niches,
which we'll work on today,

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.680
is finding beliefs
that live in the body,

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.120
because the body's been
there since day one, right?

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.620
Everything we ever felt, did,
there's been enough science.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.960
Candace Pert and
other scientists

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.230
who have shown that memories
actually live in the body.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.240
Things happened.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.690
Most of us, when things happen
that were uncomfortable,

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.480
we did two things, usually.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.060
We held our breath,
just not to feel,

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.190
just that initial response,
the sympathetic nervous system,

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.040
to go into that.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.260
And then secondly, we
would roll our body

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.940
to hold onto things
that we didn't

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.940
get to speak or get
to resolve over,

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.730
didn't get to express out.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.780
So I just found pretty
much working in business,

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.280
working with people, I
would just ask them like,

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.960
"Tell me-- tell me something.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.760
Tell me how you would like
to see your department go."

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.370
And I would hear
stuff like, "Well, I'd

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.040
really like to have the
most-- [COUGH] excuse me."

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.540
I go, OK.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.560
Try it again.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.150
I'd really like to have
the most succ-- [COUGH]

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.390
--having trouble with
that word success.

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.780
And then I just started
asking questions like, "Well I

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.360
notice when you say you want to
have a successful department,

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.409
or you want your group to
be the most successful,

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:50.450
there's a little something
going on in your body.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.300
You see even though the mind
is like, Yeah, I can do it.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.420
And I want it.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.250
And I believe in it.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.900
The body still has the memories.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.990
And sometimes it will
kind of blindside us

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.730
and get in the way of us
actually having what we want.

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.460
Either we're
communicating something,

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.310
or it's just an old belief.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.060
I'll give you my own
examples in a minute.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.260
But this one fellow,
basically when

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.200
he started choking on the
word success over and over,

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.949
I basically had him
go into his body.

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:19.990
You know Einstein said,
You can't solve a problem

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:21.899
with the same thinking
that created it.

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:24.130
And a lot of us try to
keep thinking through it.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.140
So I just started really
asking people like, Well,

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.580
what do you notice here?

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.530
I call it the body
first approach.

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:36.310
Basically, a loop back to my
body to inquire instead of just

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.660
with the mind, what could
I learn from my body?

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.670
And things would happen
like, he'd say, Well.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.400
I'd say, Say it out
loud a few times.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.280
And then listen to the response.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.850
Listen to the
impact in your body.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.700
And with this
particular executive,

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.850
he found that when he said
the word success something got

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:54.594
triggered.

00:04:54.594 --> 00:04:56.510
And of course, like most
of us, what do we do?

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.010
We don't want to
feel uncomfortable,

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.960
so we push it down.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:59.960
We ignore it.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:00.470
We numb it.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.640
We do everything we can
to get away from it.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.460
My work was to get people
to actually go into it.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.570
So as he went into it,
the body starts to respond

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.740
and the familiar
feelings come back.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.360
And as he got
smaller, he had kind

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.540
of what's called a somatic
recall, or a cellular memory,

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.340
if you've ever
heard those terms.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.190
And basically by feeling in his
body and not running from it,

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.770
but actually breathing
and going into it,

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.520
he remembered something
that he had pushed aside

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.550
for many years.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:33.432
When he was young, his--
during Christmas and holidays,

00:05:33.432 --> 00:05:35.390
he would look out and
see everybody got wagons,

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.380
and bikes, and new toys.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.810
And he didn't get anything.

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.140
And every time he would
say to his dad, Hey,

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.570
dad what happened?

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.210
Why didn't I get something?

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.670
His dad would say, well son,
just don't worry about it.

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.210
You know money, success
will make you sick.

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.040
So you don't need it.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.850
Well, a little kid hears that.

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.520
He takes it in maybe
one or 1,000 times.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.520
Forgets about it,
but where did it go?

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.335
Where did that
unexpressed feeling go?

00:06:00.335 --> 00:06:01.580
It lives in the body.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.420
And you'll see
some of that today.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:07.110
So basically he had a belief
that he carried in his body.

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.680
And then you could
see it in his--

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.320
what I call his billboard.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.480
Somehow we're saying to
people, if I'm too successful,

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.820
I'll get sick.

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.210
So we worked on expressing
and getting that out,

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.440
get those feelings and
that energy moving.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.210
And then we work on
what I call vital belief

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.140
versus the viral
belief, bringing

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:29.170
in a belief that actually
was, I could be successful.

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:30.140
And I could be vibrant.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.931
I could be healthy.

00:06:30.931 --> 00:06:33.140
And of course, his body
rejected it at first.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.690
But eventually, he embodied it.

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:38.040
His whole presentation
to the world shifted.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.180
So we're going to do
some of that today too.

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.270
So just to start here on
the body first approach.

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.660
We're going to bring our
whole self into the room

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.020
and into our life and our work.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.930
And I just want to,
even as you're eating

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.780
or whatever you're doing
right now, just take a moment,

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.590
with no judgment,
just pure observation.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.760
And just notice where your
breath is originating from.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.560
Just notice, with no
judgment analysis.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.630
Like, is it way down
in your lower belly?

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:08.409
Or is it coming up in the chest?

00:07:08.409 --> 00:07:09.950
We're going to learn
some things just

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:11.850
about ourselves in the moment.

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:14.900
So take a moment
and just notice.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.900
Obviously, if we're
breathing down in our belly,

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.370
we're in the parasympathetic
nervous system, which

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:21.820
is the place that relaxes.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.650
The digestive system works well.

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:24.970
Your muscles relax.

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:27.380
Your creativity, your
brain is relaxed.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.860
You have more
creativity, more energy.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.360
Unfortunately, a lot
of us breathe up here,

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.370
which is that sympathetic
nervous system.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.960
And you know, biologically,
it's there to protect us.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.590
So what it does is it shuts
down the digestive system.

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:41.920
It tenses the muscles.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.360
The heart beats fast, so
we can get up the tree.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.390
You know, I have a dog
that's a good example.

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:50.440
So for instance, he's in
the parasympathetic most

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:50.940
of the time.

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.180
He's just hanging out.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.920
He's just eating his bone.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.590
As soon as the UPS
truck pulls up,

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:58.960
which happens a lot nowadays.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.310
The UPS truck, he hears
it, and he goes right

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:02.380
into his sympathetic.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.210
Man, he's like,
there's no digestion.

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:07.000
There's no room for food.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.977
There's no time to
breathe or relax.

00:08:08.977 --> 00:08:10.560
It's like he's got
to get to the door.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.434
And he's at the door.

00:08:11.434 --> 00:08:12.410
And he's waiting.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:14.170
And the UPS just rings the bell.

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:18.410
And then as soon as that break
is released from the truck,

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:23.370
and the UPS pulls away, he
goes right back to his bone

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:24.870
like it never happened.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:26.360
We don't do that, unfortunately.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.660
A lot of us have
that sympathetic,

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.020
and we get caught in it.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.230
And unfortunately
we're in it too often,

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:35.460
sometimes frozen in it.

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.730
And we're feeling
that stress like we

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:40.130
need to get up that tree
if a tiger's chasing us.

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:41.809
But it's not actually
working for us,

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:43.700
because it tires us out.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.890
And it causes digestive
problems, and heart,

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:48.450
and blood pressure.

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:51.000
So the second thing to
notice is, is it easier

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.430
for you to breathe in?

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:55.310
Just notice.

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:58.180
That's receiving, by
the way, oxygen, energy,

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.360
lifeforce, breathing in.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.980
Or is it easier to
breathe out, expressing?

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:07.260
I have found that about
95, 98% of the talks I do,

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.670
people find that breathing
in relates to receiving.

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:12.170
How much can I take in?

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:16.090
Compliments, success,
abundance, love.

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:19.530
And how much, my outbreath,
how free am I to express?

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.770
So anybody that would
just like to call out,

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:24.810
did you notice anything that you
didn't know just a minute ago

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:25.800
about your breathing?

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.430
Anybody?

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:28.990
Just call it out.

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:31.850
Breathing in from your
stomach or your chest.

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:33.960
Did you notice anything?

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.960
Just take a moment
and tune into that.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.810
And then you could scan your
whole body and just notice,

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:42.230
is there something I wasn't
aware of a moment ago?

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:43.790
Was I crunching up?

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:45.210
Was my fist tight?

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:47.450
Was I not breathing?

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:48.770
Are my shoulders up to my ears?

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:50.780
Am I thinking about
the future or the past,

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:52.450
instead of being in this moment?

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:55.850
And just scan your body and
again just ask yourself,

00:09:55.850 --> 00:10:00.140
is there anything I just
noticed that I wasn't

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:01.710
aware of five minutes ago?

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:04.110
Because most of the time,
we're not in our body, right.

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:05.530
We're in our screens.

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:08.870
In fact, constantly
changing habits,

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:11.010
like, for instance,
the smartphones,

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:13.570
I got the smartphone the
first weekend it came out.

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:16.100
And this is what started
to happen, right?

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.720
The looking down like this.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.850
Not realizing through the years
that it was pulling my muscles

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:22.970
up in my neck.

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:26.910
So the new habit I'm learning is
to look at my phone like this.

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:28.630
But it's more
comfortable to do this.

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:29.850
It's more familiar.

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:32.960
But there's a huge difference
in how it affects my energy,

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:36.160
cuts off your oxygen,
makes you tight,

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.611
contracted, versus expanded.

00:10:38.611 --> 00:10:41.110
So just take a moment if anybody
wants to call out anything.

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:42.640
It's interactive.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:46.120
Anything you noticed that you
didn't know five minutes ago,

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.740
about your breathing, your
posture, your scanning

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.835
your body, something
you were maybe gripping.

00:10:50.835 --> 00:10:52.210
Does anybody want
to call it out.

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:53.330
You're welcome to, please.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:54.760
AUDIENCE: I've
always wondered why

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.760
I have more difficulty breathing
in for longer periods of time

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:58.800
than breathing out.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.300
And if I relate it to
what you just said,

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:02.690
I am a very expressive person.

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:03.460
I'm talkative.

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:04.110
I'm outgoing.

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:06.180
I'm extroverted.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.770
And taking in what
you just said,

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:13.115
now I want to look at, OK, how
am I blocking, receiving then

00:11:13.115 --> 00:11:13.990
through my breathing.

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:15.615
STEVE SISGOLD: I
think that's excellent

00:11:15.615 --> 00:11:18.000
because you know the truth
is when things happen,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.640
for instance, 70% of the people
who have won the lottery have

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:22.977
lost it back.

00:11:22.977 --> 00:11:24.560
And you think, how
could they do that?

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.440
If I had $20 billion, I
would never blow it, right?

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.870
And yet what happens
is it's familiar.

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:32.050
It's familiar to be broke.

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:35.620
It's familiar to be having
trouble with your bills.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.390
All of a sudden there's millions
of dollars and it's like,

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:39.660
can't take it.

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:41.470
And that happens
sometimes with love.

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:43.100
We want to meet
that perfect person.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:46.880
But old wiring, old beliefs,
old feelings in the body

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.890
will get us to not
be comfortable,

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:51.410
and we won't really be
expressing who we are.

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:56.590
So I just found that breathing
in fully from the belly,

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:59.110
it's going to relax
your nervous system.

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:00.840
It's going to get
you into a place

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.910
where you're really
receiving oxygen.

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:05.480
And we need oxygen. We
need that life force.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:06.267
OK.

00:12:06.267 --> 00:12:08.350
Anybody else who wants to
share, just call it out.

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:09.410
That's where we are.

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:12.440
We're just in an open forum,
where you can call out and say,

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.235
Hey, I didn't notice
I was crunching up.

00:12:14.235 --> 00:12:16.350
I was thinking about
something in the--

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:17.820
that happened this morning.

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.849
And I didn't realize
my body was holding it.

00:12:20.849 --> 00:12:21.390
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:22.830
Thanks for giving
the talk today.

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:24.560
STEVE SISGOLD: Yeah,
thank you for being here.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.970
AUDIENCE: I personally noticed
that my posture definitely

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:29.350
affects my breathing
the most, whether it's

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:31.440
my shoulders in versus
my shoulders out.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:35.510
And even when I'm standing
at my desk versus sitting,

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:39.129
I find that my breathing
is much healthier, lower

00:12:39.129 --> 00:12:40.420
rather than higher in my chest.

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:41.280
STEVE SISGOLD: Thank you.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.010
Yeah, thank you.

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:44.650
What did you notice today, just
in the short little exercise?

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:47.400
AUDIENCE: Well, even
when I-- excuse me--

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.510
even when I was
sitting down just now,

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:53.185
whether I had my leg on
my other, crossed, right?

00:12:53.185 --> 00:12:55.060
I could notice my
breathing kind of like cave

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:56.950
in versus my shoulders back.

00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:58.307
It was really interesting.

00:12:58.307 --> 00:12:59.890
STEVE SISGOLD: Because
in every moment

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:05.490
there's an expansion
and a contraction.

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:07.350
And if they're not
balanced, then we're

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:08.740
more in the contraction.

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:10.528
When we're contracted,
obviously it's

00:13:10.528 --> 00:13:11.903
going to cut off
the oxygen. It's

00:13:11.903 --> 00:13:13.200
going to cut off the breathing.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.110
And if we have
something on our mind,

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:17.190
and we don't realize
our body's like this.

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:20.970
Now, I had a wonderful
offer for this new book

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:22.230
from the publisher.

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:24.000
They made me a great deal.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.557
And they said, You can
have it out in 2016.

00:13:26.557 --> 00:13:27.640
And I was like, All right.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.139
I mean, that's how it usually
goes, a year, year and a half.

00:13:30.139 --> 00:13:32.829
They said, however,
however, if you

00:13:32.829 --> 00:13:34.370
can get it done in
seven weeks, we'll

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:35.839
put it out in the summer of '15.

00:13:35.839 --> 00:13:37.130
Well that was incentive for me.

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:39.090
Of course, seven
weeks to write a book.

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:43.010
But here's what happened, I
would lean into my computer.

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:45.690
And the more I wrote the
more I would go into it.

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:47.870
And I had no idea.

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:49.750
It constricts your creativity.

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:51.280
It's constricting my breathing.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:53.490
My fiancee would walk by
because she's into yoga.

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:55.740
And she would yell
out, slump asana.

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:57.530
You know what asana
means, it's posture.

00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:58.180
Slump asana.

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:00.890
I go, ah, thank you.

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:03.950
And all of a sudden
my brain would relax.

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:07.440
As we go further, you'll
notice movement opens

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.150
a new neural net in your brain.

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:11.810
Anytime you feel
stuck, get up and move.

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:13.340
It starts to open up the brain.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:15.660
It gets the oxygen moving.

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:17.760
Often we're sitting too much.

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.780
So what we're really
focusing on today

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:23.350
is having an expanded awareness.

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:27.640
Instead of just IQ and
EQ, we're going to use BQ.

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.000
Obviously, you've
heard a lot about EQ.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.210
And that's basically
that I am feeling

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:34.540
and sensitive to your emotions.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:38.250
And I'm also compassionate
and feeling my own emotions

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:40.020
[AUDIO OUT] express them.

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:42.030
One thing I've noticed
with EQ is sometimes

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:43.490
people don't know
what they feel.

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:45.700
They go, well, I
think I'm angry.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:46.260
I'm not sure.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:47.000
Maybe I'm sad.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.760
I'm just not sure.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.730
So that's where,
again, we use the body.

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:53.260
And we start to breathe,
and notice, and feel.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.610
And the body will allow
us to really notice

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:58.560
what we're feeling and
what we're not feeling.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:01.660
So with this expanded
awareness, as you can see,

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:03.100
there's a lot of advantages.

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:04.910
You detect stress.

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:06.330
You can notice.

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.940
I call the body your
thought monitor.

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:11.240
If you're slumping,
if you're contracting,

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.790
most likely you're having
a negative thought,

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:15.680
or you're thinking
something about someone.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.940
It's not a happy thought, right?

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:19.640
When we're happy,
we make a touchdown.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.444
You know, we're like
a big open peacock.

00:15:21.444 --> 00:15:23.860
And when we're contracted,
we're like a little bird that's

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:26.290
just been through an oil spill.

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:28.490
So it's just something
to catch every day.

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:31.654
It's like either
we're open or closed.

00:15:31.654 --> 00:15:33.070
The same thing
with the breathing.

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:36.277
And that can happen because
the thought is thinking

00:15:36.277 --> 00:15:38.610
about something that happened
this morning, or a meeting

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:41.910
later, or an incomplete
communication with someone.

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:45.110
And then the thought creates
a feeling into the body.

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:47.450
And as we go further
on in our talk today,

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:50.450
you'll see how it actually
affects the brain and the body.

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:52.350
Every thought is affecting us.

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:54.730
So I use the body as
a thought monitor.

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:57.020
If I'm slumping,
there's a reason.

00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:59.520
There's something going
on that's making me slump.

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.150
If I'm contracting,
there's a reason.

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:04.460
So your body can really
become a great detector.

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:07.750
And you can catch when
you're assuming and blaming,

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:09.570
instead of being body first.

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:11.970
Body first, I'll give
you a quick example.

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:14.500
So I lived in Hawaii
for about six years.

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.870
And one day I was
at Waimea Canyon.

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:19.399
If you know about it in
Kauai, it's beautiful.

00:16:19.399 --> 00:16:20.940
It's like the Grand
Canyon of Hawaii.

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:22.090
It's pretty amazing.

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:23.270
And I'm sitting on the rock.

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:26.610
And I'm actually feeling
the warmth of the rock.

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:28.470
And as I'm looking
out at the canyon,

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:31.530
I'm noticing and
breathing, and noticing

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:33.910
how expanded the
view makes me feel,

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:35.920
and how beautiful
the colors are.

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:39.120
And I'm having a
whole body experience.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:42.565
Up comes a tourist bus and the
guy gets off, and he comes up.

00:16:42.565 --> 00:16:43.940
And then right
away he says, hey,

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.380
have you ever heard
of little river?

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:47.220
Not sure.

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:48.830
Yeah, little river
is where I live.

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:50.570
And it doesn't look like this.

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:52.550
Yeah, we don't have
this where I live.

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:56.150
And he went, took a picture
and got back on the bus.

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:59.010
So that's somebody that didn't
have a whole body experience,

00:16:59.010 --> 00:16:59.510
you see.

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:02.030
He barely-- I don't know
even if he looked at it.

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:04.319
But the point is
we do that a lot.

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:07.030
At work, somebody drops
something on our desk.

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:10.180
Somebody asks us something
that demands of us.

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:12.180
And instead of
feeling and noticing

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:15.500
the impact it had on
us, we go into our mind.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:16.470
Well, they're wrong.

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:17.579
And I'm going to call my friend.

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:18.703
I'm going to talk about it.

00:17:18.703 --> 00:17:20.400
We waste a lot of time.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:23.240
So imagine if we just
took that moment and went,

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:26.200
Wow, I'm noticing my stomach
got tight when she said that.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.420
I wonder what that might be.

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:30.350
And often as we go further
into presentation today,

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:32.030
you'll see often
that's a memory.

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:34.510
That's something that has
nothing to do with the moment.

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:36.840
But the moment
triggered the past.

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.820
And as we learn more about
ourselves, and how we get

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:42.030
triggered, whether
we've been betrayed.

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:43.640
So on our first
date, we're already

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:46.630
projecting that this person
is going to betray us.

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:48.390
I was a sales trainer.

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:51.170
It was part of how I got
into this is watching people.

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:52.210
Here's the truth.

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:55.000
When I leaned forward,
because I was a little needy

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.550
and I wanted the sale,
my customers leaned back.

00:17:57.550 --> 00:18:01.170
And then I was like, I
didn't get any sales.

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:04.540
When I leaned back and
was aware of my breathing,

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:08.260
my tensions, my tightening,
and I relaxed, I got orders.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:11.140
I became the number one sales
rep out of 500 salespeople.

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:13.510
And it was an inner
game the whole time.

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:14.850
My machines were the same.

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:16.150
I sold business equipment.

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:18.250
They weren't much different
than anybody else's.

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:19.900
But it was my presentation.

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.360
It was basically, the
more I relaxed I was,

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:24.010
the more clients
wanted to be with me.

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:28.200
So just take a moment and think
about that, and feel into this.

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.420
And in my journey, I've
been very fortunate

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:33.280
that I've worked in
a medical office.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.920
So I've been working
on this with medical.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.830
People have asthma, tight,
arthritis and stuff.

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:41.940
A lot of it is
unexpressed feelings,

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:43.160
and unexpressed emotions.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.830
So if you're young, I want to
encourage you, breathe, move,

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:48.130
and express.

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:50.230
Everyday, constantly moving.

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:51.580
You'll see why in a few moments.

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:54.180
But not to hold things in.

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:56.220
I think holding
things in is really

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.330
where we start to
build up that tension.

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:01.290
It starts to wreck
havoc on our bodies.

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:02.752
So I've worked in
medical offices.

00:19:02.752 --> 00:19:04.460
I've been in a lot of
buildings down here

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:05.910
in the Silicon Valley.

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:08.530
I've been very fortunate to
give speeches and so forth.

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:11.120
One day I got a phone call.

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:14.180
And it was a school of
physical therapists.

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:16.400
And they said, how would
you like to come to Mexico?

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:19.350
We're taking a whole group down
to this really remote place.

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:21.580
And we want them to learn
whole body intelligence.

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:23.340
Hey, that sounds great.

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:24.820
So I fly to Mexico.

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:25.600
And I get off.

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.210
I'm taken to this nice hotel.

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:28.620
We have a nice lunch.

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:31.970
And then I'm told, the boat
will be here in a few moments.

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:33.150
OK, good.

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:34.370
So the boat comes.

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:37.260
It's a little fisherman's boat.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:40.380
And I and half the
class get in it.

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:44.820
And we come up to this remote
island that has no electricity.

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:46.800
And I get there.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.320
And we go to this
beautiful palapa.

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:51.790
Like this nice house with these
open windows and everything.

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:53.540
This is where we're
going to have a class.

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:56.850
But you as the teacher, you're
going to have the top palapa.

00:19:56.850 --> 00:19:57.860
Oooh, top palapa.

00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:58.687
OK.

00:19:58.687 --> 00:19:59.520
Top of the mountain.

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.880
Meantime, it's a
straight-up jungle.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.150
This is not a picture.

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:07.840
But I want to give you an idea
of that palapa that I got,

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:09.660
that amazing palapa.

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:13.980
It was like this in the
sense that it had no walls.

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.162
It wasn't next to a river.

00:20:15.162 --> 00:20:16.620
It was in the middle
of the jungle.

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:18.750
But it was like this that
basically I got up there

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:20.875
and there was a
hammock and no walls.

00:20:20.875 --> 00:20:22.250
And I'm at the
top of the jungle.

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:24.458
And I'm thinking, Oh my god,
you know, what did I do?

00:20:24.458 --> 00:20:26.720
What did I sign up for?

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.340
So it's almost sunset.

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:29.180
And it gets dark.

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:32.690
And I'm hearing [ANIMAL NOISES]
all these animals under me.

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:34.950
I'm like, Oh my
god, this is crazy.

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:37.500
Oh, by the way, the guy
who carried my suitcase up

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:40.060
to the palapa told me,
turn over your shoes

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:41.590
because there's a
lot of scorpions.

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:42.810
I'm like, oh, great, great.

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:44.817
So, I'm turning over my shoes.

00:20:44.817 --> 00:20:47.150
I'm laying in this hammock,
like, oh my god, what am I--

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:49.620
how am I going to get
through the night?

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:52.140
I just let the animals
below me go to sleep.

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:54.470
I got up in the morning and
it was beautiful, peacocks

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:55.200
and everything.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.980
But here's what I want to share.

00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:59.920
I got up and there
was a vibrant village.

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.870
I had never seen
anything like it before.

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:02.965
There was no electricity.

00:21:02.965 --> 00:21:03.840
There were no phones.

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.210
There were no smartphones.

00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:07.470
There was nothing,
except they woke up.

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:08.637
And I got up pretty early.

00:21:08.637 --> 00:21:10.470
I mean as soon as that
sun, I was like ready

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:13.660
to get out of my
palapa and go down.

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:15.500
Everybody was up.

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:17.420
Everybody was moving.

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:18.920
Everybody was doing something.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:22.410
Little, older, it didn't
matter, lifting, grabbing,

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:25.320
moving, smiling, happy.

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:29.420
And it was pretty amazing to
see such a vibrant community.

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:30.640
No one was laying down.

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:31.670
No one looked depressed.

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:34.620
Everybody knew exactly what
they were supposed to do.

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:37.490
So I started my class.

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:40.470
And I had people
breathing and releasing

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:42.350
and getting some stress out.

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:44.970
And a couple people were
making some loud sounds.

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:47.810
So all of a sudden, a bunch
of the villagers ran up.

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:50.270
And the one who really
spoke English well

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:51.499
said, what's going on?

00:21:51.499 --> 00:21:52.290
What are you doing?

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:53.040
I said two things.

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:56.021
I said, well, we're helping
people release some stress

00:21:56.021 --> 00:21:57.270
that they carry in their body.

00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:59.990
And they were totally
confused by that.

00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:02.350
And I said, and also, maybe
some things from their past

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:03.558
that they want to get rid of.

00:22:03.558 --> 00:22:05.990
Well that, they had no idea
what I was talking about.

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:08.380
They said, we don't
understand this concept.

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:09.540
We get the words.

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:11.380
And we understand
what you're saying.

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:13.630
But we don't know
this concept, stress.

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:14.854
Imagine that.

00:22:14.854 --> 00:22:16.520
Like this is a village
where people just

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:17.890
get up and live their life.

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:20.350
And then at night, they sing
and it's a whole community

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:20.850
together.

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:23.570
We don't understand
this concept, stress.

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:25.490
Secondly, we don't
know what you mean

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:28.570
by having something in
the past, because they

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:30.287
engage in every moment.

00:22:30.287 --> 00:22:32.620
When they're picking something,
they're engaged with it.

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:35.036
When they're playing with the
kids, they're engaged in it.

00:22:35.036 --> 00:22:37.220
Unfortunately, a lot
of us, unlike the dog,

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:40.780
we-- something
happens, we freeze.

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:42.660
It goes into our body.

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:44.990
And as you'll see
later, the neural net

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:47.960
starts to stay in that thought.

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:50.410
And then next thing
you know that stress,

00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:53.300
even though something happened
a day ago, or a week ago,

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:56.250
or a month ago, or a year
ago, is still in our bodies.

00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:57.460
Does that make sense?

00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:59.220
Yeah, we carry too much.

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:01.330
So we've got to find
ways to intervene,

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:02.530
catch those thoughts.

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:05.127
And move forward.

00:23:05.127 --> 00:23:06.960
So here's what I took
away from the village.

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.460
And this is something that each
of us can really learn from.

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:12.120
Number one, they were
all part of a community.

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:13.380
No one was isolated.

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:14.870
No one was alone.

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:16.350
They knew what
their purpose was.

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:17.060
They woke up.

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:18.150
And they just lived.

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:21.560
Secondly, they understood
clearly what their culture was.

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:23.120
They aligned with their culture.

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:24.830
Third, they thrived.

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:27.210
Whatever their role
was, it was fine.

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:28.980
I went around that
village for two weeks.

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:30.080
No one was unhappy.

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:32.479
No, there was no
competition, jealousy.

00:23:32.479 --> 00:23:34.270
It was just like, I'm
doing what I'm doing.

00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:35.710
And I'm OK with it.

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:38.349
Never felt isolated, they
were engaged in the moment,

00:23:38.349 --> 00:23:39.640
no matter what they were doing.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:40.320
And I watched.

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:41.850
And they were
breathing, and moving,

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:47.192
and expressing, so that their
energy levels were higher.

00:23:47.192 --> 00:23:48.150
They weren't exhausted.

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:49.108
They weren't depressed.

00:23:49.108 --> 00:23:51.160
They didn't have to run
to coffee at two o'clock.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.780
They were energized and moving.

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:54.960
So they breathed, moved
and expressed themselves.

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.960
And they ate a healthy
energizing diet.

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.580
So just something to learn.

00:23:58.580 --> 00:23:59.320
I came back.

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:02.670
And I was totally committed to--
I started a business exchange.

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:04.330
I got involved in my community.

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:06.030
I changed my diet.

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:09.230
I made sure that I was really
clear about my purpose.

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:12.430
And I was aware of what when I
wasn't engaging in the moment.

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:15.910
When I was stuck in my head,
versus feeling and noticing

00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:19.090
in my body.

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:22.240
Years later-- years
later after that,

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:23.490
I heard about this Blue Zones.

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:25.073
I don't know if
you've heard about it.

00:24:25.073 --> 00:24:27.130
But there's even a
book out about it now.

00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:29.440
And there was some population
experts, some doctors,

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:32.170
some physicists that
went around the world

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:34.720
to look for where people
had higher longevity.

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:37.980
And they found very much
of what I saw that there

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:39.250
was big social engagement.

00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:39.970
There was family.

00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:41.130
They put less smoking.

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:43.320
They had a clean diet.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:48.176
But here's the key, constant
moderate physical activity.

00:24:48.176 --> 00:24:49.110
Constant.

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:52.480
So when my son was growing
up, because I taught him

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:54.999
how to breathe and move, he
would get up all the time

00:24:54.999 --> 00:24:55.540
in his chair.

00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:57.750
And the teachers would call me
and go, hey, what's going on.

00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:59.000
He's not supposed to stand up.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.050
I went, they're
sitting too long.

00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:05.510
So I highly recommend that
you get up from your chairs

00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:08.160
as much as you can
and just walk around.

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:10.160
What it'll do is it'll
get you to breathe.

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:11.534
It will get you to move.

00:25:11.534 --> 00:25:13.700
But more than anything,
there have been studies done

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:17.220
that show when we move, the
neural nets of our brain

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:17.969
start to open up.

00:25:17.969 --> 00:25:19.510
And then we can get
creative thought.

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:21.580
So when I work with a
group, we're walking.

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:22.140
We're moving.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:25.050
Any time there's a stuck
moment, all right, everybody up.

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:26.240
Let's breathe and move.

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.620
And all of a sudden, the
energy in the room changes.

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:29.990
The thoughts change.

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:32.940
And we're out of that
locked in brain neural net.

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:38.270
So movement is a
key to all of this.

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:40.650
Here's, unfortunately,
what a lot of us are doing,

00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:42.070
and there's so
much study on this.

00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:43.070
I'm sure you've seen it.

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:48.850
You know American Psychiatry
Association-- Psychological

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:51.600
Association, thousands
and thousands of workers,

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.220
67% of people aren't engaged.

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:55.270
They're stressed.

00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:58.910
80% of people are stressed
at their office visits.

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:02.510
So the point is we obviously
have some stress from change.

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:04.864
A lot of us aren't
used to change.

00:26:04.864 --> 00:26:07.030
When we were young [? or ?]
[? something ?] changed.

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:09.590
So resilience really
is the ability

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:13.370
to breathe through, to me, and
move through and tell the truth

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:14.514
when something changes.

00:26:14.514 --> 00:26:16.430
So just remember that,
when something changes,

00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:20.230
rather than getting into your
mind and getting frozen, get up

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:22.970
and breathe and move and
get that energy moving.

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:25.300
Obviously, the lack
of control at times.

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:26.840
Am I getting enough support?

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:29.440
Stress in relationships,
because we're not

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:30.840
speaking authentically.

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:32.736
We're often just projecting.

00:26:32.736 --> 00:26:34.110
Well, when you
did that, when you

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:36.520
did that, versus
the communication

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:39.490
I teach in offices
is when you did that,

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:42.050
or when you said that to me,
I noticed a little stress

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:42.760
in my chest.

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:46.890
It's something that I felt,
or something happened to me.

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:49.100
Sometimes, you can talk
with people like that.

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:50.070
Sometimes you can't.

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:53.250
But the idea is is for
you to be aware of what

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:55.980
I call the body first,
the loop of awareness,

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:58.120
for you to be
aware in your body.

00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:59.740
How did that impact me?

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:02.100
When I saw that, how
did that impact me?

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:04.760
When my boss gave me
this, or my project leader

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:08.110
gave me this task,
what happened for me?

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:10.380
So that you can have a
whole body experience

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:12.780
and really be engaged,
what's happening for

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:14.130
me in this moment?

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:17.460
So that's the versus
the blue or the stress.

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:19.420
And of course, as
we know, we used

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:22.120
to be very intrasomatic, right.

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:23.155
This is how we were.

00:27:23.155 --> 00:27:24.940
We felt. We smelled.

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:25.520
We sensed.

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:27.540
If you watch babies,
they breathe.

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:29.160
Their belly goes up and down.

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:29.780
They smell.

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:31.700
They're very into
their environment.

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:36.650
Until things happen and then
we go extra extrasomatic.

00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:39.280
Basically, extrasomatic
means that we're

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:42.120
trying to get all of our
information from outside.

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:45.590
So what I'm suggesting is
start to go into the body,

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:47.290
because the body was
there from day one.

00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:48.498
It will give you information.

00:27:48.498 --> 00:27:51.800
If your stomach's yelling,
when you're wanting to say no,

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:53.200
listen to it.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.490
Most of us override it.

00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:55.980
I was a people pleaser.

00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:56.940
I would override it.

00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:58.450
And then I would be so upset.

00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:00.250
Why did I say yes to that?

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:02.140
I don't want to do this tonight.

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:04.770
I've made it a habit
to go, wait a second.

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:06.310
You know, I'm getting a no.

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:07.870
Or let me call you back.

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:09.460
So trust your gut.

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:10.550
There's a reason.

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:13.360
Deepak Chopra talks about
the mobile brain in a book

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.390
by Candace Pert.

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:17.250
She has an amazing book
around your molecules

00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:18.390
and your emotions.

00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:20.520
And basically,
what he was saying

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:22.720
is that there's a
mobile brain, meaning

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:25.750
there's brains and
intelligence in our whole body,

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:27.750
except we're all in
smartphones so much

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:30.110
and we're on virtual
that we forget.

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:32.200
So most of us are
living up here.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.850
Secondly, Paul Pearsall wrote
a book, "The Heart's Code."

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:39.730
And what he discovered as a
surgeon, a heart-- transplants,

00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:43.790
that the recipients who
actually got the new heart

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:47.710
took on characteristics,
sometimes even food-- the foods

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:50.290
that they desired were
from the person who died.

00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:52.810
What does that tell
you about the heart?

00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:53.820
Anybody.

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:55.072
AUDIENCE: Muscle memory.

00:28:55.072 --> 00:28:55.780
AUDIENCE: Memory.

00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:57.770
STEVE SISGOLD: But
imagine that the heart,

00:28:57.770 --> 00:29:01.010
not in the body of John,
but in the body of Bill,

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:04.510
Bill starts to take on some
memories, some feeling,

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:06.450
some new thoughts.

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:08.910
There's also a guy
named Larry Gershon.

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:11.700
And Doctor Gershon
talks about the gut.

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:15.020
Says the gut has total neurons.

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:16.550
The gut is like neuropeptides.

00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:19.020
The gut is like
the brain up here.

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:20.640
That's why we call
it gut instinct.

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:23.590
So just really take a
moment and take in oh,

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:28.690
how often am I going outside
when maybe I could go inside?

00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:31.530
So here's what I get phone
calls for a lot, when

00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:34.260
I come down to Silicon Valley
or I go into companies.

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:37.090
Hey, we need life work balance.

00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:39.170
I think that's a great concept.

00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:40.580
I think it's a great concept.

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:41.890
It's great to take a vacation.

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:45.122
But here's what happens, even
when people go on vacation,

00:29:45.122 --> 00:29:46.080
they're still thinking.

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:47.910
They're still using
their smartphones.

00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:50.690
They're-- it takes three
days to kind of wind down.

00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:51.632
I lived in Hawaii.

00:29:51.632 --> 00:29:52.840
People would come for a week.

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:53.680
I want go, uh-oh.

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:55.221
Because it took them
three, four days

00:29:55.221 --> 00:29:57.592
just to feel their body again.

00:29:57.592 --> 00:29:59.800
And then they'd be planning
on when they had to leave

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:01.174
and what they had
to get back to.

00:30:01.174 --> 00:30:03.450
So work life balance is great.

00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:07.530
But I'd like to go more
into mind body balance.

00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:11.850
Meaning how often
I'm using my mind,

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:14.180
how often am I
unplugging and getting

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:20.030
into my body, exercise, yoga,
dance, movement, taking a walk,

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:20.970
swimming.

00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:22.180
Here's the difference for me.

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:23.892
And this is so true.

00:30:23.892 --> 00:30:25.350
When I wake up in
the morning and I

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:27.930
do my breathing exercises,
a little bit of stretching,

00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:31.440
and then I go to the swimming
pool, I get all these ideas.

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:32.890
I get downloads in the water.

00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:37.070
Like my whole day is, I've
set a tone for the day.

00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:39.500
But when I don't do that and
I go right to the machines,

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:41.630
or right to the
phones, right to work.

00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:43.170
It's a different day.

00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:46.100
Because I'm already in my mind,
and my body's been left behind.

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:47.300
Does that make sense?

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:50.960
So we really need to activate
and stay in the body more

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.400
than anything.

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:56.320
So what I'd like to do is have
everybody take a few moments.

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:59.760
And for those of you that are
watching live, or watching this

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:01.820
later, you'll get
it on the screen.

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:05.670
We're going to ask you to just
take a moment with no judgment,

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:07.920
just to get an
assessment, just to have

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:11.920
an assessment of
basically where am I

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:13.460
in my body mind connection?

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:14.930
We're going to do this together.

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:16.710
One question at a time.

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:19.920
If you want to use a pen and
give yourself a score, you can.

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:25.620
At the end, you can
also go to a web link

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:29.780
and actually get a response
to your specific score,

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:34.360
as well as tips and videos and
audio that will support you.

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:37.440
No charge, just to
boost your score.

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.100
You'll have a 1 to 10.

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:40.880
For those of you
watching from out,

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:42.920
you'll be able to
go from 1 to 10.

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:45.890
One meaning not often.

00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:48.310
10 meaning all the time.

00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:49.740
So let's go through
this together.

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:53.240
The first question,
I consciously take

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:57.050
pauses from what I am doing
to take a few deep, full

00:31:57.050 --> 00:31:59.510
relaxing breaths.

00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:03.310
By the way, there was a
study-- The Framingham Study--

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:10.260
73% of our toxins are removed
from the respiratory system.

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:11.160
I never knew that.

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:13.470
I thought it was sweating,
going to the bathroom.

00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:15.730
You probably did too.

00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:18.300
That alone should make you
breathe more consciously.

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:22.860
73%, so we really need to clear
our toxins through the lungs.

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:23.910
OK.

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:28.430
Next question, I am generally
aware of my breathing dynamic.

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:31.310
For instance, I catch myself
when I'm holding my breath,

00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:34.990
or notice when I'm breathing
labored or high up in my chest.

00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:38.330
Just one if you never
do that, and 10 if you

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:39.780
always or somewhere
in the middle.

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:49.354
Third question is I scan my body
to connect with how I'm really

00:32:49.354 --> 00:32:50.270
feeling in the moment.

00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:53.350
For instance, I check to
see if my belly is relaxed,

00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:55.720
my shoulders are
crunched, or to see if I'm

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:57.020
tightly gripping the phone.

00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:58.260
Boy, I tell you what.

00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:01.180
If you do spot checks
and scan your body

00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:03.540
and keep that integrative
conversation going

00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:06.410
between your brain and your
body, it's helped people.

00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:09.482
I've gotten people that
had headaches and neck

00:33:09.482 --> 00:33:11.190
aches because they
were crunched all day.

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:12.500
And they didn't know it.

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:14.540
Driving to work,
didn't know that they

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:15.980
were gripping the wheel.

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:17.500
Just that asking myself.

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:19.350
I have a lot of clients
just ask yourself

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:22.020
several times a day, what
am I noticing in my body

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:25.120
as I scan my body?

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:27.240
When I feel an uncomfortable
sensation, pain,

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:30.600
or emotion in my body, my
tendency is to tune into it

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:33.850
and listen to what it might
be telling me versus ignoring

00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:35.920
my body or numbing myself.

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:37.370
A lot of us ignore our bodies.

00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:39.260
We were told not to feel.

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:42.070
We were punished
if we felt. I even

00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:45.300
have a story of recently when
I was in the hot springs,

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:48.200
a little girl was having
the best time in the pool.

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:52.250
Her mom came screaming up,
I've got some lemonade for you

00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:52.940
honey.

00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:55.273
And she looked up like, oh,
I'm having fun in the water.

00:33:55.273 --> 00:33:56.110
But OK.

00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:57.010
It wasn't a lemonade.

00:33:57.010 --> 00:33:58.960
It was cucumber
water from the spa.

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.140
Now, I'm sorry.

00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:02.620
Cucumber water is
not lemonade, right?

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:05.430
Lemonade's lemon, sugar, honey.

00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:07.240
So this little
girl, I watched it,

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:09.760
this is what happens
to so many of us.

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:10.570
She drinks it.

00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:12.320
She doesn't like it
and she hands it back.

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:13.770
But mom's disappointed.

00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:15.199
Mom wants her to like it.

00:34:15.199 --> 00:34:16.800
So mom says, it's good.

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:17.429
Try it again.

00:34:17.429 --> 00:34:20.239
Well after about
three pleads from mom.

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:22.610
She finally goes,
Yeah, it's good.

00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:23.699
And then mom walked away.

00:34:23.699 --> 00:34:24.990
And the little girl contracted.

00:34:24.990 --> 00:34:26.980
Just think about
that for a second.

00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:28.060
Mommy, I'm hot in here.

00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:29.110
It's not hot in here.

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:30.111
Oh.

00:34:30.111 --> 00:34:32.110
What happens to the little
kid when they're told

00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:34.746
they don't know what they feel.

00:34:34.746 --> 00:34:36.366
AUDIENCE: They can't
trust their body.

00:34:36.366 --> 00:34:37.699
They can't trust their emotions.

00:34:37.699 --> 00:34:39.407
STEVE SISGOLD: You
can't trust your body.

00:34:39.407 --> 00:34:41.630
You can't trust your--
so some of us heard that.

00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:45.489
Even if it was benevolent like,
oh, this bathtub's too hot.

00:34:45.489 --> 00:34:47.469
Oh, get in, it's fine.

00:34:47.469 --> 00:34:48.389
I'm scared.

00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:49.520
Oh, you're not scared.

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.659
Those kind of things
happen to many of us.

00:34:51.659 --> 00:34:54.783
So many of us learn to
escape, to not feel it.

00:34:54.783 --> 00:34:56.949
We don't want to feel it
because it's uncomfortable.

00:34:56.949 --> 00:34:59.730
Or if we feel it and tell
somebody what we felt,

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:01.980
they might not believe us.

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:09.150
So the next question is, I'm
cautious of the negative things

00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:10.200
I say about my body.

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:12.460
For instance, my boss
gives me a headache.

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:15.020
One client I work with
had a neck ache, back neck

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:16.310
ache for six years.

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:18.720
Take this in.

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:20.930
I said to him, what
started six years ago?

00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:22.020
He said, let me think.

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:23.561
Let me-- oh, yeah,
I stopped paying--

00:35:23.561 --> 00:35:25.070
I stopped paying the IRS.

00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:26.460
I said, OK.

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:28.120
Let's see if there's a link.

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:30.684
What did you do when you
started not paying the IRS?

00:35:30.684 --> 00:35:31.850
He said, Well, I got scared.

00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:34.300
And I would always have this
saying, Oh, forget about it.

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:37.620
Put it in the back of my head.

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:39.690
Six years this guy had
off and on a headache.

00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:41.007
I told him, Call the IRS.

00:35:41.007 --> 00:35:42.340
They're not going to arrest you.

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:44.131
They're going to ask
for a monthly payment.

00:35:44.131 --> 00:35:45.910
He called the IRS,
made a monthly payment,

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:47.500
headache went away.

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:50.060
What I'm trying to say is,
there's enough science,

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:54.400
if you look, that says, if you
say you know I hate my body.

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:55.950
My boss makes me sick.

00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:57.590
That's a pain in my neck.

00:35:57.590 --> 00:35:59.529
Your body's intelligent.

00:35:59.529 --> 00:36:00.570
You're sending a thought.

00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:03.194
You'll see a film soon that will
show you exactly what happens.

00:36:03.194 --> 00:36:06.580
If you're sending that thought
every day, I'm not good enough.

00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:07.980
I'm not going to get the job.

00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:09.480
I'm-- whatever that is.

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:11.180
It starts to wire it in.

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:13.550
It gets fixed as an identity.

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:15.760
It gets fixed in the brain.

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:18.800
So that even though you want
to have another thought,

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.900
the brain is used to
and becomes addicted

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:22.540
to that emotional response.

00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:23.800
Does that make sense?

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:25.990
The more we say it,
our body believes it,

00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:28.310
and then we start to believe
that that's who we are.

00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:29.340
And we're not.

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:31.380
We're not necessarily
any of those things

00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:33.126
that people told us we were.

00:36:33.126 --> 00:36:34.060
All right.

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:35.560
Just keep going
through the test.

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:38.970
I'm aware of how congruent my
words and body language are.

00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:40.850
So when somebody says,
how are you doing?

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:42.670
You go, fine.

00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:43.810
They're going to notice it.

00:36:43.810 --> 00:36:45.960
You're gripping your jaw,
You're gripping your--

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:48.950
How often do you say something,
and your body language

00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:49.680
is shaking?

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:51.290
When you say, no,
I'm good with it.

00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:53.020
And then you're nervous.

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:55.620
Everybody picks up on that,
whether we know it or not.

00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:57.470
More than ever,
people are very keen.

00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:58.530
They're observant.

00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:01.510
So if it's affecting how you
sell, how you communicate,

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:03.560
how you are in
your relationships,

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:08.120
just ask yourself, am I-- are
my words and my body congruent?

00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:09.740
Are they aligned?

00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:12.780
The next question for you
is, when I make decisions,

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:16.090
whether they're small or
large, do I listen to my body?

00:37:16.090 --> 00:37:17.940
Take that in for a moment.

00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:20.600
Do you make decisions
because somebody told you?

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:23.450
Do you make decisions because
you want to please somebody?

00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:25.870
Do you make decisions just
off the top of your head?

00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:28.820
Or do you take a
moment and go, boy,

00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:32.150
when I was asked to do that,
why is my stomach tightening up?

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:33.850
Maybe there is something
to learn there.

00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:35.560
Maybe your stomach has a memory.

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:37.980
Maybe your stomach--
your body reaction

00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:40.194
is smarter than your
mind for the moment.

00:37:40.194 --> 00:37:42.360
Maybe your body has something
that's very important.

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.550
So I've trained myself
to take a moment

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:47.330
and listen the loop of
awareness, back to the body,

00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:49.860
to go, why is my body
having that response

00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:53.800
to that belief, or that
abundance, or that love,

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:54.500
or that gift?

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:57.310
Why is my body
responding that way?

00:37:57.310 --> 00:37:59.710
I'm aware of my posture.

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:00.790
This is really important.

00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:02.980
When we get up and down,
when we sit at our desk,

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:05.300
when we get out of a car,
when we get in a car,

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:08.870
these are transitions that
the more aware you become

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:10.360
that's whole body intelligence.

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:13.450
I'm aware of how I get
up, how I sit down,

00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:17.756
how I slouch, how I come home,
how I walk through the door.

00:38:17.756 --> 00:38:19.880
Becoming more aware, it
doesn't mean you're a robot

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:21.629
and you're thinking
about it all the time.

00:38:21.629 --> 00:38:23.070
It just becomes a new awareness.

00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:25.430
Your brain starts to activate.

00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:28.270
Oh, yeah, when she said
that I noticed I bent down.

00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:29.350
Maybe I'll stand up.

00:38:29.350 --> 00:38:31.750
I work with
presentations, speakers,

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:33.180
people who are on
stage, and they

00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:35.960
have no idea that they're
up there shaking their hand.

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:37.450
Or they're talking
about one thing,

00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:39.300
and their body's
giving another message.

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:40.700
It's just unconscious.

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:42.550
Once they become
aware of it, what

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:45.360
happens is they can make
that physical change, become

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:48.240
more congruent, and they'll
get a better result.

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.450
People will believe you more.

00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:50.450
That's the key.

00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:52.140
Because you'll be
more authentic.

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:55.240
I'm aware of any past
trauma, events, memories

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:58.610
that I hold in my body and how
they influence my behavior.

00:38:58.610 --> 00:39:01.350
Real quicky, I'm
pretty confident.

00:39:01.350 --> 00:39:03.450
Hopefully I look relaxed.

00:39:03.450 --> 00:39:04.431
I love doing this.

00:39:04.431 --> 00:39:05.180
This is what I do.

00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:06.370
And I love doing it.

00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:08.820
However, the first time
I left my neighborhood.

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:12.360
I grew up in a row house
neighborhood in Baltimore City.

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:15.060
You've seen films like Barry
Levinson, and other films.

00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:16.770
That was my neighborhood.

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:17.940
And everything was safe.

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:18.850
Everybody was an aunt and uncle.

00:39:18.850 --> 00:39:20.780
There were no locks,
never heard of crime,

00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:23.710
never knew of anything other
than Hey, this is a good life.

00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:26.330
23 cousins, we just
played ball in the street.

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:28.560
The first time about
three of my cousins and I

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:31.751
decided to leave the
neighborhood, the first time,

00:39:31.751 --> 00:39:33.250
we went up to the
main thoroughfare.

00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:34.290
I stuck out my thumb.

00:39:34.290 --> 00:39:36.320
I was all excited to go.

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:39.740
And what happened was a car
pulled up with some rough guys

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:42.890
that I had never seen in my
life-- these kind of guys.

00:39:42.890 --> 00:39:43.486
They got up.

00:39:43.486 --> 00:39:44.360
They called us names.

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:45.070
They beat us up.

00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:46.600
We ran home.

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:48.160
What's the belief?

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:50.310
Not here, because
I'm always excited.

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:54.910
But what's the belief that
sometimes my body might show me

00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:58.000
before I get on a stage,
before I get on a big TV show,

00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.420
before I get on something?

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:01.570
Does anybody want to
guess what the belief that

00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:04.820
lives in my body is?

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:06.210
AUDIENCE: Fear.

00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:07.568
STEVE SISGOLD: Fear of--

00:40:07.568 --> 00:40:08.780
AUDIENCE: New things.

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:09.940
STEVE SISGOLD: New things.

00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:10.980
It's big out there.

00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:12.345
Hey, you're excited.

00:40:12.345 --> 00:40:14.470
There's going to be a
million people watching this.

00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:15.880
My mind's going, Woohoo!

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:18.430
All of a sudden my body goes,
oh my god, what's going on?

00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:20.721
I've been in the green room
where I start to feel that.

00:40:20.721 --> 00:40:23.490
And I realize, oh, rather
than trying to push that aside

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:25.950
and go do my interview.

00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:26.740
What is that?

00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:29.131
Oh, yeah, oh, that
reminds me of-- yeah.

00:40:29.131 --> 00:40:29.630
OK.

00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:33.520
So that happened then, my
body has a memory of it.

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:36.147
Things that happen
will trigger us.

00:40:36.147 --> 00:40:37.730
And then we start
to make assumptions.

00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:38.940
She's going to dump me.

00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:40.670
My boss doesn't like my job.

00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:41.970
I didn't do a good job.

00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:43.840
But most of those are not true.

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:45.500
They're just old body memories.

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:47.210
And fortunately, I breathe.

00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:48.080
I shake it out.

00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:49.570
And I say the opposite.

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:50.480
I'm going to be safe.

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:51.350
People are going to love it.

00:40:51.350 --> 00:40:52.290
I'm going to have a good time.

00:40:52.290 --> 00:40:53.360
And my body relaxes.

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:54.710
And I go have a good interview.

00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:58.570
So it's a really important thing
to remember is like, how aware

00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:03.220
am I of how past
events affect me today?

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:05.740
Do I share what I
feel with people?

00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:09.040
Or do I stuff it and hold it
in and let my body hold it?

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:13.010
That causes a lot of today's
modern illnesses and diseases,

00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:14.920
stuff that's being held in.

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:18.500
Once you express it,
it makes a big change.

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:21.220
I set aside 30 minutes
a day, at least

00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:23.930
30 minutes, to walk,
move, breathe, yoga,

00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:24.840
something physical.

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:30.010
I have physical
techniques and practices

00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:31.300
that I use to cope with.

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:33.160
And we're going to
practice one today called

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:35.790
the rebooting technique.

00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:38.140
And then 13, I have a
stress management program

00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:41.690
or ritual that I follow
daily, such as meditation,

00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:44.430
prayer, somatic techniques.

00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:46.270
So let me ask you
a question, anybody

00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:47.359
that wants to call it out?

00:41:47.359 --> 00:41:48.150
What did you learn?

00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:51.270
Did you learn anything about
yourself, with no judgment,

00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:54.080
from taking that
assessment test?

00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:56.134
AUDIENCE: It was
kind of-- I think

00:41:56.134 --> 00:41:57.800
I'm pretty good on
some of these things.

00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:02.310
But like the one
about the when I

00:42:02.310 --> 00:42:06.020
feel an uncomfortable sensation,
do I tune into it or ignore it?

00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:08.020
But the thing is, I put
a little asterisk on it,

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:11.809
because I don't always, I'm
not always aware of them.

00:42:11.809 --> 00:42:13.100
STEVE SISGOLD: Yeah, that's it.

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:15.390
We're not aware of it because
we're not in our body.

00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:17.640
We're often in our
heads most of time.

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:22.540
Secondly just the idea of, when
I feel it, I have a choice.

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:23.707
Every moment's choice point.

00:42:23.707 --> 00:42:24.623
Am I going to numb it?

00:42:24.623 --> 00:42:25.680
Am I going to ignore it?

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:28.507
What I'm encouraging you to
do is feel it a little bit.

00:42:28.507 --> 00:42:30.840
It's kind of like when you
put something in the laundry,

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:31.923
and you leave it in there.

00:42:31.923 --> 00:42:32.960
It gets funky.

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:35.630
When you take it all the
way through the dryer, ah.

00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:36.780
That's how I feel.

00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:38.030
I taught my son that.

00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:39.110
I teach everybody.

00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:41.350
When you have a
feeling, get it out.

00:42:41.350 --> 00:42:42.220
Move it through.

00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:44.650
Don't have it build
up in your body.

00:42:44.650 --> 00:42:45.420
OK.

00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:48.160
So what I want to do,
the rebooting technique.

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:50.410
Then I'm going to show you
a little film on the brain.

00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:51.930
And then I will take questions.

00:42:51.930 --> 00:42:55.430
So this is a technique that
everybody can practice.

00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:58.450
I'm working with 80
attorneys over at Ebay

00:42:58.450 --> 00:42:59.940
who are doing this twice a day.

00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:03.090
Communication's increased.

00:43:03.090 --> 00:43:04.770
Everybody's feeling rebooted.

00:43:04.770 --> 00:43:09.750
Bottom line is you're plugged
in so many hours a day.

00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:12.420
I have an executive,
a sports executive,

00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:14.730
really big organization.

00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:19.990
He tells me, I have traumatic--
the worst part of my day

00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:20.970
is 10 minutes.

00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:24.400
Does anybody want to guess
what those 10 minutes are.

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:25.490
Just throw it out.

00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:26.380
What do you think?

00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:28.310
AUDIENCE: When you put your
phone or your computer away.

00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:29.476
STEVE SISGOLD: That's close.

00:43:29.476 --> 00:43:30.520
Put my computer away.

00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:33.490
The hardest part of his day
is the shower in the morning.

00:43:33.490 --> 00:43:34.410
Isn't that crazy?

00:43:34.410 --> 00:43:37.560
For 10 or 15 minutes,
he has mega anxiety

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:39.950
because separation
anxiety from the phone.

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:40.970
Who might be calling?

00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:41.760
What did I miss?

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:43.090
Did a trade happen?

00:43:43.090 --> 00:43:44.540
I know that sounds extreme.

00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:47.760
But this is what I'm
seeing all the time.

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:49.320
The adrenaline of that phone.

00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:52.700
Sending a text and until it
comes back with a response.

00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:55.580
And then the brain, even
though we multitask a lot,

00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:57.000
there's been so many studies.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.320
I've got many in
my book, that show

00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:01.271
that multitasking
actually-- we're

00:44:01.271 --> 00:44:03.270
using one part of the
brain when we're speaking.

00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:05.940
Another part of the
brain while we're typing.

00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:08.040
Back and forth until our
brain gets exhausted.

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:11.740
And we press send and we're,
Oh, I didn't want to send that,

00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:12.930
because we're not focused.

00:44:12.930 --> 00:44:15.470
So our brain just
gets a lot of work

00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:17.390
that we don't want
to have to deal with.

00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:19.240
So let's go through
the rebooting.

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:20.840
Step one is to unplug.

00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:23.650
And like I said in some
cases like that gentleman

00:44:23.650 --> 00:44:25.010
it's really hard to unplug.

00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:27.430
But I'm recommending
twice a day, just

00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:29.240
like a meditation practice.

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:31.920
You go into the chill room
or you sit at your desk.

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:35.150
And you unplug, meaning
everything turns off.

00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:37.320
Second, let's practice.

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:39.390
You take three deep
breaths from way

00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:44.750
down here, through
your nose and just ah.

00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:45.620
Relaxing the jaw.

00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:47.370
A yawn is a stress release.

00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:48.810
So feel how that feels.

00:44:48.810 --> 00:44:50.380
You do three of those.

00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:51.980
It's a simple technique.

00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:55.620
Then you observe, like
we've been doing here today.

00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:57.890
Just scan your body
and notice, ooh.

00:44:57.890 --> 00:44:59.940
I didn't notice my
shoulder was up to my ear.

00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:02.220
I didn't realize I
was leaning forward.

00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:04.750
I was crunching my legs.

00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:07.050
Four, you report to yourself.

00:45:07.050 --> 00:45:09.570
The brain body is now
speaking to each other.

00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:11.400
Oh, I'm noticing
my stomach's tight.

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:16.560
When she said that to me, I
noticed I got gripping my hand.

00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:19.200
Step five, make an adjustment.

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:20.800
Shake it out.

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:21.600
Move it up.

00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:22.520
Get up.

00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:24.780
Shake out your body.

00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:26.420
Just notice you can
move through that.

00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:28.430
And then seven,
is reboot, meaning

00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:34.290
take the time to actually notice
and make a conscious decision.

00:45:34.290 --> 00:45:37.650
So before I walked in
here, before I met Van,

00:45:37.650 --> 00:45:39.700
I sat in my car and I did
the rebooting technique

00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:42.200
so I could be aligned.

00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:45.680
Let the stress out, any stress
I was holding from driving down,

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:48.100
or anticipation of this talk.

00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:50.040
And then I let it go.

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:51.590
And then I'm congruent.

00:45:51.590 --> 00:45:52.470
I'm in my body.

00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:54.350
And I'm in my mind.

00:45:54.350 --> 00:45:57.290
This was a test done, just
to give you some validity,

00:45:57.290 --> 00:45:59.070
at a medical center.

00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:00.560
Lots of patients
went through it.

00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:03.540
On an average, 55%
stress reduction

00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:05.560
from doing these seven steps.

00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:08.097
Heart went from
erratic to smooth.

00:46:08.097 --> 00:46:09.180
That's what we want to do.

00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:13.340
We want to have a smooth
relaxed day each day.

00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:15.670
So these viral and vital
beliefs I told you about.

00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:18.570
Now want to show you how
they affect our income.

00:46:18.570 --> 00:46:20.110
So this is the brain.

00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:24.100
And what you're seeing there
basically-- that's your brain.

00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:27.370
That's so, the movie gave me
permission to use these clips.

00:46:27.370 --> 00:46:29.695
So see those little sparks,
that's those thoughts.

00:46:29.695 --> 00:46:31.820
If right now you're having
a thought like, Oh, god,

00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:32.320
I got to go.

00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:33.650
Or I'm feeling this.

00:46:33.650 --> 00:46:35.140
What happened this morning.

00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:35.860
I'm no good.

00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:38.590
Whatever it is, that's
shooting a synapses,

00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:41.785
that's shooting a
thought into your brain.

00:46:41.785 --> 00:46:43.410
It's not just something
that's up here.

00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:44.530
It's in here.

00:46:44.530 --> 00:46:45.610
Now here's what happens.

00:46:45.610 --> 00:46:46.276
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:46:46.276 --> 00:46:48.780
-The brain is made up of tiny
nerve cells called neurons.

00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:50.530
These neurons have
tiny branches that

00:46:50.530 --> 00:46:54.170
reach out and connect to other
neurons to form a neural net.

00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:56.336
Each place where they
connect is integrated

00:46:56.336 --> 00:46:57.935
into a thought or a memory.

00:46:57.935 --> 00:47:00.540
Now the brain builds
up all its concepts

00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:02.440
by the law of
associative memory.

00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:05.550
For example, ideas,
thoughts, and feelings

00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:07.740
are all constructed
and interconnected

00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:10.140
in this neural net and all
have a possible relationship

00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:11.120
with one another.

00:47:11.912 --> 00:47:14.370
STEVE SISGOLD: Now here's the
key, watch what happens here.

00:47:14.370 --> 00:47:16.911
-We know physiologically that
nerve cells that fire together,

00:47:16.911 --> 00:47:17.630
wire together.

00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:18.910
STEVE SISGOLD: This is
what happens in your brain

00:47:18.910 --> 00:47:20.701
if you keep saying
something over and over.

00:47:20.701 --> 00:47:22.440
- --of a long term relationship.

00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:24.700
If you get angry
on a daily basis,

00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:26.820
if you get frustrated
on a daily basis,

00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:31.060
if you suffer on a daily
basis, if you give reasons

00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:33.530
for the victimization
in your life,

00:47:33.530 --> 00:47:35.730
you're rewiring
and reintegrating

00:47:35.730 --> 00:47:37.430
that neural net
on a daily basis.

00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:39.670
And that neural net now has
a long term relationship.

00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:40.530
STEVE SISGOLD: You
don't ever know it

00:47:40.530 --> 00:47:41.904
but you're thinking
that thought.

00:47:41.904 --> 00:47:43.930
- --nerve cells
called an identity.

00:47:43.930 --> 00:47:47.080
We also know that nerve cells
that don't fire together

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:48.710
no longer wire together.

00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:49.210
They--

00:47:49.210 --> 00:47:50.320
STEVE SISGOLD: This
is an intervention.

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:53.242
This is like rebooting, taking
a break from those thought.

00:47:53.242 --> 00:47:54.970
Get up and move.

00:47:54.970 --> 00:47:57.760
- -- that produces a chemical
response in the body.

00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:00.440
Every time we interrupt
it, those nerve cells

00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:03.730
that are connected to each other
start breaking the long term

00:48:03.730 --> 00:48:05.065
relationship.

00:48:05.065 --> 00:48:06.100
[END PLAYBACK]

00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:06.850
STEVE SISGOLD: OK.

00:48:06.850 --> 00:48:10.720
So just for a moment, to
yourself, think about one thing

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:13.320
that you would like to create
in your life right now.

00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:15.840
Whether it's work,
whether it's a project,

00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:19.310
whether it's bringing your art,
whether it's falling in love,

00:48:19.310 --> 00:48:21.580
take a moment and just
think about something

00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:24.830
that you want in your life.

00:48:24.830 --> 00:48:26.534
Good.

00:48:26.534 --> 00:48:28.700
What's happening in your
body as you think about it?

00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:29.980
Sometimes people get tight.

00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:31.590
Sometimes people get excited.

00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:32.930
Just be aware.

00:48:32.930 --> 00:48:35.980
Because what happens
is, when we have

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:39.290
those thoughts of our vision,
of our goals, or our dreams,

00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:42.430
the body is responding.

00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:45.440
Like the fellow who
couldn't embody success.

00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:48.030
I worked with a person who
wrote hits, hit records.

00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:49.827
And all of a sudden
he couldn't write.

00:48:49.827 --> 00:48:52.410
And what happened was there were
memories that were coming up,

00:48:52.410 --> 00:48:54.380
because it had been a
year since he toured.

00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:57.000
And at the last tour, he
lost some people in his life,

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.500
had some negative things happen.

00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:00.750
So in his body
was the memory of,

00:49:00.750 --> 00:49:02.900
touring's not going
to be good for me.

00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:04.500
And it blocked the brain.

00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:07.200
So this is a lot of my work
has been helping people.

00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:10.450
What could be blocking you
from just going all the way?

00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:13.860
Like if I thought, Well, I can't
sell a book because everybody's

00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:14.560
selling books.

00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:15.880
And I'll never get a publisher.

00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:17.671
And I don't have anything
important to say.

00:49:17.671 --> 00:49:19.270
If I said that over
and over and over,

00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:21.990
that would lock into a
neural net in my brain.

00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:24.170
And I would never be
able to write a book.

00:49:24.170 --> 00:49:28.440
So I intervene, shake that
out, say the opposite,

00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:31.220
move the energy, and all of
a sudden, my brain's free.

00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:33.480
And I'm starting
to open up a space

00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:36.830
to actually be aware and
awake that I actually

00:49:36.830 --> 00:49:37.600
could sell a book.

00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:39.780
I actually could do well.

00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:42.070
I could actually go up
four levels in my job.

00:49:42.070 --> 00:49:44.151
I could actually create
somebody in my life

00:49:44.151 --> 00:49:45.150
that's going to love me.

00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:47.611
See, so the brain
is so important

00:49:47.611 --> 00:49:48.860
but it comes through the body.

00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:52.360
So what I want to ask before
we go into questions is,

00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:55.960
ask yourself for a moment, what
did I learn about myself today?

00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:58.590
Just take a mental
note, something

00:49:58.590 --> 00:50:00.890
you learned about
yourself from this talk.

00:50:00.890 --> 00:50:07.300
And secondly, what
will you do to-- OK.

00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:13.630
What will you do to
get more resilient,

00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:14.850
boosting your energy?

00:50:14.850 --> 00:50:16.840
Just take a moment
and ask yourself that.

00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:19.300
What did I take away from today?

00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:22.490
And what can I do that would
make my life different?

00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:24.206
Maybe it's breathing
more cautiously.

00:50:24.206 --> 00:50:25.580
Maybe I learned
today that I want

00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:29.500
to scan my body more and not
crunch up when I could be open.

00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:32.620
Maybe I learned to communicate
instead of hold something in,

00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:34.357
and catch those thoughts.

00:50:34.357 --> 00:50:35.440
So is there any questions?

00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:39.291
Anybody here have a question
that you would like to ask?

00:50:39.291 --> 00:50:41.040
AUDIENCE: So where do
you find the balance

00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:44.030
of maybe overcommunicating?

00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:45.689
And how would you express that?

00:50:45.689 --> 00:50:46.730
STEVE SISGOLD: Thank you.

00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:48.688
Well, you know, I don't
go to the grocery store

00:50:48.688 --> 00:50:51.250
and tell people, Hey,
I noticed today--

00:50:51.250 --> 00:50:53.980
but I find it's really
important for me to number one,

00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:57.040
communicate with myself
several times a day.

00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:58.560
Oh, I'm gripping the wheel.

00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:00.900
Glad I said I noticed that.

00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:04.300
Also in my business
communications, my fiancee,

00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:07.840
my son, my close, I'm
willing to say hey, when you

00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:09.090
said that it didn't feel good.

00:51:09.090 --> 00:51:10.700
I'm not making it about you.

00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:12.340
But I'm inquiring.

00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:15.740
What I really look for is
coworkers and collaborators

00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:17.157
where we can go
in there together.

00:51:17.157 --> 00:51:19.490
Hey, when you said that, it
brought up something for me.

00:51:19.490 --> 00:51:20.610
And it's in my body.

00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:21.970
Let me see what it is.

00:51:21.970 --> 00:51:24.730
Tremendous new insights,
tremendous intimacy,

00:51:24.730 --> 00:51:28.160
tremendous communication
comes out of that.

00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:29.060
OK.

00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:29.560
Thank you.

00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:30.300
Does that help?

00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:33.930
So the balance is if you're
feeling it strong enough,

00:51:33.930 --> 00:51:35.560
you either have to
say it to yourself

00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:37.187
and go outside and shake it out.

00:51:37.187 --> 00:51:39.270
Or you need to communicate
directly to the person.

00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:41.210
Because what'll happen
is, [BREATH IN] it

00:51:41.210 --> 00:51:42.760
will implode inside of us.

00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:45.850
And that's what causes a lot
of the disease in our bodies.

00:51:45.850 --> 00:51:46.940
It's just overwhelmed.

00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:49.880
Pamela Peeke, tremendous
person in stress,

00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:51.380
she's at the
University of Maryland,

00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:54.110
says, our bodies just can't
hold that many thoughts

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:55.990
and that much stress in a day.

00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:58.390
So that's why I swim,
and breathe, and move,

00:51:58.390 --> 00:51:59.450
and kind of balance it.

00:51:59.450 --> 00:52:02.610
But I like to communicate
what I feel because that's

00:52:02.610 --> 00:52:05.310
more what I'm engaging in
the moment, versus what

00:52:05.310 --> 00:52:07.750
I'm projecting, assumptions,
blame, and so forth.

00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:09.630
It's changed my life.

00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:11.957
Just less stress on me,
better relationships.

00:52:11.957 --> 00:52:13.790
AUDIENCE: Thanks again
for giving this talk.

00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:15.260
It's been really great.

00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:17.684
I had a question regarding
number four on the survey.

00:52:17.684 --> 00:52:18.850
STEVE SISGOLD: Yeah, please.

00:52:18.850 --> 00:52:20.350
AUDIENCE: So you
talked a little bit

00:52:20.350 --> 00:52:23.530
about how when you have an
uncomfortable sensation,

00:52:23.530 --> 00:52:26.050
it's better to
kind of internalize

00:52:26.050 --> 00:52:29.615
it and realize what's going on
rather than just push it away.

00:52:29.615 --> 00:52:31.656
Because even though you
try to-- I guess the goal

00:52:31.656 --> 00:52:32.240
is kind of the same.

00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:33.060
When you push it
away, you're trying

00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:34.510
to overcome it with your mind.

00:52:34.510 --> 00:52:36.197
But your body
still remembers it.

00:52:36.197 --> 00:52:38.530
So I'm just wondering like
if you have any advice on how

00:52:38.530 --> 00:52:42.120
do you go about helping your
body overcome it as well

00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:43.239
and not just your mind?

00:52:43.239 --> 00:52:44.280
STEVE SISGOLD: Thank you.

00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:45.810
That's a great
question by the way.

00:52:45.810 --> 00:52:50.260
So here's the thing,
when something comes up

00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:52.965
that's uncomfortable, like
me being in the green room

00:52:52.965 --> 00:52:55.640
and hearing my name and then
all of a sudden I get tense.

00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:58.380
If I tried to push it
away, what would happen

00:52:58.380 --> 00:53:00.670
is that would strain my
body, I would be faking it.

00:53:00.670 --> 00:53:02.253
And I would go out
and do an interview

00:53:02.253 --> 00:53:04.530
that was kind of like
still holding on to it.

00:53:04.530 --> 00:53:07.470
So what I always do
is I breathe and I

00:53:07.470 --> 00:53:09.270
feel where it is in my body.

00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:10.950
And I go right to that spot.

00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:11.830
And I touch it.

00:53:11.830 --> 00:53:13.250
And I breathe into it.

00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:14.299
And then maybe I shake.

00:53:14.299 --> 00:53:15.840
And if I get in
touch with something,

00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:17.200
I start to say the opposite.

00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:18.580
You know, I am safe.

00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:19.560
I will be fine.

00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:20.680
I am going to be received.

00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:21.690
Whatever it is.

00:53:21.690 --> 00:53:25.440
But I think, in any case, if
you're feeling uncomfortable

00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:27.200
about something, get some help.

00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:28.050
Do some breathing.

00:53:28.050 --> 00:53:29.180
Do some moving.

00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:30.660
And go outside and move it.

00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:32.410
Because what'll
happen is, the more

00:53:32.410 --> 00:53:35.050
we swallow it, like
we saw in the film.

00:53:35.050 --> 00:53:37.270
It just says, I can't feel.

00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:39.390
Or I've got to hold on to this.

00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:42.710
Quick story, somebody had
asthma in one of these talks.

00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:43.680
I'm not a doctor.

00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:46.360
But I just said, when
you breathe what happens?

00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:47.070
It gets stuck.

00:53:47.070 --> 00:53:48.635
And she was afraid to feel it.

00:53:48.635 --> 00:53:49.510
It was uncomfortable.

00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:51.470
Nobody wants to
feel uncomfortable.

00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:54.200
But what happened is by feeling
it she got in touch with-- when

00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:58.110
her grandfather died and she was
young, she was told don't cry.

00:53:58.110 --> 00:53:59.040
Don't be upset.

00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:00.360
Don't be angry at the funeral.

00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:02.110
And she kept holding it.

00:54:02.110 --> 00:54:05.530
And she got into a habit of
rather than saying what I feel,

00:54:05.530 --> 00:54:08.140
I was trained to hold it in.

00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:09.450
Asthma.

00:54:09.450 --> 00:54:12.960
She expressed out what she
felt in a few sessions.

00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:14.930
And the asthma went away.

00:54:14.930 --> 00:54:18.840
In other words, get in
to get it off your chest.

00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:20.210
That's literally it.

00:54:20.210 --> 00:54:21.450
Get it off your chest.

00:54:21.450 --> 00:54:22.500
MALE SPEAKER:
Thanks again, Steve.

00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:23.600
STEVE SISGOLD:
Thank you so much.

00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:24.433
Thank you everybody.

00:54:24.433 --> 00:54:25.570
Thanks out there too.

00:54:25.570 --> 00:54:28.070
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:28.070 --> 00:54:30.076
Have an amazing day.
