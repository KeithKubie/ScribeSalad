00:00:00.467 --> 00:00:02.955
Voiceover:"For a senior
project, Richard is researching

00:00:02.955 --> 00:00:04.923
"how much money a college graduate can

00:00:04.923 --> 00:00:07.699
"expect to earn based on his or her major.

00:00:07.699 --> 00:00:10.443
"He finds the following interesting facts:

00:00:10.443 --> 00:00:13.393
"Basketball superstar Michael Jordan was a

00:00:13.393 --> 00:00:16.925
"geology major at the
University of North Carolina.

00:00:16.925 --> 00:00:19.203
"There were only three
civil engineering majors

00:00:19.203 --> 00:00:20.839
"from the University of Montana.

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:22.765
"They all took the exact same job

00:00:22.765 --> 00:00:25.795
at the same company,
earning the same salary.

00:00:25.795 --> 00:00:29.771
"Of the 35 finance majors
from Wesleyan University,

00:00:29.771 --> 00:00:32.756
"32 got high-paying consulting jobs,

00:00:32.756 --> 00:00:35.185
"and the other 3 were unemployed.

00:00:35.185 --> 00:00:37.411
"For geology majors from the University of

00:00:37.411 --> 00:00:40.699
"North Carolina the median
income will likely be ..."

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:42.131
and we have some options here,

00:00:42.131 --> 00:00:44.972
"less than, equal to or
greater than the mean."

00:00:44.972 --> 00:00:46.681
And then we have to answer
the same questions ...

00:00:46.681 --> 00:00:48.907
"For civil engineering
majors from Montana,

00:00:48.907 --> 00:00:50.114
the median income ..."

00:00:50.114 --> 00:00:51.979
Well actually these are both about median.

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:53.260
"The median income will be ..."

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.902
and we compare it against the mean.

00:00:54.902 --> 00:00:56.988
And then, "For finance
majors from Wesleyan ..."

00:00:56.988 --> 00:00:59.409
We're going to compare the
median income to the mean.

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:01.163
So to visualize this a little bit more,

00:01:01.163 --> 00:01:03.130
I've copied and pasted
this exact same problem

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.795
onto my scratchpad, so here it
is, I can now write on this.

00:01:07.795 --> 00:01:10.447
So, let's think about each of these.

00:01:10.447 --> 00:01:13.959
"For geology majors from UNC,

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:16.076
"the median income will likely be ..."

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:18.070
How will that compare to the mean?

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.683
Well what do they tell us about UNC?

00:01:19.683 --> 00:01:23.251
They tell us that Michael
Jordan was a geology major

00:01:23.251 --> 00:01:25.190
at the University of North Carolina.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.987
So what will the distribution

00:01:26.987 --> 00:01:28.814
of salaries probably look like?

00:01:28.814 --> 00:01:30.583
So if we're thinking
about the University of

00:01:30.583 --> 00:01:33.510
North Carolina, probably will
look something like this.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.869
And I'm going to do a
very rough distribution

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.785
right over here and let's
say that this would be

00:01:39.785 --> 00:01:44.968
a salary of 0, and let's say
that is a salary of, I don't know

00:01:44.968 --> 00:01:49.480
Let me put a salary of 50K
here, I'll do this in thousands.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.920
Let's say this is 100
thousand right over here.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.348
And then you have Michael Jordan who is,

00:01:55.348 --> 00:01:58.344
actually I'll do a little gap
here because he's so far up,

00:01:58.344 --> 00:02:00.143
I don't know exactly what he was making

00:02:00.143 --> 00:02:02.985
but it was definitely
in the tens of millions

00:02:02.985 --> 00:02:06.092
of dollars a year so Michael Jordan is

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:09.577
way, way, way, way, up here.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.883
So if you were to make a histogram or a

00:02:12.883 --> 00:02:14.788
plot of all of the salaries we could say,

00:02:14.788 --> 00:02:16.931
Okay well you know maybe
we have, if you put all

00:02:16.931 --> 00:02:19.729
of the folks from geology majors at

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:20.796
University of North Carolina...

00:02:20.796 --> 00:02:23.320
well there's probably, especially
right when they graduated

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.112
there's probably you know, 1,
2, 3, I could keep doing it.

00:02:27.112 --> 00:02:29.112
A bunch of people maybe making 50K maybe

00:02:29.112 --> 00:02:31.392
some people making a
little bit more, maybe some

00:02:31.392 --> 00:02:35.030
people up here, maybe some people there.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.741
Some people there, some people there.

00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:40.376
Right there, maybe someone's making 100K.

00:02:40.376 --> 00:02:43.480
Maybe it's a couple of people up there,

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.776
maybe someone isn't making anything,

00:02:45.776 --> 00:02:47.824
maybe they weren't able to find a job.

00:02:47.824 --> 00:02:49.296
And then of course you have Michael Jordan

00:02:49.296 --> 00:02:51.560
up here making you
know, 10 million dollars

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.861
or 20 million dollars
or something like that.

00:02:53.861 --> 00:02:55.584
So when you have a situation like this

00:02:55.584 --> 00:02:58.622
where you have this
outlier of Michael Jordan

00:02:58.622 --> 00:03:01.404
it's going to put, one
way I think about it

00:03:01.404 --> 00:03:03.813
it kind of tugs on the
mean, it wouldn't affect

00:03:03.813 --> 00:03:05.448
the median because remember the median is

00:03:05.448 --> 00:03:08.400
the middle value so it
doesn't matter how high

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.307
this number is, you can
make this a trillion dollars

00:03:11.307 --> 00:03:13.601
it's not going to change
what the middle value is.

00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:15.904
The middle value is still
going to be the same

00:03:15.904 --> 00:03:18.344
middle value, you can
move this anywhere around

00:03:18.344 --> 00:03:20.877
in this range it's not
going to change the median.

00:03:20.877 --> 00:03:23.849
But the mean will change, if
this becomes really, really

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.121
astronomically high it
will distort the actual

00:03:27.121 --> 00:03:29.285
mean here, actually could
distort it a good bit.

00:03:29.285 --> 00:03:32.689
So for geology majors
from UNC the median income

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:34.800
is going to be lower than the mean because

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.831
Michael Jordan is pulling the mean up.

00:03:37.831 --> 00:03:39.562
So let me fill that in.

00:03:39.562 --> 00:03:41.873
"So for geology majors
from UNC, the median

00:03:41.873 --> 00:03:43.945
"will be less than the mean."

00:03:43.945 --> 00:03:45.653
Now let's think about the other ones,

00:03:45.653 --> 00:03:47.873
"For civil engineering
majors from Montana,

00:03:47.873 --> 00:03:50.352
"the median income will
be" blank "the mean."

00:03:50.352 --> 00:03:53.345
Well they tell us there were
only three civil engineering

00:03:53.345 --> 00:03:55.569
majors from the University of Montana.

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.161
They all took the exact
same job at the same company

00:03:58.161 --> 00:04:00.000
earning the same salary.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.859
So let's say all 3 of them
earn 50 thousand dollars.

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:05.244
Let's say that's their salary so you have

00:04:05.244 --> 00:04:08.145
if you were to calculate
the mean it would be

00:04:08.145 --> 00:04:13.809
50 + 50 + 50 over 3 which of course is 50.

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:15.071
That would be the mean.

00:04:15.071 --> 00:04:18.623
If you wanted the median you
list the salaries in order

00:04:18.623 --> 00:04:20.649
and then you take the middle
one, well the middle one

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:25.336
is 50, so in this case the
median is equal to the mean.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.823
So let's fill that in,
median is equal to the mean.

00:04:28.823 --> 00:04:32.532
And then finally, wait let
me go back to my scratchpad.

00:04:32.532 --> 00:04:35.809
Whoops, let me go back
to my scratchpad here.

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:39.113
"For finance majors from
Wesleyan, the median income

00:04:39.113 --> 00:04:41.145
will be," blank "the mean."

00:04:41.145 --> 00:04:43.659
So let's think about
this distribution here.

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:47.313
So here we have 35, out of
the 35, 32 got high-paying

00:04:47.313 --> 00:04:51.374
consulting jobs so let's
say that they were making

00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:55.673
six-figures so the distribution might look

00:04:55.673 --> 00:05:00.351
something like this, this
is 0 and this is let's say

00:05:00.351 --> 00:05:04.618
this is 50K and let's say
that this right over here

00:05:04.618 --> 00:05:07.297
is 100 thousand dollars a years.

00:05:07.297 --> 00:05:09.606
So 32 got high-paying consulting jobs,

00:05:09.606 --> 00:05:17.113
so you might have 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

00:05:17.113 --> 00:05:24.148
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,
17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22,

00:05:24.148 --> 00:05:33.191
23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32.

00:05:33.191 --> 00:05:35.786
So the distribution for
the people who got the jobs

00:05:35.786 --> 00:05:38.245
might look something
like that but there were

00:05:38.245 --> 00:05:40.668
3 people who are unemployed
so let's say they

00:05:40.668 --> 00:05:45.028
got no income, so you have 1, 2, 3.

00:05:45.551 --> 00:05:48.426
So this is now, you have 3
outliers like the Michael

00:05:48.426 --> 00:05:50.981
Jordan situation but instead
of them being very high

00:05:50.981 --> 00:05:54.131
they are very low so they're
going to pull the mean

00:05:54.131 --> 00:05:56.737
lower, they're not going
to, if these were 0

00:05:56.737 --> 00:05:59.409
or these were 50, or these were over here,

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:01.737
they're not going to affect the median.

00:06:01.737 --> 00:06:03.804
The middle number is still
going to be the same.

00:06:03.804 --> 00:06:06.097
But they are going to pull down the mean.

00:06:06.097 --> 00:06:08.788
So here I would say that
the median income will

00:06:08.788 --> 00:06:13.466
likely be higher, will likely
be greater than the mean.

00:06:13.466 --> 00:06:15.557
Because the mean is
going to get pulled down

00:06:15.557 --> 00:06:18.431
by these outliers, these three
people not make anything.

00:06:18.431 --> 00:06:20.401
So let's fill that out.

00:06:20.401 --> 00:06:22.497
"For finance majors from
Wesleyan, the median income

00:06:22.497 --> 00:06:25.631
"will likely be greater than the mean."

00:06:25.631 --> 23:59:59.999
Now let's check our answer,
and we got it right.
