00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
As we'll see, they'll oscillate faster.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
You have to spend some time with this, but for the larger value of 0.3,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
we reach a negative value in y already here, which means we just crossed the line.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
This is just 13 steps in whereas if we were back to 0.1,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
then our step 13 would still be 0.6 off.

00:00:20.000 --> 09:59:59.000
So clearly the control oscillation is much slower, and we compensate much less
