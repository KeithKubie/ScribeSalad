00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.749
 Many of us wake up and have one thing in mind - coffee! Or at least, a drink containing caffeine 

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:09.690
 To begin his day. But what if I told you that you drank your coffee? 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.990
 Incorrectly all this period? 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.890
 All of us have an internal biological clock called the biological rhythm, which organizes many processes 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.199
 Within our bodies, including our desire to sleep during the day. As this clock 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.740
 Controls the release of a hormone called cortisol, which often refers to the stress hormone 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.099
 Because it is excreted at high rates during the body's response to the so-called "theory of" 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.180
 Cortisol secretion is also associated with your level of alert during the day. 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.620
 The highest levels of cortisol peak between 8 and 9 am. 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.890
 This means that your body has a natural mechanism to keep you awake. And while you may think that caffeine 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.660
 Unable to complete this mechanism, scientists have already found that coffee consumption 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.360
 Or energy drinks during peak production peak cortisol greatly reduces the effect of caffeine 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.610
 And increases the strength of caffeine resistance over the long term. Generally, that means you are 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.050
 I got less cheer, and need larger amounts in the future to stay alert. We analyzed addiction and resistance 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.109
 Caffeine In one of the past episodes, you can watch them 

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.829
 from here 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:13.759
 For this reason, drinking coffee after cortisol flow at 9 am may be better. Scientists 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:20.079
 They found a few other times when cortisol was also at its peak: between noon and 1 pm, and 5:30 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:24.149
 And 6:30. Which means that the best time to drink your coffee is outside these times. 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.140
 These cortisol stabilizers - and the bio-rhythm clock in general - are more organized 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.100
 By means of sunlight, that is, your sleeping schedule does not have much effect. 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.219
 So what if I woke up too early, or too late? Is it advisable to drink coffee immediately? 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:41.219
 Well, scientists have found the fact that cortisol levels are already increasing 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:46.810
 Immediately after you wake up about 50% sleep regardless of time. Science says, wait at least 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:57.239
 An hour before you start you get a cup of coffee, so your body is well prepared.
