00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.130
Great, so let's move forward and

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.600
understand where we position
ourselves among our competitors.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.109
But first we need to
analyze our competition.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.260
Now, there are four levels of market
competition which we use to assess

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.390
our competitors in the industry and
how we are placed in the industry.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.330
So, the four levels of competition
are product form, product category,

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.590
generic, and budget competition.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.440
So, let's go through this
with a tangible example.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.870
Let's take flavored water a.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.230
This is a lightly flavored
water without any added sugar.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.560
Competition at the product form level
will include products that have

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.620
the exact same features and
similar values as our product.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.555
So a competitor at the product form
level would be flavored water b.

00:00:43.555 --> 00:00:46.113
This is another flavored water,
without any added sugar,

00:00:46.113 --> 00:00:48.950
just gives you a little
extra kick to your water.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.840
Now, product form competition
is extremely narrow.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.270
We only consider products that
are actually the exact same,

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.710
just different brands.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.580
So both of these waters are flavored
waters without any added sugar,

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.700
they just are different brands.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.802
Now, product category
competition includes products

00:01:06.802 --> 00:01:11.291
with similar features but it's a little
bit of a bigger scope than product form.

00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:15.680
So an example of that would
be flavored sparkling water.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.260
Now,, this is also flavored
water that doesn't have sugar,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.930
but it's a sparkling water.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.150
So, it's a competitor
on the category level.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.487
Now ,thinking about our
flavored water example,

00:01:25.487 --> 00:01:27.122
I want you to consider your own app.

00:01:27.122 --> 00:01:28.306
Who are your competitors?

00:01:28.306 --> 00:01:31.112
Now thing about product
category competition and

00:01:31.112 --> 00:01:33.240
product form competition.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.376
What competitors do you
have in these areas?

00:01:35.376 --> 00:01:38.190
Now fill in each competitor's
name in the appropriate field.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.445
