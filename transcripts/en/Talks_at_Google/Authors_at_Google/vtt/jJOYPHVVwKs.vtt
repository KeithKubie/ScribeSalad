JOSHUA KLEIN: A little
bit of background.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.220
About 10 or 15
years ago, I started

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.670
doing IT security stuff,
eventually ended up

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.480
working with a lot of
three-letter agencies

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.320
down in DC, and started learning
about a lot of the capacity

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.000
and capabilities that we all
have recently learned about.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.270
Thank you very
much, Mr. Snowden.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.457
So seeing that come along,
as my career progressed,

00:00:24.457 --> 00:00:26.290
I started working more
with large companies,

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.170
started seeing big companies
get similar capabilities,

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.850
witnessed Google.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.330
But at the same time, from
the other side of the fence,

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.690
in IT sect., seeing people
develop new platforms

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.040
and new opportunities for
exchanging goods and services,

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.990
like drug sales or
arms deals and stuff.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.160
Fun stuff like that.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.790
So it got me thinking
what's actually

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.320
going on with commerce,
what's happening with us,

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.600
and is Bitcoin serious.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.046
Does anyone here
have any Bitcoin?

00:00:54.046 --> 00:00:55.920
It's always one of the
guys in the front row.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.500
So that's a little bit about me.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.170
So that made me ask
the question, what's

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.128
happened with commerce?

00:01:03.128 --> 00:01:05.250
And that led me to this book.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.047
So starting off, I want you
to ask yourself this question.

00:01:08.047 --> 00:01:09.130
What is your mother worth?

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.905
And the reason I want you to ask
yourself what it means to you

00:01:13.905 --> 00:01:15.530
is that I think it's
going to determine

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.000
your wealth for the
next five to 20 years.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.049
So the first way
that most people

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.090
answer this question of
what is your mother worth

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.350
is to say that your
mom is worth whatever

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.810
anybody will pay for her.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.564
Which sounds a little
naughty, but is actually,

00:01:32.564 --> 00:01:34.730
if you think about it from
a capitalist perspective,

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:35.927
pretty typical.

00:01:35.927 --> 00:01:38.260
If you're Hallmark, you might
say that your mom is worth

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.990
$1.50 because that's what it
costs for them to acquire her

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.920
as a customer in order
to buy a $5.00 card.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.884
If you run a
retirement home, you

00:01:45.884 --> 00:01:48.050
might decide if she's worth
quite a bit more because

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.924
of the amount of money
that she'll spend over

00:01:49.924 --> 00:01:51.640
the course of her
staying with you.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.520
So breaking things
down into cost

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.050
is actually a pretty
intuitive, normal way

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.569
of valuing goods,
services, and people today.

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:03.110
Now to really think
about it, we have

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.740
to consider why
money came about.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.580
And I'll keep this brief
because you're all smart people.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.940
But the basic answer
to that is that money

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.950
allows us to answer
questions of scope, scale,

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.040
and storage that we can't
do with trade, barter,

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.470
and gift alone.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.080
So if you and I live in a
small town and I'm a potter,

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.450
I can take my pots and
I can sell them to you.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.690
And if you give me some money,
I can then wait until wintertime

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.330
when I'm hungry, and then I can
go to the butcher and say OK,

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.960
now I would like
some meat instead

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.050
of going to the
butcher with a pot

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.800
and saying would you
like a pot right now,

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.240
and then you can
give me a stick.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.400
So it lets us store
our money, which

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.350
is our value, which is
really, really good.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.180
The next thing it lets
us do is scale it.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.830
So I could sell pots to
the butcher, the baker,

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.134
the candlestick maker and
save all that money up.

00:02:49.134 --> 00:02:51.550
And then at the end of the
year, I can go to the carpenter

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:52.930
and say, "Here's all this money.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.190
Give me a house."

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.487
The last thing it does is
it gives us some scope.

00:02:57.487 --> 00:02:59.445
So I can give a bunch of
pots to a merchant who

00:02:59.445 --> 00:03:01.700
would go to the next village
over where I have never

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.120
gone because that
is so far away.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.630
And he can sell those pots,
and then come back and say,

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.340
"Here's your portion of it."

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.810
So money lets us
do lots of things

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.870
which are really, really useful.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.920
Now what's interesting is that
if you fast forward to today,

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.520
we're now at a
point where we are

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.340
able to gather massive
amounts of data

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.100
and start increasing the
resolution on what people,

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.885
services, and goods are worth.

00:03:24.885 --> 00:03:26.510
Because we're able
to drive down deeper

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.730
and deeper into
the relative value.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.710
So for example, one
Amazon, if you guys

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.810
connect to amazon.com
from here and go

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.710
to buy something, some
cheese or something,

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:38.960
you'll get a certain price.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.090
If you go out to
Bushwick, you're

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.020
going to get a totally
different price because they're

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.320
going to give you
different prices based

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.770
on where your connecting into.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.034
So this is dynamic pricing.

00:03:46.034 --> 00:03:47.950
And it's not actually
very different from what

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.460
you get going to a deli here
versus a deli in Bushwick.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.450
They're going to have
different prices as well.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.640
What's interesting
is we're starting

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.380
to see that that
pricing is happening

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.480
at a more personal level.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.880
So for example, about
five years ago, Microsoft

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.330
came up with a couple patents.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.680
And we know that if
Microsoft has patents on it,

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.760
everybody else has already
been working on it.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.090
So the first patent allows
them to assign a number

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.120
to anyone's ability to influence
others around a word or topic.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.660
So again, if you have a very
popular blog about cheese,

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.690
then you might have a very
high score for the word cheese.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.440
So they'll say you have 87.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.500
On the other hand, if I've
only ever tweeted once

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.140
about being lactose
intolerant, my cheese score

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.720
might be very, very low.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.540
The second patent allows them
to dynamically price goods

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.420
and services based on the same.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.322
So if you go online to
buy some Kraft singles,

00:04:39.322 --> 00:04:40.780
Kraft might decide
that because you

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.300
are so influential around
the topic of cheese,

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.700
that they're going to
reduce your price by 50%

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.210
because if you do
buy their product,

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.751
you might say
something good about it

00:04:48.751 --> 00:04:51.190
and amortize their
marketing costs.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.236
On the other hand,
if I go to Amazon

00:04:53.236 --> 00:04:54.610
and try and buy
some cheese, they

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.276
might decide to triple the price
because I'm nothing but a media

00:04:57.276 --> 00:05:00.050
nightmare when it
comes to cheese eating.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.292
So it's interesting
that this is happening.

00:05:03.292 --> 00:05:04.750
It's essentially
the same phenomena

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.166
as we get with
Coca-Cola machines.

00:05:06.166 --> 00:05:10.070
They change their prices based
on how hot it is outside.

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.360
Except now, we're able
to do it individually

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.530
for every single person
in any given context.

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.012
So that's using big data.

00:05:18.012 --> 00:05:19.470
It's gathering all
this information

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.810
and hyper-personalizing
the pricing.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.560
What's curious is that the
same ideology of gathering data

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.060
and using it to filter down to
exactly what one person can pay

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.390
maximally for any good service
or-- we'll just call it goods

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.600
or services for -- it's starting
to filter out into the real

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.200
world.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.924
So you all know that city
buses have cameras on them.

00:05:40.924 --> 00:05:42.340
Did you know that
many of them now

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.444
have microphones that are
being put in the seats?

00:05:45.444 --> 00:05:46.860
And this, of course,
is because it

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.840
allows them to record
your conversations,

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.360
and then do speech to text, and
then do searches for keywords.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.116
So, obviously, law enforcement
has a hand in this.

00:05:55.116 --> 00:05:57.490
But at the same time, it also
makes really good marketing

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:58.340
sense.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.207
If you're looking at a
sign for an ad on the bus,

00:06:02.207 --> 00:06:04.290
they would like to know
what you're talking about.

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:07.120
And if you're using the
word or a name associated

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.200
with the brand.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.040
Similarly, we're
starting to see stuff

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.680
like infrared cameras that
are being installed in stores.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.382
So a lot of stores did this
for a while for market testing,

00:06:17.382 --> 00:06:19.590
but they're starting to be
regular installations that

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:20.311
are always there.

00:06:20.311 --> 00:06:22.560
They basically follow your
eyes and see which products

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.930
you're looking at
and for how long.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.680
And now there are new
products coming out.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.460
Like picosecond
lasers which should

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.570
be being deployed in airports
over the next couple years.

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:34.030
Picosecond lasers are
able to sample everybody

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.780
in a 50-meter radius and
determine heart rate, body

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.560
temperature, respiration,
stuff like this.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.724
It can also do-- I believe
it's spectrum analysis-- that

00:06:44.724 --> 00:06:46.890
allows them to determine
how much adrenalin you have

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:48.556
in your body or how
much caffeine you've

00:06:48.556 --> 00:06:49.857
consumed that day.

00:06:49.857 --> 00:06:51.940
So you can see that gathering
all this information

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.590
together gives someone a really
good idea of what you might

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.720
want to pay for anything
in any particular context.

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:03.110
So that makes the answer to
this question very finite.

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.970
It means we know exactly
what your mother is worth.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.810
But before money, we used
a very different system.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:17.040
We used trade, we used
barter, we used relationships

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.690
to determine how much
of something was worth.

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:23.280
We get a good or a service.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.900
So this is basically how human
brains evolved over time,

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.240
was to figure out that
you and I worked together

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.690
last summer on a project.

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:34.510
And this winter, I
bailed out your basement,

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:37.890
but you dated my sister, and
you were kind of a jerk to her.

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:42.861
And now we're going in
to trade corn for pots

00:07:42.861 --> 00:07:43.610
or whatever it is.

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:45.210
That's all going to
weigh in, and it's

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:46.780
going to be something that
we can actually figure out

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.550
in terms of exchanging value.

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:51.380
So the way I'd like
to summarize this

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:54.270
is with an anecdote
about your sister.

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:57.340
And so far we talked
about your mom.

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.700
If, for example,
you raised sheep,

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:04.250
and you had an excess of wool,
and you also had a sister,

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.820
and you'd forgotten
your sister's birthday,

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.350
but your-- and this is getting
very complicated, I'm sorry,

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:10.580
I'm telling this all wrong--.

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.820
But if you forgot your
sister's birthday,

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:14.660
and your sister had
a knitting club,

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.317
and you had an excess of wool,
then traditional economics

00:08:17.317 --> 00:08:19.400
would say that you should
take the wool to market,

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.160
sell the wool, take
that cash value,

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.250
and then give the cash
value that represented

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:28.592
the ire of your sister to
your sister to buy her off.

00:08:28.592 --> 00:08:30.300
Because you want to
use money as the most

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.456
fungible good that you have.

00:08:32.456 --> 00:08:34.039
I don't know about
you, but if I tried

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:36.570
to give my sister money
for her forgotten birthday,

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:38.147
I'd get a punch in the face.

00:08:38.147 --> 00:08:39.230
This is not going to work.

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:41.039
It's not how human beings work.

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:43.830
It's because my sister
and I have a relationship,

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:46.200
and she expects
birthday-related exchanges

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.650
to be loaded with meaning.

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:50.940
So, instead of selling
that wool on the market

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.160
and then trying to
give cash to my sister,

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.050
I could take the wool
and give it to her

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:56.650
to use with her knitting club.

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:59.227
Now, this sounds obtuse,
but if you think about it,

00:08:59.227 --> 00:09:00.810
if you're in that
situation, you would

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:06.116
have a good idea how much
wool to give to your sister.

00:09:06.116 --> 00:09:07.490
If I asked you
how much money you

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:09.323
would spend on your
sister for her birthday,

00:09:09.323 --> 00:09:11.890
you'd probably have
a pretty good idea.

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:15.690
So that ability to take all
these fuzzy bits of context

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:17.880
and stitch them
together is part of what

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.940
enables human beings
to do real exchange,

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.185
relationship-based exchange.

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:27.180
One of the reasons
that this is important

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:30.580
is that it demonstrates that
what we have that's of value

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:33.300
is not just our net worth,
not just our financial worth,

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.840
but related more
over to our net work,

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.160
the value of our net work.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:44.410
So a lot of this comes from
the pre-financial models

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:46.920
of exchange that we
are used to using,

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.140
which has some advantages.

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:50.220
So, for example,
they're richer in that

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.270
if I have an excess of pots
and you have an excess of corn,

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:54.866
but you happen to
really want pots,

00:09:54.866 --> 00:09:56.240
and I happen to
really want corn,

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.930
we can trade at better
than market rate.

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:01.880
But again, that's tempered
by our relationships.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.730
The downside with these
pre-financial models

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:05.910
of exchanges is that
they're really limited.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:07.410
That might work
with you and I if we

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:09.660
live in the same small
village, and, in fact,

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.360
that's how most
exchange evolved.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.170
But if I try and trade with
the guy in the next village,

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:16.130
who happened to wonder
over into our village

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:18.590
and swears he'll
come back next fall

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:22.090
and give me pots, or corn,
or meat, or whatever it is.

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:23.330
That's not going to happen.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:24.704
Because there's
no accountability

00:10:24.704 --> 00:10:27.132
in terms of our relationship.

00:10:27.132 --> 00:10:29.090
What's interesting about
that is that we're now

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:33.110
starting to hit what I call
the reputation economy.

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:36.080
Hence the title of the book.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.675
Which is to say that
your small village is now

00:10:38.675 --> 00:10:39.650
the entire world.

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:40.774
Welcome to the internet.

00:10:40.774 --> 00:10:42.690
You all already know
about this because you're

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:43.770
working for the internet.

00:10:45.441 --> 00:10:47.690
One of the things that's
interesting about it is we're

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:52.020
starting to see really old
models getting ported online.

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:58.370
So if I wanted to find
somebody in my neighborhood

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:00.800
that had a lawnmower
I could borrow

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.830
and who wanted to borrow
my hedge trimmers.

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:04.964
I could do that
with neighbor goods.

00:11:04.964 --> 00:11:06.880
If I wanted to find
someone who would drive me

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.260
across town without
driving into a light pole,

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.630
and do it for a cost that
I was willing to pay,

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:13.270
I can do that with Uber.

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:15.470
Depending on what happens
with New York and Uber.

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:17.910
Maybe I could do it with Uber.

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:19.897
If I wanted to find
a community of people

00:11:19.897 --> 00:11:22.230
who are interested in the
message that I wanted to share

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:24.050
and who had a message
that I wanted to share,

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:25.980
I could do that with a
service like Headliner.

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:29.180
So we're starting to find that
there are old systems, which

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.430
are basically trade and
barter, things which are based

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:33.590
on reputation or the
ability to get information

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:35.620
about somebody else
enough to assess

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.440
the relative value of a
non-financial exchange,

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:42.300
now appearing online,
This is curious

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.510
because it's letting us
do things at a new scale.

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:46.550
So for example, at
one point, I talked

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:49.610
to a student who really wanted
to get an internship at company

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:51.880
X. But he didn't know
anyone at company

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:54.575
X. So what he did is he took
his World of Warcraft account,

00:11:54.575 --> 00:11:56.970
and he loaned it to
another friend of his.

00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:01.110
And had that friend loan his
car to another friend of his

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:02.990
who wanted to take
a girl on a date.

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:05.090
And that friend
then talked his dad

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:09.380
into recommending the first guy
for an internship at company X.

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:10.330
Makes sense.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:13.246
That's what we
call "friendships."

00:12:13.246 --> 00:12:14.620
And it turns out
that it's really

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:16.497
intuitive to how
human beings operate.

00:12:16.497 --> 00:12:18.580
Well now, you can get
online and do the same thing

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:21.163
because you can find out enough
information about other people

00:12:21.163 --> 00:12:22.760
to make those connections.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.190
That system, by
the way, is really

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:26.170
similar to something
called Hawala.

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:28.200
Hawala is a method
of exchange that

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.420
came out of the Middle East
around the eighth century

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:35.400
and basically was used for
long distance value exchange.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.220
Hawala is still used today.

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:39.280
It's primarily used
by diaspora that

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.290
are sending money back home.

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:43.310
The way that it
works is, let's say

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:46.580
I wanted to send $100 to
my mom in Afghanistan.

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:47.600
Kind of difficult to do.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.060
Trade embargoes, banking
is all kind of dicey.

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.500
But I can go to the place
where I drink my tea,

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.300
I can find a Hawaladar
who is someone

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.380
who does Hawala exchange.

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:58.110
I can give them $100,
give a password,

00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:59.670
tell them where my mom is.

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:03.210
And then he connects to a
Hawaladar he knows and trusts,

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:05.040
and says, "Here's $100."

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:08.070
Or, "Here is access
to my eBay account

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:09.710
that has a really
good seller rating."

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:10.690
Or, "Here's my car.

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:11.900
Borrow it for the weekend."

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.750
Or, "Here's some
black tar heroin."

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:15.870
I don't know what it is
that they're trading.

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:18.680
But they exchange
$100 worth of value.

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:20.610
That Hawaladar then
does the same thing

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:22.170
with some other
Hawaladar he knows,

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:23.878
et cetera, et cetera,
et cetera, until it

00:13:23.878 --> 00:13:26.290
gets to Hawaladar in
Afghanistan in the village where

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:28.930
my mom lives, who goes to
my mom, and says, "Hey,

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:30.240
what's the password?"

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.890
She tells him, and
then he gives her

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:35.846
$100 or the equivalent
in local currency.

00:13:35.846 --> 00:13:37.470
Now this system has
a lot of advantages

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:39.800
because it's based on trust.

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:40.960
So it's really flexible.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.620
It's also not subject to
taxation, or trade embargoes,

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.530
or being traced.

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:48.620
So these are all very
helpful elements.

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:51.350
Interestingly, during
the 9/11 attacks,

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:53.370
the FBI was certain
the terrorists said,

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:56.770
"Use this to exchange all of
their value, " when, in fact,

00:13:56.770 --> 00:14:00.972
they had used an
FDIC-insured bank in Florida.

00:14:00.972 --> 00:14:02.430
And the reason that
this happens is

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:06.210
that no one who works
in Hawala, no Hawaladar,

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:08.480
is going to trade money for
terrorists because that's

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.150
really bad PR.

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:11.830
And when your entire
business model

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:14.290
revolves around trust,
that's not something

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:15.890
you're willing to screw with.

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:20.210
So it's not a great surprise
that Hawala as a model

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:21.440
has been ported online.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.700
So Peter Thiel recently
invested $6 million

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:25.460
in a company called
TransferWise,

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:28.900
which does exactly that.

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:32.760
So the big question
for me is why are we

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.710
starting to see all
these new systems appear?

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:36.360
Why are they happening now?

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.770
And I think there's
two main reasons.

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:41.530
The first is that
people are beginning

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:44.571
to be more interested in
meaning than in money.

00:14:44.571 --> 00:14:46.070
And by that I don't
mean that people

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:47.890
don't care about money anymore.

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:53.030
I mean that Airbnb, for example,
is growing leaps and bounds

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:54.600
over companies like Hilton.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.092
Or that car sales are
down year over year.

00:14:57.092 --> 00:14:58.550
In other words,
people are starting

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:01.960
to be interested in having
experiences or richer, fuller

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.430
lives more than
they are in status

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:08.080
symbols like a new car
or the corner office.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:11.100
At the same time, we're also
seeing the financial economy

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.830
pretty much sucking
it, and we're all

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:15.840
curious about how we
can get more leverage

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:17.310
with the resources we have.

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:18.935
And what people are
starting to realize

00:15:18.935 --> 00:15:22.660
is that they have, in fact, a
lot more value in their lives

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:23.730
than they realized.

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:25.640
So for example,
Skillshare lets you

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.290
go take that hobby that you
have and start teaching it

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:30.207
to strangers in
exchange for some cash.

00:15:30.207 --> 00:15:32.540
Or if you have a car that you
only drive on the weekend,

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:35.620
you can rent it out
during the weekday.

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:38.310
Or if you happen to be really
good at assembling Ikea

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:40.760
furniture, you can go do that,
whenever and wherever you

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:42.087
feel like, using TaskRabbit.

00:15:42.087 --> 00:15:43.920
So in other words,
there's lots of platforms

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.378
that are out there
that are letting

00:15:45.378 --> 00:15:48.550
us move elements of value that
we previously couldn't tap.

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:57.726
This is all academically
potentially interesting,

00:15:57.726 --> 00:15:59.100
except for those
people who left.

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:02.050
They didn't find it interesting
I find it super-interesting.

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:05.920
And the main reason that
it's of value to me,

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.805
is that all these traditional
models of exchange

00:16:08.805 --> 00:16:11.180
that we're talking about,
these gift-barter relationship,

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:13.960
reputation-based
models of exchange,

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.130
are currently in use today.

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:17.860
They're just
primarily used as part

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.130
of what we call
the black market.

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:22.510
And the black market
is really big.

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:23.690
It's $10 trillion.

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:26.210
The only larger
economy in the world

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:28.790
is the US economy
at $14 trillion.

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:31.400
It's growing really fast.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:34.610
By 2020, two-thirds of
all the world's workers

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:36.906
are going to be
exchanging value on it,

00:16:36.906 --> 00:16:38.530
and it's going to be
the biggest market

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:42.600
in the world in the
next 15 years or so.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:46.370
And it's also the only really,
really, truly global currency.

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:49.080
Every place that you have
a traditional currency

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.520
or a traditional market,
you have the black market.

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:53.020
So here in the US,
for example, they

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.680
estimate that one
out of every $7

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.455
is exchanged on
the black market.

00:16:57.455 --> 00:16:59.080
And if you think
about it, that doesn't

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.520
mean that everyone's
swapping heroin.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.069
It includes stuff like
paying the baby sitter,

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:07.690
or buying a cookie
at a Ren Faire,

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:10.847
or whatever it is
that you're doing.

00:17:10.847 --> 00:17:12.930
So that's the first fact,
black market really big,

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:14.089
using all these models.

00:17:14.089 --> 00:17:16.088
That's interesting, but
it gets more interesting

00:17:16.088 --> 00:17:18.780
when you consider that right now
all these platforms that we've

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:23.010
put online, the Airbnbs,
the Skillshares, the Uber,

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:26.380
the TaskRabbits, et cetera,
are currently being used only

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:29.700
by one-third of the human race.

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.890
The other two-thirds
aren't on the internet yet.

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:33.780
And those two-thirds
are the ones

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:36.870
that are mostly using these
other models of exchange.

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:40.690
So what happens when, over
the next five to 20 years,

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:42.490
two-thirds of the
human population

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:44.690
suddenly come online with
smartphones and tablets

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:46.390
and other things that are
penetrating all these emerging

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:47.182
markets.

00:17:47.182 --> 00:17:49.140
And they have value that
they want to exchange.

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:49.850
They want to buy things.

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:50.940
They want to sell things.

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:54.179
Are they going to walk down to
Citibank and open an account?

00:17:54.179 --> 00:17:56.220
I don't think that that's
what's going to happen.

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.511
I don't think that that's
going to be intuitive to them

00:17:58.511 --> 00:17:59.300
or useful to them.

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:00.758
Not least because
Citibank is going

00:18:00.758 --> 00:18:03.160
to require that they
have a steady address.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:05.760
It's going to require that they
have a social security number.

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:07.720
It's going to require that they
fill out a lot of paperwork,

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.640
that they be literate.

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.630
These are not things that
everybody in the world has.

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:14.730
But all of those people can
easily open a Bitcoin wallet.

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:16.780
They can get a square
dongle that they

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:19.155
can put onto their phone and
swipe people's credit cards.

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:29.430
So I like to call this
Capitalism's Napster Moment.

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:31.400
Basically, what we've
got is a massive amount

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:34.330
of platform-- a huge
number of platforms

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:37.030
that are starting to bubble up
that are threatening existing

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:37.840
financial models.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.820
And we all remember what
happened with Napster.

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:41.660
Shawn Fanning said,
"Here's free music.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.510
Everyone can download
all that you like."

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:45.540
And the RIAA came along
and said, "Yeah, you're

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:47.140
crapping on our business model."

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:48.910
And they shut them down.

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:51.630
And then the internet did
what the internet does.

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:55.550
It said, "Oh, we can't get free
music, and here's BitTorrent."

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:58.480
And then RIAA started shutting
down BitTorrent sites.

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:02.630
And we came up with invite-only
file sharing sites, and better

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:04.940
anonymity software,
and better crypto.

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:08.090
And this went on and on until
Apple came along, and said,

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:10.380
"OK, look, we'll
give you your song,

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:14.480
and we'll even bundle it with
a music player, and some cover

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:18.170
art, and we'll curate some songs
for you, et cetera, et cetera.

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:20.050
And we'll charge you $1
for the whole thing."

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:21.425
And a lot of people
said, "Great!

00:19:21.425 --> 00:19:22.920
That sounds really good."

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.500
But it didn't
replace music piracy.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.900
You can still go and
download music for free.

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:32.095
I hope I'm not shocking
anybody with that claim.

00:19:32.095 --> 00:19:34.220
So I think that that's
exactly what's happening now

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:36.740
with the Ubers and the
Airbnbs, et cetera.

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:39.290
A lot of these models are going
to be crushed because they

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:42.710
do threaten existing large
institutions that are heavily

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:45.520
invested in financial
models of exchange.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.250
But what's going to
come up to replace

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:51.100
them is going to be stronger,
bigger, faster, more flexible,

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:54.560
and better suited for the
two-thirds of the world's

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.720
population that are
about to come online.

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:00.210
So my question to you
guys, specifically,

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:02.070
because you're in the
business, supposedly,

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:03.980
of writing technology
for the internet,

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:07.090
is whether you are
continuing to write software

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:09.940
to develop products that
are designed to extract

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:14.770
increasingly high resolutions
of financial value from people.

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:17.205
In other words, to get
more money out of them.

00:20:17.205 --> 00:20:18.580
Or are you building
for your mom?

00:20:22.435 --> 00:20:23.480
There we go.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:24.190
Thanks very much.

00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:34.672
So that was a little bit janky.

00:20:34.672 --> 00:20:35.380
But there you go.

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:36.588
Were there are any questions?

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:43.420
I'm glad I convinced
every one of you.

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:45.660
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:47.357
So I think--

00:20:47.357 --> 00:20:49.190
JOSHUA KLEIN: Explain
your background first.

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:50.564
AUDIENCE: My name
is Michael Kim.

00:20:50.564 --> 00:20:56.120
I work in sales
doing data analytics.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:00.015
So I guess my question
is around the idea

00:21:00.015 --> 00:21:09.260
of trust plus scalability.

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:14.450
Part of me thinks
that relationships

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:16.370
require authenticity,
in a certain sense.

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:19.610
And as soon as you try to
systematize relationships

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:22.560
or give a number or a score
or something like that,

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:25.570
you somehow lose some
of that authenticity,

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:27.967
or it becomes the
system, or the man,

00:21:27.967 --> 00:21:29.300
or whatever you want to call it.

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:34.070
I see two possible solutions.

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:37.840
One is, people get used to
it and they drop their guard

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:41.390
against systematized
scalable authenticity.

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:45.860
Or maybe some new company
comes in, they figure it out.

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:48.620
They figure out that
puzzle of exactly how

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:49.800
to scale authenticity.

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:54.150
Which method do you
think is more probable,

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:56.420
or is it some other method
that I haven't thought of?

00:21:56.420 --> 00:22:00.210
JOSHUA KLEIN: You're talking
about the clout argument.

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:04.020
You have one centralized
measure of influence,

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:08.010
which is completely crap,
if you want my opinion,

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:10.380
since that's what you asked for.

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:15.390
I think that, yes, people are
able to scale authenticity,

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:17.280
depending on the value
of the transaction

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.060
that they're looking to make.

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:24.320
So I'm willing to, on very
small amounts of information

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.340
about you, determine
whether or not

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.774
to buy or sell
something to you for $5.

00:22:28.774 --> 00:22:30.940
Whether I will leave you
at home with my infant son,

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:34.500
going to require a
little more background.

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:37.310
The good news is that we're
now able to go online and get

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:41.570
lots and lots of different kinds
of contexts around individuals.

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:44.950
So whereas I could go to clout
and determine whether clout

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:48.369
thinks you're really
able to influence others,

00:22:48.369 --> 00:22:50.660
that's not going to tell me
anything about your ability

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:51.670
as a babysitter.

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:53.840
But I can go online and
look at your Facebook page,

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.506
I can look at what
you posted on Quora,,

00:22:55.506 --> 00:22:58.320
I can figure out if you put
stuff on Stack Overflow.

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:00.550
And between looking at those
different aspects of who

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:03.050
you are, get a
better idea of who

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:05.390
you're likely to be in
the context of taking

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:06.530
care of my son.

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:08.850
Does that answer
your question at all?

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:11.034
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think so.

00:23:11.034 --> 00:23:12.200
JOSHUA KLEIN: I'm surprised.

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.283
You didn't look convinced.

00:23:13.283 --> 00:23:20.880
AUDIENCE: Well, I guess that
is like a high effort endeavor.

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:27.300
And so I guess the idea of a
one-stop, not one-stop, but how

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:31.550
do you make that accessible
to everybody who maybe doesn't

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:33.120
know about the 15 hours?

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:37.380
Or in your other example of
bringing the other four billion

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:39.320
people online.

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:42.767
They don't have a full high
resolution digital persona,

00:23:42.767 --> 00:23:44.100
and they don't have all of that.

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:47.750
So how does that fit
in with that idea?

00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:50.625
JOSHUA KLEIN: And that's the
big question that many of us

00:23:50.625 --> 00:23:51.750
are trying to grapple with.

00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:57.270
For example, can
you use cryptography

00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:59.090
to authenticate
multiple accounts

00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:00.707
and aggregate them in one place?

00:24:00.707 --> 00:24:02.790
Which allows you to tie
different kinds of context

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:05.420
together, but authenticate
them as being from one user?

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:09.100
Can you do semantic analysis
to get derivative information

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:09.980
about people?

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:12.432
Can you make one system
that's so big that everyone's

00:24:12.432 --> 00:24:13.390
basically a part of it?

00:24:16.176 --> 00:24:18.050
And we don't know what
the answer to that is.

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:20.250
What seems to be the
case is that people

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:24.130
are willing to do high
value exchanges with people

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:25.730
that they've met in real life.

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:28.590
And the degree to which they'll
exchange value with people

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:31.000
that they don't
know in real life

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.250
operates on a step
function off into nothing.

00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:35.600
The difference is that over
time, the amount that people

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:38.130
are able to or willing
to exchange is rising.

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:39.354
So Airbnb, for example.

00:24:39.354 --> 00:24:41.020
When it first happened,
everyone thought

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:43.410
that this was absolutely
crack smoking.

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:46.660
And now, it seems normal.

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:48.357
AUDIENCE: I think
that makes sense.

00:24:48.357 --> 00:24:48.580
Thanks.

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:50.390
JOSHUA KLEIN: Were there
any other questions?

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:51.380
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I have one here.

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:52.129
My name is Travis.

00:24:52.129 --> 00:24:53.290
I work in video ads.

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:55.200
I was wondering,
what do you think

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:59.040
about the traditional
marketing out there?

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:02.700
How is it going to influence
how the black market is going

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:06.590
to grow in a merge over
the next five to 20 years?

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:09.460
JOSHUA KLEIN: So,
excellent question.

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:11.830
I do not have a
good answer for you

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:15.450
because it is such
a good question.

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:17.342
I think that it's
having two effects.

00:25:17.342 --> 00:25:19.550
On the one hand, people are
getting better and better

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:20.660
at ignoring advertising.

00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:25.412
As with billboards or
radio ads or anything else,

00:25:25.412 --> 00:25:27.620
people are getting pretty
skilled at tuning them out.

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:29.036
We're also getting
better software

00:25:29.036 --> 00:25:31.970
for blocking them, if it
happens to really bother you.

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:35.680
At the same time, those ads are
able to get greater and greater

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:38.050
resolution on what's
actually relevant to you.

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:43.290
So if I'm in the market for
third-party mods for my Prius,

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:46.550
getting ads for third-party
mods for my Prius is,

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:47.250
that's not bad.

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:49.708
That doesn't bother me because
I'm actually looking for it.

00:25:49.708 --> 00:25:52.200
So there's some sort of a
tension between people being

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.970
marketed to and people
looking for information.

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:57.440
So that's one aspect.

00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:01.060
The other aspect is
embodied in Facebook's

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:04.070
condescending
corporate brand page.

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:06.400
Which if you haven't seen
it, I totally recommend it.

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:10.810
Basically what they do is they
document all the misplaced ads

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:13.130
that people do on
social software.

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:15.340
All the smarmy ads are
the ones that are like,

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:21.220
come friend our cheese company
that no one really cares about.

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:23.860
And I think that
that's really the core

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:25.410
of the problem is
that lots of brands

00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:27.870
are using the traditional
marketing model of shouting

00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:30.890
at people when what people
want to have is a conversation.

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:33.720
They want value added
from participating.

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.990
And that value can be
as little as feeling

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:42.236
like they contributed some
insight to the conversation.

00:26:42.236 --> 00:26:45.107
Does that address
your question at all?

00:26:45.107 --> 00:26:45.690
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:46.190
Thank you.

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:51.250
AUDIENCE: So in
the old days, when

00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:54.980
we bought it by knowing people
and what they could do for us,

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:56.156
it was pretty simple.

00:26:56.156 --> 00:26:57.780
We didn't know that
many people, and we

00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:00.307
could keep track of whether
they were trustworthy or not.

00:27:00.307 --> 00:27:01.140
JOSHUA KLEIN: Right.

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.306
AUDIENCE: But when scaling
this to an internet scale

00:27:03.306 --> 00:27:07.320
of billions of people, you
can't know that many people.

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:10.750
So you rely on a reputation
system or something like that.

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:14.520
But all the ones we've seen,
people try to gain them,

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:17.130
often successfully.

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:20.070
Do you have thoughts on what
we can do to combat that?

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:23.710
JOSHUA KLEIN: So I like to call
this the Friendster effect.

00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:28.210
Which is to say that if you have
a system which is significantly

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:31.750
gamified, but doesn't
create any extraneous value,

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:33.460
then it will bankrupt itself.

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:35.232
So Friendster came
out, everyone's like,

00:27:35.232 --> 00:27:37.190
"Awesome, I can see how
many friends you have."

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:39.290
It very quickly
became a game where

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:42.231
everyone tried to
get as many friends

00:27:42.231 --> 00:27:44.230
as they possibly could
as quickly as they could.

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:45.910
And shortly thereafter,
everyone realized

00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:46.950
that the number of
friends that you had

00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:49.074
didn't indicate anything
except for your dedication

00:27:49.074 --> 00:27:50.716
to Friendster.

00:27:50.716 --> 00:27:52.090
And if you had
that many friends,

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:54.420
then you were staying
at home very lonely,

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:56.440
with nobody but
you and Friendster.

00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:59.836
So I think that's one
answer to the question.

00:27:59.836 --> 00:28:01.210
Which is to say,
the systems that

00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:04.460
are only measuring your
influence or your ability

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:06.070
to interact or
your relative value

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:08.650
are going to
bankrupt themselves.

00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:11.390
The second element to
it is that, as people

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:14.730
get invested in these accounts
through participation,

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:18.040
whether that be the community,
like on Stack Overflow,

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:21.580
or exchange of goods or
services like on eBay,

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:24.350
those accounts acquire value.

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:26.670
And if you make that value
somewhat transportable,

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:28.390
it just exacerbates the effect.

00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:30.400
So if I can use my
eBay seller rating

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:34.536
to then go sell on another
platform or to get a loan,

00:28:34.536 --> 00:28:36.910
there are systems that will
check your eBay seller rating

00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:39.620
and then instantly give
you a loan based on that.

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:43.910
I think you'll see people
adhering to them longer.

00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:46.200
And I understand that
it's context-dependent.

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:48.000
In this case, a
seller-buyer relationship.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.750
But I think that that
answers a little bit

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:52.520
of the question of
how portable they are.

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:54.985
Does that address the question?

00:28:54.985 --> 00:28:56.360
AUDIENCE: That's
one answer, yes.

00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:58.280
JOSHUA KLEIN: That's
one answer, yes.

00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:00.732
I'll take it.

00:29:00.732 --> 00:29:01.690
AUDIENCE: Daniel Lujan.

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:03.830
I'm an old-time computer guy.

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:12.260
Who do you think does a good job
at the reputation for commerce?

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:14.590
There are lots of people
who have got them.

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:16.640
Who's doing a good job?

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:19.030
JOSHUA KLEIN: What do
you mean by good job?

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:21.870
AUDIENCE: Well, you
mentioned EBay as seeming

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:27.660
to have something that
there's enough people invested

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:30.950
in it that it will
converge to decent value.

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:34.040
What other systems
meet that criteria?

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:37.010
JOSHUA KLEIN: It's too bad you
followed up on your question

00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:39.430
because I was going to talk
about reputation.com that's

00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:40.555
doing lots of astroturfing.

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:46.759
Who else is doing a good job?

00:29:46.759 --> 00:29:48.550
I don't really have a
good answer for that.

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:50.727
I feel like it's so
nascent right now.

00:29:50.727 --> 00:29:52.768
And most of the platforms
that are out there that

00:29:52.768 --> 00:29:55.120
are evaluating
reputation explicitly

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:58.600
are only for selling and buying.

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.180
Maybe Airbnb or Etsy.

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:03.210
Both do a pretty
good job because they

00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:06.270
are focused pretty
solely on you building up

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:07.750
your individual brand.

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:10.040
So they very, very
clearly made themselves

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:12.540
into platforms instead
of into a store.

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:15.380
And I think that that's part
of it is allowing individuals

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:19.135
to have culpability for
their own brand, which

00:30:19.135 --> 00:30:20.010
is to say themselves.

00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:25.990
Also Stack Overflow?

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:26.710
Yeah, sure.

00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:28.640
Another good example.

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:32.300
Although that has the
interesting benefit

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:35.820
of allowing you to
be pseudo anonymous.

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:37.630
Whereas with Etsy
and Airbnb, you're

00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:39.900
supposedly
representing yourself.

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:40.695
Which is curious.

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:46.207
Any other questions?

00:30:46.207 --> 00:30:47.540
AUDIENCE: Yeah, my name is Ryan.

00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:48.331
I'm in ads here.

00:30:48.331 --> 00:30:49.830
So actually, you
just said something

00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:52.330
that inspired a question that
I didn't have, but now I have.

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:56.080
So how does a non-amenity
and reputation

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:58.010
economic interrelate?

00:30:58.010 --> 00:30:59.070
JOSHUA KLEIN: Right.

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:01.460
So on the internet,
you have authenticity

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:02.980
and you have identity.

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:05.915
So identity is, I'm Josh
Klein, here's my address,

00:31:05.915 --> 00:31:07.290
here's my social
security number,

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:10.290
here's my bank account number.

00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:15.750
Authenticity is, I'm
dragonwriter 15 on Flickr,

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:17.760
and I can
cryptographically prove

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:19.540
that dragonwriter
15 on Flickr is also

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:23.130
the same guy in the toast
sculpturists of America forum

00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:25.190
who just posted about
my toast sculpture.

00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:26.910
And I can also
cryptographically prove

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:29.750
that I'm the guy was has
this Bitcoin account.

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:34.554
So that latter part,
which is "anonymous"--

00:31:34.554 --> 00:31:37.220
and I say that in quotes because
obviously with enough Metadata,

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:39.210
you can figure out
who anybody is.

00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:41.660
But that anonymity
allows me to investigate

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:46.240
in a reputation that could have
many, many different aspects.

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.700
So one of those accounts might
be an eBay seller account

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:51.770
that has a very high rating
and is very well trusted.

00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:54.410
So this means that I don't
need to know anyone's identity

00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:57.150
to find them trustworthy and
to have an exchange with them.

00:31:57.150 --> 00:31:59.490
And I think that
that's really important

00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:02.410
because online, one of
the really big benefits

00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:04.970
is the ability to
experience things using

00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:06.770
a variety of different
aspects of yourself

00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:09.250
or to employ anonymity.

00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:12.280
And it's not just because
you want to buy drugs.

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:14.640
So that ability to
use authentication

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:18.220
using stronger crypto
is an important aspect.

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:19.900
AUDIENCE: Thanks
for that answer.

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:24.280
The first question that I
had was actually about what

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:29.440
happens to traditional models of
evaluating people's worthiness

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.540
for things such as mortgages?

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:33.640
What happens to financial
scores in the future?

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:37.760
What happens to-- away from
financial domains-- what

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:41.430
happens to test scores
for getting into college?

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:43.160
JOSHUA KLEIN: That's
a good question.

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:44.785
And it ties back to
what you're talking

00:32:44.785 --> 00:32:46.330
about in terms of
gaming systems.

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:49.020
Because if you're able to
create a new account for one

00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:54.700
specified purpose, then you
can gain things more easily.

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:56.540
I don't know what
the answer is, but I

00:32:56.540 --> 00:33:00.960
think it has to do with either
restricting domain access.

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.910
So saying, hey, you can
come and participate

00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:04.834
in our college score
testing program,

00:33:04.834 --> 00:33:07.000
but we'll give you one
account, and you could use it

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.310
over a long period of time.

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:11.190
And we can evaluate at the
end, within that very specific

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:13.140
domain, whether your
participation indicates

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:16.850
that you're real or a bot, or
whether you and many friends

00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:20.690
gathered together to create the
account, et cetera, et cetera.

00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:23.400
The other aspect is
probably around the ability

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.850
to gather massive
amounts of data

00:33:24.850 --> 00:33:28.690
and do clever analysis to it to
determine whether there's truth

00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:30.450
there.

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:32.480
I don't have good examples
of either of those,

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:33.688
but that's just my intuition.

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:37.910
You're doing both mics now.

00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:38.530
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I know.

00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:39.029
This one's--

00:33:39.029 --> 00:33:40.622
JOSHUA KLEIN: I recognize you.

00:33:40.622 --> 00:33:44.140
AUDIENCE: So you had mentioned
that people are moving away

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:47.286
from measuring their life
with financial terms.

00:33:47.286 --> 00:33:48.660
You mentioned that
they're trying

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:51.205
to lead a more fulfilling life.

00:33:51.205 --> 00:33:53.910
Have you thought about anything
that's actually driving that?

00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:56.400
And is there any
other potential side

00:33:56.400 --> 00:34:01.340
effects you might see,
their effect on society?

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:02.480
JOSHUA KLEIN: Yeah.

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:04.810
So the big side effect
that I think is interesting

00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:09.480
is the demands for transparency
from large organizations.

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:11.500
And also the push back
in terms of people

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:13.900
wanting to reclaim
their privacy.

00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:15.960
Both of those are examples
of people recognizing

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:19.370
that there are non-financial
elements of value in our lives

00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:22.290
that they want to
remain in control of.

00:34:22.290 --> 00:34:25.610
Some personal data being one.

00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:33.000
In terms of people wanting to
go scuba diving in the Pacific

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.650
instead of buying a new car,
that's just financial trends

00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:41.030
that we've noticed
over time that I've

00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:43.230
got from different
marketing organizations.

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:45.250
And it seems to be
fairly pervasive.

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:47.156
Maybe it's just a trend.

00:34:47.156 --> 00:34:48.780
Personally, I think
it is a conjunction

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:51.480
of both the infinite access
to product information

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:52.820
that we have online.

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:55.909
So I know that there will always
be some new shinier, better

00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:57.605
thing than what I have.

00:34:57.605 --> 00:35:01.420
And the ability to fool myself
that this particular Amazon

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:03.540
purchase will fulfill
my life is diminished.

00:35:05.984 --> 00:35:07.400
We also have more
access than ever

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:09.200
before to the
relationships that allow

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:11.000
us to build things
that actually matter.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.700
So no matter how
lonely you are, you

00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:14.570
can still make an
OK Cupid account.

00:35:17.650 --> 00:35:19.950
By the same token,
we're starting

00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:22.810
to see stuff where
college students are going

00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:25.510
and cultivating relationships
with DJs because it gets

00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:28.090
an invite into the back of the
club when they know they can't

00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:31.780
go in the front of the club and
buy themselves VIP room access.

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:34.290
So that's leveraging of
relationships instead

00:35:34.290 --> 00:35:36.950
of leveraging finance
is because of the fact

00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:39.780
that less people
have more money.

00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:42.362
Does that answer your question?

00:35:42.362 --> 00:35:43.240
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:43.700
JOSHUA KLEIN: You guys are good.

00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:44.533
This is interesting.

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:49.990
Anything else?

00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:54.255
Because if not, I'm going
to go get some lunch.

00:35:54.255 --> 00:35:57.220
All right.

00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:58.970
AUDIENCE: You hinted
at it a couple times,

00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:02.944
but using cryptography
to validate identities.

00:36:02.944 --> 00:36:03.860
You talked about that.

00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:05.940
Do you have any
other ideas of where

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:10.160
Bitcoin is useful in
that area of validating

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:13.390
anonymous identities,
I guess you could say?

00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:15.002
JOSHUA KLEIN: Well,
the value of it

00:36:15.002 --> 00:36:17.210
is that you can have different
kinds of accounts that

00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:19.210
are linked in a variety of ways.

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:24.800
So I can have leather bitch
97 as one of my accounts,

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:29.100
and I can have the Brony's.

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:30.609
I could have a Brony account.

00:36:30.609 --> 00:36:32.400
And these two might
not play well together.

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:32.941
I don't know.

00:36:32.941 --> 00:36:34.820
I'm just grasping
at straws here.

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:37.347
But I can use both of these
accounts and keep them separate

00:36:37.347 --> 00:36:39.430
and then find ways to
transact value between them.

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:41.657
So due to the way
that Bitcoin is made,

00:36:41.657 --> 00:36:43.240
you'll see a transaction
between them,

00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:44.920
but I could use
intermediaries to try

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:46.820
and scramble that little bit.

00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:49.420
Where I think cryptography
is really interesting

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:52.350
is in allowing these
transactions to occur over

00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:55.710
a time in a trusted way
between accounts that otherwise

00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:57.530
wouldn't necessarily have trust.

00:36:57.530 --> 00:37:01.050
So we're going to leave
leather bitch alone,

00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:04.290
but the Brony account might
have established a really solid

00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:06.210
reputation And
through that decide

00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:08.920
to transact with somebody
else and determine,

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:11.680
due to their online behavior,
that they're trustworthy.

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:13.720
Bitcoin and similar
cryptographic tools

00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:15.490
allow them to then
make that exchange

00:37:15.490 --> 00:37:17.906
without ever having to recognize
that those other accounts

00:37:17.906 --> 00:37:18.912
existed.

00:37:18.912 --> 00:37:20.495
So that's one of
the-- were you asking

00:37:20.495 --> 00:37:22.270
about what the
potential value was?

00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:23.710
AUDIENCE: No, [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:29.320
JOSHUA KLEIN: Interesting
uses of crypto?

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:32.180
It's hard because
it's so atypical.

00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:36.500
PGP, which is typically used
to encourage mail-- which

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:39.610
you may have noticed in the
news is of increasing concern

00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:43.160
to some people-- that's been
around for, what, 20 years?

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:47.680
And all it takes is pressing one
button when you write an email,

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:50.850
and we can't get people to
use it to save their lives.

00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:51.380
Why is that?

00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:53.100
It's because it's
additional hassle.

00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:56.400
So I can give you other
cases where it's useful,

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:59.020
most of which will probably
be pretty apparent to you.

00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:02.120
It's just that getting people
to do it has been hard so far.

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:05.490
And whether that changes
as a result of recent,

00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:08.200
like Snowden's reports
and whatnot, or the rise

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:12.160
of these platforms
remains to be seen.

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:14.570
Is there a hand over here?

00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:15.600
No.

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:16.260
OK.

00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:17.426
Thanks very much for coming.

00:38:17.426 --> 00:38:19.020
I appreciate it.
