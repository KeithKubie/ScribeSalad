00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.640
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson:
Hello everyone.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.180
My name is Betsy Peterson.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.630
I'm the acting Director of
the Veterans History Project

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:38.250
and on behalf of the staff, I'm
going to welcome you all here today

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:47.900
and I know we have a full and jam
packed program so I'm going to try

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.820
and be as brief as I possible can.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:01:00.340 position:56%
The Veterans History Project was
founded by the United Sates Congress

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:14.400
in 2000 and its mission is very
simple and I think very powerful,

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:21.760
which is to collect, preserve and
make accessible personal account

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.010
of America's war veteran

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:32.700
so the future generations can
understand the realities of war.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.120
And today since 2000 we have over
100,000 of those personal accounts

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:45.910
in our archives and that serves
up them are on the VHP website

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.860
so I want to invite all of
you to come and listen to some

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.810
of the interviews here or go on
site and listen to them there.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.100
But we also present programs
which brings us today

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.040
and I think today's panel
is a perfect illustration

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.370
or demonstration of our
interest and desire to want

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.730
to fully explore the
realities of war.

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:14.290
Today is Posttraumatic Stress
Disorder Awareness Day and in honor

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.790
of that the VHP staff
wanted to present a panel

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.850
that explores those issues
and its impact on veterans.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.870
And so we have assembled with US
Army Staff Sergeant Karen Fears,

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.490
a wonderful panel, a veteran
survivor and military personnel,

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.050
medical doctors, individuals
who are intimately involved

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.350
with these issues here
today to discuss it.

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.650
And so without further
ado, I'm going to turn this

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.130 position:56%
over to US Army Staff Sergeant Karen
Fears who will be the moderator

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.870
and facilitator for today and
she can provide the introductions

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.340
for our panelist but welcome
to all of the panelists

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.140
and welcome to our guest.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:43.480
[ Applause ]

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.360
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: Well
good afternoon everyone.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.290
Thank you so much for
welcoming us here today.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.820
Thank you Betsy for the warm
welcome and the background

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.680
on the American Folklife Center
and the Veterans History Project

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.410
and thanks also to the staff
Andrew Huber, Lisa Taylor,

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.370
and everyone here whose
put in this event together.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.170
This is really important work
that we are all involved in.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.940
We all know that raising awareness
of PTSD is the greatest thing

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.220
that we can do to help
our fellow veterans

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.350
and those seeking assistance.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.780
I also would like to thank our
four panelists for joining us

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.440
and bringing us their
personal experiences

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.850
and expertise to this event.

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.590
I also served as a panelist
exactly two years ago today here

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.160
at the Library of Congress

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.120
and I'm truly thankful
to God for being here.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.700
As a veteran myself, who
suffers from PTSD as a result

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.710
of sexual assault in the military,
this event is truly a platform

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.970
to bring awareness of
the severity of PTSD.

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.120
And in my healing process what I
learned as one of the main concepts

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.750 position:56%
of overcoming PTSD is to confront it
first versus suffering in silence.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.830
At the VA Hospital in
Seattle, I was a tester

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.180
in this program called
"Taking Charge".

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.830
And in this program, it allowed--
it had us to relive the scenarios

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.010
of our assault while serving.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.530
It was a very difficult
and emotional program

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.970
but it was certainly one that I'm
very happy that I participated in.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.200
It helped to establish my
voice, how to set boundaries.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.450
It taught me self defense and
a platter of many deliverables

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.810
that I would not have been able to
establish if I had not participated

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.840
in a program such as this.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.510
In the research, I also discover

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.130
that over a hundred women
participated in this program.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.380
And unfortunately, this
program dissolved in 2015

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.250
because of lack of funding.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.340
This is really a disservice to
service members both men and women

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.460
because I truly feel
that the program

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.600 position:56%
like this will be very instrumental,
not only for my recovery

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.050
but the recovery of others.

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.990
Although this issue
has been identified,

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.020
there is still a tremendous
amount of work to be done

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.810
and more importantly, veterans

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.130
and their families should not
have to suffer in silence.

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.950
This is an-- this is
not an invisible issue.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.300
It is the issue that all of us
should feel comfortable in speaking

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.280
about openly, via family,
professionals and fellow beings

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.470
and not be judged by the illness.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.630 position:56%
So with that being said I would like
to share a few house keeping items.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.650
This event is being recorded

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.200
and web-casted via the
Veterans History Project webpage

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.270
and if you enjoy the discussion,
your friends and family can view it

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:32.030
at www.loc.gov as it is the
Library of Congress website.

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.990
The panelists serving today are
professional experts in their field

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.290
and can provide a wealth

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.570
of information afterwards
via business card, brochures

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.520
or actually just interacting
with them.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.870 position:56%
Each panelist would be presented two
minutes to provide their overview

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.490
of themselves, their services and
lead into discussion thereafter.

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.910 position:56%
In keeping track of time, I will use
my tap on the imaginary watch wrist

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.260
on wrist as a timer [laughter].

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:03.470
OK. We would also like to conduct
a Q&amp;A session and we will try

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.280
to answer as many questions as
possible and if we happen to run

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.020
out of time, please
leave your questions

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.440
with the LOC staff for follow up.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.970
We would like to render the
opportunity for everyone to speak.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.090
At the end of this event, there
is a resource table in the back

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.700
that has the Veterans History
Project information and the--

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:29.630 position:56%
and "How to Conduct Military Service
Interviews with the Veterans and How

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.910
to participate in their Mission".

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.160
So in my opinion, this is a
great day for us to come together

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.130
and speak about this issue.

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.430
And at this time, I would

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.960
like to welcome the 2016 National
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:49.380
Awareness panelist and we will
start with Dr. Glenda Wrenn Gordon,

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:56.860
Dr. Tara Galovski, Dr. Elspeth
Ritchie and Maurice DeCaul.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.140
So we'll start with Glenda.

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.090
&gt;&gt; Glenda Wrenn: Well
good afternoon everyone.

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.050
I'm really delighted to be
here today and very glad

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:07.940
to have the opportunity to join
this discussion, share my insights

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.820
with you and hear the
questions that you may have.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:15.330 position:56%
I come from Atlanta here today
where I work at the Morehouse School

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.670
of Medicine a faculty member in
the Department of Psychiatry.

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:21.710
In that capacity, I direct the
Division of Behavioral Health

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:24.070
at the Satcher Health
Leadership Institute

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:26.480
under the founding
director leadership

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.490
of the 16th Surgeon
General Dr. David Satcher.

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.530
I also serve as the
Co-Director of the Kennedy Center

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:36.290
for Mental Health Policy and
Research that was recently endowed

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:39.720
with support from The Kennedy
Forum and Patrick Kennedy.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.840
So I have some aspects of
health policy perspectives

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.480
that I hope we can bring
to the discussion today.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:49.100
I'm also a veteran, a woman
veteran, and have the pleasure

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:52.540
of starting the Women's Center
of Excellence at Fort McPherson

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.120
at the Atlanta VA which
is a interdisciplinary,

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:59.520
interprofessional clinic that is
amazing and designed to address

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.800
that gap in the VA's ability
to serve women veterans

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.690
and their unique needs, so I have
a lot of insights for my work

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:11.150
with patients like yourself
who I have the great honor

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:14.310
of helping walk them through
their journey of recovery

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:16.410
and just look forward
to the discussion today.

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:17.710
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: Wonderful.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:19.010
Thank you.

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:20.310
Welcome. OK.

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:21.610
Ms. Galovski.

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:22.910
&gt;&gt; Tara Galovski: Hello,
I'm Tara Galovski

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:24.210
and I'm also delighted to be here.

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:27.180 position:56%
It really is an honor and a
privilege to be sitting at the table

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.900
with such esteemed colleagues.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:33.170
I am the Director of the
Women's Health Sciences Division

00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:35.500
for the National Center for PTSD.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:40.040
That's located in Boston, so I
flew in this morning as well.

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.500
We can share a cab going back.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:46.920
And I'm also an Associate
Professor at Boston University.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:52.670
I joined the VA fairly recently
actually, within the last 10 months

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:56.180
but I've been a contractor
with the VA for many years

00:08:56.180 --> 00:09:00.580
and my former position as
a professor in Saint Luis

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:03.850
where I also directed the
Center for Trauma Recovery.

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:06.560
And my research program
there is developing

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.780
and testing interventions
specifically designed

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:13.990 position:56%
to treat posttraumatic stress
disorder namely cognitive processing

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:19.500
therapy and I've brought those
interests with me now to the VA

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:23.850
where it's truly is an honor and
pleasure to serve our veterans.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:25.150
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: OK.

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:26.450
Thank you ma'am, thank you so much.

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:27.750
Thank you for joining us.

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.050
And Dr. Ritchie.

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:30.350
&gt;&gt; Elspeth Cameron
Ritchie: Good morning.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:31.650
It's a real pleasure to be here.

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:32.950
I am local.

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:36.590
I grew up in DC and I came to the
Library of Congress many times

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:40.050
as a child and it's wonderful
to be back here again.

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:42.300
I joined the army because they paid

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:45.070
for medical school
at George Washington.

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:48.520
Growing up in DC your local
medical school, Georgetown, GW,

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.800
Howard are pretty expensive.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.740
Best decision I made in my
life, I trained at Walter Reed.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:56.810
I was just going to
do my time and get out

00:09:56.810 --> 00:10:00.350
but the army kept me sending me
more and more interesting places,

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:07.040
Somalia, Guantanamo Bay, Korea,
Iraq and I happen to like travel.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.820
And then I retired
in 2010 as a colonel,

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:12.010
so yes you can call me Colonel
Ritchie I like the title.

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:13.470
[ Laughter ]

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:18.150
And about seven months ago I
joined our local Washington DC.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:20.680
VA. I sort of joked I
went to the dark side.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:24.610 position:56%
The VA has gotten so many hits on it
I figured I had to do something to,

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:26.210
you know, improve the system.

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:27.590
And I actually really like it,

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:30.590
really good people and
people trying hard.

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:33.040
So, I probably have
the shortest ride here.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.670
I don't know about you but I'm
a taxi ride of a few minutes.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:41.020
My other claim to fame is my great
grandmother taught James Billington

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:43.780
the history and of the
Library of Congress Russian

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:46.010
and so that's how he got
to where he is today.

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:47.410
[ Laughter ]

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:48.710
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: OK, wow.

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:50.010
Thank you.

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:51.310
Welcome. And Mr. DeCaul.

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:52.610
&gt;&gt; Maurice DeCaul: Hi everyone.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:53.910
It's a pleasure to be here
with you today and pleasure

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:55.210
to be with my other panelist.

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:56.510
So thank you for having me.

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:59.620
So I joined the Marine
Corps in 1997.

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:02.950
I was a artilleryman and
then infantryman based

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:06.440
out of Camp Lejeune, North
Carolina so not too far from here.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.830
I'm actually-- let me move this.

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:11.160
I'm actually from New York so I
took the bus down this morning,

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.270
bought a ticket a week
too late for the train.

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:17.640
But what I do, I'm a writer, so
I'm a poet and I'm playwright.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.970
And I came to writing completely

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:24.560
by accident a few years
ago back in 2009.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.630
And I was at Columbia, it's
where I did my undergrad

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:28.740 position:56%
and the intent was to study history.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:30.040
I want to be a lawyer.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:33.190
And when we were waiting for the
new GI Bill to come into place,

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:36.680
I took the year off and found a
writing workshop at NYU and it kind

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.470 position:56%
of changed the direction of my life.

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:41.580
Now, those workshops are
not necessarily designed

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:44.060
to be a therapy they're not
supposed to be therapeutic.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.660
It supposed to be professional
level workshops but I do know

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:49.470
that people receive
therapeutic value from them.

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:52.080
So currently, I am the
Artist-in-Residence

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.570
at Theatre Communications Group.

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:57.560
We are the largest theatre service
organization in the United States

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:01.050
and we represent about
770 theatres or so.

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:03.460
And we're prototyping a
program called the Veterans

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:04.760
and Theatre Institute.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:07.990
What we were hoping to
do is to expand theatre,

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:11.110
to make it more accessible
to veterans, to build demand

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:14.050
for theatre and military
and veteran's communities.

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:17.660
Writing workshops, acting workshops
and we're actually figuring out now

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.140
but a little bit of
workforce development as well.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:21.440
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: Great.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.740
Thank you.

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:24.700
Thank you all for being
here and joining us today.

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:28.500
All right, so Dr. Galovski
we're going to start with you.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:29.800
&gt;&gt; Tara Galovski: Sure.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.100
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: OK.

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.840
What has been your experience at
working with women veterans rebuild

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:37.400
in terms of challenges and
successes that remain today?

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:38.700
&gt;&gt; Tara Galovski: That's
a great question.

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.530
I'll start with successes.

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:42.330
I'll start at that top.

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:46.430
I have seen, men and women,

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:49.510
but women veteran's
lives remarkably change.

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:55.410
I look at posttraumatic stress
disorder very much as something

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:59.200
that does not need to
be on someone's plate.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:03.350
And we can't change what
happened to any given individual,

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:07.880
that is for sure, but we certainly
can take off that PTSD piece of it

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.180
and I've seen that happened.

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:12.490
I'm a psychologist as well.

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:15.450
I always keep a patient load.

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:18.350
I really enjoy working
with patients and it truly,

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:22.410
truly can remarkably
change people's lives.

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:25.860
The challenges are substantial.

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.970
Coming into therapy
is very expensive.

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:33.110
Therapy is expensive in terms
of cost but it's also expensive

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:38.270
in terms of your emotions and
the time and the logistics.

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:43.020
It's a process and so
I very much respect all

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.610
of our patient's decisions
whether or not they want to engage

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:48.770
in that process but
the challenges are

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:52.570 position:56%
to increase the access to good care.

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:53.870
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: Great.

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:55.170
Thank you.

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:56.470
Thank you so much.

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:59.270
OK. And Dr. Wrenn, in
your professional opinion,

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:03.700
what would you suggest is the most
compounding women health issue

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:06.730
and particularly present
now that combat jobs are

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:09.370
in the military that
are open to us now?

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:13.980 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Glenda Wrenn: That's a really
big question but I think I'll answer

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:16.600
that by referring to
some recent events.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.650
I don't know if any of you
followed the news and learned

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:24.260
about the womens who graduated from
ranger school in this past year.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.890
One of those women is Lisa Jaster
who's a 2000 West Point graduate

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:32.280
so that was one year behind
me and she's actually a mother

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.910
when she graduated
from ranger school.

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:38.800
So I think for all of the years
in which those debates raged

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:42.130
on about whether or not
women were capable of serving

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:45.730
in the combat arms I think that
the tide has certainly changed

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:50.450
which is wonderful but also
brings a new wave of challenges

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:55.230
and taking care of veterans in the
VA it's clear that the Department

00:14:55.230 --> 00:15:00.560
of Defense and military still has
active work that needs to happen

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:05.960 position:56%
to create a culture where all people
are respected, where there is kind

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:11.180
of an intolerance to some of the
environmental factors that lead

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:14.570
to military sexual trauma
being unacceptable outcome

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:16.070
of serving together.

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:19.720
So I think that's really important
just on the front end to make sure

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.470
that the military is an environment

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:25.520
that doesn't unnecessarily add
additional trauma exposures.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:28.690
But the other thing that I
think is important, which is,

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:32.730
both a women's health issue but
also a broader issue is military

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:34.290
cultural competence.

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:37.860
People often talk about that gap
between people that have served

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:41.900
in the military and those that just
have no understanding and I think

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:45.200
as a healthcare provider, we have
a responsibility if we're going

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.250
to take care of veterans which is
probably most healthcare providers

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:49.610
whether you know it or not.

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:51.830
There's a responsibility
to know something

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:56.890
about their culture identity, both
racial and ethnic but also how much

00:15:56.890 --> 00:16:00.560
to what extent do they connect
with their military identity.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:03.110
And I think, you know, coming
from Morehouse School of Medicine,

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:05.070
we talk a lot about
culture competence

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:08.710
and I view military culture
competence as a unrecognized aspect

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:11.490
that we really need to do more of.

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:15.760 position:56%
And that will help women as they
try to navigate their own identities

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.720
as they're out of the military,
in the military because it has

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.850
to be understood in the context
of to what extent they connect

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:23.270
with that military identity.

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:24.570
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: OK.

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:25.870
Wonderful, great.

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:27.820
Thank you.

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:32.780
OK. Dr. Ritchie, clearly,
we as women are capable

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.870
of being very resilient
while serving in combat.

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:39.470
Now that we are serving in
combat roles, what do you pose

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:41.680
as to why there is
diverted attention

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.510
to better off military
women in that environment

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:46.450
and why is that not a priority?

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:48.970
&gt;&gt; Elspeth Cameron Ritchie: So,
first of all, I want to clear

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:51.710
up one misconception that
many people have, not--

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:53.960
maybe not this audience and that is

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:58.160
that women have only recently
been allowed to serve in combat.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:01.020
Women have been in
combat for a long time.

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:04.830
I myself are allowed to wear
three different combat patches

00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:07.390
from Somalia and Iraq.

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:11.740 position:56%
What is true is that we haven't been
allowed to serve in certain roles

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:15.030
such as infantry and artillery

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:18.330
and so that's going to
be a bit of a change.

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:22.500
One of the ways I got interested
in this whole topic of women

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:26.610
in the military is I went from sort
of a cush residency of Walter Reed,

00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:30.400
where I lived, you know, in DC
and had bathrooms and, you know,

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.440
here bathrooms becomes a recurrent
theme when you're in the field.

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.980
And then I went and was
the division psychiatrist

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:41.720
for the second infantry division
on the DMC in Korea, hooah.

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.070
And shortly after I got there,

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:47.790
Saddam Hussein invaded
Kuwait four days later.

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:51.670
So we went to being
kind of, you know,

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:54.430
comfortable in DC to
being on the DMC.

00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:58.190 position:56%
So all the worries about North Korea
coming down and then the question

00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:01.790
about we're fighting another war.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:05.870
In that time, I was out in
the field a lot, team spirit,

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:11.960
cold when the winds come down from
the plains, from the Russian steps,

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:15.710
muddy, you're out in little
pop tent, kind of miserable.

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:17.810
And that's where the
bathroom thing comes in.

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:22.410
Because you're all to dress to
the ninth with your Kevlar vest

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:26.560
and your helmet and your gas mask
and your TA 50 and, excuse me,

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.860
I know you're not going to squirm
here but some of the other guys

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:30.770
in here may squirm
I warn you in this.

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:32.550
You know, when we go
to the bathroom,

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:33.850
we have to take all of that off.

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:35.150
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: We do.

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:36.450
[ Laughter ]

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:37.750
&gt;&gt; Elspeth Cameron
Ritchie: Plus CM 16.

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:39.050
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: Yes.

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:40.350
&gt;&gt; Elspeth Cameron Ritchie: And
we have to find a place to put it.

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:42.190
And you can't just leave
your M-16 on the hanging

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:45.210
out on the porta-patty, you
know, the people might want

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:47.680
to teach you a lesson or
sell it or whatever else.

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:51.960 position:56%
So what I learned back then is that
women really didn't want to complain

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.420
about any of them because we
want to show that we can hang.

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:55.720
We're tough, we're strong.

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.020
We're not going to whine--

00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:58.320
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: Yes, it's true.

00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.620
&gt;&gt; Elspeth Cameron
Ritchie: -- not me.

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:03.490 position:56%
And yet it was an additional burden
and shortening the whole discussion,

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:06.470
through the years, I've learned
that we are at higher risk

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:10.840
for urinary track infections,
for pelvic stress fractures,

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:15.610
how do you manage your menses when
you're in a deployed situation,

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:17.830
all that, all of the
embarrassing stuff

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:19.800
that people don't want
to talk about.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:23.530
Now the military to its credit
did focus on this area back

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:27.440
in the late 1990s and there was
a lot of research being done.

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:31.830
And then what happened, 9/11
happened and everybody went to war,

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:35.450
first in Afghanistan and then
in Iraq and got real busy

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:39.320
and women's issue kind of
went to the back burner.

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:41.470
Besides if they need
a decent bathroom,

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:44.500
do we really need them
in the military anyway?

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:47.730
And again, there was the cycle
of women didn't want to complain

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:52.310
and we-- because we were worried
we wanted to prove them ourselves.

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:54.630
But what the military has
also learned and this is

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:58.920
at the highest level so I believe
is we need women in our ranks.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:03.070
We need them to do it right and
so interest has come up again.

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:05.970
Having said that one of my
co-authors of a book I did "Women

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:09.880
at War" in Afghanistan in
2001 looked at the same issues

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:12.260
that I complained about
in Korea and found

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:14.180 position:56%
that they were still active 10 years

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:19.190
after we've invaded Afghanistan
people not having clean places.

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:22.440
So it is still an issue now.

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:25.610
The nice thing about the formal
recognition of women being

00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:28.970
in combat is that there's a
little more attention paid

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:30.270
to women's needs.

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:33.540
And by the way this isn't
just about women as well.

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:39.340
I find that most men over about 40
like to have a decent bathroom too.

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:43.750
And joking aside, what the
military has been very good

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:47.960
at times is integration, they've
been a leader in integration,

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.480
they've been slower
on women's rights

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.450
and they've been slower
on gay rights.

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:57.070
But now we've taken great
steps forward in the repeal

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:58.970
of don't ask don't
tell moving forward

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:01.380
in just the last couple years,

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:04.470
and I think the next step
is transgender issues.

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:09.790
And recognition that everybody
is important and people who want

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:12.280
to join the military are
raising their hand and saying,

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:15.640
"I would do whatever it takes
to take care of my country."

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:18.750
And that is a breed of person
we really want to support.

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:20.050
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: Great, great.

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:22.490
Thank you Dr. Galovsk.

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:26.840
OK. And Mr. DeCau,
OK, in March 2016,

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.540
the Theater Communications
Group launched the Veterans

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:33.930
and Theatre Institute which is
a pilot program for veterans

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:38.890 position:56%
and active military personnel to
experience study and create theater.

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:43.450
In your experience, how has a
pilot program such as this assisted

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:48.140
in a veteran in their
healing process in PTSD?

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:50.690
&gt;&gt; Maurice DeCaul: So VTI is
brand new and we're not going

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:54.480
to a running size until
September 7th of this year

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.250
in Providence, Rhode Island.

00:21:56.250 --> 00:22:00.100
But these sorts of
workshops already exist.

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:03.150
So I come from New York and in New
York we have about five of them,

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:08.010
so NYU has one, Fordham has one,
Colombia has one, and there are few

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:10.940
that are not affiliated
with the institutions.

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:15.560
What I've seen as a
participant and also as teacher

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:20.020
in these workshops is, you know,
folks come in and what ends

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:23.690
up happening is a community spill
because oftentimes the people

00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:26.320
in the room, they don't know each
other they didn't serve together,

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:28.650
different branches,
different wars even.

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:32.020
And by that, I mean, one of
my workshops we had a Marine

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:33.420
who served in the Korean War.

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:35.500
So it's multi generation.

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:40.340 position:56%
So the community gets spilled in the
room, first, and I also have noticed

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:42.260
that there was a moment
of catharsis.

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:46.030 position:56%
You know, the one at NYU the way
that we ran that one, we ran it just

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:47.900
like you would run any
other MFA style program.

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:50.870
So, the writers were
expected to write beforehand,

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:53.580
didn't really have much time to
write in class, and bring the work

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:55.870 position:56%
in and we would discuss it in class.

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:57.480
And we would offer feedback
and they would go back

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.570
and work on their pieces.

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:03.560
But in the beginning of that
workshop, and again even

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:08.890
at Colombia, what you notice, what
I notice is that there was this--

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:12.590
I would say a few months maybe
a year because of programs one

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:15.710
of the academic year where people
are going through the moment

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:20.000
of catharsis where the stories that
are coming out are the war stories

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.630
and these, you know,
these sorts of things

00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:24.070
that one never really talks about.

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:28.460 position:56%
On my way down this morning, I was
a reading I finished the book of one

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:30.420
of my friends his name is
Eric Fair [assumed spelling].

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:33.680
Eric was an interrogator in Iraq.

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:36.130
And there are things in
that book that I, you know,

00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:38.700
never knew about Eric because
he never shared them with us.

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:41.690 position:56%
But towards the end of the book he
talks about our program and he talks

00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:45.850
about the program being the place
where he was able to start thinking

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:51.340 position:56%
through some of his Iraq trauma
experience, if want to term it that.

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:56.870 position:56%
So the workshops give the space
for, you know, for us address some--

00:23:56.870 --> 00:24:01.730
you know, the issues that I think
bring-- that follow people home.

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:04.610
But after those two phases the
next phase is it becomes very

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:08.090 position:56%
professional and people begin to act

00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:10.440
and produce work like
any other writer.

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:13.280
By that I mean, you know, we've had
novels come out of those workshops.

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:14.880
We've had books in poetry.

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.450
We've turned up many journalists.

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:19.980
So, you know, there are these
phases that I'm noticing.

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:21.280
Again, I'll just repeat it.

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:22.760
The first the community building

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:24.980
and then second is a
moment of catharsis.

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:27.770
And then after that becomes
very professional people

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:30.080
who write like writers.

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:31.380
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: OK.

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:32.680
&gt;&gt; Maurice DeCaul: And I'm
hoping that we have the same sort

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:37.030
of outcomes with theater,
the programs

00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:39.730
and describing a pros
based and poetry based.

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:41.030
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: OK.

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:42.330
Wonderful.

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:45.580
Great. Thank you panel so much for
the first round of our questions.

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:48.860
The second round we're going
to go into group discussion.

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:52.660
OK. And just feel free
whomever would like to take

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:55.200
on the question just
feel free to do this.

00:24:55.200 --> 00:25:00.650
OK. A recent study pointed out
higher rates of PTSD among veterans

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:04.700 position:56%
who are women along with other
studies that show the same for Back,

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:07.190
Hispanic and Native American.

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:09.720
Why are these findings important?

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:14.840
And is research being conducted
to determine how to combat this.

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:16.280
&gt;&gt; Elspeth Cameron Ritchie: I think
at least three of us are going

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.110
to leap in to answer that one.

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:19.910 position:56%
Why don't I start and I'll be brief.

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:21.210
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: OK.

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:22.510
&gt;&gt; Elspeth Cameron Ritchie:

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:25.900
So in the civilian world PTSD
is higher among women than men.

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:29.350
In the military there's only
limited studies that have been done

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:31.970
which show that it's
about the same rate.

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:33.980
This is when people
are in active duty.

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:37.380
It changes when you become a
veteran different populations go

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:39.840
to the VA the rates changes.

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:44.890 position:56%
And so the other part of PTSD that's
very different is traditionally

00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:47.550
in women who have suffered
sexual assault.

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:49.920
That's a tremendous insult.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:53.140
It will cause often very bad PTSD.

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:55.390
Woman feels vulnerable, ashamed.

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:58.730
Well if, you know, in combat you
usually have your buddies with you,

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:01.930
you've got your weapons, you
know what you're getting into,

00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:06.760
so you certainly have PTSD but it's
not a shaming in the experience.

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:08.480
Again I'll stop there,
there's more I could say

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.690
but I know these guys
want to jump in.

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:12.000
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: OK, Dr. Wrenn?

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.660
&gt;&gt; Glenda Wrenn: I just want to
add to a point that you brought

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:16.730
up earlier which is the
challenge that people have

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:20.640
in actually identifying what there
symptoms are and what they mean

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:24.850
and then what their decisions
making process is in getting help.

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:28.140
And so I think the data that you're
showing these disparities really

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:31.460
reflect the community and the
cultural differences in terms

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:34.670
of does your social environment
promote identification

00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:38.430
of the disorder and promote
and support help seeking

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:42.420 position:56%
or when you disclose that you were
sexually assaulted does everyone act

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:45.510
like, you know, look around like
why is that a big deal again?

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:47.730
So I think that really is
important and there are

00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:50.790
so much more that communities
can do.

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:53.290
Because we put a lot on
the shoulders of those

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:55.550
that have PTSD to get help.

00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:57.130
But it's really hard.

00:26:57.130 --> 00:26:59.660
It's hard to figure out that
this is what is going on with me.

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:02.080
People just think something
bad happened.

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:04.060
My symptoms are equal to my trauma.

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:07.010
I don't, you know, what
more is there to say.

00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:09.320
So by understanding
the signs and symptoms

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:13.010
and recognizing hidden trauma
narratives that you see in others

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:16.100
that you care about you can
play a really instrumental role

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:18.580
in helping them to get to care.

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:19.880
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: OK.

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:21.180
Great. Thank you.

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:24.050
&gt;&gt; Tara Galovski: And just to
highlight the unit cohesion piece

00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:26.680
of both of those the culture

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:31.870
that a trauma occurs
in is really important.

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:36.400
And if military sexual trauma
is onboard then there's a

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.930
larger context.

00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:43.100
So a recent patient of mine
was describing a situation

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:44.750
where she is over in Afghanistan.

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:47.350
She is the only woman in the unit,

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:52.490
they all experience horrific
combat related trauma.

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:56.860
But she also had this
isolative piece around her

00:27:56.860 --> 00:28:00.740
that she couldn't share
with her unit

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:05.090
because there is the
sexual harassment component

00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:08.760
that feels very different when
you can't go home from that.

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:10.900
It's bad enough in the
workplace here in the states

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:14.240
but if you can't go home
from that plus the horrors

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:17.560
of war surrounding it there's
an added traumatic stress burden

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:19.990
for women that can be very unique.

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:21.290
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: Great, great.

00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:22.590
Thank you.

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:23.890
Thank you.

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:27.210
OK. So my next question is how
is cognitive processing therapy

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:29.590
currently used in the
treatment if PTSD,

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:34.820
and in your opinion is it
the most effective treatment?

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:36.280
Dr. Ritchie?

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:39.470
&gt;&gt; Elspeth Cameron Ritchie:
Well I am a heretic here.

00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:42.380
I don't like cognitive
processing therapy.

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:44.820
So we may have a bit
of a discussion here.

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:47.590
The cognitive processing therapy

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:50.470
and prolonged exposure are
what are called evidence-based.

00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:54.490
They've been studied in research
trials and if somebody starts them

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:58.180
and finishes them,
most people do better.

00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:01.890
The problem is a whole lot
of people don't want to go

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:04.850
through the 10, 12,
20 sessions needed.

00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:08.270
They don't want to be telling the
trauma over and over especially

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:11.240
to somebody who hasn't
been there, doesn't get it.

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:14.800 position:56%
Now there are strategies to overcome
that and one of the big ones

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:17.430
and I don't think I even
mentioned yes I'm a psychiatrist.

00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:20.110
One of the big ones is
engagement with your patient

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:22.860
and making sure they're
ready to get there.

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:25.330
You're going to I think we're going
to talk later about complimentary

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:29.290
and alternative therapies
and I use a lot of those

00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:32.200
and I'm a psychiatrist
so I use medication too.

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:35.310 position:56%
But having said that I think CBT PE,

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:37.420
cognitive processing
therapy prolonged exposure,

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:39.390
do work for some people.

00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:42.400
You just have to tailor
the treatment for them.

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:46.190
You can't just say, you know, go do
20 sessions of talking about this

00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:48.830
because a lot of people
would just walk away.

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:50.130
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: OK.

00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:51.430
And what are your thoughts?

00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:54.010
&gt;&gt; Tara Galovski: I agree
with that to some extent--

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:55.330
[ Laughter ]

00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:58.480
-- as one of the developers of
cognitive processing therapy.

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:04.300
So my area of research is to
how much can we take this manual

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:06.990
and bend it until it breaks.

00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:12.690
So I absolutely agree that if you
approach these therapies as it

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:18.800
in this cookbook kind of way then
in this absolutely less effective.

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:22.370
And I also absolutely agree
that is not a silver bullet.

00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:24.400
This is not-- you know,
that there is many people

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.610
that this doesn't happen.

00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:31.030
I really appreciate
the many pass to Rome

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:37.060 position:56%
and I very much appreciate a patient
saying to me this isn't my cup

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:38.950
of tea or I'm not ready yet.

00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:43.530 position:56%
That being said I'll do back flip in
the office to try not to in any way,

00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:45.900
shape or form collude
with that avoidance.

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:49.140 position:56%
And so I think that that might be
consistent with the engagement piece

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:52.510
that you're talking
about because I do--

00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:57.680
it's been my clinical and
academic experience that avoiding

00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:01.370
that trauma memory which sounds
really good on paper, right?

00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:04.320
Why think about the worst thing
that ever happened to you?

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:07.430
But it also keeps people
locked in PTSD.

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:11.170
So cognitive processing therapy,
prolonged exposure, acupuncture

00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:14.780
or EMT, there's evidence for
all of these things to work.

00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:16.400
And that's a great place to be.

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.120
We have lots and lots of choices.

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:19.420
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: OK.

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:20.720
&gt;&gt; Glenda Wrenn: Yeah.

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:22.020
I mean having trained
under NFO [phonetic],

00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:24.830
the PE as a psychiatry
resident I actually one

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:28.080
of my first research projects
was around dropout for PTSD

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:31.540
because I was kind of compelled
by that same finding particular

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:33.280
in African American women.

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:36.610 position:56%
And working in primary care settings
which is the clinic that we're

00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:39.280
at is primarily primary care.

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:42.670
There is a pretty extensive
engagement processes necessary

00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:44.010
for some people.

00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:45.310
And for me being trained

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:47.710
in a different psychological
modalities it helps

00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:51.360
because I can kind of give you
a preview of what to expect.

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:54.430
I can give you the rationale
for treatment and way it works.

00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:58.650
I can talk about the neurobiology
of PTSD and why avoidance is bad

00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:01.480
and why talking about the
trauma leads to habituation.

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:04.190
Not every psychiatrist can talk
through all of that and I think

00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:06.420
that kind of makes it
hard to like go over there

00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:09.800
to the trauma recovery program and
they'll do something to help you.

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.220
So I think, you know,
that's the piece

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:14.840
that Colonel Ritchie was
talking about, about engagement.

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:17.580
And I don't know that we
know enough about what works

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:20.140
for everyone here and there.

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:24.010
I kind of trust individuals to
figure out what they're ready for

00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:26.020
and our job is to kind
to give them information,

00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:27.870
maybe you haven't considered this,

00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:30.030
I think medications
are really important

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:33.450
but I tell patients I don't even
know that I've ever treated someone

00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:35.820
that go all the way better
only with medications.

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:37.210
They did something else too.

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:39.980
You have to reclaim your
natural inheritance originally

00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:42.120
and so you have to
engage back in your life

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:43.910
and medication isn't
going to do that.

00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:45.640
&gt;&gt; Elspeth Cameron Ritchie: So
I think one area we all agree

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:48.720
on then is that we've got to layout
the different options and we've got

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.850
to make sure that it
fits for that person

00:32:51.850 --> 00:32:53.670
and at the pace they're ready for.

00:32:53.670 --> 00:32:54.970
&gt;&gt; Glenda Wrenn: That's right.

00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:56.270
Yeah. OK.

00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:58.930
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: And
saying that in my experience

00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:02.460 position:56%
that was the one thing that I
wanted to avoid was having to depend

00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:06.980
on a medication for the rest of
my life to function, so thank you.

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:09.700
&gt;&gt; Maurice DeCaul: Can
I just want to-- OK.

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:11.000
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: Absolutely.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.300
&gt;&gt; Maurice DeCaul: So I've
never actually done that,

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:13.600
that sort of therapy.

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.950
I've actually not done
any of those things.

00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:18.100
And I remember speaking
with a friend

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:21.310
of mine a poet Vietnam air
poet, very well known poet

00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:22.610
so I'm not going to use his name.

00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:24.670 position:56%
But he was taking about when he goes

00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:28.450
to the VA he undergoes
the sort of therapy.

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:30.590
And he only does it
because he wants his meds.

00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:36.280
And he told me once that he sad to
the person that he works with that,

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:39.350
you know, "I've been writing
these poems for 25 years."

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:44.120
So, you know, he's been and he's
been retelling the stories over

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:46.950 position:56%
and over and over and over and over.

00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:50.360
And even in our rooms the writing
rooms is kind of what happens.

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:54.040
The first year people are
telling those stories.

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:57.450
So I think we are doing that
kind of work even in our rooms

00:33:57.450 --> 00:34:00.380 position:56%
without necessarily maybe knowing it

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:01.970
and not being super
intentional about it.

00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:05.880
But what I've noticed as
people will go the war stories.

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:08.390
When we start the rooms up we tell
them, you know, you don't have

00:34:08.390 --> 00:34:09.690
to write about the war,

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:10.990
you can write about whatever
you want to write about.

00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:12.700
But it always is about the war.

00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:14.760
I mean, I've run these
workshops all over the country

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:16.840
and it's always about the war.

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:22.180
So it goes-- I think we're doing
similar things, similar work.

00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:23.480
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: OK.

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:26.680
OK. And now this is an
open-ended question.

00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:30.370
What can we suggest to congress
to render more attention

00:34:30.370 --> 00:34:34.260
to issues involving PTSD
in the military both

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:37.520
from combat related trauma
and trauma experienced

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:39.890
through sexual assault
and other abuse?

00:34:39.890 --> 00:34:41.980
Dr. Ritchie may I start with you?

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:43.280
&gt;&gt; Elspeth Cameron Ritchie:
You may but again I'm going

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:44.890
to be a little bit
of a heretic on this

00:34:44.890 --> 00:34:48.460 position:56%
because I think actually congress
has paid quite of a bit of attention

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:53.050
to posttraumatic stress disorder,
traumatic brain injury and suicide.

00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:58.730 position:56%
Now, whether that's quite enough and
whether it'll sustain I don't know.

00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:01.460
An area that they don't think
they've paid enough attention

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:06.120 position:56%
which we've been looking at is
issues around sexual health and PTSD

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:09.720
and TBI either in people who've
gotten blown up and lost their legs

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:12.800
or their-- excuse my language,
that they're junk and are wanting

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:17.190
to have a family or many of the
medications that are used for PTSD

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:19.660
and TBI impairs sexual health.

00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:24.320
So I think there's a lot to lip
service paid to PTSD but we need

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:29.340 position:56%
to take it a step beyond what
conventionally when you think about,

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:33.340
about two-thirds of the suicides in
active duty individuals are failure

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:35.150
of romantic relationships.

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:38.410
What we don't know is how much
of that is related to impotence,

00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:42.050
problems with not getting an
erection, maintaining an erection

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:45.960
and how those problems
can poison a relationship

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.780
if they're not talked about.

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:51.190
So I've got a book coming out
this fall "Intimacy Post-Injury",

00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:56.920
how can you help people talk about
these even darker secrets of PTSD

00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:00.090
and then by talking about
it know how you can treat it

00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:03.650
and maintain the intimacy that's
so important to all of us.

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:04.950
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: OK.

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:06.990
Dr. Galovski do you have
any thoughts on that?

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:09.180
&gt;&gt; Tara Galovski: One thing that's
occurred to me and I don't know

00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:11.940
that this would necessarily
take a congressional act

00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:16.290
but being a new comer to the VA
and sitting through many hours

00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:19.320
of orientation and trainings
and those types of things,

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.290
most of actually which
were very interesting,

00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:22.590
everyone thought it
was going to be bad

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:25.560
but it was actually
very interesting.

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:31.300 position:56%
There is a [inaudible] in a culture
in the VA that the soldier is a man.

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:37.360
Every example is that there's-- and
I found myself cut and then women.

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:38.720
And how about the women, you know?

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:43.900 position:56%
And so I think that given that women
are the fastest growing segment

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:49.890
of the veteran and certainly on
active duty as well population.

00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:55.650
I think that a concerted effort
to recognize that soldiers are men

00:36:55.650 --> 00:37:02.310
and women and would make it much
more of a safe place for women

00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:04.910
to come and take these
kinds of issues,

00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:08.040
sexual health absolutely
is one of them.

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:10.780
OBGYN needs to be expanded
but certainly also PTSD

00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:15.740
and really the full range of
the women's health spectrum.

00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:17.040
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: OK.

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.340
Dr. Wrenn?

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:19.640
&gt;&gt; Glenda Wrenn: For me one thing

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:21.360
that I think hasn't gotten
enough attention in terms

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:23.350
of requirements is that issue

00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:27.530
of military cultural competence
training particularly among

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:30.630
healthcare providers that
serve veteran populations

00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:35.320 position:56%
of which now is pretty much everyone
but the choice program and also

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:38.790
for the fact that most veterans
get their care outside of the VA.

00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:42.300
Working part-time at the VA myself
I have always been kind of confuse

00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:45.220
as to why I have hundreds
of required trainings

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:48.110
on blood borne pathogens
and all kinds of things

00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:51.770
but it was never part of the
requirement of on boarding

00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:54.160
to have just basic knowledge.

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:57.280 position:56%
And as a psychiatrist I have talked
with colleagues who worked at the VA

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:59.450
who don't think it's important.

00:37:59.450 --> 00:38:01.280
They don't think that's necessary.

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:04.050
And I think that that's
kind of like a darker side

00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:08.910
to the healthcare field but now
there are VA sources, Psych Armor

00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:12.020
and the Center for Deployment
Psychology have provided amazing

00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:15.160 position:56%
free trainings that can be utilized.

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:17.620
And, I mean, the voluntary
thing is nice but I also think

00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:20.950
that it's a requirement I think
to be able to have the skills

00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:23.430
that you need to serve
the population

00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:25.110
from a healthcare perspective.

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:27.110
&gt;&gt; Elspeth Cameron Ritchie: And
they are moving towards putting

00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:29.510
that into medical schools,
the curricular

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:30.920
and other nursing schools.

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:34.780
So there's a lot of grassroots
effort to do that but that's got

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:37.080 position:56%
to be systematic across the country.

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:38.380
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: OK.

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:39.680
Great. Thank you.

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:40.980
OK. All right.

00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:44.510
The next question is how can
civilian citizens who want

00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:47.790
to help veterans best
engage in solutions

00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:49.430
to migrate the impact of PTSD?

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:53.180
Dr. Glanda Wrenn, you want
to talk a little bit on that?

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:54.480
&gt;&gt; Glenda Wrenn: Yeah.

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:55.980
I mean I think civilian
citizens can also go online

00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:59.930
and take those classes and, you
know, to also reach out to those

00:38:59.930 --> 00:39:02.780
in your community whether
it's a faith community

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:04.460
or another community
based organization

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:08.310
that wherever you're engaged in
a civic way I think that's part

00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:12.620 position:56%
of citizenship is kind of building
community and supporting each other.

00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:15.920
And the hard thing is that
it's not just competence

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:18.910
but it's also cultural
humility that's required

00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:20.800 position:56%
because you don't know what it means

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.540
that a person says
they're a veteran.

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:26.240
You know, that is useful as a
starting point but it's just

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:27.540
as useful as looking at me

00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:29.000
and saying I'm an African
American woman.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.050
You have no idea what that
really means who I really am.

00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:36.330
So being able to have the
courage to if you find out

00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:41.100
or the person discloses that
they are a veteran to have kind

00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:44.650 position:56%
of that cultural humility framework
to say, you know, to what extent has

00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:45.950
that really shaped your identity.

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:48.080
Or, you know, I hear
about these other things,

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:49.840
is this something that
you struggle with.

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:51.660
And I think that's something

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:54.710
that civilian citizens may
feel kind of unequipped to do.

00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:56.010
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: OK.

00:39:56.010 --> 00:39:57.970
&gt;&gt; Glenda Wrenn: But you can
get the training that you need

00:39:57.970 --> 00:40:01.160
and it's really needed because
it's isolative to feel that you're

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:03.760
in a world that you're
no longer a part of.

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:05.060
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: OK.

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:07.930
Maurice, what are your
thoughts on that?

00:40:07.930 --> 00:40:10.340
&gt;&gt; Maurice DeCaul: Well I think
conversation is really important.

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:12.030
You know, at the end of the
day, the people who serve

00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:15.580
in military are your brothers,
sisters, sons, daughters.

00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:18.600
So, I think just being willing
to have the conversations and,

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:20.880
you know, talk to the
difficult things.

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:22.870
I think that can be really helpful.

00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:27.430
As we all know, we know the
numbers 1% of the population serves

00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:29.100
or has served in this war.

00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:31.590
But I think the number
is actually 13%

00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:34.220
of the American population
are veterans, right,

00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:37.060
of the different wars and
the different generations.

00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:39.680
I don't know the exact percentage
of the American population

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:43.630
that is related to those
veterans but I'm pretty sure most

00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:45.000
of us have some sort
of relationship.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.310
Even in my own family, I have
four different touch points,

00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:52.760
not even my own in terms of
people who served in the military.

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:56.350
So, I think just having those
conversations being willing

00:40:56.350 --> 00:41:00.170
to listen, being willing
to not judge,

00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:01.530
I think, can be really important.

00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:06.010
The public humanities, I
think, can bridge that.

00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:08.720
There are programs that are
happening across the country

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:12.400 position:56%
that intend to bring military and
civilians together in the same room.

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:14.960
Often times, in my
role, they are the base.

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:17.620
So, you know, a show
will be performed.

00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:20.480
And at the end of the show, there
will be a talk back and we'll talk

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:25.730
about AJAX, and what does AJAX mean
to the vets in the room but also

00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:28.210
to the civilians in the room
in relation to each other.

00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:32.250 position:56%
So, there is ways to do these things
and people are already doing them.

00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:36.870
I do believe, just having
a willingness to listen

00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:40.010
and to engage a conversation
sort of the first step.

00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:41.830
&gt;&gt; Elspeth Cameron Ritchie:
Let me add one point quickly,

00:41:41.830 --> 00:41:45.360
which is before you do
anything, see what the needs are.

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:48.820
There's often a lot of people
want to provide free something,

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:50.690
send them to the veterans
at Walter Reed

00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:52.540
who are just inundated
with donations.

00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:58.700
And one need that is consistent and
under appreciated, a female veteran

00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:02.290
who are young, who have
children, who have-- are homeless.

00:42:02.290 --> 00:42:06.960
They often don't fit into
the kind of veteran SRO,

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:09.490 position:56%
single residency occupant, you know.

00:42:09.490 --> 00:42:12.430
And there aren't enough
places for them.

00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:13.890
Unfortunately, in the military,

00:42:13.890 --> 00:42:16.590
there's about twice the
unintended pregnancy rate

00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:18.550
as in the civilian world.

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:22.660
Many of those women can't juggle
both couple of small children

00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:25.850
and the military and they
may be single or divorced

00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:28.420
or perhaps married but
too many of them are

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:30.880
out on the streets
with a small children.

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:35.240
So that's a really important
need that isn't being addressed.

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:42.160
&gt;&gt; Tara Galovski: And I think Dr.
Ritchie said this earlier the idea

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:46.540
that give the veteran some space.

00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:50.790
The re-integration is a
very different process

00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:53.220
across veterans in my experience.

00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:57.060
And as a college professor,
a lot of--

00:42:57.060 --> 00:42:58.970
we had a lot of student veterans.

00:42:58.970 --> 00:43:02.720
And so, we got to see some
of those processes, you know,

00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:05.080
juggling small kids,
being a little bit older

00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:09.610
than the traditional student for
example, having to juggle career

00:43:09.610 --> 00:43:12.240
and certainly education
and so forth.

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:16.920
And watching those worlds collide
with individuals who hadn't served

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:19.770
and trying to understand
that military culture.

00:43:19.770 --> 00:43:23.670
So, trying to find the common place
to meet people where they're at

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:26.160
and understand what it
is that veteran needs

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:28.980
that might be very different
from the next veteran's needs.

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:30.280
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: OK.

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:32.310
OK. We're going to have one
more group discussion question

00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:35.500
and then we're going to open
the floor for the audience.

00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:38.780
Are there alternative or
complementary therapies

00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:41.540 position:56%
that you believe are under-utilized?

00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:43.260
&gt;&gt; Elspeth Cameron Ritchie:
There absolutely are.

00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:46.980 position:56%
The challenges with what's called
integrated medicine or complementary

00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:48.280
and alternative medicine is

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:51.260
that we don't have good
science behind much--

00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:52.750
though the science is emerging.

00:43:52.750 --> 00:43:55.830
So, for example, acupuncture
and yoga, meditation,

00:43:55.830 --> 00:43:57.720
we now have the sciences to show

00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:00.730
that in some people,
they're really helpful.

00:44:00.730 --> 00:44:07.370
One of my favorite pet therapies
is working with dogs or horses.

00:44:07.370 --> 00:44:10.910
Cats don't do it, neither
do goldfish.

00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:15.860
But there's a lot of, in a sense,
bio-feedback that you can do.

00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:19.430
There's controversy about
service dogs and other technique

00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:23.190
which is relatively new, it's
called Stellate Ganglion Block,

00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:25.990
its lidocaine and the
stellate ganglion.

00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:29.730
I was quoted in Playboy
recently and an article about it

00:44:29.730 --> 00:44:32.900
and they called it the God
shot because with some people,

00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:34.200
it was really helpful

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:37.420
to dramatically reduce
their PTSD symptoms.

00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:40.680
Special Forces won't go near
a psychiatrist, but they'll go

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:42.990
to somebody who will
give them a shot to help

00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:45.040
with their knee pain, for example.

00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:47.740
So, yes, there's a lot
of good stuff out there

00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:51.090
and that's another area we
do need congressional support

00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:52.390
to get the funding.

00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:55.070
Unfortunately, pharmaceutical
companies don't fund,

00:44:55.070 --> 00:44:56.550
studies of dog therapy.

00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:57.850
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: OK.

00:44:57.850 --> 00:44:59.150
&gt;&gt; Elspeth Cameron Ritchie:
And so, we got to go there.

00:44:59.150 --> 00:45:00.450
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: Yeah.

00:45:00.450 --> 00:45:01.750
&gt;&gt; Tara Galovski: Yes.

00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:05.440
I think there's absolutely a
place for these alternative

00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:07.580
and non-traditional routes.

00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:10.540
I just actually published
a trial looking at hypnosis

00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:14.840
for PTSD sleep-related
impairment which is a huge problem

00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:17.430
and we found we are--
my hypothesis was

00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:20.200
if we can get people sleeping
better, right, we all feel better

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:21.700
when we get a goodnight sleep.

00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:23.000
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: Yes.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.300
&gt;&gt; Tara Galovski: Then people
can engage with the process

00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:26.110
of recovery a little bit more.

00:45:26.110 --> 00:45:29.880
And that was actually
funded by the complementary

00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:32.140
and alternative institute at NIH.

00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:38.770
And we found that we were able to
directly target sleep impairment

00:45:38.770 --> 00:45:42.160
that was very specific to
PTSD and people were able

00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:43.670
to get some restore to sleep.

00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:50.790
And that it didn't actually
influence their ability to recover

00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:53.560
from PTSD, right, CPG was
quite even in that respect

00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:56.550
but it did influence people's
recovery and depression.

00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:58.240
And so, it kind of have that--

00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:00.680
it lifted that added burden
off of people's plates,

00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:04.120
so I think that there's
all kinds of avenues

00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:08.120
and the more choices we have,
the better able we are served.

00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:09.420
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: OK.

00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:10.720
Thank you, and Dr. Wrenn?

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:12.020
&gt;&gt; Glenda Wrenn: I really agree
with everything that's been said.

00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:14.530
We're also doing research
on sleep as a diagnostic

00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:17.050
and predictive tool for PTSD.

00:46:17.050 --> 00:46:20.850
There's work happening in
the Atlanta VA around yoga.

00:46:20.850 --> 00:46:23.180
Because, again, it's building
the evidence but then you want

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:25.060
to be able to fund the
things that have evidence

00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:28.580
and not just continuing to
support things that have been

00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:30.920
around for a long time but
don't work for everyone.

00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:35.810
So, I think it's good to continue
to explore other options especially

00:46:35.810 --> 00:46:37.880
when you see that there
are still a lot of gaps

00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:40.510
and people not accessing
care that needed.

00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:43.060
It's not always the person
that's doing something wrong,

00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:46.840
sometime it's the treatment
that's not been properly tailored.

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:48.380
Strength base interventions

00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:51.690
and resilience based intervention
is also might be effective

00:46:51.690 --> 00:46:56.450 position:56%
in their ability to kind of overcome
some of the barriers by connecting

00:46:56.450 --> 00:46:58.790
where people already
feel comfortable,

00:46:58.790 --> 00:47:01.810
then you can introduce some
of those effective elements

00:47:01.810 --> 00:47:03.990
of exposure based interventions.

00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:06.400
So, I think there is still
a lot of work that we can do

00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:10.540
to develop effective treatments and
that includes a range of options.

00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:11.840
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: OK.

00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:13.140
&gt;&gt; Elspeth Cameron Ritchie: Yeah.

00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:14.440
I work down in Southern
Maryland now one day a week

00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:16.070
and Southern Maryland is
kind of rural Charlotte Hall.

00:47:16.070 --> 00:47:18.600
So, I ask people what
they like to do

00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:22.470
and a fair amount would
like to fish or to boat.

00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:27.680
And they find that that's
become their own self-guided,

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:28.980
so over a command.

00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:32.300
OK. You know, let's make sure
you do some more fishing.

00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:34.780
And at times with the PTSD,
they will be scared to go

00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:37.910
out of their house, so you have
to help them bridge through that.

00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:42.330
But build on what people
already know and enjoy.

00:47:42.330 --> 00:47:45.360
And we haven't mentioned writing
as a therapeutic modality,

00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:48.500
but certainly, writing
and art therapy.

00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:51.410
Many people don't like to
talk about what happened,

00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:53.680
but they can paint a mask.

00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:55.780
And so, there's a, you know, again,

00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:58.530
the theme here range
of different options.

00:47:58.530 --> 00:47:59.830
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: OK.

00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:01.130
Great. Thank you.

00:48:01.130 --> 00:48:02.430
Maurice?

00:48:02.430 --> 00:48:03.730
&gt;&gt; Maurice DeCaul: Yeah.

00:48:03.730 --> 00:48:05.870
And I'll say again, with writings,
as you mentioned Dr. Ritchie

00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:11.210
in my experience, in my
personal experience as well.

00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:13.030
You know, it can be very helpful.

00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:17.520
I never talked about the
war, six years back from Iraq

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:20.590
and never talked about
it until I got to NYU

00:48:20.590 --> 00:48:22.330
and started that writing workshop.

00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:24.000
And they taught me
how to write poetry.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.460
And then I started
writing all these poems.

00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:30.110
So, yeah, writing, art.

00:48:30.110 --> 00:48:32.130
I have lots of friends
who are artist.

00:48:32.130 --> 00:48:33.980
They're sculptures,
they are painters.

00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:36.960
The outdoors is also
I think very helpful.

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:39.450
There are programs
that already exist.

00:48:39.450 --> 00:48:43.860
Outward bound does these adventure
programs throughout the country.

00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:47.200
You can go kayaking or sailing
or mountain climbing or skiing

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:49.550
or whatever it is that you
want to do and whatever kind

00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:52.390
of challenge you want to
challenge yourself physically,

00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:53.690
they can provide it for you.

00:48:53.690 --> 00:48:57.750
So, there are many different
ways that I've seen with folks

00:48:57.750 --> 00:49:00.620
that I know and even with myself.

00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:01.920
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: OK.

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:03.220
Great, great.

00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:05.410
Thank you panel you've just
done a wonderful job today.

00:49:05.410 --> 00:49:06.710
Thank you so much.

00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:08.400
And so, at this time, we would
like to open up the floor

00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:12.910
for any questions that the audience
may have for any of the panelist?

00:49:12.910 --> 00:49:14.210
&gt;&gt; Elspeth Cameron Ritchie:

00:49:14.210 --> 00:49:16.300
And it looks like they're
grabbing a mic for the audience.

00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:18.480
And if we could just add,
I always like to know

00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:19.780
who is asking the question.

00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:22.660
So, if you could just
introduce yourself briefly.

00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:26.510
&gt;&gt; Does this work?

00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:29.470
Hello? My name is Dr. Chris Nelson.

00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:31.580
I'm-- actually, I used to
be a civilian psychiatrist

00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:34.610
and for the past five years I've
been working at Camp Lejeune

00:49:34.610 --> 00:49:38.330
with the PTSD clinic which I think
is extremely gratifying work.

00:49:38.330 --> 00:49:41.170 position:56%
And I just wanted to say
parenthetically that I totally agree

00:49:41.170 --> 00:49:45.090
with Dr. Wrenn that the military
cultural competence piece is very

00:49:45.090 --> 00:49:47.960
much missing in that kind of
work that I've been doing.

00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:50.150
And I have to say, I've kind
of learn from my mistakes

00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:52.420 position:56%
as a civilian contract psychiatrist.

00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:55.990
But I think, you know, it's
extremely exciting work.

00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:58.830 position:56%
And if anybody knows other shrinks
that are sick of what they're doing,

00:49:58.830 --> 00:50:01.580
want to do something else I would
suggest that they try to work

00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:03.010
with the PTSD population,

00:50:03.010 --> 00:50:05.250
because these patients
desperately need the help

00:50:05.250 --> 00:50:07.080
and they do get better.

00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:09.350
But, I had a question for
Dr. Galovski about something

00:50:09.350 --> 00:50:12.640
that I've heard about and that
is something called accelerated

00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:16.160
resolution therapy which is
apparently a kind of a condense

00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:19.530
or sort of a, you know,
compressed version

00:50:19.530 --> 00:50:22.140
of the standard prolonged
exposure protocol.

00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:24.580
And I wonder if you
have any understanding

00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:27.030
of whether that's proven
successful so far?

00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:28.610
And if so, could we kind

00:50:28.610 --> 00:50:31.840 position:56%
of beat this problem Dr. Ritchie was
mentioning of people not being able

00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:35.980
to stay with like with 20 different
sessions of prolonged exposure?

00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:37.280
&gt;&gt; Tara Galovski: Yeah.

00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:38.580
That's a good example of that.

00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:43.370
I don't-- that remains to be
seen with that specific therapy

00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:47.880
but prolonged exposure, they've
published to mass interventions now

00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:51.730
where they've done the
entire protocol in two weeks.

00:50:51.730 --> 00:50:54.520
And we actually just this
week submitted a proposal

00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:58.400
to do cognitive processing
therapy in one week.

00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:01.720
And when I look at my-- I've
read a number of RCTs myself

00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:04.260
and when I look at my drop-out
rates, people aren't dropping

00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:06.810
out because they can't
tolerate the therapy.

00:51:06.810 --> 00:51:09.450
They're dropping out because
life is getting in the way.

00:51:09.450 --> 00:51:11.240
My patients have gone
back to prison.

00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:14.110
My patients have-- had
their homes foreclosed

00:51:14.110 --> 00:51:16.290
and need to move some place else.

00:51:16.290 --> 00:51:21.760
My patients have gotten a
life-threatening medical diagnosis

00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:24.380
and, you know, and so forth.

00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:31.110
And so, I think that that is the
solution to getting people engaged

00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:33.300
and getting people over that hump.

00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:40.440
You know, it's-- we have found
that when someone comes in,

00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:44.390 position:56%
they're kind of at that rock bottom
place often times and striking while

00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:46.770
that iron is hot is critical.

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:49.100
We've had-- I've run a couple of
trials where we've done something

00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:52.660
like motivational interviewing
and then CPT or like I was talking

00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:55.950
about my sleep project, then CPT.

00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:58.570
And that that window there
are drop-out rates go

00:51:58.570 --> 00:52:01.880
through the roof even though
that's precisely what we're trying

00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:04.030
to decrease as drop-out rates.

00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:08.600
And I think it's because folks come
in and they're ready to go and we,

00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:13.280
as the clinician, for good reasons,
sometimes, put on the breaks.

00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:16.430
And so, what happens
is that someone,

00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:18.660
you know, they shy away from it.

00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:22.490
So, if someone could
commit to one week, come in,

00:52:22.490 --> 00:52:25.680
move through the protocol, think
through the memory differently,

00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:30.040
come to different conclusions,
learn that they can safely engage

00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:33.030
with that memory so the
process of habituation.

00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:35.680
Imagine that you could do that
in one week and then walk away.

00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:39.200
And so, P has done and CPT
has not yet very successfully

00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:41.840
with huge effect sizes and
very low drop-out rates.

00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:43.140
&gt;&gt; Elspeth Cameron Ritchie:

00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:50.530
We've got a question
back here too, I think.

00:52:50.530 --> 00:52:56.440
&gt;&gt; Yes. Hi, I'm a student
here for actually for my son

00:52:56.440 --> 00:53:00.290
and actually always been
interesting for me is that,

00:53:00.290 --> 00:53:02.940
my ex service in Vietnam twice.

00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:08.820
We went through PTSD while I
was going through PTSD for being

00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:11.540
of four-time cancer survivor.

00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:15.960
And so, at the time, my son
and daughter were very young.

00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:19.930
But then later on, my son
went to Bosnia, Somalia

00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:24.720
and then now I wrap five times in
dessert storm and dessert shield.

00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:27.080
And so, now, I'm seeing
all the stuff

00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:30.190
that he is going through with PTSD.

00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:32.460
One of the things I'm just
trying to figure out is

00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:37.390
that with the VA hospital, they not
putting more money into programs

00:53:37.390 --> 00:53:40.260
to bring in more people
because it seems

00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:44.750
to be waiting list all the time
for him getting to workshops.

00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:48.590
So, if anything has needs to
be done, the congress needs

00:53:48.590 --> 00:53:52.760
to put more money in that area
so they can help them out there

00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:57.850
because it's really in
and out thing for my son.

00:53:57.850 --> 00:54:01.480
And I remember when he came
just back from Somalia,

00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:05.940
he couldn't touch baby for a
long time because her body sore.

00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:11.310 position:56%
And being in Iraq and been in the
dessert storm and dessert shielding,

00:54:11.310 --> 00:54:14.250
it's been really quite right.

00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:16.480
&gt;&gt; Elspeth Cameron Ritchie:
So, there's lot there.

00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:19.460
And first, thank him for
his service and thank you

00:54:19.460 --> 00:54:21.620
and your husband for their service.

00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:23.160
Let me take a little piece of that.

00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:28.710 position:56%
I'm also seeing a lot of Vietnam era
veterans who have been doing fine

00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:32.750
for 30, 40 years now
they're in their 70s

00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:35.630
and their symptoms are
emerging, especially,

00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:38.110
as they're often now
retired, perhaps ill,

00:54:38.110 --> 00:54:40.250
perhaps if loss to spouse.

00:54:40.250 --> 00:54:42.840
And so, the point I was
going to make on this is

00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:46.160
that it's not something that
you have and then it's over.

00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:48.610
It can be triggered easily,
it can come back again.

00:54:48.610 --> 00:54:53.830
In terms of your son, that's
probably a longer conversation,

00:54:53.830 --> 00:54:56.050
especially, is he still
active duty because act

00:54:56.050 --> 00:54:59.490
of duty troops don't want to
go see a shrink very often?

00:54:59.490 --> 00:55:00.960
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: Right.

00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:02.260
&gt;&gt; Elspeth Cameron Ritchie: So,

00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:05.450
there are all the treatments we've
talked about are now available,

00:55:05.450 --> 00:55:07.800
but there's often a lot
of reluctance to engage.

00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:10.780
And so, as you were saying, you
got to strike while the iron is hot

00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:13.080
when they're ready to engage.

00:55:14.310 --> 00:55:16.230
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: OK.

00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:18.540
&gt;&gt; Hi. My name is Sarah Mcneilus.

00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:22.240
I am an MST and PTSD
survivor, sorry.

00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:23.590
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: It's OK.

00:55:23.590 --> 00:55:25.080
&gt;&gt; Sarah Mcneilus: It's a
lot of the anxiety something

00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:26.990
that you deal with all the time.

00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:31.220
I am also married to an
active duty service member

00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:33.540
who just returned from Afghanistan.

00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:39.070
And one of the things that we
struggled with there was a lack

00:55:39.070 --> 00:55:41.880
of access to mental healthcare
for him, specifically,

00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:44.630
with some of the things that
he was seeing over there.

00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:48.830
And one of the things that we did
as a family, I found a therapist

00:55:48.830 --> 00:55:52.410
in New York who would
Skype with him.

00:55:52.410 --> 00:55:57.130
He originally didn't want to
do therapy at all with the--

00:55:57.130 --> 00:56:00.940
There was a British
therapist that he could see

00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:03.260
that was where he was stationed.

00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:07.220
But he also had privacy
concerns about who had access

00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:10.300
to those mental health records
as an active duty service member.

00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:14.750
So I guess my question to the
panel is what are your feelings

00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:19.020
on that lack of privacy
and that lack of access

00:56:19.020 --> 00:56:21.530
that the active duty
service members might have

00:56:21.530 --> 00:56:26.120
because these PTSD doesn't happen
when they become a veteran,

00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:29.530
it happens as a result
of their active service.

00:56:29.530 --> 00:56:30.830
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: OK.

00:56:30.830 --> 00:56:32.130
&gt;&gt; And we're not really
doing anything

00:56:32.130 --> 00:56:33.660
to combat that at that level.

00:56:33.660 --> 00:56:37.490
We're focusing on trying to
treat them after they have left.

00:56:37.490 --> 00:56:39.270
&gt;&gt; Elspeth Cameron Ritchie: So
the military actually has set

00:56:39.270 --> 00:56:44.090
up a fair amount of alternative
programs exactly for those reasons.

00:56:44.090 --> 00:56:48.970
Military OneSource, there is
something called, Given an Hour,

00:56:48.970 --> 00:56:53.490 position:56%
there is other places, chaplains
where there is more confidentiality.

00:56:53.490 --> 00:56:56.970
But, there's always a balance
between the question of fitness

00:56:56.970 --> 00:57:01.580
for duty and somebody
having total privacy.

00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:04.890
So, some of those sources and we
can talk afterwards if you want

00:57:04.890 --> 00:57:07.790
to know how to get involved in
some of the alternative treatments

00:57:07.790 --> 00:57:10.850
that he can do when
he's on active duty.

00:57:10.850 --> 00:57:14.350
&gt;&gt; Glenda Wrenn: I also just
wanted to mention in terms

00:57:14.350 --> 00:57:18.400
of alternate treatments, virtual
reality treatments for PTSD there.

00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:21.640
Barbara Rothbaum who is also
in Atlanta has spearheaded.

00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:24.580
And that's also maybe
more helpful for people

00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:28.770
that have combat specific PTSD for
which that type of an approach.

00:57:28.770 --> 00:57:31.180
It also is a little
different than the circle

00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:32.780
of a group and, you know, exposure.

00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:36.770 position:56%
I think the therapies really do
vary and that that's another example

00:57:36.770 --> 00:57:40.290
of one that has incredible
evidence and it's very effective.

00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:41.590
&gt;&gt; Elspeth Cameron Ritchie:
And for those who didn't know,

00:57:41.590 --> 00:57:45.250
virtual reality, it's usually
with the computer or TV screen.

00:57:45.250 --> 00:57:48.020
And there's a virtual
Iraq or Afghanistan

00:57:48.020 --> 00:57:52.200 position:56%
so that you can be exposed to say,
the sound of gun shot or explosions,

00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:56.370
but you can turn it up or turn
it down as you can tolerate it.

00:57:56.370 --> 00:57:58.510
&gt;&gt; Tara Galovski: It also
sounds like Skype was something

00:57:58.510 --> 00:58:01.970
that was helpful to him and
a lot of these interventions.

00:58:01.970 --> 00:58:05.390
All of the evidence based ones
really had been tested using

00:58:05.390 --> 00:58:06.870
telemental health.

00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:11.150
And so, there might be-- if that
might be an option down the road

00:58:11.150 --> 00:58:14.910
if that was something
that was palatable to him.

00:58:14.910 --> 00:58:17.180
&gt;&gt; OK.

00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:18.480
&gt;&gt; Hi. My name is Elizabeth.

00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:20.270
I worked with the Defense and
Veterans Brain Injury Center.

00:58:20.270 --> 00:58:23.970
So, my question involves a
dual diagnosis of TBI and PTSD.

00:58:23.970 --> 00:58:25.270
&gt;&gt; Elspeth Cameron Ritchie:
And substance abuse.

00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:26.570
Don't forget substance abuse.

00:58:26.570 --> 00:58:27.870
&gt;&gt; Sure, yes.

00:58:27.870 --> 00:58:29.170
And I'm just curious if
the presence of a mild

00:58:29.170 --> 00:58:32.730 position:56%
or moderate TBI changes the way
that you approach the PTSD treatment

00:58:32.730 --> 00:58:35.540
and if it changes the amount
of success that you're seeing,

00:58:35.540 --> 00:58:38.770 position:56%
if they could be treated at the same
time, so just a gambit of questions

00:58:38.770 --> 00:58:40.780
around that duel diagnosis.

00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:44.130
&gt;&gt; Elspeth Cameron Ritchie: So,
most of the patients I see are dual

00:58:44.130 --> 00:58:46.710
or triple or quadruple
by a diagnosis.

00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:50.840 position:56%
I mentioned substance of use there's
a lot of pain disability in there.

00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:55.650
The modality that I used
is no longer, "Pure PTSD".

00:58:55.650 --> 00:58:57.720
I don't know if there
was ever a pure PTSD,

00:58:57.720 --> 00:59:01.440
but we certainly will assess all
of the different parts of this.

00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:04.600
I'm actually really gotten much
more into physical therapy recently

00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:06.980
because a lot of my patients
are putting on weight

00:59:06.980 --> 00:59:08.680
and because of their knee pain.

00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:11.400
And then that contributes to
their lack of self-esteem,

00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:13.480
which contributes to
their sexual problems.

00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:16.010
So, exercises in there.

00:59:16.010 --> 00:59:17.310
And certainly, if you're going

00:59:17.310 --> 00:59:20.110
to be doing something cognitive,
you need to see for TBI.

00:59:20.110 --> 00:59:22.710
It's all in there absolutely.

00:59:22.710 --> 00:59:25.980
&gt;&gt; Tara Galovski: We published
a paper recently that suggested

00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:29.710
that the cognitive processing
therapy with there's a side

00:59:29.710 --> 00:59:35.310
of the Cincinnati VA and that folks
with mild and moderate TBI did just

00:59:35.310 --> 00:59:37.670
as well as folks without.

00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:38.970
And this is program.

00:59:38.970 --> 00:59:40.350
And this isn't just one course.

00:59:40.350 --> 00:59:41.980
This isn't just those 12 sessions.

00:59:41.980 --> 00:59:45.290
These are in a unit that has
a lot of supports around it.

00:59:45.290 --> 00:59:51.220
I think that the data
suggests both academically,

00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:55.510
but also in my clinical experience
that the supports are critical.

00:59:55.510 --> 00:59:59.920
So the lapses in concentration and
those pieces, you need other tools

00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:02.510
to help move through
these interventions.

01:00:02.510 --> 01:00:07.520 position:56%
But, it is really-- there's emerging
data right now that's coming out of

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:11.660
on the brain banks in Boston,
in our tracks programs there

01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:17.530
that are looking at this
really quite remarkably.

01:00:17.530 --> 01:00:22.520
And it really is PTSD,
depression and TBI when the three

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:26.200
of those are onboard which I
think the estimates were about 30%

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:29.490
of our folks with PTSD,
that is really--

01:00:29.490 --> 01:00:33.600
we were seeing the cases that
aren't resolving that PTSD.

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:35.430
That's kind of like
that triple threat.

01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:37.840
It's tough.

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:39.140
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: OK.

01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:40.440 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Elspeth Cameron Ritchie: Maybe I
know we're going to end in a moment.

01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:44.770
One way to think about this is you
hear about the signature wounds

01:00:44.770 --> 01:00:48.180
of the war being PTSD and TBI
but my former [Inaudible],

01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:50.090
a sergeant general in the army,

01:00:50.090 --> 01:00:52.860 position:56%
General Scott Mac [assumed spelling]
are used to talk about the blast

01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:58.110
as a signature weapon of the war,
which causes not only PTSD and TBI,

01:00:58.110 --> 01:01:00.790
but also hearing lost because
your ear drums get blown up,

01:01:00.790 --> 01:01:04.170
maybe facial disfigurement,
burns, of course loss

01:01:04.170 --> 01:01:05.840
of legs, loss of genitals.

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:10.330
So, it's a little bit
different than other wars.

01:01:10.330 --> 01:01:14.030
People who survive this war, they
would have died in other wars.

01:01:14.030 --> 01:01:17.270
You got to Walter Reed and
you see the triple amputees.

01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:21.090
So, these can be really,
really complex cases.

01:01:21.090 --> 01:01:26.490
And PTSD is about one
part of the whole.

01:01:27.510 --> 01:01:28.810
&gt;&gt; Karen L. Fears: OK.

01:01:28.810 --> 01:01:30.220
Great. OK.

01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:31.520
All right then.

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:33.810
Well, I just want to take
this opportunity to thank all

01:01:33.810 --> 01:01:36.550
of the panelists who
shared with us today.

01:01:36.550 --> 01:01:40.050
And I'm truly humble to be here
and to serve in this capacity

01:01:40.050 --> 01:01:42.390
because this is a therapy from me.

01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:47.400
The more I'm able to speak about
these, about PTSD as a result

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:51.260
of sexual assault, and
sexual intimidation,

01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:54.760
rape or whatever the case
may be, it helps me to heal.

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:59.090 position:56%
And so, I'm just hoping and
praying that that would be an outlet

01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:02.900
for anyone else who is out here
experiencing the same thing.

01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:06.180
So, Dr. Wrenn, I want to thank
you for being here with us today,

01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:12.360
Dr. Galovski, Dr. Ritchie
and Maurice DeCaul.

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:15.670
And thank you guys so
much for joining us today.

01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:18.580
And you can just meet with
the panelist afterwards.

01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:20.180
Thank you so much.

01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:22.350
[ Applause ]

01:02:22.350 --> 01:02:26.000
