00:00:12.921 --> 00:00:15.325
After cutting her arm with a broken glass,

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:20.423
she fell into a fitful, exhausted sleep
on the railway station platform.

00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:24.443
Early in the morning,
when the station toilets were opened,

00:00:24.467 --> 00:00:27.640
she got painfully to her feet,
and made her way over to them.

00:00:28.458 --> 00:00:30.537
When she saw her reflection in the mirror,

00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:31.828
she started to cry.

00:00:32.792 --> 00:00:34.974
Her face was dirty and tearstained;

00:00:34.998 --> 00:00:37.323
her shirt was ripped and covered in blood.

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:42.085
She looked as if she'd been on the streets
for three months, not three days.

00:00:42.998 --> 00:00:45.449
She washed herself as best she could.

00:00:45.473 --> 00:00:48.140
Her arms and stomach were hurting badly.

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:50.728
She tried to clean the wounds,

00:00:50.752 --> 00:00:53.934
but any pressure she applied
just started the bleeding again.

00:00:55.244 --> 00:00:59.080
She needed stitches, but there was no way
she would go to a hospital.

00:00:59.718 --> 00:01:01.567
They'd have sent her back home again.

00:01:01.591 --> 00:01:02.741
Back to him.

00:01:03.964 --> 00:01:05.893
She tightened her jacket --

00:01:05.917 --> 00:01:08.450
well, fastened her jacket tightly
to cover the blood.

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:11.442
She looked back at herself in the mirror.

00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:14.644
She looked a little better than before
but was past caring.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.736
There was only one thing
she could think of doing.

00:01:19.093 --> 00:01:22.433
She came out of the station
and into a phone box nearby.

00:01:23.456 --> 00:01:27.037
(Telephone rings)

00:01:28.863 --> 00:01:31.607
(Telephone rings)

00:01:32.339 --> 00:01:34.300
Woman: Samaritans, can I help you?

00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:39.651
Hello, Samaritans. Can I help you?

00:01:40.076 --> 00:01:41.727
Girl: (Crying) I -- I don't know.

00:01:42.895 --> 00:01:46.053
Woman: What's happened?
You sound very upset.

00:01:46.077 --> 00:01:48.378
(Girl cries)

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:52.720
Woman: Why not start with your name?

00:01:52.744 --> 00:01:54.677
I'm Pam. What can I call you?

00:01:57.894 --> 00:02:00.022
Where are you speaking from?

00:02:00.046 --> 00:02:01.196
Are you safe?

00:02:02.244 --> 00:02:04.264
Girl: It's a phone box in London.

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:08.588
Pam: You sound very young.
How old are you?

00:02:08.612 --> 00:02:09.762
Girl: Fourteen.

00:02:10.374 --> 00:02:12.739
Pam: And what's happened
to make you so upset?

00:02:13.128 --> 00:02:17.022
Girl: I just want to die.
Every day I wake up and wish I was dead.

00:02:17.046 --> 00:02:20.767
If he doesn't kill me, then, I think,
I want to do it myself.

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:23.616
Pam: I'm glad you called.

00:02:24.165 --> 00:02:26.031
Let's start at the beginning.

00:02:28.854 --> 00:02:32.014
Sophie Andrews: Pam continued to gently
ask the girl about herself.

00:02:32.038 --> 00:02:34.582
She didn't say much;
there were lots of silences.

00:02:35.222 --> 00:02:36.576
But she knew she was there,

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.952
and having Pam on the end of the phone
felt so comforting.

00:02:42.365 --> 00:02:44.793
The 14-year-old
that made that call was me.

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:48.122
That was me in the phone box.

00:02:48.451 --> 00:02:52.336
I was running away from home,
sleeping rough on the streets in London.

00:02:53.426 --> 00:02:56.459
I was being sexually abused
by my father and his friends.

00:02:57.681 --> 00:03:00.747
I was self-harming every day.
I was suicidal.

00:03:03.847 --> 00:03:07.502
The first time I called Samaritans,
I was 12 and absolutely desperate.

00:03:08.371 --> 00:03:11.027
It was a few months after
my mother had deserted me,

00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:13.252
walked out and left me in the family home.

00:03:14.077 --> 00:03:17.482
And the abuse I was suffering
at the hands of my father and his friends

00:03:17.506 --> 00:03:19.239
had left me a total wreck.

00:03:20.232 --> 00:03:22.839
I was running away, I was missing school,

00:03:22.863 --> 00:03:24.196
I was arriving drunk.

00:03:24.957 --> 00:03:27.424
I was without hope and wanted to die.

00:03:28.934 --> 00:03:30.851
And that's where Samaritans came in.

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:36.345
Samaritans has been around since 1953.

00:03:36.878 --> 00:03:40.497
It's a 24/7 confidential
helpline in the UK

00:03:40.521 --> 00:03:43.544
for anyone who might be feeling
desperate or suicidal.

00:03:44.036 --> 00:03:45.503
Which I certainly was.

00:03:46.411 --> 00:03:49.592
Volunteers answer the phone
around the clock every day of the year,

00:03:49.616 --> 00:03:51.148
and calls are confidential.

00:03:53.204 --> 00:03:55.744
During my teenage years,
when I was most desperate,

00:03:55.768 --> 00:03:57.901
Samaritans became my lifeline.

00:03:58.776 --> 00:04:01.426
They promised me total confidentiality.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.259
And that allowed me to trust them.

00:04:04.315 --> 00:04:07.506
Disturbing as they no doubt
found my story, they never showed it.

00:04:08.457 --> 00:04:11.529
They were always there for me
and listened without judgment.

00:04:12.244 --> 00:04:14.426
Mostly, they gently
encouraged me to get help;

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.397
I never felt out of control with them --

00:04:17.014 --> 00:04:18.188
an interesting parallel,

00:04:18.212 --> 00:04:21.775
as I felt so out of control
in every other aspect of my life.

00:04:22.632 --> 00:04:24.841
It felt my self-harm
was probably the only area

00:04:24.865 --> 00:04:26.710
where I felt I had any control.

00:04:29.442 --> 00:04:33.175
A few years later, I managed to get
some control in my life.

00:04:33.641 --> 00:04:35.903
And I had appropriate support around me

00:04:35.927 --> 00:04:38.045
to allow me to live
with what had happened.

00:04:38.387 --> 00:04:41.144
I had become a survivor of abuse
rather than a victim.

00:04:42.204 --> 00:04:44.688
And at 21, I contacted Samaritans again.

00:04:45.299 --> 00:04:48.038
This time because I wanted
to become a volunteer.

00:04:48.426 --> 00:04:49.879
Wanted to pay something back

00:04:49.903 --> 00:04:52.789
to the organization
that had really saved my life.

00:04:54.674 --> 00:04:58.324
I knew that the simple act of listening
in an empathetic way

00:04:58.348 --> 00:05:00.046
could have a profound effect.

00:05:00.991 --> 00:05:04.023
I knew that somebody
listening to me without judgment

00:05:04.047 --> 00:05:05.737
would make the biggest difference.

00:05:07.673 --> 00:05:10.648
So I caught up with my education,

00:05:10.672 --> 00:05:14.617
found someone I could persuade
to give me a job,

00:05:14.641 --> 00:05:17.394
and I enjoyed my volunteering
at Samaritans.

00:05:17.744 --> 00:05:20.237
And when I say "enjoyed,"
it's an odd word to use,

00:05:20.261 --> 00:05:22.324
because no one would want
to think of anyone

00:05:22.348 --> 00:05:24.403
being in absolute distress or pain.

00:05:25.053 --> 00:05:27.776
But I knew that that profound impact
of that listening ear

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.037
and someone being alongside me
at that desperate time

00:05:31.061 --> 00:05:32.276
had the biggest impact,

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.895
and I felt a great sense of fulfillment

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:37.182
that I was able to help people
as a Samaritan.

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.347
In my years volunteering at Samaritans,
I was asked to perform many roles.

00:05:42.371 --> 00:05:45.537
But I guess the peak came in 2008,

00:05:45.561 --> 00:05:48.371
when I was asked to chair
the organization for three years.

00:05:48.395 --> 00:05:50.744
So I had actually gone
from that vulnerable caller

00:05:50.768 --> 00:05:52.768
in the phone box, desperate for help,

00:05:52.792 --> 00:05:55.029
to being the national lead
for the organization

00:05:55.053 --> 00:05:57.586
and responsible for 22,000 volunteers.

00:05:59.018 --> 00:06:00.748
I actually used to joke at the time

00:06:00.772 --> 00:06:02.898
and say if you really
screwed up as a caller,

00:06:02.922 --> 00:06:04.589
you might end up running the place.

00:06:04.613 --> 00:06:05.764
(Laughter)

00:06:05.788 --> 00:06:06.958
Which I did.

00:06:06.982 --> 00:06:12.069
But I guess in a world which is dominated
by professionalizing everything we do,

00:06:12.093 --> 00:06:14.585
I really understood
that that simple act of listening

00:06:14.609 --> 00:06:16.744
could have such a life-changing effect.

00:06:17.578 --> 00:06:19.007
I guess it's a simple concept

00:06:19.031 --> 00:06:21.474
that can be applied
across all areas of life.

00:06:22.768 --> 00:06:24.800
So in the 1980s, when I called Samaritans,

00:06:24.824 --> 00:06:27.394
child abuse was a subject
no one wanted to talk about.

00:06:28.022 --> 00:06:31.874
Victims were often blamed,
victims were often judged.

00:06:33.236 --> 00:06:37.051
And it was a topic of shame,
and no one really wanted to talk about it.

00:06:38.284 --> 00:06:41.847
Today, judgment and shame
surround a different issue.

00:06:41.871 --> 00:06:44.275
There's a different stigma
that's out there.

00:06:44.633 --> 00:06:48.044
And the stigma that's there today
is to talk about loneliness.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.522
Loneliness and isolation
have profound health impacts.

00:06:53.546 --> 00:06:57.305
Being lonely can have a significant impact
on your own well-being.

00:06:58.022 --> 00:07:00.180
Recent systematic review of research

00:07:00.204 --> 00:07:02.800
actually said that it increased
the mortality rates,

00:07:02.824 --> 00:07:04.149
or premature death rates,

00:07:04.173 --> 00:07:05.506
by up to 30 percent.

00:07:06.556 --> 00:07:10.573
It can lead to higher blood pressure,
higher levels of depression,

00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:12.779
and actually aligned to mortality rates

00:07:12.803 --> 00:07:17.148
that might be more associated
with alcohol abuse or smoking cigarettes.

00:07:17.913 --> 00:07:21.332
Loneliness is actually more harmful
that smoking 15 cigarettes.

00:07:21.667 --> 00:07:22.857
A day.

00:07:23.215 --> 00:07:24.875
Not in your life, in your day.

00:07:25.324 --> 00:07:28.244
It's also associated
with higher levels of dementia.

00:07:28.268 --> 00:07:30.156
So a recent study also found

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.961
that lonely people are twice at risk
of Alzheimer's disease.

00:07:35.728 --> 00:07:39.896
Of course, there's many people
that live alone who are not lonely.

00:07:40.696 --> 00:07:44.323
But being a caregiver for a partner
that maybe has dementia

00:07:44.347 --> 00:07:46.080
can be a very lonely place.

00:07:47.163 --> 00:07:50.291
And a recent landmark study gave us
a very good, clear definition

00:07:50.315 --> 00:07:51.830
of what loneliness is.

00:07:51.854 --> 00:07:55.256
And it said it's a subjective,
unwelcome feeling

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.614
of a lack or loss of companionship.

00:07:58.185 --> 00:08:00.249
And it happens when there's a mismatch

00:08:00.273 --> 00:08:03.939
between the quality and the quantity
of relationships that we have

00:08:03.963 --> 00:08:05.310
and those that we want.

00:08:07.007 --> 00:08:09.746
Now in my life, the best help
I've ever received

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:11.920
has been from those personal connections

00:08:11.944 --> 00:08:14.475
and being listened to
in an empathetic way.

00:08:15.561 --> 00:08:19.006
Professionals, and I'm conscious
I'm speaking to a room of professionals,

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:20.427
have a very important place.

00:08:20.451 --> 00:08:23.466
But for me, a volunteer
giving up their time

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:27.220
and listening to me without judgment
in a confidential way,

00:08:27.244 --> 00:08:29.998
had such a huge,
life-changing effect for me.

00:08:30.546 --> 00:08:33.013
And that was something
that really stayed with me.

00:08:33.561 --> 00:08:35.935
So as you will have gathered,
in my teenage years,

00:08:35.959 --> 00:08:39.874
I was off the rails, I was going every day
wondering if I'd even live the next day.

00:08:39.898 --> 00:08:43.808
But that profound impact of the volunteer
listening to me stayed with me.

00:08:44.673 --> 00:08:46.799
When I finally got to a point in my life

00:08:46.823 --> 00:08:49.371
where I felt I could live
with what had happened,

00:08:49.395 --> 00:08:51.053
I wanted to pay something back.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.140
And in my experience,

00:08:53.164 --> 00:08:56.054
people who have been helped
in a transforming way

00:08:56.078 --> 00:08:57.927
always want to pay something back.

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:03.645
So I started paying back by my 25 years
volunteering with Samaritans.

00:09:05.125 --> 00:09:07.158
And then, in 2013,

00:09:07.182 --> 00:09:10.831
picking up on that whole issue
and the new stigma of loneliness,

00:09:10.855 --> 00:09:14.466
I launched a new national
helpline in the UK for older people,

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:15.696
called The Silver Line,

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:19.084
which is there to support
lonely and isolated older people.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.793
In our short history,
we've taken 1.5 million calls.

00:09:24.276 --> 00:09:28.097
And I know we're having a big impact,
based on the feedback we get every day.

00:09:29.411 --> 00:09:32.006
Some people might be calling up
for a friendly chat,

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.514
maybe some information
about local services.

00:09:34.538 --> 00:09:37.180
Some might be calling
because they're suicidal.

00:09:37.204 --> 00:09:39.998
Some might be calling up
because they're reporting abuse.

00:09:40.693 --> 00:09:44.537
And some quite simply, as I was,
may have simply just given up on life.

00:09:46.931 --> 00:09:49.685
I guess it's a really simple idea,
setting up a helpline.

00:09:49.709 --> 00:09:51.418
And I look back to those early days

00:09:51.442 --> 00:09:55.157
when I had the lofty title, I still have,
of chief exec, but in the early days,

00:09:55.181 --> 00:09:56.632
I was chief exec of myself.

00:09:56.982 --> 00:10:00.139
Which, I have to say, I had
the best meetings ever in my career --

00:10:00.163 --> 00:10:01.314
(Laughter)

00:10:01.338 --> 00:10:02.624
as chief exec of myself.

00:10:02.648 --> 00:10:06.431
But things have moved on, and now in 2017,

00:10:06.455 --> 00:10:10.183
we have over 200 staff
listening to older people

00:10:10.207 --> 00:10:12.074
every day of the year, 24/7.

00:10:12.673 --> 00:10:16.443
We also have over 3,000 volunteers
making weekly friendship calls

00:10:16.467 --> 00:10:17.806
from their own home.

00:10:18.767 --> 00:10:20.974
We also, for people
that like the written word,

00:10:20.998 --> 00:10:23.895
offer Silver Letters,
and we write pen-pal letters

00:10:23.919 --> 00:10:26.883
to older people who still enjoy
receiving a letter.

00:10:27.497 --> 00:10:30.418
And we also have introduced
something called Silver Circles --

00:10:30.442 --> 00:10:32.706
you notice I'm owning
the word "silver" here --

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:34.733
put "silver" in front of it and it's ours.

00:10:34.757 --> 00:10:36.714
Silver Circles are group conference calls

00:10:36.728 --> 00:10:39.062
where people actually
talk about shared interests.

00:10:39.086 --> 00:10:40.935
My favorite group is the music group,

00:10:40.959 --> 00:10:43.312
where people, every week,
play musical instruments

00:10:43.336 --> 00:10:45.132
down the phone to each other.

00:10:45.156 --> 00:10:47.387
Not always the same tune at the same time.

00:10:47.411 --> 00:10:48.950
(Laughter)

00:10:48.974 --> 00:10:50.374
But they do have fun.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:52.876
And "fun" is an interesting word,

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.776
because I've talked very much about
desperation, loneliness and isolation.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.395
But if you came to our helpline in the UK,
you would also hear laughter.

00:11:00.419 --> 00:11:01.864
Because at the Silver Line,

00:11:01.888 --> 00:11:05.272
we do want to cherish
the wonderful lives of older people

00:11:05.296 --> 00:11:07.498
and all the experiences that they bring.

00:11:07.522 --> 00:11:11.101
So here's an example,
just a snippet of one of our calls.

00:11:11.974 --> 00:11:14.641
(Audio) Good morning,
you're through to the Silver Line.

00:11:14.665 --> 00:11:16.197
My name's Alan, how can I help?

00:11:16.221 --> 00:11:17.800
Woman: Hello, Alan. Good morning.

00:11:17.824 --> 00:11:18.975
Alan: Hello.

00:11:18.999 --> 00:11:20.156
Woman: (Chipper) Hello!

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:21.910
Alan: Oh, how are you this morning?

00:11:21.934 --> 00:11:23.363
Woman: I'm alright, thank you.

00:11:23.387 --> 00:11:24.783
Alan: I'm pleased to hear it.

00:11:24.807 --> 00:11:27.505
Woman: What a wonderful thing
the telephone is, you know?

00:11:28.101 --> 00:11:30.204
Alan: It's a remarkable
invention, isn't it?

00:11:30.228 --> 00:11:32.307
Woman: I remember
when I was a little girl,

00:11:32.331 --> 00:11:33.863
donkey's years ago,

00:11:33.887 --> 00:11:36.783
if you wanted to make
a phone call to somebody,

00:11:36.807 --> 00:11:38.998
you had to go to a shop

00:11:39.022 --> 00:11:41.474
and use the telephone of the shop

00:11:41.498 --> 00:11:45.451
and pay the shop for using the telephone
and have your phone call.

00:11:45.475 --> 00:11:48.164
So you didn't make phone calls
just whenever you fancied.

00:11:48.188 --> 00:11:49.339
Alan: Oh, no.

00:11:49.363 --> 00:11:51.133
Woman: (Coughs) Oh, sorry.

00:11:51.157 --> 00:11:52.426
(Coughs)

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:53.776
Excuse me about that.

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.499
You had to, you know,

00:11:55.523 --> 00:11:58.748
confine your phone calls
to the absolute essentials.

00:11:59.141 --> 00:12:04.788
And now, here I am, sitting in my own home
in my dressing gown still,

00:12:04.812 --> 00:12:07.783
and using the telephone,
isn't it wonderful?

00:12:07.807 --> 00:12:10.309
Alan: It is. (Laughter)

00:12:10.886 --> 00:12:14.283
SA: And that's not untypical of a call
we might receive at our helpline.

00:12:14.307 --> 00:12:16.956
That's someone who really sees us
as part of the family.

00:12:17.727 --> 00:12:20.212
So Silver Line, I guess,
are now helping older people

00:12:20.236 --> 00:12:22.442
in the same way
that Samaritans has helped me.

00:12:22.466 --> 00:12:25.124
They're there 24/7,
they're listening confidentially

00:12:25.148 --> 00:12:27.671
and quite often not giving any advice.

00:12:27.695 --> 00:12:31.307
How often do we really ever listen
without giving advice?

00:12:31.331 --> 00:12:32.664
It's actually quite hard.

00:12:32.688 --> 00:12:35.697
Quite often on the phone calls,
an older person would say,

00:12:35.721 --> 00:12:37.663
"Could you give me some advice, please?"

00:12:37.687 --> 00:12:40.546
And 20 minutes later, they say,
"Thank you for your advice,"

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:42.310
and we realize we haven't given any.

00:12:42.334 --> 00:12:43.335
(Laughter)

00:12:43.359 --> 00:12:45.972
We've listened and listened,
and we haven't interrupted.

00:12:45.996 --> 00:12:48.487
But to that person,
maybe we have given advice.

00:12:48.511 --> 00:12:50.877
We recently conducted
a survey at The Silver Line

00:12:50.901 --> 00:12:54.558
to 3,000 older people, to ask them
what they thought of the service.

00:12:54.582 --> 00:12:56.916
And one person quite simply
came back and said,

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.497
for the first time in her life,

00:12:59.521 --> 00:13:03.307
she had what we would call
in the sport cricket a wicketkeeper,

00:13:03.331 --> 00:13:06.531
and what you would call
in baseball, a catcher.

00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:09.308
I've been here 48 hours,
and I'm talking American.

00:13:09.332 --> 00:13:11.347
They will not recognize me
when I get home.

00:13:11.371 --> 00:13:12.895
(Laughter)

00:13:12.919 --> 00:13:15.656
But for the first time in her life,
she had that catcher,

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.355
which is really, really important.

00:13:17.379 --> 00:13:20.028
And now it's come full circle,
because actually,

00:13:20.052 --> 00:13:22.735
people that are calling Silver Line
and needing a catcher

00:13:22.759 --> 00:13:25.705
are now becoming catchers themselves
by putting something back

00:13:25.729 --> 00:13:28.736
and becoming volunteers
and becoming part of our family.

00:13:29.641 --> 00:13:33.785
So I end my talk, really, where I started,
talking about my own personal experience.

00:13:34.323 --> 00:13:37.704
Because when I talk about my life,
I often say that I've been lucky.

00:13:37.728 --> 00:13:39.861
And people generally ask me why.

00:13:40.212 --> 00:13:42.649
And it's because,
at every stage of my life,

00:13:42.673 --> 00:13:47.110
I have been lucky enough to have someone
alongside me at the right time

00:13:47.134 --> 00:13:48.897
who maybe has believed in me,

00:13:48.921 --> 00:13:50.278
which in turn has helped me

00:13:50.302 --> 00:13:54.124
just to believe a little bit more
in myself, which has been so important.

00:13:55.094 --> 00:13:57.894
And everyone needs a catcher
at some point in their lives.

00:13:58.895 --> 00:14:00.162
This is my catcher.

00:14:00.705 --> 00:14:02.014
So that's Pam.

00:14:02.038 --> 00:14:03.622
And she answered the call to me

00:14:03.646 --> 00:14:07.218
when I was that 14-year-old
in the phone box, over 30 years ago.

00:14:08.973 --> 00:14:13.441
So never, ever underestimate
the power of a simple human connection.

00:14:14.418 --> 00:14:17.580
Because it can be and so often is
the power to save a life.

00:14:18.045 --> 00:14:19.196
Thank you.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.412
(Applause)
