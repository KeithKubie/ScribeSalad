00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.130
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.940
Delighted to see you
all here this afternoon

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.880
at the History Stage at the
2018 National Book Festival.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.550
Welcome. My name is
Becky Brasington Clark,

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.870
I'm the Director of Publishing
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.410
Before we welcome our next
speaker I'd like to ask you

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.170
to take a moment and spend it
with the device in your pocket

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.290
or on your wrist, whether
it's your phone or your watch

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.680
or your camera, anything
that makes noise

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.620
if you can just take a minute
and ask it to be silent.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.130
That would be terrific
for, for all of us here.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.430
Thank you.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.820
So you may not know that
the Manuscript Division

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.420
in the Library of Congress
has the official papers

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.270
of 23 US Presidents.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.890
The Andrew Jackson
collection alone includes more

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.170
than 26,000 items
dating from 1767 to 1874,

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.020
including 13 volumes
of his military papers.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.190
Researchers and writers
who delve

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.350
into such primary source
material often discover little

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.100
known facts or new dimensions
in historical events.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.990
These discoveries, whether
shared in books, documentaries,

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.330
podcasts or movies, keep
us connected to the history

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.950
that continues to
shape our nation today.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.390
History really comes
alive in the works

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.940
of talented storytellers
like Brian Kilmeade.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.160
Fellow bestselling author John
Mecham speaks of Kilmeade's gift

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.740
for narrative and intuitive
feel for great stories.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.610
Indeed, Brian's latest book,
Andrew Jackson and the Miracle

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.110
of New Orleans has received
heaps of phrase from a long list

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.580
of literary luminaries.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.790
Jay Winnick describes
it as a Tour de Force.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.180
Douglas Brinkley calls it a
riveting introduction to one

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.070
of the seminal battles
in US history.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.160
And Brad Meltzer calls it a
wild page turning history of one

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.310
of America's most
fascinating battles.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.200
But nothing speaks as powerfully
to an author's success

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.760
in telling a good story as do
comments from readers like you,

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.280
of the more than 800
reviews I saw online

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.710
for this book, most
have five stars.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.790
One reader wrote, if
more history were related

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.140
in this manner there would
be more history buffs.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.480
Another said, it almost
reads like an action novel.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.590
In fact by the time I got to the
battle I couldn't put it down.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.320
Another said this is a wonderful
and fast read for history buffs

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.620
with an interest in old hickory.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.820
And finally, this action story
is a well-researched page turner

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.240
and it's true.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.590
Now you're going to get
a special treat today

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.220
because Brian is going to take
questions following his remarks

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.040
so if you'll please hold
your questions until the end

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.940
of his talk that would be great.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.170
Please join me in giving a warm
welcome to a passionate student

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.230
of American history and
a gifted storyteller.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.530
Brian Kilmeade.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.720
&gt;&gt; Just want to warn
you I talk fast.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.760
Hey thanks so much
for coming here.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.260
I know there's a lot
of great attractions.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.460
I'm thrilled you guys decided to
spend some quality time with me.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.980
We have some audiovisual
portions of this presentation.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.510
Because I'm a TV guy
with a radio show.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.210
I also like to tell stories.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.630
To give you an idea of
what's coming your direction.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.350
So before the book
launches, Fox News,

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.650
Fox and Friends says hey Bri,

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.390
put together a three minute
piece to give people an idea

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.690
of what they're going to get.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.090
And I'll roll that for you.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.100
When I first started saying
to myself I love to do books,

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.580
I did the games do count.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.210
Because I had a sports
background,

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.790
I was started as a sports guy.

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.560
I thought, if you didn't go
pro did we all waste our time?

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.880
If I didn't become Joe
Montana, am I wasting my time

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.380
when I could be doing
other things?

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.680
And it turns out most

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.680
of us don't become professional
athletes, so what are we doing?

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.940
So I wanted to show
people the games do count.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.980
I talked to 73 people about
what they didn't accomplish is

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.510
sports, but what they tried to,

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.620
but what paid off
later down the line.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.680
Then I came out with a
how you play the game,

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.940
so I wanted to weave in people
of history from Teddy Roosevelt

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.890
to Abraham Lincoln what they
did in sports believe it or not,

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.280
that paid off to what they
became, even to Steve Young,

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.270
and great athletes like Evander
Holyfield and people like you

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.210
and I who didn't go pro
assuming there's not

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.510
professional athletes.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:28.920
And to prove it doesn't matter

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.460
that life is what you
experience, how you handle it.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.090
You might be set
back, but you're never

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.340
down unless you decide
that is it.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.500
And what do you learn from
failure or not getting success

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.500
to come to or come at it from
another direction, go at it,

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.590
go at it again and
don't give up.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.370
After that I was done.

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.500
And then I started understanding
the reason when we were born

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.430
in this country we
really hit the lotto.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.490
We're not a perfect country,
but man we are pretty great.

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.980
And even though we don't,
we do make mistakes,

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:03.050
for the most part, we are on
the path to getting better.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.340
And the reason why people
misinterpret what we're doing

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.420
in this country is because
we have our fights in public.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:09.720
We let it out.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.960
But we all unify behind this
principle of understanding

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.020
that there's no country
like America.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.510
And after reading great history
books from Dave McCullough,

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.530
like John Adams, and seeing him
bring him to life, when he talks

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.270
about John Adams coming into
New York and he is complaining

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.070
that everybody is
rude and in a rush,

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.320
I go wait a second,
they still are.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.160
And I thought wow
history and today,

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.610
if I could bring some
humanity to this story,

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.580
I can't do what Dave
McCullough does.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.370
I can't capture a famous person
like Adams or John Meacham

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.580
when he grabs Push
41, or Andrew Jackson.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.390
I can't-- I don't close that
book and say I could do better,

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:48.690
I'm not that arrogant.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.440
I don't close Grant after
reading Ron Chernow for a book

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.200
and say, wow that was okay.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.960
I think it's great.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.410
So what I thought I would
like to do is point out things

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.660
in America's past
that shows you,

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.130
you and I are what make America.

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.230
As much as we love
the Founding Fathers,

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:04.880
they live up the they hype.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.000
But the people behind the
Founding Fathers made our

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.370
country what it is.

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.790
And that's why I came up and
I looked at this for 20 years.

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:16.920
I got it. George Washington's
Secret Six, the spy ring

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.860
that saved the American
Revolution.

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.890
Those aren't my words,
that's what Washington said.

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:26.300
To see a farmer, a
bartender, a printer which was

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.200
like a journalist, a
grocery store owner

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.820
and a socialite combine forces
in three and a half years,

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.830
to bring down the British and
infiltrate their headquarters

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.160
and do it in a way that helps
us win the battle of Yorktown,

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.290
allow the French to land in
America without being confronted

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:47.570
by the British, while outing
Benedict Arnold before he could

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.960
turn over West Point,
I thought they lived

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.580
and died in anonymity.

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.440
If I could highlight their
struggle on what they did,

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.990
and the credit they didn't get.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:59.860
Maybe I could tell a story
that America could relate to.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.370
And so called average
every day Americans turned

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.450
on average every day
Americans, because the fact is

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:09.440
without us there is
no America as much

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.040
as we love the man on Mount.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.180
Rushmore, the people that made
America are everybody else

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.480
around Mount.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.120
Rushmore. So George
Washington's Secret Six opened

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.910
up what I thought was a venue.

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:24.460
Take the Founding Fathers,
let the geniuses like Meacham

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.450
and Brinkley and
Chernow tell that story.

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:30.930
But what if I bring
out other elements?

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:32.450
So I came up with
Thomas Jefferson

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:33.870
and het Tripoli Pirates.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.190
Now my problem with
Jefferson is he accomplished

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.610
so much, where do you focus?

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:41.020
Every time since 9-11
they tell the story.

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:44.260
They say well this isn't the
first time we had a battle

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.320
with radical Islamists.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.440
And they refer back
to Jefferson.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:49.740
It intrigued me.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:52.690
And the great people at the
Jefferson Library were able

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:55.450
to open up their books
and show me how he took

00:07:55.450 --> 00:08:01.010
on four Muslim nations that
were stealing our ships,

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:04.660
capturing our sailors
and capturing the cargo

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.430
and demanding ransom in return.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:09.140
We wanted to take on this fight.

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:14.070
The only problem was, we
had no army, we had no navy.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:16.480
So I came up with Thomas
Jefferson Tripoli Pirates

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:20.290
because the so called passive
presidents that did so much,

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:22.250
from Secretary of State
to the Declaration

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:23.550
of Independence author.

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:25.690
Never really talked
much about how he took

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:29.680
on this unpopular battle, but in
the end was praised by the pope

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:33.590
of his time and gave America
international prestige.

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:36.970
So here's a look right
now of Thomas Jefferson

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:39.270
and the Tripoli Pirates.

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:45.930
&gt;&gt; In the aftermath of
the Revolutionary war,

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:48.560
America had won independence
from the British.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.910
And that mean no more Royal Navy
to keep it sailor's safe at sea.

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:54.620
The United States
became vulnerable

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.210
to a vicious new enemy whose
extremists ideology we still

00:08:58.210 --> 00:08:59.510
face today.

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:01.810
Islamic Radical Pirates.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.260
The year, 1783, the
United States were freed,

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:08.650
but buried in war debt.

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:10.170
They needed to built an economy

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:13.630
from scratch using their
greatest asset, trade.

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:16.400
The most important passageway,
the Mediterranean Sea.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.530
But danger lurked right off
the North African Coast.

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.170
A new enemy would await.

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:24.950
Pirates from four
Islamic nations, Morocco,

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:28.090
Algiers, Tunas, Tripoli.

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:31.050
Without a navy for protection,
it's merchants were helpless

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:32.670
and vulnerable at sea.

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:35.760
Pirates captured our
ships, plundered our cargo

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.860
and turned the crew
into their slaves.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:41.940
Held for ransom that no new
nation could afford to pay.

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:44.820
Without trade, America's
economy would surely collapse.

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:46.690
Congress tasked two
future Presidents

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:47.990
to come up with a deal.

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:50.070
John Adams and Thomas Jefferson.

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:53.900
They'd need Tripoli's Ambassador
in London face to face.

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.310
The Ambassador was
charming but uncompromising.

00:09:56.310 --> 00:10:00.060
And demanded money for passage.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.680
According to the Quran it
was their God given right.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.280
Both Adams and Jefferson
left the meeting shaken.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.030
They didn't have a
deal on the prisoners,

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:08.330
and they didn't have a deal

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:10.370
on safe passage for
a merchant ships.

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:12.890
Back in the United States they
waited for a recommendation.

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:14.920
And that's where Adams
and Jefferson split.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.500
Adams said we can't
fight them unless we want

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:18.800
to fight them forever.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.250
For Jefferson he says
you can't pay for peace.

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:23.030
He says that the
attacks would start

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:24.770
and the price would only go up.

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:27.440
In this case, Jefferson
was 100 percent correct.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:31.960
The United States would cave to
the pirates, borrowing money.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.640
It would cost them
up to 20 percent

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:37.460
of their national budget, yet
somehow the attacks continued.

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:39.660
When our first President took
office, he would continue

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:40.960
to make the payments,

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.280
but he would also commission
the building of six ships,

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:46.030
including this very one,
the USS Constitution.

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:47.330
What were they like?

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:50.890
Well they had copper bottoms,
they had solid oak sides,

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:52.250
they were fast, they
were strong,

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:54.470
and they were built to fight.

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:56.670
They wouldn't be ready for
the Washington Administration,

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:59.720
Adams would choose not to use
them during his years in office,

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.300
but for Jefferson, he knew
exactly what he was going to do.

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.410
He was going to take
on the barbary nations,

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:08.270
and the first ones to
declare war on us, Tripoli.

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:09.800
Without congressional
approval all

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.980
of Thomas Jefferson's new
navy would be permitted

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:14.620
to do would be to provide
security for the merchant ships

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:16.690
and blockade the Tripoli harbor.

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:19.430
The hope was to stop all
commerce coming in and out.

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:21.010
It strangled the
Tripoli economy.

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:22.820
Have a quick end to
this confrontation.

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:25.570
However, the blockade was
ineffective, it was leaking.

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:27.250
The Tripoli pirates
still had to get through,

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:29.460
the Cruisers had the
dial and the knowledge

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:31.650
and the guts to take
on the navy.

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:35.450
Therefore the quick end to this
clash would go by the boards.

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:38.830
But that would change with this
captain, Edward [inaudible].

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:41.300
The training would get hence.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:45.980
And the confrontation
could begin.

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:47.870
[Inaudible] boys
were brave and brash.

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.590
They confronted the pirates,

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:51.860
harassed their ships
and took them back.

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.610
Even blew up an American
ship, the USS Philadelphia

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:57.190
that the pirates once
claimed as their prize.

00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:59.280
Soon the navy sealed the harbor.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.640
Day after day their cannons
would pound the coast.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.830
But Tripoli's leader
refused to budge.

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:05.450
The navy needed a
more powerful force,

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:08.020
both on water and on land.

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:11.660
Enter William Eaton and a
handful of fearless US marines.

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:14.440
They launched the land war,
recruiting mercenaries,

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.240
enlisting the deposed
Tripoli ruler and his fighters

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.160
to march 500 plus miles on foot.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.840
And after the trek they
took the port city of Derna

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.350
in two and a half hours.

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:26.930
Eaton's stunning success
surprised even Jefferson,

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:28.980
although ultimately his
victories would be stymied

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:30.510
by a surprising source,

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:33.250
an American diplomat
named Tobias Lear.

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:35.460
Lear would cut a premature
peach deal with Tripoli,

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:36.760
stopping William Eaton

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.860
from taking Benghazi
and Tripoli itself.

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.290
In the end it would
be another ten years

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:43.030
and another president before
we ultimately won this war.

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:46.380
But in the end, the message was
sent, America was a naval power,

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:49.010
would fight for liberty and
assert itself as a world leader,

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:51.410
a position we will hold today.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.580
&gt;&gt; So that was the battle
with Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.290
and Tripoli which is Libya,

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:01.130
and at the same time we have
our confrontation with Libya,

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:03.510
the overthrow of Gaddafi,
what's happened since.

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:07.630
And we begin to hear terms like
Tripoli again and Benghazi again

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:09.180
and the confrontation again.

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:10.950
But if you look at
Portugal, you look at Spain,

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:12.790
you look at England, they
had one thing in common.

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:14.680
They wanted no part
of this battle.

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.200
But our country, just a
couple of decades old,

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.960
a couple of years old,
was in a confrontation.

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.620
We had to wait for a president,

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:23.450
we had the Articles
of Confederation.

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:26.020
And once we had that president,
he did not want to act.

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:28.910
The next president says,
we can't fight these guys

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:30.210
because I've seen the
look in their eye,

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:31.510
they're going to fight forever.

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:33.270
And they don't represent
the Muslim people.

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:34.870
These people, the Muslim
people were oppressed

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:36.170
by horrible leaders.

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:37.470
They're great people.

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:40.830
Our ambassadors love the
people of these nations,

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:42.130
but they hated the leaders

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:43.550
because they were
corrupt and oppressive.

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:46.360
For William Eaton,
you know Jefferson,

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.270
you might know Edward
Prebble, but for William Eaton,

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:51.320
here's a guy whose
self-educated,

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:54.410
put himself through
college, became this warrior

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:58.010
and then kept pitching to,
to President Jefferson.

00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:01.730
Hey, Mr. President, I could
go get a handful of marines,

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:04.310
I'll go get some mercenaries
and I'll take these countries.

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:05.610
I know what makes them up.

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:06.910
We'll take them out.

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:08.330
Jefferson said, hey
calm it, calm down,

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:09.630
I got the ships, we'll be okay.

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:13.030
Well just a, a sea war
was not going to do.

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:16.050
Finally gets-- he gets him about
1,000 muskets, a little bit

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:17.850
of money, sends him into Egypt.

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:22.810
He gets a, a land force
together with Presley O'Bannon

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:26.450
and they do something that all
those other nations couldn't do.

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:28.790
They took on the
Muslim terrorists

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:30.090
and they overthrew them.

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:32.400
And when they took Derna,
you know what they said?

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.440
Guys, I'm not your leader, go
do what you want, open up shops,

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:37.740
I'm not going to oppress you.

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:41.360
But we pulled out early again,
leaving those people back

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.230
to the old leadership.

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:44.750
And then it took
Madison to go back,

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:46.590
because the started
taking our guys again,

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:48.170
to settle everything up.

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:50.880
And in case you think this is
an American author thinking

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.180
that America's great,

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:54.200
let me tell you what Pope
Pius said at the time.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.120
And by the way it's
Pope Pius IV,

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.600
I thought three Pope Pius' would
have been enough, but they need

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.530
to go back to Pius again.

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:04.420
The Americans, with a small
force and a short space of time,

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:06.420
have done more for the
cause of Christianity

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:07.920
than the most powerful nations

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:11.140
of Christendom have
done for ages.

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:12.490
So we acted.

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:14.760
The next thing you know
we're in the War of 1812.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:19.080
But I thought also, Jefferson,
a deed thinker, an intellectual,

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.480
who was asked to get
a militia together

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.510
for the Revolutionary War
said, I'm more of a thinker.

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:26.470
He knew the rest of
the world was watching.

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:29.950
And Jefferson said this,
weakness provokes insult

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:33.710
and injury, a condition to
punish and it often prevents.

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:36.010
I think in our interest,
it's in our interest

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:37.590
to punish the first insult,

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:41.990
because insult unpunished is
the parent of many others.

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:44.920
That is why he said
we had to fight.

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.790
Adams had a great argument,
we didn't have much of a navy,

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:49.090
they weren't experienced.

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:50.390
And guess what America did?

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:54.170
Started off strong, got it
wrong, rotated out our admirals,

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:55.500
got the right guys in there,

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:57.830
got better coordination
and sent a message.

00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:01.060
And I would argue, without that
message we don't have this much

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:04.230
naval success in
the War of 1812.

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:06.010
So that book seems to resonate,

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:08.500
and our hope is we'll be
announcing a three part series

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.240
on the History Channel shortly.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.860
Keep your fingers
crossed if you can,

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:14.510
because I think it's
an important story

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:16.220
that has to be told.

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:20.200
So then I thought, what would
be great to talk about next?

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.030
I don't know if anyone here
has toured the White House?

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:24.570
Have you guys toured it?

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:29.070
Well I had a chance to tour it,
and they showed me the archway

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:31.040
where they burned the
White House to the ground,

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.770
and the original
flames are still there.

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:34.070
It's right by the bowling alley.

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:35.690
If you ever get a
chance check it out,

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:38.700
because they wanted America
to remember how close it came

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:40.070
to all coming to an end.

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:42.120
Well when we had
social studies class,

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.830
I could not get enough
of the War of 1812.

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:47.300
I could not understand why we
didn't spend much more time

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:48.600
on it.

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:49.900
Well it was a draw, they
signed a peace treaty,

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:51.200
they had this battle afterwards.

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:54.270
You know with-- some people
said it was an unnecessary war.

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:55.990
Well the more I studied it,

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:57.880
the more I realized
how close we came

00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:59.530
to utter extinction
and division.

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:03.290
I mean for the most part,
the vote was overwhelming,

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:06.340
but the northern states didn't
want any part of this war.

00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:07.640
They said, hey you
know what England,

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.930
if you don't attack us maybe
we'll go back with you.

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:11.810
We're tried of the
Jefferson embargo.

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:13.930
I'm not really into
taking you guys on.

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:15.850
And we just want to get
our economy growing.

00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:18.950
And most of the votes
came from the south.

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:21.890
So when the war started we had a
very little army and we thought

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:25.410
to ourselves, wait a second,
let's take on England,

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:28.570
we think they're taking our
sailors against our will,

00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:30.190
so we're going to take them on.

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:32.770
Let's send our army up
to Canada to fight them.

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:34.230
It doesn't seem like
a great idea.

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:35.530
It wasn't.

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:38.420
We left our whole east
seaboard wide open.

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:39.720
What do the British do?

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.020
Terrorize.

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.320
We're losing badly.

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:44.270
Jackson put his hand
up early and said,

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:47.810
I've got a militia I want to
fight, I want to get revenge.

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:49.550
So please call on me.

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:52.660
The Virginia base said,
no, we got this handled.

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:53.960
They didn't.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.170
Sooner or later they
had to call on Jackson.

00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:59.370
So this is the story that led to
the battle that I think is one

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:01.680
of the most biggest
upsets in military history,

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:04.360
certainly in American
history, and can I just say

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.870
on a partisan basis,
I'm glad we won.

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:10.310
Here is Andrew Jackson and
the Miracle of New Orleans.

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:16.050
&gt;&gt; The War of 1812,
America's second war

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:19.380
of independence was going
terribly for the United States.

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:21.960
&gt;&gt; We were so weak, we've
got just the worst generals,

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.350
we've got no plan.

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:25.200
&gt;&gt; The British, the
world's premiere economic

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.880
and military power,
thirsted for a second shot

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.230
at destroying America

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:32.360
after losing the Revolutionary
War 23 years earlier.

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:35.210
The most perilous and bleak
time for the United States?

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:37.580
The invasion and
burning of Washington,

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:39.660
including the White House.

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:40.960
&gt;&gt; But here is the hermitage,

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:43.290
Major General Andrew
Jackson was seething.

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:46.000
And his country was
losing this war badly.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.620
America needed a leader.

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:50.460
Without a standing army,
for President Madison,

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:53.170
America's utter future
hung in the balance.

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:55.320
He found his leader in Jackson.

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:56.620
His greatest challenge?

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:59.340
Stopping the British forces
from taking New Orleans.

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:01.100
&gt;&gt; He lost New Orleans

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.070
and if the British
controlled the great city,

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:06.660
you lose the entire Mississippi
River and you lose all

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:10.020
of our western frontier that we
acquired through the purchase.

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:13.350
So we wouldn't have been
able to do western expansion.

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:18.060
&gt;&gt; The plan, build a wall, dig
a canal, fill it with water,

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:20.820
and wait for a British charge.

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:24.210
This berm, this protection,
this wall was built in a matter

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:27.210
of weeks, miles long to
protect Andrew Jackson

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:28.510
and the American troops.

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:31.420
Over there, with
thousands of British troops,

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.430
what they wanted
that was New Orleans.

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:34.730
What's at stake?

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:36.030
The future of the country.

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:39.680
&gt;&gt; His mishmash of troops that
comes in part Choctaw Indians,

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:43.630
Kentucky and Tennessee militia,
[inaudible], rifles and free men

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:47.260
of color, they're not going to
go out and engage the British.

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.580
Jackson knows that
would be suicide.

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:52.410
&gt;&gt; Any expert would tell you
Jackson's ragtag army would need

00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:55.010
a miracle to stop the British
from spending Christmas

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:57.610
on Bourbon Street,
and Jackson knew just

00:19:57.610 --> 00:20:00.060
where to go to ask for it.

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:01.970
&gt;&gt; Why would I be outside
a convent when I'm trying

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:03.610
to tell the Battle
of New Orleans?

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:05.970
Because this isn't just any
convent, this is the home

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:08.820
of the Ursuline Nuns, it
dates back hundreds of years.

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:10.500
They prayed for Jackson's
success.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.580
And among the people who think

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:15.180
that these nuns brought
his a miraculous victory?

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:17.830
Major General Andrew
Jackson himself.

00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:20.560
&gt;&gt; It's the miracle, it's
praying for a miracle,

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:22.860
the Catholic Church and
the Battle of New Orleans.

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:26.030
I mean that is where we know

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:27.640
that there was divine
intervention.

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.900
&gt;&gt; And that divine
intervention would reveal itself

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:34.240
in the final fight
January 8, 1815.

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.540
&gt;&gt; This becomes a
blood bath here.

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:39.330
The purposes, now we're
just in a green grass.

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:41.820
It was the beginning
of the end of Britain

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:44.380
and in many ways the
birth of modern America.

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:46.810
&gt;&gt; Jackson's forceful
leadership would help record one

00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:48.130
of the most decisive

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:52.690
and stunning upset
victories in military history.

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:55.340
But Andrew Jackson left
his estate, before the War

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:57.370
of 1812, he was known locally.

00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:58.670
When he was done
winning the Battle

00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:01.000
of New Orleans he
became a national star.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.430
Maybe the most famous
person in America.

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:06.200
But more importantly his wins
sent a message to the rest

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.550
of the world, that we
would fight relentlessly

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:10.650
and furiously for freedom.

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:13.020
As for Jackson, he would
ride that fame for two terms

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:16.000
in the White House and go down
as one of the most consequential

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.270
and influential Americans
in our history.

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:23.590
&gt;&gt; And that's this the hard
back that came out last year,

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:25.890
Andrew Jackson, the
Miracle of New Orleans.

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:30.850
So if you think about it, the
army that just beat Napoleon,

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:33.850
Wellington's invincibles, they
get together and they say,

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:35.250
let's just wipe out America.

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:39.440
Let's stop America from growing
past the Mississippi River.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:42.810
We are going to stay and we're
going to stop this growth.

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:44.920
They saw us as a rival,
they saw the potential

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:48.100
that we could have, and
they thought they had it.

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:51.470
Now in case you thought that
I'm overestimating that,

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:53.730
here's what the British
Foreign Secretary said,

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:56.400
while they're trying to
negotiate the Treaty of Ghent.

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:59.360
I expect, at this moment, that
most of the large seaport towns

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.260
of America are laid to ashes,
that we're in possession

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:05.040
of New Orleans and have command
of the Mississippi Valley,

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.640
that Mississippi
River and lakes.

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.750
And that the Americans
are now little better

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:11.260
than prisoners in
their own country.

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:14.610
So what stopped that
from happening?

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:15.910
Andrew Jackson.

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:18.240
This instinctive
military leadership.

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.330
He didn't come from
the academies.

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:24.580
The guy was brought up outside
the so-called Virginia base,

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:27.550
or the Boston power base.

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:28.850
Either one of these.

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:31.860
He was the first outside to
actually rise to prominence.

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:33.330
And what did he go through?

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:36.030
And I didn't realize this
until I started researching it.

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:38.130
What he went thorough
was the ultimate

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:40.880
and maybe the first
rags to riches story.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.870
I mean his parents come
here from Scotland.

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:45.700
His dad dies before he was born.

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:47.590
His mom raises three kids

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:50.340
by just basically being a
housekeeper for other people,

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:53.270
doing whatever she can to
get through, very tough times

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:56.040
in the Tennessee /
South Carolina area.

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.440
And then when a time for
the war, of the older son,

00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:00.750
they knew one thing they
didn't like the British

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:02.400
because they're Scottish.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.700
He goes to fight.

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:05.420
He dies of heat stroke.

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:09.120
So the two, 13 and 14 years
old, Robert and Andrew,

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:12.020
start becoming couriers
in the Revolutionary War.

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:15.050
Well they get caught,
followed back to a house,

00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:17.430
and the British soldier
says clean my boots

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:19.650
to both brothers,
and they both say no.

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:22.940
Up come up the sword,
down goes the sword,

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:25.520
right to the brother's
head, a direct hit.

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:28.550
Andrew puts his hand up,
he'd have the scar the rest

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:31.090
of his life, but he was
able to parry the blow.

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:33.760
They went to prison,
after walking 20 miles,

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.930
after they take their
shoes off, in the winter.

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:37.320
They spent a couple
of years there.

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:38.700
But you know what stopped them?

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:40.620
The mom was relentless
to get them out.

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:42.980
But by the time they
got back to their house,

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:45.910
they were so sick
that Robert died.

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:49.000
And it's just Andrew
and his mom.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.910
So they need money.

00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:53.490
So she goes to a
cousin to earn money.

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:57.220
A trunk ends up on the doorstep
of Andrew Jackson's house.

00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:58.620
It's his mom's stuff.

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:02.040
He still lived and died
without knowing how she died.

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:04.910
He is alone at 14 years old.

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:06.940
A war veteran you could say.

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:11.120
He was raised by his town,
he was raised by his village,

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.030
he was raised by his country.

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:15.610
Therefore he bled
red, white and blue.

00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:19.820
He became a self-taught
lawyer, a judge, a congressman,

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:23.090
a senator, a major general
and then when the War

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:25.940
of 1812 happened,
what is he thinking?

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:28.970
Revenge. Put me in coach.

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:30.270
They didn't.

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:32.710
You're a backwoodsman, you don't
really know what you're doing.

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:34.900
You didn't go to West Pointe.

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:36.880
But he could lead,
he couldn't get

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:40.960
through when all the other
guys failed, he got through.

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:43.740
And all he did was roll,
roll off battle win,

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:46.050
after battle win, but
he knew they were going

00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:47.350
to go for New Orleans.

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:49.080
But he didn't have enough guys.

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.770
So he had to get free
men of color, Cassian's,

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:53.970
make a deal with local pirates,

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:57.090
had Tennessee riflemen,
Kentucky riflemen.

00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:58.660
He put them together
in three weeks.

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:01.040
He got the whole
town to dig a ditch.

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:03.590
And if just in case he walked
into New Orleans and felt

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:06.280
as though they weren't
all in, he let them know.

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:09.350
If you don't fight with me I'm
burning this town to the ground.

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:12.070
It turns out they were
all in after that.

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:15.570
Then he said, the British
are going to land here.

00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:17.260
What do I do?

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:18.740
Stop here.

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:21.530
What happens if we don't, if
they get through our first line?

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:23.380
Dig another line.

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:26.900
Told them there's no
substitute for winning.

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:29.200
They knew by the time
this battle started they

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.500
couldn't miss.

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:31.800
You know what they had better?

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:34.090
They had better riflemen,
they were more determined,

00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:35.860
because the British
were not fighting

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:38.930
for their freedom they were
fighting to stop growth

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:41.410
of a free nation, many
of which wanted to stay

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:43.190
and ended up staying here.

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:45.740
So listen to these numbers.

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:53.870
In under 45 minutes, we
have 13 dead they have 291.

00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:58.210
We have 5,300 fighters
they have 10,000.

00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:05.750
We have 39 wounded, they
have 1,262, 484 are missing

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:07.620
which means essentially
they were blown apart.

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:11.200
We took out three generals,
seven colonels, 75 officers.

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.450
So why is it that
Andrew Jackson was able

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:15.550
to do what Napoleon couldn't?

00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:18.960
Because I believe on some
level America was meant

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:21.910
for something special, to the,
to be the beacon of freedom

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:24.000
of the world it doesn't
mean we're perfect,

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.440
but it means we're like no other

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:28.280
and it means we have a
responsibility to do so.

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:31.560
And for those who say the battle
did not have to be taught,

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:33.740
because that's what they
taught us in school,

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:36.330
this is what Jackson said.

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:39.090
If General Pakenham, which by
the way was the brother-in-law

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:40.390
of Wellington.

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:42.720
Wellington's like yeah, I fought
already, I'm not into going

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:44.670
to America, but you're
my brother-in-law,

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:47.110
so why don't you take my
army and go, and you can stay

00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:49.090
and be the governor,
it'll be easy.

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:50.390
It wasn't.

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:53.150
General Pakenham and his
10,000 matched with veterans,

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:55.530
if they could have alienated
my little army he would have

00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:56.830
captured New Orleans

00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:59.470
and sentried all the
contiguous territory,

00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:01.320
so technically the war was over,

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.360
Great Britain would have
immediately aggregated the

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:06.090
treaty again, would have
ignored Jefferson's transaction

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:07.390
with Napoleon.

00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:10.560
That means no Louisiana
Purchase.

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:11.860
It means the country of--

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:14.070
our country wouldn't
have doubled in size.

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:15.890
It means our Washington
was burned,

00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:18.730
our five foot three inch
president was on his own.

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:21.570
Our records were scattered
out throughout the country.

00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:24.190
We were over, we were
finished we were through.

00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:27.570
If not for this 14 year old
who finally found a way to get

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:30.060
out of prison thanks
to a relentless mom,

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:32.360
who was determined to
pay back his country,

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:33.900
and pay back the British.

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.370
I did not know when
I dove into this

00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:37.960
that I'd come out with this.

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:40.430
I did not know I'd be talking
about what I thought was one

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:41.850
of the original American
success story

00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:43.310
and the promise of
our country as.

00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:47.370
That if you do whatever you
can, if you believe in yourself,

00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:49.280
and you are determined
to be successful,

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:52.550
you'll have the opportunity
to pursue happiness/success.

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:54.260
That's what he was
trying to say.

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:56.340
And when he rose up
through the ranks,

00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:59.520
he wasn't representing the
rich, the famous, the powerful,

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:02.640
he was representing the
so-called average every day

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.400
Americans doing extraordinary
things

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:06.070
to keep our country alive.

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:07.370
Was he perfect?

00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:08.670
No. I'm not debating
his presidency,

00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:12.270
that's for John Mecham, he's
really smart with better hair.

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:16.500
I wanted to grab the
moment in which he emerged

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:21.230
at 40 something years old, as
the most famous man in America.

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:23.360
Now when Donald Trump
puts his picture

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:26.000
in the Oval Office
he becomes a story.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.760
In the paperback that
comes out in two months,

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:33.170
I decided as my excerpt to
not debate Andrew Jackson,

00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:36.320
what kind of President
he was, and what he did.

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.150
Because back then
when people now are,

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:40.860
are revisiting our history
and think we know more,

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:43.580
and I think we're coming off
as a very arrogant generation

00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:45.660
that looks back and
says how could they,

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:47.850
no one defends slavery,
no one ever will.

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:50.660
No one defends fighting
the Civil War

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:54.230
and saying wow the south
was right, no one ever will.

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:57.370
But understand these
people were, were monuments

00:28:57.370 --> 00:29:01.030
in their time, put up by people
in their day for a reason,

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:04.140
and when you look at
Jackson we're revisiting him.

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:06.560
So I thought I'd
revisit him with this.

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:12.540
Lincoln, FDR, Teddy Roosevelt,
Harry Truman, Ronald Reagan,

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:16.970
when asked who they looked
to most in times of trouble,

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:22.220
and for setting out an agenda,
those men looked at that man.

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:24.520
Did they look at him
because he was perfect?

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:28.970
No. Did they look at him because
he was a self-made American

00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:32.510
success story that defined
leadership in its own way?

00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:35.220
Knew how to consolidate
power, and get things done

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:37.790
and he cared more about the
everyday people than he did

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:41.010
about political power
and prestige.

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:44.910
And once he left office, he
had a lot of power afterwards.

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:47.850
So when Harry Truman took
office, he had a figurine

00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:49.320
of Jackson on his desk.

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:54.040
Before World War II, FDR in all
his pain, locked in his braces

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:55.790
and walked up the steps to go

00:29:55.790 --> 00:30:00.360
to the hermitage before he
put our nation again at war.

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:03.170
When Ronald Reagan chose to give
a speech after being elected,

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:05.460
he did it in front of
the Jackson statute.

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:08.130
When Lincoln wanted to know how
to keep our country together,

00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:11.090
he looked back at Jackson's
papers, because Jackson said

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:13.300
to South Caroline,
oh you want to leave,

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:14.600
you got about one week.

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:16.780
Because if you decide to
leave, I'm sending troops

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:18.150
in to make sure you stay.

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:19.880
He was going to keep
the union together.

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:22.590
It's exactly like
Lincoln did, no?

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:25.070
But there was something
to learn there.

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:26.920
So I through Teddy
Roosevelt too,

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:31.260
when he had to do a biography,
he chose Andrew Jackson.

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:36.810
So I choose to take on passage
of where Andrew Jackson emerged

00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:39.820
and a victory that people
still can't makes sense of,

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:42.320
they still teach
about in war colleges.

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:44.430
My next project, which I
hope you're enthusiastic

00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:47.040
about which I can't get enough
of, and no one wants to hang

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:48.800
out with me because I can't
stop talking about it.

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.950
Do you ever get that when
you're in the middle of a book,

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:52.400
or in the middle of research?

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.420
All you do is think
and talk about that?

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:56.720
Because I'm very, very
simple, I pretty much think

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.020
on one track all the time.

00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:00.910
But I'm doing Sam Houston
avenging the Alamo.

00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:04.710
And the link to Sam
Houston and Jackson

00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:08.420
to see Sam Houston fighting
in the Creek War for Jackson,

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:11.420
getting wounded, Jackson walking
over to the sick bay and saying,

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:13.110
I need more guys
to finish them off.

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:16.510
And he gets up and fights
again, gets shot again.

00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:18.360
They send him back to
Washington to heal,

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:19.660
it's burned to the ground.

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:20.980
They think he's going to die.

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:23.200
He lives. Jackson
would mentor him.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.260
So I thought it would
be a perfect next step

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:28.490
and to see what Texas
has done is fascinating.

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:31.850
I always thought you had to
be from Texas to study Texas

00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:33.820
because they get
kind of resentful.

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:35.530
For a New Yorker to do it.

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:38.500
But I'm finding nothing but open
arms, and I cannot wait to tell

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:39.870
that story, and I
hope you like it.

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:41.850
What I try to do in my books,

00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:44.280
I don't try to impress
you with a vocabulary.

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:46.600
I don't try to get you
caught up in the background

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:48.680
and the smell in the air.

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:51.030
And some people don't like that.

00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:54.900
What I try to do is tell a story
that's accurate but concise

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:56.760
that makes you want
to study more.

00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:59.120
I don't think I can do
the definitive biography,

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:02.600
even on myself, but I
think I can grab a slice

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:06.180
of what made these men and women
great, and tell you the story.

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:09.940
Because really the supporting
cast matters so much.

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:11.610
We are the supporting casts.

00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:12.910
We're not on Mount.

00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:14.210
Rushmore, but we matter.

00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:16.790
And that's what I try
to do with the books,

00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:18.330
and people have been
kind enough to get them.

00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:20.170
And I just love telling
the story.

00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:22.330
And I never thought history
would be so under attack

00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:24.590
as it is today, so I never
thought there would be

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:27.010
so much news about
things in the past.

00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:28.310
But it's here.

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:30.430
And I'm still going to
say America's not perfect,

00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:33.810
but man we're special and
I will always believe that.

00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:36.430
And I believe all of us, even
if we were the biggest critic

00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:39.530
of this country, we hit
lotto when we were born here.

00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:41.650
Everyday we're allowed
to thrive here.

00:32:41.650 --> 00:32:43.280
We're all in the Super Bowl.

00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:45.960
So with that I like you to
come up to the microphone

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:47.530
and tell me how I'm wrong.

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:49.200
Or tell me what you like.

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:53.120
Or ask any questions about
the book and/or the radio show

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:56.150
or Fox in the morning,
whatever you want.

00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:58.370
So unless you are
a really shy group,

00:32:58.370 --> 00:33:01.480
which I understand you're
not, because I can't even get

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:03.430
on the elevator,
because everyone's

00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:05.170
so loud and deliberate.

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:06.710
But I appreciate it.

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:08.010
Yes.

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:09.310
&gt;&gt; I'm not shy.

00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:13.030
I think you gave a great speech
and I think it's very important

00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:18.820
that we recognize the
humanity of people in history,

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:20.760
both the good and the bad.

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:25.900
But I really need to push back
on your view on the monuments

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:27.830
that were erected to them.

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:32.610
Most of those Civil War
monuments were erected after,

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:38.860
way after the Civil War,
as a way of putting blacks

00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:42.850
in their place, and
reminding them.

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:53.060
And reminding them of their
history in a negative way.

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:57.540
I'm not for getting rid
of the monuments but I am

00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:00.720
for putting history in context--

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.270
&gt;&gt; Well lets' talk about this.

00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:03.570
Great point.

00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:06.530
And if you read Grant
it really comes home.

00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:07.830
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:10.540
&gt;&gt; Because reconstruction is so
underappreciated, underreported.

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:13.040
As a white guy whose family
wasn't even in America

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:14.340
at the time, I'm horrified

00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:16.340
that a country this great
could rationalize slavery,

00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:17.640
to be honest.

00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:18.940
I don't know what
to say about it.

00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:20.430
And I think a lot
of white people

00:34:20.430 --> 00:34:22.890
in America feel the
exact same way.

00:34:22.890 --> 00:34:26.350
But I love, like I
interviewed Jim Brown '80--

00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:29.370
I did a show with
him for five years.

00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:31.880
I interviewed him Tuesday.

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:34.700
And he said yeah he
came from slavery

00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:36.720
but look how far we've come.

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:38.420
And he says, when it comes

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:43.880
to back then no one will
ever justify slavery,

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:49.840
but in 2018 he says if a white
person in Manhasset didn't pay

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:51.460
for my school without
telling me,

00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:53.920
I wouldn't have become the
running back from Syracuse.

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:56.880
He says, a lot of white people
have died because slavery was

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:58.850
so wrong and they
wanted to fix it.

00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:00.150
So I'm not going to put that.

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:02.690
I cannot-- Douglas Brinkley
I think said it best.

00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:04.650
He said, we can take
the confederate statutes

00:35:04.650 --> 00:35:07.820
and put it separate
from past presidents.

00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:10.670
For example, if you are
a confederate general

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:13.750
and you fought to keep
slavery intact, if I'm black

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:17.190
and I looked at that every day,
I'd have a problem with that.

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:20.950
But if you look at
Jefferson, Washington, Madison,

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:24.670
Monroe I believe, everyone
except Adams I think

00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:27.270
in our first to eight
Presidents, they had slaves.

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:28.970
I can't rationalize that.

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:31.940
I could say at 30 they
were geniuses, but for them

00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:34.040
to make sense of
that, I can't do it.

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:37.220
But I think, and I don't
know your name, I'm sorry.

00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:39.150
&gt;&gt; CQ Tillery.

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:41.700
&gt;&gt; Hi, that's the, CQ Hillary.

00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:43.000
&gt;&gt; Tillery.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.300
&gt;&gt; Tillery.

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:45.650
But I would say this,
I would love,

00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:48.400
I thought the 60 Minute
special was great,

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:51.610
and can we put a plaque
next to the statute

00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:57.260
that says they also sadly had 26
slaves, or rationalized slavery

00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:59.880
for somehow put that
along with it.

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:02.780
But I think you take down
Jefferson in Washington and,

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:07.480
and, and Madison and
Monroe, and Jackson,

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:10.330
I think to diminish
them as great leaders,

00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:12.760
acknowledge the slaves
or the slavery was wrong,

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:15.010
but to diminish as great
leaders I think we're in danger

00:36:15.010 --> 00:36:16.310
of losing our history.

00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:19.240
&gt;&gt; And maybe you didn't hear
me, that's exactly what I said--

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:20.540
&gt;&gt; Great.

00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:22.920
&gt;&gt; I said it needs to
be placed into context.

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:26.590
And I think that along with
some of those Civil War leaders

00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:30.320
and generals, we need to put
up a statute to Harriet Tubman,

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:33.370
the first woman, black or
white that led a regiment

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:36.070
of soldiers into combat.

00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:37.370
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:40.160
&gt;&gt; We need to acknowledge
that it was African slaves

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:46.270
that shared the, the
cure for smallpox.

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:50.880
We would have lost the American
Revolution had we not had the

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:52.290
smallpox injections, because--

00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:53.590
&gt;&gt; Did not know that.

00:36:53.590 --> 00:36:54.890
Okay.

00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:56.190
&gt;&gt; Soldiers were dying of that.

00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:59.750
But women and blacks

00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:05.210
and Mexicans have become hidden
figures in American history.

00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:09.720
And when we unveil those
hidden figures along

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:11.020
with the people that--

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:12.320
&gt;&gt; I hear you.

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:16.050
&gt;&gt; We accept, then we
have the whole picture

00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:19.460
of what makes America
great and continues--

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:20.760
&gt;&gt; Great, thank you.

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.060
&gt;&gt; To make it great.

00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:24.360
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:30.800
&gt;&gt; I hate to follow
that, that was beautiful.

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:32.100
So thank you.

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:35.830
I'm just concerned
with Jackson's wife.

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:38.060
I don't know if she
had been married prior,

00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:39.490
but there's a big
scandal around her--

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:40.790
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:42.090
&gt;&gt; And their romance.

00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:43.390
And I just wanted to know

00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:44.690
if you had done any
research on that or--

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:46.650
&gt;&gt; Not heavily, but by the
way they have life size things

00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:48.160
at the hermitage of the wife.

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:50.870
The wife was like 4'9",
he was like 6'3"--

00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:52.170
&gt;&gt; Yeah she was Rachel.

00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:53.480
&gt;&gt; It was, yeah, yes Rachel.

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:56.080
And the way I understand it he,
she had an abusive marriage.

00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:57.380
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:58.680
&gt;&gt; She got out of it, the
paperwork wasn't done perfectly.

00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:01.120
He got married, and they tried
to pin that scandal on him.

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:02.420
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:03.720
&gt;&gt; Like Sam Houston, for
example, had a, had a marriage

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:05.170
that lasted two weeks.

00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:06.470
He couldn't shake that.

00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:08.380
They basically told
him resign as governor

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:11.410
so those are the good old
days in terms of scandals.

00:38:11.410 --> 00:38:12.710
But that was in it, so more

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:14.370
of a paperwork thing,
the first husband.

00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:16.200
They tried to sully
who they became.

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:17.700
But you know what
when I see about--

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:20.230
hear about Ronald and
Nancy Reagan and you read

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:25.360
about those two, Rachel and
Andrew Jackson, it makes you--

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:28.240
they are such a great
marriage, these, these two had

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:29.580
such great marriages,

00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:31.890
they really got their
strength from each other.

00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:33.880
And I think the women
are so underappreciated.

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:36.080
&gt;&gt; Yeah that's what I, I guess
that was my point was that,

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:37.900
I think she went through
a lot of strife because--

00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:39.200
&gt;&gt; She had a heart attack too.

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:42.960
&gt;&gt; Right. Because of her
situation and I just wanted

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:44.490
to know if you had
any information

00:38:44.490 --> 00:38:45.800
about her and her life?

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:47.100
&gt;&gt; A couple of things.

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:48.730
She did not want to
go to the Washington,

00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:51.060
but went out to pick a
dress for the inauguration,

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:52.700
and basically had a
heart attack right after.

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:55.190
So he ends up going
to Washington with a,

00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:58.950
with his niece and
nephew and they were--

00:38:58.950 --> 00:39:01.560
they were his, his confidants.

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:03.480
Because when he got
to Washington,

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:04.810
no one wanted him there.

00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:06.110
They didn't like him there.

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:07.430
They thought he wasn't
worthy of the office.

00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:10.010
John Quincy Adams wasn't
even there when the,

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:11.470
to transfer the power.

00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:12.770
He left early.

00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:14.710
But Jackson got there,
no security,

00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:17.210
they wrecked the place,
like it was a frat house.

00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:18.530
So they had to protect Jackson

00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:21.310
from his own so-called
friends, every day people.

00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:23.000
So we know some of that.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.060
Some of the similarities with
Trump and Jackson were true

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:28.780
and that he was despised
by Washington, DC.

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:32.000
He was despised by
Virginia and Boston.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.590
So there are some similarities
between the two in that respect.

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:37.530
&gt;&gt; Right. Well thank you for
that information about the wife.

00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:38.830
Thank you.

00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:40.130
&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks,
Rachel Donaldson.

00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:42.430
Any other questions?

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:46.660
Yes.

00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:50.220
&gt;&gt; We'll just go with this,
this, want to just go ahead

00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:52.150
and step up sir and
then he'll come.

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:53.870
&gt;&gt; Yeah I want to
know what about the,

00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:55.930
what was the existing
diplomatic structure

00:39:55.930 --> 00:39:59.150
between the great powers
and the barbary pirates.

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:02.210
So why was Spain and Portugal
they were clearly paying

00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:03.510
them off.

00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:04.810
And you know trades been going

00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:06.570
through the Mediterranean
for thousands--

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:07.870
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:09.170
&gt;&gt; Of years.

00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:11.630
What really made the
US, sparked it to,

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:13.140
to go against the grain there?

00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:15.120
&gt;&gt; Here's, here's what,
first it wasn't right away.

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:16.650
As you know, in the beginning

00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:23.000
of 1789 we started having our
first, our first clashes, 1783,

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.810
excuse me, 1785, 1783 we
started, 1785 is starts,

00:40:27.810 --> 00:40:32.330
1789 we get a president
to make a decision.

00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:33.700
We really had no
ambassadors there.

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:36.390
We started putting ambassadors.

00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:39.910
One of the ambassadors
ended up being a guy

00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:42.190
that was captive for years.

00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:46.630
He actually went back and went,
what we had was an embassy.

00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:51.160
We tried rationalizing, but the
whole meeting and I don't know

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:54.670
if I characterized correctly
but I do in the book.

00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:57.110
So Jefferson's in
France, Adams in England.

00:40:57.110 --> 00:41:00.670
Adams goes, I had a
great conversation

00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:02.870
with the ambassador of Tripoli.

00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:04.550
He ought to come
over there you, this,

00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:06.620
you know you're a better
writer, come on over,

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:07.920
let's just lock this deal up.

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:09.920
By the time they lock it up they
realize they're charging three

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:11.680
times what we're charge, what
everybody else has been charged,

00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:15.130
because they believe
like the rest of Europe.

00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:17.330
Europe, many people
think this is the hands

00:41:17.330 --> 00:41:22.500
of Britain behind him to say,
charge these guys to the hilt,

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:25.000
they're not going
to be able to pay

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.330
and let's start taking their
ships, destroying their economy

00:41:28.330 --> 00:41:31.060
because they can get their
feet underneath them.

00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:34.590
By the time Adams and Jefferson
get into office they do end

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:36.610
up having ambassadors there.

00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:41.320
One was given two weeks to get
out of town or you're going

00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:43.620
to be held prisoner,
so he just left.

00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:48.720
One other thing that I'll add,
when they started to declare

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:51.320
on you and it was
Tripoli that did it,

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:53.380
they chopped down
your flag pole.

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:57.740
And when Tripoli went to do
it, they couldn't get it down.

00:41:57.740 --> 00:41:59.040
After like two hours the
ceremony kind of ended

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:00.450
and they ended up bending
it like the next day or two.

00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:01.750
But we tried to rationalize it.

00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:03.050
We tried to make payments.

00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:04.350
We were late on everything.

00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:05.650
It made it extremely
stressful with the ambassadors.

00:42:05.650 --> 00:42:06.950
Number three, when
Jefferson took over, he said,

00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:08.250
all payments stop,
let's see what happens.

00:42:08.250 --> 00:42:09.550
And what happens is
they declare war.

00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:10.850
Jefferson goes, now
I got no choice I got

00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:12.150
to go in with my ships.

00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:13.450
I'll blockade.

00:42:13.450 --> 00:42:14.750
If he basically baited them
into declaring war on us,

00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:16.050
because when the
payments stopped.

00:42:16.050 --> 00:42:17.350
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:42:17.350 --> 00:42:18.650
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:19.950
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:21.250
&gt;&gt; Yes. Hello.

00:42:21.250 --> 00:42:22.760
Let's see where to start.

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:24.200
&gt;&gt; I only have a
couple of minutes.

00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:25.500
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:26.800
&gt;&gt; I might want to
get another question.

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:28.100
Two minutes.

00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:29.400
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:30.700
&gt;&gt; Okay I got one minute.

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:32.000
&gt;&gt; Okay so I just want
to say real quick.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.300
No one is attacking history.

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:34.610
When, when we look back at
things, and we try to point

00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:40.050
out discrepancies and
people that were there

00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:43.570
and did also did great
things and were not included

00:42:43.570 --> 00:42:45.270
and remembered in the same way.

00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:46.920
That's not attacking history.

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:50.140
Okay. So that, that's,
that's the first thing.

00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:51.820
The second thing is for
you to draw a line--

00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:53.950
&gt;&gt; No you can, no you,
no, no just a second.

00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:55.250
&gt;&gt; Can I finish?

00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:56.550
&gt;&gt; No you know, just
you said we.

00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:57.850
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:42:57.850 --> 00:42:59.150
&gt;&gt; You represent you.

00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:00.450
&gt;&gt; I understand that.

00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:01.750
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:03.050
&gt;&gt; I understand that.

00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:04.350
And you represent you.

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:05.650
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:43:05.650 --> 00:43:06.950
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:08.250
&gt;&gt; So when you say
we are attacking

00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:09.550
who are you representing?

00:43:09.550 --> 00:43:10.850
&gt;&gt; Okay you--

00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:12.150
&gt;&gt; So just--

00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:13.450
&gt;&gt; You said that there is
an arrogance now of people

00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:14.750
that are coming out
and attacking history.

00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:16.050
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:43:16.050 --> 00:43:17.350
&gt;&gt; Okay and I'm saying
that that's incorrect.

00:43:17.350 --> 00:43:19.000
&gt;&gt; Okay tell me real quick.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.540
Tell me what you think.

00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:22.970
&gt;&gt; Okay. Well I, I,
like I just said.

00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:25.170
For the, the woman that
first came up to point

00:43:25.170 --> 00:43:29.270
out that the monuments that
were created after the Civil War

00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:31.730
that were put up by
white southerners to--

00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:33.030
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:34.330
&gt;&gt; Say to people--

00:43:34.330 --> 00:43:35.630
&gt;&gt; I'll cut right to it.

00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:36.930
&gt;&gt; You are, you are--

00:43:36.930 --> 00:43:38.230
&gt;&gt; What do you think
should happen to Jefferson,

00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:39.530
what do you think should
happen to Mount Vernon,

00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:40.830
what do you think should
happen to [inaudible]?

00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:42.130
&gt;&gt; Okay excuse me, those are,

00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:43.430
those are different
things because--

00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:44.730
&gt;&gt; Okay different,
that's the difference.

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:46.030
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:47.330
&gt;&gt; There's a difference.

00:43:47.330 --> 00:43:48.630
&gt;&gt; So but--

00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:49.930
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:43:49.930 --> 00:43:51.230
&gt;&gt; First of all I didn't say
monuments should all be torn

00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:52.530
down, I didn't say that.

00:43:52.530 --> 00:43:53.830
They, they could be in museums--

00:43:53.830 --> 00:43:55.130
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:56.430
&gt;&gt; First of all you had a war
fought, decide lost by the way,

00:43:56.430 --> 00:43:57.730
so what are you honoring
number one?

00:43:57.730 --> 00:44:00.920
But, but aside from any of
that, my other thing is you know

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:03.170
for you to draw lines, and
I appreciate your passion

00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:04.470
for history, I appreciate
the books

00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:06.360
that you've written the stories

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:08.150
that you tell are
very important.

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:12.120
But for you to draw lines
like you did in your videos,

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:14.930
like you're mentioning Jefferson
and the Tripoli pirates

00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:17.720
and you draw a direct
line saying Muslim nations

00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:21.540
to Isis now, the,
that is outrageous.

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:22.840
Okay.

00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:24.140
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:27.380
&gt;&gt; Okay. The other thing is, in
the, the second video as well,

00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:28.880
when you, you were
mentioning how no,

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:30.800
nobody can explain
how the battle was won

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:34.900
and so the answer is divine
intervention, that, that's,

00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:37.160
you know, that's a
little a historical also.

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:38.460
But I--

00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:39.760
&gt;&gt; Okay that's your option.

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:41.060
I want to get one
more question in.

00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:42.360
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:43.660
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:44.960
On that I said, just
to be clear,

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:48.620
the leaders of those Muslim
nations were oppressing their

00:44:48.620 --> 00:44:49.920
own people.

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:51.460
And what our ambassadors
came back and said,

00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:54.430
I love these people William
Eaton especially loved the

00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:55.730
Muslim people.

00:44:55.730 --> 00:45:00.240
He had Muslims as mercenaries
come back and take Derna

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:02.080
in two, two and a half hours.

00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:03.550
Without them they don't win.

00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:04.920
Yes sir.

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:06.740
&gt;&gt; You've written several
books with Don Yeager,

00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:09.370
how does the collaborative
process work between you two?

00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:13.020
&gt;&gt; Don deserves credit in
that, Don and I met in sports.

00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:15.060
And he said, let's do
another sports book.

00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:16.360
And I go Don I can't,

00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:18.240
for 20 years I've been
studying this spy ring,

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:21.780
and I showed all these
pages, these yellow pages.

00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:23.850
So he goes back, he
goes can I take them?

00:45:23.850 --> 00:45:26.210
I go there is no other copy.

00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:27.950
So he takes them, he comes back,

00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:30.180
it was Thanksgiving
three and a half weeks.

00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:32.820
And he said, I cannot, I
think we could do more.

00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:34.810
I go Don, we can't do
this unless we approach it

00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:36.180
like a news story.

00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:41.330
So we went out to
Fort Washington,

00:45:41.330 --> 00:45:43.910
we went out to Stoneybrook,
we went out to Penny Packard,

00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:45.550
we did the original
biography in 1930

00:45:45.550 --> 00:45:47.190
and put the spy ring together.

00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:49.890
We were able to capture that
and I was able to take a lot

00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:52.180
of this oral history and put
all the experts in the same room

00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:55.610
in a Holiday Inn in Suffice
County, and I catered it.

00:45:55.610 --> 00:45:57.760
I didn't get Subway, I
went to a regular deli.

00:45:57.760 --> 00:45:59.920
And I had all these historians.

00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:03.140
And I said, first
off, whose 355?

00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:04.580
Everyone had a different theory.

00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:08.010
Second off, Robert Townsend,
did he ever meet Washington?

00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:09.310
Where did it happen?

00:46:09.310 --> 00:46:11.030
It could have been diagonally
across from Sagamore Hill.

00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:12.330
But how do we know it?

00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:13.630
Can you point to anything?

00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:15.990
And they were able to go
through all our things.

00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:18.340
So he's the one who
pushed me to do it.

00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:22.130
But he's the one who's an
organizer, an economizer

00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:24.840
of words, I'll pump
stuff out, he'll gut it,

00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:26.450
he'll give it to
me, I'll gut it.

00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:29.760
And I don't know how people do
it, but he did it in Tallahassee

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:31.060
and I stayed in New York,

00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:33.450
and we only saw each
other three times a year.

00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:36.880
But the magic of back and forth,
back and forth, back and forth,

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:38.880
while he's doing
Namen's biography,

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:42.790
while he's doing Walter Peyton,
and all these other things.

00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:46.020
So he wanted to add sports
a little bit, I'm a sports

00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:48.290
because at Fox I can't
do sports anymore,

00:46:48.290 --> 00:46:50.130
that's why they have Fox Sports.

00:46:50.130 --> 00:46:52.250
So it was kind of a thing.

00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:54.770
I never thought I could
do if Don didn't push me.

00:46:54.770 --> 00:46:58.760
And after then, then I really
thought to myself, I could do it

00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:02.960
because if I just capture one
element and try to dominate it

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:05.610
for two years, and move forward.

00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:08.120
And I made sure that John
Meacham and Douglas Brinkley

00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:10.170
and Jay Winick, I go
guys look at it, read it.

00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:12.700
If you're not comfortable
with it, let me know.

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:15.030
And they said to me, it
works, it checks out.

00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:16.690
And they go, I'll go on
the back of the book.

00:47:16.690 --> 00:47:19.200
So that's why I felt, I
felt good about doing it.

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:21.250
But I'm still in awe
of everybody speaking

00:47:21.250 --> 00:47:23.130
in the other room and
everything like that.

00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:24.850
What I just try to
do is tell a story

00:47:24.850 --> 00:47:27.930
that hopefully will give other
people an understanding of,

00:47:27.930 --> 00:47:29.980
of America.

00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:32.280
Thank you.

00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:37.460
Thank you very much.
