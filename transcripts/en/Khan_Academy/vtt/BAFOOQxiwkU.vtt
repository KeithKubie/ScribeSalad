00:00:00.141 --> 00:00:02.061
- So I have an infinite series, here.

00:00:02.061 --> 00:00:04.861
The sum from n equals zero
to infinity of negative one

00:00:04.861 --> 00:00:07.921
to the n power times x to the sixth n

00:00:07.921 --> 00:00:11.141
over two n, the whole two n, factorial.

00:00:11.141 --> 00:00:16.141
And my goal in this video is
to evaluate this power series

00:00:17.441 --> 00:00:21.961
when x is equal to the
cubed root of pi over two.

00:00:21.961 --> 00:00:24.361
And I encourage you to pause this video

00:00:24.361 --> 00:00:26.141
and give it a go on your own.

00:00:26.141 --> 00:00:27.621
And I will give you a hint.

00:00:27.621 --> 00:00:29.841
The key to this is to figure out,

00:00:29.841 --> 00:00:32.101
well what function is
this the power series for?

00:00:32.101 --> 00:00:35.041
and then use that
function to evaluate this.

00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:37.001
And there's another clue here, hey,

00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:39.441
this is kind of a
mysterious or a suspicious

00:00:39.441 --> 00:00:41.201
looking number, here, pi over two.

00:00:41.201 --> 00:00:42.841
That looks like something I would use

00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:45.941
a trig function to evaluate.

00:00:45.941 --> 00:00:47.801
That might be a little
bit more straightforward.

00:00:47.801 --> 00:00:50.201
So I'll let you have a go at it.

00:00:51.078 --> 00:00:52.582
So I'm assuming you have tried,

00:00:52.582 --> 00:00:54.202
so let's try to work
through this together.

00:00:54.202 --> 00:00:56.642
And in any of these types of problems

00:00:56.642 --> 00:01:00.202
I like to at least expand
out this power series

00:01:00.202 --> 00:01:02.443
so I get a better sense of what it's like.

00:01:02.828 --> 00:01:04.643
So this right over here,
if I were to expand it out,

00:01:04.643 --> 00:01:06.763
this is going to be
equal to when n is zero,

00:01:06.763 --> 00:01:09.803
this is one, actually,
all of these are one,

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:11.043
so it's just going to be one.

00:01:11.043 --> 00:01:12.983
When n is one, this is going to be

00:01:12.983 --> 00:01:15.123
negative one, x to the sixth,

00:01:15.123 --> 00:01:18.143
x to the sixth over two factorial.

00:01:18.143 --> 00:01:21.363
when n is two, it's going to be positive.

00:01:21.363 --> 00:01:23.223
negative one squared is positive one,

00:01:23.223 --> 00:01:28.023
times x to the 12th over four factorial.

00:01:28.023 --> 00:01:30.963
and then let's just do one
more: when x is equal to three,

00:01:30.963 --> 00:01:34.364
it's going to be negative x to the 18th.

00:01:35.054 --> 00:01:39.567
x to the 18th over six factorial.

00:01:39.567 --> 00:01:41.367
And you just keep going on and on forever.

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:45.187
Now, offhand, I don't know a function,

00:01:45.187 --> 00:01:46.707
especially a trigonometric function,

00:01:46.707 --> 00:01:48.187
because that was kind of our clue here,

00:01:48.187 --> 00:01:50.227
this pi over two makes me feel like

00:01:50.227 --> 00:01:53.667
this might be a trigonometric
function right over here

00:01:53.667 --> 00:01:55.847
Nothing jumps out at me offhand,

00:01:55.847 --> 00:01:59.747
but this does look suspiciously familiar.

00:01:59.747 --> 00:02:03.567
This looks awfully close
to the power series,

00:02:03.567 --> 00:02:05.927
or the Maclaurin Series for cosine of x.

00:02:05.927 --> 00:02:08.347
Which we have seen multiple times.

00:02:08.347 --> 00:02:10.387
Let's just remind
ourselves of what that is.

00:02:10.387 --> 00:02:11.607
And if this doesn't look familiar,

00:02:11.607 --> 00:02:14.447
the previous video where
I do the Maclaurin Series

00:02:14.447 --> 00:02:17.367
for cosine of x goes into
detail on how I get this.

00:02:17.367 --> 00:02:22.367
The Maclaurin Series for
cosine of x is equal to...

00:02:22.667 --> 00:02:23.627
So I'll just write a few terms,

00:02:23.627 --> 00:02:25.147
so I'll write approximately equal to

00:02:25.147 --> 00:02:29.567
one minus x squared over two factorial,

00:02:29.567 --> 00:02:34.567
plus x to the fourth over four factorial,

00:02:36.027 --> 00:02:40.847
minus x to the sixth over six factorial,

00:02:40.847 --> 00:02:43.527
and just like that you're
probably seeing the similarities.

00:02:43.527 --> 00:02:45.447
Well the first term is the same,

00:02:45.447 --> 00:02:47.447
the sign negative, positive,
negative, positive,

00:02:47.447 --> 00:02:49.127
negative, positive, negative, positive.

00:02:49.127 --> 00:02:51.887
two factorial, four
factorial, six factorial.

00:02:51.887 --> 00:02:54.667
The difference is the powers,

00:02:54.667 --> 00:02:56.387
the exponents on the x.

00:02:56.387 --> 00:02:58.327
This is x squared, this is x to the sixth.

00:02:58.327 --> 00:03:00.667
This is x to the fourth,
that's x to the 12th.

00:03:00.667 --> 00:03:03.847
This is x to the sixth,
that's x to the 18th.

00:03:05.154 --> 00:03:06.804
Well, what if we...

00:03:06.804 --> 00:03:09.328
I guess, something for
you to think about is,

00:03:09.328 --> 00:03:12.888
well, how can we replace
x with something here?

00:03:12.888 --> 00:03:14.028
Because anything that I change,

00:03:14.028 --> 00:03:15.568
if I take cosine of...

00:03:15.568 --> 00:03:18.028
if I change x to, I don't know, a plus b,

00:03:18.028 --> 00:03:20.308
everywhere we see an x, you'd
replace it with an a plus b.

00:03:20.308 --> 00:03:23.048
Can we put a power of x here,

00:03:23.048 --> 00:03:26.321
so that these things end up like that?

00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:30.742
well, this x to the
sixth is the same thing,

00:03:32.371 --> 00:03:35.892
as x to the third squared.

00:03:35.892 --> 00:03:37.852
That's x to the third squared.

00:03:37.852 --> 00:03:39.672
This right over here, x to the 12th,

00:03:39.672 --> 00:03:42.552
is the same thing as x to the
third to the fourth power.

00:03:42.552 --> 00:03:45.092
This right over here is the same thing as

00:03:45.092 --> 00:03:47.572
x to the third to the sixth power.

00:03:47.572 --> 00:03:51.292
So if we could replace each of
these xs with x to the thirds

00:03:51.292 --> 00:03:54.372
we will get this power series up here.

00:03:54.372 --> 00:03:55.292
Well, how do we do that?

00:03:55.292 --> 00:03:58.052
Well, we would just say the
cosine of x to the third

00:03:58.052 --> 00:04:00.021
and actually let me do
that in a different color.

00:04:01.052 --> 00:04:03.352
So the cosine, and that's
not a different color.

00:04:04.521 --> 00:04:09.072
So the cosine of x to the
third is going to be equal to,

00:04:09.963 --> 00:04:11.399
and once again, everywhere we see an x,

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:12.536
we replace it with x to the third.

00:04:12.536 --> 00:04:14.936
So it's one minus, and actually,

00:04:14.936 --> 00:04:17.497
I'm just going to put in
parenthesis squared, two factorial.

00:04:17.497 --> 00:04:19.539
I wanted to do that in the green,

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:21.572
let me do all this in the green.

00:04:21.572 --> 00:04:23.437
Alright, so it's gonna be equal to:

00:04:23.437 --> 00:04:27.617
one minus parenthesis
squared over two factorial

00:04:27.617 --> 00:04:31.917
plus parenthesis to the fourth
power over four factorial.

00:04:31.917 --> 00:04:36.777
minus parenthesis to the
sixth power over 6 factorial.

00:04:36.777 --> 00:04:39.697
And now let me change
back to that mauve color.

00:04:39.697 --> 00:04:42.117
And since I'm taking the
cosine of x to the third,

00:04:42.117 --> 00:04:44.537
well this is gonna be
x to the third squared.

00:04:44.537 --> 00:04:47.157
this is gonna be x to the
third to the fourth power.

00:04:47.157 --> 00:04:49.197
this is gonna be x to the
third to the sixth power.

00:04:49.197 --> 00:04:52.577
Which is exactly what
I have right over here.

00:04:52.577 --> 00:04:55.477
So this right over here
is the power series

00:04:55.477 --> 00:04:57.777
for cosine of x to the third.

00:04:57.777 --> 00:05:00.957
So evaluating this when x is equal to

00:05:00.957 --> 00:05:02.517
the cubed root of pi over two,

00:05:02.517 --> 00:05:04.477
is the same thing as evaluating this

00:05:04.477 --> 00:05:06.857
when x is equal to the
cubed root of pi over two.

00:05:06.857 --> 00:05:08.798
Let me write that down,
because this is interesting.

00:05:08.798 --> 00:05:13.798
So this, so I'll just rewrite
it, from n equals zero

00:05:14.861 --> 00:05:18.360
to infinity of negative one to the n

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.360
of x to the sixth n over two n factorial.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.120
This is equal to, this is the
power series representation,

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.160
of cosine of x to the third power.

00:05:33.144 --> 00:05:34.160
So if you want to evaluate this

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.680
when x is the cubed root of pi over two,

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.720
we just have to evaluate this

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.240
when x is the cubed root of pi over two.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.943
And this does suspiciously
work out nicely,

00:05:40.943 --> 00:05:42.903
because if you take the
cube of the cubed root,

00:05:42.903 --> 00:05:44.403
well, good things happen.

00:05:44.403 --> 00:05:49.403
So the cosine of the
cubed root of pi over two

00:05:53.467 --> 00:05:55.663
to the third power, well
that's just the same thing

00:05:55.663 --> 00:05:58.063
as cosine of pi over two,

00:05:58.063 --> 00:06:03.063
which, of course, is equal to zero.

00:06:03.843 --> 00:06:07.843
And we are done.
