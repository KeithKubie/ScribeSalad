amount more than I'd like to but if I'd

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510
amount more than I'd like to but if I'd
 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.240
amount more than I'd like to but if I'd
only been to six places on the surface

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250
only been to six places on the surface
 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.410
only been to six places on the surface
of the earth I wouldn't know much about

west and didn't know about the Grand
 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.260
west and didn't know about the Grand
Canyon it'd be kind of a different story

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270
Canyon it'd be kind of a different story
 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.090
Canyon it'd be kind of a different story
in terms of where I might choose to go

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100
in terms of where I might choose to go
 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.219
in terms of where I might choose to go
but what if the rocks in the Grand

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229
but what if the rocks in the Grand
 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.230
but what if the rocks in the Grand
Canyon weren't of interest and the ones

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240
Canyon weren't of interest and the ones
 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.820
Canyon weren't of interest and the ones
in Letchworth State Park even though

in Letchworth State Park even though
 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.279
in Letchworth State Park even though
it's smaller were so what you really

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:17.289
it's smaller were so what you really

need when you're looking at landing
 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:20.910
need when you're looking at landing
sites is not only do you have to know

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920
sites is not only do you have to know
 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.130
sites is not only do you have to know
something about the planet and where the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140
something about the planet and where the
 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.469
something about the planet and where the
good places are but you've got to bring

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479
good places are but you've got to bring
 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.419
good places are but you've got to bring
together the expertise to be able to

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:27.429
together the expertise to be able to
 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:29.730
together the expertise to be able to
look at those places and find out which

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740
look at those places and find out which
 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.590
look at those places and find out which
ones are the most relevant for the kinds

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600
ones are the most relevant for the kinds
 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.330
ones are the most relevant for the kinds
of things that you want to accomplish

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340
of things that you want to accomplish
 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.609
of things that you want to accomplish
with your mission so we started with

with your mission so we started with
 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.160
with your mission so we started with
about 65 landing site candidates from

what we found attractive about those
 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:54.899
what we found attractive about those
four places and I'll point out that the

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909
four places and I'll point out that the
 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:56.609
four places and I'll point out that the

about these two on the bottom where they
 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.840
about these two on the bottom where they
occur relatively late in Mars history

compared to when we think it was the
 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.520
compared to when we think it was the
wettest and if we got there we're seeing

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530
wettest and if we got there we're seeing
 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.590
wettest and if we got there we're seeing
a fairly narrow period in the history of

a fairly narrow period in the history of
 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.050
a fairly narrow period in the history of
Mars so we want to know relative to

we might want to sample a place where

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020
we might want to sample a place where

the section that's preserved is much
 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.700
the section that's preserved is much
older and that brings us to Gale up here

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710
