00:00:00.807 --> 00:00:02.830
Voiceover:So, we've got
three functions graphed here.

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:04.452
The function f in magenta.

00:00:04.452 --> 00:00:07.358
We have the function
g in this green color.

00:00:07.358 --> 00:00:11.080
And we have the function h
in this dotted purple color.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.460
And then we have three
potential expressions,

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.529
or three expressions that could be

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:17.362
potential definitions, for f, g, and h.

00:00:17.362 --> 00:00:19.354
And what I want to do in this
video, is try to match them,

00:00:19.354 --> 00:00:22.863
try to match the function to a definition.

00:00:22.863 --> 00:00:25.795
I encourage you to pause this video

00:00:25.795 --> 00:00:26.997
and try to think about it on your own

00:00:26.997 --> 00:00:29.247
before I work through it.

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:32.737
There's a couple of ways
that we could approach this.

00:00:32.737 --> 00:00:34.391
One, we could think about what the graphs

00:00:34.391 --> 00:00:36.229
of each of these look like,
and then think about which

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:38.790
of these function's graphs look like that.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.197
Or, we could we could
look at the function graph

00:00:40.197 --> 00:00:42.830
and think about the vertical
and horizontal asymptotes,

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.279
and think about which of
these expressions would have

00:00:44.279 --> 00:00:47.529
a vertical or horizontal
asymptotes at that point.

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:48.811
So, I'm actually going
to do it the second way.

00:00:48.811 --> 00:00:50.496
Let's look at the graphs.

00:00:50.496 --> 00:00:52.311
I tend to be a little bit more visual,

00:00:52.311 --> 00:00:53.947
or I like to look at graphs.

00:00:53.947 --> 00:00:56.080
So it looks like - f, I'll start with f.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.860
f looks like it has a vertical
asymptote at x equals 5.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.294
Or, sorry, at x equals negative 5.

00:01:03.294 --> 00:01:05.461
We have a vertical
asymptote right over here,

00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:09.244
at x is equal to negative five.

00:01:09.244 --> 00:01:10.511
Let's think about which of these

00:01:10.511 --> 00:01:12.610
would have a vertical asymptote
at x equals negative 5.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.344
In order to have a vertical asymptote,

00:01:14.344 --> 00:01:16.636
it can't be defined there.

00:01:16.636 --> 00:01:18.161
So that'sthe first way
I would think about it.

00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:19.442
And then even if isn't defined there,

00:01:19.442 --> 00:01:22.523
we need to make sure that it's
an actual vertical asymptote,

00:01:22.523 --> 00:01:24.624
and not just a hole at that point,

00:01:24.624 --> 00:01:26.539
not just a point discontinuity.

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:28.825
So, let's think about it.

00:01:28.825 --> 00:01:30.948
So, this first expression
is actually defined

00:01:30.948 --> 00:01:32.098
at x equals negative 5.

00:01:32.098 --> 00:01:33.965
The only reason why it
wouldn't be defined,

00:01:33.965 --> 00:01:35.781
if somehow we got a 0 in the denominator.

00:01:35.781 --> 00:01:37.195
But if you have negative 5 minus 5,

00:01:37.195 --> 00:01:38.244
that's negative 10.

00:01:38.244 --> 00:01:40.548
So this one's defined at
that point, so that's not f.

00:01:40.548 --> 00:01:42.937
This one's also defined
at x equals negative 5.

00:01:42.937 --> 00:01:45.753
The denominator does not
become 0, so that's not f.

00:01:45.753 --> 00:01:48.186
This one, when x is equal to negative 5,

00:01:48.186 --> 00:01:50.753
this denominator does become 0.

00:01:50.753 --> 00:01:54.007
So this seems, I just used
purely deductive reasoning,

00:01:54.007 --> 00:01:57.840
this looks like my best
candidate for f of x.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.122
But let's confirm that it's consistent

00:01:59.122 --> 00:02:02.023
with the other things that
we're seeing over here.

00:02:02.023 --> 00:02:05.561
So, let's look at f's
horizontal asymptote.

00:02:05.561 --> 00:02:06.425
If I look at the graph,

00:02:06.425 --> 00:02:08.211
it looks like there's
a horizontal asymptote.

00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:10.978
Especially as x gets to
larger and larger values,

00:02:10.978 --> 00:02:13.679
it looks like f of x is approaching 1.

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:16.272
f of x is approaching 1.

00:02:16.272 --> 00:02:19.311
Now, is that the same case over here?

00:02:19.311 --> 00:02:22.077
As x gets larger and larger and larger,

00:02:22.077 --> 00:02:24.246
as x approaches infinity,

00:02:24.246 --> 00:02:26.545
well, then the negative 2
and the plus 5 don't matter.

00:02:26.545 --> 00:02:29.250
As x approaches infinity,
this is going to approximate,

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.500
for very large x's, it's
going to be x over x.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.700
We look at the highest degree terms,

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.583
and so that is going to approach 1,

00:02:36.583 --> 00:02:38.323
as x gets very very very large.

00:02:38.323 --> 00:02:41.066
Then the negative two,
subtracting the 2 in the numerator

00:02:41.066 --> 00:02:42.250
and adding 5 in the denominator

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.466
are going to matter
less and less and less,

00:02:43.466 --> 00:02:45.368
because the x gets so big.

00:02:45.368 --> 00:02:46.634
So, this will approach 1.

00:02:46.634 --> 00:02:48.867
So, that seems consistent
from that point of view.

00:02:48.867 --> 00:02:51.283
And let's see, is there
anything else interesting?

00:02:51.283 --> 00:02:53.033
Well, when does this equal 0?

00:02:53.033 --> 00:02:56.214
Well, the numerator equals
0 when x is equal to 2.

00:02:56.214 --> 00:02:58.932
And we see that's indeed the
case for f right over there.

00:02:58.932 --> 00:03:02.200
So, I'm feeling really good
that this is our f of x.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.518
Now, let's look at g of x.

00:03:04.518 --> 00:03:07.885
g of x has, and actually they're
trying to trip us up here,

00:03:07.885 --> 00:03:10.900
because it looks like both h and g of x,

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.067
have a vertical asymptote
at x is equal to 5.

00:03:16.067 --> 00:03:17.384
So the vertical asymptote isn't

00:03:17.384 --> 00:03:21.768
what's going to help us
resolve between g and h.

00:03:21.768 --> 00:03:23.268
Did I just say g and f?

00:03:23.268 --> 00:03:27.386
g and h both have a vertical
asymptote at x equals 5.

00:03:27.386 --> 00:03:28.502
And you see that over here.

00:03:28.502 --> 00:03:32.302
At x equals 5, both of them are undefined.

00:03:32.302 --> 00:03:35.317
When x equals 5, both of
their denominators are 0.

00:03:35.317 --> 00:03:39.233
So, let's see if the horizontal
asymptotes could help us.

00:03:39.233 --> 00:03:41.751
So, it looks like g has
a horizontal asymptote

00:03:41.751 --> 00:03:44.802
at y equals negative 2.

00:03:44.802 --> 00:03:46.667
y equals negative 2.

00:03:46.667 --> 00:03:49.385
if x becomes very
positive or very negative,

00:03:49.385 --> 00:03:52.018
it looks like y is approaching negative 2.

00:03:52.018 --> 00:03:55.384
So, what's happening up
here, for this top one?

00:03:55.384 --> 00:03:57.718
Well, if we expand out the numerator,

00:03:57.718 --> 00:04:03.917
this is equal to 2 x
minus 12, over x minus 5.

00:04:03.917 --> 00:04:07.733
For very large x's the negative 12

00:04:07.733 --> 00:04:09.680
and the negative 5 aren't
going to matter as much.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.864
So this is, for very very large x's,

00:04:12.864 --> 00:04:16.553
this is going to be
approximately 2 x over x.

00:04:16.553 --> 00:04:17.743
Let me make it very clear,

00:04:17.743 --> 00:04:24.621
for, maybe I'll write, "as
x approaches infinity."

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.311
And 2 x over x would be 2,

00:04:27.311 --> 00:04:30.844
would be approximately equal
to 2 as x approaches infinity.

00:04:30.844 --> 00:04:33.898
g's asymptote isn't at
2, it's at negative 2.

00:04:33.898 --> 00:04:39.709
h's asymptote's the one
that looks like it's at 2.

00:04:39.709 --> 00:04:41.247
At y equals 2.

00:04:41.247 --> 00:04:44.826
So this top one looks like h of x.

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:47.255
This top one looks like at h of x.

00:04:47.255 --> 00:04:48.310
And we can confirm that.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.913
When would h of x equal 0?

00:04:49.913 --> 00:04:52.389
Well, the numerator
equals 0 when x equals 6,

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:54.440
and we see it right over here.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.888
Now, that might not
have helped us that much

00:04:55.888 --> 00:04:59.922
because g also equals 0 at six,

00:04:59.922 --> 00:05:02.108
but at least the horizontal asymptotes

00:05:02.108 --> 00:05:04.777
is what is cluing us in.

00:05:04.777 --> 00:05:06.897
As x gets really really really large,

00:05:06.897 --> 00:05:09.160
then the negative, subtracting
the 12 in the numerator,

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.462
subtracting the 5 in the denominator,

00:05:10.462 --> 00:05:11.760
are going to matter
less and less and less.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.661
We want to look at the
highest degree terms.

00:05:13.661 --> 00:05:16.044
It's going to approach
2 x over x, which is 2.

00:05:16.044 --> 00:05:17.747
And we see that for h.

00:05:17.747 --> 00:05:21.676
Now, g, if we just use
our deductive reasoning,

00:05:21.676 --> 00:05:23.798
we'd say "okay, well,
hopefully this is our g of x."

00:05:23.798 --> 00:05:24.848
Now does this make sense?

00:05:24.848 --> 00:05:30.110
g of x is equal to 12
minus 2 x, over x minus 5.

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.135
Which is approximately
going to be equal to,

00:05:33.135 --> 00:05:34.827
we look at the highest degree terms,

00:05:34.827 --> 00:05:39.549
negative 2 x over x,

00:05:39.549 --> 00:05:43.593
as x approaches infinity.

00:05:43.593 --> 00:05:46.010
Which is going to be equal to,

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.053
or we're going to approach negative 2.

00:05:48.053 --> 00:05:50.952
And that is indeed where
g's horizontal asymptote is.

00:05:50.952 --> 00:05:53.772
As x gets very very large,
we approach negative 2,

00:05:53.772 --> 00:05:55.989
or frankly as x gets very very small,

00:05:55.989 --> 00:05:57.634
we're also going to approach negative 2.

00:05:57.634 --> 00:05:59.079
Negative 2 times the negative billion

00:05:59.079 --> 00:06:01.778
over a negative billion is
also going to be negative 2.

00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:05.331
So, we can feel pretty good
that this is our g of x.
