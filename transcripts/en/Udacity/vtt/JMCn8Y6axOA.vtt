Now that we finally have values for w and
n to equal, we can plug them into our

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:09.471
equation for total future earnings, using
substitution, like we have so many times

00:00:09.483 --> 00:00:14.783
before. Can you use these two numbers, 30
and 12, in the proper places in this

00:00:14.783 --> 00:00:20.127
equation to come up with a number for the
total amount of money that Grant will make

00:00:20.127 --> 00:00:23.205
off of the orders that have come in so
far? Think about what numbers you want to

00:00:23.217 --> 00:00:26.763
substitute where, and then be sure to be
careful about order of operations.
