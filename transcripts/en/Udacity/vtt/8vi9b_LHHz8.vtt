00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:06.350
In the boxes below, input what D3 function or web technology

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.060
transforms data from one stage of the Grammar of Graphics pipeline to the next.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.760
For example, in the first box, what D3 function or

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.940
web technology transforms a source data file into variables?

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.640
And the dot, dot, dot here represents the middle of the chain, which for

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.850
sake of simplicity I omitted.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:33.260
But the second box represents the transformation from coordinates to aesthetics.
