00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.920
We're on problem 138.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.540
At a loading dock, each worker
on the night crew loaded 3/4

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.970
as many boxes as each worker
on the day crew.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.450
So that means that the boxes per
night crew worker is equal

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.850
to 3/4 the number of boxes
per day crew worker.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:32.150
If the night crew has 4/5 as
many workers as the day crew--

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.140
the number of night crew workers
is going to be 4/5

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.960
times the number of
day crew workers.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.370
What fraction of all the boxes
loaded by the two crews did

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.090
the day crew load?

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.540
So, how many boxes will
the day crew load?

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.710
The day crew is going to load
the number of day crew workers

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.480
times the boxes per
day crew worker.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.780
And they want to know what
fraction of all of the boxes

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.650
loaded is this?

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.900
So that'll be the numerator,
and the denominator will be

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:02.870
all the boxes loaded.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.500
So all the boxes loaded are
going to be the boxes loaded

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.860
by the day crew.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.330
So that's the number of workers
times the boxes per

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.370
worker, plus the number
of boxes loaded

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.550
by the night crew.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.310
That's going to be the number
of night crew workers times

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.440
the number of boxes per
night crew worker.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.880
And to simplify this, if we
could just substitute these

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.310
variables with things that look
a lot more like that.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.570
And lo and behold, we have easy
substitutions to tell us

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.520
what b sub n is, the boxes
per night crew worker.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.970
And they tell us what the number
of night crew workers

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.530
are in terms of the
day crew workers.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:39.380
So let's just substitute.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.360
So this is equal to day crew
workers times boxes per day

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.440
crew worker, divided by day crew
workers times boxes per

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.120
day crew workers, plus,
what is the number

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.940
of night crew workers?

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.330
It's w sub n, but that's the
same thing as 4/5 w sub d.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.360
And then what are the
number of boxes

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.430
per night crew worker?

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.200
That's 3/4 times the boxes
per day crew worker.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.510
The 4's cancel out.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.220
Actually, we could
simplify this.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.670
We can divide the top and the
bottom by this w sub d times b

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:32.235
sub d, and you get 1 over 1
plus-- all of these cancel and

00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:33.485
you're just left with 3/5.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:44.100
That's equal to 1 over 8/5,
which is equal to 5/8.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.610
And that is choice E.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:55.840
Next problem, 139.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:04.320
A restaurant meal costs $35.50
and there is no tax.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:14.520
If the tip was more than 10% but
less than 15% of the cost

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.656
of the meal, then the total
amount must have been-- So

00:03:17.656 --> 00:03:18.740
what's the range for the tip?

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.440
10% of $35.50.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.770
That's just going to be $3.55.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.130
And 15%-- there's a couple ways
you can think about it.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.320
You could say it's half
more than this.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.250
What's half of this?

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:42.970
Half of this is $1.77 1/2.

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.180
I think that's right.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.300
soon.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.060
Really, you can't
get a half-cent.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.510
Is that right?

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.300
2 times that, you get 2.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.830
And 2 times 70 is $1.40.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:58.960
So this would be 5%.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.030
I just took half of this That's
how people do it.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.700
Half of 10%.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.556
If where you live, the tax
is 10%, but I don't

00:04:06.556 --> 00:04:07.500
want to get into that.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:19.779
So if you add this to this, you
get 4, 5, 12, 13, and 5.

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:27.500
So the tip is going to be
between $3.55 and $5.33, I

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.380
guess we could say.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.450
And so the total bill, that's
what they want to know, we

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:33.450
just add both of these.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.920
So at minimum, you're going to
pay what's this plus $35?

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:44.050
So $35.50 and $3.55.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.610
5, 10, 9.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.760
$39.05.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.110
And at the high end,
you have $35.50.

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.270
And then you have $5.33.

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:07.850
And that is equal to
3, 8, 0, 1, 4.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:13.760
So your total bill is going
to be between $39 and $41.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.740
And that is exactly choice B.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:17.310
They just round up.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.900
They say $41 is here
and $39 is here.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.610
If it's between these 2 numbers,
it's definitely

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.350
between $39 and $41.

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:24.600
And that's choice B.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.510
Problem 140.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.880
In a weightlifting competition,
the total weight

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.070
of Joe's two lifts was 750.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:46.380
So l1, his first lift plus the
second lift was 750 pounds.

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:56.005
If twice the weight of the
first lift was 300-- If 2

00:05:56.005 --> 00:06:00.180
times the first lift was equal
to 300 more than the weight of

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:09.340
his second lift, what was
the weight in pounds

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.080
of his first lift?

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.720
So we just want to
solve for l1.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.720
So this top equation we can
rewrite as l2 is equal

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.080
to 750 minus l1.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.390
Then we can substitute
that here.

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:31.600
So then you get 2 times l1 is
equal to 300 plus l2, which is

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.190
this, plus 750 minus l1.

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:37.680
Add l1 to both sides.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.220
You get 3 l1 is equal
to 300 plus 750.

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.890
That's 1,050.

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:52.070
And 3 goes into 1,050-- 3 times
3 is 9, 15, 3 goes into

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:55.430
15 5 times, so it's 350.

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.930
So his first lift
was 350 pounds.

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.380
And that's choice D.

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:09.820
Problem 141.

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:14.740
A club collected exactly
$599 from its members.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:18.400
If each member contributed
at least $12, what is the

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.630
greatest number of members
the club could have?

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:30.180
So the more that each member
contributed, the smaller you

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.110
the number of people
in the club.

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:36.400
If each member contributed at
least $12-- so what is the

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.190
greatest number of members
the club could have?

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:47.690
So if they all contributed
exactly $12-- 12

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:57.690
goes into 600 50 times.

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:08.830
So if this number were $600,
you could say if $600 were

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:13.240
collected in increments of at
least $12, then you could have

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:18.860
at most 50 people.

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.840
But we don't have $600.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.960
$600 would be 50 times 12.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:27.762
We have $599.

00:08:27.762 --> 00:08:32.679
$599 can be done by at
most not 50 people,

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:36.860
but at most 49 people.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:37.570
Let's think about it.

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:39.360
Let's make sure that
that's right.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:43.510
So my answer is 49,
which is C.

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:46.060
And let's think about how much
money would be left over, so

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:47.940
49 times 12.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.220
This is just a reality check.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.910
49 times 12.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:53.050
2 times 9 is 18.

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:56.410
2 times 4 is 8 plus 1 is 9.

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:58.830
0, 49.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:05.820
8, 18, 588.

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:09.670
So if you have 49 people, and
they all contribute $12

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:15.050
exactly, you'll raise $588.

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:17.470
And then you could have had a
couple of other people, you

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:20.480
could have had 11 other
people who instead of

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.970
$12, they paid $13.

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:24.260
And that's how you get
to $599, because they

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:25.520
say at least $12.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:29.410
You can't have 50 people,
because 50 people, if they

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:30.910
contribute at least $12,
you would have to

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:33.010
raise at least $600.

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:35.000
So it can't be 50, so
the answer is 49.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.490
And you might say why did you
go immediately to $600?

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:40.320
And a lot of times on the GMAT,
where they have these

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.480
numbers that are 12 and 599--
those are strange numbers.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:46.190
You say 599 is awfully
close to 600.

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:48.650
Let's see if I can use that
information to deduce

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:51.010
something interesting
about this problem.

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:58.290
Anyway, next problem, 142.

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:03.660
Of the 3,600 employees of
Company x, 1/3 are clerical.

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:08.540
So clerical is equal
to 1/3 times 3,600,

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:11.200
which is equal to 1,200.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.890
If the clerical staff were to
be reduced by 1/3, what

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:18.690
percentage of the total number
of remaining employees would

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:20.560
then be clerical?

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.030
We're going to reduce the
clerical staff by 1/3, so how

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:24.920
many people are we going
to get rid of?

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.590
So 1/3 of 1,200 is what?

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:29.280
It's 400.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:36.450
So the clerical staff is now
going to be 1,200 minus 1/3,

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:39.340
minus 400, which is
equal to 800.

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:42.960
So what proportion is this of
the remaining employees?

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.770
So clerical is 800, and
how many remaining

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:46.970
employees are there?

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:48.960
Are there 3,600?

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:52.440
No, we've gotten rid of 400
employees who were clerical.

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:55.850
So now we have 3,200
employees.

00:10:55.850 --> 00:11:01.140
3,600 minus 400, so that
is equal to 1/4.

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:07.700
And that's A, 25%.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:11.590
Problem 143.

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:12.510
Actually, I'm out of time.

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:13.740
I'll continue this in
the next video.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:14.990
