00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.080
 For this main video 

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.380
 It is worth saying from the outset 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.380
 The actual objective is clear 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.380
 Is to achieve happiness 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.380
 And not misery 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.560
 But you look like me 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.560
 You may find advice on happiness 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.080
 It is kind of problematic 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.420
 Almost annoying 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.480
 So it may be helpful to think 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.660
 On how to achieve the opposite 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.820
 Thus, to see how that procedure has been 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.660
 Take action against us 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.660
 Happiness is the subject that is 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.360
 Extraordinarily appropriate for this mental reflection 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.500
 Dear viewers 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.180
 Do not take the main video as craft advice 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.820
 I want each of you to find his own happiness 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.820
 That's why I made this video 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:37.700
 Good luck 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.400
 Why are you still here?
