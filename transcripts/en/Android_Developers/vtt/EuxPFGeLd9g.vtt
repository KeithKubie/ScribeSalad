00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.166
woman: A good rating is vital
to your app's success.

00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:10.966
Users are more likely to
download a well-rated app.

00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:14.000
We've compiled ten key tips
to increase your app's rating.

00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.866
Read and understand Android's
creative vision

00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.533
on the Android Developer's
website.

00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:23.700
By embodying the principles
in your app,

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.433
you will enchant the user,

00:00:25.433 --> 00:00:27.266
simplify their life,

00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:29.033
and make them amazing.

00:00:29.033 --> 00:00:30.633
Make your design your own.

00:00:30.633 --> 00:00:33.066
Great design comes from
understanding your users

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.300
but still pushing
the boundaries.

00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:40.366
Material Design
is a design ethos

00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:41.966
for a multi-screen world.

00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:43.733
It provides
a comprehensive guide

00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:46.433
for visual, motion,
and interaction design

00:00:46.433 --> 00:00:48.800
across all form factors
and devices.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.233
Get started at
Google/com/design.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.633
A great smartphone app
doesn't necessarily equal

00:00:57.633 --> 00:00:59.966
a great tablet or Wear
or TV app.

00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:02.433
Don't copy your app
to other form factors.

00:01:02.433 --> 00:01:04.466
Adapt it to each use case.

00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:07.133
A tablet user will immerse
themselves in your app,

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:09.633
so make use of that
extra screen space.

00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:11.933
Your Wear user will want
timely information.

00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:15.633
Focus on specific actions that
would be useful then and there.

00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:22.300
Elegant, usable, high-rated apps
are most often simple too.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.000
Look critically at your menus
and action buttons

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.033
and focus on what your user
will really want

00:01:27.033 --> 00:01:28.566
and really need to do.

00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:34.033
The quality guidelines
will provide you

00:01:34.033 --> 00:01:36.400
with a minimum starting point
for your app testing.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.433
By exercising these tests
for each form factor

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:42.066
your app supports, you can
ensure your app hits

00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:44.466
the essential requirements
every great Android app

00:01:44.466 --> 00:01:45.466
is built on.

00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:52.200
You should test your app on as
many real devices as possible.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.666
The Google Cloud Test Lab

00:01:53.666 --> 00:01:56.233
can help with the devices
you can't get your hands on.

00:01:56.233 --> 00:01:58.266
Sign up in the Developer Console

00:01:58.266 --> 00:02:01.133
to receive test reports
for your alpha and beta apps.

00:02:01.133 --> 00:02:03.066
These reports will help you
understand

00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:04.766
the results of loading
and interacting

00:02:04.766 --> 00:02:07.333
with your app on popular
physical devices

00:02:07.333 --> 00:02:09.066
from different geographies.

00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:15.066
Source your testers,

00:02:15.066 --> 00:02:16.833
key members of your
user community,

00:02:16.833 --> 00:02:18.366
those who are keen to feedback.

00:02:18.366 --> 00:02:20.333
Then use the beta testing
feature

00:02:20.333 --> 00:02:21.666
of your Developer Console

00:02:21.666 --> 00:02:23.433
to distribute your test app

00:02:23.433 --> 00:02:25.966
so that you can start gathering
their feedback.

00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:32.433
Asking users to sign in too soon
can be a turn-off.

00:02:32.433 --> 00:02:35.400
Let them appreciate what your
app has to offer first.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.633
Have them sign in
when it makes sense,

00:02:37.633 --> 00:02:40.200
such as for saving content,
personalization,

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.666
cross-device functionality,
and more.

00:02:45.433 --> 00:02:48.366
The Developer Console lets you
read users' reviews

00:02:48.366 --> 00:02:49.766
and reply to them too.

00:02:49.766 --> 00:02:52.100
The reviews can help you
understand the top problems

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.900
that users have with your app.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.166
Respond, acknowledge, fix.

00:02:56.166 --> 00:02:59.000
Let them know if the fix won't
be an instant update.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.600
Earn a loyal following.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.466
Your app ratings will reflect
this mutual respect.

00:03:06.833 --> 00:03:09.166
Keep an eye on reasons
for crashes or freezes

00:03:09.166 --> 00:03:12.000
with the information provided
in the Developer Console.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.233
Monitor this information closely

00:03:14.233 --> 00:03:17.000
and fix any issues as quickly
as possible.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.466
A high app rating and great
reviews will pay dividends,

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:23.866
encouraging others to download
and engage with your app.

00:03:23.866 --> 00:03:26.200
