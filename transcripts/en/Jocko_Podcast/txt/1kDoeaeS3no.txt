Speaker 1:          01:17          Glenn. I'm like online heart. I think they did it. I think you'll like they fought. Anyway. That's a whole nother thing. Anyway, we spent two years working at an awful job where I lead from the middle and improve the output of the entire facility while adding to my own skillset to the point where I was able to get a job, get a job. I love.

Speaker 2:          01:36          That's awesome. That's awesome to be bragging about the fact that you had an awful job that you just got after it and, and look what happened. Guess what the results are. You get the job that you wanted.

Speaker 1:          01:49          Shelby love. Yup. Started at the new job last Wednesday, so that just happened. Boom. Legit NC started taking class for the next job. I want on a Coursera must be some kind of an internet thing. Um, I'm halfway through the data science certification program. Yeah. Settings. I'm currently 26 and I fully intend to get after it until the day I die of past your lessons onto my younger brother who has lost 50 pounds and swings the Kettlebell. I got him everyday. Dang. When I lacked the motivation to do what needs to be done, your words ring the loud in my ears. Discipline equals freedom. Thank you so much. Okay, so the, my quit. The question is, um, you may not,

Speaker 2:          02:35          the reason I included this preamble of kind of what he's been, you're going to hear, but as I thought about how to answer this question, I, it's good to know what the background is and what successes he's had. That's where we kind of threw that in there cause it's, and, and it's awesome. It's awesome to hear about a trooper just getting after it. Dang numbers too. That's the thing. Yeah. That's the good thing about like, you know, somebody you can say, Hey, I'm getting after it nowadays. Good, good. But if I'm dead lifting four 55, this guy's like kind of finding after it, here's how, here's how my my results. Awesome. Um, Kay Jocko, you may not have this issue. How do you avoid feeling discouraged when you realize how much of your life you wasted when you're not getting after it? Do you ever worry that you won't achieve your full potential because you wasted time?

Speaker 2:          03:25          Well, first of all, like I said, first and foremost, congratulations second. That's just legit. And to have made that much progress, you're obviously on the path and getting after it and what you've accomplished is awesome. Some people never make that transition, so stay on and keep crushing it. Now, as far as discouragement goes from not having gotten on the path earlier, m w do I feel that way? Would I feel that way? Negative. Don't know. Okay. You were a little late getting in the game, but I'll tell you what, 26 years old, is that what we're talking about? 26 yeah. At 26 years old. You're young and you're young and a, but I'll tell you what, even if, even if you are 40 or 50 or 60 or 70 doesn't matter. You're in the game now and that's, that's what counts. And all those quote unquote wasted years, they, they weren't wasted, right?

Speaker 2:          04:22          They're not wasted because you learned. And specifically what did he learn about? Learned about what it's like to be out of shape, learned about what it's like to be overweight, learn about what it's like to be weak. And the knowledge that you learned about those things is fuel to make sure that it never happens again. Cause you know, you know what is out there and do you know how bad it can get. And in this is the other reason why it's beneficial that you, you have a pass that wasn't perfect is now you can teach other people how to do it very clearly. You know, you can inspire other people to do a look at what you did. Do you, what'd you do to your brother? You know? Right. It's another good example that, so back in the day before anybody knew what Jujitsu was, dairy, uh, I am the worst person to introduce Jujitsu to people because when they see me, cause I'm 225 pounds and um, you know, a big guy and they think, of course this guy can choke me. Of course, you know, they, they don't expect anything else. So when I choked them, they're like, well yeah, you are really strong. So the best people to introduce Jujitsu to people is like Jeff Glover. Yeah. Right? Who's 150 pounds, the skinny guy. And he comes out and shows you a big strong guy 27 times in a row. They say, oh, maybe this stuff works well. It's the same thing here. People look at me, they

Speaker 1:          05:58          gold jock jock who just hardcore, no, not just me looking at you. You're the one that did it. You went through a much bigger transition than I've ever gone through in my life. Yeah. So I say you embrace what you learned from the weekdays. Let them, let them make you even stronger and you use your own personal transformation that you've made in life. Use that to help other people transform and get on the path as well. That's where I'm at. So good. And there's a lot to be said too for that. Like, like how he was talking, this is what I think you mean is how his brother lost 50 pounds. Right? So, and that's like a lot, like a lot of times I feel like when people will do good stuff for themselves and make these big changes, other people who see there's kind of, there's two P, I'm sure there's one, two, but there's two kinds of people were, some will be like, and they'll just hate and there'll be just jealous and they'll, you know, whatever.

Speaker 1:          07:05          But the legit people like in your life are around, you are going to be like, Hey, what'd you do? You know? Even if like even if it's not losing, even if it's like you're making like millions of dollars now, they're like, oh, like what are you doing? You know, you just sorta changed real quick. Like you're now, you're making millions out. What'd you do? I want to do, I want to get on that stuff. Whatever you're doing. And the workout thing, that's a big one. So if like, like a lot of times I girls, they'll lose all this weight and now they're like super chat there, you know, as attractive as they always want it to be kind of thing. All the other girls, what did you do? Oh my gosh. What'd you do? What'd you do? And they want to do it too. It's like, it's almost like almost like you can prove to other walk can be done. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. It's good shit. Stay on that path, man. That's awesome.
