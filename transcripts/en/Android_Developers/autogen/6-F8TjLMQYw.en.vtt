this shows the plus API and scope

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150
this shows the plus API and scope
 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.059
this shows the plus API and scope
this shows the drive API in scope and

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069
this shows the drive API in scope and
 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.339
this shows the drive API in scope and
now the real difference is that now you

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349
now the real difference is that now you
 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.800
now the real difference is that now you
can add multiple API s and scopes easily

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810
can add multiple API s and scopes easily
 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.660
can add multiple API s and scopes easily
which is a huge win in terms of saving

result was successful and uses a
standard set of status codes then you

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350
standard set of status codes then you
 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.759

can proceed and use the result to review

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769
can proceed and use the result to review

everything we went over let's walk

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570
everything we went over let's walk
 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.839
everything we went over let's walk
through an example we are fetching the

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:22.849
through an example we are fetching the
 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:25.250
through an example we are fetching the
visible people in a user's G+ circles

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260
visible people in a user's G+ circles
 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.870
visible people in a user's G+ circles
which can be useful for example to

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880
which can be useful for example to
 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.320
which can be useful for example to
create a social experience in an app

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330
create a social experience in an app
 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.460
create a social experience in an app
first we set up the Google API client

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470
first we set up the Google API client
 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.980
first we set up the Google API client
and set the plus API scope and

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990
and set the plus API scope and
 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.470
and set the plus API scope and
connection callbacks then we implement

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480
connection callbacks then we implement
 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.270
connection callbacks then we implement
the callback methods for connection

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280
the callback methods for connection
 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.090
the callback methods for connection
succeeded suspended or failed the

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100
succeeded suspended or failed the
 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.470
succeeded suspended or failed the
connection could fail because it

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480
connection could fail because it
 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.020
connection could fail because it
requires user intervention for example

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030
requires user intervention for example
 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.450
requires user intervention for example
to choose an account then an intent

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460
to choose an account then an intent
 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.890
to choose an account then an intent
would be returned in the connection

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900
would be returned in the connection
 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.660
would be returned in the connection
result and you should allow the user to

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670
result and you should allow the user to
 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.500
result and you should allow the user to
resolve the problem and connect again

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510
resolve the problem and connect again
 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.000
resolve the problem and connect again
next we call connect and disconnect on

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010
next we call connect and disconnect on
 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.340
next we call connect and disconnect on
the Google API client as soon as a

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350
the Google API client as soon as a
 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.380
the Google API client as soon as a
connection is successful we can fetch

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390
connection is successful we can fetch
 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.180
connection is successful we can fetch
the information our app needs by calling

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190
the information our app needs by calling
 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.970
the information our app needs by calling
a static method in the API which is plus

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:04.980
a static method in the API which is plus
 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.790
a static method in the API which is plus
people API download visible and we pass

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800
people API download visible and we pass
 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.910
people API download visible and we pass
in the Google API client on the pending

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:10.920
in the Google API client on the pending
 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.440
in the Google API client on the pending
result that gets returned we set a

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450
result that gets returned we set a
 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.600
result that gets returned we set a
callback because we want the result

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610
callback because we want the result
 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.450
callback because we want the result
asynchronously in the callback we will

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460
asynchronously in the callback we will
 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.030
asynchronously in the callback we will
receive a load people result which is of

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040
receive a load people result which is of
 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.220
receive a load people result which is of
type result so we can get the status and

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230
type result so we can get the status and
 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.560
type result so we can get the status and
check the status code is successful if

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570
check the status code is successful if
 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.990
check the status code is successful if
all is well then we can obtain the list

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000
all is well then we can obtain the list
 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.460
all is well then we can obtain the list
of people that we're looking for from

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470
