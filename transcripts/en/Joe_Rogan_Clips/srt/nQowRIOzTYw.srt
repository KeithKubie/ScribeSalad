1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,370
The Joe Rogan experience about here's
an interesting cat man. Yes, yes.

2
00:00:05,371 --> 00:00:08,760
A bunch of things rolled
up into one because he's a,

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,340
he's a legitimate Catholic, like
he was really Catholic. Yeah.

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,820
Despite all the scandals and kid
fucking and all the craziness.

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,760
And then on top of that
he's this character,

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,880
but now he's not the character anymore.
No.

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,120
Now he's like a guy who's not
totally playing the character,

8
00:00:27,121 --> 00:00:30,450
but the character comes in and out
like little shadows. Yes, it does.

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,860
It's like what are you,
what's your real thoughts on things?

10
00:00:34,861 --> 00:00:38,070
Cause I know you as Cole Bear. Yeah.
Know you from the Colbert report,

11
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:42,200
this hilarious fake Republican guy
and now I'm seeing you. I'm, I'm not,

12
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:46,440
I'm not sure what's going on here, man.
Yeah. I mean he's, well, and when you're,

13
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:50,250
when you're in late night, you know,
I play a character on my show too.

14
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,010
That's like a heightened version of myself
that's developed as like a very extra

15
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:56,710
nerdy, it's almost like me as peewee
Herman, a little bit like it's, it's uh,

16
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,780
towards me as my younger self. It's like
very socially awkward. I'm a love, oh,

17
00:01:00,781 --> 00:01:02,340
sorry. Like, it's a lot
of up there, you know,

18
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,170
and it's different than what I do
on stage. Uh, and uh, you know,

19
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,170
I can only imagine, even
though he is still, he's like,

20
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,510
his big thing for late night was like,
I'm going to be myself.

21
00:01:12,511 --> 00:01:13,560
I'm not the character anymore.

22
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,030
You still build a little bit of a
character for yourself, you know? Yeah.

23
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:21,000
Well also with him it's like that's
what brought him to the dance. Yeah.

24
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,000
The reason why you, there is like what
kind of meetings that they have with him.

25
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,080
Like what are we going to do here?
We can tie this trait. Pico bear,

26
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,050
I heard him say once, he only said
this in one interview, but he was like,

27
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:33,780
we're basically creating a
new character for late night.

28
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,440
And so he had the same writers from,
from the cold bear rapport. And so, uh,

29
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,990
he was like, we're sort of
like creating a new character.

30
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:43,800
How does this character work? But I
got to say the old show, I mean he's,

31
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:44,813
he's great.

32
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,540
The old show was probably
the best performance ever
made by a single late night

33
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:51,990
comic because the way that
he, when I watch it now, if
I go back and watch clips,

34
00:01:51,991 --> 00:01:56,220
I'm like the way he would do like three
or four fast little turns, you know,

35
00:01:56,221 --> 00:01:56,491
you know,

36
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:59,940
single line where it would like mean one
thing but there'd be some sub tax than

37
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:03,560
he would flip around and he would do it
like it was like watching, um, like a,

38
00:02:03,561 --> 00:02:06,830
a figure skater do triple axles, you
know, like watching him do that. It was,

39
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,860
it was really impressive. I liked
the guy, don't get me wrong, but I,

40
00:02:09,861 --> 00:02:14,170
I like him more on the Colbert report and
I'm like him as a late night talk show

41
00:02:14,171 --> 00:02:15,390
host.
But I do have to agree.

42
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,690
I think that's also my prejudice
against that format. I'm like,

43
00:02:18,691 --> 00:02:22,170
you guys just saw what Jack Parr
did and kept going. Totally.

44
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,340
It's the same goddamn thing. But I
understand why he couldn't do the cold,

45
00:02:25,341 --> 00:02:28,140
but he did that show for like 10 years,
you know, like you can't, you can't do,

46
00:02:28,141 --> 00:02:29,940
that was a limited thing for him.
You know,

47
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:33,450
like he had that character and so he
could only do what was in the box,

48
00:02:33,451 --> 00:02:36,570
that character. And so he's looking
to do more and, and I get it.

49
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,980
I also feel like man,

50
00:02:37,981 --> 00:02:40,650
that Colbert report is more interesting
than the late night show to me is that

51
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:43,140
comic and as a comedy
writing fan for sure,

52
00:02:43,141 --> 00:02:46,680
because the late night shows her just
promotion shows, that's all they are.

53
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,000
All they are is, Hey Adam, I hear
you. Have a book out. Hey Mike,

54
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,940
tell us about your new show. Here's
our 10 minutes of comedy before that.

55
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:55,600
And then we do that. Yeah. It's,

56
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,950
it's basically like a version
of a commercial and the,

57
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:01,570
and the nightly thing is a prison,
you know,

58
00:03:01,571 --> 00:03:04,000
because you can only talk
about what happened that day.

59
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,390
So the smartest thing that
you know, John Oliver, right?

60
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:10,120
He was up for the daily show.
He wanted to do the daily show.

61
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:12,320
He was John Stewart's pick for the
daily show. They said this in the,

62
00:03:12,321 --> 00:03:14,560
in the oral history book
of the daily show. Um,

63
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:18,510
and then comedy central didn't close the
deal with Oliver and HBO came and said,

64
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,920
you want to do a show instead? You know,
and John Stewart was like, all right,

65
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:22,510
go with God.
That's what John Oliver did instead.

66
00:03:22,511 --> 00:03:25,540
So we're living in that alternate reality
from John Oliver Hosting the daily

67
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:28,720
show. Right. And so the smartest
thing I ever did was do weekly,

68
00:03:28,721 --> 00:03:32,830
not daily because it lets him go
wider. Right? If he was doing daily,

69
00:03:32,831 --> 00:03:35,050
he would have to just talk
about what happened that day.

70
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:37,210
You don't have that much.
You don't guess what,

71
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:42,330
you can't have as much of
a complete thought in 24
hours or in realistically the

72
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:45,190
six hours you have between when you show
up. But when you take the show, right,

73
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,440
you can't say as much you it's,
it's harder. And so being on that,

74
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,380
you know, weekly schedule and he's only
doing 30 something shows a year, right.

75
00:03:53,381 --> 00:03:56,860
Cause they have hiatuses
that's what allows them to
have those big long complete

76
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,530
thoughts that everyone likes so much.
You know,

77
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:03,600
these ramps and intelligent takes on
news issues and pointing out hypocrisy.

78
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,850
That's great. Our show, it takes us, we,

79
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:08,980
it takes us like three or four
months to write an episode.

80
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,320
Like we're writing 16 at
once, but like, you know,

81
00:04:11,321 --> 00:04:12,700
that's how long we have to think about it.

82
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:14,650
And so we're able to take
twists and turns, you know,

83
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:17,950
we go into it thinking this is going
to be our angle and then we're,

84
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,740
we're diving into the research. We have
a wonderful research staff and they say,

85
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:24,400
actually this is the more interesting
part of the story and then we are,

86
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,820
have the time to go chase
it that way instead. Right.

87
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,830
Whereas if we were on a daily schedule,
oh shit.

88
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:33,280
Well we don't have time to pivot
because we got a show to make. Right.

89
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:37,150
Do you ever feel time constraints?
Like in terms of like the subject matter,

90
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:40,450
the subject matters, like
very, very involved? Yeah,

91
00:04:40,451 --> 00:04:44,590
I mean we try to do the most
difficult topics. We can't, you know,

92
00:04:44,591 --> 00:04:46,390
we don't hold back from anything.
Um,

93
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:49,180
but the only constraint that
we have is that the show,

94
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:53,080
we've got 21 minutes and then in,
but we've got commercials.

95
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:56,140
So we only talk about some for six
minutes before we have to move on. Right.

96
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,100
And so that's the,
that's the only limitation that we have.
