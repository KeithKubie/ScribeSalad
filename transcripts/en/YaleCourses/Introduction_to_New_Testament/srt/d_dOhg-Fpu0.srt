1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:05,730
Okay. We've already talked
about the problems of using
these texts. Historically.

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,130
If you remember early in the semester,

3
00:00:08,131 --> 00:00:13,131
we talked about Galatians one and two
and acts and we tried to compare exactly

4
00:00:13,531 --> 00:00:18,180
when did Paul go where, uh, with
regard to Jerusalem, Damascus,

5
00:00:18,181 --> 00:00:21,570
Antioch,
and we saw that it's a very,

6
00:00:21,571 --> 00:00:26,410
very difficult to harmonize Galatians
one and two with the account of acts and

7
00:00:26,411 --> 00:00:28,560
Paul's movements around Jerusalem.

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,060
We've also got a lot of other situations
where this would be very difficult.

9
00:00:33,061 --> 00:00:34,230
I mentioned,
um,

10
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,910
the difference between Matthew and Luke
as far as the birth narratives according

11
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:41,370
to just to try to figure
out how this would work.

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,540
If you took the birth narratives of
Matthew and Luke, it would be very,

13
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:50,520
very difficult to find out historically
what happened. Uh, so for example,

14
00:00:50,521 --> 00:00:53,310
if you just take, Matthew
is, I've said before,

15
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,320
his family seems to simply
be in Bethlehem. It doesn't
say they're from Galilee.

16
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,350
It doesn't say they're originally from
Nazareth, there just in Bethlehem,

17
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:03,990
and they're in Bethlehem.
Well before Jesus is born,

18
00:01:03,991 --> 00:01:08,400
because the wise men and the east to see
the star and it takes them enough time

19
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,660
to travel from Persia.

20
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:13,590
We're supposed to understand from the
narrative because they're called mad jai.

21
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:17,100
And those are Wiseman from
Persia all the way to Jerusalem.

22
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,230
They meet up with King Herod the Great,
uh, he, he gets his wise men to consult.

23
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,540
They then find that they're
supposed to go to Bethlehem,

24
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:27,630
they journey to Bethlehem,
and then they get their, uh,

25
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,320
not long after Jesus was born. So
according to Matthew, you don't,

26
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,550
you don't have any time actually in
the narrative of Matthew for the whole

27
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:40,080
moving from Nazareth to
Bethlehem narrative that you
get in the gospel of Luke.

28
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,190
You just don't have time in Matthew.
They're just there. And then, uh,

29
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,890
the angel appears to
Joseph in a dream and says,

30
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:51,090
Herod's going to kill all the babies.
So Joseph takes the family,

31
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:56,110
they moved to Egypt for a while. He
gets another dream years later. What,

32
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:00,690
how many years? Who knows, but, uh,
saying that Herod the great is now dead.

33
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,130
So they go back,

34
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:05,850
they start to go back to Bethlehem
because it says that's their home, right?

35
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,850
They go back home, they're going
to go to Bethlehem. Instead,

36
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,880
they moved to Galilee to avoid Herod's
son who was at the time according to

37
00:02:14,251 --> 00:02:15,510
Matthew,
ruling in Judea.

38
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,550
That's the sort of narrative you
get to Luke. It's very different.

39
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,680
They're from Nazareth. That's sort
of Mary's hometown is Nazareth.

40
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,340
All the pregnancy of Jesus takes
place with Marian Nazareth.

41
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,920
She even goes to Judea to visit
her. Ken's woman, Elizabeth, uh,

42
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,930
who's the mother of John the Baptist
according to the gospel of Luke.

43
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,590
And then she goes back to Nazareth and
then it's according to this census,

44
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:45,240
the world census that they go to Bethlehem
and it's why they're in Bethlehem in

45
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:47,720
the stable because you don't
have a stable in Matthew,

46
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:52,320
you there just maybe in a home or
according to a lot of traditions, uh,

47
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,850
Jesus was, there was a cave somewhere
and that Jesus was born in, but in,

48
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,420
it's in Luke that you get the whole
story about the Christmas store.

49
00:02:59,421 --> 00:03:02,680
About the stable that Jesus is born
in because there's no room in the end.

50
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,500
They stay in that area for a month.

51
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:09,010
We know that because it says that they
first have Jesus circumcised on the

52
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:12,580
eighth day from his birth and in the time
of purification takes place according

53
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:14,500
to Leviticus,
which was about a month long.

54
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:16,780
They take Jesus to the presentation
in the temple in Jerusalem,

55
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,070
and it's after that,

56
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:22,330
so a month or so after his birth that
they then move back home to Nazareth.

57
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:28,380
Now there's no way you can basically get
these two narratives to fit together in

58
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:32,950
any respectable historical way. Does that
mean that nobody's ever tried to do it?

59
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,870
No.
Of course you've got all kinds of very,

60
00:03:34,871 --> 00:03:38,860
very smart fundamentalists who believe
that the new testament has to be accurate

61
00:03:38,861 --> 00:03:43,090
in every historical and scientific
detail or they believe that it's not.

62
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,200
It can't be scripture and they will figure
out some way to try to make sure that

63
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:49,300
both these narratives can be fit together.

64
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:53,260
But what I'm telling you is
that no reputable historian
will accept this because

65
00:03:53,261 --> 00:03:56,470
you just have to fudge that stuff
too much. You have to fudge the data.

66
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,960
So what do we believe
about the birth of Jesus?

67
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,620
Most of us think we don't know
anything about the birth of Jesus.

68
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,980
All the Christmas stories
or later tradition. The pro,

69
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:09,670
probably the one thing that most of us
would say is that Jesus probably was from

70
00:04:09,671 --> 00:04:10,240
Nazareth.

71
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,840
His family was simply from Nazareth
because he's called Jesus of Nazareth.

72
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,950
And the traditions that got him to
Bethlehem for his birth are probably later

73
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:22,720
positivistic traditions, uh, that Matthew
and Luke later developed for different,

74
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:23,741
for different reasons.

75
00:04:23,741 --> 00:04:28,030
But to get Jesus born in Bethlehem
for fulfillment of prophecy reasons.

76
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,010
So if you take the, the births of the
birth of Jesus is in Luke and Matthew,

77
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,200
it's from a historical point of view.

78
00:04:35,201 --> 00:04:39,220
It's impossible really to harmonize
them without coming up with fantastic,

79
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,820
unbelievable,
uh,

80
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:45,130
conjugations of Jesus moving back and
forth to Egypt in the holy family and all

81
00:04:45,131 --> 00:04:45,964
this sort of thing.

82
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:50,500
We get lots of other kinds
of things about this too.

83
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,330
What are some obvious historical
problems with the historical Jesus?

84
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,900
Well,
one of the things is the trial of Jesus.

85
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:04,260
There are different versions of the
trial of Jesus in the Gospels and

86
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:09,870
unfortunately,
basically most scholars will say that we,

87
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,550
we don't really know what
happened to the trial of Jesus.

88
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:16,000
We don't even know for sure whether
there was any kind of official trial.

89
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:19,270
It may have been that he was just
arrested in the middle of the night.

90
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,320
He was just then they've given
permission to be crucified.

91
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:26,170
He was crucified the next day. That would
be the sensible way of doing things.

92
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:30,970
You didn't have to have the Romans
didn't need elaborate trials in order to

93
00:05:30,971 --> 00:05:34,450
crucify Jews who are rabble
rousers in the first century.

94
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,530
They did it all the time, but if you
look at some of the details of the trial,

95
00:05:38,531 --> 00:05:42,580
notice how they're very different.
Mark 14 get your bibles out.

96
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,410
Today we are talking about
the historical Jesus,

97
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:51,040
but I'm not just going to
tell you what I believe,

98
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,810
what scholars believe
about the historical Jesus.

99
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:56,920
I'm going to try to show you why
scholars come up with ideas that we have,

100
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,250
how we get there.

101
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:02,120
What is our method for arriving
at historical Jesus discussions?

102
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,690
So look at mark 14 verse 53

103
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:14,350
I'm
the wrong person.

104
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,530
They took Jesus to the high
priest and all the chief priests,

105
00:06:19,531 --> 00:06:23,040
the elders and the scribes were assembled.
Peter had followed him at a distance,

106
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,400
right into the courtyard of the high
priest and he was sitting with the guards,

107
00:06:26,401 --> 00:06:29,370
warming himself at the fire. Now the
chief priests and the whole counselor,

108
00:06:29,371 --> 00:06:31,530
we're looking for testimony against
you is to put them to death.

109
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,770
But they found none for many
gave false testimony against him.

110
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,920
And their testimony did not agree.
Some students,

111
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,510
Ben gave false testimony against
him saying, we have heard him say,

112
00:06:39,511 --> 00:06:41,640
I will destroy this temple
that is made with hands.

113
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,160
And in three days I will build another,
not made with hands,

114
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,710
but even on this point,
their testimony did not agree.

115
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,310
Then the high priest stood up before them
and that's Jesus have, you know, answer.

116
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,410
What is it that they testify against you?

117
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,190
But he was silent and did not answer
again. The high priest asked him,

118
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:00,210
are you the Messiah, the son of
the blessed one? Jesus said, I am.

119
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,750
And you will see the son of man seated
at the right hand of power and coming

120
00:07:03,751 --> 00:07:06,930
with the clouds of heaven.
That's a quotation from Daniel.

121
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:11,550
So Jesus basically just says, I
am. And then quotes Daniel. Uh,

122
00:07:11,551 --> 00:07:14,310
and then it says,
the high priest accused him of prophecy.

123
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:19,350
And then look at Chapter 15 beginning
of chapter 15 as soon as it was morning,

124
00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:22,050
the chief priests heard of consultation
with the elders and scribes and the

125
00:07:22,051 --> 00:07:26,010
whole council. They bound Jesus, let
him away and handed him over to pilot.

126
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:29,400
Pilot asked him, are you the king of
the Jews? He answered him. You say,

127
00:07:29,401 --> 00:07:32,880
so then the chief priest accused him.
Many things. Pilot asked me again,

128
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:35,610
have you know, answer, see how many
charges they bring against you.

129
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:40,380
But Jesus made no further apply.
So that ply pilot was amazed.

130
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:44,790
Now notice all Jesus says at his trial,
according to mark,

131
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:49,740
the oldest of our written testimonies
is I am. And a quotation of scripture.

132
00:07:49,741 --> 00:07:54,540
At one point and then so you say,
and the next trial before pilot.

133
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,260
Now compare that to what goes
on in the gospel of John.

134
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:02,070
I mentioned this a bit in my lecture
on the gospel of John Howard.

135
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:05,640
It's narrative details are very
different from the synoptic gospels.

136
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,760
One of the places where this is really
different is the trial of Jesus.

137
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:14,210
John 18 verse 19 not gonna read all of
this because it's just way too long.

138
00:08:14,281 --> 00:08:15,114
This is part of the,

139
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:19,440
the interesting thing is that the trial
of Jesus goes on for a long time in the

140
00:08:19,441 --> 00:08:23,190
gospel of John. The high priest
questioned Jesus about his disciples,

141
00:08:23,191 --> 00:08:26,610
about his teaching. Jesus answered,
I have spoken openly to the world.

142
00:08:26,611 --> 00:08:29,310
I have always taught in synagogues
and the temple where all the Jews come

143
00:08:29,311 --> 00:08:32,490
together. I have said nothing in
secret. Why do you ask me already?

144
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,490
Jesus has said a ton more now.

145
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:39,090
Then he said in the other gospels at his
trial, but then he just keeps going on.

146
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:42,120
Uh, they hey said some more
things when he had said this.

147
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:44,250
One of the police standing near
by struck Jesus face thing.

148
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,080
Is that how you answer the high priest?

149
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:48,960
Jesus answered if I have spoken
wrongly testified to the wrong,

150
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:50,730
but if I have spoken rightly,
why do you strike me?

151
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,970
Then Anna sent him bound to
Caiaphas the high priest.

152
00:08:53,971 --> 00:08:58,590
So according to John Annas and Caiaphas
or kin folk and they're sort of both

153
00:08:58,591 --> 00:09:02,370
members of the high priestly
family. So you can go on and on, uh,

154
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:05,820
at 28, verse 28, um,

155
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:09,300
is the trial before, uh,
they took Jesus to pilot.

156
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:13,890
Pilot went out to the Junes that what
accusation do you bring against this man?

157
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,600
The answered if this
man were not a criminal,

158
00:09:15,601 --> 00:09:17,490
we would not have handed him over to you.
Pilot said to them,

159
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,190
take him yourselves and judgment
corn to your law. The Jews answered,

160
00:09:20,191 --> 00:09:24,330
we are not permitted, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah. It
goes on. Pilot talks to Jesus.

161
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:27,660
Are you the king of the Jews? Jesus
answered, do you ask this on your own?

162
00:09:27,661 --> 00:09:30,660
Did not or did others tell you
about pilot? Said, I'm not a Jew,

163
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:33,240
am I your own nation? And the chief
priests had know you over to me.

164
00:09:33,241 --> 00:09:34,590
What have you done?
Jesus said,

165
00:09:34,591 --> 00:09:38,790
my kingdom is Jesus just has a
whole conversation with pilot,

166
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,780
which leads to that wonderfully a quotable
phrase that everybody knows about.

167
00:09:42,781 --> 00:09:43,590
Where,
uh,

168
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:47,790
finally Jesus talks about truth and
pilots says in a phrase that could be

169
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:51,330
sincere or a lot of people answered
as being cynical. What is truth?

170
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,990
Very famous quotation from the
gospel of John. And then of course,

171
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,620
there's a whole passage interview
seeing the, uh, the, uh,

172
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,790
Jesus Christ superstar,
the player, the movie.

173
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,830
There's a whole scene where Herod,

174
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,290
this is actually the son
of Herod the great now,

175
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,360
but there's a trial before Herod also
in the gospel of John. Not Really,

176
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,280
uh,
in market all but in the gospel of John.

177
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:17,820
You get this whole trial before Herod
and of course to Jesus Christ superstar.

178
00:10:17,821 --> 00:10:21,420
This is when Herod kind of dances around
on this raft and has show girls and

179
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:26,290
they all do this. So you are the Christ,
the great Jesus colonized, you know,

180
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,930
prove to me that Jordan,
oh fool.

181
00:10:27,931 --> 00:10:30,510
Walk across Mott's women pool
and all that sort of thing.

182
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,900
So there's a whole scene
and Jesus Christ superstar,

183
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:38,070
the whole scene wouldn't be
possible without the gospel
of John Because it's not

184
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:41,310
in the other gospels.
So this is a famous scene.

185
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,570
All of that's different in John.
So what's historical, how to cook,

186
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,510
how to scholars decide you have
these very, very different,

187
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:53,160
was Jesus completely silent at his trial
as it seems to be in the gospel of Mark?

188
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,540
Did he not offer,
um,

189
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,100
any reasons for what he did or did
he have theological and philosophical

190
00:10:59,101 --> 00:11:02,970
discussions with pilot about his message?

191
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,390
What's historical in that case?

192
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,640
Basically most historians
are going to say,

193
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:12,930
none of it is none of the trial stuff.

194
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,190
Can we be confident would
be historical for one thing,

195
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,220
that we just have this very,
very differences.

196
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,130
But there's one very little interesting
piece of evidence about this.

197
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,140
According to all the gospels,

198
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:29,580
where were the disciples
after Jesus was arrested?

199
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:37,250
Anybody remember,
they've almost the,

200
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:41,070
the gospel say that the disciples
ran away at the arrest of Jesus.

201
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,640
So maybe according to psalms revisions,
according to these traditions,

202
00:11:44,641 --> 00:11:49,641
maybe Peter was there sort of in a
courtyard out removed from the trial,

203
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:55,330
but none of the disciples of Jesus
would have allowed to be present at any

204
00:11:55,331 --> 00:11:58,660
trial. Whether it was as
high priest, our pilot,

205
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,610
they wouldn't have been allowed in.

206
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,220
These were peasants from
Galilee there fishermen,

207
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,160
they don't go walking
into pilots headquarters.

208
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:11,290
So who would have been there to
report these different trial things?

209
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:15,010
There are no stenographers in the ancient
world sitting down taking notes of

210
00:12:15,011 --> 00:12:18,220
these trials.
There are no cry court records.

211
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,170
There are no journalists.

212
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:25,830
Nobody was there who later Christians
had access to so that they could possibly

213
00:12:27,401 --> 00:12:29,230
have known what went on in the trial.

214
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,510
So according to most historians who just
say all of this trial stuff was very

215
00:12:34,511 --> 00:12:37,300
much made up by later Christians.
Why?

216
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,090
Because they figured you had to have
a trial if you're going to have Jesus

217
00:12:40,091 --> 00:12:41,860
condemned. And so they figured, well,

218
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:45,100
what would have taken
place these gospel writers,

219
00:12:45,101 --> 00:12:47,230
or maybe they're using traditions
that developed before them,

220
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:51,070
they're using traditions that developed
because people just say, well,

221
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:55,930
what would have happened at Jesus' trial?
What's likely to have happened?

222
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,310
And then they make up that likeliness
and they put that into the story. Now.

223
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:04,720
So you've got a couple of different
situations where we, historians are very,

224
00:13:04,721 --> 00:13:09,721
very skeptical about some of the basic
aspects of the gospels accounts as far as

225
00:13:10,691 --> 00:13:14,410
what they tell us about the historical
Jesus, the birth narratives.

226
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:19,660
We just throw up our hands,
the trials before pilot. Nope,

227
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,810
probably none of it rises
to the level of history.

228
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:27,160
But this leads to a couple
of different problems.

229
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,950
The first one we'll talk about is,
so what,

230
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,020
and I'm saying this because once his,

231
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,160
once critical scholars tart
talking about the historical Jesus,

232
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:40,240
we immediately start
stepping into sand traps.

233
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:46,290
On the one hand we have good Christian
people who are a bit of a fray,

234
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:52,030
a bit afraid that if you start questioning
there was historical reliability of

235
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:56,620
the gospels, then you're going to
undermine every aspect of Christian faith.

236
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:01,180
If the birth narratives are not,
as they say they are in the gospels,

237
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:04,030
then how can you trust
any of it to be true?

238
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:09,160
And if none of it is true, how do we even
know that Jesus actually even existed?

239
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,860
Or even if he did exist,

240
00:14:11,861 --> 00:14:15,930
how do you know that he wasn't a
liar or a magician or just a bum?

241
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:20,140
How do you, if that's
true, why have faith?

242
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:23,680
Why not just give up the whole thing?
So on the one hand,

243
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:28,740
you've got Christians who
are very threatened by using
typical historical tools

244
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,990
on the gospels and the very
question of the historical Jesus.

245
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:36,881
On the other hand,

246
00:14:36,881 --> 00:14:41,710
we have just as many people who are
anti Christian and who they want to grab

247
00:14:41,711 --> 00:14:43,630
onto this and say,
Aha.

248
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,890
Notice how reputable scholars
like Dale Martin Woolsey,

249
00:14:47,891 --> 00:14:52,250
professor of religious studies at Yale
University points out that not everything

250
00:14:52,251 --> 00:14:53,630
in the gospels is reliably history.

251
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:59,300
Well that means is all a bunch of bunk
and every Christian in the world is

252
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,410
basing their faith on things that
are known by scholars to be lies.

253
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:08,230
Well that's not exactly right either.
Is it so on both,

254
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:12,770
but on both sides you get some people
who say who grab on to any sort of idea

255
00:15:12,771 --> 00:15:14,000
that of his,
that historians would say,

256
00:15:14,001 --> 00:15:17,120
these are the discrepancies in the gospels
are these are places where we don't

257
00:15:17,121 --> 00:15:21,740
have historical evidence to back us up
and they want to run with that precisely

258
00:15:21,741 --> 00:15:26,030
in order to impugn the
faith of Christians now,

259
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:29,600
so scholars have to be very careful
what we basically want to say there.

260
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,600
There was actually a one or two scholars
in the 19th century reputable scholars.

261
00:15:34,971 --> 00:15:39,230
Bruno Bauer was one of them,
a German scholar who denied
that Jesus ever existed.

262
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:40,430
He just said it was all,

263
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,770
even the person of Jesus was
a myth created by the church.

264
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,770
And you'll find every once in a
while somebody on the, you know,

265
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:50,360
on the web or internet or
something, uh, or in some, you know,

266
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:55,540
crazy blog saying that Jesus never existed
but reputable historical scholars all

267
00:15:56,571 --> 00:15:59,600
admit that Jesus of Nazareth existed.
There was a guy back there,

268
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:03,730
Jesus of Nazareth. There's just too
much evidence that existed and it's uh,

269
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,460
just not controvertible when it comes
to reliable historical evidence.

270
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,700
But that's a big difference from
saying, yes, we believe he existed.

271
00:16:10,701 --> 00:16:14,210
And there's some things we think we can
say about him to accepting all of the

272
00:16:14,211 --> 00:16:15,590
gospel materials as reliable.

273
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,560
So scholars basically are
caught in the middle of saying,

274
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,840
we believe there was a Jesus of Nazareth.

275
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:25,930
We believe we might even be able to say
some things as historians about who he

276
00:16:26,601 --> 00:16:28,340
was, what he said, what he did,

277
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,310
why he may have been executed
and that sort of thing.

278
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:37,150
But that means we have to use critical
historical tools to analyze these faith

279
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:42,770
based text, these theological texts.
What are indeed in some cases,

280
00:16:42,771 --> 00:16:43,940
mythological text.

281
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:48,260
We read theological text to try to figure
out what we can say historically and

282
00:16:48,261 --> 00:16:49,490
that leads to the other issue.

283
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:54,290
I keep saying the historical Jesus because
a whole lot of people have the idea

284
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,430
that once I give you the historical Jesus,
then you've got the real Jesus.

285
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:02,990
You've got Jesus as he really was and
thought therefore Jesus has it really is.

286
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:03,981
Now,

287
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:08,981
the problem with that is that theologians
and I can put on my historical hat

288
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:12,650
most of the time, cause I actually
have a job as a historian.

289
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,110
I don't really have a job as a theologian,

290
00:17:15,111 --> 00:17:17,510
so I kind of call myself
sometimes an amateur theologian,

291
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:21,980
but if I want to put on my
amateur theologian hat, I
can make a case for you. Why?

292
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:25,760
The historical Jesus is not a very
good foundation for Christian faith.

293
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:29,030
It's not reliable as a
foundation of Christian faith,

294
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:33,560
it's not sufficient as a foundation for
Christian faith, the theological Jesus,

295
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:37,850
the Jesus of Christian confession
is not the historical Jesus.

296
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,720
The Jesus of theological confession is
that Jesus that matches what the Church

297
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:46,880
has traditionally believed about Jesus.
So for example,

298
00:17:46,881 --> 00:17:50,640
Jesus that matches the creeds.
A Jesus matches Christian confessions.

299
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:54,450
So one of the most important things for
Christian confession, for example, is, uh,

300
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,370
would you lose your faith if you,

301
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,490
if you believe that Jesus wasn't born
in Bethlehem but was rather important,

302
00:17:59,491 --> 00:18:02,820
Nazareth problem, most, most Christians
would probably say, well, no,

303
00:18:02,821 --> 00:18:04,320
that's not really that important.

304
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,920
What's the most central thing for
most Christians, the Christian faith?

305
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:13,020
Do you believe that somehow God was in
Jesus Christ reconciling the world to

306
00:18:13,021 --> 00:18:14,670
himself to quote the Apostle Paul,

307
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:20,040
or do you believe that Jesus Christ is
divine? Do you believe that Jesus is God?

308
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,700
Do you believe that Jesus is
God incarnate God in the flesh?

309
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:27,660
That's a fundamental aspect of
Christian faith for most Christians.

310
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,680
But notice that's not something that
historians can pronounce about one way or

311
00:18:31,681 --> 00:18:32,514
another.

312
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,900
There's no possible way that I practicing
history by the normal historic,

313
00:18:36,901 --> 00:18:41,880
graphical tools of history could tell
you whether God was in Jesus Christ.

314
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,400
Is there, I mean, just think
about it. How would I test that?

315
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:49,230
How would I figure it out?
What would count as a positive proof?

316
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:53,490
What would count as a non controvertible
negative truth? There's no such thing.

317
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,610
So when I'm talking to you
about the historical Jesus,

318
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,860
I have to get over several hurdles.

319
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:03,150
One of the hurdles is trying to show
you that the historical Jesus is a

320
00:19:03,151 --> 00:19:08,151
construction made by historians
practicing the typical trade of modern

321
00:19:08,341 --> 00:19:11,850
historians. It's just like
for example, if I say,

322
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,670
what's the historical Socrates?
We don't,

323
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:19,380
we don't have direct assets to Socrates
either, right? Socrates left no writings.

324
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,820
All we know about Socrates are
mainly the things that either Plato,

325
00:19:23,821 --> 00:19:26,560
his disciples said about
him are xenophobic.

326
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,580
Another of his disciples said
about him and a few other things.

327
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:34,650
And you know what? Plato and Xenophon
don't give the same picture of Socrates.

328
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,120
So figuring out what does,

329
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:40,710
who is the historical Socrates is also
a difficult historical question that

330
00:19:40,711 --> 00:19:41,760
historians debate about.

331
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:46,560
So that's the one thing is just using
typical historical data. So, for example,

332
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:50,550
if I say we're going to talk about
George Washington and we're going to talk

333
00:19:50,551 --> 00:19:52,590
about the George Washington,
that hit of history,

334
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:54,300
the George runs with the
historians will come up with,

335
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,270
that's a different George Washington.
Then say,

336
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,020
let's talk about the George
Washington of popular American piety,

337
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,130
the George Washington of popular American
piety through a dollar across the

338
00:20:05,131 --> 00:20:05,964
Potomac.

339
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:10,770
No historian believes that
George Washington through a
dollar across the Potomac,

340
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,680
at least not Mount Vernon.
If you've been to mount Vernon,

341
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:17,680
you know that's a superhuman
feat. Historians, you know,

342
00:20:17,681 --> 00:20:19,260
in popular American Piety,

343
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,110
George Washington is a little
boy chopped down the cherry tree.

344
00:20:22,111 --> 00:20:25,320
And when his father got onto me, he said,
I cannot tell a lie. Father it is I.

345
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,760
That's a George Washington is the
George Washington of American popular

346
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:33,360
tradition. And it's important to know
about that, about George Washington.

347
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:37,290
No historian believes that
George Washington as a
child actually chopped down

348
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:38,910
the treachery.
And that happened and that happened.

349
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:42,600
And mainly because we actually found
the preacher who made up the story for a

350
00:20:42,601 --> 00:20:45,660
sermon.
It made a good sermon point,

351
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,610
nevermind motto.
What's the motto of the Class Day?

352
00:20:51,611 --> 00:20:55,240
Omni Boosie doobie tandem, especially
when you're listening to preachers

353
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,663
are professors.

354
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:04,150
So the historical Jesus is not the
same thing as the theological Jesus.

355
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:08,140
So that's one point to remember another.
This is another theoretical issue,

356
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,040
and this is very confusing for some
people when you first start thinking about

357
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:12,874
it.

358
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:18,930
We often use the word history in two
different ways and common English.

359
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,143
We,

360
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,740
we often use the word history to
refer simply to stuff in the past.

361
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:32,770
So for example,
the civil war is historical.

362
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:35,770
That just means it happened in the past.

363
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:37,740
Yeah,

364
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,120
that's one way of you art history,

365
00:21:39,121 --> 00:21:43,230
but it's kind of a sloppy way
because if I want to say the history,

366
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,820
the history of the civil war,

367
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,410
I'm not really talking in that
case of the whole civil war, right?

368
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:54,990
A historical account of the civil war
is something is a narrative that will be

369
00:21:54,991 --> 00:21:59,991
constructed by a historian to represent
a story about whatever happened in the

370
00:22:01,351 --> 00:22:04,170
past, but it can't
replicate the past. Right?

371
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,010
In order to replicate the civil war,

372
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,620
you would have to actually have the full,
what, four years, wasn't it? Four years,

373
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,350
however long the civil war took the fight.

374
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:21,330
You'd have to have that amount of time
because every tiny detail, every action,

375
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:24,210
every person, every word, every
letter, everything anybody said,

376
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,250
all every tiny battle,

377
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:31,310
every ant that crawled over a decomposing
corpse is part of the past of the

378
00:22:32,341 --> 00:22:36,490
civil war.
That's not the history of the civil war.

379
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,820
That's the civil war as
it occurred in the past.

380
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,130
The history of the civil war is an account
of whatever happened in the past that

381
00:22:45,131 --> 00:22:48,250
a historian constructs
and then tells you so.

382
00:22:48,251 --> 00:22:50,590
When we use the word history in
that more professional sense,

383
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:55,330
we're not talking about the past. We're
talking about an account of the past.

384
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:00,860
So often philosophers of history like
to separate these two words out and

385
00:23:00,861 --> 00:23:04,990
they'll use the word passed for the
event that occurred in the past.

386
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,790
They'll use the word history for an
account of the event that occurred in the

387
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:14,650
past. Now notice what that means.
Histories are assessable to us,

388
00:23:14,651 --> 00:23:18,550
right? You can go to the store and
buy a history of the civil war.

389
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:23,500
You can buy a history of George Washington
and you can buy a history of Jesus

390
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,333
Christ.

391
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:28,810
Does the history of the civil war that
you buy in the store give you the civil

392
00:23:28,811 --> 00:23:33,400
war? No. It gives you an
account of the civil war.

393
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:38,560
This, the actual civil war is radically
in assessable to you. It's inaccessible.

394
00:23:38,561 --> 00:23:40,840
You can't get it.
Think about this.

395
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:46,680
How would you actually recover
the actual of the civil war?

396
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,850
How would you do it? Let's say you
can't travel in time, like in TV,

397
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,370
let's just say that hypothetically.

398
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,673
Yeah.

399
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:03,590
Does the civil war exists somewhere in
space where the light that is emitted

400
00:24:03,591 --> 00:24:07,940
from it is still flying off in the
universe somewhere and if you could faster

401
00:24:07,941 --> 00:24:10,430
than the speed of light
fly out to that thing,

402
00:24:10,431 --> 00:24:13,340
you could actually experience the
civil war as it actually happened.

403
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:19,430
Well, maybe theoretically, but for
any of us sitting here in this room,

404
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:23,150
that's not possible.
Is it? In other words,

405
00:24:23,151 --> 00:24:24,830
this is a radical thought to some people,

406
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:30,550
but the past no longer
exists for you and me,

407
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,140
it's radically gone.

408
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:37,010
The past is non existent.

409
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:38,560
Yeah.

410
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,140
When it comes to our
experiences of it all,

411
00:24:41,141 --> 00:24:44,560
we can experience our
different accounts of the past.

412
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,590
We can experience different
constructions of the past.

413
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:51,760
We cannot experience the past itself.
It's gone.

414
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:53,470
It's lost to us forever.

415
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:00,920
That means the historical Jesus as
Jesus actually existed in history is in

416
00:25:01,321 --> 00:25:05,190
assessable to you. You will not
find him. You cannot find him.

417
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,630
You will never find him.

418
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:12,950
What you can do is using the trades
that the tricks of the trade of modern

419
00:25:13,171 --> 00:25:14,070
historiography,

420
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:18,450
you can play by the rules of modern
historiography and you can construct a

421
00:25:18,451 --> 00:25:19,620
historical Jesus.

422
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,800
That means a Jesus of Nazareth constructed
using the same kinds of historical

423
00:25:25,801 --> 00:25:29,820
tools as historians would use to construct
the historical George Washington,

424
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:34,980
the historical Socrates, the historical
Plato, the historical Abraham Lincoln.

425
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,620
That's a construction though.

426
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:43,440
So those theoretical points are very
important because when I talk about the

427
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:44,340
historical Jesus,

428
00:25:44,341 --> 00:25:49,140
you cannot think like most popular people
think that what I'm talking about is

429
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:52,470
the real Jesus. The
Jesus, as he really was,

430
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:55,170
are certainly not the
Jesus of Christian faith.

431
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:00,480
What I'm giving you is an account of
Jesus that modern historians construct

432
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:03,420
using the typical tools
of modern historiography.

433
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,290
That's a lot of theoretical
philosophy of history,

434
00:26:07,291 --> 00:26:10,140
stuff that I tried to boil down
and straight forward language.

435
00:26:10,141 --> 00:26:13,980
Is there any question or comments
about that before I go on?

436
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,750
All that stuff is necessary though,
because people,

437
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:20,940
especially when they
turned to objects of faith,

438
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,710
did you start asking historical questions?
People's minds start turning into mud.

439
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,820
All right,
now let's just jump right in.

440
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:34,440
What could we say about the historical
Jesus as historians? I'm today.

441
00:26:34,441 --> 00:26:37,590
I can't give you the whole thing
if you want the whole thing,

442
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,980
all the answers to life.
Uh,

443
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:44,220
well I won't give you cooking
and that kind of thing.

444
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:48,060
But if you want all the
answers to historical Jesus
stuff as it comes from the

445
00:26:48,061 --> 00:26:49,270
Export Wa,

446
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:55,620
you can take my seminar in the fall
that I'll be teaching on the historical

447
00:26:55,621 --> 00:26:59,010
Jesus a whole semester just on
the historical Jesus question.

448
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,740
So I'll do that in the fall.

449
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:07,010
I'm going to give you in the next 20
minutes a little version of sort of the

450
00:27:07,651 --> 00:27:09,780
results.
I'll show you some of the results that we,

451
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:13,470
that I would say about the historical
Jesus. And I'd also say that Bart Erhman,

452
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:17,370
the author of your textbook will agree
with most of this in his chapter in your

453
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:19,020
textbook.
If you want more of that.

454
00:27:19,021 --> 00:27:21,930
Bart Ehrman has a book on
the historical Jesus called,

455
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,680
I think it's called Jesus of Nazareth,

456
00:27:24,681 --> 00:27:27,060
the third apocalyptic
prophet of a new millennium.

457
00:27:27,061 --> 00:27:29,520
It's also published by Oxford press.
It's several years old,

458
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:33,000
but he and I agreed to a great
extent about this sort of thing.

459
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,890
So if you want more of
this, you can look at, uh,

460
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:38,760
Bart's book and it'll pretty much agree
with a lot of this stuff that I'm going

461
00:27:38,761 --> 00:27:43,440
to say. Or you can take my seminar next
fall. So here are some things that we,

462
00:27:43,441 --> 00:27:46,650
I think we can agree about.
Most historians might agree about that.

463
00:27:46,651 --> 00:27:49,320
The historical Jesus,
and then I'll tell you how we got there.

464
00:27:49,321 --> 00:27:53,340
So we're going to talk about first some
results and then some methodology. First,

465
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:55,530
the sign on the cross.

466
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,640
Does anybody remember what the sign on
the Cross when Jesus is crucified says,

467
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,350
pardon?
Say it again.

468
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:14,080
Jesus of Nazareth. King of the
Jews. Anybody else? What did,

469
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,650
what did you say?
You're not here lies,

470
00:28:16,651 --> 00:28:20,280
but there's one versus this is Jesus
and Netapp and it's because the four

471
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,290
different gospels have
slightly different wording,

472
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:27,690
but they all have something version of
Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews,

473
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:32,190
which is of course why you sometimes
see this abbreviated from the Latin,

474
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,860
right?
If you've seen it in churches

475
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:45,130
injury. Have you ever seen that on a
cross or something like that in a church?

476
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:50,080
Yeah. Jesus of Nazareth
in Latin. Rex King.

477
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:54,010
Your dorm of the Jews.
So that.

478
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:58,090
Notice how though it's slightly different.
Let's look, if you've got your bibles,

479
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:03,180
it's mark 1526 if you've got
a parallel version throat,

480
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:06,760
I'm going to be looking at Throckmorton
cause it has the synoptic parallels.

481
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:12,030
It's Throckmorton paragraph two 49 but
somebody put your finger on mark 1526

482
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,260
it's also Matthew 27 37

483
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:19,783
yeah,

484
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,650
it's also Luke 2138

485
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:31,580
and it's also John 1919

486
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:38,590
now in Mark 1526 it says the inscription
of the charge against him read the king

487
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,620
of the Jews. That's it. And
it goes on to buy this stuff.

488
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:49,150
Look over right next to it. Ah,
on Matthew says over his head,

489
00:29:49,151 --> 00:29:52,870
they put the charging per se. This
is Jesus, the king of the Jews.

490
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:54,100
So it's slightly different.

491
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:59,050
Luke 23

492
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:06,670
what'd I say? 38 there it is a hump.

493
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:10,520
There was also an inscription over him.
This is the king of the Jews.

494
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,560
And who has the John Version?

495
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:17,750
John 1919 did anybody put
their finger on John 1919

496
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:20,900
Jesus of Nazareth.
King of the Jews.

497
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:25,530
And doesn't it say in John that it was
in different languages or am I ready to

498
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:29,870
frigging that's right. Hebrew, Latin
and Greek and the gospel of John.

499
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,100
So that's what we've got.

500
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:37,150
What are the things that most scholars
will say is we think that's historical.

501
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:42,810
And why do we think it's
historical? Well, for one thing,

502
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:46,440
it comes from at least two
independent sources, right?

503
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:49,650
What are the two independent
sources that it comes from?

504
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:53,760
It's in all four gospels, but all four
gospels aren't independent sources,

505
00:30:53,761 --> 00:30:57,330
are they? Right. Because we believe
that Matthew and Luke used mark.

506
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:02,340
So if Matthew and Luke copied it from
mark, that makes mark one source.

507
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:05,400
Did the author of John
Hughes The Gospel of Mark?

508
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:09,450
Not according to the theory we're using
in this class. Some people might say, yes,

509
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:10,260
some scholars might tickets,

510
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:13,890
but in this class we're going on the
theory that the gospel of John Probably

511
00:31:13,891 --> 00:31:15,540
didn't use mark as one of his sources.

512
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:18,330
So you've got the gospel of
John is one source for this.

513
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,610
You've got the gospel of mark
is another source for this.

514
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:24,390
So you have to have what scholars are
willing to treat as independent sources,

515
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:28,200
which both had this nice little
piece of data is data right there.

516
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:31,310
Now the other thing is that it
might be interesting to you,

517
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:36,560
for you to know king of the Jews is
not a Christological title that early

518
00:31:37,891 --> 00:31:41,850
Christians used about Jesus
and the gospels who sit in it.

519
00:31:41,851 --> 00:31:46,020
And we've seen a lot of different
titles for Jesus. He's the teacher,

520
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:49,920
he's the son of God, he's the
Messiah, he's the holy one of Israel.

521
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:54,410
We just saw he has a lot of things and
these things are obviously things art of

522
00:31:54,411 --> 00:31:57,120
Christians called him Lord.
They called him son of God,

523
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,570
but they didn't call him king of the Jews.

524
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,290
It was one of the titles
of Jesus that are the,

525
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,260
apparently the earliest followers
of Jesus didn't latch onto.

526
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,250
So we don't see it in the, in the, uh,

527
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,210
letters of Paul and we don't
see it elsewhere in the gospels.

528
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:14,760
So what scholars have said is,
look,

529
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:19,710
this thing king of the Jews doesn't
look like a Christological confessional

530
00:32:19,711 --> 00:32:22,950
title that Christians made up
and then put into the Gospel.

531
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:29,090
It goes against the tendency of the
Christian writers themselves because it's

532
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:34,230
not one of their titles. If it had
said, this is Jesus of Nazareth,

533
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:37,590
the Lord of Heaven and earth,
then scholar who say, well,

534
00:32:37,591 --> 00:32:41,060
that sounds like a Christian confession,
but saying Jesus of Nazareth,

535
00:32:41,061 --> 00:32:43,670
King of the Jews doesn't sound
like a Christian confession.

536
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:48,260
So it goes against the tendency of the
riders themselves and then we say, well,

537
00:32:48,261 --> 00:32:49,310
maybe then it's historical.

538
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:51,890
Maybe it's a little glimpse
of history sitting in there.

539
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:55,400
So that's one thing that
the sign on the cross,

540
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:59,540
most scholars say that's historical.
Now talk about why that's important.

541
00:32:59,541 --> 00:33:01,940
It's a very small detail, but it
could be very important. Yes sir.

542
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:11,750
It could have. Exactly. In other
words, in the SA, the question was,

543
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:15,590
didn't this come from the mocking terms
in the trial? That's exactly right.

544
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:19,610
The Christians, if you notice, it's
the people who are mocking Jesus,

545
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,660
who call him king of the
Jews. And so why, you know,

546
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,840
this is not something that the Christian
writers want to invent and then put in

547
00:33:26,841 --> 00:33:30,680
the story
exactly that supports that point.

548
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:33,590
So that is a nice little detail.

549
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:36,770
One of the things that scholars
often say may well be historical.

550
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:42,350
Jesus was baptized by John The baptist.
Now notice how,

551
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:46,520
why would scholars say this is historical?
Well,

552
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:49,550
there's not complete agreement
about how it happened.

553
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:55,250
There's the gospel of John doesn't exactly
tell you about the baptism of Jesus

554
00:33:55,251 --> 00:33:59,240
by John, but it has Jesus and his
disciples also baptized in the Jordan,

555
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:02,980
and it has Jesus very much connected to
John the Baptist in the beginning of his

556
00:34:02,981 --> 00:34:06,770
gospel. The other gospels do
have Jesus baptized by John.

557
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:09,500
But notice how the story goes along.

558
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:13,010
All of the writers who
has the gospel of John,

559
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,860
who have Jesus baptized
by John The baptist,

560
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:19,820
they have Jesus come to John the Baptist
and they say, I want to be baptized.

561
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:23,120
And John Benson says, oh
no, I shouldn't baptize you.

562
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:28,790
You're the big Kahuna. You're bigger
than I am. I should, you know,

563
00:34:28,791 --> 00:34:32,750
I'm not worthy to untie your sandals.
So I should be baptized by you.

564
00:34:32,751 --> 00:34:36,440
You shouldn't, I shouldn't
be baptizing you. And Jesus
says, no, no, no, it's okay.

565
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:38,360
Baptize me.
And so he does it.

566
00:34:38,361 --> 00:34:41,090
And then you have the confession and
the voice from heaven and that sort of

567
00:34:41,091 --> 00:34:43,790
thing.
Notice what's going on here.

568
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:47,840
The Gospel writers are very concerned
because they know that it could be

569
00:34:47,841 --> 00:34:51,000
interpreted that John Bad Tizen,

570
00:34:51,001 --> 00:34:56,001
Jesus makes John Superior to Jesus
and makes Jesus a disciple of John.

571
00:34:57,290 --> 00:35:00,380
And they're not comfortable with that
because of course they believe Jesus is

572
00:35:00,381 --> 00:35:03,650
the Messiah. And so he's therefore
superior to John The baptist.

573
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,340
And John the Baptist was just a
prophet or a precursor to Jesus.

574
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:12,880
So the story is told to play down this
baptism a bit and make Jesus come out as

575
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:18,710
insisting on the baptism, wanting to
do it for the right kinds of reasons,

576
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:21,680
but not making Jesus a disciple of John.

577
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:27,560
And also this tradition about the baptism
of Jesus is in different sources in

578
00:35:27,561 --> 00:35:29,390
different ways.
So again,

579
00:35:29,391 --> 00:35:34,391
scholars say the baptism of John the
Baptist baptizing Jesus doesn't look like

580
00:35:35,271 --> 00:35:38,040
something early Christians would make up.
In fact,

581
00:35:38,041 --> 00:35:42,180
you can even see that they try to
tone down its implications so it's not

582
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:43,440
something they are likely to make up.

583
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:48,480
It kind of goes against their tradition
of raising Jesus up completely and

584
00:35:48,481 --> 00:35:51,660
therefore it may be historical.
Notice what we've got.

585
00:35:51,661 --> 00:35:56,661
Then we've got two very small details
that a lot of scholars would say probably

586
00:35:57,121 --> 00:36:01,500
our historical because they seem to be
witnessed by more than one source and

587
00:36:01,501 --> 00:36:05,790
they also seem to go against
the theological tendency
of the documents in which

588
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:09,060
they're found and they
frame the gospel of Jesus,

589
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:14,300
the baptism of Jesus at the beginning
of his ministry and the charge on the

590
00:36:14,821 --> 00:36:17,100
cross at the end of his ministry.

591
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,690
And now I'm going to back up those
those two events. Let's just say,

592
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:25,020
I'm going to argue that those two are
certain historical events in the life of

593
00:36:25,021 --> 00:36:27,540
Jesus and then we'll fill in
some of the other details later.

594
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:31,620
But right now let's talk about method.
How did I get here? First method,

595
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,600
first little rule,

596
00:36:33,601 --> 00:36:37,320
and this is something that a lot of
people use when they do historical Jesus

597
00:36:37,321 --> 00:36:37,890
research.

598
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:41,820
It took all the 20th century for people
kind of develop these rules and to spell

599
00:36:41,821 --> 00:36:45,780
them out in scholarship. But this is
kind of where we are now. The first rule,

600
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:47,490
multiple attestation.

601
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:54,283
Yeah.

602
00:36:55,660 --> 00:37:00,660
That means when you have more than one
independent source that has a saying or

603
00:37:01,271 --> 00:37:05,200
an event about Jesus,
you tend to give it a little more weight.

604
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:08,560
Now, of course, what
are independent sources?

605
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:11,320
If you have something in
both Matthew and Luke,

606
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,990
that doesn't count as two
independent sources, right?

607
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,990
Because both Matthew and Luke could
have been gotten that from mark or they

608
00:37:16,991 --> 00:37:18,010
could have gotten it from queue.

609
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,480
But if you have something in mark
and you have something in John,

610
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,330
well those are two independent sources.

611
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:29,080
If you also have something in the gospel
of Thomas that most of us scholars

612
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:30,340
would say,
well they've got,

613
00:37:30,341 --> 00:37:32,740
some people say the gospel of Thomas
May have known the other gospels,

614
00:37:32,741 --> 00:37:36,130
but most of us will say we're going to
treat him as an independent source cause

615
00:37:36,131 --> 00:37:39,160
his, he's not verbatim quoting the
other gospels most of the time.

616
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,760
So if you have an event or a saying that
occurs in mark and John and Q are in,

617
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,490
got in Thomas,
those are three independent sources.

618
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:51,200
What if it also occurs in
Paul Paul's letters? Ah,

619
00:37:51,201 --> 00:37:53,820
there's another independent
source as we'll see that there.

620
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:57,820
There are some places where Paul gives
us a little clue about something and then

621
00:37:57,821 --> 00:38:00,400
obviously you can take Q as
being one of those sources.

622
00:38:00,401 --> 00:38:04,300
So if something is in both Matthew
and Luke but it's not in mark,

623
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:05,590
then you can say it's in queue.

624
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:10,210
And sometimes people would even say you
have one form of a parable that seems to

625
00:38:10,211 --> 00:38:14,380
have occurred in queue and you have a
different form of that parable that seems

626
00:38:14,381 --> 00:38:17,560
to occur in mark. And
then you can say, okay,

627
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:22,540
we have this one parable
in two independent sources.
One is Q and one is mark,

628
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:26,170
but that's kind of complicated because
of course the very definition of what's

629
00:38:26,171 --> 00:38:30,550
in queue is something is in both Matthew
and Luke, but not in mark usually.

630
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:34,930
But if something's in more than
one source, it fits this criteria.

631
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:40,620
Now remember criteria is the
plural criterion is a singular.

632
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,760
Okay,
second

633
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:50,300
the,
actually let me illustrate this again.

634
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,070
One of the things that the sign of the
cross is one of the things cause it got

635
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:54,981
the divorce.

636
00:38:54,981 --> 00:38:59,981
Sangs is another situation according
to mark 10 and Matthew 19 you have this

637
00:39:00,141 --> 00:39:02,360
saying what God has joined together,

638
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:05,210
let no man put asunder and then
you have a few other things.

639
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:09,590
Clearly Jesus in this passage is teaching,
no divorce for his disciples,

640
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:13,760
no divorce at all, period. None
against the rule to get divorced.

641
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:19,420
But then Matthew five 32 has a parallel
with Luke 1618 which makes it look like

642
00:39:20,211 --> 00:39:22,460
a Q source and that has this v wording.

643
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:26,960
Every man who divorces his
wife and marries another
commits adultery and whoever

644
00:39:26,961 --> 00:39:30,050
marries a woman who has been divorced
by her husband commits adultery.

645
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,570
In other words,
there's another teaching on divorce here,

646
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:35,510
both of which forbid it also
forbids divorce and remarriage,

647
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,760
but it's not the same wording as in mark.

648
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:43,250
So scholars say that looks like a Q
saying on divorce in which Jesus still

649
00:39:43,251 --> 00:39:47,090
forbids divorce and remarriage, but it's
not the same wording as the mark saying.

650
00:39:47,091 --> 00:39:50,960
So we have two separate
sayings in different wordings,

651
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:55,490
but they both have Jesus
forbidding divorce and at
least divorce and remarriage.

652
00:39:55,850 --> 00:40:00,020
One in Q one in mark two independent
sources is, it's really neat.

653
00:40:00,021 --> 00:40:04,940
Then we find Paul in First Corinthians
seven 10 through 11 says this,

654
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:09,020
so this is Paul, a quotation from
Paul to those who are married,

655
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:11,540
I command that is Paul.
And then he says,

656
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:16,600
not I but the Lord also Paul even knows
he's quoting a saying of the Lord Jesus.

657
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:22,610
So he goes on to say that the woman must
not separate from her husband if indeed

658
00:40:22,611 --> 00:40:23,480
she does separate,

659
00:40:23,481 --> 00:40:26,990
let her remain unmarried or be reconciled
to her husband and Amanda does not put

660
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:27,824
away his wife.

661
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:31,360
Now most of us believe that's Paul's
wording because you can tell the way he's

662
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:33,470
kind of fudging around with
some of the details of the same,

663
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:38,770
but at least Paul gives a witness that
he knows of an anti divorce saying by

664
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:39,201
Jesus.

665
00:40:39,201 --> 00:40:44,201
Also three separate independent witnesses
that Jesus taught against divorce.

666
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:52,060
One from mark that Matthew copies one
from Q that both mark and Matthew and Luke

667
00:40:52,311 --> 00:40:53,960
have and one from Paul.

668
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:59,920
So that passes the multiple attestation
rule but it also passes the next rule,

669
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,690
which is this similarity.

670
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:07,970
Yeah.

671
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:12,650
When you find something in a source occur
early Christian source that seems to

672
00:41:12,651 --> 00:41:17,480
go against the very inclinations of
that source or of early Christianity,

673
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:20,420
it has. Um, it's more
likely to be historical

674
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:25,790
something that swims against the
tide of early Christian expectation.

675
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:30,110
Now why does the divorce divorce thing
is multiple attested is also present the

676
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,980
this similarity thing, because
almost all of these, except for mark,

677
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:38,240
they both seem to know that Jesus
prohibited divorce entirely.

678
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:41,900
But then they go on to modify the rule
a bit because I mean let's face it,

679
00:41:41,901 --> 00:41:46,340
people get divorced early Christians
got divorced. So Paul says, okay,

680
00:41:46,341 --> 00:41:47,151
well you're not as good words,

681
00:41:47,151 --> 00:41:49,550
but if you do get divorced
then you should do this.

682
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:55,840
So that very riders who pass on an anti
divorce saying also fudge the saying

683
00:41:56,691 --> 00:41:57,350
just a bit,

684
00:41:57,350 --> 00:42:01,250
which shows that the saying is more
radical than their own ethics are.

685
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:02,660
In other words,

686
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:07,220
the anti divorce saying is dissimilar
to the right practices are these early

687
00:42:07,221 --> 00:42:10,430
Christians. It's more radical than
they get themselves practicing.

688
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:14,930
And that's a clue that the saying
itself goes back to the historical Jesus

689
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:16,460
according to this method.

690
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,000
So dissimilarity is any kind of thing
that doesn't fit early Christian

691
00:42:22,611 --> 00:42:25,160
tendencies. The sign on the
cross, I talked about that.

692
00:42:25,161 --> 00:42:28,100
It wasn't a confession of Jesus,
the baptism of John.

693
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:31,460
It's not something that likely would
have invented. Um, there's another one,

694
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:32,430
the swords at Jews,

695
00:42:32,431 --> 00:42:37,070
his arrest and cardiac and mark 1447
and it's followed by Matthew and Luke.

696
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:42,730
Somebody had a sword at Jesus' arrest
in the garden and somebody used it

697
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:45,650
according to the different traditions.
It was Peter,

698
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:50,270
according to John and somebody may there
others don't name somebody whacked off

699
00:42:50,271 --> 00:42:52,670
the hype,
the era of the high priest slave.

700
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:56,280
But there's these different stories
about Jesus. Somebody in Jesus,

701
00:42:56,281 --> 00:43:00,440
his entourage was armed.
And in some of the sources,

702
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,170
one of the sources, there are two
of them on. There are two swords.

703
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,460
Others is one sword. Now I
think this is historical. Why?

704
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:11,330
Because all the gospel writers want to
go out of their way to say Jesus was not

705
00:43:11,331 --> 00:43:15,410
mounting a violent revolution. He
was not a criminal. He was not.

706
00:43:15,411 --> 00:43:16,670
This was not an armed rebellion.

707
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:21,920
He's completely innocent of any political
charge of insurrection. But if Paul, if,

708
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:27,080
if Jesus's disciples were armed with
swords at his arrest in the middle of the

709
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:30,950
night at the Passover in Jerusalem,
that's insurrection. Folks,

710
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:35,500
the Romans did not allow Jews just to
go around in the middle of the night and

711
00:43:35,501 --> 00:43:36,760
gardens carrying swords

712
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,990
for a Jew to be armed at the Passover.

713
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:44,890
An especially dangerous time that the
Romans were really worried about for a Jew

714
00:43:44,891 --> 00:43:45,580
to be armed,

715
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:49,660
following around a guy who some people
were saying was the king of the Jews,

716
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:54,530
you can be arrested for that.
You can be crucified for that.

717
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:57,410
So I don't think early
Christians invented it.

718
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:01,850
I think some of these early Christians
knew that at least one and possibly more

719
00:44:01,851 --> 00:44:06,200
of Jesus' disciples were armed.
It is arrest.

720
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:08,600
So that's another.
Why do I see that?

721
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:10,190
Cause it's not something they
would invent it. In fact,

722
00:44:10,191 --> 00:44:14,150
that goes against their tendency.
There's another passage,

723
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:19,190
mark 10 18 mark 10 18 which is also in
Luke 1819 you may have come across this,

724
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:24,530
the man comes and ask Jesus about
what should I do have turned a live?

725
00:44:24,531 --> 00:44:28,000
What's the good thing for me to do?
And Jesus says, why do you call?

726
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,500
Why do you ask me about the good?
There is no one good but God.

727
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:38,270
Now apparently mark riding that
didn't have a theological hiccup,

728
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:42,960
but now let me, I, you know,
I'm a good episcopalian. Okay,

729
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:49,170
why should you ask Jesus about the good?
God's the only one who is good.

730
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:54,150
Sound weird.
If Jesus is actually God,

731
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:57,720
then you wouldn't say it like that.
In other words,

732
00:44:57,721 --> 00:45:00,750
this sounds like whoever's this saying,

733
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,660
it sounds like Jesus himself
is denying that he's God.

734
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:05,760
Don't ask me about the good.

735
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:10,740
The only who knows about good is God
and he just goes on answer the question.

736
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:16,260
I think this saying was actually something
like this was said by the historical

737
00:45:16,261 --> 00:45:20,610
Jesus. Why? Because early followers of
Jesus believed Jesus. Jesus was God.

738
00:45:20,611 --> 00:45:24,090
In some sense. I don't think this
is something they would invent.

739
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,980
It goes against their confession.
It goes against their theology,

740
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:34,670
so it's one of these cases where it's
dis similar to their faith and therefore

741
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:37,140
we tend to give it higher grade.

742
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:40,950
When it comes to a
historical has historicity,

743
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:44,970
a couple of other
criteria are a bit weaker.

744
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:49,260
These are the two
strongest social coherence.

745
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:57,570
This is when you say you see something
that is either anachronistic and it

746
00:45:57,571 --> 00:46:01,470
doesn't look like it would fit in with
the life of Jesus or it does fit very

747
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:04,230
well with the life of Jesus.
If I decide, for example,

748
00:46:04,231 --> 00:46:07,860
on lots of different other things that
I've decided are historical because of

749
00:46:07,861 --> 00:46:08,694
these other reasons,

750
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:12,330
and then something looks like a saying
of Jesus looks like its apocalyptic and

751
00:46:12,331 --> 00:46:14,670
I've already established that
Jesus was an apocalyptic prophet,

752
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:18,510
then I'm going to say, well, it
coheres with the social situation of,

753
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:23,670
of Jesus as an apocalyptic Prophet in
Galilee or take a negative example in

754
00:46:24,811 --> 00:46:28,920
Matthew 18 there are a lot of rules
about what you should do in the church.

755
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:30,780
The very word church is used.

756
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:34,800
Almost all of us scholars would say a
lot of that stuff in Matthew 18 about the

757
00:46:34,801 --> 00:46:38,730
church, the church rules, a church
leadership. That's not historical. Why?

758
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:41,550
Because the church didn't
exist in Jesus' lifetime.

759
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:46,500
Jesus sounds like he's giving rules
about a constitution for a church,

760
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:48,510
but we think that's anachronistic.

761
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,720
The church is something that
developed after Jesus' death.

762
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:55,680
When his followers came to believe
that he had been raised from the dead.

763
00:46:55,681 --> 00:46:59,740
And then they should continue doing
things in his name, but in Jesus,

764
00:46:59,741 --> 00:47:01,470
his own lifetime traveling around Galilee,

765
00:47:01,471 --> 00:47:04,500
talking about now when you have the
church, you should meet on Sundays.

766
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:09,480
I think for Easter you should
wear white. Um, you know,

767
00:47:09,481 --> 00:47:10,770
Jesus didn't do this sort of thing.

768
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:14,580
So that all of that stuff in Matthew 18,

769
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:17,070
that looks very much
like a later church life,

770
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:21,870
we believe was read back into the life
of Jesus by the author of Matthew or

771
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:25,960
other people. And then
the last thing is, uh,

772
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:29,860
the last criterion is rather we,
it's call the coherent coherence.

773
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,770
And this basically just says,

774
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:37,030
if you can establish something as being
historical about Jesus by these other

775
00:47:37,031 --> 00:47:40,840
stronger criteria, and then something
else seems to cohere with it,

776
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:42,550
then you can kind of throw it in the pot.

777
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:46,990
But it's a very loose kind of criteria
to use for historical purposes.

778
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:52,720
Now. So where are we?
That's the methodology.

779
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:55,630
If we're going to come up with
some basic ideas about Jesus.

780
00:47:55,631 --> 00:47:59,890
Here's where I would say I would end
up with, and there's some of this,

781
00:47:59,891 --> 00:48:00,850
it's very controversial.

782
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:04,600
I would say though that Jesus
was an apocalyptic prophet,

783
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:07,710
an apocalyptic Jewish prophet.
One of the reasons that Jesus,

784
00:48:07,711 --> 00:48:11,260
his life was framed by
two apocalyptic events.

785
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:16,090
If Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist
and John the Baptist seems clearly to

786
00:48:16,091 --> 00:48:19,270
have been preaching some
kind of apocalyptic message
about the coming kingdom.

787
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:23,680
That means I think that Jesus was
originally a follower of John the Baptist,

788
00:48:23,830 --> 00:48:25,900
although the later gospel writers,
we'll play that down.

789
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:29,500
If Jesus was a follower of an
apocalyptic Jewish prophet,

790
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:32,120
I think that at least means
that hit the beginning of his,

791
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:37,320
his own ministry was wreathed in that
apocalyptic Jewish prophecy kind of world,

792
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:43,020
and he was executed on a charge of
sedition as being the king of the Jews

793
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:45,220
against the law.

794
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:50,280
Only the Roman Senate got to make kings
and if Jesus was going around claiming,

795
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:51,790
and,
and I'm not saying he was claiming,

796
00:48:51,791 --> 00:48:54,580
but if other people were claiming
that he was the king of the Jews,

797
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:58,210
the only way to understand that I think
in this situation is that he believed

798
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:02,740
that he was going to be the messiah
that would come at the end of time and

799
00:49:02,741 --> 00:49:06,940
overthrow the Romans.
So his death was also apocalyptic.

800
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:09,460
The temple incident.
We could talk about that.

801
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,820
We did Jesus go in and throw the money
changes out and cleanse the temple as it

802
00:49:12,821 --> 00:49:14,440
said.
I think that's historical.

803
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:18,220
It goes against the tendency of the
gospels to portray Jesus as nonviolent and

804
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:22,600
non confrontational in that last week.
I think he therefore did it.

805
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,600
What did it mean?
I think this is more debatable.

806
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:30,010
I think it was a prophecy meant to enact
what he saw was becoming the future

807
00:49:30,011 --> 00:49:34,150
destruction of the temple by God
in some kind of apocalyptic event.

808
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:34,983
At the end of time,

809
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:40,830
I think Jesus was therefore a lower
class Jewish peasant who spoke mainly

810
00:49:41,771 --> 00:49:42,604
Aramaic.

811
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:47,590
I think he had a group of disciples
of 12 I won't go into some of these,

812
00:49:47,591 --> 00:49:52,120
but I think he actually did form 12 of
his disciples to be an inner core group.

813
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:56,110
I think even that's apocalyptic.
Why would he have 12 disciples?

814
00:49:56,111 --> 00:50:00,220
Why do you choose the number 12 because
there were 12 tribes of Israel that

815
00:50:00,221 --> 00:50:03,670
would be reconstituted at the end of time,
according to Judas expectation.

816
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:08,350
I think there are also women.
There were part of his inner circle,

817
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:12,250
and this is because women later in early
Christianity were marginalized from

818
00:50:12,251 --> 00:50:13,150
leadership positions,

819
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:16,660
but there's all kinds of evidence from
the resurrection narratives to the

820
00:50:16,661 --> 00:50:20,350
presence of Mary Magdalene to other
women that they were part of his inner

821
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:25,210
circle of disciples. I think that he
never taught the end of the Jewish law,

822
00:50:25,211 --> 00:50:27,040
but I think he did teach
what was something,

823
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:31,010
a liberalizing version of the Jewish law.
In other words,

824
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:36,280
that you're the ethical treatment of
other your fellow human beings counted as

825
00:50:36,741 --> 00:50:40,880
more important than actual details
of observing the Jewish law,

826
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:44,540
such as keeping kosher, washing
your hands, keeping the sabbath.

827
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:50,240
What did Jesus think he was the Messiah?
I think this is a really big problem.

828
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:51,343
I don't know.

829
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:56,830
There seem to be places where he makes
no open claim to Messiah ship in his

830
00:50:57,410 --> 00:51:00,770
ministry except in the gospel of John,
members of the gospel of John. Actually,

831
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:03,740
we tend to treat that as less historically
reliable in these things because it

832
00:51:03,741 --> 00:51:06,440
looks very much more Christian
theological confession.

833
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:08,660
But in the synoptic gospels,

834
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:12,980
Jesus doesn't make open
claims to being messiah.

835
00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:16,940
On the other hand, he was executed
for being king of the Jews,

836
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:21,710
so the Romans at least thought he was
claiming to be the messiah or they thought

837
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:23,510
that other people were
claiming that about him.

838
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:24,820
Okay,

839
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:28,390
but what he thought himself is very
difficult. One of the things though,

840
00:51:28,391 --> 00:51:31,420
I can see, I think we can say for
sure, this is where I'll end today.

841
00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:34,570
Jesus himself,
I believe,

842
00:51:34,571 --> 00:51:37,630
never saw himself as the
founder of Christianity.

843
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:42,800
He didn't think about himself
as starting a new religion.

844
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:48,760
I believe he saw himself as preparing
the people of Israel to make them ready

845
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:53,840
for the apocalyptic inbreaking of God.
There was to happen.

846
00:51:53,841 --> 00:51:56,780
At the end of time,
or at the end of our time,

847
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:00,740
and the setting up of a new
time of the Kingdom of God,

848
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:03,830
the Kingdom of Israel that would
incorporate the whole world.

849
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:05,810
So the way I would do this,

850
00:52:05,811 --> 00:52:10,811
as Jesus was an apocalyptic Jewish prophet
who was executed because the Romans

851
00:52:11,301 --> 00:52:13,520
at least believed that he was,

852
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:16,880
he or his disciples were making dangerous
claims that he was the king of the

853
00:52:16,881 --> 00:52:21,440
Jews. That's all you get
on the historical Jesus.

854
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:25,100
Sorry.
Next time we start on Paul,

855
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:27,260
see you next time.
