1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,070
You're listening to radio
lab radio from WNYCC

2
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:11,550
and NPR one when you die,

3
00:00:11,551 --> 00:00:15,000
we can all agree on
this. Something changes.

4
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:19,910
You get the feeling that something
that was there isn't there or leaves.

5
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:24,400
But what leave one, two, three. Can
you hear me? We talked to a biologist,

6
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,390
a at Princeton University, Lee silver,

7
00:00:26,391 --> 00:00:31,160
who told us a story about a guy back
in 1907 who did a very interesting

8
00:00:31,161 --> 00:00:33,960
experiment. His name was Duncan
MacDougall. I don't know.

9
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,400
I don't remember exactly who he was.
Was he was he was a doctor. A doctor.

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,040
A physician, yes. And what's his story?

11
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:45,670
He wanted to prove that I'm
the sole exited the body after.

12
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:47,323
Yeah.

13
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,090
He thought the sole had a certain amount
of weight, that it was a substance.

14
00:00:54,091 --> 00:00:59,091
And so what he did was he had these people
who were dying from tuberculosis and

15
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,400
he, he, they were lying on
beds on this gigantic scale.

16
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,230
He literally put people almost
dying onto a under a scale. Yes.

17
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:11,410
So imagine how a patient on one side
of the scale and on the other side are

18
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,320
weights and they're,
they're in perfect balance.

19
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,580
And then at the moment of
death, right at the last breath,

20
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,570
he tried to determine whether
or not the scale changed.

21
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:31,060
So did they lose weight when they
died? That was the question. Right.

22
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:36,300
And he claimed that on
average they lost 21 grams.

23
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,780
The instant they died. Oh, did,

24
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:44,890
did it as he described the moment that
suddenly the scales shift one way or the

25
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:46,360
other? Yeah, the moment, I mean,

26
00:01:46,361 --> 00:01:50,040
death was easy in those days because
you stopped breathing. You were dead.

27
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,110
I mean, there were, there weren't you,
they weren't hooked into brain scans.

28
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,390
Right. So it's the, the last
breath. Oh, that's man. Yes. Um,

29
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:02,410
and the New York Times headline was,
so has weight physician thinks, right.

30
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:06,580
Great headline. Right? And this is
the beginning of the 20th century.

31
00:02:06,581 --> 00:02:08,910
We're not talking about
medieval times to remember that.

32
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:12,850
What did he conclude from
this soul has weight. Okay.

33
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,140
I seen a soul.

34
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,520
It was there when he was alive and it
flew off and it weighs 21 grams. Yes.

35
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:23,350
Now there was one person whose
weight didn't change immediately.

36
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,210
It changed a minute later.

37
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,580
And so his hypothesis was that this was
a very kind of dumb guy and the soul

38
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:36,690
was, didn't realize it was free. And
so it took a minute after the death,

39
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,660
before the soul realized it was
freeing. It flew out out of the body.

40
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,030
So at true idiot would be
hanging out like your for five

41
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,210
now. This was very
serious. Of course. Yeah.

42
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:53,300
How would you explain what he saw
or thought he saw the 21 grams?

43
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:55,940
I'm still stuck on that.
I mean 21 grams. It's,

44
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:59,040
it's statistically insignificant.

45
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:07,600
You mean three quarters of an ounce
compared to the weight of a body is a

46
00:03:07,601 --> 00:03:10,450
minuscule amount.
Particularly he says Lee,

47
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:13,210
when you consider how crude
the scales were at the time,

48
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:17,020
almost anything could have swayed
them. I'll breeze the pressure.

49
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:22,450
Anything really, uh, today, hey,
we'd be laughed out of the academy.

50
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:27,370
You ever seen someone die or ever seen
a dead person? I've seen dead people.

51
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:32,080
I mean, I've seen dead bodies.
[inaudible] I do. Do you, I mean, I,

52
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:35,630
I just want my mom just before she
died and just after she died. Yes.

53
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,220
And I thought to myself, um,

54
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,550
there's a real difference here. It's,

55
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,880
it's beyond power or it's a,

56
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:49,210
it's a very noticeable
deep absence of something.

57
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,830
And it does make you think that something,

58
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,720
I'll use the word carefully.
Vital has gone away. Suddenly

59
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:04,660
we have to be very careful about the
words. I mean, something has gone away.

60
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:09,661
The brain has ceased to function and
therefore I would say there is no person.

61
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:23,690
It's still the unanswered question is
what really happens in that moment when a

62
00:04:24,141 --> 00:04:25,400
person is suddenly

63
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,163
gone

64
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,070
to the other side, the other side,

65
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:36,260
those of us with the benefit of being
alive cannot help but ask this question.

66
00:04:36,261 --> 00:04:37,460
It's like a curse. We want to know,

67
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:41,870
but obviously it's not something you can
know because this will just always be

68
00:04:41,871 --> 00:04:45,320
one of those domains. What are the tools
of science just can't be used. Alas.

69
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,250
But then there are those folks like
neuroscientist, David Eagleman who say,

70
00:04:49,251 --> 00:04:50,540
screw it. We're going to ask.

71
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,640
We're going to wonder cause
that's just what we do.

72
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,090
When you walk to the end
of the pier of science,

73
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,970
you look out and you've
got everything beyond that.

74
00:04:58,971 --> 00:05:02,480
You've got the whole ocean of what we
don't know past the end of the pier.

75
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,740
What a scientist does is sort of leap
out onto different islands and just try

76
00:05:06,741 --> 00:05:11,570
things out. I'm Jab, I'm Rod and I'm
Robert Belviq. Today on radio lab,

77
00:05:11,571 --> 00:05:15,050
we're going to do what David Eagleman
suggests. We're just going to hop around.

78
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,030
This is unusual for us, but what the heck?

79
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,150
We're going to look at
different aspects of, yeah,

80
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:24,760
and the other side in no particular
order, but here's what we can tell you.

81
00:05:24,761 --> 00:05:27,700
We're going to make 11
stops, 11 meditations,

82
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:31,840
shall we call them on various questions
relating to death and dying and what

83
00:05:31,841 --> 00:05:32,674
happens after

84
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,800
won't be depressing. No, you just
heard the first one, so has wait.

85
00:05:38,801 --> 00:05:43,390
Physician thinks. Here's our second
[inaudible] comes to us from a,

86
00:05:43,391 --> 00:05:46,810
the guy you just heard David Eagleman
who is a neuroscientist but wrote a book

87
00:05:46,811 --> 00:05:51,700
called some. Yeah. Which is very
not neurosciencey at all. Truth is,

88
00:05:51,701 --> 00:05:55,780
I haven't talked about this book with
any of my science colleagues. Why not?

89
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,080
I have reasons why,
but I'm not sure I want

90
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,140
to say them on the radio. In any case,

91
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:04,220
the book consists of 40 different
versions of the afterlife and here's one,

92
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,520
it's called metamorphosis written by
David Eagleman and read by Jeffrey Tambor,

93
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:14,690
the Ecuador, right? There
are three depths. Now,

94
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:17,780
the first is when the body
ceases to function of course,

95
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:22,640
and the second is when the
body is consigned or you know,

96
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,283
put in the grave.

97
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:29,420
The third is that moment sometime in
the future when your name is spoken,

98
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,093
who the last time

99
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,500
[inaudible] [inaudible].

100
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,233
So

101
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,760
you wait in this lobby
until the third death

102
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:51,010
and there are long tables
with coffee and tea cookies.

103
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:52,030
You can help yourself in there.

104
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,820
There are people here from all around
the world and with a little effort,

105
00:06:54,821 --> 00:06:58,390
you can strike up some
convivial smalltalk.

106
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:04,530
Just be aware that your conversation
could be interrupted at any moment by a

107
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,630
while. We call them the Kohler

108
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,463
Thompson parents,

109
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,450
and what they do is they
broadcast your new friend's name

110
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:20,750
to indicate that they will never again
be another remembrance of him by anyone

111
00:07:21,851 --> 00:07:22,684
on the earth.

112
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:25,150
[inaudible]

113
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:29,920
your friend's slumps saddened. Even
though the callers, they tell him, kindly,

114
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,350
look, you're, you're, you're
off to a better place.

115
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:34,320
[inaudible]

116
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:34,771
the thing is,

117
00:07:34,771 --> 00:07:38,070
no one knows where that better place is
or what it offers because no one exiting

118
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:39,570
through that door is returned to tell us

119
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:42,970
[inaudible]

120
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:43,900
and tragically,

121
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:48,130
many people leave just as their loved
ones arrived since the loved ones,

122
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:52,420
we're the only ones doing the remembering
and we all wag our heads at that

123
00:07:52,421 --> 00:07:56,120
typical timing. Now,

124
00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:00,320
not everyone is sad when their callers
shout out their next list of names.

125
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:04,450
On the contrary, some people
bank and they, they plead to,

126
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,730
these are generally the guys
who've been here a long time.

127
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,230
Yeah, too long.

128
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,950
We take that farmer over there who
drowned in a small river 200 years ago.

129
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,361
I get this,

130
00:08:18,361 --> 00:08:22,680
his farm is the side of a small college
now and the tour guides each week tell

131
00:08:22,681 --> 00:08:25,200
his story. So he, he's, he's stuck.

132
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:32,040
He's, he's miserable. The
more his story is told,

133
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,680
the more the details drift.

134
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,930
He's utterly alienated from his name
and it's no longer identical with him,

135
00:08:39,931 --> 00:08:44,931
but it continues to bind and
that cheerless woman across
the way is praised as a

136
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,240
saint even though the roads in her
heart believed me were complicated.

137
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,040
And I guess that is the curse of this room

138
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,380
because since we live in the
heads of those who remember us,

139
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:07,370
we lose control of our lives
and become who they want us.

140
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:31,960
[inaudible] [inaudible]

141
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:35,440
what gave you the idea for that
story? This actually, I should say,

142
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:41,710
came out of my work as a neuroscientist
because what happens in the brain is you

143
00:09:41,711 --> 00:09:44,590
make models of other people
when you think, well,

144
00:09:44,591 --> 00:09:47,200
what would my friends such and such
say, or what would my wife say?

145
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,860
You're actually running a little
simulation of that person in your head.

146
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:52,841
Well,

147
00:09:52,841 --> 00:09:57,841
what happens when somebody dies is that
they exist only in the scattered heads

148
00:09:58,121 --> 00:10:00,160
around the globe of people who knew them.

149
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:03,940
They exist in some way as these
algorithms that continue to run,

150
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:09,490
but through time you, your
model of somebody might drift.

151
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,200
[inaudible] are we ready?

152
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,450
[inaudible] a number three. I'm going
to change up the question a bit.

153
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,950
When am I dead?

154
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,800
How do you decide if
somebody is alive or dead?

155
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:34,900
If you take it as your starting
point? King Lear Shakespeare,

156
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,770
when Cordelia, his daughter died

157
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,370
[inaudible] takes out
a mirror looking glass,

158
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,220
puts it right under her nose to
see if there is some breadth there.

159
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:52,090
Is that that breath well missed or
staying the CT set of fitness feather.

160
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:53,803
Just the same thing.

161
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:58,590
And that is how he decides
if she's on or off.

162
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,980
Yes, and it's really one of the most
beautiful scenes in Shakespeare.

163
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:05,160
That's Gary Greenberg. He wrote
a book called the noble lie.

164
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,980
When it's done right, it's
impossible not to weep.

165
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:11,450
She has gone farther at that scene

166
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,650
and the intimacy of that moment.

167
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:23,220
But if you fast forward a few
hundred years, things change.

168
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,700
All right? It's 18, 16.

169
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:31,010
There's a fat lady in a hospital where
in France and in walks a guy by the,

170
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,750
what was his name? Do you
have few Cleon sheath? Yeah.

171
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,610
Mac lantack. Yeah, he's a doctor.
He's a dusk fellow. Okay. Yes.

172
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:45,210
And he is called in to consult with, uh,

173
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:49,850
a patient who is obese, obese, and
ill. He says to this lady, please,

174
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,010
may I see your wrist. So
said, I can feel your pulse.

175
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:54,130
But this woman had so much flesh on

176
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:58,720
her that the only way he could imagine
to do it was to put his ear on her chest,

177
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,330
which would have been in decent.

178
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,500
Mm. So came up with an idea.

179
00:12:05,501 --> 00:12:08,110
He fabricated quite quickly.

180
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:12,790
A device rolled up paper really
and fashioned it into a tube,

181
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:18,070
put one into the tube on the woman's
chest and his year on the other end. Oh,

182
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,920
how very decent of him. So he
doesn't have to touch her flesh.

183
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,800
He doesn't have to even
really look at her chest.

184
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,470
His head is actually turned
away from the patient.

185
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:33,630
And so what we've got here in 1816
is the world's first stethoscope.

186
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:40,500
And a very unintimidating increasingly
precise and technological approach to

187
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:44,890
defining death, which now is all
about the heart. Up until then,

188
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:49,000
a death was heart death. People are
dead when their heart stops speeding.

189
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,100
But if you fast forward again,

190
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:54,580
things take another term like
just imagine thought experiment.

191
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:59,770
If King Lear had been
written not in 1604 but 1968

192
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:01,883
[inaudible]

193
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,640
LBJ administration. Okay.
Cordelia with [inaudible]

194
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:06,950
[inaudible]

195
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:10,040
there would be distraught but instead
of doing the mirror thing again,

196
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:13,520
he would call a doctor who would rush
her to the hospital, shock her heart,

197
00:13:13,521 --> 00:13:16,640
resuscitate her, hook her up to
a ventilator and a feeding tube.

198
00:13:16,641 --> 00:13:19,490
And there she would be alive again.

199
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:25,130
Sort of. I mean technically, yes, she'd
be alive cause her heart would be,

200
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,450
but the core Delia that he knew
his daughter would be gone.

201
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:39,460
[inaudible] [inaudible] Mama

202
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:46,680
[inaudible] [inaudible]

203
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,770
and this was the problem in 1968
with all this new technology,

204
00:13:49,771 --> 00:13:54,771
ICU units were filling up with these
purgatorial Cordelia's who floated

205
00:13:55,531 --> 00:13:59,070
somewhere in a comatose
state between life and death.

206
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,320
You could minister to these
people, you could feed them,

207
00:14:01,321 --> 00:14:05,280
you could clear their infections. But you
could not restore their consciousness.

208
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,440
What are you going to do with
these people? In walks a physician,

209
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:14,440
a very prominent American
physician named Henry Beecher,

210
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:17,800
and he decided that the time he'd
come to acknowledge the obvious,

211
00:14:17,801 --> 00:14:21,310
which to him was these people
weren't just dying, they were dead.

212
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:26,670
He convened a committee at Harvard and
he simply moved the line that divides

213
00:14:27,731 --> 00:14:31,990
life from death back a little bit toward
what most people would consider life.

214
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:36,790
And so you get in that moment, the concept
of brain death person is really dead.

215
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,430
We really did not, when
they stopped breathing,

216
00:14:39,431 --> 00:14:43,300
not when their heart stops beating,
but when their brain winks out,

217
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,790
that now is when a person
really dies. Exactly.

218
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,720
Totally invented concept, but it stuck.

219
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:54,750
One way to argue it that the brain was
considered to be sort of the Maestro,

220
00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:00,220
the coordinating Oregon that made all
of the rest of the body work and without

221
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:03,560
it, the center no longer
holds and things fall apart.

222
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,720
And nowadays most people go with
this brain dead definition of death,

223
00:15:08,721 --> 00:15:10,940
but where it gets weird is
it? There are some [inaudible]

224
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,730
just a few. For instance,

225
00:15:14,731 --> 00:15:18,660
some sex of Orthodox Judaism will
say that if the heart is beating,

226
00:15:18,661 --> 00:15:20,040
the lungs are still filling with Aaron.

227
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,260
If the lungs are still feeling
like they're still a soul,

228
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:27,330
the spirit of God is in you and you
certainly can't be said to be dead. Well,

229
00:15:27,331 --> 00:15:29,280
I'll give you another
example. That's John Troyer,

230
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,790
associate of death and dying practices
at the University of bath. For example,

231
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:37,680
Italy, they use the brain death criteria.
The Vatican, however its own city,

232
00:15:37,681 --> 00:15:40,410
state within the country
of Italy does not.

233
00:15:40,411 --> 00:15:44,550
The Vatican goes only by heart death.
So technically according to John,

234
00:15:44,551 --> 00:15:48,180
it's possible that if I were brain-dead
in Italy and doctor wanted to pull my

235
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:49,410
plug but my family didn't,

236
00:15:49,411 --> 00:15:53,760
they could just wheel me down the
street into the Vatican and I'd be alive

237
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:54,630
again.

238
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:57,180
Yeah, I mean you'd need a really
long extension cord probably.

239
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:58,643
Cause of course these are all,

240
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,590
I mean you'd be on machines
and devices that require power.

241
00:16:01,591 --> 00:16:05,820
So I mean it would be a laborious
process to say the least. Nonetheless,

242
00:16:05,821 --> 00:16:07,620
the real question here, the deeper one,

243
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:11,020
is it, when do you die?
Is it brain versus heart?

244
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,750
It's when are you gone?

245
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:18,250
Like when is a father a son, a daughter

246
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:24,100
really gone to us and who gets to
decide that? And that's there in lies.

247
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:29,550
The rub dead to family can be very
different than dead to an institution that

248
00:16:31,001 --> 00:16:32,010
might be caring for that body.

249
00:16:32,011 --> 00:16:37,000
You know that that scene of leader
with the mirror is in the feathers.

250
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,910
It's not a medical diagnosis.

251
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,290
It's a diagnosis about
love and lungs. Ooh,

252
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,970
stay a little.

253
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,590
And number four, tennis. Anyone.
Let me tell you about a woman.

254
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:07,730
She was the victim of a
road traffic accident,

255
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:12,060
but that's Dr Adrian Owen.
He's a neuroscientist at
the University of Cambridge.

256
00:17:12,061 --> 00:17:14,550
And he told me about this patient. He had

257
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:19,560
a patient who's in her thirties and
she came to us after five months in a

258
00:17:21,281 --> 00:17:23,770
vegetative state following
a blow to her head.

259
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,930
So for five months she'd
been lying in the hospital,

260
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,280
couldn't talk or couldn't
move. He could breathe,

261
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:32,240
but no evidence of any awareness would

262
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,320
shine light in her eyes.

263
00:17:33,321 --> 00:17:37,010
She wouldn't have the normal response
in the fact that woman was gone.

264
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,873
That's right.

265
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:44,090
But in spite of the fact that she
was giving the world nothing back,

266
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,100
Dr. Owen wondered, would it just be
possible that there was somebody in there

267
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,483
[inaudible]

268
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:57,870
so we tried a new kind of
approach with her. Yeah.

269
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:02,280
Because they had a new and sophisticated
tool that previous scientists,

270
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:05,790
I never had any rain scanner. Yeah.
This is a stethoscope for the brain.

271
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,970
Dr. Owens stood by her bedside
and said, tell you what,

272
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:13,170
in a few minutes we're going to take
you to a machine. You chat with her.

273
00:18:13,171 --> 00:18:14,004
You say, hey,

274
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,450
that's exactly how it's
done. Yes, it sounds, um,

275
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:19,910
a little bit bizarre because of course
you don't get any responses back from

276
00:18:19,911 --> 00:18:23,450
these patients. You don't
even know whether they can
hear you, but we, you know,

277
00:18:23,451 --> 00:18:25,030
we might instructions very clear. Yeah.

278
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,380
And he says, now when we
put you in the machine,

279
00:18:27,381 --> 00:18:31,670
there's going to be a click and I'm
going to say into your ear, please begin

280
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,010
to imagine playing a
vigorous game of tennis.

281
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:37,920
What

282
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,460
we said,

283
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:42,480
imagine that you're standing there at
the baseline Wimbledon carrying out the

284
00:18:42,481 --> 00:18:43,314
movements.

285
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,990
Dennis. See because here's the thing,

286
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:49,690
we now know enough about brains to know
that if you are imagining tennis, yeah.

287
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,970
Well, produce activity
in your motor cortex.

288
00:18:51,971 --> 00:18:55,360
Very similar to the activity that you
would see if you could scan somebody when

289
00:18:55,361 --> 00:18:56,830
they were actually
playing a game of tennis.

290
00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:00,290
And this is true of all healthy people.
That's right. Oh, it's the same pattern.

291
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:00,680
Yeah.

292
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,330
It lights up very reliably.

293
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:06,180
Okay, so he taped puts this patient into
a brain scan and he rolls her into the

294
00:19:06,181 --> 00:19:07,014
machine.

295
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:11,610
When we say right, play tennis, now relax,

296
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,810
play tennis. Now relax.

297
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:18,510
And you said this woman's been
vacant for five months. Yeah,

298
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:23,730
I get to see this seems quite literally
a shot or a forehand in the dark.

299
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:28,400
This was his first patient. Really?
He does this. He says, play,

300
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,360
stop, play, stop.

301
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:36,080
She hadn't spoken or showing any sense
of awareness or any interior life at all

302
00:19:36,081 --> 00:19:38,410
for months and months
and months and months and

303
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:44,150
tennis on the screen.
Here's a tennis game.

304
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,303
[inaudible]

305
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,360
what we saw is exactly what
we see in healthy volunteers.

306
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:00,700
No premotor cortex is turning on and
turning off. When we asked her to relax,

307
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,373
turning on

308
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,540
when we asked her to do the task

309
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,310
and it would stop when
we asked her to relax.

310
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:16,060
So she's in there, she's in there. Oh,

311
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:20,800
were you amazed or were you,
uh, expected? What will you,

312
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,090
what happened to you?

313
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:26,640
Um, well, yeah, I mean, it, it was,

314
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,140
it was pretty exciting.

315
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:32,310
I'm going to have to say the fact that
it was the first person who tried it in

316
00:20:32,311 --> 00:20:34,170
with was perhaps the biggest surprise.

317
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:39,150
And we've scanned about 20 patients since
then doing the same thing. And we've,

318
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:43,680
we've seen three so far who,
uh, showed clear signs of, uh,

319
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,580
of being aware.

320
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,680
See, that's the thing that sort
of frightens me about you've done,

321
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:52,710
it seems to me you've discovered that
there may have been and there may be lots

322
00:20:55,121 --> 00:21:00,121
of people in this world who are somehow
aware but who are invisible to the rest

323
00:21:02,711 --> 00:21:03,430
of us,

324
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:08,110
whom we could in effect
murder it by mistake.

325
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:15,770
Yeah. Well, that's obviously
very, um, loaded question.

326
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,590
Uh, I mean I think we, you know,

327
00:21:18,591 --> 00:21:23,591
we have to face the side that historically
we haven't always had the tools that

328
00:21:25,821 --> 00:21:30,110
we have today that can help us
to make a complex decisions.

329
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:33,010
But we're very early stages
of this and they're awesome.

330
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:38,310
Some also very technical reasons why
one needs to be extremely cautious about

331
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,790
drawing conclusions from
this. For example, you know,

332
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:48,710
we could tell with this patient that
she was aware and what we can't do is to

333
00:21:48,711 --> 00:21:52,040
conclude that the rest of
them were definitely unaware.

334
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:55,870
[inaudible]

335
00:21:55,870 --> 00:22:00,870
imagine if you were stone deaf and you
appear to be in a vegetative state.

336
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,760
Now in that situation,

337
00:22:03,761 --> 00:22:06,720
we wouldn't necessarily know that
you were stone deaf because you've,

338
00:22:06,721 --> 00:22:10,180
you've had a major brain injury and
we can't talk to you and find out.

339
00:22:10,181 --> 00:22:12,090
So we don't know that you're stone deaf.

340
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,010
We put you in the scan and we asked
you to imagine playing tennis,

341
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:17,880
but you can't even hear
the instructions. Actually,

342
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:20,740
that patient wouldn't
imagine playing tennis.

343
00:22:20,741 --> 00:22:22,840
They wouldn't activate
their premotor cortex.

344
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:27,010
But it wouldn't be because they weren't
aware it would be because they were

345
00:22:27,011 --> 00:22:27,640
deaf.

346
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,540
Oh dear.

347
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,950
So even though we can tell
when a patient is aware,

348
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:37,900
we can't tell when a patient
is unaware. And that's very,

349
00:22:37,901 --> 00:22:39,190
very important distinction.

350
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,860
But if you can't really know
that someone is unaware,

351
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,980
and then you can't actually ever
really know if they're gone.
