00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.389
The illustration below shows the
graph of y as a function of x.

00:00:04.389 --> 00:00:05.930
So that's this graph
right over here.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.805
And then they start to
ask us some questions.

00:00:07.805 --> 00:00:10.550
Complete the sentences based
on the graph of the function.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.870
So this axis is our
y-axis, the vertical axis.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.900
Horizontal axis is x-axis.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.710
Initially, as x increases--
so let's think about it.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.710
Initially, so when we start from
x equals 0 and x is increasing,

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.160
what's happening to y?

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.920
Well, y is decreasing.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.820
So y decreases.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.270
So as x increases
initially, y decreases.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.920
The slope of the graph is equal
to blank for all x between

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.690
x equals 0 and x equals 3.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.950
So x equals 0 and x equals
3, what's the slope?

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.050
Well, every time we move
1 in the x direction,

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.900
we move down in the y direction.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.510
We go negative 1
in the y direction.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.420
Move up 1 in the x
direction, we go negative 1

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.290
in the y direction.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.730
So our change in y over our
change in x-- our change in y

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.440
is negative 1 whenever
our change in x is 1.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.320
So our change in
y over our change

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.970
in x, which is the definition
of slope, is negative 1/1.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.573
So it's negative 1.

00:01:03.573 --> 00:01:04.239
And we see that.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.030
Every time x increases
by 1, y decreases by 1.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.990
Starting at x equals 3,
y blank as x increases.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.000
So starting at x equals 3,
y increases as x increases.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.680
As x increases, y is increasing.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.560
So y increases as x increases.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.830
The slope of the graph is equal
to blank for x between 3 and 5.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.920
So when x increases by
1, y is increasing by 3.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.560
So change in y is
3, change in x is 1.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.600
Slope is change in y over
change in x, which is 3/1.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.270
So the slope here is 3.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.880
Every time x increases
by 1, y increases by 3.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.310
For x between x equals 0 and
x equals 4, y-- let's see,

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.750
we can pick less than or equal
to, greater than or equal to,

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.070
or equal.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.450
So for x equals
0 and x equals 4,

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.562
y is less than or equal to 0.

00:02:07.562 --> 00:02:09.990
So let's do less
than or equal to 0.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.450
And then they say,
for x between x

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.630
equals 4 and x
equals 8-- well, then

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.370
y is greater than or equal to 0.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.800
So let's make sure
that we didn't

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.133
make any careless mistakes here.

00:02:20.133 --> 00:02:21.480
Let's check our answer.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.450
We got it right.
