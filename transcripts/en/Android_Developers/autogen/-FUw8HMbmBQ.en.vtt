episode we are looking at the hierarchy

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900
episode we are looking at the hierarchy
 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.810
episode we are looking at the hierarchy
viewer and how you can use that tool to

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820
viewer and how you can use that tool to
 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.570
viewer and how you can use that tool to
help you optimize your layouts and views

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580
help you optimize your layouts and views
 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.519
help you optimize your layouts and views
in your application and we're going to

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529
in your application and we're going to
 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.830
in your application and we're going to
be using the bacon reader sample

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840
be using the bacon reader sample
 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.090
be using the bacon reader sample
application again that you've seen in

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100
application again that you've seen in
 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.950
application again that you've seen in
one of the other devbytes before let's

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960
one of the other devbytes before let's
 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.420
one of the other devbytes before let's
have a look at our hierarchy viewer

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430
have a look at our hierarchy viewer
 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.410
have a look at our hierarchy viewer
again because I noticed there's

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420
again because I noticed there's
 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.150
again because I noticed there's
something strange going on in one of our

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160
something strange going on in one of our
 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.630
something strange going on in one of our
layouts so we have our main article view

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640
layouts so we have our main article view
 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.760
layouts so we have our main article view
where we have some text we have a title

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770
where we have some text we have a title
 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.139
where we have some text we have a title
and we have a background picture in any

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149
and we have a background picture in any
 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.880
and we have a background picture in any
of our main body of text here this is

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890
of our main body of text here this is
 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.799
of our main body of text here this is
happening here and top in the top of the

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809
happening here and top in the top of the
 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.459
happening here and top in the top of the
column you um and our hierarchy looks

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469
column you um and our hierarchy looks
 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.500
column you um and our hierarchy looks
very very complicated if a relative

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510
very very complicated if a relative
 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.970
very very complicated if a relative
layout and then we have a frame layout

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980
layout and then we have a frame layout
 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.010
layout and then we have a frame layout
and then we have an image for you and

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020
and then we have an image for you and
 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.360
and then we have an image for you and
then have some text views down here so

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370
then have some text views down here so
 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.580
then have some text views down here so
we can definitely simplify that and each

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590
we can definitely simplify that and each
 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.779
we can definitely simplify that and each
of these steps in our layer adds extra

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789
of these steps in our layer adds extra
 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.010
of these steps in our layer adds extra
time that's needed to measure and draw

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020
time that's needed to measure and draw
 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.470
time that's needed to measure and draw
everything to the screen so if you go to

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480
everything to the screen so if you go to
 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.750
everything to the screen so if you go to
our layout here so this is where we're

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760
our layout here so this is where we're
 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.740
our layout here so this is where we're
defining what the image and what the

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750
defining what the image and what the
 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.260
defining what the image and what the
tiser looks like so this is very very

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270
tiser looks like so this is very very
 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.340
tiser looks like so this is very very
confusing you have a relative layout

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350
confusing you have a relative layout
 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.620
confusing you have a relative layout
here frame layout linear layout let's

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630
here frame layout linear layout let's
 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.850
here frame layout linear layout let's
simplify this so the way this is

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860
simplify this so the way this is
 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.390
simplify this so the way this is
structured is that we have an image view

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400
structured is that we have an image view
 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.490
structured is that we have an image view
that has our main the big picture in

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500
that has our main the big picture in
 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.230
that has our main the big picture in
half in the background and then we have

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240
half in the background and then we have
 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.109
half in the background and then we have
this this gradient on top of that and

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119
this this gradient on top of that and
 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.359
this this gradient on top of that and
then we have our title and then a

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369
then we have our title and then a
 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.109
then we have our title and then a
smaller subtitle as well as subheading

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119
smaller subtitle as well as subheading
 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.760
smaller subtitle as well as subheading
let's simplify this a lot what we can do

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770
let's simplify this a lot what we can do
 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.890
let's simplify this a lot what we can do
is we can simply have the image view you

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900
is we can simply have the image view you
 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.630
is we can simply have the image view you
know the big picture and then we can

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640
know the big picture and then we can
 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.340
know the big picture and then we can
just use one simple view on top you can

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350
just use one simple view on top you can
 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.530
just use one simple view on top you can
use a text view on top and the text ream

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540
use a text view on top and the text ream
 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.539
use a text view on top and the text ream
you can specify the background as the

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549
you can specify the background as the
 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.460
you can specify the background as the
gradient that we have I think it's sadly

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470
gradient that we have I think it's sadly
 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.550
gradient that we have I think it's sadly
the the gravity of our text you to

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560
the the gravity of our text you to
 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.410
the the gravity of our text you to
bottom which means which means that the

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420
bottom which means which means that the
 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.230
bottom which means which means that the
text that we put inside the title is

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240
text that we put inside the title is
 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.120
text that we put inside the title is
drawn at the bottom of the bottom of the

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130
drawn at the bottom of the bottom of the
 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.980
drawn at the bottom of the bottom of the
image this is all we have done here

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990
image this is all we have done here
 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.219
image this is all we have done here
speaking of a place all of this the

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229
speaking of a place all of this the
 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.539
speaking of a place all of this the
values of layouts you lay everything out

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549
values of layouts you lay everything out
 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.819
values of layouts you lay everything out
this simple frame layout if you have an

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829
this simple frame layout if you have an
 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.560
this simple frame layout if you have an
image for you and get the text view on

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570
image for you and get the text view on
 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.749
image for you and get the text view on
top and the text view contains the

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759
top and the text view contains the
 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.510
top and the text view contains the
background and the entire text but you

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520
background and the entire text but you
 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.039
background and the entire text but you
are saying look

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049
are saying look
 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:16.979
are saying look
we this title this headline actually

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989
we this title this headline actually
 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.119
we this title this headline actually
contains two different or three

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129
contains two different or three
 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.250
contains two different or three
different types of textiles we have our

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260
different types of textiles we have our
 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.020
different types of textiles we have our
main headline and there's some smaller

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030
main headline and there's some smaller
 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.780
main headline and there's some smaller
text down below to do that you have to

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790
text down below to do that you have to
 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.170
text down below to do that you have to
use text appearance spanner bolts and if

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180
use text appearance spanner bolts and if
 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.610
use text appearance spanner bolts and if
you have one simple text view but you

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620
you have one simple text view but you
 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.800
you have one simple text view but you
can set you can style the you can study

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810
can set you can style the you can study
 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.599
can set you can style the you can study
from parts or if you text you

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:33.609
from parts or if you text you
 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:36.240
from parts or if you text you
differently so here we have these text

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250
differently so here we have these text
 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.550
differently so here we have these text
appearance span objects and you're

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560
appearance span objects and you're
 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.860
appearance span objects and you're
loading each of them in with a different

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870
loading each of them in with a different
 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.050
loading each of them in with a different
texture parent star that we have defined

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060
texture parent star that we have defined
 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.449
texture parent star that we have defined
in XML that's a normal just a normal

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459
in XML that's a normal just a normal
 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.140
in XML that's a normal just a normal
style the loading this in and then then

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150
style the loading this in and then then
 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.080
style the loading this in and then then
we set up the the views that we set the

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090
we set up the the views that we set the
 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.420
we set up the the views that we set the
title this is where we are saying they

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430
title this is where we are saying they
 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.819
title this is where we are saying they
were loading in this is where we're

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829
were loading in this is where we're
 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:04.199
were loading in this is where we're
loading the the text here to be using

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209
loading the the text here to be using
 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.149
loading the the text here to be using
expendable string to do to do this an

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:06.159
expendable string to do to do this an
 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:07.770
expendable string to do to do this an
expendable string allows you to set a

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780
expendable string allows you to set a
 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.539
expendable string allows you to set a
text and then you can aspire then again

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549
text and then you can aspire then again
 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:11.309
text and then you can aspire then again
you can apply different spanner bolts

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319
you can apply different spanner bolts
 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.440
you can apply different spanner bolts
for parts of the text so in our case

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450
for parts of the text so in our case
 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.929
for parts of the text so in our case
here the first thing we do is we compile

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:15.939
here the first thing we do is we compile
 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:17.640
here the first thing we do is we compile
our text you want to display cream

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650
our text you want to display cream
 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.219
our text you want to display cream
newline characters and then we apply

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:20.229
newline characters and then we apply
 

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:21.780
newline characters and then we apply
each of the different text appearances

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790
each of the different text appearances
 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.229
each of the different text appearances
to a part of this to a part of this of

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239
to a part of this to a part of this of
 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.149
to a part of this to a part of this of
the string in this case here we have the

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:27.159
the string in this case here we have the
 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:29.189
the string in this case here we have the
title appearance we have the by text

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:29.199
title appearance we have the by text
 

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:31.199
title appearance we have the by text
underneath that and then we have the

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209
underneath that and then we have the
 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.479
underneath that and then we have the
author appearance as well and we

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489
author appearance as well and we
 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.099
author appearance as well and we
basically to specify the start and end

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109
basically to specify the start and end
 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:37.469
basically to specify the start and end
characters the normal character count so

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:37.479
characters the normal character count so
 

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:40.110
characters the normal character count so
once we've done that we basically set

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120
once we've done that we basically set
 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:47.039
once we've done that we basically set
the set the spendable string to our to

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049
the set the spendable string to our to
 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.170
the set the spendable string to our to
our text view using the expandable

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180
our text view using the expandable
 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.030
our text view using the expandable
buffer type so it gets applied properly

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040
buffer type so it gets applied properly
 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.009
buffer type so it gets applied properly
you keep our settings modes method and

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019
you keep our settings modes method and
 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.780
you keep our settings modes method and
we can remove our you can remove our old

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790
we can remove our you can remove our old
 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.749
we can remove our you can remove our old
way of ever setting the title and if you

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:00.759
way of ever setting the title and if you
 

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:02.610
way of ever setting the title and if you
start our application again you will see

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620
start our application again you will see
 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.349
start our application again you will see
that it basically looks exactly the same

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359
that it basically looks exactly the same
 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:07.229
that it basically looks exactly the same
but we have much much fewer views than

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239
but we have much much fewer views than
 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.839
but we have much much fewer views than
what we had before simply by using a by

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849
what we had before simply by using a by
 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.369
what we had before simply by using a by
using text appearance panels and

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:11.379
using text appearance panels and
 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:13.080
using text appearance panels and
combining them together into one single

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090
combining them together into one single
 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.869
combining them together into one single
text view so let's see what it looks

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:15.879
text view so let's see what it looks
 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:17.370
text view so let's see what it looks
like here and as you can see it looks

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380
like here and as you can see it looks
 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.960
like here and as you can see it looks
basically identical to what we had

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970
basically identical to what we had
 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.180
basically identical to what we had
before but our layout hierarchy is much

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190
before but our layout hierarchy is much
 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.909
before but our layout hierarchy is much
much simpler so I really hope you're

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919
much simpler so I really hope you're
 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:25.230
much simpler so I really hope you're
going to try out our give your your own

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240
going to try out our give your your own
 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.030
going to try out our give your your own
application and see what it looks like

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040
application and see what it looks like
 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.590
application and see what it looks like
and how you can optimize the application

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600
and how you can optimize the application
 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.830
and how you can optimize the application
to make it perform much much better
