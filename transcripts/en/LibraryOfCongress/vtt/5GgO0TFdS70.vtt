&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.670 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: For Dr.
Carla Hayden, Librarian of Congress.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:19.010
Each book is a story each story
is made of glistening letters

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.500
and letters the ones
grandmother wrote

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.860
in late night singing each song
is a long comin' home journey

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:35.070
that was written in the first
ever morning when we walked

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.860
into freedom each freedom climbs
the mountain where you stand

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:48.060
and remember all the ones that
stood up with faces painted

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:54.690
by a million suns triumphant
voices ushered

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:02.690
by a marching new dawn written
writing and walking giving

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:11.330
and giving each dawn again
and again giving books

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:18.190
of courageous love There it is.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.490
[Laughter]

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.640
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
