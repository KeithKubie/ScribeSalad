00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:13.710
Although 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.490
Medieval Britons weren’t exactly the cleanest
lot by modern standards (though contrary to

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.680
popular belief, despite some well-known exceptions,
they did, in general, bathe in some form or

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.400
another relatively regularly), the idea of
them just dropping trou and dumping half a

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.940
pound of fecal matter into the street below
isn’t exactly a fair or representative image.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.399
In fact, while Medieval Britons weren’t
yet aware of how festering feces contributed

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.510
to disease epidemics, they did know that it
smelled really, really bad and, eventually,

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.089
there was even some thought that said stinky
fumes caused the spread of disease; thus,

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:52.889
they made efforts to ensure the offending
odors were kept as far away from their homes

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:53.889
as possible.

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:58.479
Now, to be clear, generalizing about what
a large and diverse group of people did over

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:04.530
a millennium time span is extremely dodgy
business, and we’re not saying that some

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.450
Medieval Britons didn’t sometimes toss their
solid waste out the window.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.090
(After-all, laws against doing just that,
which we’ll talk about shortly, didn’t

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.729
come from nowhere; and there certainly are
many documented accounts of people doing this

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.829
in said massive time-span, though you’ll
note that many of said documented instances

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:26.799
describe liquid, rather than solid waste.)

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:31.679
We’re simply saying that the documented
evidence at hand seems to indicate it was

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:37.260
nowhere near as commonplace in Britain as
pop culture would have you believe.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.740
To begin with, particularly in the age when
one-story buildings were the norm, tossing

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.920
your own stink out the window meant you’d
have to smell it any time you chose to open

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.530
said window- not a recipe for a good time
in the summer, particularly, but also just

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.609
a recipe for a crappy time whenever you chose
to step out your door…

00:01:55.609 --> 00:02:01.549
There your poop would be, staring you in the
face, perhaps kept company by your neighbors’

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:03.130
latest expulsion.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.860
Needless to say, even without laws against
such a thing, it’s not surprising that defecating

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.100
out the window doesn’t seem to have been
most people’s go-to location to dump their

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.380
latest dump.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.050
That said, as multi-storied abodes began to
pop up, residents of some of the higher homes

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.130
occasionally do seem to have not been quite
so discerning about keeping things fresh for

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.990
the residents beneath them.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.100
Presumably, this played a role in laws being
passed against tossing one’s own excrement

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.190
out the window.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.390
On that note, in most major cities in England,
fines could and would be levied against citizens

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.190
who created a stink – either metaphorically
or literally – that inconvenienced their

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.190
neighbours.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.070
For example, in the early 14th century, tossing
anything out your window into the streets

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.260
of London, whether human waste or just any
sort of garbage, could see you fined 40p,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:01.720
which is difficult to translate to modern
values accurately, but is (very) roughly equivalent

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.830
to £108 or $142.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.040
And one couldn’t just hope that nobody would
notice if you tried tossing your waste out

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.040
the window.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.930
Ultimately muckrakers and surveyors of the
pavement were employed to make sure the thoroughfares

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.040
stayed relatively clean, including disposing
of any waste found in the streets (particularly

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.450
needed owing to the thousands of horses and
other animals tromping around major cities).

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.980
Needless to say, while you could have mostly
gotten away with emptying a chamber pot full

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:27.980
of urine out your window (so long as neighbors
weren’t complaining, there would be little

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.260
stopping you), doing the same with solid waste
would have likely meant you were going to

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.560
get caught, even if you were a bit clever
about the whole thing.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.540
On that latter point, the 14th century London
Assize of Nuisance (recording various disputes

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.000
between individuals and their neighbors) tells
of a Londoner called Alice Wade getting into

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.460
trouble for rigging a pipe to her indoor latrine
that washed her bodily expulsions into a nearby

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:54.540
gutter that in turn was used to, essentially,
flush a nearby latrine.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.060
Seems reasonable enough- her solid and liquid
waste goes into the gutter which in turn drains

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.170
into a place people do their necessaries in
anyway; no need for her to have to manually

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.470
carry her waste out of the home like a plebeian.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.150
This woman was a problem solver.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.300
Unfortunately for her, things didn’t quite
go as planned on the solid-waste side of things.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.300
To wit:

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.660
whereas of old in the par. of St. Michael
Queenhithe, a gutter running under certain

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.800
of the houses was provided to receive the
rainwater and other water draining from the

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.930
houses, gutters and street, so that the flow
might cleanse the privy on the Hithe, Alice

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.970
Wade has made a wooden pipe connecting the
seat of the privy in her solar with the gutter,

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.290
which is frequently stopped up by the filth
therefrom, and the neighbours under whose

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.900
houses the gutter runs are greatly inconvenienced
by the stench.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.670
Judgment that she remove the pipe within 40
days etc.

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:52.790
(And now, let us all pause and reflect on
the fact that some seven centuries after the

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:57.760
fact, we just had good reason to dig up and
discuss the record of a woman’s ingenious

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:04.010
defecating habits, with this stinky knowledge
very likely being the only thing history will

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.510
ever remember about the unique individual
that was Alice Wade…)

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.520
In any event, in cases where a perpetrator
could not be found, fines would be levied

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.810
against all homes immediately surrounding
smelly waste lying in the streets.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.880
As you can imagine, people didn’t often
take kindly to being fined for someone else’s

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.210
laziness and there’s at least one recorded
example of a man being kicked half to death

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.420
by his neighbours for throwing smoked fish
skin out of his window onto the street; we

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:36.370
can only imagine what they’d have done if
he’d added his own fishy excrement to the

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:37.800
tossed out mix.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.090
Thus, with the ever-present threat of mob
justice and harsh fines, sticking your butt

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:48.090
out of a window and squeezing out a stink-bomb
onto the masses below, as freeing as it might

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:52.040
have felt, just wasn’t worth it, particularly
when Britons had better (at least in terms

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.730
of the “out of sight, out of mind” factor)
means of waste disposal at their, well, disposal.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:00.760
So where did all the poop from populated regions
go in an age before massive sewer systems

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.260
and ubiquitous indoor plumbing?

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.640
In short, rivers and fields.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:11.389
In houses where they had no indoor plumbing
to speak of, Britons would usually do their

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:16.990
business in a bucket or chamber pot, which
would either be dumped directly into a river,

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:21.710
or a gutter designed to transport said waste
to the river- the hope being that when the

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:27.870
rain fell, it would wash the poop away to
its new, underwater home; out of sight, out

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:28.990
of mind.

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:33.110
In more affluent homes that had rudimentary
plumbing, the two p’s would make their way

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:38.740
to either a private or communal cesspit, often
buried underground to reduce the smell.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:43.370
These cesspits, or gongs as they were known
(from the Old English “gang”, meaning

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:48.580
“to go”), were designed such that the
liquid waste would be absorbed into the surrounding

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:53.889
soil (occasionally conveniently located near
public wells…) while the solid waste would

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:56.270
accumulate over a period of many months.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:01.090
Ultimately, these then needed to be emptied
by hand- a job commonly performed by individuals

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.080
known as “gong farmers”.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:08.330
Perhaps unsurprisingly given their profession,
gong farmers were exceptionally well-paid,

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:13.770
sometimes earning in a day what most labourers
earned in a week, and in times of plague potentially

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:14.830
even more.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:18.790
They also infrequently found valuables amongst
the waste that they were free to keep, though

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:24.020
it’s noted that they also occasionally found
skeletons from murder victims and unwanted

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.020
babies.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.020
So, yeah…

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.740
The job wasn’t without its risks.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:32.290
Besides the obvious disease risk-factor that
accompanies hopping into a pit of poop and

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:37.320
shoveling it out, the fumes could sometimes
cause a gong farmer to faint in the muck,

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.660
or they might otherwise just fall into a gong
too deep to stand in.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:45.139
(As an example of how big some of these pits
could be, there is record of it taking 13

00:07:45.139 --> 00:07:49.830
men five full nights to empty out a privy
at Newgate Gaol in 1281.)

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:55.100
We also know that because some privies designed
with the gongs directly beneath were not emptied

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.860
frequently enough, the floorboards above could
become saturated.

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:03.729
As a result, the boards sometimes collapsed,
occasionally resulting in deaths via drowning

00:08:03.729 --> 00:08:04.900
in waste.

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:11.410
(While technically one should float quite
easily in such a scenario, we can only imagine

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:14.800
said individuals struggling to get their heads
above the filth after falling in may have

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:15.870
had some suctioning effects pulling them under
in their panic… or they otherwise were simply

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:19.130
overcome by the fumes before help could come.)

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:23.990
Moving outside of Britain, famously Emperor
Frederick I once was rescued from such a fate

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:30.000
in 1184 by grabbing onto a window as the floor
collapsed and hanging on for dear life until

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.320
help came, though certain members of his court
standing nearby were not so lucky.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:39.579
Back in Britain, one Richard the Raker is
remembered in history thanks solely to sitting

00:08:39.579 --> 00:08:44.459
down on his own privy one day and having the
rotted boards brake under him, causing him

00:08:44.459 --> 00:08:50.110
to fall into the muck below and “drown in
a dreadful manner”, as recorded in the London

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:53.100
Coroners’ Roll of 1326.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:57.420
Back to the gong farmers, amplifying the risks
of their profession was the fact that they

00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:02.749
worked exclusively at night, so that the smell
of harvesting and carting the poop around

00:09:02.749 --> 00:09:05.389
wouldn’t bother the day walkers of the world.

00:09:05.389 --> 00:09:10.149
We imagine having fire as the sole source
of lighting doing such work probably also

00:09:10.149 --> 00:09:13.760
created a nice little bonus danger to the
profession, though we couldn’t specifically

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:19.139
find any documented record of a gong farmer
dying as a result of gas pockets exploding

00:09:19.139 --> 00:09:23.390
(though, for what little it’s worth, there
are some references who claim such did happen,

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:27.120
but without citing a specific known instance).

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:31.350
As for where the poop went after being harvested,
given the volume they were dealing with, gong

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:34.899
farmers generally weren’t allowed to just
go and dump the barrels of muck directly into

00:09:34.899 --> 00:09:35.899
the river.

00:09:35.899 --> 00:09:39.860
Instead, they were supposed to take the waste
to designated spots away from the city or

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:43.910
town; these spots could be anything from a
public land area to sometimes ships which

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:46.930
would carry the waste off to a farther away
destination.

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:51.910
Either way, this concentrated mass of waste
often ended up being used as fertiliser.

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:56.399
Lazy gong farmers, however, do seem to have
occasionally dumped it directly into a stream

00:09:56.399 --> 00:10:01.429
or river, though the consequences for being
discovered doing this in some regions were

00:10:01.429 --> 00:10:03.260
decidedly unpleasant.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:07.510
For example, there is record of one gong farmer
who improperly disposed of some waste being

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:12.569
made to stand immersed in fecal matter up
to his neck and then, dripping with said waste,

00:10:12.569 --> 00:10:17.490
was further forced to stand on public display
for a time as punishment.

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:22.529
It should also be noted that public latrine
facilities did exist, often either emptying

00:10:22.529 --> 00:10:25.779
directly into a river, such as the ones on
London Bridge, or otherwise collecting in

00:10:25.779 --> 00:10:29.490
a cesspit that would be routinely emptied
as needed.

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:33.750
However, as the population swelled to massive
numbers in certain cities, like London, the

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:37.420
number of these facilities just couldn’t
keep up with demand.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:42.959
As we move beyond the Middle Ages, with sewage
infrastructure and technology progressing

00:10:42.959 --> 00:10:47.679
slightly, the people of British cities still
nevertheless continued to commonly dump their

00:10:47.679 --> 00:10:49.380
chamber pots into rivers.

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:53.189
Compounding the problem was that cesspits
would occasionally overflow into the streets,

00:10:53.189 --> 00:10:56.550
with said waste often just ending up in nearby
rivers and streams anyway because of it…

00:10:56.550 --> 00:11:01.689
In London, specifically, this centuries old
habit of making human waste Poseidon’s problem

00:11:01.689 --> 00:11:05.360
finally in the 19th century bit residents
on the behind.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:09.269
The problem started thanks to an unnaturally
warm summer which resulted in centuries of

00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:12.629
fetid waste caking the shores of the Thames
being exposed.

00:11:12.629 --> 00:11:17.809
This then all baked in the Sun, causing a
smell so bad the government first simply attempted

00:11:17.809 --> 00:11:22.400
to re-locate themselves to a new city… but
then when that ingenious plan failed, they

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:27.249
finally ordered the construction of a proper
sewage system to take care of the swelling

00:11:27.249 --> 00:11:31.850
populaces’ poop- a sewage system that is
still in use today, in fact, and pretty much

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:36.689
immediately upon its creation began saving
literally thousands of lives per month.

00:11:36.689 --> 00:11:39.820
(For much more detail, in one of our most
interesting articles in my opinion, see: The

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:43.850
Great Stink of 1858.)

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:49.249
So to conclude, while dumping one’s fecal
matter out the window appears to be something

00:11:49.249 --> 00:11:55.019
that did at least occasionally happen in the
Middle Ages in Britain, the evidence at hand

00:11:55.019 --> 00:12:00.509
seems to indicate that this was a relatively
rare occurrence; the majority of human waste

00:12:00.509 --> 00:12:05.249
that found its way into the streets tended
to just be from things like overflowing cesspits,

00:12:05.249 --> 00:12:10.000
which the more affluent used as a part of
their rudimentary indoor plumbing systems.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.129
As for the rest of the populace of cities,
they generally pooped into containers, the

00:12:14.129 --> 00:12:19.670
contents of which they would (usually) deposit
into a nearby river or stream, or gutter system

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:23.489
that led to such.

00:12:23.489 --> 00:12:27.750
Despite the centuries of technological innovation
made since the Middle Ages, the streets of

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:33.160
Victorian London were likely more filthy than
those of the city in Medieval times.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:38.059
This was due to the widespread adoption of
horse drawn carriage which caked the streets

00:12:38.059 --> 00:12:42.929
of the city in a near-permanent sheet of horse
dung and urine, despite the efforts of countless

00:12:42.929 --> 00:12:45.709
workers in charge of keeping the streets clean.

00:12:45.709 --> 00:12:51.589
For reference here, it is estimated that approximately
1,000 tons of horse dung per day was deposited

00:12:51.589 --> 00:12:53.939
in the streets of London in the late 19th
century.

00:12:53.939 --> 00:12:58.290
The ammonia from the urine was known to discolour
shop fronts and the amount of soot in the

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:14.079
air from factories was said to be able to
turn sheep black in 

00:13:14.079 --> 00:13:16.209
a few days.
