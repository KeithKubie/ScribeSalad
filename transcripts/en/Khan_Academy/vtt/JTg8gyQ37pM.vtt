00:00:01.259 --> 00:00:03.596
- [Voiceover] What is
the area of the figure?

00:00:03.596 --> 00:00:06.730
So down here we have this one, two, three,

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.656
four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, 10-sided figure,

00:00:11.656 --> 00:00:13.173
and we want to know its area,

00:00:13.173 --> 00:00:17.656
how many square meters
does this figure cover?

00:00:17.656 --> 00:00:18.672
And we have some measurements,

00:00:18.672 --> 00:00:20.442
that seems helpful,

00:00:20.442 --> 00:00:21.807
but what's not too helpful to me is

00:00:21.807 --> 00:00:23.090
I don't know the special trick

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.173
to find the area of a 10-sided figure

00:00:27.058 --> 00:00:29.148
so I've got to think about what I do know

00:00:29.148 --> 00:00:30.280
and what I do know

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.153
is the way to find area of a rectangle.

00:00:33.153 --> 00:00:36.375
So what I can do, because I can see,

00:00:36.375 --> 00:00:38.380
if I can find any rectangles in here.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.952
Here's one rectangle, right there.

00:00:41.952 --> 00:00:44.755
So I can find the area of that part.

00:00:44.755 --> 00:00:46.403
Then let's see if I can find any more.

00:00:46.403 --> 00:00:48.486
Here's another rectangle.

00:00:51.863 --> 00:00:54.631
So I can find the area of that part.

00:00:54.631 --> 00:00:57.359
We could call that one
a rectangle or a square.

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:01.421
And then that leaves
us with this last part,

00:01:01.421 --> 00:01:03.754
which is again, a rectangle.

00:01:05.852 --> 00:01:07.739
So what we did is, we broke this up

00:01:07.739 --> 00:01:11.077
or decomposed it into three rectangles

00:01:11.077 --> 00:01:12.644
and now if I find out how much space

00:01:12.644 --> 00:01:14.617
this purple one covers,

00:01:14.617 --> 00:01:17.258
and the blue one and the green one,

00:01:17.258 --> 00:01:19.783
if I combine those, that
would tell me the area

00:01:19.783 --> 00:01:21.148
of the entire figure,

00:01:21.148 --> 00:01:24.283
how much space the entire figure covers.

00:01:24.283 --> 00:01:25.938
So let's start with this one right here.

00:01:25.938 --> 00:01:28.433
This one is three meters long,

00:01:28.433 --> 00:01:30.771
so we can kind of divide
that by three meters,

00:01:30.771 --> 00:01:33.142
into three equal meters,

00:01:33.142 --> 00:01:35.929
and then we've got a width
of two meters down here

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.960
so we can split that in half.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.460
So if we draw those lines out,

00:01:42.488 --> 00:01:46.312
we can see this top row is
going to cover one square meter,

00:01:46.312 --> 00:01:49.505
two square meters, three square meters,

00:01:49.505 --> 00:01:51.072
and then there's two rows of that,

00:01:51.072 --> 00:01:52.655
so there's two rows

00:01:53.696 --> 00:01:55.690
of three square meters

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.169
for a total of six square meters.

00:01:59.169 --> 00:02:02.174
This rectangle covers six square meters,

00:02:02.174 --> 00:02:04.507
so this part of the entire figure

00:02:04.507 --> 00:02:06.915
covers six square meters.

00:02:06.915 --> 00:02:10.863
The next one, our measurements
are three and a three,

00:02:10.863 --> 00:02:13.765
so it will have three rows
of three square meters

00:02:13.765 --> 00:02:15.598
or nine square meters,

00:02:17.093 --> 00:02:19.377
and then finally this purple one

00:02:19.377 --> 00:02:21.205
has three meters and nine,

00:02:21.205 --> 00:02:24.112
so we can say it will
have three rows of nine

00:02:24.112 --> 00:02:25.965
or nine rows of three square meters

00:02:25.965 --> 00:02:28.132
which is 27 square meters.

00:02:29.685 --> 00:02:30.602
So the area

00:02:32.036 --> 00:02:34.648
of this purple section,

00:02:34.648 --> 00:02:38.073
it covers completely 27 square meters.

00:02:38.073 --> 00:02:40.772
The green covers nine square meters,

00:02:40.772 --> 00:02:43.907
and the blue covered six square meters.

00:02:43.907 --> 00:02:47.012
So, if we combine all those areas,

00:02:47.012 --> 00:02:48.678
all those square meters it covers,

00:02:48.678 --> 00:02:51.989
that will tell us the
area of the entire figure.

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.457
So we have six square meters,

00:02:54.457 --> 00:02:57.098
plus nine square meters,

00:02:57.098 --> 00:02:57.931
plus 27,

00:02:59.584 --> 00:03:03.546
and we can solve that,
six plus nine is 15,

00:03:03.546 --> 00:03:05.379
15 plus 27, let's see,

00:03:06.492 --> 00:03:08.603
five ones and seven ones

00:03:08.603 --> 00:03:09.520
is 12 ones.

00:03:11.713 --> 00:03:13.455
We'll just find some space up there.

00:03:13.455 --> 00:03:14.288
And

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.676
one 10 and two 10's

00:03:16.676 --> 00:03:18.402
or a 10 and a 20

00:03:18.402 --> 00:03:19.235
is 30.

00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:22.791
And 30 plus 12 is 42.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.701
So the area of the entire figure is

00:03:26.701 --> 00:03:27.534
42

00:03:28.656 --> 00:03:29.489
square

00:03:31.271 --> 00:03:32.104
meters.
