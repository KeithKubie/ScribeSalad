to have to do and we tend to think it's

to have to do and we tend to think it's
 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.630
to have to do and we tend to think it's
good for us that we don't have to do it

good for us that we don't have to do it
 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.030
good for us that we don't have to do it
because if we're going to be sincere and

well but again let's suppose for a

you're onto something that we are just

these patterns creatures and these

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030
these patterns creatures and these
 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.819
these patterns creatures and these
patterns are potentially very dangerous

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829
patterns are potentially very dangerous
 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.970

so how do we break them that's why you

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980
so how do we break them that's why you
 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.330
so how do we break them that's why you
do rituals what rituals do is they force

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340
do rituals what rituals do is they force
 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.789
do rituals what rituals do is they force
you for a brief moment to become a

you for a brief moment to become a
different person

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549

and interact with those around you in a
 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.820
and interact with those around you in a
different way so for that brief moment

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830
different way so for that brief moment
 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.289
different way so for that brief moment
suddenly you're no longer repeating the

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299
suddenly you're no longer repeating the
 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.600
suddenly you're no longer repeating the
same old patterns you're doing something

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610
same old patterns you're doing something
 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.539

blah blah our typical patterns in this
 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.520

language and then we see someone we say

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530
language and then we see someone we say
 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.260
language and then we see someone we say
oh hey how's it going and the other

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270
oh hey how's it going and the other
 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.450
oh hey how's it going and the other
person goes oh pretty good how are you

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460
person goes oh pretty good how are you
 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.190

was it oh yeah I'm pretty good too and

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200
was it oh yeah I'm pretty good too and
 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.889
was it oh yeah I'm pretty good too and
then we walk off now if you think about

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899
then we walk off now if you think about
 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.230
then we walk off now if you think about
it you might think well it's sort of

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240
it you might think well it's sort of
 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.530
it you might think well it's sort of
silly that we do that because that's

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540
silly that we do that because that's
 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.510
silly that we do that because that's
inauthentic I'm actually not feeling

inauthentic I'm actually not feeling
pretty good right then but if you think

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860
pretty good right then but if you think
 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.069
pretty good right then but if you think
of it as a ritual it's actually a very

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079
of it as a ritual it's actually a very
 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.480
of it as a ritual it's actually a very
good thing to do and we should even do

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490
good thing to do and we should even do
 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.340
good thing to do and we should even do
it more fully because then what you're

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350
it more fully because then what you're
 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.830
it more fully because then what you're
doing is you're breaking out of that

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840
doing is you're breaking out of that
 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.139
doing is you're breaking out of that
standard set of patterns of the ways

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149
standard set of patterns of the ways

you're going about the day for that

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710
you're going about the day for that
 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.430
you're going about the day for that
brief moment you suddenly and I'll use

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440
brief moment you suddenly and I'll use
 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.170
brief moment you suddenly and I'll use
their language you enter a ritual space

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180
their language you enter a ritual space
 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.030
their language you enter a ritual space
you're connecting with someone things

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040
you're connecting with someone things
 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.440
you're connecting with someone things
are going well you're connecting with

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450
are going well you're connecting with
 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.750
are going well you're connecting with
this person perfectly it breaks you out

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760
this person perfectly it breaks you out
 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.940
this person perfectly it breaks you out
of those patterns and then if you're

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950
of those patterns and then if you're
 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.009
of those patterns and then if you're
doing that sort of thing these little

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019
doing that sort of thing these little
 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.470
doing that sort of thing these little
seemingly meaningless rituals over the

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480
seemingly meaningless rituals over the
 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.839
seemingly meaningless rituals over the
course of a day consistently you're

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849
course of a day consistently you're
 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.130
course of a day consistently you're
breaking yourself out of these little

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140
breaking yourself out of these little
 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.410
breaking yourself out of these little
patterns and opening up other

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420
patterns and opening up other
 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.020
patterns and opening up other
possibilities and they would argue that

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030
possibilities and they would argue that
 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.080

is why ritual matters it breaks us out

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090
is why ritual matters it breaks us out
 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.750
is why ritual matters it breaks us out
of patterns we enter it to an AZ of

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760
of patterns we enter it to an AZ of
 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.729
of patterns we enter it to an AZ of
space we act as if we are a different

interacting with those around us in a

interacting with those around us in a
 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.619
interacting with those around us in a
different way and that is over time how

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:49.629
different way and that is over time how
 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:52.289
different way and that is over time how
you break these patterns so this may

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299
you break these patterns so this may
 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.479
you break these patterns so this may
seem somewhat odd if we're entering into

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489
seem somewhat odd if we're entering into
 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.610
seem somewhat odd if we're entering into
a ritual which of course it gives us

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620
a ritual which of course it gives us
 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.069
a ritual which of course it gives us
different patterns of interaction how is

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079
different patterns of interaction how is
 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:00.899
different patterns of interaction how is
that actually going to improve the fact

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:00.909
that actually going to improve the fact
 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:03.240
that actually going to improve the fact
that we are doing other patterns outside

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250
that we are doing other patterns outside
 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.720
that we are doing other patterns outside

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730
of it
 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.240
of it
well here's their full argument if we

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250
well here's their full argument if we
 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.949
well here's their full argument if we
are going throughout our days they would

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959
are going throughout our days they would
 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.629
are going throughout our days they would
argue simply repeating these same

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:09.639
argue simply repeating these same
 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:11.759
argue simply repeating these same

on our same standard responses our same

on our same standard responses our same

on our same standard responses our same
standard habits what ritual will do is

standard habits what ritual will do is

standard habits what ritual will do is
break those patterns they will give you

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269
break those patterns they will give you
 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.089
break those patterns they will give you
new patterns but the argument they would

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099
new patterns but the argument they would
 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.369
new patterns but the argument they would
make is it's not that the ritual

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:23.379
make is it's not that the ritual
 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:25.530
make is it's not that the ritual
patterns are the right one it's the

patterns are the right one it's the
 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.750
patterns are the right one it's the
break they care about now let's go back

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760
break they care about now let's go back
 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.119
break they care about now let's go back
to the greeting example I see someone Oh

things are fine I connect for that brief

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290
things are fine I connect for that brief
 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.379
things are fine I connect for that brief
moment then of course that person passes

and I return to my usual patterns in
 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.020
and I return to my usual patterns in
their language I return I leave the

their language I return I leave the
 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.379
their language I return I leave the

someone and it's those little breaks
those little shifts that make a

those little shifts that make a
 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.349
those little shifts that make a
difference over the course of a day then

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359
difference over the course of a day then
 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:00.330
difference over the course of a day then

takes you they would argue is over time
you begin to get a sense of the ways

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620
you begin to get a sense of the ways
 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.280
you begin to get a sense of the ways
that little things you do are affecting

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290
that little things you do are affecting
 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.349

and those around us and you begin to
 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.159
and those around us and you begin to
gain the power to alter those so you

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169
gain the power to alter those so you
 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:19.620
gain the power to alter those so you
have a standard argument that one always

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630
have a standard argument that one always
 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.290

has with one's partner and that person

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300
has with one's partner and that person

says something it makes me angry that
makes that person angry and we go the

00:04:26.459 --> 00:04:26.469
makes that person angry and we go the
 

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.939
makes that person angry and we go the
same

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:26.949
same
 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:30.790

you take these ideas seriously begin to
 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.860
you take these ideas seriously begin to
slightly shift that begin to slightly

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870
slightly shift that begin to slightly
 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.900
slightly shift that begin to slightly
shift the standard pattern you fall into

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910
shift the standard pattern you fall into
 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.990
shift the standard pattern you fall into
and even if there's not a set ritual

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000
and even if there's not a set ritual
 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.030
and even if there's not a set ritual
that gives you the ability to do so you

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040
that gives you the ability to do so you
 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.010
that gives you the ability to do so you
gain the same thing by simply doing a

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020
gain the same thing by simply doing a
 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.650
gain the same thing by simply doing a
little break so you hold your body

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660
little break so you hold your body
 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.270
little break so you hold your body
slightly differently use a slightly

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280
slightly differently use a slightly
 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.280
slightly differently use a slightly
different tone of voice you bring in

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290
different tone of voice you bring in
 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:52.840
different tone of voice you bring in
something other than you would normally

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850
something other than you would normally
 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.300
something other than you would normally
bring in and you'll notice immediately a

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310
bring in and you'll notice immediately a
 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.219
bring in and you'll notice immediately a
slight shift and the other person too

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229
slight shift and the other person too
 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:00.490
slight shift and the other person too
and then you keep doing that and over

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500
and then you keep doing that and over
 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.440
and then you keep doing that and over
time and it takes a while but over time

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450
time and it takes a while but over time
 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.750
time and it takes a while but over time
you'll see that the same standard

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760
you'll see that the same standard
 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.280
you'll see that the same standard
pattern that you unconsciously are

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290
pattern that you unconsciously are
 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:07.960
pattern that you unconsciously are
falling into it those around you

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970
falling into it those around you
 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.510
falling into it those around you
begins to shift and that's what they

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520
begins to shift and that's what they
 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.390
begins to shift and that's what they
care about the rituals create the breaks

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400
care about the rituals create the breaks
 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.300
care about the rituals create the breaks
over time this shifts how we are

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310
over time this shifts how we are
 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.640
over time this shifts how we are
interacting in the world and then over

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650
interacting in the world and then over
 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.260
interacting in the world and then over
time what you gain is the ability to

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270
time what you gain is the ability to
 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.290
time what you gain is the ability to
sort of work with these rituals or work

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300
sort of work with these rituals or work
 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.060
sort of work with these rituals or work
with these patterns such that you're no

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070
with these patterns such that you're no
 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.129
with these patterns such that you're no
longer simply repeating them you're able

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:27.139
longer simply repeating them you're able
 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:29.230
longer simply repeating them you're able
to shift them and alter them according

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240
to shift them and alter them according
 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.480
to shift them and alter them according
to the circumstances and they would say

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490
to the circumstances and they would say
 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.270
to the circumstances and they would say
that's how over time you learn how to

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280
that's how over time you learn how to
 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.340
that's how over time you learn how to
build better interactions how to build

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.350
build better interactions how to build
 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.710
build better interactions how to build
better relationships really in the least

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720
better relationships really in the least
 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.629
better relationships really in the least
strong language here how to create very

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639
strong language here how to create very
 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:42.790
strong language here how to create very
different worlds because you're acting

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800
different worlds because you're acting
 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.680
different worlds because you're acting
in such different ways that you bring

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690
in such different ways that you bring
 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.510
in such different ways that you bring
out very different responses from those

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520
out very different responses from those
 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.030
out very different responses from those
around you
