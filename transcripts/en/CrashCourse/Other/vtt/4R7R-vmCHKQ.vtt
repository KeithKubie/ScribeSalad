00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.880
Hi I'm John Green

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.560
and this is a video of a cat

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.780
wearing a shark costume, riding a roomba

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.660
which has 12 million views on youtube

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.840
and deservedly so

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.920
it is probably the second best video

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.400
in the entire world of a cat wearing a shark costume

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.180
riding a roomba

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.920
beaten out only by this video

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.360
of a cat wearing a shark costume

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.340
riding a roomba, chasing a duck

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.920
here at crash course our videos are watched more than 700,000 times a day

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.620
and they are used in thousands of schools around the world

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.980
But our most popular single video has 6.8 million views

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.460
and that's great

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.520
but it's no cat wearing a shark costume riding a roomba

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.160
An Internet funded by advertising

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.760
is really good at funding

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.760
the creation of cat-shark-roomba videos

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.680
and that's important because I don't

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.020
want to live in a world without such videos.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.340
The ad-funded Internet excels at making

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.580
stuff that you will look at or click on

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.520
because advertisers care most about how many eyeballs

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.920
Are going to see their advertisement. But that Internet

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.720
Doesn't necessarily do a good job of

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.560
supporting stuff people will love

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.740
or that will have a lasting impact on them.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.380
Back in 2012 we were able to start

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.580
Crash Course thanks to a grant from Google

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.980
but the channel has been able to continue

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.140
and grow because of your contributions

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.700
on Patreon and because of support from PBS,

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.540
the Public Broadcasting Service here

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.720
in the United States.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.740
PBS Digital Studios funds a

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.840
lot of my favorite educational channels

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.160
from Its OK to be Smart,

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.980
Physics Girl as well as two

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.480
Crash Courses per year

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.500
and PBS's Learning Media platform

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.180
connects those videos directly

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.040
to teachers and students which

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.800
broadens our reach, and also gives

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.800
schools free resources so they don't have to

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.200
pay to license content.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.980
Without PBS there would be only two

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.880
Crash Course videos a week around here,

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.280
their funding allowed us to create

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.840
series in computer science, physics,

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.820
astronomy, and US government.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.340
And every day we hear from learners

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.780
of all ages how those videos

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.460
have helped them understand material

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.860
and more importantly, get excited about learning.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.000
Because education is not merely a series of

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.500
tortures that one must endure to receive a degree

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.160
it's the process of becoming more aware of

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.540
and engaged with the universe and

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.700
your place in it and

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.420
we really hope that Crash Course can play a small role

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.220
in that process.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.880
So you've probably heard in the new recently

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.640
that there have been proposals to drastically

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.180
cut or even eliminate federal funding

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.880
for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.500
which provides critical support to local

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.500
television and radio stations.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.400
Public Broadcasting's federal funding

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.280
amounts to about $1.35 per American per year

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.720
now obviously I'm biased

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.680
but I think they create a lot of value

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.100
with that money and not just through

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.700
Crash Course and the art assignment.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.520
So listen, most American high school students

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.640
know what Crash Course is

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.500
but I think it's safe to say that many

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.600
US senators and congresspeople don't.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.200
And if you care about Crash Course or other

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.460
or other PBS Digital shows I want to

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.660
ask you to take a few minutes and contact

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.560
your member of Congress and let them know.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.900
Now when asked to do this I used to be like

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.160
"Yeah whatever I don't like calling strangers for pizza...

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.440
...let alone to voice a political opinion."

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.380
But now that I've made a few calls

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.740
on issues that are important to me

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.400
I've realized that (1), it's easy,

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.860
and (2), it really helps your elected leaders to

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.500
understand what's important to you.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.560
They want to hear from their constituents

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.500
and they benefit from it

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.340
so I put some resources in the video info

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.880
below, thanks to everybody who contacts

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.260
their representatives and senators

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.940
to let them know that there is value

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.100
in PBS and in the local stations

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.400
and content they support.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.680
Also, you can let your friends know

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.980
that you support PBS by talking

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.760
your favorite PBS content and

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.220
and using the #ILOVEPBS

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.800
and you can learn much more about

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.000
the value PBS provides over at

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.760
PBS.org/value.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.080
I'm sorry to interrupt your regularly

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.260
scheduled Crash Course but the

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.160
but the future of PBS is very important

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.120
to the future of Crash Course so thank you for

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.140
watching, thanks again for contacting

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.320
your representatives and senators

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.020
and as we say in my hometown,

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.213
don't forget to be awesome.
