00:00:00.424 --> 00:00:03.153
Let's say you have a cherry pie store.

00:00:03.153 --> 00:00:04.520
and you've noticed that

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.602
there is variability in the number of cherries

00:00:06.602 --> 00:00:09.181
on each pie that you sell.

00:00:09.181 --> 00:00:11.665
Some pies might have over 100 cherries,

00:00:11.665 --> 00:00:15.381
while other pies might have fewer than 50 cherries.

00:00:15.381 --> 00:00:16.560
So what you're curious about is

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.621
what is the distribution,

00:00:17.621 --> 00:00:20.401
how many of different types of pies do you have?

00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:22.289
how may pies do you have that have a lot of cherries,

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.072
how many pies that have a few cherries,

00:00:25.072 --> 00:00:27.461
how many pies are in between?

00:00:27.461 --> 00:00:29.486
So, to do that, you set up a histogram.

00:00:29.486 --> 00:00:32.881
what you do is you take each pie in your store,

00:00:32.881 --> 00:00:36.779
(See I can draw a pie in some kind)

00:00:36.779 --> 00:00:40.991
it's a cherry pie, I don't know if this is adequate of drawing of a pie.

00:00:40.991 --> 00:00:44.133
You take each pie in your store,

00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:49.134
and you count the number of cherries on it.

00:00:49.134 --> 00:00:50.927
This pie has 1,2,3,4,5

00:00:50.927 --> 00:00:54.277
6,7,8,9,10,keep counting

00:00:54.277 --> 00:00:56.701
Let's say it has 32 cherries.

00:00:56.701 --> 00:00:58.148
And you are going to do it for every pie.

00:00:58.148 --> 00:00:59.888
and then you create buckets.

00:00:59.888 --> 00:01:01.921
Because you don't want to create just a graph

00:01:01.921 --> 00:01:03.521
I'm not having exactly 32.

00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:05.187
You just want to get a general sense of things.

00:01:05.187 --> 00:01:08.737
So you create buckets of 30

00:01:08.737 --> 00:01:12.076
you say how many pies have between 0 and 29 cherries?

00:01:12.076 --> 00:01:16.656
how many pies are between 30 and 59, including 30 and 59?

00:01:16.656 --> 00:01:19.987
how many pies have at least 60 at most 89 cherries?

00:01:19.987 --> 00:01:23.303
how many pies have at least 90 at most 119?

00:01:23.303 --> 00:01:27.677
and then how many pies have at least 120 and at most 149?

00:01:27.677 --> 00:01:30.966
you know that you don't have any pie that have more than 149 cherries

00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:32.523
so this should account for everything.

00:01:32.523 --> 00:01:33.503
Then you count them

00:01:33.503 --> 00:01:37.391
so for example, 5 pies have more than 30 to 59 cherries

00:01:37.391 --> 00:01:39.029
and so we create a histogram

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:43.375
when you create a histogram, you make this magenta bar go up to 5

00:01:43.375 --> 00:01:45.789
so that's how you would construct this histogram

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:49.736
that's what the pies at different cherry levels histogram is telling us.

00:01:49.736 --> 00:01:52.713
so now we have construct it; Let's see if we can interpret it

00:01:52.713 --> 00:01:56.084
based on the information given in the histogram.

00:01:56.084 --> 00:01:57.560
So the first question is:

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.293
based on just this information

00:01:59.293 --> 00:02:00.704
can you figure out the total

00:02:00.704 --> 00:02:03.112
number of pies in your store?

00:02:03.112 --> 00:02:05.269
soon be there all accounted for by this histogram

00:02:05.269 --> 00:02:06.610
and I encourage you to pause this video

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.680
and try to figure it out on your own

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.938
What was the total number of pies?

00:02:10.938 --> 00:02:13.457
Let's see. There's five pies

00:02:13.457 --> 00:02:21.573
there's five pies that have ... at least 30 cherries but no more than 59.

00:02:21.573 --> 00:02:24.697
you have eight pies in this blue bucket

00:02:24.697 --> 00:02:27.886
you have four pies in this green bucket

00:02:27.886 --> 00:02:31.235
and then you have ... three pies

00:02:31.235 --> 00:02:35.234
that have at least 120 but no more than 149 cherries

00:02:35.234 --> 00:02:37.935
this accounts for all the pies

00:02:37.935 --> 00:02:40.275
so the total number of pies you have at the store

00:02:40.275 --> 00:02:44.689
5 plus 8 plus 4 plus 3

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:48.568
which is what, 5 plus 8 is 13

00:02:48.568 --> 00:02:51.756
plus 4,=17, plus 3 is twenty.

00:02:51.756 --> 00:02:55.370
So there are 20 pies in this store.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.239
Then you can ask more a more nuance question.

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.258
what if you want to know the number of pies with more than 60 cherries

00:03:01.258 --> 00:03:03.242
the number of pies with more than 60

00:03:03.242 --> 00:03:08.157
number of pies with

00:03:08.157 --> 00:03:09.922
I'll say this 60 or more

00:03:09.922 --> 00:03:15.861
60 or more cherries

00:03:15.861 --> 00:03:17.427
so let's think about it.

00:03:17.427 --> 00:03:19.721
well this magenta bar doesn't apply

00:03:19.721 --> 00:03:21.436
because these all have less than 60

00:03:21.436 --> 00:03:25.024
but all these other bars are accounting pies that have 60 or more cherries

00:03:25.024 --> 00:03:27.538
this is 60 to 89, this is 90 to 119

00:03:27.538 --> 00:03:30.341
this is a 120 to 149

00:03:30.341 --> 00:03:32.289
so it's going to be these eight cherries

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:36.653
sorry, these eight pies that are in this bucket

00:03:36.653 --> 00:03:41.182
plus these four pies, plus these three pies

00:03:41.182 --> 00:03:45.309
so it is going to be essentially everything but this first bucket

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:47.802
everything but all the pies except for these five pies

00:03:47.802 --> 00:03:49.568
have 60 or more cherries

00:03:49.568 --> 00:03:51.506
so should be five less than 20

00:03:51.506 --> 00:03:54.179
Let's see. 8+4=12,plus 3 is 15

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:56.721
which is five less than 20.

00:03:56.721 --> 00:03:58.005
So using this histogram

00:03:58.005 --> 00:03:59.309
we can answer really interest question, which would say

00:03:59.309 --> 00:04:04.130
how many more pies do we have that have 60-89 cherries

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.848
than 120 to 149 cherries?

00:04:06.848 --> 00:04:09.386
We have eight pies at 60-89

00:04:09.386 --> 00:04:12.285
60-89 cherries, three that have a 120-149

00:04:12.285 --> 00:04:16.581
We have five more pies in the 60 to 89 category

00:04:16.581 --> 00:04:20.528
that we do in the 120 to 149 categories

00:04:20.528 --> 00:04:22.731
A lot of questions that we can start to answer

00:04:22.731 --> 00:04:24.155
hopefully this gives you a sense

00:04:24.155 --> 00:04:27.969
of how you can interpret histograms.
