00:00:00.128 --> 00:00:02.504
Now we’re going to look at a very simplistic model

00:00:02.504 --> 00:00:05.091
of a food chain. It’s so simple that we’re only going

00:00:05.091 --> 00:00:08.116
to consider two species of fish. One is the predator

00:00:08.116 --> 00:00:10.149
and one is its prey. You are going to model the

00:00:10.149 --> 00:00:12.323
change of either population the predator and the

00:00:12.323 --> 00:00:15.174
prey using differential equations in the form of

00:00:15.174 --> 00:00:17.719
these equations right here. It’s up to you to figure

00:00:17.719 --> 00:00:19.907
out, however, which of these corresponds to the

00:00:19.907 --> 00:00:21.799
predator and which one to the prey. There is

00:00:21.799 --> 00:00:23.734
several other features of this situation that must be

00:00:23.734 --> 00:00:26.716
taken into account. The prey multiplies at a certain

00:00:26.716 --> 00:00:29.433
rate. The prey is consumed by the predator that’s

00:00:29.433 --> 00:00:32.002
kind of a given. The predators, however, only die

00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:35.134
of old age and the predator’s population also

00:00:35.134 --> 00:00:37.928
multiplies depending on the amount of prey that is

00:00:37.928 --> 00:00:41.562
present. Now in these equations A, B, C, and D

00:00:41.562 --> 00:00:44.729
are constants. And in our program over here, you

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:47.228
are going to fill in their values in this dictionary

00:00:47.228 --> 00:00:50.009
called base values. We’ve already provided you

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:52.878
with the values corresponding to two keys in base

00:00:52.878 --> 00:00:56.327
values. We’ve included the initial amount of prey

00:00:56.327 --> 00:00:58.697
and the initial amount of the predator population

00:00:58.697 --> 00:01:00.263
measured in tons.

00:01:00.263 --> 00:01:02.189
Here however is some other important information

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:03.768
that you’ll need to know in order to do this

00:01:03.768 --> 00:01:07.245
problem. The rate of growth of the prey is 0.5 per

00:01:07.245 --> 00:01:10.742
year and the life span of the predator is five year.

00:01:10.742 --> 00:01:13.244
In addition, we will reach an equilibrium situation

00:01:13.244 --> 00:01:16.242
or a steady state situation with the amount of prey

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:19.871
reaches five times and the amount of predator

00:01:19.871 --> 00:01:22.959
reaches one times. You are going to use this

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:25.625
information, a little bit of logic and these equations

00:01:25.625 --> 00:01:28.207
to calculate A, B, C, and D.

00:01:28.207 --> 00:01:31.360
Once you enter A, B, C, and D into base values,

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.595
we’ll move down to look at this function called food

00:01:33.595 --> 00:01:37.077
chain. Here you’ll use the familiar forward method

00:01:37.077 --> 00:01:39.532
to calculate the future populations of the prey and

00:01:39.532 --> 00:01:42.439
the predator at each time step. Lastly, you’ll do a

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.098
bit of sensitivity analysis. We are going to add in a

00:01:45.098 --> 00:01:47.315
degree of uncertainty to this problem to make it a

00:01:47.315 --> 00:01:51.081
little bit more complex. Let’s say that A, B, C, and

00:01:51.081 --> 00:01:54.949
D as well as the initial amounts of both fish are

00:01:54.949 --> 00:01:58.358
uncertain by plus or minus 10%. Similar to your

00:01:58.358 --> 00:02:01.081
earlier quiz you are going to create dictionaries for

00:02:01.081 --> 00:02:03.391
the minimum and maximum values taking this

00:02:03.391 --> 00:02:06.157
uncertainty into account and then determine which

00:02:06.157 --> 00:02:08.874
of these six parameters A, B, C, and D and the

00:02:08.874 --> 00:02:11.858
two initial values has the largest impact on the

00:02:11.858 --> 00:02:14.443
maximum amount of prey. Again, office is very

00:02:14.443 --> 00:02:16.959
similar to the quiz insensitivity analysis that you

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:18.944
saw on the unit itself. So if you’re having any

00:02:18.944 --> 00:02:21.444
trouble, you might want to review that quiz and of

00:02:21.444 --> 00:02:23.241
course you can always come to the forums for

00:02:23.241 --> 00:02:26.000
more help. Good luck.
