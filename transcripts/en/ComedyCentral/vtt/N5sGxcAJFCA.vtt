00:00:01.435 --> 00:00:03.003
but it looks like that's
the last time that bear

00:00:03.103 --> 00:00:04.471
will be going to Whole Foods.

00:00:04.571 --> 00:00:05.772
Amy.

00:00:05.906 --> 00:00:07.708
I hope you're
right about that, Fleet.

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:10.277
Oh, they're having a <i>bear</i>
of a time though, aren't they?

00:00:10.377 --> 00:00:11.778
I can hardly <i>bear</i> it.

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:13.647
(laughing)

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:15.082
Oh.

00:00:15.148 --> 00:00:17.718
Everyone's talking about
the record-setting cold

00:00:17.818 --> 00:00:19.553
we've been
experiencing this winter

00:00:19.653 --> 00:00:21.321
with temperatures dropping
into the single digits.

00:00:21.455 --> 00:00:22.623
We went to Central Park

00:00:22.723 --> 00:00:25.025
to talk to people about
how they're coping.

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:27.528
Well, it's been so cold,
it's just hard to do everything.

00:00:27.628 --> 00:00:29.863
Well, not everything.

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:32.032
Seth, shut up.

00:00:32.132 --> 00:00:35.002
What an adorably
cold couple.

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:36.303
Certainly looks like
they're going to be

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:37.938
keeping each other warm,
huh, Am?

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:39.940
(forced laughing)

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.743
Yes.

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:44.444
I'm sorry.

00:00:44.578 --> 00:00:46.713
Rob, can we see those
last two people again?

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:48.615
Is something wrong, Amy?

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:50.717
Just show those
people again, please.

00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:52.986
It's just hard
to do everything.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.022
Well, not everything.

00:00:55.122 --> 00:00:57.090
Okay,
that's my boyfriend.

00:00:57.191 --> 00:00:58.525
What? I thought you were
on a break.

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:00.060
You sent out that email
you were on a break.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.529
Well, he's obviously
not taking a break.

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:03.964
We're still live, Am.
He's not on break.

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:05.532
Definitely live.
Okay.

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.401
Still live.
Okay, sorry about that.

00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:09.436
In Washington Heights
this morning,

00:01:09.536 --> 00:01:11.305
a gruesome discovery.

00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:13.373
An elderly woman was found
brutally murdered in her--

00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:14.775
Is she hotter than me?

00:01:14.875 --> 00:01:16.076
What?
Amy, get it together.

00:01:16.143 --> 00:01:17.544
Is she hotter than me?

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:18.846
It's a simple question, folks.

00:01:18.946 --> 00:01:20.380
Chime in.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.782
We're gonna-- we'll take
your answers on Twitter.

00:01:21.882 --> 00:01:23.650
Was that--
In her apartment.

00:01:23.784 --> 00:01:26.086
She was brutally murdered
in her apartment.

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.754
Back to you, Fleet.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.825
Thanks, Amy.

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:34.094
A candlelight vigil is
being held at the United Nations

00:01:34.161 --> 00:01:36.396
tonight in honor of--
I mean, she's Asian,

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.931
but she wasn't even, like,
a hot Asian.

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:39.600
I mean, she may as well
not have even been Asian--

00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:41.435
Five teenagers tonight
are being accused
Was she Taiwanese or something?

00:01:41.535 --> 00:01:43.403
of a hate crime
after they were caught

00:01:43.537 --> 00:01:45.906
spray-painting swastikas
I mean, look at this.

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:48.442
in the parking lot
of a local Chipotle...
Look at this text.

00:01:48.542 --> 00:01:49.943
All of them are students
at the local high school...
He sent this not
even a week ago.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.345
How many exclamation points
is he gonna put?

00:01:51.445 --> 00:01:52.613
... where the teacher
said they had a history

00:01:52.713 --> 00:01:54.314
of disruptive behavior.
Look at this.

00:01:54.414 --> 00:01:56.917
Principal John Robbins says
that the school will be
Look at this-- Are we...

00:01:57.017 --> 00:01:59.953
instituting <i>new</i> classes
that teach tolerance.
Really, we're on a break.

00:02:00.087 --> 00:02:01.455
In other news,

00:02:01.555 --> 00:02:03.423
Madison Square Garden will be
undergoing renovations...

00:02:03.524 --> 00:02:04.491
Pick up the phone,
(bleep).

00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:05.492
Pick up the phone.
... this summer.

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:07.461
Yeah, I just saw you!

00:02:07.594 --> 00:02:09.496
MSG officials have said
the renovations are necessary
I just saw you on my news.

00:02:09.596 --> 00:02:10.764
to accommodate
increasingly elaborate
My news!

00:02:10.864 --> 00:02:12.533
live musical performances,
Yes!

00:02:12.633 --> 00:02:14.635
many of which now include
pyrotechnics
Oh, you need time to
work on your music.

00:02:14.768 --> 00:02:16.136
and detailed
multimedia presentations.
You weren't
trying to miss me?

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.704
You're so
full of (bleep)!

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:19.540
They'll also be increasing
the venue's capacity
Because you are (bleep)!

00:02:19.673 --> 00:02:22.075
From 20,000 to 22,000.
Your dick is garbage,
do you hear me?

00:02:22.176 --> 00:02:23.443
Mayor de Blasio
welcomed the news
I'm gonna find you,
mother(bleep).

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.312
calling Madison Square Garden
the heart of Midtown.

00:02:25.412 --> 00:02:26.914
Bob! Am I the only
(bleep) one here?

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.315
Can't you wrangle
this (bleep)?
