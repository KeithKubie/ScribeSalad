in architectural practice for over 40

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810
in architectural practice for over 40
 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.420
in architectural practice for over 40
years now today's presentation I think

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:24.430
years now today's presentation I think
 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.839
years now today's presentation I think
is very timely the title of it is what

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:27.849
is very timely the title of it is what
 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:29.580
is very timely the title of it is what
does it take to make your building green

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590
does it take to make your building green
 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:35.240
does it take to make your building green
I find in my architectural career that a

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250
I find in my architectural career that a
 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.190
I find in my architectural career that a
more typical question that I get asked

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.200
more typical question that I get asked
 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.470
more typical question that I get asked
is why should we make our buildings

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480
is why should we make our buildings
 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.100
is why should we make our buildings
green I think it's time for a complete

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110
green I think it's time for a complete
 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.619
green I think it's time for a complete
paradigm shift as you see from this

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629
paradigm shift as you see from this
 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:49.500

wastewater utilities another big issue
is the amount of impervious surfaces

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870
is the amount of impervious surfaces
 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.360
is the amount of impervious surfaces
that we've introduced into the United

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370
that we've introduced into the United
 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.420
that we've introduced into the United
States if you look at the total area of

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430
States if you look at the total area of
 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.400

250 million tons of municipal waste that
works out to four point six pounds per

works out to four point six pounds per
 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.120
works out to four point six pounds per
person plus we recycle about 1.5 pounds

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130
person plus we recycle about 1.5 pounds
 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.240

does it take to make your building green

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230
does it take to make your building green
 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.310
does it take to make your building green
there are really three steps in my mind

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320
there are really three steps in my mind
 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.850
there are really three steps in my mind
to do this the first step is to make

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860
to do this the first step is to make
 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.790
to do this the first step is to make
your building zero net energy this means

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800
your building zero net energy this means
 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.980
your building zero net energy this means
that the amount of energy generated on

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990
that the amount of energy generated on
 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.740
that the amount of energy generated on
site is equal to the amount of energy

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750
site is equal to the amount of energy
 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.220
site is equal to the amount of energy
that you consume from the grid whether

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230
that you consume from the grid whether
 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.500
that you consume from the grid whether
it's the electric grid or the natural

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510
it's the electric grid or the natural
 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.630
it's the electric grid or the natural
gas grid the second important step is

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640
gas grid the second important step is
 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.660
gas grid the second important step is
zero carbon this is difficult to attain

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670
zero carbon this is difficult to attain
 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.030
zero carbon this is difficult to attain
the amount of embodied energy and carbon

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040
the amount of embodied energy and carbon
 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.920
the amount of embodied energy and carbon
that is produced in making and

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930
that is produced in making and
 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.480
that is produced in making and
transporting the products to the

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490
transporting the products to the
 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.570
transporting the products to the
building site need to be offset by the

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580
building site need to be offset by the
 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.000
building site need to be offset by the
purchase of renewable energy credits so

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010
purchase of renewable energy credits so
 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.800
purchase of renewable energy credits so
that you zero out the amount of carbon

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810
that you zero out the amount of carbon
 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.680
that you zero out the amount of carbon
related to construction activities but

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690
related to construction activities but
 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.420
related to construction activities but
then once you start operating the

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430
then once you start operating the
 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.970
then once you start operating the
building you have to account for the

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980
building you have to account for the
 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.370
building you have to account for the
carbon that's produced by the operating

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380
carbon that's produced by the operating
 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.360
carbon that's produced by the operating
of that building typically from fossil

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370
of that building typically from fossil
 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.920
of that building typically from fossil
fuels the third step is to make your

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930
fuels the third step is to make your
 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.790
fuels the third step is to make your
building zero water the most aggressive
