00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.730
Amnesia is a real thing.

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:07.870
Now all we need is scientific evidence of
evil twins and life will be just like a CW

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.320
show.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.270
Anthony here for Dnews and Michael Boatwright
woke up in Palm Springs at the Desert Regional

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.250
Medical Center speaking Swedish and convinced
his name was Johan Ek.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.460
According to the Desert Sun, the 61-year-old
man said the reflection in the mirror wasn't

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.770
him and he couldn't remember any details of
his life.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.780
A little digging revealed him to be a Navy
vet and graphic designer who spent some time

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.699
teaching English abroad, though not in Sweden.

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:42.359
Though a little more digging did find him
dressed as a knight and using a Swedish name

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:43.829
on some message boards.

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:44.930
That is true.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.820
This is some legit soap opera craziness, guys.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.250
What is going on here?

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.690
It's called transient global amnesia and it's
considered a fugue state.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.219
If you watch Breaking Bad, you've probably
heard that term before.

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.940
A fugue state is basically caused by some
sort of intense mental trauma and it causes

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.650
memory loss, identity confusion, and sudden
and unplanned travel.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.620
People suffering from it can carry on normal
conversations, they're not physically impaired.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.510
It's only when someone asked them a question
about themselves that they realize they don't

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:15.750
know who they are.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.470
What's interesting is that we're not really
sure what the underlying causes of fugue states

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:21.960
are, neurologically.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.350
We do know that TGA sufferers seem to have
a history of migraines and are usually over

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.350
50.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.550
Mild head trauma can cause one, high stress
levels sudden immersion in hot or cold water,

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.640
alcohol abuse, even sexual intercourse.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.270
Sex so good or bad that you literally forget
who you are.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.090
That's pretty nuts.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.810
Transient global amnesia tends to last only
a day but fugue states can last a few months.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.320
Now Boatwright reportedly had his symptoms
since February 28, which make doctors think

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.380
he's suffering from some combination of the
two, or a new type of fugue state entirely.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.620
Or maybe he's a faker.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.920
People do that a lot too to to escape criminal
or financial trouble.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.990
But there are about twenty four legitimate
cases of this reported every year.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.849
Now the good news is that whether long or
short term, fugue states tend to go away on

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:09.849
their own.

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.959
There's no medication to speed the process
along because no one's ever pinpointed a direct

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:15.719
neurological cause for them.

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:20.370
But some patients show some underlying brain
damage that might have existed for a while.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.000
Doctors have had luck speeding recovery along
with things like art therapy and counseling.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.939
The real danger is that people who suffer
from fugue states can have larger disassociated

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:31.590
disorders later on in life.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.810
Things like dementia.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.159
So it's really important that they work with
doctors and therapists afterwards to stay

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:37.310
in good mental shape.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.519
How crazy fascinating is this?

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.769
People have lost their entire idea who they
are by being dumped in cold water.

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.599
I am hoping that they're doing some serious
observation on this guy because I would love

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:53.269
it if they could get a better idea of what
causes all this stuff.
