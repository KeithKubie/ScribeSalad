Dan Murray: Well, at WebFilings,

00:00:05.125 --> 00:00:11.125
we produce software that helps a company
to streamline their SEC reporting process.

00:00:11.125 --> 00:00:15.625
And it's been a really labor
intensive process for decades

00:00:15.625 --> 00:00:19.042
using older tools, word processors,
and spreadsheet applications.

00:00:19.042 --> 00:00:23.542
And so our product provides a web-based
word processor and spreadsheet application

00:00:23.542 --> 00:00:27.792
that really helps to shave a lot
of time off the overall process.

00:00:35.125 --> 00:00:38.292
Well, we started working with AppEngine
right after it launched in 2008.

00:00:38.292 --> 00:00:40.875
And we were really excited about cloud computing

00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:45.042
and what cloud computing was gonna
do just in general for software,

00:00:45.042 --> 00:00:46.833
engineering software development.

00:00:46.833 --> 00:00:50.708
And AppEngine really,
from the scalability perspective,

00:00:50.708 --> 00:00:53.917
we knew, we were gonna grow very quickly

00:00:53.917 --> 00:00:57.125
and we have to date grown
very fast over the past year.

00:00:57.125 --> 00:01:03.750
And we looked at Google AppEngine's ability
to scale really predictably, linearly with load.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.500
That was really important
in the beginning.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.917
We also spent time looking at Google 

00:01:07.917 --> 00:01:10.625
and looking at Google AppEngine's
approach to security,

00:01:10.625 --> 00:01:14.042
knowing that our customers really
wanted something that would be

00:01:14.042 --> 00:01:17.333
really solid from a security
standpoint and very reliable

00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:22.208
because the information that they're
producing has to be very accurate,

00:01:22.208 --> 00:01:25.667
very timely, and it also--.

00:01:25.667 --> 00:01:28.792
These companies are putting
pre-release financial information

00:01:28.792 --> 00:01:33.500
into Google's cloud in GAE
through our product.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.917
And so, you can imagine 
if that information ever got out,

00:01:36.917 --> 00:01:40.208
that it could be very, very harmful to customers.

00:01:40.208 --> 00:01:44.000
So, we've taken a really strong
approach to security ourselves,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.667
and then also just being
on the Google foundation

00:01:46.667 --> 00:01:49.292
just gives us and our customers
peace of mind.

00:01:49.292 --> 00:01:52.833
Google, with Google AppEngine's
provide a platform

00:01:52.833 --> 00:01:56.708
that takes the infrastructure
management off of our hands.

00:01:56.708 --> 00:01:58.375
We don't have to worry about it.

00:01:58.375 --> 00:02:01.458
So, it's easy for us
to build and deploy apps.

00:02:01.458 --> 00:02:03.417
And for us right now, 

00:02:03.417 --> 00:02:08.333
it's about execution and making sure
that we're scaling our business,

00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:12.792
while AppEngine provides the ability
to scale technology and platform.

00:02:12.792 --> 00:02:16.667
So the future for us is really
how do we evolve the product

00:02:16.667 --> 00:02:22.750
and find new ways to help our customers
save time in areas of financial reporting?
