00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.170
&gt;&gt; Charles, I lied.

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:01.710
&gt;&gt; No!

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.170
&gt;&gt; I'm so sorry. In fact, it turns out

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:06.700
that there is no tweak that you could do to

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.018
these algorithms to make the trifecta, to have all

00:00:10.018 --> 00:00:13.200
3of these properties. And, in fact, there is no clustering

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.079
algorithm. It is impossible to derive a clustering algorithm

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.540
that has these 3 properties. So this is proven by

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.460
Kleinberg, and what he showed is that, once you

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:22.950
define these 3 different properties,

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.110
richness, scale invariance, and consistency,

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.070
they are mutually contradictory in a sense. So, just like we saw

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.010
in the example that we went through in the quiz, where we tweak

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.784
the algorithm and it gets us one but it loses another, that's

00:00:35.784 --> 00:00:39.970
a necessary property. You just can't have all these 3 hold at once.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.470
&gt;&gt; That's pretty surprising coming from Kleinberg, because John is

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.490
one of the nicest people I know in machine learning and

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.260
theory, and you would think that he would have tried to

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.570
find a possibility theorem, not an impossibility theorem. I'm very disappointed.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:50.210
&gt;&gt; See, he's got a dark

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.120
side, is what I'm saying. This is a striking and

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.360
maybe even upsetting result, right? It's saying that, if you

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.030
actually sit down and say, well, here's what I would

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.840
like my clustering algorithm to be, which people hadn't really

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.690
done very often, once you've bothered to go do all

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.570
that hard work of saying what matters to you and

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.370
what doesn't matter to you, it turns out you can't

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.780
have what you want. You can't always have what you want.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.160
&gt;&gt; But, can you get what you need?

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.050
&gt;&gt; In this particular case,

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.277
maybe. It depends if you only need 2 of these. [LAUGH]

00:01:18.277 --> 00:01:21.300
&gt;&gt; Well, so how bad is this? So, so, so, I agree, it is, it is

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.040
a at least to me, a surprising result that you can't have all 3 of them.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.620
And it's a little disappointing because you'd love

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.500
to have an algorithm that does. Because, I

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.030
think we agree, all 3 of these properties

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.900
makes sense. At least, certainly, independently they do.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:33.400
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.165
&gt;&gt; But just how bad is it? I mean when, when you can't have all

00:01:36.165 --> 00:01:39.648
3, can you come close to having all 3? Can you have like 2.9 of them?

00:01:39.648 --> 00:01:40.107
[LAUGH]

00:01:40.107 --> 00:01:41.560
&gt;&gt; Well, you can definitely have two of

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.296
them, because that's what we did in the quiz.

00:01:43.296 --> 00:01:43.638
&gt;&gt; hm.

00:01:43.638 --> 00:01:45.370
&gt;&gt; Well, it kind of depends on what, you

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.235
can reinterpret some of these properties and get, and nearly

00:01:48.235 --> 00:01:50.750
satisfy them. And I can point you to Kleinberg's

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.340
paper to look into that. But I think I need

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.454
to be done with this for now. I just

00:01:53.454 --> 00:01:56.060
wantedto give you a flavor of the idea that, one

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.320
of the reasons that clustering is hard to pin down

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.340
is because when you pin it down, it plays dead.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.140
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.560
&gt;&gt; It's like a, it's like an opossum. When you pin it down, it actually

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.870
it turns out that it still doesn't really want to do what you

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.940
want it to do. But in practice, what happens is people do clustering

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.120
for lots of different reasons. And

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.890
they're willing to change their clustering, like,

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.040
look at what actually comes out of it, and change their notion of

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.710
clustering so that it's more consistent

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.270
with what they're trying to achieve. It's

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.490
not great to use in this purely automated fashion, where you just hand

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.850
it over to the computer and be done with it. But it's still

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.290
a really powerful thing to do to get to know your data better.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.000
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.110
I accept that. I feel better now.
