TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan,

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.053
and this is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:04.053 --> 00:00:05.910
from Google in the last week.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.530
Bring voice control, natural
language understanding, Google

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.980
Smarts, and more to your devices
using the Google Assistant SDK.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.300
The developer preview
is now available.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.910
Get the sample code and
videos from the post linked

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.100
in the description below.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.390
Businesses that use the
Google My Business API

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.120
can now publish their
entire menu to Google.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.380
Itemized with descriptions,
photos, and prices, making it

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.480
frictionless for their customers
to view their menus on Google.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.530
Screenshots and sample
code are on the post.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.590
Quizzes and Google Forms help
teachers automate testing

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.840
and get feedback
to students faster

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.900
by having forms check responses
against correct answers

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.890
automatically.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.140
And now you can create these
quizzes programmatically

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.250
with app script.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.370
Screenshots and code
are on the post.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.410
Beginning in
October 2017, Chrome

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.910
will show the not secure
warning in two more situations--

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.280
when users enter data on an
HTTP page and on all HTTP pages

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.356
visited in incognito mode.

00:01:04.356 --> 00:01:05.730
Which makes it a
good time for me

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.450
to say HTTPS is easier and
cheaper than ever before.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.435
And it enables both best
performance the web offers

00:01:12.435 --> 00:01:16.740
and powerful new features that
are too sensitive for HTTP.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.990
Check out our setup
guides to get started.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.420
Everything's linked
from the post.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.510
You can now define
and run a GRPC API

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.380
and serve both GRPC
and JSON HTTP 1.1

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.380
to your clients using
Google Cloud Endpoints.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.720
More details are on the post
linked in the description

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.870
below.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.100
Please like and share.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.763
