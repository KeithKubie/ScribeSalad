00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.870
In R we can create models using the lm function. We need to

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.420
supply a formula in the form of y~x.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.180
Here, y is the outcome variable and x is the explanatory

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:19.785
variable. Which of the following formulas would we use inside the lm function?

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:25.740
Price~^. Price to the cube root ~log^

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:33.983
log price ~^ carat to the third, log price ~^ to the 1 3rd, select one.
