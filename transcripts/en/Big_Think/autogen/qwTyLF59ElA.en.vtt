00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:10.940
When you think about romance and sweethearts
and spouses, one of the most striking observations

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:17.140
from the research – it's sad, but it's true
– is that, often, married couples will treat

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:23.560
each other with less consideration than they
show to their friends, or even to strangers.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.949
And when I read this, I thought, oh my gosh,
can that be true?

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.280
And I realized, of course it's true, because
the people that we're married to are so familiar

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.970
to us, they are so close to us; they are really
part of our lives, and it's very easy to take

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:45.700
them for granted or to make them the brunt
of a bad mood or a short temper, and to forget

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:52.730
to use our consideration, our good manners,
our gentle language.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.460
And so one of the things that I remind myself
of all the time is that I want to show as

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.100
much consideration to my husband as I would
to any passing stranger or friend.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.860
And I also try to remind myself to show my
husband as much or more affection as my dog,

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.040
because when my husband comes and goes from
the apartment, I want to give him a real hello

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.040
and a real goodbye.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.830
I want to give him a kiss and a hug and really
look him in the eye and say that I'm glad

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:19.830
to see him.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.430
If my dog can do it, I can do it.
