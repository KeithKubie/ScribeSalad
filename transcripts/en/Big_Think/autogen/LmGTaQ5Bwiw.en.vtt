00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.510
we do see some some effects of that and

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:06.520
we do see some some effects of that and
 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.180
we do see some some effects of that and
and that's very visible in in some of

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:09.190
and that's very visible in in some of
 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:10.829
and that's very visible in in some of
the economies that have grown extremely

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:10.839
the economies that have grown extremely
 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:13.829
the economies that have grown extremely
fast over the last two or three decades

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:13.839
fast over the last two or three decades
 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:16.380
fast over the last two or three decades
and what you find is a countries that

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:16.390
and what you find is a countries that
 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.580
and what you find is a countries that
used to not be extremely rich 20 30 40

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.590
used to not be extremely rich 20 30 40
 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.370
used to not be extremely rich 20 30 40
years ago they have huge gaps in terms

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380
years ago they have huge gaps in terms
 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.310
years ago they have huge gaps in terms
of literacy rates still and yet when you

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320
of literacy rates still and yet when you
 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.870
of literacy rates still and yet when you
look at today's current enrollment

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880
look at today's current enrollment
 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.610
look at today's current enrollment
grades for example for primary secondary

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:29.620
grades for example for primary secondary
 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.209
grades for example for primary secondary
tertiary education not only are women

00:00:33.209 --> 00:00:33.219
tertiary education not only are women
 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:35.040
tertiary education not only are women
and men equal but in many cases women

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050
and men equal but in many cases women
 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.060
and men equal but in many cases women
are there's greater enrollment for women

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070
are there's greater enrollment for women
 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.279
are there's greater enrollment for women
than for men and essentially what's

00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:41.289
than for men and essentially what's
 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:43.079
than for men and essentially what's
that's showing and then just maybe one

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:43.089
that's showing and then just maybe one
 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:45.450
that's showing and then just maybe one
generation and sometimes two generations

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460
generation and sometimes two generations
 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.239
generation and sometimes two generations
you've got a remarkable differences in

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:48.249
you've got a remarkable differences in
 

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:49.709
you've got a remarkable differences in
terms of the level of education that

00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:49.719
terms of the level of education that
 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:53.240
terms of the level of education that
women are receiving

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250
 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.959
different effects for different

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:54.969
different effects for different
 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:57.119
different effects for different
countries so we're covering 134

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129
countries so we're covering 134
 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:59.310
countries so we're covering 134
countries and not only are there

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320
countries and not only are there
 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.360
countries and not only are there
different effects for different

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370
different effects for different
 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.729
different effects for different
countries but very different effects for

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739
countries but very different effects for
 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.070
countries but very different effects for
different segments of society and so

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080
different segments of society and so
 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.410
different segments of society and so
while for a certain segment of society

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420
while for a certain segment of society
 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.899
while for a certain segment of society
the the idea of a man session may be

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909
the the idea of a man session may be
 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.080
the the idea of a man session may be
true it's not true for four other parts

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090
true it's not true for four other parts
 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.210
true it's not true for four other parts
of society and so it's it's going to

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220
of society and so it's it's going to
 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.249
of society and so it's it's going to
have very very different effects I think

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259
have very very different effects I think
 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:18.870
have very very different effects I think
one of the most probably the most

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880
one of the most probably the most
 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.600
one of the most probably the most
worrying effects is the the fact that

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610
worrying effects is the the fact that
 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.969
worrying effects is the the fact that
there will be less to go around in terms

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979
there will be less to go around in terms
 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.060
there will be less to go around in terms
of resources and that can be attributed

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070
of resources and that can be attributed
 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.600
of resources and that can be attributed
to girls and women's education and

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610
to girls and women's education and
 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.029
to girls and women's education and
empowerment and certainly when we think

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039
empowerment and certainly when we think
 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:34.919
empowerment and certainly when we think
about if we've got less resources and

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:34.929
about if we've got less resources and
 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:36.389
about if we've got less resources and
we've got to think just a little bit

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399
we've got to think just a little bit
 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:37.859
we've got to think just a little bit
harder about what would be the most

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869
harder about what would be the most
 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.870
harder about what would be the most
effective way of investing those

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880
effective way of investing those
 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.300
effective way of investing those
resources and it really does come down

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310
resources and it really does come down
 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.310
resources and it really does come down
to girls education and investing in that

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320
to girls education and investing in that
 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.169
to girls education and investing in that
because it has enormous multiplier

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179
because it has enormous multiplier
 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:48.659
because it has enormous multiplier
effects
