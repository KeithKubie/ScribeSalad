00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.990
A statistician for
a basketball team

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:04.800
tracked the number
of points that each

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.600
of the 12 players on the
team had in one game.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.010
And then made a stem-and-leaf
plot to show the data.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.040
And sometimes it's
called a stem-plot.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.102
How many points
did the team score?

00:00:16.102 --> 00:00:18.310
And when you first look at
this plot right over here,

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:19.950
it seems a little
hard to understand.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.444
Understand we have
0, 1, 2 under leaf

00:00:22.444 --> 00:00:23.860
you have all of
these digits here.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.190
How does this relate
to the number of points

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.260
each student, or each
player, actually scored?

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.750
And the way to interpret
a stem-and-leaf plot

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.910
is the leafs contain--
at least the way

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.470
that this statistician used it--
the leaf contains the smallest

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.400
digit, or the ones digit,
in the number of points

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.860
that each player scored.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.250
And the stem contains
the tens digits.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.870
And usually the leaf will
contain the rightmost digit,

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.700
or the ones digit,
and then the stem

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.840
will contain all of
the other digits.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.480
And what's useful
about this is it

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.070
gives kind of a distribution
of where the players were.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.310
You see that most of
the players scored

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.440
points that started with a 0.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.209
Then a few more scored
points that started with a 1.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:07.980
And then only one score scored
points to started with a 2,

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.450
and it was actually 20 points.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.977
So I'm going to actually
write down all of this data

00:01:11.977 --> 00:01:13.810
in a way that maybe
you're a little bit more

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.420
used to understanding it.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.920
So I'm going to write
the 0's in purple.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.020
So there's, let's see, 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 players

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.070
had 0 as the first digit.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.462
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.040
I wrote seven 0's.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.090
And then this player also
had a 0 in his ones digit.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.800
This player, I'm going to
try to do all the colors,

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.600
this player also had
a 0 in his ones digit.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.220
This player right here
had a 2 in his ones digit,

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.710
so he scored a
total of 2 points.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.793
This player, let me
do orange, this player

00:01:51.793 --> 00:01:54.330
had 4 for his ones digit.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.580
This player had 7
for his ones digit.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.480
Then this player had
7 for his ones digit.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.960
And then, let me see, I'm
almost using all the colors,

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.530
this player had 9
for his ones digit.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.460
So the way to read this is, you
had one player with 0 points.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.850
0, 2, 4, 7, 9 and 9.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.870
But you can see, and
it's kind of silly

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.407
saying the zero
was a tens digit,

00:02:18.407 --> 00:02:19.990
you could have even
put a blank there.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.615
But the 0 lets us
know that they didn't

00:02:21.615 --> 00:02:24.700
score anything in
the tens place.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.940
But these are the actual
scores for those seven players.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.700
Now let's go to the next row
in the stem-and-leaf plot.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.060
So over here, all of
the digits start with,

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.760
or all of the points start with
1, for each of the players.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.940
And there's four of them.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.710
So 1, 1, 1, and 1.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.600
And then we have this
player over here,

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.250
his ones digit, or her
ones digit, is a 1.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.090
So this player,
this represents 11.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.150
1 in the tens place,
1 in the ones place.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.370
This player over
here also got 11.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.770
1 in the tens place,
1 in the ones place.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.080
This player, let me
do orange, this player

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.350
has 3 in the ones place.

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.250
So he or she scored 13 points.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.070
1 in the tens place,
3 in the ones place.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.770
13 points.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.020
And then I will
do this in purple.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.760
This player has 8
in their ones place.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.160
So he or she scored 18 points.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.710
1 in the tens place,
8 in the ones place.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.190
18 points.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.390
And then finally,
you have this player

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.220
that has the tens digit is a 2.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.296
And then the ones digit is a 0.

00:03:37.296 --> 00:03:38.420
I'll circle that in yellow.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.160
It is a 0.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.030
So he or she scored 20 points.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.370
So looking at the
stem-and-leaf plot,

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.179
we were able to extract out
all of the number of points

00:03:48.179 --> 00:03:49.470
that all of the players scored.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.261
And once again, what
was useful about this,

00:03:51.261 --> 00:03:54.110
is you see how many players
scored between 0 and 9 points,

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.700
including 9 points.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.210
How many scored between
10 and 19 points,

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.450
and then how many scored
20 points or over.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.620
And you see the distribution
right over here.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.360
But let's actually
answer the question

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.360
that they're asking
us to answer.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.190
How many points
did the team score?

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.920
So here we just
have to add up all

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.530
of these numbers
right over here.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.230
So we're going to add up, I'll
start with the largest, so 20

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:27.120
plus 18 plus 13 plus 11 plus
11-- 13, 11, 11-- plus 9 plus 7

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:33.177
plus 7 again plus 4 plus 2.

00:04:33.177 --> 00:04:34.010
Did I do that right?

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.570
We have two 11's, then a 9,
then two 7's, then a 4 then a 2,

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.770
and then these two characters
didn't score anything.

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.353
So let's add up all
of these together.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:53.110
So 0 plus 8 is 8, plus 3 is
11, plus 1 is 12, plus 1 is 13,

00:04:53.110 --> 00:05:03.490
plus 9 is 22, plus
7 is 27, 34, 38, 40.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.060
So that gets us to 40.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.590
Let me do that one more time.

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:22.232
8, 11, 11, 12, 13, 22, 29, 29,
and then 29, 36, 40, and 42.

00:05:22.232 --> 00:05:23.940
Looks like I actually
might have messed--

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.148
let me do that one more time.

00:05:25.148 --> 00:05:27.030
This is the hardest
part, adding these up.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.404
So let me try that
one last time.

00:05:28.404 --> 00:05:30.280
I'm just going to
state where my sum is.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:40.660
So 0, 8, add 3, 11, 12,
13, 22, 29, 36, 40, 42.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.660
So it's a good thing that
I double checked that.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.720
I made a mistake the first time.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.490
4 plus 2 is 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.200
So we get to 102 points.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:57.540
The team, in total,
scored 102 points.
