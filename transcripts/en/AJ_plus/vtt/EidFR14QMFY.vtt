00:08:55.040 --> 00:09:01.100
When I talked about these institutions in place, these structures that are in place that the undergirds and

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:53.040
We're going to continue doing what we're doing, and that is to enforce the law and be fair about it,

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.040
and that's all we can do.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:08:02.000
person is receiving help. We are yet to
find anything like that, and we've looked.

00:07:38.169 --> 00:07:43.419
parasites, primarily hookworm – something most experts assumed had disappeared in

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:50.300
the U.S. The Alabama state health department refuses to acknowledge the validity of the test results.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:07.660
supports poverty. And until we change that, it doesn't matter who the face of it is. Or who's in charge.

00:07:29.169 --> 00:07:33.430
sanitation. Catherine and a team of
researchers from the Baylor College of

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:29.169
more alarming: the resurgence of
parasitic disease linked to poor

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:38.260
and it's leaking water right now. So I have to squeeze the clothes out and hang them

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:44.560
up in the house before they got something to wear to school.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:31.620
And I got holes everywhere in my house. And mold and stuff. My washer was torn up

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:24.360
The house ain’t fit to live in, because animals and stuff come inside my house. Possums and stuff.

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:15.320
trying to pretend like this problem does not exist.

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:12.420
The unfortunate part is that the government should be partnering with us on finding real solutions instead of

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.540
There is no evidence of hookworms in Alabama.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:54.740
We are yet to find a person, a person's name,

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:38.169
Medicine conducted a study that found
two in five participants had intestinal

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:08.050
sanitation in the cities, where there is
sanitation or a large municipal system,

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:53.340
and terror inflicted on black people by
white residents who wanted to maintain segregation.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:24.180
These inequalities – spatial, racial, income and property – intersect with something even

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.490
Montgomery to honor the thousands killed in lynchings across the U.S.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.930
Lowndes County. A memorial was just
raised a 20-minute drive away in

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:33.940
and plantation power. The Equal Justice
Initiative documented 14 lynchings in

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:14.040
of slavery, racism and segregation cannot
be separated from the current situation.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:08.620
in the U.S. lack access to proper
sanitation. Catherine believes the legacy

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.340
I have no way to take care of this problem myself.

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:03.430
of low-income rural communities across
America. Nearly half a million households

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:45.460
decide what to do. Period. It's our of our hands.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.920
toilet, but also the safe collection,
management and disposal of feces in wastewater.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:29.320
In 2015, the UN said access to sanitation is a human right. That requires not only access to a

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:11.020
that criminalize it? It's saying that you've broken the law. That's not a

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.340
We still write notice of
violation. I don't know why people call

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:43.699
by her department. In recent years, the
department has stopped taking people in

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:55.600
misdemeanor and fine. Sherry says the
department's role in all of this is only regulatory.

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:17.800
in the areas of town where black people
have traditionally lived.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:14.229
it generally stops at where the black
community starts, or people have problems

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:02.380
changed and there are black elected
officials in place now, you see where the

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.480
Against the backdrop of all of that, Lowndes County has, although it has

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:47.080
In the 1950s, it earned the nickname
"Bloody Lowndes" because of the violence

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.740
The history of this
area is entrenched in white supremacy

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:25.460
institutional racism is still in place, and that's one of the reasons why we have these problems.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:19.510
The institutions were set up based on
racism, and in some cases, I think that

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:56.880
Lowndes County is just one piece of a larger picture that shows a pattern of neglect and marginalization

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.430
If the person refuses to put
in a system, it goes to court. The judge

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.580
and the use of septic tank systems. We
don't criminalize anybody.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:17.620
strategy, that's that's what we do. We
regulate the permitting, the installation

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:05.470
it "criminalizing."
When you get a ticket for speeding, does

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:48.169
this county to court, but it continues to
cite homeowners, which could lead to a

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.659
arrest warrants in Lowndes County for
septic-system violations brought forward

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.600
Cheri Bradley is the director of environmental services

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:16.420
anywhere from $6,000 to $30,000. The annual per capita income here is $18,000.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.060
the ones often needed to handle
the soil in Lowndes County can cost

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:55.099
particles and microbes filter out
bacteria. But in hard, clay soil, water

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:39.480
ground is good for planting, but it's not
good for on-site wastewater treatment.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.040
Here's the reason. Most on-site septic
systems rely primarily on the soil

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.760
soils of the Carolinas, and the
of Alabama decided that they wanted to

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.530
expand and put their plantations and
bring their slaves here. And the people

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.740
But it also earned the nickname because
of its rich, dense clay soil.

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.790
to put the infrastructure in place to
keep the population poor. And a lot of

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.310
these populations are largely people of color.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.660
to provide our own water. People had
their own wells. And then when the USDA

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.710
County is environmental racism. When we first moved to Lowndes County in the 1960s, we had

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:35.210
at the Alabama Health Department. Between 1996 and 2001, 24 people were issued

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:25.580
United States. You're talking about
poverty. That's not for the health department to fix.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.660
Yes, Lowndes County – and I
agree – is the poorest county in the

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.100
So while an ordinary septic tank might
cost between $5,000 and $10,000,

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:59.599
can't really move. And that means
wastewater can't be filtered properly.

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:49.489
itself to treat wastewater. The effluent
flows out of drain holes, where soil

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.629
those slaves that were brought to this
area to work the ground. Because the

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.459
that are in Lowndes County, a lot of us –
including myself – are descendants of

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.310
and settled this area. They came
here because that they had worn out the

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.280
Our soils were the reason that people came here in the first place

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.130
Belt." That's because the majority of the
population is made up of black Americans.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.570
Lowndes County sits in the middle of a
region in Alabama known as the "Black

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.130
sanitation part. So as a result, a lot of
these areas intentionally were, I think ...

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.510
started providing water to families in
rural communities, they left out the

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.350
victims of benign neglect. You know, the
lack of investment in those communities

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.280
A lot of what is happening in Lowndes

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.980
find a solution to the sanitation crisis.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.620
Catherine Coleman-Flowers grew up in Lowndes County, and has spent the last 16 years trying to

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.580
Yes, I called this America's dirty secret. And I think that this is a problem that has gone on for years.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:47.820
It make me feel bad. Because I don’t want all my stuff just coming out here and running on the ground.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.890
get rid of their own waste. And with
nearly a third of the community living

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.120
I have no septic system, m-hmm.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.340
Because you have no septic ...

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.460
people. Behind her mobile home is a pool
of human excrement. That's because she

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.840
Why can’t you flush the toilet paper down?

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.130
that people don't have access to
sanitation. Pamela Rush is one of those

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:53.500
the civil rights movement are still
being denied access to basic human rights.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:32.410
March of 1965, ended in horrific violence.
Months later, the Voting Rights Act was

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.120
What started out as a peaceful protest
from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, in

00:09:11.709 --> 00:09:17.140
things change, we're going to continue to
create what we've created.

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:11.709
It could be somebody who looks like me.
It doesn't matter. Until these structural

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.440
facility. An estimated 80% of
residents have to pay out of pocket to

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:07.520
below the poverty line, people like Pamela have resorted to straight-piping into fields, yards and ditches.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.780
Many homes in Lowndes County are too
scattered for a central wastewater

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.760
What’s that feel like?

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.280
Because it will get stopped up. The line and stuff get stopped up.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.380
has a straight pipe going directly from
her toilet into the backyard.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.249
an area of extreme rural poverty, where
families who live in the epicenter of

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.699
There are parts of Lowndes County,
Alabama, so impoverished and neglected

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.420
follow that same trail today, from Selma
to Montgomery on Highway 80, you'll find

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.350
passed. Black Americans are now
guaranteed the right to vote, but if you

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:17.900
We are going to walk nonviolently and peacefully, to let the nation know we are tired now.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.780
Black Americans paid for the right to
vote with blood and bruises.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:29.560
Ain’t nothing I can do. I can pray, 'cause I don’t have nothing.
