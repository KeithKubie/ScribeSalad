Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. You got spidey sense, man. Got It. So one of the most humbling things about getting older is the vision going. Oh yeah. Okay. I've known like from when I was like 42 I started to notice it and by the time I was 46 I was like, God damn. And I think I need glasses because I would just try to like read the computer and I'd be doing this with my eyes, like bulging my eyes and squinting and trying to look at it sideways and try and see what the fuck I was ready. It's a weird thing. It's like, oh boy. My ability to see the world is fading. It happens. Yeah. It was to the best of this, but it's a warning sign like, hey man, this is, you know, this is a finite existence. Yeah. Oh, get some shit done right now.

Speaker 1:          00:45          Right now. Don't wait. It's going to be waiting time. It sets a precious commodity. Billionaires, you can not buy one second nine oh one second of life. Yeah. Can't do it. Nope. It's whole price. Anything that you're thinking about doing and you've been putting off? My advice is big. Get step and get to next year. Right now we get after it. Don't put it off any longer. Get it done. So do you feel like you're like CT Fletcher 2.0 definitely. I'm a new dude. I knew dude with a new attitude. Yeah. Yeah. Big Time. Oh boy. You won't be arguing at Taylor. The guys I used to argue with online, Hey, I love you man. You can hate me all you want to. I love to see I ain't got time for hate. Yeah. Racism or a big, I got time for none of that. It's all foolish and I said, it's so much bullshit and just a waste of time and ain't even fighting.

Speaker 1:          01:47          Yeah. I'm like, look, if the in the transplant experience enhanced my view, I've always said, we were all saying I need a bar. My mom taught me love everybody, but look, they took, I have no idea the nationality or race up the donor, it don't matter. I hope you're right. If you're right, it's an Asian woman. I think that would be fantastic. Then you could feel that, that you would know that and you could feel it. Man, we that be something to be amazing. I got to find out. How can you find out? I, I don't, I have no idea. I want that. Hopefully they're listening to the Joe Rogan podcast.
