1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:01,853
Okay.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:03,560
Eh,

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,890
will Harris your live man, this is great.

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,760
You're on the other side of the camera.

5
00:00:07,761 --> 00:00:11,000
Now let me give you an introduction
for people who don't know.

6
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,670
Will is the man behind the
anatomy of the fighter,

7
00:00:13,671 --> 00:00:16,520
if you ever seen any of those videos,

8
00:00:16,521 --> 00:00:20,990
like particularly the most famous one
was when Conor McGregor threw that Dolly

9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,370
at the bus with Khabib.

10
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,400
NEUROMAG Madoff was on it and it
became a huge part of the promotion,

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,050
which I thought was weird that
it was this shameful act, right?

12
00:00:30,051 --> 00:00:30,741
That he did that.

13
00:00:30,741 --> 00:00:35,600
I mean really awful caught a bunch of
innocent people that were on the bus but

14
00:00:35,601 --> 00:00:38,510
they use it over and over and
over again. That was your footage.

15
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:40,580
A lot of people didn't
even know it, including me.

16
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,390
No one did. Um, you know, I was telling
a friend of the day, what's funny,

17
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,450
no one has ever heard this.
But when it happened, uh,

18
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,960
I show it could be at the
back of the bus cause he was,

19
00:00:50,961 --> 00:00:54,830
had a smile on his face and I showed
him and everybody else on the bus that I

20
00:00:54,831 --> 00:00:57,770
actually caught condor doing it. Cause
they didn't really know it was Connor.

21
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,770
So I remember it could
be looked at the footage.

22
00:01:00,771 --> 00:01:05,330
I was holding the camera and he was like,
brother, you can get paid from this.

23
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:09,260
It's like, Bro, this is worth $100,000.
He looked at his manager, Ali,

24
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,070
a shout out to Ali and he was like,
get this, get him, give him some money.

25
00:01:13,071 --> 00:01:17,840
He deserves this. And then I gave it
to the UFC to use for embedded and um,

26
00:01:17,841 --> 00:01:18,380
I thought it,

27
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:22,280
that was just sit and they promoted
the fight with it and I was like, damn,

28
00:01:22,281 --> 00:01:25,550
I should've just leaned my head to the
right and got hit by the Dolly so I could

29
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,030
not have to be doing a, you
know, a go fund me's and Shit.

30
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,130
Well, what you should have
done is asked for money for it.

31
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,300
That video footage was,

32
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,350
it turned out it was very valuable
because it set up the fight,

33
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,950
which also set up the post-fight
brawl. I mean there was,

34
00:01:40,951 --> 00:01:45,510
there was so much that was involved in
him throwing that Dolly and you caught

35
00:01:45,511 --> 00:01:48,300
that video. They played that
shit over and over and over.

36
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,470
I was actually kind of shocked that they
did that because at the time we were

37
00:01:52,471 --> 00:01:56,310
like, whoa, Connor might go to jail. That
was, that was like legitimate assault.

38
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:59,640
They use it the next day.
I'm like, I was like, damn,

39
00:01:59,641 --> 00:02:02,310
like WME is when I saw it on like, um,

40
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,050
when I saw it on Fox News and CNN,
I was just like, that's my footage.

41
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,380
You know. Cause you know,
when you build in a,

42
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,440
like a channel or a series like that,
you think, oh, this is my moment. Every,

43
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,880
everybody has a moment.

44
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:20,330
And unfortunately the UFC promoted it and
shout out to them because they've been

45
00:02:20,701 --> 00:02:23,370
nothing but good to me.
I can't say anything. Uh,

46
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,890
I still wish I would've got shot
in front of you should've got it.

47
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,650
Some friends put, pull this mic up,
but just pull it, just get it up there.

48
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,390
This from your face. There you go.
Right there. Right there. Yeah. No,

49
00:02:31,391 --> 00:02:35,620
you do a fantastic job. I mean,
you really do. And I, like I said,

50
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,960
until that video footage came out,

51
00:02:37,961 --> 00:02:41,080
I didn't know that you weren't even
a part of the UFC promotion team.

52
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,100
I didn't know.

53
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,820
I thought maybe WME had hired you and
this was another thing that they're

54
00:02:45,821 --> 00:02:47,680
working on. I did not know
that you were independent.

55
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,740
Well, what was crazy is that I
started at almost two years ago, um,

56
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:56,160
I was just sitting at home in Florida.
I was living in south Florida and I was,

57
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:59,560
I was hanging out with the guys
at the black zillions at Jocko.

58
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,270
I had stumbled over there one day at
the gym and I seen it when I was grocery

59
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:08,290
shopping and I just stopped in and I
was doing stuff for Shannon Briggs.

60
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,430
Let's go champ, let's go
chill. I was just going yet,

61
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,960
I was going to the a heavyweight factory.
You would, hey, you do all those.

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,360
I said, no, I wasn't
doing this phone videos.

63
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,080
What happened was I reached out to him
and he invited me to the heavyweight

64
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:22,240
factory. Holyfield Phil was there.

65
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:26,440
Everybody and I just went there a few
times and I created some creative videos

66
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:30,660
for them to working out. He was,
when I was there, I seen him.

67
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,220
He still looks good. He does
man. He like what? Crazy.

68
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,860
He's like 50 something years
old. He's 50 years. I got some,

69
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:40,600
I got some amazing stories about like
that I've never released about Tyson fight

70
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,460
like crazy things like his, his,
oh man, I got some stuff. Yeah.

71
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,390
Well initially anatomy, if it was
just supposed to be a documentary,

72
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,540
that was it. And I was that was it
just an hour long documentary? Um,

73
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:59,920
I never knew who it could be was
and nothing like I just didn't know.

74
00:03:59,921 --> 00:04:03,850
I knew Michael Johnson, all these guys
because they was at the black zillion.

75
00:04:03,851 --> 00:04:07,150
So I knew the first day I ever went
in the gym like Michael Chandler,

76
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,170
C'mon ooze mind. Shout out
to Kumar, who's my, cause I,

77
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:13,210
the first time I ever saw him
I thought he was a bum. What?

78
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,990
Cause Michael Cherrella gave it to him
and I got it on camera and I thought the

79
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:19,870
Chandler was the stud. Right.
And then they was like, oh,

80
00:04:19,871 --> 00:04:24,340
he won the ultimate fighter, things like
that. So that was almost two years ago.

81
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:28,150
You thought he was a bum? Yeah,
just cause I saw the day in the gym,

82
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:31,000
it was sparring, it was just
sparring. So I'm, you know,

83
00:04:31,001 --> 00:04:34,090
I'm going around filming people and
then I just turned to the cage and like

84
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:36,340
Michael [inaudible] just dropped
them with like a low shot.

85
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:38,200
And then Michael Chandler
like walking around them,

86
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,200
like I created this film called
the portrait of the black zillions.

87
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:45,340
That was like the first thing I ever
made because it was Glenn Robinson rip to

88
00:04:45,341 --> 00:04:49,270
him and Tyrone Spong that
really pushed me to do MMA.

89
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,260
They saw the stuff that I did with
Shannon bricks and they called me into the

90
00:04:53,261 --> 00:04:54,780
office that same day that I,

91
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:59,800
I gave whoever the manager was at Jocko
to the footage and Glen just said,

92
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:04,420
listen, we need this type of work in
MMA. Like this is high quality stuff.

93
00:05:04,421 --> 00:05:09,150
And Tyrone spawn was boxing. So I
knew he was probably loving, uh, the,

94
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,700
the footage with Shannon bridge cause he,

95
00:05:10,701 --> 00:05:14,020
he in boxing and that's after he broke
his leg against [inaudible] Saki and he

96
00:05:14,021 --> 00:05:17,470
decided to just go straight to box. So
he, you know, Tyrone, he's very, uh,

97
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:21,430
persuasive and he was like, Hey,
this, we need this in the gym.

98
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:26,431
So they gave me a pass to go to a sparring
date and really work out with them.

99
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:32,110
And, um, yeah, there it is right there.
But uh, yeah, that's how it happened.

100
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,940
And I just kept going to the gym every
day, put that back up chest and that,

101
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,080
okay. Yeah,

102
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:42,100
that's the first thing I ever filmed in
my life called the portrait of the black

103
00:05:42,101 --> 00:05:47,050
zillions. And that shot of a Michael
Chandler, a RP to Jordan Parsons,

104
00:05:47,051 --> 00:05:50,930
that was a fighter that, you know,
died after getting hit by a car. Um,

105
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,620
but that's the first thing I
ever found for anatomy of fire.

106
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,790
That was the sparring match.
And, um, yeah, that was it.

107
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:01,560
And from there, uh,
everything was born. Um,

108
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,210
I still was like focusing on
doing like a documentary, um,

109
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,000
until I moved to Vegas. Uh,

110
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,360
like a summer after that during a condom
of Gregor in a Floyd Mayweather fight.

111
00:06:11,361 --> 00:06:11,810
I just wanted to,

112
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:15,410
I felt like I needed to move to Vegas
cause the energy was taking me there and I

113
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:16,050
felt like, ah,

114
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,710
if I'm going to do a documentary I
might as well be a Vegas where a lot of

115
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,240
fighters is. This is a
giant shift for you. Right.

116
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,180
So like what were you filming before?

117
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,510
Two years ago when you were at the
Black Zillions? Uh, before that,

118
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,420
like I have a wedding business,
so I was doing weddings.

119
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,780
My big black ass is doing
weddings, which is funny.

120
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,550
I go to these weddings
and people would be like,

121
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,280
cause we'll sit down
was gigantic six, five.

122
00:06:37,281 --> 00:06:41,620
So he's towered over all of these
people, little in their wedding. I,

123
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,710
I really thought like, man, my life
is miserable. At one point I was like,

124
00:06:45,711 --> 00:06:49,710
I'm just shooting these a, yeah,
after a while, like you win or award,

125
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:53,000
then another ward in another ward and
it's all based off reviews. Right.

126
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:57,290
And it was like, man, I gotta I
gotta do something more than this.

127
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:00,200
So I did like basketball
documentaries in Italy. I live,

128
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,510
I lived in Italy for a
minute. I went to China,

129
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,320
did a basketball document Mentari there
because that's my background basketball.

130
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:09,230
But after that I was just like,
man, what, what else can I do?

131
00:07:09,231 --> 00:07:13,130
And I literally just stumbled. I saw
the gym one day Jocko. And I was like,

132
00:07:13,131 --> 00:07:14,570
that's where dumb black, zillions train.

133
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,840
And I went over there and
that's how all of this started.

134
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,920
Didn't know martial
arts training, nothing.

135
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:23,690
I just saw the gym and I was like Das
Jocko. I know the black zillions trainer.

136
00:07:23,691 --> 00:07:26,720
So I went in there like mid day, nobody
was in there. And I just said, listen,

137
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:29,840
I'm a filmmaker. I would love
to film some of these fighters.

138
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,720
And that's cool for that. Yeah.

139
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:36,590
So I went to college and University of
Southern Indiana and Evansville on a

140
00:07:36,591 --> 00:07:37,610
basketball scholarship.

141
00:07:37,611 --> 00:07:42,611
I was a top senior in America coming out
of high school and I went to this top

142
00:07:43,431 --> 00:07:48,431
division two school after I tried to
wait my senior year to get some division

143
00:07:48,831 --> 00:07:49,664
one offers.

144
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,750
If people know like division one is
the top level of basketball and then

145
00:07:53,751 --> 00:07:57,440
division two is right under that.
Probably not now, but back then it was,

146
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:01,310
and um, I went, uh,
Bruce Perl was my coach.

147
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:04,060
He was very persuasive to get me
to come to the university. He,

148
00:08:04,061 --> 00:08:06,000
he coaches at Auburn now. Uh,

149
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,480
they just went to the final four
this year if you know anything about

150
00:08:08,481 --> 00:08:12,440
basketball. But I played my first year
and then going into my second year,

151
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:17,270
I tore my ACL and uh, I, my life was over.

152
00:08:17,271 --> 00:08:20,000
All I knew was basketball. Anybody
know anything about Carbondale?

153
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:23,690
It's about 25,000 people.
People don't leave that town.

154
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,510
It's kind of a miserable, you know, thing.

155
00:08:26,511 --> 00:08:30,320
I think like the average household median
income there is like 16,000 a year for

156
00:08:30,321 --> 00:08:33,290
families to use. Yeah. Like,
so you come from the bottom.

157
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:37,190
Did you get it repaired? Yeah. So
I had surgery, I had the red shirt.

158
00:08:37,191 --> 00:08:39,470
So when you're in college and
you set out in your red shirt,

159
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:43,880
so one day I was dating this girl and she
was going to Walmart and she literally

160
00:08:43,881 --> 00:08:46,610
was just like, Oh, you want to come to
Walmart with me? And I was like, yeah,

161
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,540
I had some pell grant money
and I was addicted to the, the,

162
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:53,000
you remember the MTV show,
road rules and real world.

163
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,830
I used to be addicted to that stuff.

164
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:58,440
So I used to watch it all the time and
I went to Walmart today and bought a

165
00:08:58,441 --> 00:08:59,550
camera. That was my,

166
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:04,190
a Sony handycam the one you used
to put little mini DV Ds in.

167
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,630
And that was the birth. I literally,

168
00:09:06,631 --> 00:09:09,050
my life changed soon as I bought
that camera and I was like, Oh,

169
00:09:09,051 --> 00:09:12,540
I'm gonna just film my
Rehab and uh, come back.

170
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,930
More ferocious than all I was doing
was like filming girls at parties,

171
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,090
doing bongs and shit like that.

172
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,580
Literally for four years
I had a camera every day.

173
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,070
So you just stopped playing
basketball? No, I can,

174
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:27,990
I continue to play basketball. I, I
came back a year after my red shirt. Um,

175
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,740
I finish at one of the top five scores
in school history and university history,

176
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:35,880
top four rebounds all time leader and
field goal percentage, all American.

177
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:39,150
And my senior year we went to the national
championship, played on national TV.

178
00:09:39,151 --> 00:09:43,830
Everything. After that was done, I wasn't
the same player after I told my ACO.

179
00:09:43,831 --> 00:09:47,940
I can just admit that like I was this
high flying super freak, athletic,

180
00:09:47,941 --> 00:09:50,940
45 inch vertical type of player to,

181
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:54,480
I couldn't do that anymore so I had to
adjust my whole game. What was wrong?

182
00:09:55,260 --> 00:10:00,210
I don't know. Maybe I just, you know,
it was different back in 2001 right.

183
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:04,620
So as far as surgery and the
Patella tendon and Patella. Yep.

184
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,820
That's, and they don't do that
anymore. They still do. They do.

185
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,540
Yeah. George Saint Pierre
had that done. Yeah.

186
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,840
They do that sometimes because
they think that the Patella Tendon,

187
00:10:14,841 --> 00:10:19,790
I had it done in 90 no. Yeah,
93 I haven't done on this leg.

188
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:22,520
And then this one I had the
cadaver, which was way easier.

189
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:26,600
Cadavers like a six month rehab and I
was back to Jujitsu a hundred percent

190
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,920
I was always like slightly
knocked lead. Right.

191
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:33,480
And it's like that surgery made my left
knee even more knock and it's like,

192
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:37,410
that's why I was telling Jamie like I
need that cause I feel like I need to like

193
00:10:37,411 --> 00:10:39,360
strengthen my teammates. Yeah.

194
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:43,520
Crazy roller thing. What is that thing
called again? Jamie? No role here.

195
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:48,260
So pull it up Ra. Yeah, I
need something like that.

196
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,930
Jamie's showing everybody. There
you go. That's crazy heavy.

197
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,450
Clamp that thing down your thigh. It
didn't seem that good for my, my cow.

198
00:10:55,451 --> 00:10:56,650
While you were like standing on it,

199
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:59,060
you gotta like you can't have any
tension on it or whatever. You're like,

200
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,380
oh but your thigh,

201
00:11:00,381 --> 00:11:03,830
it seems like it would be
a lot of pressure because
it's for sure like a spring.

202
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,840
Get a thicker your muscle.
Yeah, it's like a, it's hot.

203
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,830
I don't know how much weight is
pushing on it, but it's a lot.

204
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:13,500
And you could also push with both side
for sure. Yeah, you can call it that.

205
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,240
Our eight roll recovery, it's like it
said medical grade on the box. I was like,

206
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,640
okay, it's a medical
grade. Like weed. Yeah.

207
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,520
I feel like I need that to like wake
up my left leg still to this day to two

208
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:28,620
decades later. Did you go through
Rehab and everything? And I did.

209
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,380
I did all that work. So
listen, I recovered fine.

210
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,700
Like my college career was totally fine,
but you just didn't feel, I just did.

211
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:40,410
Honestly, I lost the love of basketball,
honestly, after filling girls,

212
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:45,210
that's all I had in my life was
basketball. So once that was gone,

213
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:48,360
even when I came back it
was, I wasn't the same.

214
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,290
So even though I had games
where I was 25 points,

215
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:57,250
15 like x, great games, winning
all these awards, all regional,

216
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,410
I, it just wasn't there anymore.

217
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:04,650
And I hacked this camera that I love to
just have because that year off I was

218
00:12:06,311 --> 00:12:06,611
able to,

219
00:12:06,611 --> 00:12:11,611
I like my first ever film I ever did
was I went around campus and film like

220
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:15,850
girls asked them who the hottest
athletes was and I felt like they gave me

221
00:12:15,851 --> 00:12:18,170
power, gave me power,

222
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:21,520
like just to be able to cause back then
that's when girls gone wild was popular.

223
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,140
Oh Wow. Yeah.

224
00:12:23,141 --> 00:12:27,960
That was 2000 gone walk
man, Girls Gone Wild Duck.

225
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:32,950
Stan hope hosted that at one point
in time. Yeah, that's funny. But,

226
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:36,940
so I graduated college in 2004 and um,

227
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,780
I moved to Phoenix where my
best friend, Mr Organic and uh,

228
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:44,470
he was out there just living and I
wanted to get out of my little town.

229
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,690
So I went out there and I,

230
00:12:46,691 --> 00:12:50,080
I kinda wanted to like take a year
off and then try to play professional

231
00:12:50,081 --> 00:12:54,310
basketball because you either play
in the NBA or you go overseas to play

232
00:12:54,311 --> 00:12:55,144
basketball.

233
00:12:55,330 --> 00:13:00,330
So I went to Phoenix with no idea what
I was going to do with my life and I,

234
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,860
I literally started working
at a call center, Amir. Uh,

235
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:09,820
it was uh, what was that? O f a phone
company that went out of business.

236
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:14,920
I can't remember what it was called, but
uh, I used to just call people collect,

237
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:18,790
uh, and try to get them to sign up for
long distance and then you get caught.

238
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,520
Like I, I got caught every
word in the book every day.

239
00:13:21,521 --> 00:13:24,370
But it was funny like people's calling
you the n word and everything and you're

240
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:25,990
just laughing cause they bad. Right.

241
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,290
And then you like convinced them like
90 year old lady to sign up for long

242
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,740
distance knowing that as illegal
as hell. Like you just convincing,

243
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,600
convincing this lady to
sign up for a long distance.

244
00:13:34,601 --> 00:13:36,490
But I was good at it
though. I was good at it.

245
00:13:36,491 --> 00:13:38,590
So that was like my first
job I ever had in my life.

246
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,170
So it's like one of them shady phone,

247
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,700
they call you up like I get those
Robo calls calls you, you did that.

248
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:49,900
Like do you want unlimited long distance?
Do you feel guilty? A little bit.

249
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:54,190
But they went out. They went out of
business. I like six months after I uh,

250
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:59,220
had the job and I from there I just didn't
know what I was going to do and I had

251
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,130
a, um,

252
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:05,350
he's not my cousin but he's like
somebody we all call our cousins,

253
00:14:05,351 --> 00:14:08,860
like black people. We call everybody
I cousins but he played in the NBA.

254
00:14:08,861 --> 00:14:11,440
His name was Troy Hudson
and he was from my town.

255
00:14:11,441 --> 00:14:14,230
So he was like the most successful
person that ever got out of our town.

256
00:14:14,231 --> 00:14:18,190
He was playing for the
Minnesota Timberwolves and
I reached out to him cause I

257
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,420
basically was like, listen man,

258
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:24,250
I need help cause I want to
play basketball again but
I don't know how I'm going

259
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,900
to, I don't have an agent,
I don't have anything.

260
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:30,280
So he kind of invited us
up to Minneapolis. That's
the first time I lived.

261
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,810
I literally went from Evansville,

262
00:14:31,811 --> 00:14:35,350
Phoenix to Minneapolis to try to
pursue this whole basketball career.

263
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:39,680
And I did that for like three years.
Like chasing it, going to try outs,

264
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,331
things like that,

265
00:14:40,331 --> 00:14:44,890
sending tapes to agents and things
like that and it just didn't pan out.

266
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:47,560
Nothing stuck. You know, I
had opportunities, they just,

267
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:51,410
I just wasn't the same player and I
can admit that and I'm comfortable that

268
00:14:51,411 --> 00:14:53,540
because I know I had a
successful basketball career,

269
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:58,400
just didn't go to the level where I made
millions of dollars. So after that man,

270
00:14:58,401 --> 00:15:02,540
I was literally stuck after traveling
around the world. I ended up in Malaysia,

271
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,510
I was in Australia trying to Asia,

272
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,000
you don't want to know how I ended
up over here, man. This is funny.

273
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,600
Only a few people know this story. So

274
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,460
when you were at your bottom you
try to find something for comfort.

275
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,950
I've never done weed or
anything in my life, but I,

276
00:15:19,951 --> 00:15:23,200
I was addicted to like
online dating back then. Yes.

277
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:27,290
I was like trying to meet girls, like
just to try to find some situation.

278
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:31,010
I felt like, Oh, I feel incomplete. So
let me like online date or whatever.

279
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,210
And I met this girl,

280
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,450
like one of my friends in Phoenix
played basketball in Kuala Lumpur.

281
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,570
So obviously you need a
visa to go over there.

282
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:42,590
So I'm thinking to myself like what's
stuck the way I could get over there to

283
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:46,580
Kuala Lumpur and try to play basketball.
So I was like, oh online dating.

284
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:49,370
I don't even remember what website
or see you're a good looking guy.

285
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,800
I know how you not
getting girls in America.

286
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:55,490
I do but I'm just saying I was
just listen, my whole point,

287
00:15:55,970 --> 00:16:00,170
my point was I literally met this
girl in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

288
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,100
She was from Canada,

289
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,710
she was a singer over there singing
in little military bars over there.

290
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,770
There's little hot blind or
whatever she was. And um,

291
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:11,600
I remember talking to her for about a
month and I convinced her that I wanted to

292
00:16:11,601 --> 00:16:14,630
come visit her, but my whole
intention was let me get over there,

293
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:18,500
try to find out what this team is and
see if I could like try out for him some

294
00:16:18,501 --> 00:16:21,860
crazy shit. You don't do that
today. I did it back then.

295
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,620
So I went over there to,

296
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:27,500
I'm laughing cause I know
people that know me is dying.

297
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,130
Listening to this right now.
This is a true 100% store.

298
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,450
I get over there to
Malaysia with no money.

299
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:39,260
I may have $400 I got people
to pay for ticket here.

300
00:16:39,261 --> 00:16:42,560
I'm going to Malaysia to play
basketball. Just lying to people, right?

301
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:46,220
So I get over there. This girl, I only
want to say her name, she might sue me,

302
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,840
but she picked me up at the airport.
She looked exactly like her pictures.

303
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:56,150
Beautiful from Canada, everything.
So she take me to her apartment.

304
00:16:56,151 --> 00:16:58,470
She got this nice apartment.
It's like in a jungle chair.

305
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,990
Like I'm talking about the balcony. I
seen like little monkeys on the balcony.

306
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,080
Oh yes. It was crazy. And then
it's like a rain forest. Right?

307
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,080
And then in Malaysia, if
you ever been to Malaysia,

308
00:17:09,081 --> 00:17:12,710
I don't know if it's like that now
the doors are high off the ground,

309
00:17:12,711 --> 00:17:16,850
like two inches. So it's like anything
can crawl under the doors or whatever.

310
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,700
So that's the first thing I noticed
when I got to Malaysia. I was like,

311
00:17:19,701 --> 00:17:22,940
this is some crazy shit, right? We
in the jungle and the dude like,

312
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:25,310
what about snakes or bugs?

313
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:29,150
I remember asking these little kids when
I first got to Malaysia, I was like,

314
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:33,590
have you ever seen a snake like in
this area? And he was like, yeah,

315
00:17:33,591 --> 00:17:36,830
I seen the Cobra and all that stuff.
And I was just like, Holy Shit.

316
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:40,460
But the back to her, she
turned out to be a sex addict.

317
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,090
Yes. Congratulations man.
Listen, Yo, this is crazy. Like,

318
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,490
because this is way before
I ever decided this,

319
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,850
I'm going to do film for a
living. Right. I was over there,

320
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,320
um, the first day I got there, like
I had a good time with her. Then I,

321
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:58,800
you know,

322
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:03,090
ended up having relations with the lady
and she turned out to be a sex addict.

323
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,680
So, you know, as a man,

324
00:18:04,681 --> 00:18:07,770
I just flew all the way across
the world to see this girl.

325
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,610
The sleeve would air and then all of
a sudden she wanted to do it again and

326
00:18:11,611 --> 00:18:14,220
again and again. And then when you
like slow down, like, you know,

327
00:18:14,221 --> 00:18:18,480
I just got her shit bro.
She started crying and going
nuts. And I'm in Malaysia,

328
00:18:18,481 --> 00:18:21,240
I'm like, I don't know who
this girl is. Oh No, listen,

329
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:22,980
she's crying cause you
won't fuck her again. Yes.

330
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:27,300
How many times you fucker about
two times that you wanted to yeah,

331
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:31,620
you too long. The time still
like shit. It was crazy.

332
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,460
So then I even listen, I am in
Malaysia. This, I'm not in America,

333
00:18:35,461 --> 00:18:36,300
I'm in Malaysia.

334
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:41,660
So the crazy thing is probably after a
week she started to go crazy and complain

335
00:18:43,261 --> 00:18:47,700
about I'm not sleeping with her.
I'm a, I'm in my, I'm in my prime,

336
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:50,070
my sexual peak and you
don't want to sleep with me.

337
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:53,640
And I'm just thinking of myself like I
don't know what the fuck am I doing over

338
00:18:53,641 --> 00:18:58,080
here in Malaysia? Like what? This lady.
So I ended up meeting this black guy,

339
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,010
uh, that she introduced me to. There
was like a hustler in Kuala Lumpur,

340
00:19:02,011 --> 00:19:02,844
Malaysia.

341
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:07,740
And I started hanging out with him just
to get out of the house and he was like

342
00:19:07,741 --> 00:19:10,120
living with, you don't have any
money to go home. Oh my God.

343
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,950
I'm just stuck in Kuala Lumpur and La
with this beautiful girl that you have to

344
00:19:13,951 --> 00:19:17,650
fuck all the time. First of
all problems, right? Serious.

345
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,240
And then she started getting even
bitter. Like, I hate Americans.

346
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,260
You Americans are so ungrateful.
And I'm just thinking like, damn,

347
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:29,430
wow, you're representing America.
It was crazy. I was like, damn,

348
00:19:29,431 --> 00:19:33,210
I must've just didn't
do a good enough. Sorry.

349
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,910
I thought our girls be lined in right.

350
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,980
Maybe she was just extraordinary.

351
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:43,140
And she was like in her late thirties
and I was in my early twenties so some

352
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:47,600
girls in their late thirties, they
hit this itchy peak man all the time.

353
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,230
She ended up skiing or kicked
me out her house in Malaysia.

354
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:55,290
I went out with Bobby one night.
This dude, his name was Bobby too,

355
00:19:55,650 --> 00:20:00,450
and m w I came home and she
shit, um, your stuff is outside.

356
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,840
Like she texted me, I had a little
international phone. She was like,

357
00:20:03,841 --> 00:20:06,060
your stuff is outside. I'm
thinking like, she was like, yeah,

358
00:20:06,061 --> 00:20:08,190
this is not working out.
So think about that.

359
00:20:08,191 --> 00:20:11,640
Imagine being in another country and
this is not working out. No money,

360
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:14,760
no money, zero oh not a dime.

361
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,240
And I see the guy that I was with, I
told him what happened. He was like,

362
00:20:18,241 --> 00:20:19,530
I'm gonna take you over
there and get your stuff.

363
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,120
He could stay with me
until you figure it out.

364
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:25,590
I get there and all my stuff
is outside, everything.

365
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,020
She's not there, she's
done left or whatever.

366
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:31,340
And I had some brand new timberlands.
Remember the boots templates?

367
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,140
I am poor shit. I need them
timberlands. They in a house.

368
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:38,400
I had more on brand new. So I kicked
the door down. Boom. Oh No. Yes.

369
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,840
Like I was trying to get into the door.

370
00:20:39,841 --> 00:20:42,420
I just kicked it and it broke
like the little handle broke.

371
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:45,210
I got in and got my timberlands left.
I remember she texted me, she was like,

372
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:47,350
Hey, did you break my
door? I was like, Nah,

373
00:20:47,351 --> 00:20:51,070
I don't know what you're talking about.
I just left. So from there I was,

374
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,730
I stayed with Bobby for like
three weeks in Malaysia.

375
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:58,870
I was hanging out with him everyday
going to parties and I'm like, Bro,

376
00:20:58,871 --> 00:21:02,510
I gotta get home to America. So
I contacted my, one of my, uh,

377
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,290
mentors growing up, uh, in Australia,

378
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:08,710
he was playing pro professional basketball
in Melbourne name Rashad Tucker.

379
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:12,610
Shout out to him and I convinced them
to get me a ticket to come over to

380
00:21:12,611 --> 00:21:16,000
Melbourne because I was like,
Bro, I need some money to go home.

381
00:21:16,001 --> 00:21:18,430
And he was like, Nah man, I just get
you a ticket to come to Melbourne.

382
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,830
I was like, Bro, literally like
I'm trying to go back to America.

383
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:27,130
I don't know what to. But then when
he, he sold me on, I was like, damn,

384
00:21:27,131 --> 00:21:30,310
I really ain't going back to nothing,
so let me go. He was like, man,

385
00:21:30,311 --> 00:21:33,760
you can come over here and try out for
the team. You can try practice with us.

386
00:21:33,761 --> 00:21:34,271
And I was like, oh,

387
00:21:34,271 --> 00:21:36,880
that may be my opportunity to
play professional basketball if I,

388
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,400
he's one of the top players in Australia.

389
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:44,440
So I ended up in Melbourne and I
was in Melbourne for three months,

390
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,710
not doing shit, but going
out practicing with the team.

391
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:51,370
They was mid season so I couldn't like
make a team because they was already,

392
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:51,791
you know,

393
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:56,440
they think and then I ended up getting
stranded over there too because he left

394
00:21:56,441 --> 00:22:01,300
me cause he cheated on his girlfriend
and uh, he had to go make up with her.

395
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,370
So he left me talking
about I'm going to be back.

396
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:07,060
And then I was just stuck
in Australia. Like, Yo Bro,

397
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:11,620
I need to get back to America job. No
job, no money, nothing. He was like,

398
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:16,030
uh, I'm glad I was young when I did
all this stuff. He was like, hey man,

399
00:22:16,031 --> 00:22:19,030
tell her, tell one of them girls
a sob story. They'll get you a,

400
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:25,990
I'm like a sob story, Bro. You have
money. Buy me a ticket to go home, man.

401
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:30,670
I can't do it right now. I'm like, man.
So I had to tell this girl a sob story.

402
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,700
Her name was Deanna, Deanna Casar.

403
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:36,310
I'm giving her a shot out
because she saved my life.

404
00:22:36,311 --> 00:22:38,670
She bought me a ticket home. She,

405
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:43,780
she went in her savings and bought
me a ticket back from Melbourne to Ho

406
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:46,380
Honolulu to Los Vegas. And, um,

407
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:51,460
I didn't know why I chose Las Vegas,
but I just chose to go to Las Vegas.

408
00:22:51,461 --> 00:22:55,300
So you literally had zero money,
zero micro job. How were you eating?

409
00:22:56,350 --> 00:23:01,060
Shit. Her people that I was around
right. They just fed you. Yeah man.

410
00:23:01,061 --> 00:23:04,730
Sometimes you have angels in your life
and I guess these people were angels to,

411
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:08,740
cause I was just telling Jamie like I
just seen a documentary on homelessness.

412
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:12,580
It was like four out of five people
in La County paycheck to paycheck.

413
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:17,700
I think it was like eight or it's four
out of five people are like one $400

414
00:23:17,701 --> 00:23:22,150
emergency from being broke or it was
like 80% of people live paycheck to

415
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:24,660
paycheck. So I always
tell people like when,

416
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,520
when I'm inspiring people now I'm
like Bro, I was homeless once.

417
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:30,850
Cause that's essentially homelessness.
Yeah. If you ain't gotta address,

418
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,480
you can't pay bills. You're homeless no
matter if you got a roof over your head.

419
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,340
And I think, I feel like people,

420
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:42,300
you see all these beautiful moments
that I do now or what anybody does does,

421
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:45,950
and they don't see the, the story
that ultimately led, like what,

422
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,580
what ultimately turn to you
doing what you're doing now.

423
00:23:49,581 --> 00:23:53,450
So after Australia I went to Vegas.
I was living with two strippers.

424
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:57,430
Yes. I live with two strippers.
Graduations again. Yeah,

425
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:01,850
I'll live in Vegas with two strippers
that worked at the Rhino Despair Rhino.

426
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:06,830
I met him on Craig lists for
rooms to rent Jesus Christ.

427
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,510
And I had enough money,

428
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:12,170
like $600 to move into a room.

429
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,230
So I literally moved in with these girls.

430
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:20,180
And one day, have you ever
been in a Vegas casinos?

431
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,040
Cause this is like the climax you
ever seen like the mega bucks slots.

432
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:28,610
So one day it was flowy Mayweather
versus Oscar de la Hoya.

433
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:32,090
So that was the year I was in the,

434
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,070
the Mirage and I seen these two hot black
girls and I had like some money in my

435
00:24:37,071 --> 00:24:40,370
pocket car haunted or something. So
I wanted to sit down next to him.

436
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:43,430
So I went over there and sat next
to him and was just, you know,

437
00:24:43,431 --> 00:24:47,450
trying to shoot the shit and I put a $20
in the slots cause you know you can get

438
00:24:47,451 --> 00:24:50,990
free drinks if you put in a slot. So
I just hitting it, talking to him,

439
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:52,850
where y'all from? Y'all going
into fight, blah blah blah.

440
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:56,750
And then one of the girls was like,
hey you won. I was like, Oh okay.

441
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:59,270
You know you thinking he ain't went
in those slots. Guess how much I want?

442
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,420
How much? Nah Thousand
Dollars Whoa. Swear to God.

443
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:08,090
$9,000 till somebody
broke. Wow. Yes. $9,000.

444
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:10,150
So when they give you that,

445
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:13,370
do you pay taxes on it later or they all
gave him a wrong social security number

446
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:18,470
though. You're getting the wrong. So yeah,
I gave him the wrong stuff. They can,

447
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:20,660
you can do that. Yeah. Cause
they just actually your name,

448
00:25:20,661 --> 00:25:22,120
your social security number. Okay.

449
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:25,610
Maybe you shouldn't have just
told everybody that they aren't,

450
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,120
they can't prove that I
want anything. They can.

451
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:32,490
That was like 12 years ago. They
didn't have records back then. Now.

452
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:36,230
I don't think so. I hope not. Nah, me
too. Ain't nobody gonna Watch this.

453
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:40,100
Nobody's watching them. And I know this,
this is nobody's gonna want nothing.

454
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,240
So after that, I literally
lived off that, um,

455
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:47,870
nine grand for about the
rest of the summer. And uh,

456
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:51,650
I ended up moving to San Diego after
that. Like I'm skipping some stuff,

457
00:25:51,651 --> 00:25:56,090
but I moved to San Diego and that's when
my life changed because I lived in San

458
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:58,130
Diego and was just partying.
What brought you to San Diego?

459
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,350
I met a guy in Vegas during the,

460
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:04,700
the night of the Floyd Mayweather fight
and just party with him that night and I

461
00:26:04,701 --> 00:26:08,090
just got his phone number one time and
then I was just staying in touch with

462
00:26:08,091 --> 00:26:10,790
them or whatever. And then he was like,
I live in San Diego. He was in the Navy,

463
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:14,870
Dr Bill. And um, I literally said,

464
00:26:14,871 --> 00:26:16,670
let me come out there
one weekend. I was like,

465
00:26:16,671 --> 00:26:18,290
let me just come out there and
kick it with you or whatever.

466
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:21,140
Cause he was telling me how
great San Diego was and I'm,

467
00:26:21,141 --> 00:26:23,570
I went out there and I
didn't leave for four years.

468
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:26,630
San Diego was pretty awesome.
Yeah. I love San Diego but I,

469
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:30,500
I essentially was doing the same thing
I was doing for the past couple of years

470
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:34,970
lost cause you gotta understand
like athletes go through this now.

471
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:35,631
Like I just did,

472
00:26:35,631 --> 00:26:39,860
I just released the episode where Ryan
Bader on my channel and I talked to him

473
00:26:39,861 --> 00:26:42,410
about that. Like when, when
your sports career is done,

474
00:26:42,411 --> 00:26:45,750
a lot of people go to something
else they lost and things like that.

475
00:26:45,751 --> 00:26:50,751
And I was for about four or five years
and it wasn't until I lived in San Diego

476
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:53,940
that I figured, I was like, man, I
gotta really do something with my life.

477
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:58,140
I'm literally a failure. I
got, I have a college degree.

478
00:26:58,141 --> 00:26:59,340
I graduated from college.

479
00:26:59,341 --> 00:27:02,910
So it wasn't like I just didn't want that
responsibility of having to do a nine

480
00:27:02,911 --> 00:27:04,200
to five or and things like that.

481
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:09,210
So it wasn't until I live in San Diego
that I literally talked to the guy that I

482
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:10,880
was living with him and was like, Bro, I,

483
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,990
I don't know what I'm
gonna do with my life bro,

484
00:27:12,991 --> 00:27:17,010
but I gotta figure something out.
I was like nearing 30 and um,

485
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:21,960
I ended up moving to Minneapolis back
to Minneapolis and I got a job as a

486
00:27:21,961 --> 00:27:25,590
teacher, like a teacher's assistant
and they called it behavior system.

487
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:30,060
I was like working with kindergarten kids
to Jesus. Literally crazy life. Right?

488
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:34,000
What a crazy life ended up where I'm at
now to be on Joe Rogan. Right. So it,

489
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,710
it was March 3rd to 2011. Um,

490
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:41,580
it was like negative 20 degrees
outside. I was living with my guy,

491
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,620
my best friend, and I'm,

492
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:47,580
I went to work that day and it was
freezing outside and they literally still

493
00:27:47,581 --> 00:27:51,000
went to recess that day. I'll never
forget that. They was like, Oh,

494
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:55,320
put your coats and gloves on kids.
It's time to go to, to recess.

495
00:27:55,321 --> 00:27:57,540
And I was like, what do you mean
we going into the gym or outside?

496
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:59,970
It's like we're going outside. I was
like, man, these people in Minnesota,

497
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,220
crazy hard. Those are hard people, Bro.

498
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:05,340
That was the last day I ever worked
in my life. He said, fuck this.

499
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:06,750
I can't do it, man. I was like, Bro,

500
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,950
that whether it was just the fact that I
was like, what am I doing with my life?

501
00:28:10,951 --> 00:28:14,460
I'm working with Kenneth, the great,
rewarding job. I'm like, what?

502
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:18,510
It's nothing wrong with me. I'm
physically able to do anything.

503
00:28:18,511 --> 00:28:22,380
I'm intelligent enough to do anything.
I'm qualified enough to do anything.

504
00:28:22,381 --> 00:28:25,140
You're a victim of circumstance.
Victim just kept happening.

505
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:28,500
Things kept happening. Um, and
a lot of it is my fault. Like,

506
00:28:28,501 --> 00:28:32,880
because you're just lazy, right?
So March 30 2011 is the day I,

507
00:28:32,881 --> 00:28:37,260
I said I'm quitting my job. I went
back to my apartment when my roommate,

508
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:42,180
he was pissed. He was like,
Bro, you always quitting
jobs. And he was like, Bro,

509
00:28:42,181 --> 00:28:44,550
what you going to do? I was like, Bro,
I'm, I'm Finna figure something out.

510
00:28:44,551 --> 00:28:48,180
I'm going to buy a camera to do something.
He was like, yeah, yeah, whatever.

511
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,090
And,

512
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:52,650
and we literally was sitting
in the kitchen in this
little kitchen on the floor

513
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:56,160
talking about life. Cause I would
just tell, I literally mentally broke.

514
00:28:56,161 --> 00:28:59,220
I was like, Bro, I'm just Jack.
Like I got to figure something out.

515
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,050
I had pell grant was coming up,

516
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:05,940
I was getting my tax returns back and I
had enough to buy a camera and the first

517
00:29:05,941 --> 00:29:07,980
camera I ever bought was a canon t to die.

518
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:13,170
It was like $800 and I bought a
lens and that was it. That was it.

519
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,160
It changed my life.

520
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:18,630
And I literally spent like the next
year shooting videos in garages,

521
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:21,150
like cars coming up, filming the wheels.

522
00:29:21,151 --> 00:29:25,050
And I was just really literally hone in
myself because back then when I had a

523
00:29:25,051 --> 00:29:25,980
camera in college,

524
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,620
digital cameras wasn't even out until
2008 like these little new style cameras.

525
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,320
So I had to relearn everything. And I,

526
00:29:33,321 --> 00:29:37,260
I really learned a lot from youtube
and Vimeo and I was watching the,

527
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,470
I had a creative eye and a
mindset. So I was just like,

528
00:29:40,471 --> 00:29:41,530
I got to get the skillset.

529
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:46,800
So I started doing rap videos
for $50 a hundred dollars free.

530
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,080
You know, I tell all these kids,
they messaged me now like, Bro,

531
00:29:50,081 --> 00:29:52,000
I spent two years on videos for free,

532
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,150
just trying to learn how to do this stuff.

533
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,240
Everybody want to get paid
for something. And I'm like,

534
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,820
you probably don't deserve
to get paid yet. So I,

535
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:04,750
I had friends shout out
to Matt, Irv, Mr Organic,

536
00:30:04,751 --> 00:30:08,830
like I was shooting a videos for
free and I was just getting better.

537
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:11,290
I was getting better and
better and better and better.

538
00:30:11,291 --> 00:30:12,580
And then like three years into it,

539
00:30:12,581 --> 00:30:16,930
I shot a music video called Saks fifth
avenue and I'm see you're editing these

540
00:30:16,931 --> 00:30:19,540
as well. I'm editing, I'm doing
them all you editing on, uh,

541
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:24,200
at the time I was editing
on Sony Vegas, uh, uh,

542
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:28,090
old program. Now it's, it's,
it's, it's popular now.

543
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,120
It's pretty easy to use and um,

544
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:35,950
it was cheap to buy like 90 bucks.
So I was able to use that. Um,

545
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:39,430
like the movie studio version that was,
you don't get all the little tools,

546
00:30:39,431 --> 00:30:43,120
but you got enough. And I
had this cheap laptop, uh,

547
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:47,110
that this girl bought me a, she lied and
told me she was gonna buy me a camera.

548
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:51,900
They ended up buying me a laptop.
I was pissed off and I was like,

549
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:53,320
she was like, listen,

550
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:57,910
like the most popular a
camera back in like 2011.

551
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:02,080
It was like a canon five d
mark two. It was like $2,000.

552
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,650
I couldn't afford that.
So I met this girl online

553
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:12,490
literally from Denver, Colorado,
from Denver, Colorado. And you know,

554
00:31:12,491 --> 00:31:16,010
you start your little love affair or
whatever you talking and you promising and

555
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:19,570
I want to see you. So one day she was
like, I'm gonna come see you in Minnesota.

556
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,740
This is around the time I started. And uh,

557
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,480
she told me she was going to buy me that
camera cause I was telling you that's

558
00:31:25,481 --> 00:31:29,500
like my dream camera, my Jean Camera.
And I remember my roommate, uh,

559
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,840
like I'll run in his room like, look bro,

560
00:31:31,841 --> 00:31:35,080
look at his short film that was shot with
this camera. I'm Finna had his camera,

561
00:31:35,081 --> 00:31:36,580
Bro. We Finna do all types of things.

562
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:39,130
So she like kept telling
me she had the camera,

563
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:42,610
kept telling me he had the camera. So
like the day she came, I picked her up.

564
00:31:42,611 --> 00:31:47,360
I had this little use nine 1992
for tours. It was blue and uh,

565
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,950
I picked her up at the airport. I
remember I was like, where the camera at?

566
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:56,110
As soon as soon as she picked me up where
the camera, she was like, don't worry,

567
00:31:56,111 --> 00:31:58,660
don't worry, don't worry. And I'm
like driving thinking like, man,

568
00:31:58,661 --> 00:32:01,720
she ain't got this camera. She lied to
me. She just wanted to see me. Right.

569
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:06,640
So we get to my apartment and my boy,
he anticipating it too. He like, man,

570
00:32:06,641 --> 00:32:09,310
he finna get this. Can we finish?
Shoot all their music videos, right.

571
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:13,390
Cause if you get this camera at this
time, you, oh you shooting at a five d.

572
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,900
So I remember she like pulled,
she was like, here's a gift.

573
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:19,360
It's like she pulled out the gift and
I was like, this ain't no camera box.

574
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:22,740
It was a brand new laptop. And
I'm sitting here complaining,

575
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,680
I'm complaining about a laptop
and I already have a camera.

576
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:29,650
But she like gave me this laptop and
I was just like, all right, cool.

577
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:31,710
So she gave me the laptop and I,

578
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:36,250
I get the Sony Vegas program and then I
started editing with that and I had that

579
00:32:36,251 --> 00:32:39,980
camera for about two years. I
was in the girl, I don't know,

580
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:45,560
there's a lot of that in my life and
I don't blame them. Girls. Listen man.

581
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:49,850
Yeah. I used to be one of those
guys, you know, Dum, Dum girls,

582
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,110
this materialistic and he all about nice
things and he liked to travel or you

583
00:32:54,111 --> 00:32:57,770
ever dated a girl and you like see her
previous boyfriend and they be like,

584
00:32:57,771 --> 00:32:58,041
damn,

585
00:32:58,041 --> 00:33:03,041
they don't want to like Napa Valley and
fucking Vegas for her birthday or a New

586
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:07,010
York. And you're like, damn, I can't
even take you to the movies. I'm like,

587
00:33:07,011 --> 00:33:10,370
Damn. So for me, if a
girl get tired of you,

588
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:14,920
now they call it ghosting, right? They
call it ghosting. But back then ghosted,

589
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:17,360
that's what ghosting was. It's like,
oh, this guy ain't worth nothing.

590
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,430
Let me get rid of him.
So she left, she left.

591
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,320
I had a summer job.

592
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:29,270
My last ever official job was at 43 hoops
in Minnesota was a basketball academy

593
00:33:29,271 --> 00:33:34,271
where I was there with a lot
of pro basketball players
or semi-pro or guys that

594
00:33:34,341 --> 00:33:38,220
had college experience and we just
taught kids all the time. And um,

595
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,340
I was getting paid, you know,

596
00:33:40,341 --> 00:33:44,330
$20 an hour or $25 an hour
per session to teach kids.

597
00:33:44,331 --> 00:33:48,950
And I kind of made a Ruckus. They're
two complaining about just Bro,

598
00:33:48,951 --> 00:33:51,290
we teach in 20 kids and
I'm only getting $20.

599
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:53,150
How much are y'all getting
for all these kids? Right.

600
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:56,660
But I mean that's just work, right?
I shouldn't complain about a job,

601
00:33:57,170 --> 00:34:00,110
but that whole summer I was
just telling everybody in here,

602
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:02,510
I'm going to do film. I'm
moving back to California.

603
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:05,270
I'm about to just do film about
to do film because I had enough,

604
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,920
like I was doing videos at that point,

605
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:10,700
but now I have a part time job that I'm
able to do videos and I never forget.

606
00:34:10,701 --> 00:34:12,800
One day I was telling a
group of guys in there,

607
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:16,310
I'm quitting this job
and I'm Finna go do film.

608
00:34:16,311 --> 00:34:19,760
And I just remember the look on their
face like you know like the boy that cried

609
00:34:19,761 --> 00:34:21,080
wolf, whatever, man,

610
00:34:21,081 --> 00:34:24,080
you ain't going to do anything but
that drove me and St Joe doubt,

611
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:27,590
doubt drove things out, people
doubted me. That's what I needed.

612
00:34:27,591 --> 00:34:30,260
I needed that fueled where people
could tell me I couldn't do any.

613
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,070
You needed haters.

614
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:36,070
I needed haters and it drove me insane
and I went nuts and I started shooting a

615
00:34:37,251 --> 00:34:41,480
lot of music videos that any videographer
out there that didn't knows this

616
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:44,780
industry, they know like music videos
feed you, you make a lot of money.

617
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:47,540
It's a recession proof business. People
always going to need music videos,

618
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:50,780
especially rap videos. And
I got good, I got very good.

619
00:34:50,781 --> 00:34:53,690
I did a lot of high profile
videos. I made a lot of money.

620
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:58,640
Who did you doing for? I did a music
videos for like rappers, like chief Keef,

621
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,380
you know? Yeah. Yes. He
did his videos. Yeah.

622
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,610
It seemed like you'd have to wear a
bulletproof vest to be around that.

623
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,480
There was a video called traffic.
You got to check that out. Oh, okay.

624
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:11,720
I think I've seen that. It's that you
wild on the streets. Oh, I would imagine.

625
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,700
Wow. They're legitimately wild.

626
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:18,560
That was real gangster shit going on
with your Chicago rappers and stuff like

627
00:35:18,561 --> 00:35:20,690
that. Well that dude is like
the king of that Shit. Right?

628
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:25,370
It's only like 20 right. I
think now he's getting 20 Nah,

629
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:28,790
he probably like 2124 now.
Yeah, they was kids man.

630
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:32,510
But I was shooting a lot of music videos
in Minneapolis and I got popular cause

631
00:35:32,511 --> 00:35:36,860
that's a huge music scene. It's a very
indie, you know, prince made it popular,

632
00:35:36,861 --> 00:35:41,610
but I think the hip hop scene is
very in rich at. They just don't,

633
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,370
they haven't had anybody
like explode out of there.

634
00:35:44,371 --> 00:35:48,330
So I made a living just in Minneapolis,
like shooting music videos.

635
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:52,530
But after a while, I remember I was dating
this girl and this one lasted a bit.

636
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,920
And I remember I used to brag to
her like, look at his music video,

637
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:56,970
this music video. And she was like,

638
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,970
you want to just be known
for doing music videos?

639
00:35:59,971 --> 00:36:02,940
You want to be a guy that just do music
videos, you need to do other stuff.

640
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:04,740
And that's what woke me up. I was like,

641
00:36:04,741 --> 00:36:07,710
let me see if I can tap into my
creative side and do other things.

642
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:11,280
So I did like a film called like
the confessions of skid row.

643
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:15,580
I would literally went to skid row and
filmed homeless people I don't want Yup.

644
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,320
And I'm not available yet. It's
somewhere on the line. Online.

645
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,690
Real freaks me out. Yeah. It was
called the confessions skid row.

646
00:36:21,691 --> 00:36:23,820
And then I did, it was cool. I
was like, I'm gonna make this,

647
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:25,410
this series called the confessions.

648
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:29,670
And then I did the confessions of Gay
Pride and I literally interviewed this guy

649
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:34,650
in San Diego about how, when
Obama passed a don't ask,

650
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:37,980
don't tell. Like I, I
interviewed this guy, um,

651
00:36:37,981 --> 00:36:41,370
and he told me how he came out
to his parents and I'm like,

652
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:43,890
I know my boys just look at me
like what the Carol do you doing?

653
00:36:43,891 --> 00:36:48,220
Like these types of films. But I was
fascinated by documentaries so I was like,

654
00:36:48,221 --> 00:36:51,890
let me just do this type of documentary
content doing the one on skid road.

655
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,110
Did that have like an extra impact on you
because you were basically home? Yeah,

656
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:58,110
100% I told, I told the guy I was like,

657
00:36:58,111 --> 00:37:01,590
I was literally homeless so I know what
she feels like and I don't think people

658
00:37:01,591 --> 00:37:03,780
understand that. Like if
I look at my life now,

659
00:37:03,781 --> 00:37:06,990
I live in downtown l a view of the
staple center, things like that.

660
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,870
Like they don't understand.
Years ago I didn't have,

661
00:37:09,871 --> 00:37:13,710
I couldn't afford to live in a $400 a
month apartment. You see what I'm saying?

662
00:37:13,711 --> 00:37:16,560
Cause you didn't have any guaranteed
income and that's how it was.

663
00:37:16,561 --> 00:37:20,160
Even the beginning of my film career I
lived out at like you know them shitty

664
00:37:20,161 --> 00:37:23,820
hotels I why are they not shitty to
everybody but like extended stays. Yeah.

665
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:28,740
I lived in extended stays for
like two years. Literally.

666
00:37:28,741 --> 00:37:33,540
Like I say I was getting a $400 for a
music video from a rapper or something

667
00:37:33,541 --> 00:37:37,040
like that. I will use 200 of that
for six days in extended state.

668
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,070
Cause you know there was like $30 a
night. It'd be nights where I'm like damn,

669
00:37:41,071 --> 00:37:42,030
I got one day left.

670
00:37:42,031 --> 00:37:45,150
I got to convince somebody to give
me like $200 to shoot a music video.

671
00:37:45,151 --> 00:37:48,240
So I was hustling, like reaching
out to people on Facebook. Hey Man,

672
00:37:48,241 --> 00:37:49,260
you try shooting music video,

673
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:53,880
you're trying to day not knowing I
need this money to just live somewhere.

674
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:54,773
Wow.

675
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:59,810
So once I was able to sustain enough
income because it's just too long of a

676
00:37:59,941 --> 00:38:00,211
story,

677
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:03,450
but I was able to really get myself to
a point where I was making some money.

678
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:07,500
I moved to Florida where my
best friend tone from Macedonia,

679
00:38:07,501 --> 00:38:11,340
six foot nine Macedonian mercenary.
That's where he wanted to be.

680
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,620
Like he a crazy guy.

681
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:17,070
Like he wants to like go around the
world and kill like drug dealers.

682
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:21,630
That's literally he from Macedonian
man. They crazy man. They crazy.

683
00:38:21,631 --> 00:38:23,220
So brother tone.

684
00:38:23,221 --> 00:38:26,550
I moved in with him in Boca Raton
and that's literally has started.

685
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:29,580
That's how all of this and that email
fighter stuff started. I moved to Florida,

686
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:32,310
live with him. I had a roommate,
so it was cheaper to live.

687
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:34,830
I went to Italy that year
and shot a documentary.

688
00:38:34,831 --> 00:38:36,070
So I got some money from my Guy

689
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:40,510
Bobby Jones. And um, I was able to
have a life. I felt comfortable.

690
00:38:40,511 --> 00:38:44,680
I wasn't like, felt like a, a a
monkey was on my back at that point.

691
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,890
Um, you getting momentum?
I got momentum. Um,

692
00:38:47,891 --> 00:38:51,190
I had a lot of momentum at that
point. About 2014 I was making money.

693
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,350
So when you were doing
these documentaries,

694
00:38:53,351 --> 00:38:56,500
like confessions of skid row
and confessions at Gay Pride,

695
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:59,050
like what are you doing with them and
how are you getting paid from them?

696
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:02,410
Just releasing them online for free will
and then I didn't get paid for anything

697
00:39:02,411 --> 00:39:07,360
I paid. I paid like I paid like the
homeless guy to let me talk to them.

698
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:10,010
They gotta be on Vimeo. They gotta be in.

699
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:12,160
You put them on Youtube and
get the ad revenue from. Yeah.

700
00:39:12,161 --> 00:39:14,860
That was back in the day though. But
there, are they out there right now?

701
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,450
Like no, I have, I have a great
one. If you know Alan Watts. Yes.

702
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:22,680
So it's called the beauty of
nothing is by Allen Watson.

703
00:39:22,681 --> 00:39:25,960
If you put the beauty and nothingness
by Allen Watson Will Harris,

704
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,300
you'll see one of the most beautiful
homeless films you ever seen.

705
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:31,240
That was like three years ago. I
went to New York. I was here in La,

706
00:39:31,241 --> 00:39:33,520
I was in Florida. I was just sitting
on the streets for homeless people,

707
00:39:33,521 --> 00:39:37,240
talking to them for a, for two days.
And is it Alan Watts narration?

708
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:42,010
He is the beauty or nothingness. It
like won the award in New York. Well,

709
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:45,100
when I first saw, I don't remember what
video I saw of yours. That was first,

710
00:39:45,101 --> 00:39:49,150
but I was like, this guy has got an eye
for shit. You, you, it's not the stamp.

711
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:52,780
You know, sometimes you can see videos
and you're just watching a video.

712
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,080
Like okay, this is cool. I'm
seeing how these guys are training.

713
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:59,350
I'm seeing their lifestyle, what
I'm seeing. You know their family,

714
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:03,490
but then you see one and you go,
oh whoever the fuck is filming us,

715
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,810
they know what they're doing. Yeah.

716
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,660
That's what I got from you well was
cause I look at all the Shit I've been

717
00:40:07,661 --> 00:40:12,610
through. Yeah, you shut. That's
also your focus. Like you, you,

718
00:40:12,611 --> 00:40:16,720
you have a vision. Like it's
very clear that you're an artist.

719
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,250
Like when you're doing these videos,

720
00:40:18,251 --> 00:40:23,251
it's not simply you're filming things
like you're thinking about 100% about the

721
00:40:23,681 --> 00:40:27,350
angles, how to edit it, what,
what, you know, how to have a vote.

722
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:30,430
People talking, you hear their
voice while they're there,

723
00:40:30,431 --> 00:40:32,410
mounts not moving because
they're talking from another,

724
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:34,630
you know what I'm saying? Then
when you did narration? Yeah.

725
00:40:34,631 --> 00:40:38,920
When you see things that where someone
puts it together and like it makes it

726
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,910
richer, makes it more interesting.

727
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:44,430
And did you ever hear of a documentary
called Hoop Dreams? Yes, it was a,

728
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,500
that was my high school life.
Like they were older than me,

729
00:40:47,501 --> 00:40:50,060
but when I was in high school
that film came out, uh,

730
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,510
that fascinated me and I was like,

731
00:40:52,511 --> 00:40:55,720
I want a documentary and documented
somebody for five years, followed a life.

732
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:59,830
I was obsessed. And then my favorite
documentary of all time is pumping iron.

733
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,380
Oh, of course. So when I saw
that in college, I was like,

734
00:41:02,381 --> 00:41:06,400
I want to shoot documentaries. Ah. So I
was always obsessed with documentaries.

735
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:09,430
Like, I don't know if you remember back,
you remember banging in Little Rock?

736
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:13,660
Yes. Whew. Yes. That was an HBO,
right. Banging a little. All those,

737
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,690
that's what I like. I don't like
movies. I like documentary on me too.

738
00:41:16,691 --> 00:41:21,010
So for me, I've always was
obsessed with docs. I'm like,

739
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:24,310
if I can ever shoot a doc, I know
where that passion come from.

740
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:27,700
So when I literally moved to Florida,

741
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:31,510
like I literally just reached out to
Shannon Briggs one day. I was like,

742
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:34,100
cause I was doing weddings
and music, Saas make money,

743
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,330
especially with weddings.

744
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:38,480
I would make a lot of money with
weddings cause that's just, I mean,

745
00:41:38,481 --> 00:41:41,360
people get married every weekend.
Right? So I mean you can get,

746
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:44,840
and if you get good enough you can
get three, $4,000 a wedding video. So,

747
00:41:44,841 --> 00:41:48,320
I mean I'm booking two a week. I
started to get to a point where I'm,

748
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,680
let's go chair. That's one. Yeah,
that's the one of him. That's the one.

749
00:41:51,681 --> 00:41:54,650
So that was, that was three years
ago. The podcast I did with him. Yeah,

750
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:58,980
of course. Yeah. Here's court called
portrait of a boxing gym. Ah, yeah.

751
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:01,930
So like he's a fucking
care. Who is the guy. Dot.

752
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:06,080
Deontay Walder knocked out Bur
Berman. Starvation. Uh, yes.

753
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:10,220
The Vern stubborn. Yeah. That was the,
I remember he was in there that day.

754
00:42:10,221 --> 00:42:10,670
So I would,

755
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:13,930
I used to do stuff like this before I
ever decided to do anatomy and fight

756
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:18,020
daunted. Deontay wilder knocked out.
You've got to say everybody fought. Yeah,

757
00:42:18,021 --> 00:42:22,600
that's true. 40 knockouts. 41
upon the craziest fucking records.

758
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:27,290
Tyson fury too. Well, basically
10 seconds. Yeah. No you didn't.

759
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:28,820
That's my drink. Listen,

760
00:42:28,821 --> 00:42:33,821
if you ask me who my dream guest is
on anatomy of a fighter Deontay one,

761
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:37,760
I would love to do a behind the
scenes fight companion with you guys.

762
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:40,610
Just being here with the camera
filming y'all motherfuckers talking.

763
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:43,520
That's what the fight
companion is now. Now, now,

764
00:42:43,521 --> 00:42:46,880
but out in the hallways because
Eddie Bravo, bring them here.

765
00:42:46,881 --> 00:42:48,800
Bring some crazier seasoned. Well,

766
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:51,770
hopefully Eddie tried to
get away from hopefully.

767
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,520
Hopefully I get any bravo on the day
with cheeto. Veryyeah you'll get him on.

768
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:57,590
Yeah. More Cheetos fight
is canceled. Right? I know.

769
00:42:57,790 --> 00:42:59,690
So they tried to give him
a replacement opponent.

770
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,840
I was hoping that they shot
up to cheat over there. Yeah.

771
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:07,280
He love your show about I love him. Uh,
he, I'm tough motherfucker. He is. He a,

772
00:43:07,281 --> 00:43:11,150
I was hoping he got to not love
sugar shine. I love both of them.

773
00:43:11,151 --> 00:43:14,800
I love how he taken it to. Yeah,
he taken it because you know,

774
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,240
I seen a lot of people online
talking about, you know,

775
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:20,110
are they gonna move the car to
enter harm now? He was like, Nah,

776
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:22,400
they ain't doing that for chicken
shine. Don't know. He got a,

777
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:24,260
he got a tainted supplement. It's,

778
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:27,620
it's these new studies or
these new tests that they have.

779
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,770
They are so fucking extensive.

780
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:34,910
They catch shit that you
did years ago. That's crazy.

781
00:43:34,911 --> 00:43:38,570
And if you took a tainted supplement
with something that has zero performance

782
00:43:38,571 --> 00:43:41,960
benefit years ago, it can
still show up in your system.

783
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:45,020
Whereas they used to have like, oh,
it'll be out of your system in six weeks.

784
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:48,230
Like especially talk to like a gym
professor. Like there's a lot. Look,

785
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,720
there's a lot of cheating
in professional sports.

786
00:43:50,721 --> 00:43:52,710
There's a lot of cheating for sure. Like

787
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,600
a lot of cheating and MMA a lot,

788
00:43:57,050 --> 00:44:01,610
but less than they used to be because of
you Sada and Novitsky and what the UFC

789
00:44:01,611 --> 00:44:05,870
is implemented 100% there's a lot of less,
but supplements are a dirty business.

790
00:44:05,871 --> 00:44:09,500
I know this firsthand firm on it from
being one of the owners of on it and not

791
00:44:09,501 --> 00:44:12,770
even supplements tainted
with things that are illegal.

792
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:16,490
When we first started making Alpha
brain, we had it independently tested.

793
00:44:16,491 --> 00:44:19,100
We get all our shit third
party tested and we were like,

794
00:44:19,101 --> 00:44:20,480
what the fuck is this doing in there?

795
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:23,120
We had stuff in there that's not supposed
to be in there and well it turns out

796
00:44:23,121 --> 00:44:25,700
when you get stuff made,
like say if you have a,

797
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:27,980
you put together some sort of a,

798
00:44:27,981 --> 00:44:31,770
a pre-workout trick and you want to have
vitamin B 12 and all these different

799
00:44:31,771 --> 00:44:32,040
things

800
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:36,990
in it, you get those mixed
by a third party lab.

801
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:40,510
This lab mixes it all for you, but you
don't know what the fuck they're doing.

802
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:43,650
They're [inaudible], they're
not cleaning out their shit.

803
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:47,820
So they might've been doing steroids
right before they do your shit and you're

804
00:44:47,821 --> 00:44:52,110
having to make mix. You have some creotine
and your creatine has Austrian in it,

805
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:56,010
which is like, well what is it? Some
kind of steroid, I don't know what it is.

806
00:44:56,011 --> 00:44:56,910
It's some kind of steroid.

807
00:44:57,270 --> 00:45:00,570
I was talking to a bodybuilding micro
sheet about supplements cause you know,

808
00:45:00,571 --> 00:45:04,220
obviously he a bodybuilder and
he has a company, I think he,

809
00:45:04,221 --> 00:45:08,430
he works with trifecta too or something
like that. And I was just like, how do,

810
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:11,040
how does that happen? Like
these tenants supplements.

811
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:13,680
And I interviewed him about it.
I'm gonna release it one day,

812
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:15,990
how he goes into it. But you know,

813
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:18,560
with bodybuilders they catch
flack because they bodybuilders,

814
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,850
you've gotta be on something.
But these guys know they shit.

815
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:23,430
He has a legitimate business.
So I'm sure he does go.

816
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:27,660
Most of them are on something like if
you want to get to the size of like a Lee

817
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:31,950
Haney, you don't get that big without
steroids. It's not a human size.

818
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:34,950
You know when you get
to like, um, you know,

819
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:38,850
just go back and look at
like Franco Colombo. Oh Man.

820
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:43,410
Oh my God. You know, but, but then you
look at like Frank Zane, Frank Zane.

821
00:45:43,411 --> 00:45:46,560
You can get that body without
steroids. What about possible?

822
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:50,120
What about a Francis, Francis and Ghana.

823
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:53,840
If he started to be a bodybuilder,
he gotta be gigantic. Yeah,

824
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:57,150
there's naturally, there's natural
Komatsus. Mine is a freak. Yeah.

825
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:01,770
Woodley's they freaks. Rock listeners
are freak. There's freaks. There's, look,

826
00:46:01,771 --> 00:46:05,910
there's girls with giant tits. They're
born with triple f tits. Does that works?

827
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:08,670
Some guys have 20 inch decks.
This is just how the world works.

828
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:10,950
Some people have big
noses. The world's weird.

829
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:13,380
I wouldn't want to have a 20 inch
dick though. No, it's too big.

830
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:18,150
Imagine saying that. I'm too big. You
can't complain though. You can't complain.

831
00:46:18,151 --> 00:46:19,240
Eight and nine is good though.

832
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:21,290
You know how many dudes are crying
out there with a three inch deck?

833
00:46:21,291 --> 00:46:24,360
They'd be like, oh no.
17 more inches. Yeah,

834
00:46:24,361 --> 00:46:26,760
that's better off having a 20
inch stick than a three inch deck.

835
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:30,480
Did you just find a girls had
like eight kids and just record.

836
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:33,570
It'd be weird like, listen,
we want to know another,

837
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:38,190
another funny online story of my
life. These was all in the past,

838
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:42,690
but I remember dating this older lady
and she was like, Oh, I'm a freak.

839
00:46:42,691 --> 00:46:44,960
I'm a freak. I'm a freak.
And I was like, how much?

840
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:50,130
Like she went in her drawer and pulled
out like a Dildo that was like 20 inches.

841
00:46:50,131 --> 00:46:53,850
I was like, Oh, like a horse
cock. And I was just like,

842
00:46:53,851 --> 00:46:58,290
what the fuck am I do with this?
I did everything in my power drop.

843
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:04,260
She didn't feel shit. I
got mines though, Joe.

844
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:08,520
I believe you. I believe. Hey, some
weirdos out there, man. Oh, we all weird.

845
00:47:08,521 --> 00:47:10,710
In a way. Yes, everyone. We all listen.

846
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:15,620
Vegans are weird people that say
they don't drink or weird, uh,

847
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:19,740
people that only eat nuts
and berries, a weird,

848
00:47:19,741 --> 00:47:23,670
we always aware Christians are weird.
Can't judge nobody. I'll be like, oh,

849
00:47:23,671 --> 00:47:27,690
I never smoked a weed in my life.
But then I'd be online dating.

850
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:29,980
That's when Weirdos, she's
never smoked weed ever. Never.

851
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,510
Not one time, I'll come drink a
little bit, maybe five times a year.

852
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:39,910
How come you never smoked weed?
Um, I had an addictive family.

853
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:44,530
Uh, like I seen it and it was, it
was embarrassing and, and struggling.

854
00:47:44,531 --> 00:47:48,730
Like my mom was 14 years old when she
gave birth to me and my mom was born the

855
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:52,270
same month I am. So she was
born May 3rd are born May 19th.

856
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,310
So she could have had me at 13.

857
00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:58,330
My Dad was the same age so I didn't
grow up in any parents. Right.

858
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:02,590
I mean you know your parents, I hate
hearing it but I don't know my dad,

859
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:07,750
um, at all. I may have two on either.
I may have talked to him twice.

860
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,940
And the only, the last con, you know,

861
00:48:09,941 --> 00:48:11,710
the last conversation
I ever had with my dad,

862
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:15,430
he had got out of prison and I was
living with his mom. My Grandmother,

863
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:19,990
the one that raised me and
he like overtook the room
that I was living in cause

864
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:23,200
it's his room again. Like, I'm
a grown ass man telling his son,

865
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:28,270
oh Jason and I found his porn
tapes and me and my best friend,

866
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:30,970
like I knew, I was like, Yo,
you want to watch some porn?

867
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:33,940
So I like went up in the closet,
took out the tape, put it in,

868
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:35,920
and then I heard them coming in the house.

869
00:48:35,921 --> 00:48:40,150
So we ran and put the tape back and this
is how precise he was with his porn.

870
00:48:40,151 --> 00:48:43,270
Probably. He noticed some clothes
moves. So we like left the house.

871
00:48:43,271 --> 00:48:47,170
He came out the house, hey, stay out
of my room. I said, man, shut up.

872
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:49,390
You're a grown man watching
porn. It was my dad.

873
00:48:49,391 --> 00:48:51,940
That's like the last
conversation at Radford. Wow.

874
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:55,030
He had been in prison in and out his
life. That's the thing. It's like,

875
00:48:56,050 --> 00:49:00,580
listen man, everybody can pick, make
a picture out to be poor me. Yeah,

876
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:04,630
I don't, that's not me. You, me telling
you all this stuff ain't poor me.

877
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:09,160
It's just real. It's just life. Right.
Where I'm at now is beautiful. You know,

878
00:49:09,161 --> 00:49:13,600
I was filming videos to survive and then
I finally found something that stuck.

879
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:18,640
I never in my fucking life thought it
was going to be MMA. Never easy. Never.

880
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:19,600
So you,

881
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:23,170
you saw people with addiction problems
and you just didn't want to have anything

882
00:49:23,171 --> 00:49:27,010
to do with it? Nah, I just, yeah, I
just thought it was luckily for me, man,

883
00:49:27,011 --> 00:49:30,220
I found sports and in the fifth
grade and I just was upset.

884
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:34,360
I have an addictive personality, whether
there's masturbation or anything.

885
00:49:34,361 --> 00:49:37,900
Right. It was very similar
situation. You know what's crazy?

886
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:42,010
I've seen when he like what's fascinating
about this podcast is that if you go

887
00:49:42,011 --> 00:49:44,770
to your channel on Youtube and
you go to click oldest videos,

888
00:49:44,771 --> 00:49:48,130
that's why I'm not in a rush for
anything because everything takes time.

889
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:51,610
I looked at like one of your podcasts
with Eddie Bravo like three hours long.

890
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:56,050
He got like 11,000 views. Oh yeah, yeah.
Like 20,000 views. I want to say like,

891
00:49:56,051 --> 00:49:59,770
hey, how do I get paid from podcasts?
I'm like dude, them for six years. Yeah.

892
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,930
I didn't get paid at all for years.

893
00:50:01,931 --> 00:50:05,530
I mean this podcast is almost 10 years
old and I didn't really start getting

894
00:50:05,531 --> 00:50:08,860
paid like five years ago. And
it's fascinating to see that,

895
00:50:08,861 --> 00:50:12,970
like you go look at your oldest
videos, 20,000, 30,000 views. Yeah.

896
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:17,170
And that's the thing, like MMA fans are
fickle, right? They like who they like,

897
00:50:17,171 --> 00:50:19,690
they don't like, they like, it's
only about three or four fighters.

898
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:21,900
They could get a lot of
views, but then you tense.

899
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:25,570
It's that way with everything.
That's what I'm saying. Yeah.

900
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:30,290
And people are fascinated. Like
I'm lucky enough to know a Khabib.

901
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:32,000
Right. Or somebody like that.

902
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:35,930
Like I didn't know who this guy was
until Rashad Evans was like, Yo,

903
00:50:35,931 --> 00:50:38,120
let me introduce you to my Guy Ali.

904
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:43,090
And then I met Ali filming some
Henzel Gracie stuff for him. Um,

905
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:47,000
and he was like, Yo, I like you man.
Let me put you together with my fighter.

906
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:48,410
You know, who could be. And I was like,

907
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:51,620
is that they kind of fought Michael
Johnson. I didn't know who could be was.

908
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:52,161
He was like,

909
00:50:52,161 --> 00:50:55,970
I think y'all would be a good fit because
the way you do stories and stuff like

910
00:50:55,971 --> 00:50:58,150
that, I think you'll hear
like you and you're like him.

911
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:03,520
I literally met him of January
of last year of 2018 in Boston.

912
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:08,780
Um, and when Francis Find Steve Pay and
Vulcan was fighting DC and that was the

913
00:51:08,781 --> 00:51:12,430
first time I ever met her. And the rest
is history. I, I filmed him up there.

914
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:14,450
He was Finna fight Tony. Um,

915
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:18,590
then I found them during the
whole Connor fiasco, Al Quinta.

916
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:23,390
Then I went to Dagestan. I went to
Dagestan. What's that like? Intense.

917
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:24,440
But it was,

918
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:28,160
it was beautiful because people tried
to scare me when I was supposed to go to

919
00:51:28,161 --> 00:51:32,360
Dagestan who like I got people
in the UFC, they was like, Yo,

920
00:51:32,361 --> 00:51:33,200
be careful over there.

921
00:51:33,201 --> 00:51:36,200
I'm thinking like people that work for
the UFC just stand like, be careful.

922
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:40,520
Like, and I'm thinking to myself
like, am I dms on Instagram? Like Bro,

923
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,470
just be careful. They don't fucking
play over there. I was going through,

924
00:51:43,471 --> 00:51:47,420
I went during Ramadan last June
at the end of Ramadan. And uh,

925
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:50,830
did you have to observe
while you were there? So, uh,

926
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:55,190
could be wanting me to come during like
the last tail end of Ramadan. Right.

927
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:59,750
So I went over there, um, by myself.

928
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:04,340
Went and got my visa in Miami and went
over there, just got my ticket. And um,

929
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:07,550
I went over there. I remember
the first day I got there,

930
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:11,750
I was in like customs for like two hours
cause they couldn't speak English at

931
00:52:11,751 --> 00:52:12,660
this little airport in,

932
00:52:12,661 --> 00:52:17,661
in Dagestan and Cubby was outside and he
wouldn't come into the airport cause he

933
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:20,030
too famous. Right. And this
is in the middle of the night.

934
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:23,360
And I remember when I first got there, uh,

935
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:25,760
it was just checkpoints
everywhere when I got there.

936
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:28,770
Like we like drive down the street
person with some guns. I'm like,

937
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:32,900
alright cool. We're, I don't know where
we at but this is Dagestan. And um,

938
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:36,860
I ended up getting to this, this, I
stayed at his uncle house I think.

939
00:52:36,861 --> 00:52:39,140
And from there it was, it
was just a beautiful moment.

940
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,410
The Dagestan chronicles is my most
popular thing on my channel obviously,

941
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:45,220
cause it's Sean could be even a
way no one's ever seen them. Um,

942
00:52:45,350 --> 00:52:48,560
I observed Ramadan the whole time I was
there. I didn't eat, I didn't drink.

943
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:52,970
I did exactly what could be and them did
because I think a problem with us a lot

944
00:52:52,971 --> 00:52:57,140
as Americans is we take our
culture somewhere else and
I wanted to observe their

945
00:52:57,141 --> 00:52:59,120
culture and really see what it
was like and I was fascinated.

946
00:52:59,121 --> 00:53:03,200
I wanted to know why women
covered themselves and I
asked all those questions.

947
00:53:03,201 --> 00:53:06,980
All of that stuff is in the documentary
and now when I get all these millions of

948
00:53:06,981 --> 00:53:08,180
people watching these videos,

949
00:53:08,870 --> 00:53:11,450
the most common thing is like where
is the women at? And I'm like,

950
00:53:11,810 --> 00:53:13,830
why are these people so obsessed
with where the women at?

951
00:53:13,831 --> 00:53:17,030
And I literally went into that.
Like I asked like when you,

952
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:20,030
when these women are married, you
don't point a camera at these people.

953
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:24,290
Like I've seen women, you just don't
point a camera at them. It's rude. Right.

954
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:26,850
And that's like then their
culture and their culture.

955
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:31,680
Did they explain this to you? Did, what
did they say? They literally just said,

956
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,490
they look at w like I talked to a couple
of them, a couple of people over there,

957
00:53:35,491 --> 00:53:35,971
and he was just like,

958
00:53:35,971 --> 00:53:40,800
we look at our woman is women as
Queens and we cover him because in, in,

959
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:43,950
in, in the Koran is, you know,
the man is weak to the flesh.

960
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:49,160
So they don't want their
woman to be, you know,

961
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:52,680
looked at by other men things. Yeah.
That's the word I was looking for.

962
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:57,990
So you just covered themselves up. Um,
and in our culture that's, you know,

963
00:53:57,991 --> 00:54:02,280
they may be weird, but I respect it.
Like what they told me, it made sense.

964
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,620
It literally made sense where
it was just like, listen,

965
00:54:04,621 --> 00:54:07,260
we don't let another man
look at our wife. Right.

966
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:11,410
I'm not going to bash on that culture
because I feel like that's silly. I want,

967
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,100
we can do whatever they want to do.
That's just how they feel. Like I don't,

968
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:16,530
you know, so, but I seen women,

969
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:19,110
I seen some beautiful women
too while I was in Dagestan.

970
00:54:19,111 --> 00:54:22,740
So it wasn't the fact that I didn't
film any women. I seen women,

971
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:27,390
but they explained to you when you go
here, you cannot film the women. No, no,

972
00:54:27,391 --> 00:54:30,030
no. It was just, yeah, in a way,

973
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:32,700
like just don't film another man's woman.

974
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:36,990
Like I think I talked to Chris
Weiman once a, when I was at his gym,

975
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,400
when I was doing I laquinta he,
he went to Chechnya. Yeah. And uh,

976
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:42,510
he told me a story,

977
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:46,380
I think him and four of them went to
Chechnya and he was telling me a story of

978
00:54:46,381 --> 00:54:50,760
like, he accidentally touched
on woman's hand and uh,

979
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:53,670
they like literally got on like
you don't touch another woman,

980
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:57,880
you don't touch a woman's hand over
here cause that's bad on her. Right.

981
00:54:58,260 --> 00:54:59,900
And I was like, damn,
that's crazy you came.

982
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:04,230
Cause he said he was just like reaching
out, shaking people's hands, you know,

983
00:55:04,290 --> 00:55:07,830
human instinct, you reach and grab
somebody's hand. And he just said, man,

984
00:55:07,831 --> 00:55:09,870
that that's different culture over there.

985
00:55:09,871 --> 00:55:13,110
You see a woman can't touch
another man's hand. So yeah,

986
00:55:13,111 --> 00:55:17,820
that guy from Chechnya, the, the leader
of Chechnya, he's like really into MMA.

987
00:55:17,821 --> 00:55:20,040
Right? He flies no
people out yet. You know,

988
00:55:20,041 --> 00:55:24,630
what's crazy is that I don't know
anything about the guy or his politics or

989
00:55:24,631 --> 00:55:29,160
anything, but I know that he
obsessed with fighting. Right.

990
00:55:29,161 --> 00:55:33,060
I know Tyler Spong been over there
and why men and all these guys,

991
00:55:33,061 --> 00:55:36,360
I just met nick the tooth the
other day and they went up,

992
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:37,890
they went over there to Chechnya,

993
00:55:37,891 --> 00:55:42,420
him and amended his brother's
a there. That's the injury too.

994
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,160
Yeah, they had, I think the men,

995
00:55:44,161 --> 00:55:46,850
his brothers had like a
seminar or some seminar. I,

996
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:49,920
I did like a preview of Cheeto Vera
and he was talking about it and they're

997
00:55:49,921 --> 00:55:54,810
like, they did a Jujitsu match in
front of some oligarch over there.

998
00:55:54,811 --> 00:55:58,050
Like it's crazy. Right? Like they
flew him over there for that. Yeah.

999
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:02,850
That's got a lot of money. Yeah. OP, Hey,
I'm not even fighting these sponsors.

1000
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,240
Didn't need to give, could be like
some crazy Mercedes when he won.

1001
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,030
I think I started an
Instagram. You got like a gift.

1002
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:12,340
I think he gave him some crazy s-class
[inaudible] getting that Dubai money now

1003
00:56:12,350 --> 00:56:16,320
though, he always in Dubai. Listen, I
mean, since it's fight, even in Dubai,

1004
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:20,100
how many times, what's he doing over
there? Speaking, things like that. I mean,

1005
00:56:20,101 --> 00:56:21,060
when you one of the most famous,

1006
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:25,390
I think he's like top 15 and most
famous athletes now. Both for sure.

1007
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:29,110
And definitely the most famous
Muslim athlete. Yeah. Yes.

1008
00:56:29,111 --> 00:56:33,010
So I mean he the only UFC champion
that's undefeated other than John Jones,

1009
00:56:33,011 --> 00:56:35,980
who should be undefeated if
it not for that one. Listen,

1010
00:56:35,981 --> 00:56:37,240
fucked up disqualification.

1011
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:40,660
I have to spend a time what could be
been daggy Stan like me and his father

1012
00:56:40,661 --> 00:56:43,570
going into the mountains and things like,
I just don't see nobody beating him.

1013
00:56:43,571 --> 00:56:45,490
I'm sorry, what you throw at
them? You don't walk away.

1014
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:48,610
I just feel like just his
pedigree of where he from,

1015
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:52,540
it's nothing that's going to
break that guy. It's you can't,

1016
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:55,630
what are you going to do it? I just
don't think there's nothing you can do.

1017
00:56:55,631 --> 00:56:59,230
After going to Dagestan and seeing how
those people live and how that Derrick,

1018
00:56:59,231 --> 00:57:04,060
their code and their values and how
they live. What was so convincing?

1019
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:04,810
Well,

1020
00:57:04,810 --> 00:57:09,810
just how strict that faith is over there.

1021
00:57:10,481 --> 00:57:13,450
Right? And they tie in everything
they do to their faith.

1022
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:15,130
It's sort of like how Ali was like,

1023
00:57:15,131 --> 00:57:17,530
I'm not going to lose because
I lie and things like that.

1024
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:21,970
And I truly believe that after seeing
like just the camaraderie over there,

1025
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:26,200
the gyms they train in the mountains,
everything that makes this guy,

1026
00:57:26,201 --> 00:57:30,730
it's nothing in the octagon that someone
is going to do like this is going to

1027
00:57:30,731 --> 00:57:33,310
beat. Could be like everything
can happen, a fluke can happen.

1028
00:57:33,311 --> 00:57:34,360
We see it all the time.

1029
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:38,530
But I just feel like mentally there's
nothing that's gonna Break Khabib.

1030
00:57:38,531 --> 00:57:42,550
Like if, I feel like if he was ever
in a situation where he had to tap,

1031
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:45,910
he wouldn't like he would, he would
just have to put him to sleep.

1032
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:49,180
Cause I just don't think that's
possible. Like to beat him.

1033
00:57:49,181 --> 00:57:51,850
I honestly feel like it
could be, you can't lose,

1034
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:54,160
I just don't see nobody
beating him. I just,

1035
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:58,040
I've been in locker rooms are
fighters and you got a butterfly.

1036
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:59,140
I fell in and things like that.

1037
00:57:59,141 --> 00:58:03,280
Like when he fought Connor and I
was in a locker room, could be,

1038
00:58:03,281 --> 00:58:07,300
was facetiming his people in Dagestan
laughing and Javier Mendez is like,

1039
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:10,750
let's get focused, let's get
focused, let's get focused. Could be,

1040
00:58:10,751 --> 00:58:15,290
he was not caring. Wow. Could be
just ready to go. Right. When, uh,

1041
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:16,990
Tony Ferguson was fighting pedis,

1042
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:21,250
he like hitting Mitts with Javier and I
could be just looking up to the screen.

1043
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:25,930
Javier is like, let's get folks like
his focus can be, you don't care man.

1044
00:58:25,931 --> 00:58:28,630
It's a different level. He always
said that's like his favorite thing.

1045
00:58:28,631 --> 00:58:31,120
This is a different level and
that's what I love about him, man.

1046
00:58:31,121 --> 00:58:33,220
It's like people are
obsessed with the fighter.

1047
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:38,080
I like to beaver as a person and that's
the thing that I get out of this anatomy

1048
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:41,200
of a fighter. It's like just
hanging out with his guy.

1049
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:43,270
But like if you ever watch my series,

1050
00:58:43,271 --> 00:58:45,760
I never really talk about
a guy's fight coming up.

1051
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:49,510
Like if you ever watch anatomy and
fight, it's not about your opponent,

1052
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:54,130
it's just about your life. Because I
felt like when I created it, I felt like

1053
00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:58,870
these organizations wasn't promoting
fighters all the way and not, yeah,

1054
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,690
they gonna promote the top
fighters and things like that.

1055
00:59:01,691 --> 00:59:06,691
But what about the guys that are two and
one in the UFC not ranked like they in

1056
00:59:06,990 --> 00:59:09,910
the UFC. Like they may get
cut after a couple of fights,

1057
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:12,520
like what did they have left
after that? And I was just like,

1058
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:17,680
let me create the series instead of a
documentary and just continue to build

1059
00:59:17,681 --> 00:59:20,860
this and follow these guys' lives.
And that's all I really wanted to do.

1060
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:23,060
It was no hidden incentive
where I was like,

1061
00:59:23,061 --> 00:59:24,650
I'm gonna make millions
of dollars off this.

1062
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:27,350
I'm going to end up on the Joe
Rogan podcast. It was like,

1063
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:31,070
I love following these fighters and
telling their stories because it's sorta

1064
00:59:31,071 --> 00:59:33,890
like similar to my journey,
you know, these guys are,

1065
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:39,140
what was the guy that just fought,
um, Dhahran win in Greenville?

1066
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:43,730
Eric Spicy or spice Lee or whatever his
name was. He tweeted like, oh, I had,

1067
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:46,100
he just got, they got fighting
in the night. He was like,

1068
00:59:46,101 --> 00:59:49,220
I had two minus two 70
in my bank account. Yeah,

1069
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:52,800
I been there Joe. So that's why I,

1070
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:56,480
I'd get the passion out of doing it
cause I been there with these fighters.

1071
00:59:56,650 --> 00:59:59,420
I at this point in my life,
I've paid for fighters,

1072
00:59:59,421 --> 01:00:01,790
flights and hotels because
they couldn't get a hotel.

1073
01:00:01,791 --> 01:00:05,300
Like these fighters know that some of
these fighters know that to where I'm able

1074
01:00:05,301 --> 01:00:09,170
to help them. And I, I'm finding
this all on my own breaking myself.

1075
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,071
So I'm to me,

1076
01:00:10,071 --> 01:00:14,150
I'm just thinking about myself like
you doing this for a specific reason,

1077
01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:17,480
you passionate about it and you want to
tell these guys' lives and I just really

1078
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:21,440
want it to offer another glimpse into
fighter slots other than fight week.

1079
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:24,650
And Are you getting paid
from Youtube revenue? Yeah,

1080
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:28,720
my account is moaning to not Mona
Tonies and verify. Yeah. Monitor,

1081
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:32,720
monetized and verified.
And depending on a month,

1082
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:36,140
it can be a good month.
It can be a bad month. Um,

1083
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,530
it's surprising to me. I
haven't got a sponsor yet.

1084
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:44,450
Like it's popular as the channel is,
but it is what it is now. Probably.

1085
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:45,290
Who knows.

1086
01:00:45,290 --> 01:00:48,650
I mean shout out to like people like
eight minutes strong like you know,

1087
01:00:49,110 --> 01:00:52,190
then that's Ryan Bader. Stephanie. Yeah,
that's Ryan Bader. Shout out to Adam,

1088
01:00:52,191 --> 01:00:53,600
the owner of it and his brother,

1089
01:00:53,601 --> 01:00:57,050
like they was the first people to
ever send me stuff like t shirts.

1090
01:00:57,050 --> 01:01:01,460
I was just happy. I was like, damn, I
got some free gear. Right? Like man.

1091
01:01:01,461 --> 01:01:04,970
Finally I remember seeing they shirts
back when I first started with Kamala

1092
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:08,780
whose mom was wearing stuff. And
you know, companies like that,

1093
01:01:08,781 --> 01:01:10,400
you get money here and there from them,

1094
01:01:10,401 --> 01:01:14,180
but like to sustain this like member
fight land, remember to show white land.

1095
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:18,200
I heard they went out of business
because the funding wasn't advice.

1096
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:19,410
It's something like that.

1097
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:22,130
It's company because out they went
out of business because of funding.

1098
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:26,660
Vice probably just decided to stop
doing it. Listen Joe, you travel.

1099
01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:30,710
But vice's a billion dollar company.
That's true. What they believe.

1100
01:01:30,711 --> 01:01:35,420
Fight landers advice show, isn't
it? What's fun up? Yeah, pretty,

1101
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:38,060
pretty sure fight. Lynn was vice.

1102
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:43,480
If you flew to Phoenix for
three days to do comedy,

1103
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:49,490
um, and get a hotel and you know
how expensive flight and like,

1104
01:01:49,491 --> 01:01:52,700
so imagine me funding this on my own if
I want to go somewhere for three days,

1105
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:55,370
especially Dagestan yeah, shit like that.

1106
01:01:55,370 --> 01:01:58,090
And where are you staying when your
entire staff? I was staying with US state.

1107
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:01,280
It could be Eve's family house.
Oh Wow. Yeah. So I stayed a,

1108
01:02:01,281 --> 01:02:05,510
they put me like above
a store and he told me,

1109
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:08,780
he gave me a key. He was like,
brother locked this door at night,

1110
01:02:08,781 --> 01:02:12,200
brother Jesus Christ. He
was like, don't go outside.

1111
01:02:13,490 --> 01:02:16,850
I still went outside. Did you?
Yeah, I still went outside. You Go.

1112
01:02:16,910 --> 01:02:19,800
I just was roaming like walking
around, just filming stuff.

1113
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:22,270
What's it like out in Dagestan
when you're roaming the street?

1114
01:02:22,310 --> 01:02:23,820
They never really seen
black people over there.

1115
01:02:23,821 --> 01:02:26,610
So I was like a little celebrity
over there and you're a big one.

1116
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:29,470
And they know I'm from, I'm Waco
Beach, so I was cool with that.

1117
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:33,510
So they knew that. Yeah. You know,
you get me. Yeah. They was Chitlin.

1118
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:37,050
Did they speak English? A couple
people did. Yeah. A couple people did.

1119
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:40,410
Did they ask you questions? Yeah, they
asked me questions. They, you know, they,

1120
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:43,890
they obviously I had already been with
Khabib at that time, you know, I was,

1121
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:47,460
that was past the Conor
McGregor fiasco. So you know,

1122
01:02:47,461 --> 01:02:49,680
my channel get popular cause
it's something like that.

1123
01:02:49,830 --> 01:02:53,610
And they just watched anything
could be related. Could be,

1124
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:57,600
you've got some crazy fans, man. How
many people live in Duggan style? Man,

1125
01:02:57,601 --> 01:03:00,280
I don't know Jimmy. Pull that up. I said,

1126
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:02,670
just want to say that

1127
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:08,040
I saw some of the videos of people
celebrating when he wanted it was fucking

1128
01:03:08,041 --> 01:03:08,874
crazy, man.

1129
01:03:08,930 --> 01:03:13,320
It was treats are honking their horns
and when he won the title or when he econ

1130
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:18,180
or would it be Connor? And that was
crazy. 2.9 million. Yeah. Okay, cool.

1131
01:03:18,450 --> 01:03:22,440
So, um, so it's your, you're, it's a city,

1132
01:03:22,441 --> 01:03:25,560
but it's essentially like this
big, the mountains. Yeah, it's big.

1133
01:03:26,190 --> 01:03:29,520
The mountains are like right next to
it or something like sorta like when we

1134
01:03:29,521 --> 01:03:33,030
went to his mountain village, we had
to drive like two hours to get there.

1135
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:36,190
Oh really? Yeah. Like we had to
go on the borders of Chesney.

1136
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:39,870
I had to get another visa. Oh Wow.
Just to get through that checkpoint.

1137
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:42,810
I'll never forget like we got
to the checkpoint and they like,

1138
01:03:42,811 --> 01:03:45,990
we had the all give them my stuff
and it could be a, it could be,

1139
01:03:45,991 --> 01:03:50,991
it was like get out and the dude was like
get out the army guy with his gun and

1140
01:03:51,811 --> 01:03:54,480
then I get out and I come
around the car and could be,

1141
01:03:54,481 --> 01:03:57,720
he was like get your camera brother.
Right. And then he was like,

1142
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:00,400
they want to take a picture with
you with the camera. I was like,

1143
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:03,880
God what the Hell Y'all about to do? Yeah,

1144
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:07,050
I call it like a bad case of diarrhea
while I was over there cause I eat nothing

1145
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:11,610
but meat. I was trying to do
Quito, I was over there and listen,

1146
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:15,600
the toilets are just a hole in the
ground. Do you have to squat? Yeah,

1147
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:17,400
you got to squat and pull
the string or whatever.

1148
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:21,370
So I remember like we was
driving from his village at the,

1149
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:26,370
that was like my last night there and
I called like I was always destroyed.

1150
01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:27,450
I was like,

1151
01:04:27,450 --> 01:04:32,100
we got two hours and we like stopped a
couple of times to eat and pray and all

1152
01:04:32,101 --> 01:04:33,270
that stuff. Like, you know,

1153
01:04:33,990 --> 01:04:37,500
and I remember like I was suffering and
could be like filming me with his phone,

1154
01:04:37,501 --> 01:04:39,150
laughing, looking at his
brother, look at his brother,

1155
01:04:39,151 --> 01:04:40,140
he's about to shoot and said,

1156
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:45,780
and I remember getting back to the place
where I was standing Dagestan oh my

1157
01:04:45,781 --> 01:04:49,560
God, I probably lost like eight
pounds. It was crazy, man.

1158
01:04:49,561 --> 01:04:53,160
It was a crazy experience, man. It
was a crazy experience in Dagestan.

1159
01:04:53,161 --> 01:04:55,410
That's life changing. It changed my
life. How long were you there for?

1160
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:01,500
Nine days. Wow. It changed
my life. Really? Yeah,

1161
01:05:01,501 --> 01:05:05,760
because when you, in this type of
industry, everybody materialistic.

1162
01:05:05,761 --> 01:05:09,510
We all want nice things. We want to live
in Nice places, on to drive nice cars.

1163
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:10,553
I do.

1164
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:14,940
Most people do want to live nice and
comfortable and I saw just how happy these

1165
01:05:14,941 --> 01:05:18,190
people was just living their
lives. Like, went to his village,

1166
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:22,730
I went to his mountain village and I was
in a city and I saw these people were

1167
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:25,900
just happy and maybe on,

1168
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:29,380
on the outside they was happy and maybe
they was dealing with other things that

1169
01:05:29,381 --> 01:05:30,250
we don't know about.

1170
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:34,950
But I saw familiness brotherhood and I,

1171
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,510
I had a little bit of
respect for their culture.

1172
01:05:37,511 --> 01:05:40,210
Like obviously with Islam
and things like that,

1173
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:42,940
there's so many different
sex that makes it bad.

1174
01:05:42,941 --> 01:05:44,360
Just like with Christianity and,

1175
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:47,710
and people in the Catholic community
and the priest and everything.

1176
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:52,720
And that's my experience with the
Islamic community being around cubby.

1177
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:54,760
So that's the only thing
that I can go off of.

1178
01:05:54,761 --> 01:05:58,330
And obviously everybody see Muhammad
Ali and he praises and things like that.

1179
01:05:58,331 --> 01:06:02,150
But um, I had a new found respect, uh,

1180
01:06:02,290 --> 01:06:05,920
for just the simpleness
of, of that, like a beep.

1181
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:07,450
I thought honestly it could be,

1182
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:10,840
it was going to retire after he fought
Connor cause I talked to him a little bit

1183
01:06:10,841 --> 01:06:14,710
about that and cause he don't want much.

1184
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,960
What did he say after
the color fat? No, no,

1185
01:06:16,961 --> 01:06:19,330
before the kind of fight before
he was, he was just like,

1186
01:06:19,331 --> 01:06:23,830
what do you think about, uh, me retiring
after the Conor fight? I was like, man,

1187
01:06:23,831 --> 01:06:26,300
you do what you want to do. I can't
tell you. He was like, I mean,

1188
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:29,170
I'm gonna have money. What
else do I need to do? Right.

1189
01:06:29,710 --> 01:06:31,810
Because he obviously knew that
was going to be the biggest,

1190
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:36,430
the biggest fight ever. So at the IFC
make for that fight, I don't know.

1191
01:06:37,210 --> 01:06:38,920
Well remember they took his check, right?

1192
01:06:38,950 --> 01:06:43,300
But obviously he got a lot money for
that. They gave him a con counter.

1193
01:06:43,301 --> 01:06:46,240
I think Conner had $4 million
check and it could be,

1194
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:49,740
had a $2 million check and then obviously
they had the paper viewpoints. Right.

1195
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:54,340
So I was like, damn, where my money
yet? I promoted the things match.

1196
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:58,030
You should've definitely unpaid for that.
Listen, you know what's funny is that,

1197
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:01,510
uh, somebody asked me a long, it was like,

1198
01:07:01,570 --> 01:07:05,470
if you got anything out of this whole
thing, what would you want? I'd be like,

1199
01:07:05,650 --> 01:07:09,130
I camera, let's go get a new camera so
I could shoot some movies or something.

1200
01:07:09,131 --> 01:07:13,780
Right. That's literally
the low expectations I had
out of making the series.

1201
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:17,590
Right. Especially when there was a
documentary. I was just like, man,

1202
01:07:17,591 --> 01:07:18,670
maybe I'll make this documentary,

1203
01:07:18,671 --> 01:07:22,720
put it on Netflix or Amazon for free
about fighters and now looking back on it,

1204
01:07:22,810 --> 01:07:25,030
the stuff that I have
captured on him, hard drives,

1205
01:07:25,031 --> 01:07:28,600
I can sell a documentary for
millions of dollars. I think I got

1206
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:31,540
Mazin footage I got,

1207
01:07:31,810 --> 01:07:35,240
I got the whole Connor
thing that I got like that.

1208
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:38,740
That tape is like 20 minutes.
Nobody's ever seen it. I have it.

1209
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:41,800
No one's really seen the whole thing.

1210
01:07:42,070 --> 01:07:44,640
Like I got Connor when he
first ran down the tunnel like,

1211
01:07:44,650 --> 01:07:46,090
cause I seen him from a distance.

1212
01:07:46,450 --> 01:07:51,040
I wonder if the UFC would be against you
putting that out or pro you put nothing

1213
01:07:51,041 --> 01:07:55,570
out because well I put it
out on my channel a snippet
and then at the end of it

1214
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:58,510
going to happen. I was like watch the
full episode on embedded right. I,

1215
01:07:58,511 --> 01:08:03,511
I gave them their just do and then they
literally told me like all we'll give

1216
01:08:04,511 --> 01:08:07,180
you credit. I never got credit. Uh,

1217
01:08:07,210 --> 01:08:11,530
I was just hoping they put shout out the
anatomy of a fighter for helping us get

1218
01:08:11,531 --> 01:08:15,040
this footage. I never got that.
They should have either way.

1219
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:18,210
You're getting it now. Yeah.
So here we are man. And Yeah,

1220
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:22,240
you know like going from the first day
I walked into that gym and saying C'mon

1221
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:27,240
Ooze my toe filming him for two years
and all the way to the title when I used

1222
01:08:27,381 --> 01:08:30,770
to post videos of Camarillo Guzman on
the channel and he'd get 4,000 views and

1223
01:08:30,771 --> 01:08:32,750
people like, why are
you posting this bomb?

1224
01:08:32,910 --> 01:08:35,750
I'm thinking to myself
like these fans are crazy.

1225
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:39,380
He can't pay attention to that. Those
are just, it's hard John. Even the fans,

1226
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:43,040
it's hard. It's trolled. It's a
tiny amount of lose. It's crazy.

1227
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:44,810
Cause I love the MMA fans.

1228
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:48,800
I'm close to the line that the last time
you were here we were talking about the

1229
01:08:48,830 --> 01:08:52,370
comments. You can't read it. You
can't, it'll drive you fucking crazy.

1230
01:08:52,610 --> 01:08:54,590
Cause the people that want to
comment and want to fuck with you.

1231
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:57,920
It's the smallest number,
the loudest, the most vocal.

1232
01:08:58,130 --> 01:09:01,130
And they have the shittiest lives. No
one with a good life wants to do that.

1233
01:09:01,390 --> 01:09:01,800
No one,

1234
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:06,380
no one is happy and healthy wants to
fuck with you and say it's crazy when you

1235
01:09:06,381 --> 01:09:08,990
put your time and effort into
something, like say for example,

1236
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:09,890
I flew to Phoenix,

1237
01:09:09,891 --> 01:09:14,510
film shine and film Bader and
then you spend all these hours,

1238
01:09:14,511 --> 01:09:17,450
10 hours editing something and then you
put it on and then somebody like this.

1239
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:21,380
That dude sucks. It's like damn man,
you appreciating what I'm doing.

1240
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:23,150
Are you just trolling
you talking tomorrow?

1241
01:09:23,490 --> 01:09:26,420
I mean you're reading
the thoughts of morons.

1242
01:09:26,450 --> 01:09:29,180
You're reading the thoughts of
limited minds. That's all it is.

1243
01:09:29,181 --> 01:09:31,280
It's really that simple. Yeah, it's nuts.

1244
01:09:31,310 --> 01:09:33,560
Anybody who thought the come
out loose mine was a bum.

1245
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:37,910
I knew whose mom was a murderer years
ago. I just saw him fight years ago.

1246
01:09:37,911 --> 01:09:40,430
I want, nobody wants to fight
that. I know I used to put your,

1247
01:09:40,670 --> 01:09:43,430
I used to love taking
snippets of your podcast,

1248
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:47,810
your voice cause you just that narration
voice and putting it with stuff and

1249
01:09:47,811 --> 01:09:51,140
like you can be like, oh that was a
universe pulling us together. But no,

1250
01:09:51,141 --> 01:09:53,780
I just was like this goes with this.

1251
01:09:54,420 --> 01:09:56,780
Like I like when you
and Shab are together.

1252
01:09:56,840 --> 01:10:00,740
I love that because y'all able to bounce
ideas cause obviously his experience

1253
01:10:00,741 --> 01:10:03,170
with the fight game and then your
experience with the fight game,

1254
01:10:03,171 --> 01:10:06,380
y'all able to bounce a
debate and things like that.

1255
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:08,060
And I'm like that's a good mix.

1256
01:10:08,061 --> 01:10:12,200
Like a lot of people go in on a episode
I did at a weigh ins with Connor and

1257
01:10:12,201 --> 01:10:16,430
Khabib and it was like you and shop
talking and that's just the narration shot

1258
01:10:16,431 --> 01:10:20,440
of how I do film because that's what I
love about document sports documentaries

1259
01:10:20,441 --> 01:10:24,350
is narration and that's how I get
it. I get so many people that like,

1260
01:10:24,740 --> 01:10:27,890
oh I want to, I'm trying to do the
same thing you're doing. And I'm like,

1261
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:32,250
don't try to be anatomy of a
fighter. Right? Like, if I,

1262
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:35,300
if I'm filming one fighter, this a
thousand other fighters, not just,

1263
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:38,330
I don't want to just do UFC, I want
to do better. I want to do one,

1264
01:10:38,331 --> 01:10:41,660
I want to do boxing. That's why I was,
I was trying to say earlier, my goal,

1265
01:10:41,690 --> 01:10:44,630
I would love to do it anatomy or
Deontay log. I bet you could do it.

1266
01:10:44,810 --> 01:10:48,680
I bet you I tried to get, I had
Andy Ruiz and, and they did.

1267
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:52,340
So what happened was micro, she
reached out to me and was like, Hey,

1268
01:10:52,370 --> 01:10:56,120
do you want to do Andy Ruiz? I was
like, I'm thinking John Ruiz, right?

1269
01:10:56,150 --> 01:11:00,980
So I'm like junior, junior, or
senior, right. And he was like, no,

1270
01:11:00,981 --> 01:11:04,160
the guy that replaced big baby Miller
and that's one of my good friends,

1271
01:11:04,161 --> 01:11:08,600
big baby Miller. And uh, he was like,
yeah, man, he's fighting Joshua now.

1272
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:12,290
He got a good chance. I had posted on my
Instagram like a text message from him.

1273
01:11:12,590 --> 01:11:16,140
He was like, man, it'd be
a good opportunity because
I think he can really beat,

1274
01:11:17,230 --> 01:11:18,750
uh, Joshua. And he did.

1275
01:11:18,751 --> 01:11:23,580
And I missed out c those are the moments
like the Connor Dolly thing is key

1276
01:11:23,581 --> 01:11:26,970
moments in film like this
viral nation that you need to,

1277
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:30,630
that's why I film everybody. I
found these guys. It's not popular.

1278
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:34,590
Things like that because these guys may
be the champions one day and I want to

1279
01:11:34,591 --> 01:11:37,410
be like I was there at the
beginning and that's the,

1280
01:11:37,411 --> 01:11:41,860
that's the thrill you get out of it,
if anything. Right? Yeah, and I've,

1281
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:46,030
I filmed the pseudos, I filmed the
ooze. Mine's a film that could be,

1282
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:48,960
I've been in locker rooms
with the title winners.

1283
01:11:48,961 --> 01:11:50,700
I've been in there when invoking loss.

1284
01:11:50,860 --> 01:11:54,110
Well you were telling me
some great footage that you
got that you wouldn't have

1285
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:57,290
gotten that store wouldn't have
got out about pseudo about.

1286
01:11:57,390 --> 01:11:59,540
So Hutto coming back from
the Olympic gold medal,

1287
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:03,920
winning the Olympics in wrestling and
then fucking living in the gym to,

1288
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:04,670
to win the golden.

1289
01:12:04,670 --> 01:12:07,160
That's crazy. Crazy. I never knew that.

1290
01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:09,530
That's the ecstasy I get
out of filming these guys.

1291
01:12:09,531 --> 01:12:13,430
Like you hear these little stories and
I was like, you never talk about that.

1292
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:17,300
Right? Like, you know, he's running with
the whole heel of the gold metal thing.

1293
01:12:17,830 --> 01:12:20,170
Well, he's doing some
weird shit now. He's like,

1294
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:23,140
he's calling himself the king
of cringe. What is that about?

1295
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:27,170
Well, because people was calling them
cringy like just, you know how they, they,

1296
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:28,600
they rake on Luke Rockhold

1297
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:32,550
the triple c now, now
triple c, he'd run away.

1298
01:12:33,330 --> 01:12:37,560
He liked the Mexican Colby. Covington.
Well, you better be careful what he is.

1299
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:41,880
Is he a beast though? His
mind is just unstoppable.

1300
01:12:41,970 --> 01:12:46,110
The fact that Marlon fucked him up like
that in that first round and was chewing

1301
01:12:46,111 --> 01:12:48,030
his legs out. I mean, I did not think,

1302
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:49,420
and it looked like he
was going to get k out.

1303
01:12:49,710 --> 01:12:51,210
It looked like he couldn't
close the distance.

1304
01:12:51,390 --> 01:12:56,370
Marlin looked calm and comfortable and
super professional and then a flip switch

1305
01:12:56,790 --> 01:12:59,850
switch, flipped. And then the second
round came around. And so who knows,

1306
01:12:59,851 --> 01:13:02,160
just walk at him down and
closing the distance. Then.

1307
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:04,020
Then he gets him in the clinch
and lands knees. I'm like,

1308
01:13:04,021 --> 01:13:05,190
this is like a fucking movie.

1309
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:08,850
That's Eric Albertson and Santina and
the Franco and all those guys over there.

1310
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:13,800
Uh, that fight ready has something
to do with those guys. You know,

1311
01:13:13,801 --> 01:13:16,620
when he lost it, I did not
know when he lost the DJ.

1312
01:13:18,150 --> 01:13:22,140
So who though was lost? He went on
a whole world tour to find himself.

1313
01:13:22,141 --> 01:13:23,670
He went to Thailand. He went to Brazil.

1314
01:13:23,671 --> 01:13:26,910
He was trained in everywhere
after he lost it the first time.

1315
01:13:27,090 --> 01:13:29,460
And that's those little
stories right there.

1316
01:13:29,461 --> 01:13:33,120
Like he felt like as he needed to
get better as a martial artist,

1317
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:38,290
he said, I mean with DJ at
the time, it's arguable now.

1318
01:13:38,291 --> 01:13:41,260
Who's the best? It's like him or
John Right now he's at one FC.

1319
01:13:41,261 --> 01:13:44,260
It's a totally different
ballgame. But with DJ was,

1320
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:47,550
was the most complete package
we'd ever seen the most. The,

1321
01:13:47,551 --> 01:13:51,310
the guy who you couldn't hit, you
could hit you, he could wrestle you,

1322
01:13:51,370 --> 01:13:53,440
he could submit you, he
could strike with you.

1323
01:13:53,441 --> 01:13:57,190
He had incredible footwork and
speed. I mean, DJ was just perfect.

1324
01:13:57,191 --> 01:13:59,890
And that night he just found that
opening just fucked him out with these,

1325
01:13:59,891 --> 01:14:02,440
the body. I mean, DJ man,

1326
01:14:02,470 --> 01:14:05,700
there was moments in DJ's career where
I remember watching him and calling his

1327
01:14:05,710 --> 01:14:07,750
fights. I'm like, God
damn this dude special.

1328
01:14:08,170 --> 01:14:09,580
It's like something about what he's doing.

1329
01:14:09,581 --> 01:14:12,020
He's so far ahead of
everybody in the division

1330
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:16,960
so far. I'm about to go up to Seattle or
Kirkland [inaudible] sample for one FC.

1331
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:21,070
Concentrate on mad. He man, human's
a bad mother fucker. Oh my God.

1332
01:14:21,310 --> 01:14:24,760
He's got such a deep knowledge
and understanding of the sport.

1333
01:14:24,761 --> 01:14:28,840
You ever see him fight? No.
Mad Him stopped, uh, Pat
Miletich back in that day.

1334
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:33,520
He saw pat, he, he, what did he, who
did he submit? Kenny Johnson. He,

1335
01:14:33,910 --> 01:14:36,910
I forget who it was in one of
those. Um, they, they used to have,

1336
01:14:36,911 --> 01:14:40,030
they had a professional submission,
grappling pay per view event.

1337
01:14:40,031 --> 01:14:44,450
At one point in time. Frank shamrock
submitted Dan Henderson and um,

1338
01:14:44,620 --> 01:14:48,610
Matt Hume was a fucking straight
up killer. I mean, he was a really,

1339
01:14:48,611 --> 01:14:52,630
really good world-class mixed
martial artist back when nobody was,

1340
01:14:52,870 --> 01:14:56,620
he had excellent Moitai excellent
submissions. He was good at everything.

1341
01:14:56,650 --> 01:15:00,100
How has, how has this
Seattle MMAC well, I mean,

1342
01:15:00,101 --> 01:15:01,870
there's been great guys to come from it.

1343
01:15:01,870 --> 01:15:05,500
Like Josh Barnett and of course
mighty mouse being the biggest one.

1344
01:15:05,530 --> 01:15:08,200
It's not as big as say like Miami,

1345
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:11,050
like where you're at in
south Florida. That's,

1346
01:15:11,110 --> 01:15:15,520
that's the biggest problem I live
in south Florida. That was that,

1347
01:15:15,610 --> 01:15:20,410
I mean Blackzilians and American top
team on one spot and then a plethora of

1348
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:23,320
world-class Jujitsu
around that area. I mean,

1349
01:15:23,321 --> 01:15:28,240
and then also world-class boxing
obviously mean that's where I'm, I mean,

1350
01:15:28,241 --> 01:15:32,020
I'm, what the fuck is his name? Sugary
linens trainer. Muhammad Ali's trainer.

1351
01:15:32,740 --> 01:15:36,390
I'm the old guy. Custom model.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1352
01:15:37,210 --> 01:15:40,540
The older guy who said to us, no,
no, no. You're blowing it son.

1353
01:15:40,850 --> 01:15:44,940
Fuck is his name. The old
Italian guy. Fuck this.

1354
01:15:45,220 --> 01:15:47,350
I remember saying, I can't
believe I can't remember his name.

1355
01:15:47,351 --> 01:15:51,460
This is embarrassing. Um,
sugarrae Leonard's boxing trainer.

1356
01:15:52,090 --> 01:15:55,840
Angelo. Angelo. Dundee. Yeah.
Angelo Dundee. Yeah. Blowing it kid.

1357
01:15:56,110 --> 01:15:59,320
When he comes out and stops Tommy Hearns
the next round. That's crazy. That was,

1358
01:15:59,321 --> 01:16:02,310
that was a, that was Miami. Denver said,

1359
01:16:02,650 --> 01:16:06,560
I'm not going to be in la long
like la or not. You're a gypsy man.

1360
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:11,770
So my whole thing is,
honestly, Joe, I need to,

1361
01:16:11,771 --> 01:16:14,440
I want to settle somewhere though.
What do you want? Settle Danvers.

1362
01:16:15,210 --> 01:16:16,870
This is that. This is
all was going to ask you.

1363
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:21,490
So these are the three cities I'm
thinking about to settle for maybe a few

1364
01:16:21,490 --> 01:16:26,230
years, four years back. The
San Diego, Denver, and Seattle.

1365
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:31,000
Which one should I choose? I would say
San Diego or Denver. I love Seattle.

1366
01:16:31,001 --> 01:16:35,440
But that went or that rainy
season can suck my deck.

1367
01:16:35,740 --> 01:16:36,573
You can't do it.

1368
01:16:36,930 --> 01:16:40,270
It'll drive you crazy when it rains for
seven weeks in a row and you look out

1369
01:16:40,271 --> 01:16:42,160
the window, you're like, I
gotta get the Fuck Outta here.

1370
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:43,660
Isn't not enough online dating.

1371
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:53,290
Be sitting in there
swiping left, right? Nah,

1372
01:16:53,550 --> 01:16:56,810
it's just vitamin D man. It just say
it really is not good for your health.

1373
01:16:56,830 --> 01:17:00,090
San Diego, San Diego. Love it.
Well, I love Sandy. I live in a,

1374
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:04,150
a nice apartment complex now and the
good thing about it is I can transfer,

1375
01:17:04,570 --> 01:17:08,170
they have a relocation program. Like
if you want to transfer 30 miles away,

1376
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:10,070
that you can do it for free. So I can

1377
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:14,950
choose those cities. Oh. So like I
can just transfer it to them cities.

1378
01:17:14,990 --> 01:17:18,170
I'm thinking like, man, I got to get
out of downtown La. Man, that's crazy.

1379
01:17:18,171 --> 01:17:22,010
Girls rose, it's not a real downtown.
Sounded like downtown New York.

1380
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:26,060
It's like the walking dead
around. Yes. Ah Bro. Listen,

1381
01:17:26,061 --> 01:17:27,650
I live there all the time. It's gross.

1382
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:32,860
I went in there the other day and I was
going to get like some quest bars and I

1383
01:17:32,870 --> 01:17:37,310
seen like this dude in the aisle like
and he, and he was like, what's up man?

1384
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:41,300
And he had like a basket full of
stuff and then I look at him again.

1385
01:17:41,301 --> 01:17:45,010
He just like open enough stuff eating
it. Like you go to another aisle,

1386
01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:48,320
somebody just roaming with a cart and
these is all homeless people just putting

1387
01:17:48,321 --> 01:17:51,650
stuff in carts and this didn't
get kicked out by security.

1388
01:17:51,830 --> 01:17:54,190
And then you see them in check out
and you're like, this is crazy.

1389
01:17:54,190 --> 01:17:58,310
It's every day downtown is insane.
It's infested with homeless people.

1390
01:17:59,190 --> 01:18:03,230
You can't fix it. Like the only way to
fix it is bad. You'd have to take them,

1391
01:18:03,260 --> 01:18:06,800
arrest them, put them in a plane and
fly them somewhere and drop them off.

1392
01:18:06,801 --> 01:18:10,250
But that's what I heard they
doing. I heard they did that to la,

1393
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:12,620
like dropping people off in the
late. Didn't we go over this?

1394
01:18:12,621 --> 01:18:15,630
We went up and someone got
sent to like Indiana. What?

1395
01:18:16,490 --> 01:18:20,480
We looked this up and in fact
they'd been doing that forever.

1396
01:18:20,570 --> 01:18:22,220
Sending people all around the country.

1397
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:25,370
This whole flight paths of what
they did with homeless people.

1398
01:18:25,550 --> 01:18:28,130
They just send homeless people and
let someone else deal with it. Shit.

1399
01:18:28,131 --> 01:18:32,000
They need to drop them off in Denver.
It's hurting our Denver getting bad too.

1400
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:34,130
Of course it's getting
bad with that weed money.

1401
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:38,420
The weed money and now mushroom money
cause now Denver decriminalized mushrooms.

1402
01:18:38,540 --> 01:18:42,920
Prostitution next. Whoo.
Probably cheaper than dating djs.

1403
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,670
Hey man, La boys tough. I don't, I don't,

1404
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:49,580
I'll probably just spend a lot
of money on first dates. Yeah,

1405
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:53,840
I'm sure you want to repress realistic
cause it sucks to be a man and dating

1406
01:18:54,380 --> 01:18:57,650
because you got to impress. Well, if
I remember the precedents, listen,

1407
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:02,450
when before I started making money and
having money dating was fun cause you was

1408
01:19:02,451 --> 01:19:05,880
broke and you can do smoothie dates and
Starbucks dates and then you know he was

1409
01:19:05,970 --> 01:19:09,390
going to spend five, six bucks. I
have a conversation. I'm 37 yeah,

1410
01:19:09,610 --> 01:19:11,170
that's you're too close
to 40 to be doing that.

1411
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:12,200
I know you can't do that no more.

1412
01:19:12,201 --> 01:19:15,890
You gotta you gotta take chicks to palm
springs for the weekend or things like

1413
01:19:15,891 --> 01:19:19,160
that. Well they want to knock me
and stuff now though. Sure. Yeah.

1414
01:19:19,190 --> 01:19:21,770
Like this guy could take them to
a nice dinner. Yeah, I'm nice.

1415
01:19:21,771 --> 01:19:26,690
I don't fault any woman that wants a
man that has his shit together. Yeah.

1416
01:19:26,870 --> 01:19:29,420
Because for so long I didn't and now I do.

1417
01:19:29,450 --> 01:19:32,780
Now I want to have some fun of
course. Yeah. For, forget that.

1418
01:19:32,781 --> 01:19:37,010
I ain't trying to complain no more.
But as far as like cities of the Vibe,

1419
01:19:37,070 --> 01:19:39,860
I love the vibe of San Diego
and I loved the vibe of Denver.

1420
01:19:39,890 --> 01:19:41,170
I love those cities. Yeah. I'm,

1421
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:45,110
I'm leaning towards back to San Diego
because it's still close to like,

1422
01:19:45,111 --> 01:19:46,760
I just drove the Irvine
other day. I was like,

1423
01:19:46,761 --> 01:19:49,930
that was a simple drive as long
as you do it earlier. Yeah.

1424
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:51,800
He tried to do that shit at
four o'clock in the afternoon.

1425
01:19:51,801 --> 01:19:54,680
You want to shoot yourself? You
want to, there's the Irvine Improv.

1426
01:19:54,681 --> 01:19:57,350
I workout all the time, dude.
When I have a seven o'clock show,

1427
01:19:57,351 --> 01:20:00,320
I leave here at fucking noon
and whatnot. Not playing games.

1428
01:20:00,530 --> 01:20:04,580
I leave here at noon. I get there
early. I check in, I have dinner.

1429
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:08,190
I don't fuck around with
that 4:00 PM traffic. It's

1430
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:12,270
insane. It took me six hours
to get down there once.

1431
01:20:12,660 --> 01:20:17,400
When you went to shop show, when he
had his special, how early do no known.

1432
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:22,080
Known Damn. Got a hotel just
to put my shit in. Checked in,

1433
01:20:22,110 --> 01:20:23,910
checked out. I didn't even stay there.

1434
01:20:23,940 --> 01:20:26,970
My daughter had an event the next
day that I had to go to for school,

1435
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:29,160
so I drove back. I said, yeah,

1436
01:20:29,161 --> 01:20:34,080
I drove that back that night after the
show, after the second show, I say easy.

1437
01:20:34,081 --> 01:20:37,320
That's an easy drop though. I remember
some bad. Yeah. Especially late,

1438
01:20:37,380 --> 01:20:40,020
late at night. Yeah. You get a couple
of red bulls and you have your phone.

1439
01:20:40,021 --> 01:20:43,230
Yeah, I got to La quick once a
from when I lived in San Diego,

1440
01:20:43,231 --> 01:20:46,830
I used my boys truck. I met this girl
online in the middle of the night.

1441
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:51,560
It does draw a girl online in
the middle of that, listen,

1442
01:20:52,610 --> 01:20:56,060
I know if I ever was going to
end up on a Joe Rogan podcast,

1443
01:20:56,061 --> 01:20:59,270
I thought it was going to be for me
writing a book about an online dating,

1444
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:04,050
real professions of an online
data. I swear I do that. My Ex,

1445
01:21:04,060 --> 01:21:06,110
you don't need a book, but
just do a video about it.

1446
01:21:06,350 --> 01:21:09,560
Do documentaries about how crazy that
I used to film girls and interview them

1447
01:21:09,561 --> 01:21:13,310
and everything about dating. Like what
sucks about dating and things like that.

1448
01:21:13,390 --> 01:21:17,660
I'm lying. Dating is only
existed for like, like at its

1449
01:21:19,190 --> 01:21:23,210
raw form 20 years. Right.
Ross forum was 20 years ago.

1450
01:21:23,211 --> 01:21:27,330
That was like AOL. That was you
as a Weirdo then though. Oh Wow.

1451
01:21:27,380 --> 01:21:28,213
Everybody listen

1452
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:30,600
if you, if you do Tinder or bumble in La,

1453
01:21:30,601 --> 01:21:35,420
you see and celebrities and everything
on it. I'm ready. Yes. Chicks like Ollie,

1454
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:40,080
successful chicks surgeon for
love. Wow, that's scary. Justin,

1455
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:43,830
why is it scary? Because you don't
know who you really meet him. Like

1456
01:21:43,970 --> 01:21:46,790
for a woman, imagine being a
woman and you're gay. I was,

1457
01:21:46,820 --> 01:21:48,980
it was sucked to be a woman
and trying to be weird.

1458
01:21:48,981 --> 01:21:51,770
A successful celebrity
woman trying to meet dudes.

1459
01:21:52,330 --> 01:21:54,670
You want to hear this
story and this is crazy.

1460
01:21:54,940 --> 01:21:59,260
So I met this famous online female
trainer, beautiful here in La.

1461
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:01,240
She's very pop lang. I'll say her name.

1462
01:22:03,130 --> 01:22:08,130
I met her on match.com and
I got her Instagram and she,

1463
01:22:08,260 --> 01:22:11,890
we, you know, we exchanged our Instagrams
or whatever. So I re I looked at it,

1464
01:22:11,950 --> 01:22:15,130
looked at her, are her Instagram
and she was doing like, you know,

1465
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,050
content but own her phone,

1466
01:22:17,230 --> 01:22:20,830
like in our living room doing like
squat jumps and things like that.

1467
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:24,910
And I reached out to her like we set
up a date, we going to go hike him,

1468
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:29,780
run and do everything. And I was like,
listen, I looked at your, your, your,

1469
01:22:30,010 --> 01:22:31,810
your Instagram page and your content.

1470
01:22:31,811 --> 01:22:34,660
I would love to be able to help you
out and give you better content.

1471
01:22:34,900 --> 01:22:39,430
She lost it. I don't need your
help. I don't need your help.

1472
01:22:39,790 --> 01:22:42,460
You look like you need to
help yourself. Like I'm like,

1473
01:22:42,461 --> 01:22:47,210
I'm just telling you that I could help.
I'm like, why? Like I am a filmmaker.

1474
01:22:47,290 --> 01:22:51,670
I could help you do some content.
Like she, she took it the wrong way.

1475
01:22:51,671 --> 01:22:55,210
Like I probably tried to take advantage
of her millions of followers and things

1476
01:22:55,211 --> 01:22:57,460
like that. I was just
like, boy, I was like, man,

1477
01:22:57,490 --> 01:22:58,780
I'm going to be single forever.

1478
01:23:01,030 --> 01:23:02,830
But I think sometimes that's also,

1479
01:23:02,860 --> 01:23:07,180
there's a very limited communicating
with on in a text. Yep.

1480
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:10,750
It's any ticket the wrong way. Yeah. Yeah,
yeah. You got to kind of meet people.

1481
01:23:10,870 --> 01:23:14,350
Like if you, but I bet if you met her
and you said, hey, you know, you're,

1482
01:23:14,351 --> 01:23:16,510
you are, you're beautiful.
You got a gray body.

1483
01:23:16,511 --> 01:23:17,710
These videos are great and everything,

1484
01:23:17,711 --> 01:23:20,020
but I think I could make them even better.

1485
01:23:20,050 --> 01:23:21,700
She still wouldn't take
it the wrong way. Oh,

1486
01:23:21,701 --> 01:23:26,650
she was like in her 40 forties probably
still get set, but she was a female.

1487
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:28,540
You know those Alpha females that you can,

1488
01:23:28,810 --> 01:23:30,850
some girls have been
fucked over so many times.

1489
01:23:30,851 --> 01:23:33,610
They think everyone's gonna fuck them
over. It's like a dog's been beaten.

1490
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:36,260
You ever pick up a dog
from the pound? Oh yeah.

1491
01:23:36,810 --> 01:23:39,490
I've had dogs in the past and you're
like, Hey, I love dogs. Come on,

1492
01:23:39,491 --> 01:23:42,450
I'm not going to beat you.
This is nuts. So yeah,

1493
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:47,240
I would probably think San Diego
would be to move. Or Denver.

1494
01:23:47,970 --> 01:23:50,910
I like both of them. Man, I'm going
to go wrong and you can't go wrong.

1495
01:23:51,150 --> 01:23:54,570
Well you can't go wrong MMA wise.
Like San Diego has a alliance.

1496
01:23:54,930 --> 01:23:58,380
You know San Diego has a ton of
Great Jujitsu. Shout out to my man,

1497
01:23:58,710 --> 01:24:02,220
Boogie at 10th planet and
then it's close to here. Yeah,

1498
01:24:02,221 --> 01:24:06,450
it's real close to here. But then Denver's
the fucking Shamberg on a lot of gym.

1499
01:24:06,470 --> 01:24:10,890
Denver also has really good vibe.
I liked the people in Denver a lot.

1500
01:24:10,891 --> 01:24:13,290
I liked the people at San
Diego too. I would it look,

1501
01:24:13,291 --> 01:24:16,050
I'd flip a coin if I had
to move out and no kids.

1502
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:20,220
So I would just click on San
Diego. That's it. Everybody,

1503
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:22,380
that's how I'm going to do.
I would be happy either one,

1504
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:25,860
they said you can't go wrong. And
they're both a good size city.

1505
01:24:25,890 --> 01:24:27,900
You know what I'm saying?
Like not too crazy. Yeah.

1506
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:32,260
Like San Diego is a great size. Cities
kind of going out got like, I'm not,

1507
01:24:32,610 --> 01:24:36,420
I don't do clubs. You know,
I'll go to a bar here and there.

1508
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:40,500
Cutting your online dating right.
Gets in the way. Well, I don't know.

1509
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:44,680
I think in the early days I was
in the clubs every day. Yeah.

1510
01:24:44,710 --> 01:24:49,180
That's a waste of time. It's, yeah. A
lot of years I wasted just partying,

1511
01:24:49,181 --> 01:24:50,500
not trying to get my shit together.

1512
01:24:50,590 --> 01:24:54,820
So I feel like now when
it's different, when you,

1513
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:57,440
you find a passionate man and
you get obsessed with it. Yeah.

1514
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:02,290
And I'm obsessed with this anatomy of
a fighter thing. Like I have a, um,

1515
01:25:02,890 --> 01:25:05,590
a post in my phone that I was
going to show you where it was. Uh,

1516
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:08,950
it was like August 22nd,

1517
01:25:08,950 --> 01:25:13,950
2017 and I had four 54 subscribers and
I was like 46 till my first hundred.

1518
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:19,720
And I was like, listen, it's not a lot,
but I appreciate all the supporters, uh,

1519
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:20,381
that I have.

1520
01:25:20,381 --> 01:25:24,130
So this is going to be one of the biggest
MMA documentary channels in the world.

1521
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:27,970
And that was August 22nd, 2017
when I first started the channel,

1522
01:25:27,971 --> 01:25:30,940
I couldn't even name it
anatomy of a fighter yet you
have to wait till you get a

1523
01:25:30,940 --> 01:25:31,773
hundred subscribers.

1524
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:36,380
So like looking back on that
journey in a sacrifice that I,

1525
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:41,050
I've made to like I went from south
Florida to Vegas, Vegas to Florida,

1526
01:25:41,230 --> 01:25:45,520
Florida to Vegas, Vegas to Florida,
Florida to here and now here we are.

1527
01:25:45,790 --> 01:25:47,290
How many subscribers you have now?

1528
01:25:47,890 --> 01:25:52,300
How many dog got Jimmy a I
think to 238,000. Beautiful.

1529
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:55,840
I have a little thing in the
back from when we had a thought,

1530
01:25:55,841 --> 01:25:59,400
100,000 subscribers. We got a
little award. Yeah, I got one too.

1531
01:25:59,490 --> 01:26:03,280
I was like silver creator, 1000
a hundred thousand subscribers.

1532
01:26:03,281 --> 01:26:04,070
I was my only goal

1533
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:08,390
with anatomy of fighter. I have a,
my, my friends have youtube channels.

1534
01:26:09,470 --> 01:26:12,290
Uh, and I seen what they was
doing and that was a goal,

1535
01:26:12,291 --> 01:26:16,700
like the silver creator award. If
you get 100,000. And I was like,

1536
01:26:16,850 --> 01:26:20,150
maybe I get it in two or three
years. That's what I thought like,

1537
01:26:20,330 --> 01:26:23,090
and I can just do this on
the side. And then once,

1538
01:26:23,091 --> 01:26:24,560
once I started getting
some traction, I was like,

1539
01:26:24,561 --> 01:26:28,610
let me ease back on weddings and that
I'm leaving guaranteed income and

1540
01:26:28,611 --> 01:26:33,110
comfortability that put my time and
effort into this because now I'm like,

1541
01:26:33,350 --> 01:26:36,470
I can't, I got 200,000 people
following me. I can't go back now.

1542
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:39,170
I've got to continue to
build this. Well, it's to be

1543
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:41,720
giant man. You really
talented and it's really shit.

1544
01:26:41,721 --> 01:26:44,270
And what I like about this podcast,

1545
01:26:44,271 --> 01:26:46,730
what I was hoping this podcast was
going to be is exactly what it was.

1546
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:49,730
I love to hear people's
stories. I love to hear.

1547
01:26:49,770 --> 01:26:53,090
That's one of the reasons why I like
documentaries because I think we can all

1548
01:26:53,091 --> 01:26:58,091
relate to moments in our lives where
we're lost or we just didn't have it or it

1549
01:26:58,411 --> 01:27:00,880
wasn't we, you know,
it was a halt, wasn't,

1550
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:04,370
it wasn't where we wanted it to be and
trying to figure out how the fuck do I

1551
01:27:04,371 --> 01:27:07,800
get it together? How the fuck do I
make it happen? It's the real, yeah.

1552
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:12,740
It's like Instagram is fake. Like
you make it look whatever you want,

1553
01:27:12,741 --> 01:27:14,870
but documentaries won't lie. Exactly.

1554
01:27:14,871 --> 01:27:16,970
And that's the reason why
I love doing that, that,

1555
01:27:17,030 --> 01:27:20,560
that form of content because
it's just like everybody, listen,

1556
01:27:20,570 --> 01:27:24,770
one thing I've learned about the whole
series is that everybody's not gonna like

1557
01:27:25,370 --> 01:27:28,940
a certain fighter. One fighter
is not gonna get a lot of views,

1558
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:30,440
a some people,

1559
01:27:30,441 --> 01:27:32,810
and not even going to care about that
fighter because that's just the way

1560
01:27:32,811 --> 01:27:37,400
momentum in popularity is. But I,
that's what I love it the most.

1561
01:27:37,580 --> 01:27:40,940
Like somebody asked me the other day
because I had posted a picture on my

1562
01:27:40,941 --> 01:27:43,430
Instagram of the NBA draft.

1563
01:27:43,431 --> 01:27:47,180
It was one player sitting by herself while
they was interviewing Zion Williamson

1564
01:27:47,180 --> 01:27:50,240
, all the media. And you know
how it is immediately in the UFC,

1565
01:27:50,241 --> 01:27:54,170
everybody got their name or this guy
was sitting by herself and nobody was

1566
01:27:54,171 --> 01:27:58,250
trying to talk to them. And I said,
Yo, if you ever in this position,

1567
01:27:58,251 --> 01:28:01,250
use this as motivation. And I
think like C'mon Guzman posted,

1568
01:28:01,251 --> 01:28:03,470
like I've been there where nobody
wants to pay attention to you.

1569
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:05,240
So somebody comment and was like,

1570
01:28:05,900 --> 01:28:09,710
would you rather film Khabib or
a regional LFA guy? I was like,

1571
01:28:09,711 --> 01:28:10,850
the regional LFA Guy,

1572
01:28:10,970 --> 01:28:15,230
I take pleasure in the connecting with
people just like me. I'm not popular.

1573
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:18,710
It was that picture right there. Like
nobody's paying attention to them.

1574
01:28:19,010 --> 01:28:23,260
And that's how I just clicked.
No thanks to the pop up ad.

1575
01:28:23,690 --> 01:28:27,680
That's essentially what they're
saying about him. No thing. So that's,

1576
01:28:27,710 --> 01:28:31,870
that's how I feel even in the media
circuit with what I do is with

1577
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:34,000
everything. Yeah. I mean I've
been there as a comedian,

1578
01:28:34,180 --> 01:28:38,020
I've been there in the early
days of podcasting. You
know, it's, it's how it is.

1579
01:28:38,510 --> 01:28:40,420
It's just life is a journey.

1580
01:28:40,450 --> 01:28:45,450
And what I love about your story is that
people can relate to someone struggling

1581
01:28:45,941 --> 01:28:48,520
and then figuring it out and then
it gives them hope. Like, okay,

1582
01:28:48,521 --> 01:28:49,420
I'm struggling now,

1583
01:28:49,421 --> 01:28:52,900
but if I just make the right moves and
put the right amount of effort and focus

1584
01:28:52,901 --> 01:28:57,070
and dedication to something, I can
make something happen. Everybody can.

1585
01:28:57,130 --> 01:29:00,640
I've really believed that and I love
that. It's one of my favorite things.

1586
01:29:00,670 --> 01:29:02,070
I'm a, I'm a success

1587
01:29:02,580 --> 01:29:04,800
junkie. I love watching
other people's success.

1588
01:29:04,980 --> 01:29:08,620
I'm a big fan of other
[inaudible] well yeah,

1589
01:29:09,380 --> 01:29:13,440
it's helping people. Yeah. Listen, um,

1590
01:29:14,130 --> 01:29:16,620
I've been in locker rooms when they
lose and I'm in there when they,

1591
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:21,560
they win and it's the same for me. I
feel bad for the other opponent. Like I,

1592
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:22,470
people always ask me,

1593
01:29:22,471 --> 01:29:26,760
do you get any type of excitement out
of filming guys when or not really?

1594
01:29:27,150 --> 01:29:31,320
I'm just telling the story. You have
to be like that. Like Colby Covington,

1595
01:29:31,620 --> 01:29:32,220
C'mon ooze mine.

1596
01:29:32,220 --> 01:29:36,020
I would love to be neutral and film both
of them and do a story on Colby in a

1597
01:29:36,030 --> 01:29:38,850
story on Uzma. Like people
always get mad was like,

1598
01:29:38,851 --> 01:29:43,200
why don't you post about this fight? I'm
like, I'm finding this myself. I'm not,

1599
01:29:43,201 --> 01:29:47,970
I can't, first of all, again,
stop rules, fucking comments.

1600
01:29:48,610 --> 01:29:50,810
They'll change perception. So I've,

1601
01:29:50,811 --> 01:29:54,780
I've met people that have gotten
mad reading comments, they go crazy.

1602
01:29:55,170 --> 01:29:56,880
They think the world's out
to get them. I'm like, Hey,

1603
01:29:56,881 --> 01:30:01,560
you got like a hundred people that are
talking shit to you and then you've got a

1604
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:03,810
thousand million or whatever the fuck
it is. They love, they love you. Don't,

1605
01:30:03,811 --> 01:30:08,100
don't do this man, don't do that.
But I, but I do wish I, I get,

1606
01:30:08,130 --> 01:30:12,570
I can't wait till I get to a point where
I can have the resources to go film a

1607
01:30:12,571 --> 01:30:15,720
lot more content because
I love doing this.

1608
01:30:16,170 --> 01:30:20,100
Like I would love to go to when you
had colonial Roundtree on and I had

1609
01:30:20,101 --> 01:30:22,020
commented on it on a comment on Youtube,

1610
01:30:22,021 --> 01:30:25,890
like I would love to do anatomy of
Kahlil and Thailand. I'll hook it up.

1611
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:29,580
I would love to just go there to Thailand.
I couldn't, you know, collegial. Nah,

1612
01:30:29,581 --> 01:30:30,900
I never met him. He's amazing.

1613
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:34,440
Just go out when I send you on the edge
in no damn buildings like he was doing.

1614
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:36,600
He crazy for that. He's crazy. But the,

1615
01:30:36,601 --> 01:30:40,320
the transformation that guy's made as a
fighter from when he went to Thailand,

1616
01:30:40,321 --> 01:30:44,400
he's back there now. He's in Bangkok.
He's a beast man. That Eric Anders fight.

1617
01:30:44,401 --> 01:30:48,960
I was like, Holy Shit. And Aaron, he's
a tough dude. He's as tough as that.

1618
01:30:48,970 --> 01:30:52,020
He did. That was one thing Kahleel
said he never even winced. I mean,

1619
01:30:52,021 --> 01:30:56,730
he is eating leg kick after leg kick
from a guy who kicks as hard as anybody

1620
01:30:56,731 --> 01:31:00,330
I've ever seen. That's
crazy. Khalila is so fast.

1621
01:31:00,810 --> 01:31:04,560
When I was watching him throw those
kicks, I was like, well, who is this guy?

1622
01:31:04,620 --> 01:31:07,200
He was weird. How did
you turn into this guy?

1623
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:12,090
Like you see as earlier fights and you
see this, he beat go guns go, wasn't it?

1624
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:16,680
He not go concentrating loss, right?
Yeah. He lost the Johnny Johnny Walker.

1625
01:31:16,710 --> 01:31:19,200
Johnny when he went and
reinvented itself again,

1626
01:31:19,260 --> 01:31:21,060
Johnny caught him with an
elbow in the clinch man.

1627
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:25,020
He caught him with one of these of these
elbows in the clinch and he kao them

1628
01:31:25,290 --> 01:31:27,390
and you know, he would just said, okay,

1629
01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:30,800
I have to really learn Moitai and
so fucking I'm going to Thailand.

1630
01:31:30,810 --> 01:31:35,340
I know he went to Thailand and I
followed his Instagram journey, you know,

1631
01:31:35,380 --> 01:31:38,490
watching all his training footage and
that and he just fell in love with

1632
01:31:38,491 --> 01:31:40,530
Thailand. And then he
came back and I'm like,

1633
01:31:40,710 --> 01:31:43,950
this is motherfuckers fight like a
tonight looking like Saget from street

1634
01:31:43,951 --> 01:31:48,951
fighter but like a jacked
muscular 205 tie too crazy.

1635
01:31:49,260 --> 01:31:53,340
That's crazy man. The nicest guy.
Yeah, he couldn't get a nicer guy.

1636
01:31:54,410 --> 01:31:56,760
It's nuts to to see that transformation.

1637
01:31:56,761 --> 01:32:00,060
Like to see him go from like
this guy that was chubby

1638
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:02,320
and then this world class fighter.

1639
01:32:02,390 --> 01:32:06,770
Well does that too. But the
difference between him in,

1640
01:32:06,771 --> 01:32:10,670
well it's hard to say, right because the
goal, Khan Saki fight was real quick.

1641
01:32:10,671 --> 01:32:13,670
He just cracked him in the left
hand and Khalila is very fast.

1642
01:32:14,060 --> 01:32:17,000
And then see him getting Kao by
Johnny Walker. But then to see,

1643
01:32:17,160 --> 01:32:19,430
I've saw his other fights.
I've seen many fights of his,

1644
01:32:19,431 --> 01:32:21,890
but see that the transformation, I'm like,

1645
01:32:21,891 --> 01:32:26,891
what the fuck the kicks man it was the
kicks that he put it all together and he

1646
01:32:27,111 --> 01:32:28,730
was fighting tie style.

1647
01:32:28,850 --> 01:32:33,770
It's like he was one more of the most
representative of Moitai I'd ever seen in

1648
01:32:33,771 --> 01:32:37,220
MMA cause he, he just, he just absorbed

1649
01:32:37,850 --> 01:32:40,360
was, was better that
the Thai style kickboxer

1650
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:44,210
Dutch. There's no better man. The
thing is like, look at Ramon Dekkers.

1651
01:32:44,211 --> 01:32:47,360
Ramon Dekkers went over there and he
fucked everybody up in Thailand and he was

1652
01:32:47,361 --> 01:32:49,460
their size. It's the athlete,

1653
01:32:49,580 --> 01:32:53,840
but it's also how they incorporate
it in, you know, this look,

1654
01:32:53,990 --> 01:32:58,820
there's some great tie fighters.
Like I'm a w who the fuck is,

1655
01:32:58,890 --> 01:33:03,850
I forgot how to say his name. That
just a doom bages knocked him out. Um,

1656
01:33:04,070 --> 01:33:06,570
big time tie fighter, uh,

1657
01:33:06,890 --> 01:33:09,320
be had like 200 pro Thai fights.

1658
01:33:09,650 --> 01:33:13,100
He had so many do make
caught him with a in glory,

1659
01:33:13,101 --> 01:33:14,930
caught them on the right
hand. The clinch k owed him.

1660
01:33:15,260 --> 01:33:19,580
It's like everybody sty and
doom bays. More of a kickboxer.

1661
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:24,620
It's everybody. It's, it's the athlete,
but everybody style has merits.

1662
01:33:24,940 --> 01:33:29,000
Like there's merits to just being that
wrestler who ground in pounds and doesn't

1663
01:33:29,001 --> 01:33:29,840
throw many kicks.

1664
01:33:30,020 --> 01:33:32,660
There's merits to being that Jujitsu
guy that doesn't care that if they get

1665
01:33:32,661 --> 01:33:35,570
taken down, it's just like,
who are you though? Are you,

1666
01:33:35,750 --> 01:33:39,350
are you Damien Maia on the ground?
You know? I mean if you're Damian,

1667
01:33:39,610 --> 01:33:41,870
my on the ground, there's
merits to that style.

1668
01:33:41,930 --> 01:33:46,730
Damien Maia has strangled a whole lot of
world-class killers that never even got

1669
01:33:46,731 --> 01:33:47,690
a punch off on him.

1670
01:33:48,250 --> 01:33:50,280
Uzma I got out of that
wizard, they broke up,

1671
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:55,910
they fucked it in Maya Naba. Lev is the
guy he knocked out in his last fight.

1672
01:33:55,940 --> 01:33:59,300
Doom, Doom Bay's a beast. Well, set
your doom base and interesting guy man,

1673
01:33:59,301 --> 01:34:02,960
because he reinvented himself. He
was more of like a runner, not or,

1674
01:34:02,961 --> 01:34:03,830
I want to say a runner,

1675
01:34:03,831 --> 01:34:07,550
but more of a mover and he would
win on points and he would,

1676
01:34:07,580 --> 01:34:10,790
but then he'd just let the last few
fights. It was a couple fights ago,

1677
01:34:11,300 --> 01:34:14,240
two or three fights ago.
He fought a, I forget,

1678
01:34:14,340 --> 01:34:19,010
I forget how to say the fuck his name
said. I don't remember how to say that.

1679
01:34:19,011 --> 01:34:20,990
His name. Thai guys
have those crazy names.

1680
01:34:21,310 --> 01:34:24,580
I uh, but I want to do this.
I'm Finna do some stuff with uh,

1681
01:34:24,730 --> 01:34:29,560
glory to glory is amazing. Gory does
not get the respect that it deserves.

1682
01:34:29,850 --> 01:34:32,390
No, I'm a giant fan. I
watch all the glory. That's,

1683
01:34:32,510 --> 01:34:35,640
that's what fascinates me
about what I can do. Yeah.

1684
01:34:35,860 --> 01:34:40,070
Cause people just think it's UFC. No.
And Anatomy of a fighters. Everybody,

1685
01:34:40,470 --> 01:34:43,720
anything. It's all of that. So what you're
doing babe, if cops are on that dude,

1686
01:34:43,721 --> 01:34:47,230
he's my favorite. Cedric Doom
Bay. Poof. Yeah. Sox's man.

1687
01:34:47,270 --> 01:34:51,050
He flat lines. Everybody he's
gone to. There it is. Sit.

1688
01:34:51,170 --> 01:34:55,530
Sit Song peanuts. That's it.
Tongue ties sits on penal.

1689
01:34:55,790 --> 01:34:58,910
Say that real quick. Great.
Don't Chas sing songs? Sing them.

1690
01:34:58,940 --> 01:35:03,020
Go but go back to as a, is that
so that guy that he fought,

1691
01:35:03,950 --> 01:35:07,640
Tom Chai, Tom Chai had like,
I mean hundreds of fights.

1692
01:35:07,910 --> 01:35:09,670
I don't know how many
fucking fights yet. Total.

1693
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:13,970
It was more than a hundred type
fights and then a shit ton.

1694
01:35:14,030 --> 01:35:16,220
Look 136 wins

1695
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:22,540
175 fucking fights take 39 losses
if I've won 136 times. Yeah,

1696
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:25,250
he fought 175 times. That is insane.

1697
01:35:25,490 --> 01:35:29,930
So I mean he's got that Todd style. We're
doing base more of a kickboxer style.

1698
01:35:30,050 --> 01:35:31,340
A lot of times people say,

1699
01:35:31,341 --> 01:35:34,520
well they prefer the Thai style because
the elbows and the clinch and the knees,

1700
01:35:34,521 --> 01:35:37,100
but doing bay flatline,
Tim, it's the athlete.

1701
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:42,520
It's the way they incorporate their style
competing against the other style and

1702
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:45,350
there's merits to kickboxing.

1703
01:35:45,650 --> 01:35:49,100
I prefer the Thai style
because I think there's,

1704
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:53,070
there's a real benefit to being really
good at the clench. Yeah. To be in,

1705
01:35:53,140 --> 01:35:57,110
especially when it comes to MMA. Real
good at the clench the knees to the body,

1706
01:35:57,111 --> 01:36:00,890
the elbows in the clinch and kickboxing
does not allow elbows or knees to the

1707
01:36:00,891 --> 01:36:01,251
body.

1708
01:36:01,251 --> 01:36:06,080
But we've seen world-class kickboxers
that have come on like like cro cop.

1709
01:36:06,490 --> 01:36:11,090
You've had tremendous success in MMA
going from kickboxing and to MMA.

1710
01:36:11,220 --> 01:36:13,000
I always wonder where
like somebody like race,

1711
01:36:13,380 --> 01:36:16,410
EFL Nim would do is prime in MMA like,

1712
01:36:17,050 --> 01:36:20,080
well, look at Mark Hunton and mark.
Hans had a tremendous run and Mark Hunt.

1713
01:36:20,110 --> 01:36:24,330
He fought race fri. Yes he did.
Yes, he fought race at fault. Um,

1714
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:28,900
I mean when you go back to
Mark Hunt, Mark Hunt really,

1715
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:32,140
I mean when he won the k one Grand Prix
was probably when he's in his prime as

1716
01:36:32,141 --> 01:36:35,470
an athlete and then he fought
a lot of fights and prides.

1717
01:36:35,471 --> 01:36:38,710
By the time we got him in the UFC, I
mean Mark's in his forties now, right?

1718
01:36:39,100 --> 01:36:43,840
I mean, I think his mark still is he
retiring? It just lost his last fight,

1719
01:36:43,841 --> 01:36:48,670
right? Who We lose to Willis? Um, yes.

1720
01:36:48,790 --> 01:36:53,160
Yes. He lost a wills. Yeah, I think
so. I think he's, he's retired though.

1721
01:36:53,350 --> 01:36:57,690
I don't know, but he's probably close.
You know, I mean, he's had a long, long,

1722
01:36:58,270 --> 01:37:01,200
well, not when I'm, when I was living
in flood. Like my home gym is hard.

1723
01:37:01,201 --> 01:37:04,460
Knock street 65. That's where I started.
That's Henry hooves chip. Right.

1724
01:37:04,530 --> 01:37:08,620
I love that guy. That's like my big
brother, man. Love like a trainer.

1725
01:37:08,670 --> 01:37:13,290
He needs a platform to tell his life
story because it's crazy. Henry Rufus,

1726
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:16,500
he just got back from Thailand. He
went over there, he told me, he's like,

1727
01:37:16,501 --> 01:37:20,220
I just got away from the game for a
couple of weeks and then I came back

1728
01:37:20,221 --> 01:37:23,630
refreshed. Um, cause you know he,

1729
01:37:24,750 --> 01:37:25,710
he's a beast.

1730
01:37:26,160 --> 01:37:29,050
Like I wouldn't want to like get caught
in the alley with Henry Hoof Dog.

1731
01:37:29,190 --> 01:37:33,110
He's a big fellow too. Yeah, he told
us me don't kick your damn knee out.

1732
01:37:33,300 --> 01:37:36,630
Like that's just how it is. I didn't
pissed him off a couple times.

1733
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:38,570
He didn't kick me through the cage. Why?

1734
01:37:38,630 --> 01:37:42,810
I just complaining like
complaining like, Hey man,

1735
01:37:42,811 --> 01:37:47,370
these people didn't pay me enough and
he like quit complaining like fell back.

1736
01:37:47,371 --> 01:37:50,100
I was like, Damn. I was like
holding on to the case. I'm like,

1737
01:37:50,330 --> 01:37:52,540
hoof is a bad man man. You don't
want to get on his bad side.

1738
01:37:52,541 --> 01:37:55,230
He's a great trainer. He isn't.
He a great guy and I'm happy.

1739
01:37:57,290 --> 01:38:00,750
AFS, listen star in his journey.
I've seen so many people say, Oh,

1740
01:38:01,220 --> 01:38:02,011
who've is a great coast,

1741
01:38:02,011 --> 01:38:06,810
but he just can't coach a champion
and just to see him grind in finally.

1742
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:10,500
But he has champions. He has ong and
one fc two double champion. Yeah.

1743
01:38:10,501 --> 01:38:13,170
Michael Chandler done one
to build a couple of times.

1744
01:38:13,171 --> 01:38:17,300
How do you say on this
first name? I'm honest.

1745
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:21,090
I learned in songs how you
pronounce it. I don't know.

1746
01:38:21,630 --> 01:38:23,960
That's why I call him and
he's a beast man. He's a B.

1747
01:38:23,961 --> 01:38:28,140
People are sleeping on one fighters and
I think when you see guys like Eddie

1748
01:38:28,140 --> 01:38:30,990
Alvarez go over there and get KOD and
you see a lot of fighters go over there

1749
01:38:30,991 --> 01:38:33,300
and have real mighty mouse
had a real hard fight. He did.

1750
01:38:33,301 --> 01:38:36,720
That wasn't an easy fight. I love Chautry
too. It's a d. I love Traci as well,

1751
01:38:36,721 --> 01:38:38,940
but it's a different world
where you're not cutting weight.

1752
01:38:39,060 --> 01:38:42,150
It's a different world. You know those
advantages that you have of being big,

1753
01:38:42,151 --> 01:38:45,150
they don't exist anymore. You're now
fighting someone who's your size.

1754
01:38:45,330 --> 01:38:47,850
I think it's better. I'm a gypsy. Hey,

1755
01:38:47,910 --> 01:38:52,910
I would love to go live and seeing the
pool and just in a just film one fc guy,

1756
01:38:53,700 --> 01:38:56,490
maybe cha treat Chautry if you
listen and if he hears this,

1757
01:38:56,491 --> 01:38:59,280
maybe you'd have you come down
and I talked to, I talked to uh,

1758
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:01,050
the executive producer of content.

1759
01:39:01,051 --> 01:39:03,000
They want me to do some
stuff for them though it is,

1760
01:39:03,001 --> 01:39:08,001
it's changing the landscape of MMA because
it is literally larger than the UFC

1761
01:39:08,791 --> 01:39:12,950
worldwide because of Asia. All the
millions of views. 1 million. Oh my God.

1762
01:39:13,140 --> 01:39:14,580
Millions and millions. Every.

1763
01:39:14,581 --> 01:39:17,040
Imagine if I got the Asian market
on anatomy of fight over them,

1764
01:39:17,550 --> 01:39:19,260
subscribing it all my God. And then we'll,

1765
01:39:19,261 --> 01:39:22,140
the good thing is you wouldn't be
able to read the contents comments.

1766
01:39:22,350 --> 01:39:24,300
The comments would be all
in Asian. You'd be like,

1767
01:39:24,301 --> 01:39:27,130
I don't know what Tom was saying.
Great. Thank you. Thank you.

1768
01:39:29,910 --> 01:39:33,650
Don't fucking read them man. It's
tough man. It's the hell it is. It's,

1769
01:39:33,651 --> 01:39:36,870
it draws you in. Yeah. You'll be
healthier and happier. You get it.

1770
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:39,450
They're like, I had got
addicted for a minute.

1771
01:39:39,451 --> 01:39:42,150
Like the Khabib effect and
kind of our effect is real.

1772
01:39:42,420 --> 01:39:45,870
And you post the video and you get
100,000 views within the four hours you'd

1773
01:39:45,871 --> 01:39:49,710
like, it's going to be like this all
the time. Then you post, you know,

1774
01:39:49,711 --> 01:39:52,500
shout out to my God, Desmond Green, uh,

1775
01:39:52,710 --> 01:39:56,480
a video of him and this insightful and
it's talking about some stuff and he'd

1776
01:39:56,481 --> 01:40:01,170
get 5,000 views and it's kind of
like that. It's like a high, right.

1777
01:40:01,171 --> 01:40:03,480
And it's like I got away from it though.
That's the reason why I was like,

1778
01:40:03,481 --> 01:40:06,920
you know what? I started thinking
about a lot of stuff in the past month.

1779
01:40:06,980 --> 01:40:08,640
I was like, man, I just
need to move somewhere.

1780
01:40:09,060 --> 01:40:13,980
Live a normal life and film and I can,
I can go fly somewhere, come back home,

1781
01:40:13,981 --> 01:40:15,480
live in Denver, live in San Diego,

1782
01:40:15,481 --> 01:40:20,250
and just be away from popularity and
materialism. And, and that's the thing.

1783
01:40:20,251 --> 01:40:24,750
It's like, I just want to stick to
building this however long it takes.

1784
01:40:24,980 --> 01:40:27,450
And like I said, if I look back
on your channel on it, I see.

1785
01:40:27,780 --> 01:40:31,080
I can't imagine where this could be in
six years, I imagine, where it could be.

1786
01:40:31,160 --> 01:40:33,330
Yeah, no. And then it can be gigantic.

1787
01:40:33,331 --> 01:40:36,750
Especially when you think about the fact
that you have so many different arts

1788
01:40:36,970 --> 01:40:41,490
and different disciplines to
study more. Thai kickboxing,

1789
01:40:41,491 --> 01:40:44,910
Dutch kickboxing, uh,
boxing, Jujitsu, Jujitsu.

1790
01:40:44,940 --> 01:40:48,270
I mean there's so much you can study in
so much you can watch and so much you

1791
01:40:48,271 --> 01:40:51,220
can learn, but you're going
to train yourself. Kamala,

1792
01:40:51,450 --> 01:40:56,110
who's my told me I should go over to
a undisputed and uh, or unbreakable,

1793
01:40:56,170 --> 01:41:00,480
unbreakable and glazer. Why not? And just
throw some hands. We'll just do some,

1794
01:41:00,570 --> 01:41:02,890
oh no, you're fine. You've built for it.

1795
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:06,630
[inaudible] get that long dusty shirts
man. Make you look good. Pants drunk.

1796
01:41:07,890 --> 01:41:10,880
Well you obviously work out. Yeah.
Yeah, I'll work out every day. Yeah,

1797
01:41:11,130 --> 01:41:14,890
every day. But I kind of, you
know what I, I I did, I did a,

1798
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:18,220
I read a whole thing on runners
high yesterday cause I was like,

1799
01:41:18,221 --> 01:41:22,930
I want to get back into
running for endorphins. Yay.
Yay. How much do you weigh?

1800
01:41:23,050 --> 01:41:24,610
Two 30. Yeah. That's

1801
01:41:24,750 --> 01:41:26,070
the thing about running. Like,

1802
01:41:26,071 --> 01:41:28,500
I really think that a lot of
people overdo it when they're,

1803
01:41:28,890 --> 01:41:30,750
whether larger people in the beginning,

1804
01:41:31,020 --> 01:41:34,010
and I think you really should
make sure you, you get someone

1805
01:41:34,940 --> 01:41:37,270
Mala Day is fine a couple
miles a day. Yeah, sure.

1806
01:41:37,300 --> 01:41:40,360
But make sure you don't run on concrete,
man. Hell Nah. Treadmill. Yeah.

1807
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:43,720
Try not to swim or do, I
haven't since I've been in La,

1808
01:41:44,110 --> 01:41:47,530
but in Florida I swim every
single day, every day for now.

1809
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:49,210
We use one of those
life runner treadmills.

1810
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:52,790
Those ones you self-propel
[inaudible] we have one all yeah,

1811
01:41:52,791 --> 01:41:54,370
they have them at the institute too.

1812
01:41:54,440 --> 01:41:57,560
Yeah. What is it called? Not Rife
runner. I made the wrong word.

1813
01:41:58,370 --> 01:42:02,690
They have them at the institute?
Yeah. Yeah. Air Assault.

1814
01:42:02,720 --> 01:42:05,750
It's like an air assault. The air
assault bike. The same company.

1815
01:42:06,050 --> 01:42:08,360
They make that treadmill. It's the shit,

1816
01:42:08,510 --> 01:42:12,410
it's literally 13 something like
13% harder than regular running.

1817
01:42:12,860 --> 01:42:15,050
So it makes you better at regular running.

1818
01:42:15,710 --> 01:42:20,600
That was called salt air on her
assault air runner. Yup. Okay. Yeah.

1819
01:42:20,710 --> 01:42:22,910
I want to get back into
run into, yeah, I'll, I'll,

1820
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:26,600
I'll show it to you when we get done
here. It's really good because you can,

1821
01:42:26,890 --> 01:42:28,740
you, it's self propelled. You're,

1822
01:42:29,030 --> 01:42:31,310
you're pushing it rather than
keep cause with a treadmill,

1823
01:42:31,311 --> 01:42:33,620
all you're doing is like lifting
your leg up and putting it down.

1824
01:42:34,100 --> 01:42:37,070
You're not really propelling yourself
forward. You know what I'm saying?

1825
01:42:37,370 --> 01:42:39,740
Like the belts moving. But this,

1826
01:42:39,741 --> 01:42:42,680
you have to make the belt move and
so when you're making the belt move,

1827
01:42:42,681 --> 01:42:45,980
you're actually pushing with your
legs and strengthens your legs up.

1828
01:42:45,981 --> 01:42:46,880
I prefer it.

1829
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:47,351
I'd be,

1830
01:42:47,351 --> 01:42:50,860
I'd be afraid to do anything at my age
where I'd be seeing these basketball

1831
01:42:50,861 --> 01:42:54,370
players just tear tyranny, Achilles
by just stepping. I'm thinking like,

1832
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:56,420
yeah man, that's tough. Yeah.

1833
01:42:56,530 --> 01:43:00,910
I wouldn't want to get kicked in my
left knee right now, but I have like I,

1834
01:43:00,911 --> 01:43:04,870
I study things that I film
right? And I'll just be like,

1835
01:43:05,230 --> 01:43:06,063
specially like Henry Hoof,

1836
01:43:06,250 --> 01:43:08,740
I'll look at all this leg kicks when
they teach and leg kicks. I'm like,

1837
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:10,270
if I ever get in a street fight,

1838
01:43:10,390 --> 01:43:12,820
I just need somebody to properly
teach me how to kick in that leg.

1839
01:43:12,821 --> 01:43:14,890
I'm disabling whoever in my face.

1840
01:43:15,640 --> 01:43:17,700
That's the first thing I want
to do is kick you in your leg.

1841
01:43:18,190 --> 01:43:21,190
I'll punch in your face. I'm
athletic enough to beat your ass.

1842
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:25,660
But I'm just saying like the kid, it's
the wrestling that's gonna get you,

1843
01:43:25,661 --> 01:43:27,920
cause most fights end up on the
ground. So you got to know what,

1844
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,970
what to do when you tussling with them.
When you go to Ted's planets tonight,

1845
01:43:31,900 --> 01:43:36,340
just ask them to show you some
shit. Yeah, I'm gonna get any Bravo

1846
01:43:36,730 --> 01:43:40,710
orange choke. What a choke with
long arms. A great for chokes, pat,

1847
01:43:40,780 --> 01:43:43,820
great for chokes and
Darcy's and Armin chokes.

1848
01:43:44,050 --> 01:43:47,620
Cause let's look at John. John my height.
Sure. Like I've been around China.

1849
01:43:47,650 --> 01:43:50,950
I just think like you see John Jones
on TV and then you see them in person.

1850
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:52,040
You're he alone.

1851
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:55,670
Mother fucker. As long as he will
fuck you up the best at using it.

1852
01:43:55,730 --> 01:43:58,450
No one's better at using
distance ever than John. He did.

1853
01:43:58,670 --> 01:44:03,590
Did you ever see the video? He uh,
do you know Dr Bow hightower is yes.

1854
01:44:03,890 --> 01:44:08,150
Like when he let John Kick him?
He did? Yeah, he just left. He,

1855
01:44:08,210 --> 01:44:12,500
I guess he like why he just let them kick
them in and John kicked him in his leg

1856
01:44:12,501 --> 01:44:15,470
and he just buckled. I was just like,
oh my wouldn't let him kick him.

1857
01:44:15,620 --> 01:44:19,040
I think he had uh, reached the
number of subscribers on youtube.

1858
01:44:19,640 --> 01:44:23,610
So for the to be crippled.
Yeah, true. Crazy.

1859
01:44:23,950 --> 01:44:26,480
John is a beast. I met John a few times.

1860
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:31,280
I haven't done that anatomy at
John Jones yet. Um, oh yeah.

1861
01:44:31,340 --> 01:44:35,420
Watch this. It's crazy. He's putting
his weight on to John is crazy.

1862
01:44:36,680 --> 01:44:40,940
Oh boy. He deal to another
doctor too. Oh my God.

1863
01:44:41,150 --> 01:44:43,430
It's crippling doctors and
he bit didn't even hit him.

1864
01:44:43,850 --> 01:44:44,683
Nah,

1865
01:44:44,930 --> 01:44:49,060
but you know how weak that leg can be
if you don't train that and strengthen,

1866
01:44:49,070 --> 01:44:51,080
how do you even strengthen
that part of your leg?

1867
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:55,090
Get used to getting kicked there. You're,
you develop all these weird veins too.

1868
01:44:55,091 --> 01:44:59,190
It's real strange. Here's he, Kevin
Randleman his leg after he fought Pedro,

1869
01:44:59,640 --> 01:45:01,800
him around him. Him with the hair he had.

1870
01:45:01,830 --> 01:45:03,250
Didn't he have his hair
blonde or something?

1871
01:45:03,350 --> 01:45:06,740
Sometimes some fights. He had crazy
blonde hair, but he had big legs.

1872
01:45:06,790 --> 01:45:08,180
I was jacked Super Jack,

1873
01:45:08,181 --> 01:45:12,380
but he fought Pedro [inaudible] and Pedro
his own fucked his legs up so badly.

1874
01:45:12,381 --> 01:45:15,290
These giant like veins, like weird,

1875
01:45:15,470 --> 01:45:18,920
like broken veins all over his
leg. Randy couture had them too.

1876
01:45:19,700 --> 01:45:24,110
Also from patriotism. I like Randy all
the years I've seen people kick legs.

1877
01:45:25,070 --> 01:45:25,903
Randy Prob, I mean Pedro,

1878
01:45:26,020 --> 01:45:27,830
his are probably kicked harder
than anybody I've ever seen.

1879
01:45:28,130 --> 01:45:31,850
I remember I watched him at Beverly Hills
Jujitsu in the 1990s he was kicking a

1880
01:45:31,851 --> 01:45:35,330
heavy bag and I was just
like, what in the fuck?

1881
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:40,720
His leg kicks were preposterous just
cause it would just bend that fucking bag

1882
01:45:42,111 --> 01:45:44,150
in half and you just think about
what it would do to your leg.

1883
01:45:44,490 --> 01:45:47,090
Pedro fucked a lot of people up.

1884
01:45:48,110 --> 01:45:49,720
Pedro Hippo was a fucking
beast back in the day.

1885
01:45:49,870 --> 01:45:53,380
I've seen a lot of people get fucked
up in the gym. I just don't release it.

1886
01:45:53,590 --> 01:45:57,120
Yeah, I got a lot of footage that I
can't ever embarrass people. Right.

1887
01:45:57,430 --> 01:45:58,031
And that's the thing,

1888
01:45:58,031 --> 01:46:01,510
like I appreciate all the fighters
that have let me document,

1889
01:46:01,511 --> 01:46:04,660
they lost because they trusted me with
the intimate parts of their lives.

1890
01:46:04,870 --> 01:46:07,570
Like I'm getting invited
around these guys, kids,

1891
01:46:07,571 --> 01:46:10,240
they wives like you just don't do that.

1892
01:46:10,600 --> 01:46:14,350
So that's the respect level they've
given me to where they trust me that I'm

1893
01:46:14,351 --> 01:46:18,580
doing well with the story. So I
appreciate all to take care of them. Yeah,

1894
01:46:18,581 --> 01:46:19,660
you have to hone it. Listen,

1895
01:46:19,930 --> 01:46:23,740
when I first used to come into the gym
with hoof them at the Black Zillions,

1896
01:46:24,550 --> 01:46:28,040
I remember who it was like, who the
fuck is you? Who are you? Right?

1897
01:46:28,120 --> 01:46:31,360
Like what are you doing here?
Right? Like you have to gain that.

1898
01:46:31,390 --> 01:46:34,600
Like I get so many fans,
like fans be like, Hey,

1899
01:46:34,660 --> 01:46:38,710
do you think I could be with you at
a fight week? And I'm thinking like,

1900
01:46:39,460 --> 01:46:39,971
Nah man,

1901
01:46:39,971 --> 01:46:44,950
you have to build your way to distrust
this is these managers have to trust you.

1902
01:46:45,190 --> 01:46:48,580
Like the gyms have to trust you. These
coaches have to trust you. You know,

1903
01:46:48,581 --> 01:46:52,140
some people you real picky about
what you film and you know,

1904
01:46:52,141 --> 01:46:54,120
maybe it's a one week after the fight,

1905
01:46:54,121 --> 01:46:56,670
they know a lot of people watching
the channel now we can't release.

1906
01:46:57,060 --> 01:47:00,400
That's the how they was with so Hutto
when, so Hudl followed a Marlin,

1907
01:47:00,930 --> 01:47:05,520
I had released a snippet of the episode
I was going to release and it was like

1908
01:47:05,940 --> 01:47:10,590
they was on the opposite sides of the
cage at the gym and it was like fight.

1909
01:47:10,591 --> 01:47:13,380
And then he came out exactly the way
he was going to come out with Marlin,

1910
01:47:13,530 --> 01:47:16,600
but I wasn't paying attention. It was
slow motion. He was just coming out. So,

1911
01:47:16,890 --> 01:47:21,540
so Hutto freaking out fight week. He
like, Bro, did you post this shit?

1912
01:47:21,541 --> 01:47:22,380
I'm like, no. He was like, man,

1913
01:47:22,381 --> 01:47:25,590
you got to take that down because that's
exactly what I'm doing with Marlin.

1914
01:47:25,980 --> 01:47:28,890
And I was like, aw man. Was he
doing that was so unusual. You know,

1915
01:47:28,891 --> 01:47:32,040
like as soon as the fight started, he
was Finna come out in a certain stance.

1916
01:47:32,340 --> 01:47:34,470
He was gonna come out in a certain
stance, like a look, you know,

1917
01:47:34,471 --> 01:47:37,470
his little karate style. And
then he was gonna actually do,

1918
01:47:37,530 --> 01:47:39,810
I don't know what it was, but he
was freaking out and I was just like

1919
01:47:39,960 --> 01:47:40,440
that.

1920
01:47:40,440 --> 01:47:45,310
The thing about Marlin is
Marlin is a giant one 35 yeah,

1921
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:48,180
I mean Marlin is so big. I don't
know how much weight he cuts,

1922
01:47:48,181 --> 01:47:51,780
but I know the California won't let them
fight one 35 again because California

1923
01:47:51,781 --> 01:47:56,550
has that room where you can't hydrate
more than, I think it's 10% or so.

1924
01:47:56,551 --> 01:47:59,430
You can't blow back up.
You can't blow it back up.

1925
01:47:59,431 --> 01:48:03,270
So he did blow back up in a fight in
California, said no more, one 35 few cars.

1926
01:48:03,410 --> 01:48:06,870
So it's very obvious that he's cutting a
tremendous amount of weight. He's huge.

1927
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:09,330
He's huge. So it like a comic
book character. Yeah, he is.

1928
01:48:09,390 --> 01:48:13,710
So I think that he cut way too much weight
and I think that that contributes to

1929
01:48:13,711 --> 01:48:16,830
his demise in the second round
because he couldn't take Henry out.

1930
01:48:17,850 --> 01:48:20,820
Henry was a lot done with the
needs, the knees. I was like,

1931
01:48:20,821 --> 01:48:23,430
it's 10 days in a row. What
was ridiculous? And he didn't.

1932
01:48:23,490 --> 01:48:25,830
He let him clinch with him
like that in a way that you,

1933
01:48:25,860 --> 01:48:30,090
you don't do unless you're tired. And
it just, I think he compromises himself.

1934
01:48:30,120 --> 01:48:31,680
I think there's two things going on. One,

1935
01:48:31,860 --> 01:48:35,280
I think Henry has a force
of will that very few,

1936
01:48:35,281 --> 01:48:38,220
few human beings can ever
possibly understand. I mean,

1937
01:48:38,221 --> 01:48:40,370
Henry has a self belief and,

1938
01:48:40,371 --> 01:48:43,470
and just a stainless steel will,

1939
01:48:43,680 --> 01:48:45,540
that motherfucker just puts it on you.

1940
01:48:46,020 --> 01:48:49,110
And I think Marlin outclass
him in that first round,

1941
01:48:49,111 --> 01:48:50,370
but I don't think it's sustainable.

1942
01:48:50,371 --> 01:48:55,200
I don't think you can keep that pace
with that dehydration level and with what

1943
01:48:55,201 --> 01:48:58,320
he's doing to his body to make
135 pounds. I think he cripples.

1944
01:48:58,380 --> 01:49:01,350
So where does the division go now? Since
Henry goes out, here's the problem.

1945
01:49:01,351 --> 01:49:03,210
If he goes to one 45 right?

1946
01:49:03,210 --> 01:49:06,450
If marlin goes to one 45 then he doesn't
maintain the same advantages that he

1947
01:49:06,451 --> 01:49:11,300
has in cutting all that weight. Then
he's the size of these guys, Leo.

1948
01:49:11,301 --> 01:49:12,740
Okay, so he goes to one 40 foot.

1949
01:49:12,741 --> 01:49:16,650
Just think about guys like Calvin
cater that can flatten Ryan, you know,

1950
01:49:16,680 --> 01:49:21,570
crack flatline you and he's tall and long
and that shit is not going to work on

1951
01:49:21,571 --> 01:49:24,900
him the way it works on those
135 pound guys. It's a different,

1952
01:49:24,930 --> 01:49:26,760
it's a different world.
You got Josie Aldo,

1953
01:49:27,030 --> 01:49:31,410
you know you got Max Holloway
who's walking around at
one 80 and get down to one

1954
01:49:31,411 --> 01:49:35,460
45 and that's his teammate though.
What's as a beat. As a beat. Yeah.

1955
01:49:35,461 --> 01:49:38,130
I'm like my God man. It's a beat
as a mother fucker's a shot.

1956
01:49:38,131 --> 01:49:42,570
That's a Shalane monk. Woo. He's amazing.
They go make a movie Jack Stan Guy.

1957
01:49:42,790 --> 01:49:46,410
They're gonna make a movie of him.
Yeah, he got a crazy store. Yeah.

1958
01:49:46,750 --> 01:49:48,010
Like monk type

1959
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:52,790
stuff. Send them off as a kid
type thing. Yeah, they listen.

1960
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:55,960
Xa beat up. I've never
seen it likes a beat.

1961
01:49:56,080 --> 01:50:00,220
He's filming him and training him. His
English getting better too. It is good.

1962
01:50:00,580 --> 01:50:05,530
That's a good thing for him. Like I
think he is. He's the next, well man,

1963
01:50:05,531 --> 01:50:09,340
there's so many stars.
Bruin and Dagestan. It's,

1964
01:50:09,460 --> 01:50:11,380
there's so many of them
over there. And sure, well,

1965
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:14,290
if they have that mentality
and they're that tough,

1966
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:17,650
I mean there's just that that breeds
more people like that. You know,

1967
01:50:17,651 --> 01:50:22,210
killers breed killers. You look at
like Jim's like Aka, right? You know,

1968
01:50:22,211 --> 01:50:26,830
you've got Cain Velasquez, Daniel
Cormier, age, you know, go down the line.

1969
01:50:27,160 --> 01:50:30,640
You know Luke Rockhold, John
Fitch and Josh Koscheck.

1970
01:50:30,641 --> 01:50:33,820
How many fucking killers have come
out of that gym? You got to see a,

1971
01:50:34,280 --> 01:50:38,920
they could be even and play basketball,
uh, in Dagestan when I was over there.

1972
01:50:39,030 --> 01:50:42,400
It's like one of my most popular videos
where they train, they play basketball,

1973
01:50:42,401 --> 01:50:46,570
full game hours of basketball and then
train for two hours and they no dribbling

1974
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:50,140
but doesn't compete. You have fucked up
knees. What do you mean by no dribbling?

1975
01:50:50,680 --> 01:50:54,610
It's called Dagestan basketball. Just
hold onto it like rugby, basketball.

1976
01:50:54,640 --> 01:50:58,180
Come on, look at this. Look at,
what the fuck am I looking at?

1977
01:50:58,210 --> 01:51:01,840
It's the craziest thing
is hold onto it. No,

1978
01:51:02,500 --> 01:51:04,600
they trying to wrestle.
They throwing you down.

1979
01:51:04,601 --> 01:51:07,540
Like people are getting choked out.
Like it's the craziest thing ever.

1980
01:51:07,541 --> 01:51:12,310
This is the most ridiculous. I
could be so sorry. In basketball.

1981
01:51:12,311 --> 01:51:16,720
JV. Jamie loves. This is the
look, look, JV. This is crazy.

1982
01:51:16,750 --> 01:51:21,190
White Russia basketball audit. Look,
look, it could be what happens.

1983
01:51:23,230 --> 01:51:27,760
It gets intense too. Oh my God. I play
with them once. Why don't they dribble?

1984
01:51:28,030 --> 01:51:32,260
I have no clue. Let's look at his
dad. Look at his dad. Look at his dad.

1985
01:51:32,590 --> 01:51:34,330
He and he intents to yelling at him.

1986
01:51:34,390 --> 01:51:37,100
They probably play with a medicine
ball now they playing with a red.

1987
01:51:37,820 --> 01:51:41,650
You said a medicine ball heavy
as hell. That is so ridiculous.

1988
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:45,580
Watching people run around and play
basketball. Look at him dribbling. Look,

1989
01:51:45,640 --> 01:51:50,020
that is hilarious. Look, it could
be look, be scored. Look, look.

1990
01:51:50,021 --> 01:51:51,250
He looked at me. He pointed it to me.

1991
01:51:51,610 --> 01:51:55,920
He pointed to me like you had have
you traveled? This is not reasonable.

1992
01:51:56,680 --> 01:51:59,320
And they play for hours. That's,
and then they're like, oh,

1993
01:51:59,321 --> 01:52:03,130
it's coming to train. It's time to
train now. So that's their warm up. Yup.

1994
01:52:03,160 --> 01:52:07,360
That's the gym. Could be trains in
Riley. That's it. That right there.

1995
01:52:07,450 --> 01:52:11,010
That's crazy. The fact, look at
these guy. Look, the fact that they,

1996
01:52:11,110 --> 01:52:15,670
they play a different from
version of basketball.

1997
01:52:16,270 --> 01:52:18,680
Did you just get killed?
What happened there? It man,

1998
01:52:18,790 --> 01:52:22,390
this look trip at the end of this could
be even going like choke somebody out

1999
01:52:22,420 --> 01:52:24,460
like it's really, yeah, it's crazy man.

2000
01:52:24,461 --> 01:52:27,370
They they not and they run on
the mats with their shoes on.

2001
01:52:27,550 --> 01:52:30,340
These motherfuckers are going
to get staff look, look, look,

2002
01:52:30,341 --> 01:52:33,940
look where it could be.
What is happening here.

2003
01:52:33,941 --> 01:52:38,400
This is so ridiculous.
Running back playing rugby.

2004
01:52:38,830 --> 01:52:40,750
It's like rugby, basketball.
That's what I called it.

2005
01:52:40,751 --> 01:52:44,230
But they call it a different thing in
Dagestan and I found that they call it,

2006
01:52:44,620 --> 01:52:47,360
it's something, it's like
Australian rules football. Right.

2007
01:52:47,361 --> 01:52:50,720
And like Dagestan goes bad literally.
And I'll play, I'll play with them.

2008
01:52:50,900 --> 01:52:55,780
And my knee was swelled for two days in
Dagestan because they tackled you. Oh,

2009
01:52:55,790 --> 01:52:59,090
they was killing me.
[inaudible] look after,

2010
01:52:59,091 --> 01:53:02,000
after I was trying to dribble
or scoring and everything,

2011
01:53:02,001 --> 01:53:04,640
but when I kept getting my knee
started hurting, it could be,

2012
01:53:04,641 --> 01:53:06,860
it was like brother,
you too big to be sorry.

2013
01:53:09,650 --> 01:53:13,550
I was like, Hey, I can't move in. Is Wrong
with you? Like you twisted your knee.

2014
01:53:13,580 --> 01:53:15,680
Yeah. They all, they was all
arguing about picking me up.

2015
01:53:15,681 --> 01:53:18,790
Cause I remember that when I dumped on
Khabib, I sent you that, that, that,

2016
01:53:18,910 --> 01:53:21,920
that image of me Duncan on can be
like, he's trying to guard me. Yes.

2017
01:53:21,980 --> 01:53:24,560
They really wanted to pick me up.
Then it was like, oh, we getting him.

2018
01:53:24,890 --> 01:53:26,150
So I'm thinking he is going to be easy.

2019
01:53:26,151 --> 01:53:29,600
I'm gonna just hold the ball up and jump
board. They was taking my knees out.

2020
01:53:30,050 --> 01:53:32,750
They was taking it easy on each
other until they saw the black dude.

2021
01:53:34,970 --> 01:53:36,920
When they saw the black dude
play, they was like, oh,

2022
01:53:36,921 --> 01:53:40,400
we really knocked out the guy who
actually had the potential to play

2023
01:53:40,910 --> 01:53:42,890
professionally. Yeah. And they, and
they go on cray. Look, look at this.

2024
01:53:42,920 --> 01:53:47,630
This is hilarious. This serious.
They take you serious to skip ball.

2025
01:53:48,260 --> 01:53:52,350
That's fun. Look at the balls. Look
at it. Every time it hits the ground,

2026
01:53:52,630 --> 01:53:56,090
it's got no bounce. Well
he, he dimed him though.

2027
01:53:56,150 --> 01:53:59,570
Well it looks like the floors are regular
boss stadiums. Look how happy days,

2028
01:53:59,730 --> 01:54:04,550
looking at the debt like that. It is
running with the fucking ball like this.

2029
01:54:04,551 --> 01:54:07,730
It's little and this is slow motion. So
you see, look, push you out of bounds.

2030
01:54:07,731 --> 01:54:09,710
They do all that. They did
that to me a couple times,

2031
01:54:09,711 --> 01:54:13,430
but they run on that fucking beat. Let's
look at this. Look at this. Watch this.

2032
01:54:13,431 --> 01:54:18,160
Look at this. Here it is right
here. Watch this. Look, look,

2033
01:54:18,290 --> 01:54:22,070
look. Could be bang. Stopping.
So he's wrestling with this dude.

2034
01:54:23,150 --> 01:54:24,140
Why is he doing that?

2035
01:54:24,540 --> 01:54:26,900
Because there's the hold them down like
and now the wrestling wrestling look

2036
01:54:26,990 --> 01:54:31,880
could be may stopping and they're
doing it on the mat. Look, look, look,

2037
01:54:32,270 --> 01:54:35,120
babies are mad man. Oh my God, he's
taking his back. He's choking him out.

2038
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:41,030
He never easy in tab. That is crazy. So
they wrestle all their playing points.

2039
01:54:41,031 --> 01:54:45,890
Yes they will tackle you down to there's
no rules. No rules. That is hilarious.

2040
01:54:45,891 --> 01:54:49,510
Look, the guy tapped already
and now he's got him.

2041
01:54:50,390 --> 01:54:55,220
Was I already tapped? Ah Man, he's
bringing back memories. But wait a minute.

2042
01:54:55,480 --> 01:54:56,740
So you look man,

2043
01:54:56,840 --> 01:55:01,460
people trying to get cookie Boffo why
is his teammates cause cause you free up

2044
01:55:01,461 --> 01:55:04,820
another opponent so you can play. But
that it could be, look at the beach.

2045
01:55:05,810 --> 01:55:09,550
He thought his jockey Jay right there.
He got even thought the right there.

2046
01:55:10,760 --> 01:55:14,150
Oh Man. That is crazy. Seeing the
MMA fighters playing basketball,

2047
01:55:14,151 --> 01:55:17,300
that's the worst thing.
This is not basketball and
this is something different.

2048
01:55:18,020 --> 01:55:20,030
I mean, when you're not ever dribbling.

2049
01:55:20,060 --> 01:55:21,810
Did you see the video
of Francis [inaudible]?

2050
01:55:21,980 --> 01:55:25,310
He paid an Amish design Williamson
and then he was out there shooting

2051
01:55:25,311 --> 01:55:29,650
basketballs. ESPN just did it, bro.
For instance, the worst athlete.

2052
01:55:29,780 --> 01:55:32,360
He's not athlete, Bro.
I'm sorry if you can't,

2053
01:55:32,390 --> 01:55:36,500
if you six foot five and can't
dunk a basketball being well,

2054
01:55:36,501 --> 01:55:38,450
don't you remember when
Mike Tyson was in his prime?

2055
01:55:38,620 --> 01:55:41,760
I remember you saying that basketball
with the, with the overall,

2056
01:55:43,420 --> 01:55:46,860
what's his, he's got dedication to one
thing. One thing. Yeah, that's the thing.

2057
01:55:46,861 --> 01:55:50,940
I mean, oh my God. Well, I'll tell
you the little, little, little look.

2058
01:55:53,040 --> 01:55:54,020
He's laughing though.

2059
01:55:54,210 --> 01:55:57,730
That's probably the first time he ever
tried to do that and he will punch you a

2060
01:55:58,200 --> 01:56:02,250
pinkie and your soul will come out
your body. It's so fucking hard.

2061
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:06,230
When he hit Alister, there's another
kickboxer made it big in MMA right now,

2062
01:56:06,440 --> 01:56:09,780
stir over him. But when he, but Alister
was already a real Allister's, very,

2063
01:56:09,781 --> 01:56:14,220
very well rounded. He's not just a
kickboxer, but k one grand Prix champion.

2064
01:56:14,310 --> 01:56:17,610
You've got to call him a kickboxer. But
when he hit Alister with that left hook,

2065
01:56:17,960 --> 01:56:21,420
I was like, Jesus Christ. He
said he saw it the other day.

2066
01:56:21,421 --> 01:56:22,350
They did a free fight.

2067
01:56:22,380 --> 01:56:27,380
They did a free fight on a a UFC channel
and I just watched it over and over and

2068
01:56:28,081 --> 01:56:32,840
over and I was like, Danny was the
follow through punch. Yeah. Oh Jeez.

2069
01:56:32,970 --> 01:56:37,410
That's the scariest, the scariest
moment I ever, I wouldn't say scariest,

2070
01:56:37,411 --> 01:56:39,600
but the most intimidating
moment I ever have.

2071
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:42,240
I was filming Francis eating a
banana and he didn't like it.

2072
01:56:42,820 --> 01:56:45,900
He didn't like you following him. I was
in the elevator with him and ooze mine.

2073
01:56:46,010 --> 01:56:47,700
We was in Pittsburgh when we did USC.

2074
01:56:47,701 --> 01:56:50,170
Pittsburgh when Rocco
fought David Branch back,

2075
01:56:50,490 --> 01:56:53,370
Dan and Francis came
to support come morrow.

2076
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:58,110
So they going to do Jujitsu in a little
workout room and Francis was like

2077
01:56:58,111 --> 01:57:01,190
talking to ooze. My opening and a
banana and [inaudible] and I'm like,

2078
01:57:01,200 --> 01:57:03,960
he put the bit in his mouth. He
stopped eating it and I'm filming.

2079
01:57:03,961 --> 01:57:08,100
He looked a he like slapped the camera
away. That was my boy though. Friends,

2080
01:57:08,130 --> 01:57:10,880
my boy. But that was before
I really, no, no, I'm eating.

2081
01:57:11,320 --> 01:57:15,540
You've maybe just tying in with
bananas in a mouth. They might not like

2082
01:57:17,580 --> 01:57:22,560
the banana in the tailpipe.
That was funny. For instance,

2083
01:57:22,570 --> 01:57:26,040
intimidating man. Oh, he's terrifying.
When he clipped Cain Velasquez,

2084
01:57:26,180 --> 01:57:30,460
here it is. There's that uppercut
uppercut left hook, like a shovel hook.

2085
01:57:30,550 --> 01:57:35,550
Look at this. Boom. Before right
before that, his swagger, how he was,

2086
01:57:35,670 --> 01:57:38,750
he had the confidence bouncing his
shoulders like he was ready to,

2087
01:57:38,820 --> 01:57:41,490
he believed he was the greatest
in the world and then his sleep,

2088
01:57:41,491 --> 01:57:45,210
a fight changed his fucking trajectory,
man. It really did change his life. Huh?

2089
01:57:45,240 --> 01:57:48,270
That's a really interesting fight
because Steve pay was a real champion.

2090
01:57:48,271 --> 01:57:49,104
You know, it's crazy.

2091
01:57:49,310 --> 01:57:53,190
I was in the room next to Francis
in Boston and he didn't go.

2092
01:57:53,250 --> 01:57:58,250
He never went to sleep and I had my door
open like so my room was right next to

2093
01:57:58,921 --> 01:58:02,190
Francis and I had my door
open cause I was like,

2094
01:58:02,280 --> 01:58:06,150
if fighters come by I'm gonna just catch
them with a camera with your door open.

2095
01:58:06,180 --> 01:58:08,370
I kept in the middle of night
editing because that's, you know,

2096
01:58:08,700 --> 01:58:10,800
doing fight week, you know how
embedded releases they series.

2097
01:58:11,160 --> 01:58:14,760
I'm filming all of these fighters and
then I'm going back up to my room and I'm

2098
01:58:14,761 --> 01:58:16,560
editing but I'm already
editing in my head.

2099
01:58:16,561 --> 01:58:19,350
That's how I'm able to get stuff out.
You clean what program you had anyway,

2100
01:58:19,770 --> 01:58:23,310
premiere now premier just doing it.
Just slapping it up as quick as you can.

2101
01:58:23,340 --> 01:58:26,470
But see my method when I film is I'm
already knowing what I'm gonna use. Okay,

2102
01:58:26,480 --> 01:58:29,550
so you making your cuts. I know the
opening shot, I know everything.

2103
01:58:29,660 --> 01:58:31,920
Are you writing all this stuff
down? I'll keep it in my head.

2104
01:58:31,950 --> 01:58:35,280
Just keep it and people will be like, how
can you edit and release it that fast?

2105
01:58:35,281 --> 01:58:37,320
It's like it's already done
before I go to my room.

2106
01:58:37,380 --> 01:58:41,290
I just have to go up there and put
it together. Music, everything.

2107
01:58:41,291 --> 01:58:43,300
I'm able to just, I don't
know how I'm able to do it.

2108
01:58:43,301 --> 01:58:45,330
It's just something natural.
I've been doing four hours.

2109
01:58:45,440 --> 01:58:46,231
See you have a deep passion.

2110
01:58:46,231 --> 01:58:49,690
Yeah I have a deep and I've
developed the skill set to is easy.

2111
01:58:49,691 --> 01:58:53,070
You know they always say oh well you
put in 10,000 hours and something,

2112
01:58:53,071 --> 01:58:53,980
you become an expert.

2113
01:58:54,070 --> 01:58:57,940
I feel like I put in my 10,000 hours
doing all types of different types of

2114
01:58:58,240 --> 01:59:02,200
shoots to to survive.
And now this is my arena.

2115
01:59:02,201 --> 01:59:03,590
This is my big stage. Right.

2116
01:59:03,750 --> 01:59:07,150
But I remember that week France has
never went to sleep. I be like Bro,

2117
01:59:07,151 --> 01:59:08,950
go to sleep. What are you
doing with your door open

2118
01:59:11,530 --> 01:59:13,690
trying to catch you. And
then he would come in,

2119
01:59:13,691 --> 01:59:15,790
sit on a bed and look
at what I was editing.

2120
01:59:16,090 --> 01:59:19,870
Cause obviously I was filming him
as well. And it was just funny,

2121
01:59:19,871 --> 01:59:22,960
like just doze type of memories. That's
like what time was it that he wouldn't,

2122
01:59:22,961 --> 01:59:26,950
he never went to sleep all night. Well,
you know you get there Monday, Tuesdays,

2123
01:59:27,220 --> 01:59:27,671
right? Saturday.

2124
01:59:27,671 --> 01:59:30,900
So it may be Wednesday and you still
up at three in the morning cause you

2125
01:59:30,910 --> 01:59:33,370
fighting late. He know because
think about it, think about it.

2126
01:59:33,371 --> 01:59:38,140
The last fight is what time? 10 o'clock.
Yeah. Nine o'clock. Well La time.

2127
01:59:38,380 --> 01:59:41,860
Boston Times midnight. Yeah.
Midnight. Yeah. So he up,

2128
01:59:42,040 --> 01:59:45,370
cause he can't go to sleep early because
he got a fight and that's one thing I

2129
01:59:45,371 --> 01:59:48,250
discovered about the fight game.
Like Dan, that does make sense.

2130
01:59:48,390 --> 01:59:51,370
You know you fighting at 11:00 PM
yeah. You want to keep yourself,

2131
01:59:51,580 --> 01:59:55,420
you gotta say so he just walking around
the hallways, big ass Francis in Boston.

2132
01:59:56,200 --> 01:59:59,920
It's crazy. It's like looking back
on that stuff and it's like, man,

2133
01:59:59,921 --> 02:00:04,900
I've captured a lot of stuff
already. What's crazy is with him,

2134
02:00:04,930 --> 02:00:08,560
you watch him and then his next fight
against Derek Lewis and neither one of

2135
02:00:08,561 --> 02:00:10,930
them through anything.
Derek had a fucked up back.

2136
02:00:11,270 --> 02:00:14,480
He really pillar like the Polly
Polly and Artem fight. They,

2137
02:00:14,600 --> 02:00:18,040
nobody wants to do anything. I thought
it was terrible. Oh my God, I watched it.

2138
02:00:18,041 --> 02:00:20,980
The fact that Artem beat
him in a boxing match.

2139
02:00:21,010 --> 02:00:24,460
It shouldn't have been even no
contest. But Paulie's never had power.

2140
02:00:24,760 --> 02:00:27,350
He's never been him hands is brittle,
you know what I mean? Hands is brittle,

2141
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:29,760
but he's also, it's never been
a guy that could just stop,

2142
02:00:30,250 --> 02:00:33,640
keep you all kind of really beat the
hell out of him. I firmly believe it now.

2143
02:00:33,700 --> 02:00:36,370
You think so? Yeah. I don't, I
don't like after watching that.

2144
02:00:36,550 --> 02:00:41,020
Well also after watching
Paulie's examination of
that fight afterwards you're

2145
02:00:41,021 --> 02:00:43,960
like, well you thought you lost lost. You
made me thought you wanted a decision.

2146
02:00:43,961 --> 02:00:47,800
You thought you got to shit decision.
Like you didn't do anything. Nah. Connors,

2147
02:00:48,040 --> 02:00:51,490
what'd you think? Kind of gone do whatever
he wants. Probably do a lot of coke.

2148
02:00:52,660 --> 02:00:55,290
You know what's crazy? Before?
I was kidding. Before I ever,

2149
02:00:55,490 --> 02:00:58,710
he's going to have some fun man. I
think if you find a fight that's fun.

2150
02:00:58,711 --> 02:01:01,900
He's got $100 million in the bank.
If he finds a fight, that's fun,

2151
02:01:02,200 --> 02:01:02,981
he's going to do it.

2152
02:01:02,981 --> 02:01:07,510
But the problem with him is eight mean
they wanted him to do cowboy and there

2153
02:01:07,511 --> 02:01:10,700
was some talk about him doing a cowboy
fight but he wanted it to be a main event

2154
02:01:10,780 --> 02:01:14,370
and the UFC wants main events to
all be big time championship fight,

2155
02:01:14,380 --> 02:01:16,810
anything kind of do as big
time. That's what I said.

2156
02:01:17,050 --> 02:01:20,630
But they think that somehow or another
having no championship title online,

2157
02:01:21,190 --> 02:01:25,660
I would love to spend a day in the
life with Dana White. Well Justin Gait,

2158
02:01:25,840 --> 02:01:28,750
I don't think you'd let you do that. You
don't think so? Conflict of interest.

2159
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:30,340
Yeah cause he's got,

2160
02:01:30,460 --> 02:01:33,730
they've got their own thing that the UFC
and best sucks cause I really wanna do

2161
02:01:33,731 --> 02:01:36,970
the anatomy or Dana white just hanging
out with them for a day. Who knows?

2162
02:01:37,110 --> 02:01:40,130
But around with the help
embedded and maybe would help the

2163
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:42,540
Tuesday night contender series.
It would help pump that up. Yeah.

2164
02:01:42,830 --> 02:01:44,660
Air Guy Barris has said
the perfect thing. He said,

2165
02:01:44,750 --> 02:01:46,310
why would the UFC be worried about you?

2166
02:01:46,311 --> 02:01:50,050
You like eliminate stand and
they Coca-Cola. Well I think

2167
02:01:50,090 --> 02:01:52,280
that way but some people don't.

2168
02:01:52,281 --> 02:01:55,010
Some people don't want to
help other things get going,

2169
02:01:55,011 --> 02:01:58,400
but I'm promoting them [inaudible] if
you stop promoting them and just really

2170
02:01:58,720 --> 02:02:01,670
concentrate on a belter and the channels
gigantic now because you did so much

2171
02:02:01,671 --> 02:02:03,860
UFC contest. True. That's
how people look at things.

2172
02:02:03,870 --> 02:02:07,590
Well, you know, my first
idea was to tell the UFC,

2173
02:02:07,920 --> 02:02:10,920
let me just film all the fighters. Y'All
not going to promote this fight week.

2174
02:02:11,160 --> 02:02:14,580
So embedded is 10 other fighters.
Let it anatomy on fire to get them.

2175
02:02:14,790 --> 02:02:18,870
Give me a credential and let me just
filming them all week. So I'm around film.

2176
02:02:18,871 --> 02:02:21,960
These fighters that y'all never gonna
post. What did they say about that?

2177
02:02:22,250 --> 02:02:26,310
Not Interested. Never. Nah, I didn't
get a, not interested, but I don't know.

2178
02:02:26,370 --> 02:02:27,800
It's, it's weird because I,

2179
02:02:27,820 --> 02:02:32,100
I much love to the UFC because they
gave me a lot of access and I love every

2180
02:02:32,101 --> 02:02:36,270
single person over there. Like Dean
Klein and Heidi Dean, all those people,

2181
02:02:36,271 --> 02:02:40,620
I love them. They treat me like a
knowing cousin. They're great people.

2182
02:02:40,830 --> 02:02:43,710
I'm an annoying cousin when I'm
at five and that's the thing.

2183
02:02:43,711 --> 02:02:45,480
I haven't been to a lot of fight weeks,

2184
02:02:45,481 --> 02:02:48,290
but it seems like people think
I go to every fight weekend.

2185
02:02:48,300 --> 02:02:52,290
It's like I only go to ones that
I can afford or they make sense.

2186
02:02:52,380 --> 02:02:55,110
Like if I had the funds, I'd be
at every fight. Week filming.

2187
02:02:55,280 --> 02:02:58,200
Are you going to be in Vegas
for the Jon Jones Taco sauce?

2188
02:02:58,320 --> 02:03:02,070
Yeah, because I'm nominated for award
against you. Oh really? For what?

2189
02:03:02,071 --> 02:03:06,440
The World MMA awards. Best
MMA programming. I what?

2190
02:03:06,810 --> 02:03:11,280
What am world MMA awards that Cari
MMA show. Yep. Now you're on it.

2191
02:03:11,340 --> 02:03:14,730
So I know that's so weird that it's so,

2192
02:03:14,840 --> 02:03:18,000
well I told you confessionalism and online
data was done with the way I thought

2193
02:03:18,001 --> 02:03:18,840
I was going to end up on here.

2194
02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:23,910
Well I hope you win cause I want a
bunch of those. [inaudible] it's me.

2195
02:03:23,911 --> 02:03:26,510
You embed it. Dana Weiss con Tuesday.

2196
02:03:26,700 --> 02:03:30,090
Can Siri continue to
series and then a MMA hour?

2197
02:03:30,340 --> 02:03:34,410
I hope you win against me. How
about that? Had be a, had to be.

2198
02:03:35,390 --> 02:03:39,950
I smoke weed. If I did I'd
be like, I'm done. I'm done.

2199
02:03:39,951 --> 02:03:41,040
I understand you. Your

2200
02:03:41,100 --> 02:03:44,130
reluctance to smoke weed.
I smoked weed maybe five,

2201
02:03:44,131 --> 02:03:47,980
six times until I was 30 years
old, like a handful of times ever.

2202
02:03:48,330 --> 02:03:51,390
Like a couple times in
high school, you know,

2203
02:03:51,410 --> 02:03:54,960
a couple times afterwards at
parties. I get it. I mean I get it.

2204
02:03:54,961 --> 02:03:57,780
The whole personality thing. I
when I, when I was 30 years old,

2205
02:03:57,781 --> 02:03:58,710
that's when I started smoking,

2206
02:03:58,711 --> 02:04:00,960
like really started smoking
weed and I don't think,

2207
02:04:01,710 --> 02:04:03,900
I don't think anybody should do anything.

2208
02:04:03,930 --> 02:04:08,190
If they have an obsessive personality
and they're worried about getting locked

2209
02:04:08,191 --> 02:04:10,140
into it, I mean I don't think
you should drink, I don't think,

2210
02:04:10,230 --> 02:04:12,510
but if you can handle it,

2211
02:04:12,810 --> 02:04:17,810
a little bit of weed I think opens up
these doorways of creativity and I think

2212
02:04:18,421 --> 02:04:22,440
that it's very valuable. Boy told
me, cowboy telling me about mushroom,

2213
02:04:22,441 --> 02:04:25,500
mushrooms, mushrooms as well, I think.

2214
02:04:26,040 --> 02:04:31,040
I think a psychedelic drugs with
their marijuana or mushrooms there.

2215
02:04:31,740 --> 02:04:34,500
They're tools and the way I've always
described it as like you could take a tool

2216
02:04:34,501 --> 02:04:36,090
and you could build a
house with it, right?

2217
02:04:36,091 --> 02:04:39,450
You could take a hammer and you could
build a beautiful deck or you could just

2218
02:04:39,451 --> 02:04:42,180
hit yourself in the Dick if you're
fucking crazy. Sure you could.

2219
02:04:42,181 --> 02:04:45,420
You could abuse a tool, but
it doesn't mean the tools bad.

2220
02:04:45,660 --> 02:04:49,590
It means the application's bad and you
don't give a hammer to a two year old,

2221
02:04:49,710 --> 02:04:52,560
right? You don't give a little kid,
we'd tell them to smoke it every day.

2222
02:04:52,590 --> 02:04:57,590
But I think for a grown adult it's good
to participate in something that gives

2223
02:04:59,101 --> 02:05:01,890
you an altered state of consciousness
because it allows you to look at yourself

2224
02:05:01,891 --> 02:05:02,730
in a fresh way.

2225
02:05:03,090 --> 02:05:08,090
And for someone who's always like trying
to be self assessing and objective and

2226
02:05:08,881 --> 02:05:12,090
always trying to analyze who you are
and your thinking and your behavior,

2227
02:05:12,091 --> 02:05:15,600
I think something like marijuana is very
important because it allows you to see

2228
02:05:15,601 --> 02:05:18,690
yourself in this way that
maybe you don't ordinarily do,

2229
02:05:18,691 --> 02:05:22,980
allows you to drop your blinders and get
a glimpse of how other people see you,

2230
02:05:23,400 --> 02:05:27,120
which is very hard to do. It's very hard
for especially people that you know,

2231
02:05:27,121 --> 02:05:30,330
you put up your barriers, your
defenses, you have an ego.

2232
02:05:30,630 --> 02:05:34,140
It's hard for you to look at yourself
to find the things that you're doing

2233
02:05:34,141 --> 02:05:37,200
wrong. So if you can't find the
things that you're doing wrong,

2234
02:05:37,201 --> 02:05:41,400
it's very difficult to grow. So a lot of
people call that paranoia, that effect,

2235
02:05:41,401 --> 02:05:44,370
that marijuana produces in a small
pot. I don't like smoking pot, man.

2236
02:05:44,371 --> 02:05:48,250
It makes me paranoid. That paranoia I
think is awareness. And I think you,

2237
02:05:48,251 --> 02:05:52,510
you close those doors of awareness in
order to get through your life. But the,

2238
02:05:52,511 --> 02:05:55,170
the subconscious is always
aware of these things.

2239
02:05:55,510 --> 02:05:58,390
The subconscious is always aware of these
things that are fucking with you. Uh,

2240
02:05:58,391 --> 02:06:01,440
marijuana just finds all the problems
and just turns the lights on.

2241
02:06:01,470 --> 02:06:03,900
So if I moved to Denver, I'll
probably end up smoking weed.

2242
02:06:04,260 --> 02:06:06,090
Everybody smoked at all.
If you do it just to,

2243
02:06:06,720 --> 02:06:08,820
what about an edible little edibles kit?

2244
02:06:08,821 --> 02:06:12,090
Careful can't hurt like
a cookie and fuck you up.

2245
02:06:12,210 --> 02:06:16,950
I heard a cookie will destroy you.
I got some quick shot. Rashad Evans,

2246
02:06:17,100 --> 02:06:21,840
that's like my big brother. He always
told me about the toad. Oh, five minutes.

2247
02:06:22,200 --> 02:06:25,740
Oxy dimethyltryptamine yeah. Yeah.
That's that. That'll fuck you up to. Oh,

2248
02:06:25,741 --> 02:06:26,820
he's done that. And I said, yeah,

2249
02:06:26,821 --> 02:06:29,970
you can go into another dimension
or you literally can, I might,

2250
02:06:30,030 --> 02:06:34,260
I might be the president of the United
States and other dimension. Who knows?

2251
02:06:34,710 --> 02:06:38,430
There's no United States and that
other dimension. There's no states,

2252
02:06:38,600 --> 02:06:42,510
there's no people. There's souls
go into like a well of souls.

2253
02:06:42,900 --> 02:06:47,430
That's crazy. Disembodied entities
and told, I remember when I kept it,

2254
02:06:47,460 --> 02:06:48,450
what the Hell is you talking about?

2255
02:06:48,450 --> 02:06:51,150
The toad that told nobody
gets it from a toad though.

2256
02:06:51,151 --> 02:06:52,350
They're really five minutes.

2257
02:06:52,351 --> 02:06:56,520
Oxy done metal trip to me and again from
usually from laboratories synthesize

2258
02:06:56,630 --> 02:07:00,780
with a bunch of precursors. But
the, um, the, the, the other one,

2259
02:07:00,810 --> 02:07:04,800
n n dimethyltryptamine is the one we
see the visuals. It's all really, yeah.

2260
02:07:04,950 --> 02:07:09,030
How long had lessons? 15 minutes.
Unless you eat it. If you eat it,

2261
02:07:09,060 --> 02:07:10,530
what if you did it in the float tank?

2262
02:07:11,100 --> 02:07:14,460
You could do that and you'd have
to do it quick. Like you'd have to,

2263
02:07:14,640 --> 02:07:17,610
have you seen the full tank here? Yeah.
Remember? Oh, that's right there. Yeah.

2264
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:19,230
Um, have you done it yet? Nope.

2265
02:07:19,510 --> 02:07:23,370
You got to you gotta I seen how
extension they was online. How expensive.

2266
02:07:23,730 --> 02:07:27,620
I've seen some, yeah, like the by one
by one. But you could always this a,

2267
02:07:27,880 --> 02:07:29,160
the float lab, they have a,

2268
02:07:29,590 --> 02:07:30,570
it's in Westwood.

2269
02:07:30,571 --> 02:07:34,350
They have a place in Venice and then
there's a giant place that opened up in

2270
02:07:34,351 --> 02:07:36,310
Pasadena that uses all the float labs.

2271
02:07:36,730 --> 02:07:40,400
Was the name of that place again? Yes.
Just float. Just that place has that.

2272
02:07:40,410 --> 02:07:44,650
That is the biggest float,
uh, establishment on earth.
You do it for how long?

2273
02:07:45,160 --> 02:07:49,600
Well, last night I did two hours.
Damn. I like two hours. Yeah.

2274
02:07:50,110 --> 02:07:52,900
I like to just get in there and find,

2275
02:07:52,960 --> 02:07:56,920
find out what the fuck I was when I was
with Cheeto Vera Verda that day when his

2276
02:07:56,921 --> 02:08:00,670
teammates did it for like an
hour and he was just like,

2277
02:08:01,840 --> 02:08:06,500
I didn't, I ain't know where I was. I
sleep in a dream or even just crazy.

2278
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,700
You're disembodied, you know,
Charlemagne trauma and the gun,

2279
02:08:09,790 --> 02:08:13,450
he a was on last week and we were talking
about it because he's doing this whole

2280
02:08:13,600 --> 02:08:16,180
mental wellness retreat sorta center.

2281
02:08:16,181 --> 02:08:21,160
He's like establishing these mental
wellness centers. He is. Yes he is.

2282
02:08:21,430 --> 02:08:25,540
Cause you know Charlemagne is his new
book or shook one is all about his mental

2283
02:08:25,541 --> 02:08:30,400
health. His anxiety is
issues with anxiety and um,

2284
02:08:30,610 --> 02:08:30,880
you know,

2285
02:08:30,880 --> 02:08:35,880
anything that allows you to relax and
just to center yourself can help you with

2286
02:08:36,071 --> 02:08:39,680
anxiety and, and you know, that's one
of the things that he said about the,

2287
02:08:40,180 --> 02:08:44,590
the tank was that he's never felt
stillness like that. That's crazy. Yeah.

2288
02:08:44,860 --> 02:08:47,620
Cause you're not, you're not feeling
your body. You know, your body is just,

2289
02:08:48,100 --> 02:08:52,210
you can do it. You try it out. He had a
crazy life. Yeah. He's had a crazy life.

2290
02:08:52,590 --> 02:08:53,680
Yeah. He had a crazy life.

2291
02:08:53,710 --> 02:08:58,470
And then also like I said to him about
he's the last Samurai in terms of radio.

2292
02:08:58,471 --> 02:09:03,190
Radio is a dying industry. He's the last
guy I think to get famous off of radio.

2293
02:09:03,370 --> 02:09:06,130
Yeah, that's it.
Charlemagne, the God is like,

2294
02:09:06,240 --> 02:09:09,760
I saw a little bit of it and I
remember he said that he was literally,

2295
02:09:09,761 --> 02:09:13,030
he got fired at 31 he was 31
no job with a two year old.

2296
02:09:13,030 --> 02:09:16,360
And that's what people like when stuff
is inspiring because people beat,

2297
02:09:16,570 --> 02:09:18,320
I wasn't unemployed,

2298
02:09:18,820 --> 02:09:23,350
I was like 29 when I was lost and then I
was turning 30 and that's when I got my

2299
02:09:23,351 --> 02:09:24,011
shit together.

2300
02:09:24,011 --> 02:09:29,011
So to hear Charlemagne and God say I
was 31 I had a kid and I was no job.

2301
02:09:29,950 --> 02:09:34,570
Like I think so many people in life are
so obsessed with getting somewhere fast

2302
02:09:34,810 --> 02:09:36,280
and the understand that takes time.

2303
02:09:36,550 --> 02:09:41,550
And just to see somebody like that be
open enough to say like I was at a low

2304
02:09:41,561 --> 02:09:44,680
moment in my life, like at my age now.

2305
02:09:44,710 --> 02:09:48,970
I used to think when I was 25 37
with young or old, old as fuck,

2306
02:09:49,270 --> 02:09:53,580
you're young as hell. You're not old at
37 no more. Yeah, you never been there.

2307
02:09:53,650 --> 02:09:56,980
It's just, we always talk if you're
a healthy 37 when we were kids,

2308
02:09:56,981 --> 02:10:00,100
our parents were attendant at 37
they're working 12 hours a day.

2309
02:10:00,100 --> 02:10:03,670
We felt they felt 50 probably
felt a little, it felt 50 that's,

2310
02:10:03,730 --> 02:10:07,180
I mean thank God to the Internet. I mean,
cause if it wasn't for the Internet,

2311
02:10:07,690 --> 02:10:10,150
I wouldn't be able to put
up these amazing videos.

2312
02:10:10,151 --> 02:10:11,850
I would have to go work
for one of these companies.

2313
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:15,520
It's also the Internet allows you to get
all this information and allows you to

2314
02:10:15,521 --> 02:10:19,000
stay healthy. You get up, you get a better
understanding about diet, nutrition,

2315
02:10:19,001 --> 02:10:23,320
mental health, relaxation, how
important meditation is. You know,

2316
02:10:23,321 --> 02:10:25,900
and I think one of the other things that
Charlemagne did that's very important

2317
02:10:26,020 --> 02:10:30,370
as he talked openly about anxiety
and he's a famous cool guy.

2318
02:10:30,550 --> 02:10:33,800
He's like a famous guy known for
his opinions, known for being Brash,

2319
02:10:34,170 --> 02:10:36,050
for him to say, Hey, I've struggled.

2320
02:10:36,260 --> 02:10:39,980
I've had real mental struggles and
mental health struggles. That's,

2321
02:10:40,060 --> 02:10:43,730
that's a very fragile
conversation in a black community.

2322
02:10:45,170 --> 02:10:49,940
Um, mental, mental health issues
and in anxiety and things like that.

2323
02:10:49,941 --> 02:10:51,620
People don't want to admit it, right.

2324
02:10:51,680 --> 02:10:54,320
Cause when we all but know
even tough it out. Yeah.

2325
02:10:54,321 --> 02:10:57,770
You want to feel brave
and not for me, man. I,

2326
02:10:57,771 --> 02:11:02,690
I felt hopeless and defeat many
times in my life. Sure. Me Too.

2327
02:11:02,750 --> 02:11:07,550
And Luckily for me, sometimes I say, damn,
I don't have kids. Luckily, you know,

2328
02:11:07,910 --> 02:11:09,200
I've been able to, to,

2329
02:11:09,201 --> 02:11:13,070
to figure it out on my own without
having a responsibility to take care of

2330
02:11:13,071 --> 02:11:16,970
somebody. Right. So I've been lucky in
that sense where I haven't, you know,

2331
02:11:16,971 --> 02:11:20,680
had a child, a son or daughter. And
I was like, and that's, it gives,

2332
02:11:20,700 --> 02:11:23,540
that gives me youth, it feels like
every day I wake up, I'm like,

2333
02:11:23,541 --> 02:11:27,280
I can do what I want to do because only
person I'm responsible for is me. Yeah.

2334
02:11:27,590 --> 02:11:31,460
And that gives me the freedom to be a
gypsy. I couldn't be a gypsy if I had it.

2335
02:11:31,550 --> 02:11:34,700
No, nothing like that. You have na
the life button. But you know what,

2336
02:11:34,701 --> 02:11:37,280
if you had a kid, you would just
alter that life and you would have,

2337
02:11:37,470 --> 02:11:41,900
you would take great comfort in the
fact that you love someone deeply like a

2338
02:11:41,901 --> 02:11:45,740
child. It's a, it's a crazy thing.
The love you have for children. Yes.

2339
02:11:45,810 --> 02:11:48,800
It's changes people lives. It
changes. Like I see how you are,

2340
02:11:48,980 --> 02:11:52,490
whose mind went up and he had his
daughter when he's carrying his daughter.

2341
02:11:52,550 --> 02:11:53,630
And that was crazy, man.

2342
02:11:53,850 --> 02:11:57,340
So hard for me not to cry so hard for
me not to cry when people win and they,

2343
02:11:57,550 --> 02:11:59,530
they, they start thanking
their mom or you know,

2344
02:11:59,870 --> 02:12:03,740
the parents hug them or it's like when
he was holding his daughter up, I'm like,

2345
02:12:03,770 --> 02:12:08,660
oh Jesus, here comes back.
That was crazy. Listen man.

2346
02:12:10,670 --> 02:12:11,250
W you know,

2347
02:12:11,250 --> 02:12:15,320
remember when he got in trouble for like
the 30% or people you're going in on

2348
02:12:15,321 --> 02:12:19,120
him cause he was like, I'm
30%. I was 30%. Yeah. Like I,

2349
02:12:19,640 --> 02:12:21,890
the thing that I can say about
being around these fighters,

2350
02:12:22,130 --> 02:12:25,830
I see all the injuries and everything and
then people don't understand what they

2351
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:26,630
do in the fight.

2352
02:12:26,630 --> 02:12:28,910
Well how about the fact that it was
my to that fight with a broken foot?

2353
02:12:28,940 --> 02:12:30,410
I know I seen him crazy.

2354
02:12:30,411 --> 02:12:34,550
I seen that he had a broken foot when he
fought Tyron motherfucking Woodley and

2355
02:12:34,551 --> 02:12:37,060
he never stopped coming.
Never stopped moving forward.

2356
02:12:37,070 --> 02:12:40,340
You would never been able to guess by any
stretch of the imagination that he was

2357
02:12:40,341 --> 02:12:44,120
injured. Yeah, I did. I did. Cause I
filmed it all. You knew it. I knew it.

2358
02:12:44,390 --> 02:12:47,930
I just can't release it. You see
what I'm saying? I'm not going to,

2359
02:12:48,050 --> 02:12:50,390
now after the fight, I can
say, yeah, he was injured,

2360
02:12:50,780 --> 02:12:54,560
but I have that on so many fighters.
So who though? Everybody like, wow,

2361
02:12:54,970 --> 02:12:58,040
who those ankles. I know. How crazy
is that? That was Kudos angle.

2362
02:12:58,041 --> 02:12:59,870
The week of the fight was giant,

2363
02:12:59,900 --> 02:13:04,900
black and blue completely fucked up where
he couldn't walk and then he goes in

2364
02:13:04,941 --> 02:13:06,500
there and fucks up. Marla morale

2365
02:13:09,220 --> 02:13:10,370
could be Conor fight.

2366
02:13:10,371 --> 02:13:13,760
Didn't they say he had like a Conor and
something wrong with his foot too or it

2367
02:13:13,761 --> 02:13:17,600
could be had a problem with his weight
cut? I heard. Did he? I think so.

2368
02:13:17,780 --> 02:13:21,560
It was a bad way. So big. He
other, he's a mountain man.

2369
02:13:21,830 --> 02:13:23,330
What is his diet like?

2370
02:13:26,120 --> 02:13:29,660
It's clean from what I see, but he's
had problems making weight in the past,

2371
02:13:29,690 --> 02:13:33,450
but that was two oh nine think about
that. How long ago that was? Yeah,

2372
02:13:33,630 --> 02:13:37,410
UFC two oh nine yeah. That was the last
time he ever had a problem, but it's,

2373
02:13:37,460 --> 02:13:40,620
you know you had problems before
that though. I didn't know. Yeah,

2374
02:13:40,750 --> 02:13:45,690
I didn't even know. It could be at two
oh nine. Oh um, yeah I that was when, uh,

2375
02:13:45,810 --> 02:13:48,810
the first UFC event I ever went
to. Does he have a nutritionist

2376
02:13:50,430 --> 02:13:54,300
like in, in Dagestan? Does he have, I
don't know cooks for him. I don't know.

2377
02:13:55,050 --> 02:13:58,650
But you eat with them? Yeah, but that
was Robin. Now he's eating all meat,

2378
02:13:58,950 --> 02:14:03,690
meat and potatoes and I sat with everybody
and he does he train during Ramadan?

2379
02:14:03,720 --> 02:14:06,690
Yes he did. That was the whole Dagestan
chronicles. People couldn't believe it.

2380
02:14:06,690 --> 02:14:10,080
He trained, trained too. So he trained
trains during the day without eating,

2381
02:14:10,350 --> 02:14:12,360
without drinking water. Crazy man.

2382
02:14:12,361 --> 02:14:15,780
Why I'm talking about
really hard to like that.

2383
02:14:15,880 --> 02:14:19,110
That's the initial, oh
I want to turn. Yeah.

2384
02:14:19,111 --> 02:14:21,210
I want to turn that whole
series into a movie.

2385
02:14:22,550 --> 02:14:27,250
Understand kind of being able to
work out like fast workouts. Nah,

2386
02:14:27,570 --> 02:14:31,350
fucking no water. Like
training Jesus Christ,

2387
02:14:31,380 --> 02:14:35,430
implant that basketball lightly
with no water. No nothing.

2388
02:14:35,640 --> 02:14:38,700
That is so crazy. That's what I'm, that's
what I'm saying like that mentally,

2389
02:14:38,750 --> 02:14:39,331
that's what I'm saying.

2390
02:14:39,331 --> 02:14:42,690
That mental toughness like and then
when I seen the face off with him and

2391
02:14:42,691 --> 02:14:46,350
Dustin, cause Dustin, I would love to,
to document Dustin cause he's a good guy.

2392
02:14:47,490 --> 02:14:51,780
Um, I thought Dustin was huge when
you just see him with everybody else.

2393
02:14:51,781 --> 02:14:54,030
And then when he did the face I
would, could be, if I'm like damn,

2394
02:14:54,031 --> 02:14:57,240
could be taller than him.
Everything I'm thinking like, man,

2395
02:14:57,500 --> 02:15:00,030
he's gonna have to keep that
guy off him. It could be,

2396
02:15:00,080 --> 02:15:04,620
it was just such a good wrestler.
His said he's going to grab him,

2397
02:15:04,680 --> 02:15:07,370
put him on the ground mount. I'm like
that double dummy and smash them.

2398
02:15:07,740 --> 02:15:09,870
Now I'm out of fire so I can't say it,

2399
02:15:09,930 --> 02:15:13,920
but I kinda feel like that's how I
always call ooze amount of black could be

2400
02:15:14,450 --> 02:15:16,740
because as soon as he grabbed you
to fight over, that's how I feel.

2401
02:15:16,770 --> 02:15:17,850
As soon as he grabbed you,

2402
02:15:18,600 --> 02:15:21,990
it's over cause you're not going to
get away from him anymore. I'm like,

2403
02:15:22,020 --> 02:15:25,350
I'm latched to you. So,
but that Damien Maia fight,

2404
02:15:25,770 --> 02:15:27,170
that referee saved his,

2405
02:15:27,230 --> 02:15:29,880
I know I was in a blocker room like
cussing and never known. You know,

2406
02:15:29,881 --> 02:15:30,700
he would just,

2407
02:15:30,700 --> 02:15:33,390
we don't know what happened cause
the world can change if that referee,

2408
02:15:33,391 --> 02:15:36,500
whoever the fuck he is, I don't even
want to know his name. Last Maya fight.

2409
02:15:36,530 --> 02:15:39,990
He see how he took the back. That's
what he does. Yeah, against the linemen.

2410
02:15:39,991 --> 02:15:43,140
Good. That's what he does to
everybody, man. And that referee,

2411
02:15:43,170 --> 02:15:46,230
that referee separated them.
And I was sick and Matt,

2412
02:15:46,530 --> 02:15:49,740
Sarah went fucking crazy about it
and I was, I was with a tough one.

2413
02:15:49,890 --> 02:15:53,520
But still it's, you don't do
that. I said what you would,

2414
02:15:53,521 --> 02:15:54,450
what would have happened? He said,

2415
02:15:54,451 --> 02:15:57,060
I would have just held it there the
whole time. But you just never know.

2416
02:15:57,210 --> 02:16:00,300
Well if that's how he lost his first
fight, he lost the first five again.

2417
02:16:00,301 --> 02:16:03,720
Choked out. I know, you know, you know
this is something that people don't know.

2418
02:16:04,140 --> 02:16:06,810
So Uzma got one fight that he's lost.

2419
02:16:08,610 --> 02:16:11,250
Colby Covenant has one fight
that he's lost. That's what this,

2420
02:16:11,340 --> 02:16:13,650
I'm all about stories like the storyline.

2421
02:16:14,010 --> 02:16:18,900
So the only fight that Colby Covington
lost to was what? Leon Edwards?

2422
02:16:19,140 --> 02:16:21,960
Yes. He choked him out.
Right. Short notice fight.

2423
02:16:22,100 --> 02:16:24,980
They took in the UFC and he was injured
at something fucked up with ribs.

2424
02:16:24,990 --> 02:16:29,160
So he lost by via choke.
Who's my beat? Leanne?

2425
02:16:29,800 --> 02:16:33,340
The God that [inaudible] lost too
early on Colby covers him beat.

2426
02:16:33,370 --> 02:16:37,220
So BofA day losses are two people that
that's just a weird storyline. Yeah,

2427
02:16:37,320 --> 02:16:40,740
but that's MMA. Math. Yeah, I know,
but no and I, I'm not comparing them,

2428
02:16:40,741 --> 02:16:44,620
I'm just saying that the fact that they
both got one loss and eight supposedly

2429
02:16:44,621 --> 02:16:47,920
hate each other and is two
people they've beat it is crazy.

2430
02:16:48,250 --> 02:16:50,120
Ho fighters careers just changed.

2431
02:16:50,130 --> 02:16:53,380
They become a different person and
whoever they are like four years ago,

2432
02:16:53,381 --> 02:16:55,510
you really can't compare
them to whoever they are now.

2433
02:16:56,170 --> 02:16:59,350
The Colby Covington thing is interesting
because he really did beat the shit out

2434
02:16:59,351 --> 02:17:01,630
of Damien. Maya, you know, and you know,

2435
02:17:01,631 --> 02:17:04,540
he really did hot failed Los Angeles.

2436
02:17:04,570 --> 02:17:09,010
I don't know if Damien Mayan was three
rounds. I feel like it was a main event.

2437
02:17:09,310 --> 02:17:12,320
You might be right though. Three rounds.
Three rounds. Cause he was in Brazil.

2438
02:17:12,450 --> 02:17:17,170
This was five rounds. Yeah.
Yeah. But Don Dosantos one,

2439
02:17:17,171 --> 02:17:20,980
two rounds. Right. Three to two.
Did he think on score cards?

2440
02:17:21,070 --> 02:17:25,090
He took them down and everything. Yeah,
he did. Yeah. Now with tomorrow Kamara,

2441
02:17:25,330 --> 02:17:28,120
it was brutal. They level change
that Kemal do with that level,

2442
02:17:28,210 --> 02:17:30,280
like threatened to take
down. He will piece you up.

2443
02:17:30,430 --> 02:17:33,730
Cause Henry who's got his striking
crazy and is getting better. Yup.

2444
02:17:34,030 --> 02:17:38,320
Oh for sure. Well he did fantastic
against Woodley Woodley in real trouble.

2445
02:17:38,350 --> 02:17:42,790
From striking. Yeah. Well it looks good
in this comeback trails though too.

2446
02:17:42,850 --> 02:17:45,760
All the oily managed that he's
doing. He really got married,

2447
02:17:46,050 --> 02:17:49,550
dedicated Willie didn't want me to film
him the week of the fight by this game

2448
02:17:49,551 --> 02:17:52,660
and shit. Uh, Dean Thomas came
over to me and said, hey man,

2449
02:17:52,661 --> 02:17:56,860
I willy don't want you to film
him. It's another distraction.

2450
02:17:56,980 --> 02:18:01,270
If I get it, I get, I was mad. I was,
I was kind of, I wouldn't say mad.

2451
02:18:01,271 --> 02:18:04,060
I was butt hurt cause I like
willing, I'm like, come on man,

2452
02:18:04,061 --> 02:18:07,510
I've been filming you all week. And then
all of a sudden day before the fight,

2453
02:18:07,570 --> 02:18:11,330
hey, his head, he doesn't want anything
there, you know, just wants to see,

2454
02:18:11,360 --> 02:18:13,510
I mean he had so many distractions.

2455
02:18:13,511 --> 02:18:17,350
He released the fucking album with
Wiz Khalifa. You know, he was touring,

2456
02:18:17,380 --> 02:18:20,230
he was doing a rap videos,
slept masses. He's, yeah,

2457
02:18:20,231 --> 02:18:23,050
and he's doing this fucking TMZ,
Hollywood shit that he does.

2458
02:18:23,051 --> 02:18:24,250
He does a lot of shit.

2459
02:18:24,430 --> 02:18:28,390
But I like that he does a lot of shit
because he's recognizing that he's going

2460
02:18:28,391 --> 02:18:32,820
to have a time outside of fighting. You
gotta have you gotta have a post line?

2461
02:18:32,840 --> 02:18:36,370
He's got a real opportunity to make
something happen forever. I mean,

2462
02:18:36,371 --> 02:18:40,870
he's a smart guy. Inspirational guy.
Yeah, I lot, listen, I have none,

2463
02:18:40,871 --> 02:18:45,610
but listen, I love after the fight with,
you know willy mom, that was amazing.

2464
02:18:45,640 --> 02:18:49,050
I love, I like Willie, his
team, his mom, his, his,

2465
02:18:49,051 --> 02:18:53,140
his mom was talking to me and it was
more both tearing up cause like we were

2466
02:18:53,141 --> 02:18:54,770
talking about and we played it when,

2467
02:18:54,790 --> 02:18:59,790
I mean his mom just goes over and we're
braces Comoro and Kamara was crying and

2468
02:19:00,090 --> 02:19:02,890
who his mom was like, she, she
coming for you, baby coming for you.

2469
02:19:02,891 --> 02:19:07,330
You better be prepared for Mama Willie.
Look got tears in your eyes right now.

2470
02:19:07,890 --> 02:19:11,680
Yeah. That, listen, that's the
sport man. This sport is this, this,

2471
02:19:11,710 --> 02:19:15,100
this emotions and soul
in this sport. It's like,

2472
02:19:15,101 --> 02:19:18,560
it's not just the winning and losing.
It's like your life is on the line.

2473
02:19:18,730 --> 02:19:21,070
So imagine what I feel
when I'm documented.

2474
02:19:21,280 --> 02:19:24,130
You're right next to them because you
know, like say it like a journalist,

2475
02:19:24,280 --> 02:19:28,230
right? That got to work for a show.
They reporting, they interview

2476
02:19:28,380 --> 02:19:32,120
and guys, I'm in the gym with
these guys every day. Like I'm,

2477
02:19:32,240 --> 02:19:35,660
I'm literally in it sweating
in a gym with these guys.

2478
02:19:35,960 --> 02:19:40,100
Go on with them to eat, going to
stay tonight, sleeping on a couch.

2479
02:19:40,370 --> 02:19:44,090
Like I'm doing all of that stuff to
be next to these guys to tell them,

2480
02:19:44,260 --> 02:19:48,140
why are you doing that? Well, because
it's yours. Yeah, this is all your,

2481
02:19:48,950 --> 02:19:49,810
your doing this, you know,

2482
02:19:49,870 --> 02:19:53,770
working for some fucking company and we
got some asshole producer who's telling

2483
02:19:53,771 --> 02:19:55,820
you what to do. It wouldn't
be the same. You wouldn't,

2484
02:19:55,930 --> 02:19:58,870
you wouldn't [inaudible] I wouldn't
do it. Not only would you not do it,

2485
02:19:58,871 --> 02:20:02,020
you wouldn't be as motivated. You
wouldn't, but more importantly,

2486
02:20:02,050 --> 02:20:06,160
it wouldn't be the singular vision that
you get when you know that it's coming

2487
02:20:06,161 --> 02:20:09,670
from one person. When you know something's
coming from one person, you get this,

2488
02:20:09,671 --> 02:20:13,420
like you get a feeling like this
is, this is will Harris. He's there,

2489
02:20:13,421 --> 02:20:15,580
he's filming this, he's admitting
it. He's putting it together.

2490
02:20:15,700 --> 02:20:17,140
He's putting it out. Here's the video.

2491
02:20:17,320 --> 02:20:21,520
That's a beautiful thing about the
internet man really is. It's amazing.

2492
02:20:21,550 --> 02:20:25,690
It really is. It doesn't exist in any
other media. There's nothing like that.

2493
02:20:25,870 --> 02:20:28,300
There's nothing like that ever
in the history of the world.

2494
02:20:28,480 --> 02:20:30,430
If you wanted to put out
something like you've done,

2495
02:20:30,580 --> 02:20:33,970
you need a gang of people behind. You
needed a network, you needed a deduction,

2496
02:20:34,430 --> 02:20:35,920
companies, someone to choose
you, you need to someone.

2497
02:20:35,921 --> 02:20:38,260
There's probably four of the guys that
wanted to do what you're doing with five

2498
02:20:38,330 --> 02:20:39,490
of the guys, 10 a dozen.

2499
02:20:39,760 --> 02:20:42,910
Everybody wants it and they have to pick
you and then these other guys would be

2500
02:20:42,911 --> 02:20:47,080
trying to like fuck you up from
behind. And it happens. It happens.

2501
02:20:47,440 --> 02:20:48,440
And I, and that's what I listen.

2502
02:20:48,470 --> 02:20:51,980
I try to portray that message to
every single person that messaged me.

2503
02:20:52,880 --> 02:20:56,360
This is not easy. Like it's
a lot of sacrificing this,

2504
02:20:56,361 --> 02:20:59,030
you have to be willing to
put in years to do this.

2505
02:20:59,240 --> 02:21:02,360
I'm going on two years in
August 14th will be full,

2506
02:21:02,361 --> 02:21:05,750
two years of committed to an
anatomy of a vita and I'm, it's,

2507
02:21:06,020 --> 02:21:11,000
it's a baby stage to me like I could
because of what I know it can become.

2508
02:21:11,510 --> 02:21:14,930
You know, millions of subscribers are
firmly, firmly so to me, I'm like,

2509
02:21:14,931 --> 02:21:18,230
you know what? I'm not going to stop
no matter what. I'm not going to stop.

2510
02:21:18,231 --> 02:21:19,820
I want this to be the biggest thing ever.

2511
02:21:19,821 --> 02:21:23,120
I want a guy that's not even
in on the radar right now.

2512
02:21:23,121 --> 02:21:27,290
I want to discover on him and then he
become a heavyweight champion or world or

2513
02:21:27,660 --> 02:21:29,900
UFC champion or Bella torque champion.

2514
02:21:30,170 --> 02:21:35,060
And that's the thing that I get out of
it all is the fact that I can just create

2515
02:21:35,061 --> 02:21:37,990
what I want. Yes. With whoever you know.

2516
02:21:38,070 --> 02:21:39,830
You know I I thought about it
though there I was like, man,

2517
02:21:39,831 --> 02:21:43,070
I need to put more women on a channel
of women fighters and promote more women

2518
02:21:43,640 --> 02:21:46,940
because I feel like they
don't get promoted as well.
I want to get Amanda Nunez,

2519
02:21:47,930 --> 02:21:52,010
um, Ashley Yoder. I was supposed to go
with her and Dan Henderson and Temecula.

2520
02:21:52,011 --> 02:21:55,340
I wish I could've got them on.
But that's the type of like,

2521
02:21:55,400 --> 02:21:58,210
cause it's the freedom to do it.
Yes. They don't have to pay me. Yeah.

2522
02:21:58,490 --> 02:22:03,350
I just go do it and make it and put it
out there and hopefully somebody latches

2523
02:22:03,351 --> 02:22:05,960
on and say we want to be a part of
this, this movement and anatomy.

2524
02:22:06,510 --> 02:22:10,610
[inaudible] Valentino Schiff. Chenko
and her sister, they are some beasts.

2525
02:22:10,611 --> 02:22:12,200
She scares the shit out of me.

2526
02:22:12,530 --> 02:22:15,710
I just want to film her doing that little
dance shit. I know. It's crazy, right?

2527
02:22:15,740 --> 02:22:19,990
That fucking head kick on Jessica. I like
woo. I was supposed to go get her. Uh,

2528
02:22:20,060 --> 02:22:24,140
Eric Nixon, her coach. She was like,
Oh, come down to Vegas and get Jessica.

2529
02:22:25,380 --> 02:22:26,070
That was a tough

2530
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:30,780
one. I liked a Jessica was, you know, she
took it well though. She took it well,

2531
02:22:31,080 --> 02:22:35,730
but she was a severely outclass.
That was a, a bad level.

2532
02:22:36,280 --> 02:22:37,320
It's levels, levels,

2533
02:22:37,710 --> 02:22:40,710
but I don't think there's a level
higher than Valentina there. There,

2534
02:22:40,740 --> 02:22:44,520
there's people on her level, but
there's no level higher that that's,

2535
02:22:44,580 --> 02:22:49,350
that was a, a little a debatable
match against Nunez. The second one,

2536
02:22:49,351 --> 02:22:53,700
right? Yes. The one that people say she
should have won very, very close fight,

2537
02:22:54,060 --> 02:22:55,650
but Nunez is a bigger girl.

2538
02:22:56,220 --> 02:22:59,760
New Nana's is a legit one 35 or she's
not going to make one 25, you know?

2539
02:22:59,761 --> 02:23:02,340
And when she knocked outside
bark, everybody was like,

2540
02:23:02,341 --> 02:23:06,890
what in the fuck she
follow that line. Cyborgs.

2541
02:23:07,080 --> 02:23:11,700
And she's Cha. Excuse me. She's chomping
at the bit to do it again. Listen.

2542
02:23:11,701 --> 02:23:13,140
She's like, set it up
again. I'll do it again.

2543
02:23:13,210 --> 02:23:16,830
What do you think if Cyborg
left the UFC, where do she go?

2544
02:23:17,340 --> 02:23:20,040
One FC maybe, but who's
what? Fighters is over there.

2545
02:23:20,270 --> 02:23:22,230
They'll get some fighters
for, they'll find some.

2546
02:23:22,231 --> 02:23:25,890
There's some Moitai champions that'll
fight her. She was at ask women,

2547
02:23:25,920 --> 02:23:30,230
I talked to sideboard. She wants that
fight bad. The Amanda Nunez Fire. Yes.

2548
02:23:30,231 --> 02:23:33,840
She wanted a bench or she does. It might
happen since it was Ryan rock 'em sock.

2549
02:23:33,841 --> 02:23:37,020
'Em Robot. It was rock 'em sock 'em
robots, but only one person was rocking.

2550
02:23:37,021 --> 02:23:39,270
That's what I'm saying
from her. Yeah. She was.

2551
02:23:39,300 --> 02:23:43,860
She was moving towards and Amanda was
just doing the perfect thing to deal with

2552
02:23:43,861 --> 02:23:47,040
that style. I thought it was
going to be a harder fight.

2553
02:23:47,760 --> 02:23:50,160
I thought if Amanda was going to beat
her, it's going to be by decision.

2554
02:23:50,340 --> 02:23:52,530
Oh really? I really did. I was shocked.

2555
02:23:52,560 --> 02:23:55,830
I didn't think she was gonna flatline or
we'd never even, Cyborg always gets up.

2556
02:23:55,950 --> 02:23:59,800
She felt during a barge in in
lion fight, who's, you know,

2557
02:23:59,850 --> 02:24:01,080
world class,

2558
02:24:01,081 --> 02:24:05,580
top of the food chain Moitai fighter and
she didn't have a single Moitai fight

2559
02:24:05,850 --> 02:24:10,480
and barge knocked her down
twice and Cyborg was chasing
her till the last second

2560
02:24:10,560 --> 02:24:13,230
that's called the bell and
she just seemed so durable.

2561
02:24:13,440 --> 02:24:18,000
I just never thought I would see our face
plant Amanda Nunez hits like she's got

2562
02:24:18,001 --> 02:24:22,320
bricks in her gloves just wow. She
just drops those fucking things.

2563
02:24:22,630 --> 02:24:26,220
Nicest person in the world. You
would never think she fought so nice.

2564
02:24:26,520 --> 02:24:30,990
And you know when when her and sidebar
were talking on that Shit, you know,

2565
02:24:30,991 --> 02:24:34,950
she seemed like cool and calm and
like just you wait and just you wait.

2566
02:24:35,650 --> 02:24:39,450
She just knows man, she hits when
she fucked up Ronda Rousey like that.

2567
02:24:39,451 --> 02:24:43,000
I was like, good Lord. That was
a fight where I remember the,

2568
02:24:43,200 --> 02:24:44,430
the run up to that fight.

2569
02:24:44,460 --> 02:24:49,460
That was one of the first fights that
when WME bought the UFC and they were

2570
02:24:50,011 --> 02:24:51,780
really promoting the shit
out of Ronda rousing.

2571
02:24:52,380 --> 02:24:56,850
Ronda was like walking around some big
mansion looking at the TV and they were

2572
02:24:56,851 --> 02:24:59,460
going to say, this is the big
comeback fight. And I was like,

2573
02:24:59,461 --> 02:25:04,461
you guys should be paying attention to
your first ever openly gay UFC champion

2574
02:25:05,940 --> 02:25:10,680
who happens to be a fucking murderer.
Happens to be a chick that Merck,

2575
02:25:10,710 --> 02:25:14,100
Misha Tate, happens to be a
chick that flatlines people.

2576
02:25:14,250 --> 02:25:16,860
She's probably one of the
hardest punchers in the women's,

2577
02:25:17,130 --> 02:25:21,060
in any women's combat
sport. I mean, fuck man,

2578
02:25:21,061 --> 02:25:25,180
she hits fucking hard music. You know,

2579
02:25:25,310 --> 02:25:27,010
you've got to go back to an wolves,

2580
02:25:27,220 --> 02:25:31,010
one punch Kao and boxing
to see a woman wolf beast.

2581
02:25:31,720 --> 02:25:35,590
But you got to go to that to
see a woman who hits that hard.

2582
02:25:36,040 --> 02:25:40,960
And Amanda loves to fight, man. You
see, she loves it. She fucking loves it.

2583
02:25:40,961 --> 02:25:42,550
She, she feeds off of it.

2584
02:25:42,970 --> 02:25:46,480
And when they were setting that fight
up and they weren't giving Amanda Nunez

2585
02:25:46,481 --> 02:25:49,660
any credit and they were promoting her
at all, I'm like, you guys are crazy.

2586
02:25:49,660 --> 02:25:53,080
This is a bad fight for Ronda. This
is a bad fight because first of all,

2587
02:25:53,081 --> 02:25:53,441
that chicks,

2588
02:25:53,441 --> 02:25:57,130
a Brazilian jujitsu black belt Ronald's
not gonna submit her and she's probably

2589
02:25:57,131 --> 02:26:00,430
not going to get a dominant position on
her and when they're standing up on the

2590
02:26:00,431 --> 02:26:01,030
feet,

2591
02:26:01,030 --> 02:26:05,500
this chick is going to throw bricks
and it's not a good place for Rhonda.

2592
02:26:05,830 --> 02:26:07,630
That was like, it looked bad.

2593
02:26:08,650 --> 02:26:12,530
Like why did she second stumbling how
she was stumbling? She's out. I'm on,

2594
02:26:12,550 --> 02:26:14,740
you know, there was a lot
wrong there. A lot wrong.

2595
02:26:14,880 --> 02:26:19,880
Their motivation was a lot wrong there
to go from the Holly Holm Kao to that to

2596
02:26:19,991 --> 02:26:22,240
that should've had a warmup
fight. Right, for sure.

2597
02:26:22,510 --> 02:26:24,370
What is the reason why
boxing has warm up fights?

2598
02:26:24,371 --> 02:26:28,000
What is the percentage do you give
Holly home and chance against Nunez?

2599
02:26:30,220 --> 02:26:32,800
Well, Holly Holmes are world
class fighter. You know,

2600
02:26:32,950 --> 02:26:34,300
you got to give her a chance, get anybody,

2601
02:26:34,330 --> 02:26:36,310
she survived against Germane Duran domain,

2602
02:26:36,311 --> 02:26:40,780
knocked her down and germaned
around me is a legit world champion.

2603
02:26:40,781 --> 02:26:44,820
More Times that the fight with the late,
the late after the twice she got she,

2604
02:26:44,821 --> 02:26:48,430
she got though hind taken and she would
have won. I think she won that fight.

2605
02:26:48,460 --> 02:26:50,590
I think she won anyway.
Anyway, she dropped her twice.

2606
02:26:50,591 --> 02:26:53,110
She dropped her with a straight left
and she dropped her with a question mark

2607
02:26:53,111 --> 02:26:56,050
kick. Um, I thought
you won that fight, but

2608
02:26:57,810 --> 02:27:00,280
man it was just fucking
murderer man. It's hard to,

2609
02:27:00,550 --> 02:27:03,430
it's hard to pick against the magic
of Holly shocked the world twice.

2610
02:27:03,431 --> 02:27:07,450
She could look, she couldn't, I like
her too. She's, she's an amazing person.

2611
02:27:07,640 --> 02:27:11,530
Hey she, she hates the cameras, does
she? She won't let me film her. Why?

2612
02:27:11,560 --> 02:27:14,080
She won't let nobody film her. Just
distractions. She just don't like,

2613
02:27:14,260 --> 02:27:18,700
she don't like it. And that's one of
the girls I would love to do. Like,

2614
02:27:19,090 --> 02:27:21,450
you know, cause this is like
fun for me. So I'm like, Oh,

2615
02:27:21,451 --> 02:27:23,110
I would love to just
get this person on it.

2616
02:27:23,950 --> 02:27:25,930
Let the world get to
know this fighter. Right.

2617
02:27:25,931 --> 02:27:29,380
Like I get it from their perspective
though, cause it is a distraction.

2618
02:27:29,470 --> 02:27:32,170
It's another thing, another
factor to consider in.

2619
02:27:32,171 --> 02:27:35,410
Some people don't mind it like something.
I Bet Henry Udo probably likes it.

2620
02:27:36,200 --> 02:27:37,120
Yeah. In a way.

2621
02:27:37,240 --> 02:27:41,500
Some some I've gotten away from going
to fight week cause it's Kinda the same

2622
02:27:41,501 --> 02:27:42,670
thing. I've done it a lot.

2623
02:27:42,671 --> 02:27:46,930
So I like to just go away before a fight
and just document this stuff and then

2624
02:27:46,931 --> 02:27:50,890
release it during the fight week. What
is it like at a bad motherfucker ranch?

2625
02:27:52,030 --> 02:27:54,310
Donald Cowboys place? I haven't been
there yet. I've only been a Jackson.

2626
02:27:54,460 --> 02:27:58,820
Oh okay. Listen, I got to go
there for like a week there.

2627
02:27:58,830 --> 02:28:03,640
Just be with him and Schilling and
that's the place to go cause they're all

2628
02:28:03,641 --> 02:28:08,641
doing mushrooms and fucking jumping
jetski fresh eggs and stuff like that.

2629
02:28:09,790 --> 02:28:13,120
I would love to do that.
Cowboy is a, is cowboy.

2630
02:28:13,240 --> 02:28:17,560
Don't want them people like if you
see his face you think he's mean like

2631
02:28:17,561 --> 02:28:22,150
sometimes. But he's the coolest dude I
ever seen. Nice man. He's so nice. Like

2632
02:28:22,220 --> 02:28:25,700
that's crazy. Like when him and
when him and Mike Perry fall,

2633
02:28:26,840 --> 02:28:31,840
I had access to my period at fight week
and I reached out to cowboys team and

2634
02:28:31,911 --> 02:28:36,030
said I want to be neutral on this and
film both of Y'all that week in cowboy.

2635
02:28:36,031 --> 02:28:38,540
I said yeah, no problem.
So he let me hang with him.

2636
02:28:38,720 --> 02:28:42,650
I was with Perry after the
fight. They met, they talked,

2637
02:28:42,651 --> 02:28:45,830
I had that little famous moment where
they met and you know, cowboy was like,

2638
02:28:45,831 --> 02:28:49,250
you lit the fire in me and repair.
He was like, what? He was like,

2639
02:28:49,280 --> 02:28:53,370
you talking all that shit lit the
fire in me that Instagram videos,

2640
02:28:53,390 --> 02:28:57,230
like I'm coming for you. All that
stuff. So that's probably one of the,

2641
02:28:57,800 --> 02:29:00,110
if people asked me what
my favorite moment is,

2642
02:29:00,410 --> 02:29:03,380
is probably the Mike Perry
week because of just,

2643
02:29:03,440 --> 02:29:07,940
I had both of them and then I had the
raw emotion of Mike Periatt that he lost

2644
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:11,840
in a locker room. Like where he, he
looked at the, he looked at the sky,

2645
02:29:11,841 --> 02:29:15,290
I was like, Damn God, you can
let me out the first round.

2646
02:29:17,580 --> 02:29:22,310
He like, Damn. It was embarrassing.
But it was a funny guy, man. He is.

2647
02:29:22,311 --> 02:29:26,860
He is a just start. He can do
anything. I feel like, I mean he,

2648
02:29:26,861 --> 02:29:29,500
he's gonna get better and
fighting. He can be in movies.

2649
02:29:29,790 --> 02:29:32,550
Well he's gotten better since the
move to Jackson's. He really has.

2650
02:29:32,551 --> 02:29:37,050
He's got more embedded. Went back
where? To a fusion XL in Florida.

2651
02:29:37,051 --> 02:29:39,810
He went back to his original team after
the cowboy fight. Interesting. Yeah.

2652
02:29:39,811 --> 02:29:42,420
And wonder why? I don't
know. I don't know. Cool.

2653
02:29:42,421 --> 02:29:46,000
But he's not a Jackson's anymore.
He's at a Fusionex thing.

2654
02:29:46,020 --> 02:29:47,100
I'm not aware of fusion.

2655
02:29:47,101 --> 02:29:49,660
I don't know if they have good
trainers or anything like that.

2656
02:29:49,670 --> 02:29:51,630
That's what Jack or a
train. Oh, okay. Yeah.

2657
02:29:51,690 --> 02:29:54,730
I liked what they were doing
for him know that Jackson's,

2658
02:29:54,760 --> 02:29:58,280
I like how they were giving him a more
measured Lester man calculate. Yes. Yeah.

2659
02:29:58,530 --> 02:30:01,350
Yeah. Frank the tank, they give
them a more calculated approach,

2660
02:30:01,380 --> 02:30:04,890
making them fight more intelligently,
more, more of a game plan.

2661
02:30:05,220 --> 02:30:08,130
Cause he's always going to be wild and
he's always going to have that power that

2662
02:30:08,131 --> 02:30:11,580
Paul failed to fight. Yeah,
that was wild. That was why.

2663
02:30:11,581 --> 02:30:13,980
But if I wanted to see that
fight a Felder, first of all,

2664
02:30:13,981 --> 02:30:15,120
Felder is a different way class,

2665
02:30:15,121 --> 02:30:17,670
but it felt it didn't throw that
spinning back fist and bounce it off his

2666
02:30:17,671 --> 02:30:22,110
forehead and snap his arm in half. You
know, they should run that back. Huh?

2667
02:30:22,890 --> 02:30:25,610
Um, well I don't think Felder
should be fighting one 70, you know,

2668
02:30:25,620 --> 02:30:29,190
because I don't think Perry has a
chance in hell and making one 55 no,

2669
02:30:29,270 --> 02:30:32,760
that Felder can till versus Perry
is a good one. That's a great, but,

2670
02:30:33,050 --> 02:30:36,090
and they hate each other. I liked
that, especially after till coming off,

2671
02:30:36,091 --> 02:30:38,400
getting knocked out by mom's
Vidar, two losses in a row.

2672
02:30:38,460 --> 02:30:41,400
So that's a great fight for two
losses in a row. But the big one,

2673
02:30:41,430 --> 02:30:44,880
the big one was a Mazda dog
cause Monzo dog flatlined them.

2674
02:30:45,450 --> 02:30:50,340
That was a d I thought
that was disrespectful. Um,

2675
02:30:50,770 --> 02:30:55,350
uh, the way the, the, they
had set it up where um,

2676
02:30:55,610 --> 02:31:00,540
the bookies had set it up where Tyron
Woodley was the underdog. I was like,

2677
02:31:00,541 --> 02:31:03,230
you guys are out or your fall,
you're in Dallas. I mean, you're out.

2678
02:31:03,460 --> 02:31:06,330
You're out of your fucking mind. I don't
know what hype you're buying into them.

2679
02:31:06,480 --> 02:31:07,620
We've never seen this guy on the ground.

2680
02:31:08,010 --> 02:31:12,300
We've never seen this guy with a guy
like Woodley and like Woodley hits hard,

2681
02:31:13,380 --> 02:31:17,790
tasty, hard. He's so fast and wrestling
wise, I mean it's not even close.

2682
02:31:18,510 --> 02:31:20,070
I thought that was,
I'm like, yeah, he beat

2683
02:31:20,070 --> 02:31:23,970
cowboy. Yeah, he looked great. Yeah,
he beat Wonderboy. But you know,

2684
02:31:24,330 --> 02:31:27,420
I mean it was a fight where he clipped
and Wonderboy boy was one really good

2685
02:31:27,421 --> 02:31:30,630
shot. You know, he, he hit him with one
really good shot and a good five rounds,

2686
02:31:30,930 --> 02:31:35,310
one column, a high train. Uh,
but I feel like promotions,

2687
02:31:35,340 --> 02:31:38,010
they did it with Pico, now
he got two straight losses.

2688
02:31:38,400 --> 02:31:42,870
Well you get excited about a guy because
the guy has some something special and

2689
02:31:42,871 --> 02:31:45,480
sometimes those guys that have
something special, they never,

2690
02:31:45,481 --> 02:31:49,530
like Uriah hall never really became
what everybody thought he was going to

2691
02:31:49,531 --> 02:31:52,590
become. We saw Uriah Hall and the
ultimate fighter. We're like, Holy Shit,

2692
02:31:52,591 --> 02:31:55,800
this is the next Anderson Silva. Like,
look at this guys. We'll kick in.

2693
02:31:55,801 --> 02:31:59,130
People in the head. Yeah, he
is built like a Greek God.

2694
02:31:59,131 --> 02:32:03,000
He moves like a fucking gazelle. He just
had this perfect style. Like Holy Shit,

2695
02:32:03,001 --> 02:32:07,530
look at this guy. But never
quite became who we thought.

2696
02:32:07,531 --> 02:32:10,500
And then the Paula Kosta Phi, you
seem to getting beaten down by Kosta.

2697
02:32:10,530 --> 02:32:13,860
He was fucking him up though. At
first with this shit at jabs. Yeah,

2698
02:32:15,060 --> 02:32:18,840
the Jabs Kosta can take it. I was
just like him versus yellow or marrow.

2699
02:32:18,900 --> 02:32:23,310
Good googly Mooglie. Is that
a crazy fight that's here.

2700
02:32:23,340 --> 02:32:27,150
That's going to be in California and,
Huh? Yeah. Woo. With Nate and Pedis.

2701
02:32:27,151 --> 02:32:31,020
That's the bottle about battle of
the best bodies ever goes to. Yes.

2702
02:32:31,410 --> 02:32:34,340
He inspired me. How you look
like that still at 40 something.

2703
02:32:34,980 --> 02:32:38,370
He's got the freak genetics man. He talked
about it on the podcast. He was like,

2704
02:32:38,430 --> 02:32:40,770
go look Cuba. Everybody looked like that.

2705
02:32:41,310 --> 02:32:43,860
He was saying that everybody looked
like that. It's just amazing.

2706
02:32:43,861 --> 02:32:45,700
Genetics and then Costa. Well,

2707
02:32:46,070 --> 02:32:49,500
it's also like when you think
about what UL has gone through,

2708
02:32:49,740 --> 02:32:53,030
that Cuban wrestling program,
man, they, they, they,

2709
02:32:53,031 --> 02:32:57,570
they just call everyone
who's not an elite five star.

2710
02:32:57,570 --> 02:33:00,000
Super a plus athlete. You ain't making it.

2711
02:33:00,210 --> 02:33:03,120
He was telling me that the people
that are the best, they eat more,

2712
02:33:03,450 --> 02:33:06,870
they get better food and they eat more
and they sleep in better places and they

2713
02:33:06,871 --> 02:33:09,000
set it up. Who you're training with,

2714
02:33:09,001 --> 02:33:11,910
all these other people
that want what you have.

2715
02:33:12,180 --> 02:33:15,060
So you're around them all the
time. If you see that podcast,

2716
02:33:15,120 --> 02:33:19,500
it's amazing cause deli joy was really
has to translate later with DOL.

2717
02:33:19,830 --> 02:33:22,060
Did he speak some English?
Yeah, he speaks a little,

2718
02:33:22,290 --> 02:33:25,830
but you know he needs help and Joey would
help them. You know, I never met him.

2719
02:33:26,580 --> 02:33:28,950
Yo Man, I haven't met him
yet. He's a great guy.

2720
02:33:29,520 --> 02:33:33,500
He's so super friendly and he's man,
he does shit to people inside the AUC.

2721
02:33:33,600 --> 02:33:36,240
You think he going to get
any of that money? Oh,

2722
02:33:36,241 --> 02:33:38,070
the 27 million from
the supplement company.

2723
02:33:38,240 --> 02:33:39,850
He for people don't know
what we're talking about.

2724
02:33:39,880 --> 02:33:42,660
He won a lawsuit against the supplement
company just like we were talking about

2725
02:33:42,661 --> 02:33:44,880
before with Sean O'Malley. Um,

2726
02:33:45,210 --> 02:33:50,210
they gave him tainted supplements
and he won $27 million.

2727
02:33:50,700 --> 02:33:54,210
It's a big company. See we, we
thought that it was a smaller company.

2728
02:33:54,211 --> 02:33:58,230
They would just go under. But this is
a big fucking company and you know,

2729
02:33:58,231 --> 02:34:01,920
their company makes $100 million a
year and they, they, they owe him 27.

2730
02:34:01,950 --> 02:34:05,760
Can you settle out of a settle?
Like the judgment was 27 million,

2731
02:34:05,761 --> 02:34:09,270
but could they be like, oh we gave
you 10 that's a good question.

2732
02:34:09,720 --> 02:34:11,070
I don't know how that works. If they do,

2733
02:34:11,071 --> 02:34:15,410
you probably could take that and assume
for the other 17 cause you have it.

2734
02:34:15,590 --> 02:34:18,190
Yeah, you gave me 10 I think
they're supposed to pay

2735
02:34:18,190 --> 02:34:21,110
27 million. I just don't. I
think they have to go bank.

2736
02:34:21,290 --> 02:34:24,970
He Shit never fight again. Well maybe
wants to though. He wants to be the champ.

2737
02:34:25,030 --> 02:34:29,200
You know he's got a legit shot.
I think he beat with a criminal.

2738
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:33,250
I think he won that second point.
I think you won. I think he won.

2739
02:34:33,340 --> 02:34:36,520
What about Rockhold going a
light heavyweight? I Dunno man.

2740
02:34:36,521 --> 02:34:39,240
The way he smashed rock holding
that fight. I was like, good Lord.

2741
02:34:39,400 --> 02:34:41,260
And he kissed him. Well Brock. Yeah,

2742
02:34:41,261 --> 02:34:43,960
he kissed it after he flat light and
Rocco was talking about kinds of shit.

2743
02:34:44,380 --> 02:34:47,200
But Rockhold said he was like
hitting someone's made out of steel.

2744
02:34:47,910 --> 02:34:51,250
You said he was so fucking
hard lit. Rocko told me that.

2745
02:34:51,251 --> 02:34:53,650
I've never felt a human
like that in my life.

2746
02:34:54,160 --> 02:34:58,030
That's super five-star elite
athlete. That's what that is.

2747
02:34:58,031 --> 02:35:01,750
That is is elite as you get when that
guy goes into the cage and you see him

2748
02:35:01,751 --> 02:35:05,800
move around and it's like, Jeez,
all you got neck, no neck. You go,

2749
02:35:05,801 --> 02:35:09,970
how the fuck is he 185 pounds,
dude, I weigh 200 pounds.

2750
02:35:10,090 --> 02:35:14,740
How the fuck is your Elvin Marrow?
185 pounds. That's crazy. Sane,

2751
02:35:15,010 --> 02:35:17,290
insane. I seen this a
side by side with him.

2752
02:35:17,291 --> 02:35:20,590
It could be be like when they were
younger and I was just like, man,

2753
02:35:20,591 --> 02:35:23,950
this dude is massive. He's
just Khabib as a bear. Yeah,

2754
02:35:24,040 --> 02:35:27,550
he's could be mystic as fuck.
Yo Wells on another level.

2755
02:35:27,580 --> 02:35:29,680
Freaking like a he a gargle.

2756
02:35:30,330 --> 02:35:32,350
He like built like a little
gargle or something like,

2757
02:35:32,890 --> 02:35:35,350
but when he knocked up Chris Weidman
with that flying nail, I was like,

2758
02:35:35,380 --> 02:35:37,180
Jesus Christ, he's just,

2759
02:35:37,630 --> 02:35:42,630
he has this like slow move and he
sets these traps on you and explodes.

2760
02:35:43,180 --> 02:35:47,260
Where do you feel like, like these
veterans, that sport is changing so much.

2761
02:35:47,261 --> 02:35:51,280
So now you starting to see all these,
these vets try to figure it out.

2762
02:35:51,281 --> 02:35:53,360
Like why am I going to light
heavyweight? Look this,

2763
02:35:53,420 --> 02:35:55,830
why am I going to lie to him? Healy man.

2764
02:35:56,660 --> 02:36:00,010
So it's like is these guys
like, because obviously this,

2765
02:36:00,310 --> 02:36:04,720
this with Dana White's contender series,
all these fresh guys are starting to,

2766
02:36:05,050 --> 02:36:06,610
the sport is changing so fast.

2767
02:36:06,611 --> 02:36:10,720
It's like now these guys are
starting to become the Tito Ortiz,

2768
02:36:10,750 --> 02:36:14,530
chuck Liddell [inaudible] of the,
now it's like this new fresh cause.

2769
02:36:14,730 --> 02:36:16,680
Thinking about it, it's like
Jordan said, it's going to all,

2770
02:36:16,720 --> 02:36:19,180
it's going to be somebody better
than me one day. Michael Jordan.

2771
02:36:19,840 --> 02:36:23,470
It's going to be somebody way
better than Jon Jones one day. Wow.

2772
02:36:23,620 --> 02:36:26,740
Think about that. The evolution of the
sport. Well that's what we've seen,

2773
02:36:26,741 --> 02:36:29,980
right? When you go back to the
old days, the tank, Abbott days,

2774
02:36:30,400 --> 02:36:33,130
and then you see what you see today
means that's unrecognizable and you're

2775
02:36:33,131 --> 02:36:38,131
talking about 1993 to 2019 what is it
going to be like in 2030 the field baroni

2776
02:36:38,681 --> 02:36:43,090
days? Oh my God. I mean what we're going
to look at in 10, 15 years from now,

2777
02:36:43,091 --> 02:36:44,250
it's probably just me.

2778
02:36:44,410 --> 02:36:48,700
You're seeing it now with the Tuesday
night contender series and with these guys

2779
02:36:48,701 --> 02:36:51,130
coming out of one that you
never even heard of before,

2780
02:36:51,131 --> 02:36:53,620
the Johnny Walkers where you
come from exactly that knots.

2781
02:36:53,630 --> 02:36:55,360
You can guy that knocked
out Eddie Alvarez,

2782
02:36:55,480 --> 02:36:58,960
like who the fuck is he like is a
monster. Never heard of him before. Right?

2783
02:36:59,260 --> 02:37:03,880
There's so many guys coming up right
now that no one's heard of that are just

2784
02:37:03,940 --> 02:37:08,860
dedicated and driven and focused and
they also have a higher benchmark.

2785
02:37:08,920 --> 02:37:10,500
You know, they've seen the mighty mouses,

2786
02:37:11,120 --> 02:37:14,200
they seen these guys and
they know that this is,

2787
02:37:14,410 --> 02:37:16,190
this is the level they're
trying to achieve.

2788
02:37:16,310 --> 02:37:19,990
Instead of, you know, looking back
at the early days, you know, we're,

2789
02:37:20,240 --> 02:37:23,180
we're guys just weren't as complete as
they are now. That's great. Do you think,

2790
02:37:23,780 --> 02:37:24,613
what is the,

2791
02:37:24,920 --> 02:37:29,920
Dana has said plenty of times there
will never be a cross promotion when you

2792
02:37:30,351 --> 02:37:32,390
think it is. Will it ever be po?

2793
02:37:32,440 --> 02:37:36,230
Would you like to see that
one versus UFC champion?

2794
02:37:36,370 --> 02:37:38,060
Like I'm the worst
businessman of all times.

2795
02:37:38,330 --> 02:37:41,690
I'm not about protecting any brands. I
don't give a fuck. I would be like, yeah,

2796
02:37:41,691 --> 02:37:44,650
come on, let's fight, let's fight. Let's
all make money. I don't care. You know,

2797
02:37:44,660 --> 02:37:47,980
I'm not, I'm the wrong guy for
that. Like if I was the, I would,

2798
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:51,230
I would make the UFC lose
money. I get paid people more.

2799
02:37:51,231 --> 02:37:56,000
I mean I'm not the right guy for that
job and I think that I would have a lot

2800
02:37:56,001 --> 02:37:57,680
more weight classes. First of all,

2801
02:37:57,681 --> 02:38:01,340
I wouldn't have a jump between 85 and
two oh five that to me looks crazy.

2802
02:38:01,550 --> 02:38:05,990
Like why don't you have 10 pounds
every 10 pounds? One 65 is neat. Yes.

2803
02:38:05,991 --> 02:38:08,720
One 65 is Kevin Lee would
be, could be champion easily.

2804
02:38:08,840 --> 02:38:13,840
Then (556) 057-0580 five all the way
on up 95 two oh five to 15 to 25 more

2805
02:38:16,600 --> 02:38:18,200
fights. Yes. More fights. More champions,

2806
02:38:18,380 --> 02:38:20,360
and I think it's the
right way to do it. Also,

2807
02:38:20,600 --> 02:38:24,170
I feel like it's weird that we call it
welterweight when it's one 70 and now

2808
02:38:24,530 --> 02:38:27,440
glory calls it welterweight at one 72
welterweight and like in the sugar ray

2809
02:38:27,441 --> 02:38:30,780
Leonard, Tommy Hearns days, it's
one 47 that's welterweight. Yeah,

2810
02:38:31,400 --> 02:38:34,460
because Mayweather was a welterweight
champion at one 40 that's 45 Singh.

2811
02:38:34,760 --> 02:38:35,593
That's boxing.

2812
02:38:35,720 --> 02:38:40,550
That's the fucking legitimate original
name for that weight class is the boxing

2813
02:38:40,551 --> 02:38:43,670
name. They called it welterweight.
They called it middle mate.

2814
02:38:43,880 --> 02:38:46,370
They called it cruiserweight.
It was their names.

2815
02:38:46,680 --> 02:38:50,180
So what we've done is some weird thing
where we decided why the fuck you want to

2816
02:38:50,181 --> 02:38:53,330
call it welterweight? It's like,
you know, I live on Brown street.

2817
02:38:53,370 --> 02:38:55,070
They have fuck you brown
streets over here now.

2818
02:38:55,220 --> 02:38:57,560
How can we have two brown
streets? That's ridiculous.

2819
02:38:58,030 --> 02:39:02,000
That doesn't make any sense. Why
wouldn't they create one 65 they should.

2820
02:39:02,030 --> 02:39:02,720
I don't know.

2821
02:39:02,720 --> 02:39:07,720
I don't like what would be
one of my relationships with
Dana white is we're very

2822
02:39:07,731 --> 02:39:10,820
good friends and she got the guy
to death of loved him forever.

2823
02:39:10,821 --> 02:39:14,480
He got me into commentary. If it wasn't
for him, I'd never done it, but I don't.

2824
02:39:14,630 --> 02:39:17,630
I don't do what he does. I don't
want that job. I said get it.

2825
02:39:17,810 --> 02:39:20,150
I don't agree with him on a lot of shit.

2826
02:39:20,330 --> 02:39:23,770
I don't agree with him on the weight
classes for sure. I don't think,

2827
02:39:23,810 --> 02:39:26,150
I don't agree with 'em on some
of the rules. I don't know.

2828
02:39:26,210 --> 02:39:28,240
There's a lot of shit. I
don't agree with it. You know,

2829
02:39:28,640 --> 02:39:31,250
there's a lot of things I don't
agree with in the sport in general.

2830
02:39:31,430 --> 02:39:33,560
I'm changing my opinion
though about bare knuckle.

2831
02:39:33,800 --> 02:39:38,330
I used to think there would be a, yeah,
you like it now? No, you don't. No,

2832
02:39:38,331 --> 02:39:42,800
this is for MMA. I feel like
people would get too cut up. Yeah.

2833
02:39:42,960 --> 02:39:45,920
I mean I'm, Hallie barely got hit. You
see his face? Yeah. What did you see?

2834
02:39:46,230 --> 02:39:48,510
Krystle evens face. Oh, dad
was brutal. The chrysalis.

2835
02:39:48,590 --> 02:39:51,980
Pull up that picture from
Chris Levens a thing today.

2836
02:39:53,150 --> 02:39:57,110
Dakota Cochran opened up just a
fucking river on his head. It's crazy.

2837
02:39:57,260 --> 02:40:02,260
I just feel like imagine seeing a woman
in her face look like we've already seen

2838
02:40:02,361 --> 02:40:05,890
it. I mean we've seen girls in Moy Times
in particular. Look at that Gash Dude.

2839
02:40:05,891 --> 02:40:07,800
That is crazy. I mean that,

2840
02:40:07,801 --> 02:40:12,050
that looks like you fell off a motorcycle
and hit a tree and these fans just

2841
02:40:12,051 --> 02:40:16,990
want more blood. Well it's just the
knuckles cut your face up so easy. Yeah,

2842
02:40:17,120 --> 02:40:20,130
and elbows cut your face up as
well and you can definitely look.

2843
02:40:20,131 --> 02:40:22,740
We've seen some horrific
gashes inside the UFC,

2844
02:40:23,160 --> 02:40:28,020
but I think it's harder to hit someone
with an elbow and cut them up like that.

2845
02:40:28,050 --> 02:40:30,690
It's like you're getting
a lot of punches in.

2846
02:40:30,691 --> 02:40:35,220
You're not getting a lot of elbows
and not getting as many you can.

2847
02:40:35,250 --> 02:40:36,720
Especially with ground and pound.

2848
02:40:36,960 --> 02:40:39,300
There's a real good argument
for for bare knuckle.

2849
02:40:39,330 --> 02:40:41,680
But when you watch these
bare knuckle fighters ever,

2850
02:40:41,850 --> 02:40:43,980
the break breaking their fucking
hands, almost every fight.

2851
02:40:44,660 --> 02:40:47,490
Everybody's getting their hands
broken. Him loves it. He's an animal.

2852
02:40:47,910 --> 02:40:51,600
Harlem is like crazy, you know,

2853
02:40:51,601 --> 02:40:54,990
they call him the goat and it's
this funny trolling with it,

2854
02:40:55,380 --> 02:40:58,640
but he's a game opponent. He been
fought. Michael Johnson, toughest head.

2855
02:40:58,660 --> 02:41:00,420
That was a tough fight
for Michael. He's tough.

2856
02:41:00,930 --> 02:41:04,500
The Russian hammers a good nickname
for that dude. And he's a hammer. Yeah.

2857
02:41:04,510 --> 02:41:08,310
Look at Paul. And he said,
I got only hit clean once.

2858
02:41:08,880 --> 02:41:11,700
He got hit clean a couple of times.
But the point is he didn't do shit.

2859
02:41:12,080 --> 02:41:16,720
And I was, and that was bad. I'm a fan
of Pauling, my NRG as a boxer, you know,

2860
02:41:16,800 --> 02:41:19,350
and I commentators, he's very, very,

2861
02:41:19,351 --> 02:41:22,110
very good as a commentator and
I think he beat Adrian pruner.

2862
02:41:22,111 --> 02:41:23,880
I think when he fought Broner
I think y'all pointed him,

2863
02:41:24,540 --> 02:41:29,460
but that's what those big ass gloves.
He doesn't have. Uh, no disrespect.

2864
02:41:29,670 --> 02:41:33,870
He doesn't have a good body for the
sport. He's not genetically gifted.

2865
02:41:33,990 --> 02:41:35,420
It's just not, it's just like he's,

2866
02:41:35,430 --> 02:41:40,140
he's got an awkward body like
athletically in an awkward way.

2867
02:41:40,141 --> 02:41:43,020
He's just really smart and really tough.

2868
02:41:43,260 --> 02:41:47,790
And he did the very best with what nature
gave him and he became world champion.

2869
02:41:48,140 --> 02:41:48,290
Yeah.

2870
02:41:48,290 --> 02:41:53,290
He became a legitimate world champion and
he knows so much about boxing but it's

2871
02:41:54,181 --> 02:41:57,870
a different world when you know the owner
bare knuckles like this proves that we

2872
02:41:57,871 --> 02:41:59,880
have the best combat sport in the world.

2873
02:42:00,600 --> 02:42:02,720
After that fight I was
like the fuck that guy.

2874
02:42:02,910 --> 02:42:06,840
There's some tie guys because our
fight beat a boxer. Yeah. Yeah.

2875
02:42:06,841 --> 02:42:07,920
But they don't, it's just,

2876
02:42:08,130 --> 02:42:10,560
you can't say it's the best combat sport
in the world cause you can't let them

2877
02:42:10,561 --> 02:42:15,120
elbow kick and punch a knee. It's
like this thing about boxing, right?

2878
02:42:15,150 --> 02:42:16,350
The sweet science.

2879
02:42:16,990 --> 02:42:21,780
The thing about it is if you only let a
guy box and with boxing gloves you get

2880
02:42:21,781 --> 02:42:22,770
to see some shit.

2881
02:42:22,980 --> 02:42:26,310
Like when you see Floyd fight where
guys are punching them and they can't

2882
02:42:26,311 --> 02:42:26,910
fucking hit him.

2883
02:42:26,910 --> 02:42:30,510
He's right in front of them and he's
moving away because his knowledge and

2884
02:42:30,511 --> 02:42:33,720
understanding of what you can do with
those two weapons is just off the charts.

2885
02:42:33,721 --> 02:42:37,950
He's got it focused like a goddamn
laser beam and you just can't touch him.

2886
02:42:38,010 --> 02:42:41,550
He's better than anybody that's ever
been in terms of like his defensive,

2887
02:42:41,830 --> 02:42:45,470
like he gets hit less than anybody
who's ever fought and had 50 wins.

2888
02:42:45,490 --> 02:42:49,230
There's nobody to get some of that
stuff he have after he beat Canelo.

2889
02:42:50,460 --> 02:42:54,300
That's a good question. He
fought Pacquiao after that. Yes.

2890
02:42:54,330 --> 02:42:56,700
He fought Pat Cardo. He fought Berto.

2891
02:42:56,701 --> 02:43:01,230
He falls at the [inaudible]
fight. They fight.

2892
02:43:01,231 --> 02:43:03,000
Tim Bradley. Bradley fell out.

2893
02:43:03,001 --> 02:43:07,320
He followed him on Donna right
twice if it was after. No, no.

2894
02:43:07,321 --> 02:43:10,320
I think the Madonna fight was before and
that was one of the things that gave a

2895
02:43:10,321 --> 02:43:12,240
lot of people that
thought Canelo had a shock

2896
02:43:12,370 --> 02:43:12,760
as my,

2897
02:43:12,760 --> 02:43:16,300
Donna cracked him in that first round
member or not first round the first fight

2898
02:43:16,470 --> 02:43:17,920
rats right before the bill. Yeah,

2899
02:43:18,070 --> 02:43:20,770
right before the bell and Womble
them a little bit. He stumble. Yeah.

2900
02:43:22,240 --> 02:43:26,110
Both of them were before. After they
were, yeah, so that's what I'm saying.

2901
02:43:26,490 --> 02:43:31,240
Floyd has some fights after, so, oh,
that's right. The Guerrero fight.

2902
02:43:31,540 --> 02:43:35,260
Canelo record was crazy. Even me. Yeah.

2903
02:43:36,280 --> 02:43:39,820
Look, man, Floyd is a motherfucker,
dude. He's a motherfucker.

2904
02:43:39,821 --> 02:43:42,310
You might not like the
style or the way he fights,

2905
02:43:42,970 --> 02:43:47,970
but the boxers that appreciate how
difficult it is to do what he does.

2906
02:43:48,550 --> 02:43:51,100
He's a, he's a, a new benchmark.

2907
02:43:51,700 --> 02:43:56,280
He's a new benchmark in terms of how to
get out of that sport with getting the,

2908
02:43:56,310 --> 02:44:00,100
the very least amount of damage
and fighting the most masterfully.

2909
02:44:00,330 --> 02:44:02,830
And he's really changed
the way Canelo fights.

2910
02:44:02,831 --> 02:44:06,580
You see Canelo against Danny
Jacobs. Canals is in a lot
of his shit stuff. Yeah.

2911
02:44:06,670 --> 02:44:08,380
I mean, he's like, that's
how you do it, man.

2912
02:44:09,540 --> 02:44:11,920
[inaudible] crazy when
people like Floyd shift,

2913
02:44:12,200 --> 02:44:15,250
like his version of Canelo is like, no,
that was way bigger than that. Come on.

2914
02:44:15,490 --> 02:44:19,210
This whole totally different thing.
I mean, it was a legit middle way.

2915
02:44:19,211 --> 02:44:23,790
Now you know what the triple g Canelo
trilogy reminds me of member when a pack

2916
02:44:23,791 --> 02:44:28,390
out fault. Um, who was it
that knocked him out? Oh,

2917
02:44:28,391 --> 02:44:32,530
my blankets. Yeah. One when Mel,
well Marcus, they fought two,

2918
02:44:32,680 --> 02:44:37,030
three times a pack. Y'All won twice. Um,

2919
02:44:37,560 --> 02:44:40,000
and mark has flat lined, they flat
line them and I was like, Dang,

2920
02:44:40,001 --> 02:44:41,830
what if triple g get his third chance?

2921
02:44:41,831 --> 02:44:46,270
And that happens cause there's similar
stories like he won, he won twice.

2922
02:44:46,271 --> 02:44:48,270
Everybody said Marquez
beat him twice. Yeah.

2923
02:44:48,310 --> 02:44:53,190
And then they finally fought again
and then he beat them. Yeah. And Pat,

2924
02:44:53,360 --> 02:44:56,830
y'all still fighting though? Yeah. How
is that pause fighting Keith Thurman?

2925
02:44:56,980 --> 02:45:01,450
I know that's a tough fight.
That's danger. You can win
it. Yeah, he can win it.

2926
02:45:01,480 --> 02:45:04,180
He can just knock out his last
appointment. Yeah. Yeah. Listen,

2927
02:45:04,480 --> 02:45:08,920
PACU is still good. He's still good.
And after he got shoulder surgery,

2928
02:45:09,250 --> 02:45:12,670
you know what I mean? He's,
he's as good as ever been. Yeah.

2929
02:45:13,060 --> 02:45:18,060
I just hate that he keep using that
excuse that he has showed her as messed up

2930
02:45:18,191 --> 02:45:20,170
against when he fought Floyd. Yeah.

2931
02:45:20,680 --> 02:45:23,200
It would have been interesting to
see him 100% healthy against Floyd.

2932
02:45:23,201 --> 02:45:27,910
But Floyd was smart with him. He's
like, not yet. Not yet. Not yet.

2933
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:28,833
Not yet.

2934
02:45:29,020 --> 02:45:32,770
Isn't it weird that people say he waited
till he got old but packout was older

2935
02:45:32,771 --> 02:45:36,770
than Floyd Floyd's older than pack
yet. Yeah, he's older than pack. Yeah.

2936
02:45:36,771 --> 02:45:39,490
But he did wait until pack.
Y'all got a little worn. Hey,

2937
02:45:39,610 --> 02:45:42,250
I'm sure he got knocked up by mark
as like, okay, yeah, let's go.

2938
02:45:42,430 --> 02:45:46,750
It looks like now's the time. It still
wasn't close, but it was also, you know,

2939
02:45:46,751 --> 02:45:49,120
Floyd is incredibly smart
when it comes to promotion.

2940
02:45:49,121 --> 02:45:52,690
He's not going to let anybody get 50
50 with him. It's like, no, no, no.

2941
02:45:52,720 --> 02:45:56,290
That's the whole Eddie Hearn shit though.
That's what, and then what can happen?

2942
02:45:56,710 --> 02:46:01,370
Well, that shit is crazy. It's,
what did you hear about, um,

2943
02:46:01,780 --> 02:46:05,340
about him getting hurt before the
fight? I heard that he had a pen, uh,

2944
02:46:05,470 --> 02:46:08,770
anxiety attack. Yeah, I heard
it. I heard he got knocked out.

2945
02:46:08,990 --> 02:46:11,420
That's what I heard. Yeah. We're
talking about Anthony. Joshua.

2946
02:46:11,421 --> 02:46:13,280
That's what I'm saying. Yeah,
but for the people, isn't it?

2947
02:46:13,610 --> 02:46:16,970
We heard that Eddie Hearn is
the promoter of Anthony Joshua.

2948
02:46:16,971 --> 02:46:20,480
And what I had heard was that he got flat
line and training or dropped and hurt

2949
02:46:20,481 --> 02:46:23,990
bad and training and it was
like leading up to the fight,

2950
02:46:23,991 --> 02:46:27,400
like very close to the fight, whether
a week or so out. What did you do?

2951
02:46:27,490 --> 02:46:28,311
You went well,

2952
02:46:28,311 --> 02:46:32,330
I heard that happened in any went to
Miami to finish the rest of his camp after

2953
02:46:32,331 --> 02:46:33,164
that. Really?

2954
02:46:33,290 --> 02:46:37,790
So that's what I think his
dad was bitching about.

2955
02:46:37,970 --> 02:46:40,640
Like Joshua, I'm not a
hundred percent certain,

2956
02:46:40,641 --> 02:46:43,430
but his in the ring when they
was getting into it and you just,

2957
02:46:43,431 --> 02:46:46,460
like I told you he wasn't right
for the fight. He wasn't, you know,

2958
02:46:46,461 --> 02:46:49,700
they were supposed to, they was
trying to reschedule the fight. Yeah,

2959
02:46:49,730 --> 02:46:50,900
they probably should have.

2960
02:46:51,020 --> 02:46:53,330
They probably when you get
dropped like that and Tracy high,

2961
02:46:53,640 --> 02:46:56,390
like the punches he got hit with,
they don't seem like punches at wick.

2962
02:46:56,690 --> 02:47:00,370
He also looked a little out of it, out
of it. It's easy to say that the now.

2963
02:47:00,610 --> 02:47:03,830
Yeah, but Andy releases a
bad mother fucker. Dude,

2964
02:47:03,980 --> 02:47:08,630
that guy throws combinations, man.
Andy Ruiz is a bad motherfucker.

2965
02:47:08,780 --> 02:47:10,910
You know, people just get confused
and they look at that belly.

2966
02:47:11,270 --> 02:47:14,750
If you took all that fat away and you
saw what was underneath it and he fought

2967
02:47:14,751 --> 02:47:17,390
the same way, but he weighed
two 20 and you'd go, wow,

2968
02:47:17,391 --> 02:47:21,050
he's got a receipt on Instagram videos.
I'm training how fast his hands is.

2969
02:47:21,051 --> 02:47:25,100
I'm like, fuck confusing. Listen, when I,

2970
02:47:25,160 --> 02:47:26,810
when they told me to film him,

2971
02:47:26,990 --> 02:47:31,990
I think he might've had 20,000 subscribes
on 20,000 followers and then in one

2972
02:47:33,411 --> 02:47:37,670
night he had like a million. I'm like,

2973
02:47:37,700 --> 02:47:40,340
golly, like, and he
seemed like a humble guy.

2974
02:47:40,370 --> 02:47:42,470
He keep like trying to promote snickers,

2975
02:47:42,770 --> 02:47:46,040
snickers like every day snickers
snick he wanted that sponsorship.

2976
02:47:46,070 --> 02:47:49,910
Snickers need to give him the sponsors.
He likes snickers. He's a big boy.

2977
02:47:50,420 --> 02:47:54,410
He's a big boy. Like what
do you think happens?

2978
02:47:54,550 --> 02:47:59,330
You're going to do a rematch. And uh,
yesterday, yesterday, Ruiz Jr said,

2979
02:48:00,320 --> 02:48:04,400
uh, I'm a beat him worse cause I'm
gonna be in better shape. He can't box.

2980
02:48:04,880 --> 02:48:09,620
And I was like, hmm, whoa. He, he was
an Olympic gold medalist. He can fight,

2981
02:48:09,650 --> 02:48:12,800
he can fight, he can fight
him bucks. He goes, I just, I,

2982
02:48:12,950 --> 02:48:14,990
it sucks cause I was gonna
cover big baby Miller.

2983
02:48:16,040 --> 02:48:20,210
I think he's fucked if he fights
Deontay I think Joshua just can't,

2984
02:48:20,330 --> 02:48:22,970
he can't hold up under
that firepower. Nah.

2985
02:48:23,500 --> 02:48:28,500
Deontay hits people and it's like he's
got some fucking mortal Kombat super

2986
02:48:28,790 --> 02:48:31,000
power in his glove. It's crazy. Yeah,

2987
02:48:31,310 --> 02:48:36,310
he got that old slave genetics but
he's got that Tommy Hearns frame too.

2988
02:48:36,770 --> 02:48:40,310
It's like a giant Tommy Hearns.
Where's all that leverage? All that.

2989
02:48:40,900 --> 02:48:44,390
All that torque he hit so God damn hard.

2990
02:48:44,630 --> 02:48:48,200
When you look at a guy that has,
what does he have? Like 40 wins,

2991
02:48:48,230 --> 02:48:52,230
39 Kaos it's something like that
41 wins. 40 KLS or something crazy.

2992
02:48:52,550 --> 02:48:55,790
The only one he didn't Kao is, as we
talked about before was Tyson fury.

2993
02:48:55,850 --> 02:48:57,080
But if you looked at the count,

2994
02:48:57,290 --> 02:49:02,290
if you had a real clock and you hit
stop or you hit start when he went down,

2995
02:49:02,451 --> 02:49:05,090
instead of relying on the
referee to go one and two,

2996
02:49:05,540 --> 02:49:07,040
maybe Tyson would have gotten up.

2997
02:49:07,200 --> 02:49:10,230
You would've known that it was eight
when it was eight to go with the reverie

2998
02:49:10,231 --> 02:49:15,000
was saying eight it was already
10 you know it was like one, two.

2999
02:49:15,090 --> 02:49:18,090
By the time he got to eight
and nine and in Tyson sit up,

3000
02:49:18,500 --> 02:49:22,030
10 had long been passed.
So technically. Yeah,

3001
02:49:22,110 --> 02:49:25,230
but that was also the case with Buster
Douglas and Mike Tyson, you know? Yeah.

3002
02:49:25,290 --> 02:49:28,080
I talked when Mike Tyson
knocked down buster Douglas.

3003
02:49:28,230 --> 02:49:30,790
Buster dogs did not get
up by the count of 10 no,

3004
02:49:30,920 --> 02:49:33,600
I had a real count of 10
and actual ten second count,

3005
02:49:33,750 --> 02:49:37,380
but its obligation is to get up by
the referees count, not by a clock.

3006
02:49:37,880 --> 02:49:40,770
This year's a fucking clock. Why don't
they use a god damn clock? Early on,

3007
02:49:40,771 --> 02:49:42,640
I used to document a Tyson's trainer,

3008
02:49:43,590 --> 02:49:46,890
Stacey McKinley after he got
out of prison and he was,

3009
02:49:46,980 --> 02:49:49,800
I used to always bring that up
with holy filled and him like,

3010
02:49:50,040 --> 02:49:51,900
but he was down 10 seconds.
He was, I don't mean shit.

3011
02:49:52,230 --> 02:49:55,770
They ain't nobody caring about that.
Like they, they don't use that as excuse.

3012
02:49:55,800 --> 02:49:59,550
Like he was true because he could have
gotten up at eight or nine if they,

3013
02:49:59,640 --> 02:50:01,410
they actually have a real clock. Yeah.

3014
02:50:01,800 --> 02:50:05,130
It's not like he was out cold and he
woke up at eight you know, he was,

3015
02:50:05,131 --> 02:50:08,700
he was just gathering his thoughts
and trying to get his brain straight.

3016
02:50:09,750 --> 02:50:12,120
Imagining if an MMA, if
they had standing eight,

3017
02:50:12,480 --> 02:50:14,820
why the fuck doesn't boxing have a clock?

3018
02:50:15,150 --> 02:50:17,660
Like would they have a clock
when it counts the ring, right?

3019
02:50:17,670 --> 02:50:22,050
The ring time swing around so soon as
somebody fall have a fucking real clock

3020
02:50:22,051 --> 02:50:26,290
that shows seven, eight not so you don't
leave it up to the Goddamn in a wreck.

3021
02:50:26,320 --> 02:50:29,430
You look in the corner and say, oh,
that's it. And he pick it up from there.

3022
02:50:29,930 --> 02:50:33,480
The rest, I mean we shouldn't be the
ref counting. It should be like a voice,

3023
02:50:33,540 --> 02:50:36,450
like a digital voice. One, two,

3024
02:50:36,720 --> 02:50:39,630
three like so it's a
hundred percent 10 seconds.

3025
02:50:40,020 --> 02:50:42,540
That's so crazy because one
guy can have a fast count.

3026
02:50:42,541 --> 02:50:43,800
One guy can have a slow count.

3027
02:50:44,010 --> 02:50:46,430
That's still one guy could
have an envelope in his back,

3028
02:50:46,700 --> 02:50:51,570
his suit coat pocket in a locker room.
Just make it a little bit slower. Yeah,

3029
02:50:52,500 --> 02:50:54,040
so you just never know.

3030
02:50:54,390 --> 02:50:56,730
I looked this up when we were talking
about this a couple months ago,

3031
02:50:57,060 --> 02:50:57,781
supposedly,

3032
02:50:57,781 --> 02:51:00,990
that they're the time officials supposed
to start the count immediately and then

3033
02:51:00,991 --> 02:51:04,350
the era and ring referee picks
it up once he's got a attention.

3034
02:51:04,470 --> 02:51:08,430
That is what happens. The problem is the
referee does not do it to 10 seconds.

3035
02:51:08,790 --> 02:51:11,220
He doesn't do it to
actual do an actual clock.

3036
02:51:11,280 --> 02:51:14,790
That's what happens when the guy goes
down and says go to a neutral corner and

3037
02:51:14,791 --> 02:51:19,791
then he picks it up at three full be
off by two seconds easily like a golf

3038
02:51:22,010 --> 02:51:22,830
celebrate men and he like,

3039
02:51:22,830 --> 02:51:25,170
he spent four seconds trying
to get them towards corner,

3040
02:51:25,570 --> 02:51:28,140
but that's on the guy that's
on the guy. That makes sense.

3041
02:51:28,230 --> 02:51:30,840
But you once a guy goes to neutral corner,

3042
02:51:31,320 --> 02:51:35,850
the fucking clock should be like
a legitimate second clock. Yeah,

3043
02:51:36,300 --> 02:51:37,830
yeah. That's crazy.

3044
02:51:38,040 --> 02:51:41,790
Or You flatlined people like water
and then they don't get up. Yeah,

3045
02:51:42,050 --> 02:51:43,320
it comes from a gentleman's rule,

3046
02:51:43,321 --> 02:51:45,450
so I don't know if it was
supposed to be 10 seconds.

3047
02:51:45,740 --> 02:51:49,080
So it's parked in your horse in front of
the fucking ceiling on get outta here.

3048
02:51:49,110 --> 02:51:52,170
It's 2019 we got clocks,
bitch. This is ridiculous.

3049
02:51:52,410 --> 02:51:55,380
It doesn't make any sense in a
shady, but boxing shady as fuck.

3050
02:51:55,381 --> 02:51:58,770
One thing I like what glory does
though, they incorporate five judges.

3051
02:51:58,890 --> 02:52:01,410
These five jewels. I think the
UFC should do that as well.

3052
02:52:01,440 --> 02:52:04,380
I think three judges is ridiculous.
When you see bad decisions,

3053
02:52:04,650 --> 02:52:06,040
it's a lot like a, I don't know who

3054
02:52:06,040 --> 02:52:08,050
the lady Angela Hill just fought against.

3055
02:52:08,230 --> 02:52:11,380
I thought it was a bad decision and
I looked at that. I'm just like,

3056
02:52:12,880 --> 02:52:14,080
why don't they have five judges,

3057
02:52:14,140 --> 02:52:17,980
five judges who know and have five judges
who know what the fuck they're doing.

3058
02:52:18,310 --> 02:52:22,450
But you said it was even like they
named one 70 welterweight. Yeah.

3059
02:52:22,580 --> 02:52:26,440
What they want to do. Well, boxing
uses three judges too. It's, it's,

3060
02:52:26,620 --> 02:52:28,150
I don't know, more than the better.

3061
02:52:28,240 --> 02:52:31,210
It's not like it's expensive to have a
lot of judges because remember that score

3062
02:52:31,210 --> 02:52:35,680
, that score card they
gave to the draw to Canelo?

3063
02:52:35,740 --> 02:52:38,650
Yes. Tim Bradley. No. Yeah.

3064
02:52:38,690 --> 02:52:43,580
Tim Bradley and the one no Mayweather.
Kale. Yes. Yeah. That lady, she,

3065
02:52:43,770 --> 02:52:46,060
she'd vanished and then she
did it again, right? Yeah,

3066
02:52:46,061 --> 02:52:48,720
she did it again with Tim Bradley
and many pack. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3067
02:52:48,820 --> 02:52:51,970
When Tim Bradley beat Manny
Pacquiao, everybody was like, what?

3068
02:52:53,710 --> 02:52:56,920
Even Bradley knew he didn't win that
fight. No, he didn't win that fight,

3069
02:52:56,921 --> 02:53:00,660
but the Canelo one was ridiculous.
That was crazy that to draw, she was,

3070
02:53:00,670 --> 02:53:04,720
that's one of those weird things where
it's like all someone has to do was put a

3071
02:53:04,721 --> 02:53:07,480
shit load of money on a majority decision,

3072
02:53:07,720 --> 02:53:10,330
so like you know that Floyd's
not going to knock Canelo out.

3073
02:53:10,360 --> 02:53:13,030
He doesn't really knock
him, but he's going to win.

3074
02:53:13,250 --> 02:53:16,870
I put the money on a majority decision
means one person has to be dirty.

3075
02:53:17,140 --> 02:53:19,930
All you need is one person who
is dirty. You can win millions.

3076
02:53:22,150 --> 02:53:26,290
Boxing is so dirty. It's so old.
You can be dirty. UFC No, right.

3077
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:31,420
Really the judging, I don't think,
I think the judging is incompetent.

3078
02:53:31,570 --> 02:53:34,060
I don't believe it. I've
never had any indication.

3079
02:53:34,061 --> 02:53:35,830
No one's ever said to me
they think it's dirty.

3080
02:53:36,340 --> 02:53:39,670
I think it's incompetent and competent.
There's a lot of incompetent judges,

3081
02:53:39,730 --> 02:53:43,330
but then it's also we got state judges.
It'd be weird with the rest. Sometimes.

3082
02:53:43,331 --> 02:53:45,310
I see. I was like, who is this ref? Well,

3083
02:53:45,311 --> 02:53:47,650
like we were talking about with
Kamara Rosemont and Damien Maia.

3084
02:53:47,651 --> 02:53:50,380
That's a ridiculous thing to separate
those two. That's ridiculous.

3085
02:53:50,381 --> 02:53:52,870
Let them play it out. Also,
you've got a constrictor,

3086
02:53:53,110 --> 02:53:56,920
you've got a guy who's whole deal is to
get you in a bad position and then he

3087
02:53:56,921 --> 02:53:59,350
gets you in a bad position
and he's working his way.

3088
02:53:59,351 --> 02:54:02,420
He's trying to work his way. He's
got one hook and he's got your back.

3089
02:54:02,500 --> 02:54:06,520
He was Tom left to that. It's time
left. It's time break. Break, break.

3090
02:54:06,850 --> 02:54:10,060
Fucking break you break. Are you crazy?

3091
02:54:10,330 --> 02:54:13,540
What the fuck are you here for? What
are you here for? You? Just one rock.

3092
02:54:13,541 --> 02:54:16,780
'Em sock. 'Em robots. You'd go watch
bare knuckle boxing. Get out of here.

3093
02:54:16,781 --> 02:54:19,450
But I just rewatched the Ashker in a rob.

3094
02:54:19,510 --> 02:54:23,320
I think they could've stopped it when
he'd slammed on me. He could've, could've,

3095
02:54:23,450 --> 02:54:26,830
could've stopped it. Could've stopped
it when he was fucking run in his face.

3096
02:54:27,870 --> 02:54:30,940
Oh, could've stopped it. But
that was a lot of time left. Yup.

3097
02:54:30,970 --> 02:54:33,930
Could've style was in the locker room
where Robin when he came back could have

3098
02:54:33,931 --> 02:54:37,060
stopped it. But I wanna
watch that with herb.

3099
02:54:37,300 --> 02:54:39,820
Dean had herb in here and we watched
it and herb changed my mind cause I was

3100
02:54:39,821 --> 02:54:42,810
thinking that he wasn't
out cause you know,

3101
02:54:42,890 --> 02:54:46,990
it's like they got to run that back and
in Camarillo was saying they got to run

3102
02:54:46,991 --> 02:54:51,820
that back. That, that he was out or that
he wasn't out with the arm drop. Yeah.

3103
02:54:51,850 --> 02:54:54,490
But then I watched it with her but
he's like, this is not a normal way.

3104
02:54:54,491 --> 02:54:56,570
Your arm drops. I'm like,
you're right, your eyes.

3105
02:54:56,740 --> 02:54:59,710
So he could've just been out for a second
if he was out for a second and just

3106
02:54:59,890 --> 02:55:03,980
woke back up. Yeah. Pop back up. And
the way ask her and said it is when herb

3107
02:55:03,980 --> 02:55:07,160
started coming over to him, he knew he
was out. Herb started coming over to him.

3108
02:55:07,161 --> 02:55:10,230
He let up on the grip a little bit
and that's why Robbie poppy gang up

3109
02:55:10,350 --> 02:55:14,480
consciousness. Yeah. I believe Ben,
I believe Ben and I, the arm that is,

3110
02:55:14,510 --> 02:55:17,480
you don't let your arm just drop
like that. I think he was out for it.

3111
02:55:17,481 --> 02:55:20,270
So soon as he picked his arm up,
he woke back up cause he was like,

3112
02:55:20,330 --> 02:55:24,260
I think thumbs up. Ben Clamped on
his head, van squeezing his head,

3113
02:55:24,440 --> 02:55:27,560
the arm drops, herb
comes over, look at him.

3114
02:55:27,890 --> 02:55:29,180
He thinks he's going to stop the fight.

3115
02:55:29,181 --> 02:55:31,370
He lets up a little bit because
he thinks he's already out.

3116
02:55:31,790 --> 02:55:34,550
And then he pops back up to life and
then herb subs to find rob. He's like,

3117
02:55:34,551 --> 02:55:36,340
what the fuck? I think that's what it,

3118
02:55:36,341 --> 02:55:38,630
that's one of the most
confuses back and forth.

3119
02:55:38,690 --> 02:55:43,340
Even during the fight I watched the
you and a dominant now he was, no, no,

3120
02:55:43,341 --> 02:55:46,820
he was, oh no, he's not. Yeah,
I believe you're right there.

3121
02:55:47,490 --> 02:55:49,910
Well you're also looking
through this cage, right?

3122
02:55:49,980 --> 02:55:53,270
It's over there and we're like, what is
happening? He's out. He's out. He's out.

3123
02:55:53,670 --> 02:55:57,220
Oh, he's not out. Herb was in a bad
anger. He was in, he was in a bad,

3124
02:55:57,380 --> 02:56:00,050
and he's the gold standard
though. Truth, the best.

3125
02:56:00,230 --> 02:56:03,920
And he's so calm about how he
handles things. Never emotional.

3126
02:56:04,160 --> 02:56:07,220
Always logical. You Know Zoe,
where he breaks things down.

3127
02:56:07,580 --> 02:56:08,690
He's the gold standard.

3128
02:56:08,691 --> 02:56:10,880
Especially now that John
McCarthy's not an intern anymore.

3129
02:56:11,410 --> 02:56:13,760
He's doing a great job
at Bella Torta. Yeah,

3130
02:56:13,820 --> 02:56:16,940
I mean look belt belt or he used to be,

3131
02:56:17,060 --> 02:56:20,450
that was like a clear difference between
the UFC and belt. None anymore man.

3132
02:56:20,860 --> 02:56:25,650
So you know I failed Lovato
and Musashi. You see that man,

3133
02:56:26,020 --> 02:56:30,090
I level fucking fight mass
crazy. Especially after
Musashi beat Roy McDonald,

3134
02:56:30,230 --> 02:56:33,200
which Rory probably shouldn't have
been fighting him at 185 pounds.

3135
02:56:33,201 --> 02:56:34,034
It was a wrong way.

3136
02:56:34,340 --> 02:56:37,460
Class massage is way bigger than
him and with saucy is beaten guys.

3137
02:56:37,730 --> 02:56:42,730
Real top flight guys at two Oh five
and then you know you got Lima who just

3138
02:56:42,861 --> 02:56:46,160
knocked out Michael Van and page
Moodle. No promotion on him.

3139
02:56:46,590 --> 02:56:47,900
And I was sitting there like, man,

3140
02:56:47,901 --> 02:56:51,770
I wish I could've just got my hands
on and told this guy story. Yeah.

3141
02:56:51,920 --> 02:56:55,250
Cause nobody knew him. Liam as
a murderer bro. He's a murderer.

3142
02:56:55,300 --> 02:56:58,430
His brother in the UFC,
right? Yep. Yeah, yeah. Diego.

3143
02:56:58,580 --> 02:57:02,390
But Douglas is as good as
anybody alive at 170 pounds.

3144
02:57:02,391 --> 02:57:05,330
I really believe that ash crazy man.

3145
02:57:05,331 --> 02:57:08,570
I like it being called champion and
Scott Coker doing. Yep, I do too.

3146
02:57:08,780 --> 02:57:11,270
I wished that they would do the same
thing that one is doing with the weight

3147
02:57:11,271 --> 02:57:14,330
cuts. Cut All that way. Cut
Bullshit out. Just stop it.

3148
02:57:14,331 --> 02:57:16,640
That's not necessarily Michael.
Shannon cut a lot of weight though.

3149
02:57:17,540 --> 02:57:21,740
He a big boy. So when he got hit
heavy that's, I always like when they,

3150
02:57:21,800 --> 02:57:22,970
when I see him get hit like that,

3151
02:57:22,971 --> 02:57:25,730
I see how much weight these guys
cut cause I'm around it. Yeah.

3152
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:28,520
And I'm like damn. He didn't
really get hit like that.

3153
02:57:28,550 --> 02:57:31,010
He got hit on the temple though,
right? He got hit the ball,

3154
02:57:31,011 --> 02:57:35,000
hit him on pit bull, hit him on the
temple. It's hard. They both hit hard.

3155
02:57:35,030 --> 02:57:38,870
It's one of those crazy games where you
know whoever connects first can put the

3156
02:57:38,871 --> 02:57:41,990
other guy out. Especially after
channeling knocked out his brother.

3157
02:57:42,340 --> 02:57:46,370
It was a big deal. Yeah.
That was a double champion.

3158
02:57:46,390 --> 02:57:49,090
A lot of double champions
now. Honor started it. Yup.

3159
02:57:49,160 --> 02:57:53,570
You got Bader heated double champion.
You got pit bull. Yup. You got Saludo.

3160
02:57:54,020 --> 02:57:58,910
Yup. Dude. Amanda noon to Yup.
So lot. Yeah. Kind of obviously.

3161
02:57:59,390 --> 02:58:01,700
Yeah, Daniel Cormier corny. Yeah.

3162
02:58:02,460 --> 02:58:05,450
Crazy. It's crazy now. He
threatened it to be true.

3163
02:58:05,850 --> 02:58:09,690
I would say if because they gonna have
to do if who, so Hutto is out for a year.

3164
02:58:09,790 --> 02:58:11,790
They going to have to do
an interim at bantamweight.

3165
02:58:12,210 --> 02:58:17,040
So who you do Aljamain and Peter Yon.
You could do that. That's a good fight.

3166
02:58:17,200 --> 02:58:20,160
Yeah. That's a very good where, where
does Cody Garbrandt fit in that picture?

3167
02:58:20,550 --> 02:58:23,640
That's a good question. I think Cody has
to win one. Just get in a fight fight.

3168
02:58:23,850 --> 02:58:28,250
He got knocked out twice in a row.
Pedro, Pedro Munoz, and you know,

3169
02:58:28,290 --> 02:58:31,830
obviously the TJ Dillashaw one comes
into question now the TJ gets popped for

3170
02:58:31,831 --> 02:58:35,270
EPO, but what did he say on
Shale? Sonnen's podcasts took,

3171
02:58:35,520 --> 02:58:38,130
he had an explanation, the chicken,
because he's trying to make the way,

3172
02:58:38,550 --> 02:58:41,340
he must've been just so drained trying
to make that weight. You really do have,

3173
02:58:41,341 --> 02:58:43,740
I like TJ too, man. I do too. Sad.

3174
02:58:44,370 --> 02:58:46,920
I was supposed to fill on a week
before he lost it. So who though?

3175
02:58:46,921 --> 02:58:50,190
And then he was just like, ah,
let's just do the next camp.

3176
02:58:50,700 --> 02:58:53,580
He looked like a goddamn
skeleton going into that fight.

3177
02:58:53,910 --> 02:58:57,660
The pitcher when he, all those
pills was on the table. Yeah,

3178
02:58:58,140 --> 02:59:02,550
it was like 500 bottles. I was like,
why would you just to maintain his body,

3179
02:59:02,551 --> 02:59:06,220
keep it alive or he's just basically
draining all the life out of it to make to

3180
02:59:06,990 --> 02:59:10,680
125 pounds. He's owning up to it
though. Yeah. He didn't like that.

3181
02:59:10,860 --> 02:59:14,700
You gotta face show. True. Sometimes. He
also had a really fucked up shoulders.

3182
02:59:14,701 --> 02:59:18,000
Both shoulders are fucked up and he
wound up getting surgery on one of them,

3183
02:59:18,140 --> 02:59:19,890
you know? And he had the video.

3184
02:59:19,891 --> 02:59:23,790
He was fat looking and with the mustache
I was like, what the hell is going on?

3185
02:59:23,790 --> 02:59:27,880
Did he just go to get kidnapped by
aliens and dropped back off? Well,

3186
02:59:27,930 --> 02:59:32,160
when you lose that much weight, your
body wants to hold your body essentially.

3187
02:59:32,161 --> 02:59:35,310
You wanted to starvation mode and your
body wants to hold on to every fucking

3188
02:59:35,311 --> 02:59:37,710
calorie it can. It slows
your metabolism down.

3189
02:59:37,711 --> 02:59:41,310
I just think you're doing
a giant to service for the
rest of your life with your

3190
02:59:41,311 --> 02:59:43,530
body when you do that. I
think it's very unhealthy.

3191
02:59:43,560 --> 02:59:47,850
Brutal cuts take years off your life.
That's what a lot of fighters say, man.

3192
02:59:47,851 --> 02:59:51,860
It's a Shawn Soriano.
There's eight hard knocks.

3193
02:59:51,890 --> 02:59:55,380
A three 65. I remember when whose mom
was getting ready for the willy fight.

3194
02:59:56,400 --> 03:00:00,150
That's my favorite time to film during
fight week cause that's the true raw

3195
03:00:00,151 --> 03:00:03,090
emotions is the weight cut.
Everything else is standard.

3196
03:00:03,091 --> 03:00:07,530
They gotta do open workouts, media,
it's barn stuff. But that weight cut,

3197
03:00:07,560 --> 03:00:12,280
you see these people, souls
and Guzman in there. Uh,

3198
03:00:13,020 --> 03:00:15,540
Ben Ashker and they all in a
pit all cutting weight together.

3199
03:00:15,541 --> 03:00:16,950
I'm just thinking like this is crazy.

3200
03:00:17,250 --> 03:00:21,060
And you've seen the picture with a cowboy
and Tony Ferguson when they was side

3201
03:00:21,061 --> 03:00:23,480
by side cutting weight.
That's when neighbors,

3202
03:00:23,630 --> 03:00:27,150
they have respect goes to the all time
high with the fighters cause they all in,

3203
03:00:27,270 --> 03:00:31,020
they're trying to feed their families.
Man is showing when money. Dude,

3204
03:00:31,021 --> 03:00:34,050
Tony Ferguson scares the fuck out
of me. That guy don't get tired.

3205
03:00:34,680 --> 03:00:37,200
He doesn't get tired. Could
be respect him. Fights him,

3206
03:00:37,201 --> 03:00:41,190
looks like they got run through a
fucking meal. Break hands, right bricks.

3207
03:00:41,340 --> 03:00:44,070
What the hell is he doing? Punching.
And you've got big ass hands,

3208
03:00:44,220 --> 03:00:46,440
fire everyday and he has big wide hands.

3209
03:00:46,441 --> 03:00:48,930
So many people have been
screaming for me to please do it.

3210
03:00:48,980 --> 03:00:51,840
An anatomy of Tony Ferguson.
He's so interesting too.

3211
03:00:51,900 --> 03:00:53,670
That's what I'm situations
where it's like,

3212
03:00:55,470 --> 03:00:58,470
I got to see the how. I
don't know man. It's weird.

3213
03:00:58,500 --> 03:01:02,320
I'm in a weird position because
like for example, I like Connor,

3214
03:01:03,100 --> 03:01:06,880
but damn, that relationship you got
with Kobi was horrible. I can't, yeah,

3215
03:01:07,120 --> 03:01:11,230
I understand. It just sucks
because the Connor team,

3216
03:01:11,231 --> 03:01:14,960
before I ever met Khabib, I was on Roddy.
All these guys on the channel, right?

3217
03:01:14,961 --> 03:01:17,620
Yeah. And now I'm team could be, you know,

3218
03:01:17,621 --> 03:01:21,400
when you get invited to somebody's
country, be around a family,

3219
03:01:21,550 --> 03:01:26,200
eat the food with their brothers, they
sacred. Yeah. Like you gotta respect it.

3220
03:01:26,370 --> 03:01:30,040
So I respect it. Tony Ferguson's a
different one. They talk shit. But I,

3221
03:01:30,110 --> 03:01:32,200
I would love to get Tony
Ferguson on the channel.

3222
03:01:32,230 --> 03:01:35,290
Do you think that compromises
your objectivity or do
you think that's just the

3223
03:01:35,291 --> 03:01:37,330
price that you pay to
be that close? I know.

3224
03:01:37,600 --> 03:01:39,370
I think this the price you pay sometimes,

3225
03:01:39,371 --> 03:01:43,150
but I ho I wish fighters will
understand what I'm trying to do.

3226
03:01:43,600 --> 03:01:46,180
I'm trying to build. I think they do
and they definitely will now. Yeah.

3227
03:01:46,330 --> 03:01:48,520
I'm trying to build a
platform from all fighters.

3228
03:01:48,521 --> 03:01:52,390
I don't care if y'all fighting it get
ugly. You throw a Dolly through a bus,

3229
03:01:52,391 --> 03:01:56,410
you talk about somebody's family and
all this stuff. I get that, ah man,

3230
03:01:56,411 --> 03:01:57,280
I can't touch that.

3231
03:01:57,760 --> 03:02:00,610
But when it comes to like somebody
like Tony Ferguson versus cubby,

3232
03:02:01,000 --> 03:02:06,000
I want to have the access to go with
Tony and Eddie and film that and talk to

3233
03:02:06,761 --> 03:02:09,520
them and get inside the
mindset of who Tony Is.

3234
03:02:10,330 --> 03:02:12,280
No one has really promoted Tony Ferguson.

3235
03:02:12,490 --> 03:02:16,330
I feel like I could do an amazing job
spending a day or two with Tony Ferguson

3236
03:02:16,331 --> 03:02:18,250
and talking about life
and I think you could too,

3237
03:02:18,251 --> 03:02:22,480
but I don't know if Tony be interest
into it. Tony is a real rebel.

3238
03:02:23,320 --> 03:02:26,620
He's a very unique, he may give you a
little bit, but not everything you want.

3239
03:02:27,070 --> 03:02:29,600
Yeah, too. He doesn't want
anybody in close with him.

3240
03:02:29,660 --> 03:02:32,920
He's got secrets too in terms of
how he prepares and how he trains.

3241
03:02:32,980 --> 03:02:37,420
He had one of my good
friends, uh, document them.

3242
03:02:37,421 --> 03:02:40,630
His last fight in Vegas, the one
when he fought Petty's he filmed,

3243
03:02:40,660 --> 03:02:44,740
he documented him the whole whole time.
So he had a camera crew with them. Well,

3244
03:02:44,741 --> 03:02:47,200
I think after his last fight,

3245
03:02:47,230 --> 03:02:49,810
I think people are starting to
understand the cowboy fight,

3246
03:02:50,170 --> 03:02:53,350
the disguise something truly
special. Everybody knew.

3247
03:02:53,351 --> 03:02:55,240
But if you look at is the last time,

3248
03:02:55,241 --> 03:03:00,241
I mean Luke Thomas had something on his
Twitter documenting the last time or how

3249
03:03:01,001 --> 03:03:04,770
crazy it is of you look like who was
champion the last time? Tony I now lost,

3250
03:03:05,170 --> 03:03:08,650
I mean he's a monster. His last
loss was to Michael Johnson. Yeah.

3251
03:03:08,680 --> 03:03:12,160
How long ago was that? Long
time. I think it was 2013.

3252
03:03:12,220 --> 03:03:15,160
That's crazy that Michael Johnson
beat him. He beat Dustin poor ea.

3253
03:03:15,161 --> 03:03:18,070
Michael Johnson man does support
hotline though. At lightweight. Yup.

3254
03:03:18,850 --> 03:03:21,640
Kayla and Edson Barbosa.
Yup. Yup. And his,

3255
03:03:21,760 --> 03:03:25,010
his tough losses was to gay t who
he, he could've beat gates. He,

3256
03:03:25,011 --> 03:03:27,520
he had him beat. They're
both back and forth.

3257
03:03:27,521 --> 03:03:30,490
That was in there could
be fight that I really,

3258
03:03:31,100 --> 03:03:35,550
I mean that's debatable that he stung
them, but soon as they tagged them,

3259
03:03:35,560 --> 03:03:39,690
tagged them. But it wasn't like a, no
flippy hit him. It's a fight. Yeah,

3260
03:03:39,790 --> 03:03:42,310
but it could be mauled him.
It grabbed him and it was,

3261
03:03:43,060 --> 03:03:47,320
it just shows how good could be better.
You have to give up. I deserve this.

3262
03:03:47,560 --> 03:03:49,720
Yeah, give up. That's when I
was like, who the hell is this?

3263
03:03:49,810 --> 03:03:53,020
Don't have to be champion. I didn't
know who could be bus. I was documented.

3264
03:03:53,021 --> 03:03:54,130
Michael Johnson for the camp.

3265
03:03:54,280 --> 03:03:57,230
I know he's telling him to give up boys
beating the fuck. I know I deserve this.

3266
03:03:57,231 --> 03:04:02,120
Right. Like Mike on the bottom and
hit him back by like under. He's like,

3267
03:04:03,200 --> 03:04:05,840
I was about when he was beating the
shit out of [inaudible] let's talk now.

3268
03:04:06,350 --> 03:04:09,020
Let's talk. Boom. He
just beat. So you know I,

3269
03:04:09,021 --> 03:04:13,580
I was backstage when he came back in
the locker room. Yeah. After the Malay.

3270
03:04:14,420 --> 03:04:17,750
People have never seen that for this
yet. What was that like? It was crazy.

3271
03:04:18,830 --> 03:04:19,790
I remember he was like,

3272
03:04:19,980 --> 03:04:23,270
we'll turn the camera off because
it was just too much going on. Yeah.

3273
03:04:23,271 --> 03:04:28,190
I've never released it yet because out
of respect of the courts, so I asked him,

3274
03:04:28,220 --> 03:04:30,220
I showed us a snippet and budgeted.

3275
03:04:30,570 --> 03:04:34,970
I just look there. We
need him to fight again.

3276
03:04:35,000 --> 03:04:38,690
We need to get past all that
nonsense. Yeah. Trust me.

3277
03:04:38,810 --> 03:04:42,500
I can't wait to show the world one day
how crazy that was in the locker around.

3278
03:04:42,501 --> 03:04:46,280
But listen, well, we just did three
hours, man. Whoa. Leave that look.

3279
03:04:46,281 --> 03:04:50,690
It's three 10 do the clock. Crazy.
Same time weapon, this place.

3280
03:04:51,080 --> 03:04:53,600
This was everything I was hoping it
was going to be, man. I appreciate it.

3281
03:04:53,630 --> 03:04:56,900
I appreciate you and I think what you're
doing with your channel is amazing.

3282
03:04:56,901 --> 03:05:00,110
Your documentary is amazing
and I appreciate. Thanks man.

3283
03:05:00,111 --> 03:05:05,000
I appreciate it very much. You fire
everybody. Woo. Fuck three hours.
