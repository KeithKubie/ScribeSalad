To transform a surface normal you need to use the transpose of the inverse of

00:00:03.284 --> 00:00:07.671
the matrix you used to transform the surface itself. Anisotropic filtering is a

00:00:07.671 --> 00:00:10.660
way of improving how a texture map looks by taking additional samples and

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.087
blending them. Skinning is an animation technique that uses bones to define the

00:00:15.087 --> 00:00:19.525
area of influence of the rigid parts of the model. Lambertian reflectance is

00:00:19.525 --> 00:00:24.205
the model used for the diffuse component of the basic illumination model. The

00:00:24.205 --> 00:00:27.725
axis/angle formulation in a quaternion describe the same thing, a rotation

00:00:27.725 --> 00:00:32.494
transform. The vertex shader uses the model-view matrix to transform points in

00:00:32.494 --> 00:00:33.730
view space.
