Episode 41: Rise of Conservatism

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.360
Hi, I’m John Green, this is CrashCourse
U.S. history and today we’re going to--Nixon?--we’re

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.181
going to talk about the rise of conservatism.
So Alabama, where I went to high school, is

00:00:09.181 --> 00:00:14.740
a pretty conservative state and reliably sends
Republicans to Washington. Like, both of its

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.029
Senators, Jeff Sessions and Richard Shelby,
are Republicans. But did you know that Richard

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:25.199
Shelby used to be a Democrat, just like basically
all of Alabama’s Senators since reconstruction?

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.409
And this shift from Democrat to Republican
throughout the South is the result of the

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:33.890
rise in conservative politics in the 1960s
and 1970s that we are going to talk about

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.390
today. And along the way, we get to put Richard
Nixon’s head in a jar.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.670
Stan just informed me that we don’t actually
get to put Richard Nixon’s head in a jar.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.990
It’s just a Futurama joke. And now I’m
sad.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.930
So, you’ll remember from our last episode
that we learned that not everyone in the 1960s

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.590
was a psychedelic rock-listening, war-protesting
hippie. In fact, there was a strong undercurrent

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.670
of conservative thinking that ran throughout
the 1960s, even among young people.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.560
And one aspect of this was the rise of free
market ideology and libertarianism. Like,

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.570
since the 1950s, a majority of Americans had
broadly agreed that “free enterprise”

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.249
was a good thing and should be encouraged
both in the U.S. and abroad.

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:11.789
Mr. Green, Mr. Green, and also in deep space
where no man has gone before?

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:15.689
No, MFTP. You’re thinking of the Starship
Enterprise, not free enterprise.

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.560
And anyway, Me From The Past, have you ever
seen a more aggressively communist television

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.549
program than “The Neutral Zone” from Star
Trek: The Next Generation’s first season?

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.639
I don’t think so.
intro

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:37.090
Alright so, in the 1950s a growing number
of libertarians argued that unregulated capitalism

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.109
and individual autonomy were the essence of
American freedom. And although they were staunchly

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:46.030
anti-communist, their real target was the
regulatory state that had been created by

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.460
the New Deal. You know, social security, and
not being allowed to, you know, choose how

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.289
many pigs you kill, etc.
Other conservatives weren’t libertarians

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:58.189
at all but moral conservatives who were okay
with the rules that enforced traditional notions

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.590
of family and morality. Even if that seemed
like, you know, an oppressive government.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.039
For them virtue was the essence of America.
But both of these strands of conservatism

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.110
were very hostile toward communism and also
to the idea of “big government.”

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.140
And it’s worth noting that since World War
I, the size and scope of the federal government

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.430
had increased dramatically.
And hostility toward the idea of “big government”

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.200
remains the signal feature of contemporary
conservatism. Although very few people actually

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.290
argue for shrinking the government. Because,
you know, that would be very unpopular. People

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.470
like Medicare.
But it was faith in the free market that infused

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.120
the ideology of the most vocal young conservatives
in the 1960s.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.610
They didn’t receive nearly as much press
as their liberal counterparts but these young

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.860
conservatives played a pivotal role in reshaping
the Republican Party, especially in the election

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.500
of 1964.
The 1964 presidential election was important

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.700
in American history precisely because it was
so incredibly uncompetitive.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.820
I mean, Lyndon Johnson was carrying the torch
of a wildly popular American president who

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.130
had been assassinated a few months before.
He was never going to lose.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.320
And indeed he didn’t. The republican candidate,
Arizona senator Barry Goldwater, was demolished

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.120
by LBJ.
But the mere fact of Goldwater’s nomination

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.460
was a huge conservative victory. I mean, he
beat out liberal Republican New York Governor

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.600
Nelson Rockefeller. And yes, there were liberal
Republicans.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.980
Goldwater demanded a harder line in the Cold
War, even suggesting that nuclear war might

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.730
be an option in the fight against communism.
And he lambasted the New Deal liberal welfare

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.710
state for destroying American initiative and
individual liberty. I mean, why bother working

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.630
when you could just enjoy life on the dole?
I mean, unemployment insurance allowed anyone

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.110
in America to become a hundredaire.
But it was his stance on the Cold War that

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.170
doomed his candidacy. In his acceptance speech,
Goldwater famously declared, “Extremism

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.460
in the defense of liberty is no vice.”
Which made it really easy for Johnson to paint

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.630
Goldwater as an extremist.
In the famous “Daisy” advertisement, Johnson’s

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.600
supporters countered Goldwater’s campaign
slogan of “in your heart, you know he’s

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.830
right” with “but in your guts you know
he’s nuts.”

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.730
So in the end, Goldwater received a paltry
27 million votes to Johnson’s 43 million,

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.130
and Democrats racked up huge majorities in
both houses of Congress. This hides, however,

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.700
the significance of the election. Five of
the six states that Goldwater carried were

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.000
in the Deep South, which had been reliably
democratic, known as the “Solid South,”

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.370
in fact.
Now, it’s too simple to say that race alone

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.910
led to the shift from Democratic to the Republican
party in the South because Goldwater didn’t

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.910
really talk much about race.
But the Democrats, especially under LBJ, became

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:35.340
the party associated with defending civil
rights and ending segregation, and that definitely

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.080
played a role in white southerners’ abandoning
the Democrats, as was demonstrated even more

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.810
clearly in the 1968 election.
The election of 1968 was a real cluster-Calhoun,

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.930
I mean, there were riots and there was also
the nomination of Hubert Humphrey, who was

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.980
very unpopular with the anti-war movement,
and also was named Hubert Humphrey, and that’s

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.380
just what happened with the Democrats.
But, lost in that picture was the Republican

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.500
nominee, Richard Milhous Nixon, who was one
of the few candidates in American history

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.810
to come back and win the presidency after
losing in a previous election. How’d he

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.331
do it?
Well, it probably wasn’t his charm, but

00:05:09.331 --> 00:05:15.350
it might have been his patience. Nixon was
famous for his ability to sit and wait in

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.330
poker games. It made him very successful during
his tour of duty in the South Pacific. In

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.200
fact, he earned the nickname “Old Iron Butt.”
Plus, he was anti-communist, but didn’t

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.500
talk a lot about nuking people. And the clincher
was probably that he was from California,

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.110
which by the late 1960s was becoming the most
populous state in the nation.

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.960
Nixon won the election, campaigning as the
candidate of the “silent majority” of

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.389
Americans who weren’t anti-war protesters,
and who didn’t admire free love or the communal

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:43.610
ideals of hippies.
And who were alarmed at the rights that the

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.180
Supreme Court seemed to be expanding, especially
for criminals.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.041
This silent majority felt that the rights
revolution had gone too far. I mean, they

00:05:51.041 --> 00:05:55.540
were concerned about the breakdown in traditional
values and in law and order. Stop me if any

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.919
of this sounds familiar.
Nixon also promised to be tough on crime,

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:02.800
which was coded language to whites in the
south that he wouldn’t support civil rights

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.661
protests. The equation of crime with African
Americans has a long and sordid history in

00:06:07.661 --> 00:06:11.590
the United States, and Nixon played it up
following a “Southern strategy” to further

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:16.000
draw white Democrats who favored segregation
into the Republican ranks.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.169
Now, Nixon only won 43% of the vote, but if
you’ve paid attention to American history,

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:23.220
you know that you ain’t gotta win a majority
to be the president.

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:27.210
He was denied that majority primarily by Alabama
Governor George Wallace, who was running on

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.389
a pro-segregation ticket and won 13% of the
vote.

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:35.860
So 56% of American voters chose candidates
who were either explicitly or quietly against

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.580
civil rights.
Conservatives who voted for Nixon hoping he

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:43.140
would roll back the New Deal were disappointed.
I mean, in some ways the Nixon domestic agenda

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:47.260
was just a continuation of LBJ’s Great Society.
This was partly because Congress was still

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.360
in the hands of Democrats, but also Nixon
didn’t push for conservative programs and

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.050
he didn’t veto new initiatives. Because
they were popular. And he liked to be popular.

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:00.770
So in fact, a number of big government “liberal”
programs began under Nixon. I mean, the environmental

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:04.430
movement achieved success with the enactment
of the Clean Air Act, and the Clean Water

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:08.550
Act, and the Endangered Species Act.
The Occupational Health and Safety Administration

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:12.670
and the National Transportation Safety Board
were created to make new regulations that

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.419
would protect worker safety and make cars
safer.

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:19.139
That’s not government getting out of our
lives, that’s government getting into our

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:20.139
cars.
Now, Nixon did abolish the Office of Economic

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:21.139
Opportunity, but he also indexed social security
benefits to inflation and he proposed the

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:22.139
Family Assistance Plan that would guarantee
a minimum income for all Americans.

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:23.139
And, the Nixon years saw some of the most
aggressive affirmative action in American

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:24.139
history. LBJ had begun the process by requiring
recipients of federal contracts to have specific

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:25.139
numbers of minority employees and timetables
for increasing those numbers.

00:07:25.139 --> 00:07:26.139
But Nixon expanded this with the Philadelphia
plan, which required federal construction

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:27.139
projects to have minority employees. He ended
up attacking this plan after realising that

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:28.139
it was wildly unpopular with trade unions,
which had very few black members, but he had

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:29.139
proposed it.
And when Nixon had the opportunity to nominate

00:07:29.139 --> 00:07:30.139
a new Chief Justice to the Supreme Court after
Earl Warren retired in 1969, his choice, Warren

00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:31.139
Burger was supposed to be a supporter of small
government and conservative ideals, but, just

00:07:31.139 --> 00:07:33.840
like Nixon, he proved a disappointment in
that regard.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:38.419
Like, in Swan v. Charlotte-Mecklenbug Board
of Education, the court upheld a lower court

00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:42.699
ruling that required busing of students to
achieve integration in Charlotte’s schools.

00:07:42.699 --> 00:07:47.139
And then the Burger court made it easier for
minorities to sue for employment discrimination,

00:07:47.139 --> 00:07:52.120
especially with its ruling in Regents of the
University of California v. Bakke. This upheld

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.900
affirmative action as a valid governmental
interest, although it did strike down the

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:59.960
use of strict quotas in university admissions.
Now, many conservatives didn’t like these

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:04.650
affirmative action decisions, but one case
above all others had a profound effect on

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:08.931
American politics: Roe v. Wade.
Roe v. Wade established a woman’s right

00:08:08.931 --> 00:08:13.140
to have an abortion in the first trimester
of a pregnancy as well as a more limited right

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:19.139
as the pregnancy progressed. And that decision
galvanized first Catholics and then Evangelical

00:08:19.139 --> 00:08:21.521
Protestants.
And that ties in nicely with another strand

00:08:21.521 --> 00:08:26.350
in American conservatism that developed in
the 1960s and 1970s. Let’s go to the ThoughtBubble.

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:31.100
Many Americans felt that traditional family
values were deteriorating and looked to conservative

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:35.740
republican candidates to stop that slide.
They were particularly alarmed by the continuing

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:41.029
success of the sexual revolution, as symbolized
by Roe v. Wade and the increasing availability

00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:43.780
of birth control.
Statistics tend to back up the claims that

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:48.460
traditional family values were in decline
in the 1970s. Like, the number of divorces

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:54.490
soared to over one million in 1975 exceeding
the number of first time marriages. The birthrate

00:08:54.490 --> 00:09:00.430
declined with women bearing 1.7 children during
their lifetimes by 1976, less than half the

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:04.770
figure in 1957. Now, of course, many people
would argue that the decline of these traditional

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:09.440
values allowed more freedom for women and
for a lot of terrible marriages to end, but

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.060
that’s neither here nor there.
Some conservatives also complained about the

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:17.700
passage in 1972 of Title IX, which banned
gender discrimination in higher education,

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:21.930
but many more expressed concern about the
increasing number of women in the workforce.

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:27.581
Like, by 1980 40% of women with young children
had been in the workforce, up from 20% in

00:09:27.581 --> 00:09:30.440
1960.
The backlash against increased opportunity

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:35.831
for women is most obviously seen in the defeat
of the Equal Rights Amendment in 1974, although

00:09:35.831 --> 00:09:41.880
it passed Congress easily in 1972. Opponents
of the ERA, which rather innocuously declared

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:46.600
that equality of rights under the law could
not be abridged on account of sex, argued

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:51.380
that the ERA would let men off the hook for
providing for their wives and children, and

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:56.660
that working women would lead to the further
breakdown of the family. Again, all the ERA

00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:01.160
stated was that women and men would have equal
rights under the laws of the United States.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:05.420
But, anyway, some anti-ERA supporters, like
Phyllis Schlafly claimed that free enterprise

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:10.120
was the greatest liberator of women because
the purchase of new labor saving devices would

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:15.000
offer them genuine freedom in their traditional
roles of wife and mother. Essentially, the

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.580
vacuum cleaner shall make you free. And those
arguments were persuasive to enough people

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:23.650
that the ERA was not ratified in the required
¾ of the United States.

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:27.850
Thanks, ThoughtBubble. Sorry if I let my personal
feelings get in the way on that one. Anyway,

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:31.500
Nixon didn’t have much to do with the continuing
sexual revolution; it would have continued

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:34.500
without him because, you know, skoodilypooping
is popular.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:39.710
But, he was successfully reelected in 1972,
partly because his opponent was the democratic

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:43.750
Barry Goldwater, George McGovern.
McGovern only carried one state and it wasn’t

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:47.010
even his home state. It was Massachusetts.
Of course.

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:51.709
But even though they couldn’t possibly lose,
Nixon’s campaign decided to cheat. In June

00:10:51.709 --> 00:10:57.370
of 1972, people from Nixon’s campaign broke
into McGovern’s campaign office, possibly

00:10:57.370 --> 00:10:58.670
to plant bugs. No, Stan, not those kinds of
bugs. Yes. Those.

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:01.980
Now, we don’t know if Nixon actually knew
about the activities of the former employees

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:06.970
of the amazingly acronym-ed CREEP, that is
the Committee for the Reelection of the President.

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:12.040
But this break in at the Watergate hotel eventually
led to Nixon being the first and so far only

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:15.980
American president to resign.
What we do know is this: Nixon was really

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:20.990
paranoid about his opponents, even the ones
who appealed to 12% of American voters, especially

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:25.279
after Daniel Ellsberg leaked the Pentagon
Papers to the New York Times in 1971.

00:11:25.279 --> 00:11:30.790
So, he drew up an enemies list and created
a special investigative unit called the plumbers

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:34.970
whose job was to fix toilets. No, it was to
stop leaks. That makes more sense.

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:38.150
I’m sorry, Stan, it’s just by then the
toilets in the White House were over 100 years

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:40.120
old, I figured they might need some fixing,
but apparently no. Leaking.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.120
Nixon also taped all of the conversations
in the Oval Office and these tapes caused

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.120
a minor constitutional crisis.
So, during the congressional investigation

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.120
of Watergate, it became known that these tapes
existed, so the special prosecutor demanded

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.120
copies.
Nixon refused, claiming executive privilege,

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.120
and the case went all the way to the Supreme
Court, which ruled in U.S. v. Nixon that he

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.120
had to turn them over. And this is important
because it means that the president is not

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.120
above the law.
So, what ultimately doomed Nixon was not the

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.300
break in itself, but the revelations that
he covered it up by authorizing hush money

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:53.470
payments to keep the burglars silent and also
instructing the FBI not to investigate the

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:56.399
crime.
In August of 1974, the House Judiciary Committee

00:11:56.399 --> 00:12:00.710
recommended that articles of impeachment be
drawn up against Nixon for conspiracy and

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:05.430
obstruction of justice. But the real crime,
ultimately, was abuse of power, and there’s

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:09.000
really no question about whether he was guilty
of that. So, Nixon resigned.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:15.130
Aw man, I was thinking I was going to get
away without a Mystery Document today. The

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:17.600
rules here are simple.
I guess the author of the Mystery Document,

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.670
and lately I’m never wrong.
Alright.

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:26.279
Today I am an inquisitor. I believe hyperbole
would not be fictional and would not overstate

00:12:26.279 --> 00:12:31.300
the solemnness that I feel right now. My faith
in the Constitution is whole, it is complete,

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:36.810
it is total. I am not going to sit here and
be an idle spectator to the diminution, the

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:42.061
subversion, the destruction of the Constitution.”
Aw. I’m going to get shocked today.

00:12:42.061 --> 00:12:51.070
Is it Sam Ervin? Aw dang it! Gah!
Apparently it was African American congresswoman

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:54.300
from Texas, Barbara Jordan. Stan, that is
much too hard.

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:57.290
I think you were getting tired of me not being
shocked, Stan, because it’s pretty strange

00:12:57.290 --> 00:13:02.010
to end an episode on conservatism with a quote
from Barbara Jordan, whose election to Congress

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:06.190
has to be seen as a huge victory for liberalism.
But I guess it is symbolic of the very things

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:10.970
that many conservatives found unsettling in
the 1970s, including political and economic

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:15.269
success for African Americans and women, and
the legislation that helped the marginalized.

00:13:15.269 --> 00:13:18.660
I know that sounds very judgmental, but on
the other hand, the federal government had

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:22.170
become a huge part of every American’s life,
maybe too huge.

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:25.370
And certainly conservatives weren’t wrong
when they said that the founding fathers of

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:28.880
the U.S. would hardly recognize the nation
that we had become by the 1970s.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:33.010
In fact, Watergate was followed by a Senate
investigation by the Church Committee, which

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:36.530
revealed that Nixon was hardly the first president
to abuse his power.

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:40.339
The government had spied on Americans throughout
the Cold War and tried to disrupt the Civil

00:13:40.339 --> 00:13:44.820
Rights movement. And the Church Commission,
Watergate, the Pentagon Papers, Vietnam all

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:49.760
of these things revealed a government that
truly was out of control and this undermined

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:54.350
a fundamental liberal belief that government
is a good institution that is supposed to

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:58.019
solve problems and promote freedom.
And for many Conservatives these scandals

00:13:58.019 --> 00:14:02.430
sent a clear signal that government couldn’t
promote freedom and couldn’t solve problems

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:07.730
and that the liberal government of the New
Deal and the Great Society had to be stopped.

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:12.700
Thanks for watching, I’ll see you next week.
