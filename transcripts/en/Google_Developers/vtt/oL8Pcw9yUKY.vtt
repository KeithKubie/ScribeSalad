MARTIN OMANDER: Hello.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.740
My name is Martin
Omander, and I welcome you

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.040
to Google Root Access, the show
featuring actionable startup

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.200
advice.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.090
My guest today is
Mani Doraisamy,

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.370
founder of the
startup Guesswork.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:18.479
Welcome on the show, Mani.

00:00:18.479 --> 00:00:19.895
MANI DORAISAMY:
Thank you, Martin.

00:00:19.895 --> 00:00:23.050
MARTIN OMANDER: So tell me a bit
about your startup, Guesswork.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.410
What do you do?

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.460
MANI DORAISAMY: We are a
machine learning startup

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.110
that helps to qualify leads and
increase customer conversion.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.015
We do that by building
predictive intelligence in CRM.

00:00:33.015 --> 00:00:35.640
MARTIN OMANDER: Predictive
intelligence in CRM.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.330
OK.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.180
How come you decided
to focus on that?

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.730
MANI DORAISAMY: We
found this problem

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.430
that the leads from
internet marketing

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.780
don't convert into
customers very well.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.810
Take this example of
real estate agents.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.250
They get like 100
leads every day.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.250
But out of the 100
leads, 90 of them

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.685
are from internet, from
Trulia, Zillow, and AdWords.

00:00:57.685 --> 00:01:03.060
Only 10 of them are from the
traditional marketing channels.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.630
But the problem is, out of the
90 leads, only five of them

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.530
convert into real customers.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.770
But on the other hand,
if you take the ten leads

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.330
from the traditional channels,
the same five gets converted.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.450
So business owners,
most of the time,

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.640
think that internet marketing
doesn't work very well for them

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.840
and start ignoring those leads.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.500
We found that you could
use machine learning

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.650
and find out which
are the ones that

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.110
are serious inquiries
and casual inquiries,

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.270
and we could surface them on
CRM so that the small business

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.180
owners can focus on
the serious ones rather

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.160
than the casual ones.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.280
MARTIN OMANDER: I see.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.010
So you are taking those 90
and finding the gold in them,

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.260
finding the five there.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.260
MANI DORAISAMY: Exactly.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.510
Yes, that's the one that
increased, doubles the sales.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:50.500
MARTIN OMANDER:
Doubles them, right.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.210
You don't want to
discard the 90,

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.240
but you want to find the five.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.600
So strikes me as a little
bit of trying to find

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.760
the needle in the haystack.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.670
How do you find those
good leads in there?

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.700
MANI DORAISAMY: So when a
new user comes into the CRM,

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.509
we find out the
tone of the inquiry,

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.390
and we find out the
customer's social profile

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.060
and their interests
to figure out

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.930
whether there is a match between
the product that you sell

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.990
and the customer's interest.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.420
But once the customer or the
lead starts engaging with you,

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.120
then you also have a lot more
information about the customer.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.280
Like, for example,
what newsletter

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.220
clicks, what other
newsletter clicks,

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.400
and what's your subsequent
sales inquiries, and so on.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.090
So that gives us a
lot more information

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.310
about how likely he's going
to convert into a customer

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.990
and when he's going to
convert into a customer.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.420
And we accomplish
this by a combination

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.429
of the machine learning
algorithm and a rule engine.

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:48.845
So for machine
learning algorithm,

00:02:48.845 --> 00:02:51.016
we obviously use
Google Prediction API.

00:02:51.016 --> 00:02:53.640
And the rule engine is something
that we have build on our own,

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.640
and that's our [? IP ?].

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.710
MARTIN OMANDER: I see.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.800
So tell me a bit
more about that.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.890
I imagine when a new
customer comes onboard,

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.700
there isn't a lot
of training data

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.700
that the machine learning
algorithm can chew on.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.700
MANI DORAISAMY: Exactly.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.970
MARTIN OMANDER: How do you
deal with that situation?

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.280
MANI DORAISAMY: We
call it a cold start

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.000
problem in the machine
learning world.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.770
I think that's one
significant problem

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.887
that all startups and small
and medium companies face.

00:03:18.887 --> 00:03:20.970
That's one of the reasons
why machine learning has

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.650
been the forte of big
companies like Google.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.520
Because Google has a lot of
data that it has collected

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.560
over time-- be it in search
or be it in Google Maps,

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.466
it's able to predict
how long it will

00:03:32.466 --> 00:03:33.840
take to reach a
particular place,

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.215
because there is so much of
training data for the machine

00:03:36.215 --> 00:03:37.890
learning algorithm
to predict it.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.820
So what we have
done in our case is

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.290
we use a combination
of rule engine

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.340
so that we can predict
without the training data.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.820
Take, for example, the
traditional CRM case.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.530
So if a customer is replying
to your emails consistently,

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.820
then you know the probability
of conversion is more.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.090
You don't have to use machine
learning to actually do

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.480
the text analytics to
find out what is the tone

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.260
or what is the interest.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.360
So during using
the initial stages,

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.890
we use the rule engine to
determine the accuracy.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.200
And once we start getting
training data that's

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.160
good enough to do
the prediction,

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.230
then it seamlessly switches to
the machine learning algorithm.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.040
So it's a kind of handoff
that rule engine does

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.500
to the machine
learning algorithm,

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.804
and all this complexity is
hidden to the consumers.

00:04:26.804 --> 00:04:28.345
MARTIN OMANDER: So
you provide a sort

00:04:28.345 --> 00:04:30.250
of on ramp for the machine
learning algorithm,

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.791
but the customers
don't see anything.

00:04:31.791 --> 00:04:34.700
They just see good
data coming out of it.

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:35.730
MANI DORAISAMY: Exactly.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.610
And I think it's not just
a technology problem.

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.400
Some of these algorithms
work from day one,

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.400
because we focus on a
particular vertical.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.770
We also collect data
about the social profile

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.904
and the interests,
and that gives us

00:04:53.904 --> 00:04:55.820
the accuracy on the
machine learning algorithm

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.910
from day one for
certain algorithms.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:04.430
And that also helps in
getting the algorithm working

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.109
from day one.

00:05:05.109 --> 00:05:06.150
MARTIN OMANDER: Yeah, OK.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.940
So then you have the
deterministic rules engine

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.650
working together with the
probabilistic machine learning.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:14.650
MANI DORAISAMY: Exactly.

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.358
MARTIN OMANDER: So we
have here two types

00:05:16.358 --> 00:05:19.690
of machine intelligence,
if we put it that way.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.306
Is there any place for human
intuition in this equation?

00:05:23.306 --> 00:05:24.180
MANI DORAISAMY: Yeah.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.960
I think human
intuition is something

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.250
that we have been
relying on so long.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.070
For example, if you
look at a sales person,

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.640
he looks at the
tone of the inquiry,

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.000
and he looks at
how many times he

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.960
has called in the last
week, and then his profile,

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.980
and then makes that
human judgment.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.920
You can't completely ignore it.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.200
So what we do is, whenever we
find that the machine learning

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.000
algorithms confidence
score is not that high--

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.240
it's like at 50-50--
then we ask the humans

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.270
to classify whether it is
a serious inquiry or not.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.540
And that becomes a feedback
loop into the machine

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:01.659
learning algorithm.

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:03.450
So it's this combination
of the rule engine

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.430
that gives you the deterministic
algorithm that we have been

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.680
building for so
long and the machine

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.000
learning algorithm that is
coming up to the same speed

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.760
as the deterministic
algorithm, and then

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.040
bringing in that
human intuition, which

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.520
is the triangle
of the algorithms

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.090
that we think will be the future
of how machine learning will

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:23.830
evolve.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.371
Because machine
learning is not going

00:06:25.371 --> 00:06:28.830
to be this puristic,
single play algorithm.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.340
It has to be combined
with the combination

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.920
of deterministic, probabilistic,
and human intuition

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:35.841
to be successful.

00:06:35.841 --> 00:06:38.340
MARTIN OMANDER: And you weave
all of those into your product

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:39.854
and make good data
come out of it.

00:06:39.854 --> 00:06:41.520
MANI DORAISAMY: It's
not just Guesswork.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.187
We think that's how machine
learning will evolve

00:06:44.187 --> 00:06:45.770
in the future as
well, because I think

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:48.260
that makes practical sense
rather than just being

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.410
puristic about the data signs.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.500
MARTIN OMANDER: Right.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.164
So let's get down to
brass tacks, then.

00:06:54.164 --> 00:06:56.080
You've talked about
machine learning and rules

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.920
engine on a fairly high level.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.840
What products or platforms
are you actually using

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.524
to actually make this happen?

00:07:02.524 --> 00:07:04.940
MANI DORAISAMY: So obviously,
we use Google Prediction API

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.750
for the machine
learning algorithm.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:09.910
In fact, from a machine
learning standpoint,

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:11.680
Google Prediction
API is the best

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.690
in the classification algorithm.

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:18.267
And as far as the app itself,
the one that customers

00:07:18.267 --> 00:07:20.100
use to configure machine
learning algorithms

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.560
is concerned, that runs
on Google App Engine.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:28.480
And we run the
rule engine on top

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:32.740
of Google App
Engine and BigData.

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.830
So for cases where you have
to transform customers'

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.160
data into the way the
machine learning requires,

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.360
we use vQuery.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.040
So it does that ETL
job to transform

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.470
customers' data into
machine learning data.

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:47.014
So these are the three products
that we use internally.

00:07:47.014 --> 00:07:47.930
MARTIN OMANDER: Great.

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:50.221
Well, thank you very much
for coming on the show, Mani,

00:07:50.221 --> 00:07:51.763
and sharing your
experiences with us.

00:07:51.763 --> 00:07:53.012
MANI DORAISAMY: Thank, Martin.

00:07:53.012 --> 00:07:53.760
It's my pleasure.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:54.890
MARTIN OMANDER: Thank
you for joining us.

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:55.690
