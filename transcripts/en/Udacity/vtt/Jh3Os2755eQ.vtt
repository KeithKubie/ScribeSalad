00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.340
Now we said earlier,

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.050
the diagnosis is mapping from
data space to hypothesis space.

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.080
We also noted that although we may
start with the initial set of data,

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.780
proposals of specific hypotheses will
lead us to collect additional data.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.000
Once we have some hypotheses for
explaining the available data,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.980
then this hypotheses become
indices into treatment plans.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.410
So the next step is to map the
hypothesis space to the treatment space.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.890
In case of medical diagnosis,
this might be a set of therapies, or

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.350
a set of drugs.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.730
In case of auto mechanics
the treatment space might consist of

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.290
replacement of various parts or
repair of various parts.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.984
Note here in the power
of classification,

00:00:38.984 --> 00:00:44.250
this was the space of percepts,
this was the space of actions,

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.490
this mapping is very complicated.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.339
So we map the space of percepts into the
equal classes in these catergories So

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:55.583
we index the actions over the equal
classes in these catergories so

00:00:55.583 --> 00:00:58.490
the data index the actions
of the data space.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.910
As we exited the treatment,
we monitor it.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.180
And depending upon the result
of this treatment,

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.610
we may need to collect additional data.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.080
The treatment fails.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.230
And the fact that the treatment
has failed is important data

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.460
that might also lead to
the collection of additional data.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.410
Thus in case of auto mechanics,
if I replace a particular component and

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.580
the car still does not
function properly,

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.120
then that is useful data to know.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.310
Because it suggests that the fault that
I thought would explain the malfunction

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.810
is probably not the right diagnosis.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.350
&gt;&gt; We could also think of this last
phase as a type of configuration,

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.880
which we talked about last time.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.880
Given a set of hypotheses
about illnesses or

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.150
faults with a car, we can then
configure a set of treatments or

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.200
repairs that best address
the faults we discovered before.
