Kind: captions
Language: en

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:08.370
Matt&gt;&gt;: All right, so we're gonna spend the
next hour doing site reviews. The week before

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.400
we put up a forum, just on my personal blog,
and did one tweet and said hey, submit your

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.059
sites if you'd like to get your site reviewed.

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:20.509
I was thinking maybe 20, 25 people would sign
up, put their sites up there. We got 500 sites.

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:25.739
So we're gonna send, spend about six seconds
per site [ audience laughs ]. No, not really.

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:30.509
So we went through and I pulled out some fun
ones. And we're just gonna look at them.

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.920
And by the way, all of us are gonna stay around
a little bit afterwards. So if you get, want

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.670
to get like a little bit of one-on-one advice,
stuff like that, we'll all stick around a

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.920
little while. Let me introduce my colleagues.
We have Greg Grothaus who's also on my team,

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.219
Tiffany Lane, also on my team, and Vanessa
Fox former Googler.

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:50.320
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: Not on Matt's team. [ laughter
 ]

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.370
Matt&gt;&gt;: But author of Marketing in the Age
of Google, which is a very good book. Okay,

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.539
so let's go ahead and start jumping into it.
The very first site that we got submitted

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:10.750
was this one. Phoenician Stone, since 1943.
Okay, the main reason I wanted to show this

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.640
site was because so many people submitted,
"Oh tear us down, we're awful, Our SEO's horrible,"

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.640
Right?

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:24.530
This site has no text on it. Okay? It looks
like it has text on it. It has no text. Oh,

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.770
each resurrected piece of, no that's not text.
[Audience laughs] Resonates with over a thousand

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.250
years of humanity in it. No, that's not text.
Where's the text? There's like Phoenician

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.250
Stone and that's it.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.250
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: Yeah, there is text on the page.
It's in the title tag.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.250
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yes, exactly.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.770
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: And he wants to rank for antique
fireplaces.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.770
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yes.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.730
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: And his title tag says Phoenician
Stone.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:49.730
Matt&gt;&gt;: Right. So, so here's the tricky bit.
Literally the only text on this page is in

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:55.110
what are called meta keywords. That's only,
just about the only place that Google doesn't

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.830
index that text. [Audience laughs] Okay?

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.440
We even did a video, because people will tend
to sue each other and say like, "Oh, you copied

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.560
the name of my business. I'm Grecian Stone,
and how dare you put Grecian Stone in my Phoenician

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.560
Stone website."

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.980
And so people get really up in arms about
this. And what we discovered is, believe it

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:18.450
or not, some people will stuff keywords on
a Web page. Hard to believe, I know. I know.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.870
Your eyes will be opened by the end of this
session. And so we don't trust the meta keywords

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:24.870
tag.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.109
Now, if you look at the rest of the text on
this page, you'll find that there is none[Audience

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:35.590
laughter]. All right? So that's, that's a
little bit of a problem. So the simple advice

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.520
is put some text on your page [Audience laughter].
That's, so we'll start out and we'll build

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.520
on that.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.400
First off, you got to have some text on your
page. Now, I'm being a little bit harsh, but

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.889
there's a lot of stuff that this guy can do.
For example, his title tag, as Vanessa mentioned,

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:52.659
is Phoenician Stone.

00:02:52.659 --> 00:03:00.819
If you're looking to buy a, an antique fireplace
or reclaimed biblical stone. Has anybody ever

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:07.299
searched for this stuff? Any of these words?
Antique terracotta jars. Maybe not. No? No,

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.900
no antique. Oh yeah you're, we have one antique
terracotta jar specialist over here. She's

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.139
a real fan.

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:14.719
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: It's her site.

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:20.439
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yeah, it might be her site. [Audience
laughter]Since 1943. So the trick is, we have

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:24.969
a free tool called the Adwords Keyword Tool.
There's a ton of free tools out there. If

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:30.519
you search for keyword tool, just click number
one. You can type in like antique fireplace

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.250
and you'll get related words that people type.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:40.189
So tip number one, put text on your page.
Tip number two, think about what users will

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:45.529
type when searching for your services, and
put those words on the page. Because I guarantee

00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:53.470
you - it's okay, I've pre-labeled everything.
By the way, this, this WiFi is powered by

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.510
Bluetooth, so we have a keyboard over here
and, I, I can't imagine anything would go

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:59.809
wrong with that, right? [Audience laughter]

00:03:59.809 --> 00:04:02.170
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: No, these are loading great right
here.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.170
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yeah.

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.170
&gt;&gt;: Use the other box.

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.959
&gt;&gt;Matt: Yeah, I'll just switch it to the other
box. It's totally fine. [Audience laughter

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:13.489
and clapping] That's why I prelabeled all
my tabs. On the other hand, people did get

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.859
free phones today. So that kind of balances
out. [Audience laughter] That's, use that

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.750
for good, not for evil.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.110
Okay, so I think we've made enough fun of
Phoenician Stone. And, and really there's

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.120
not fun to be made of Phoenician Stone so
much as there's some education here, which

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.250
is number one -- put text on the page. Number
two, think about the words that users are

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.090
really going to type.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:41.150
Okay. Another one, rodsbot.com. First off,
if you just heard the word rodsbot.com, [audience

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:47.610
laughter] what do you think they specialize
in? What kind of a website do you think rodsbot.com

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.751
is? It sounds like robotic sex toys to me.
I don't know.

00:04:50.751 --> 00:04:58.850
But[Audience laughter] in fact rodsbot.com
is weird sites on Google Earth. That's kind

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.590
of cool. In fact, it's kind of addictive.
Twenty hours ago this guy's market worse than

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:09.430
marijuana was. So maybe all the sheriffs are
keeping an eye on this. Here's this face,

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:17.449
evidently it's somewhere in Turkey. Here's
a ghost plane, whoa, Oceanic Flight 814 or

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:18.449
whatever.

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:22.940
So the question is, how do we make this site
rank higher? Well, I'll put the question to

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:28.610
you guys. What, what's wrong with this page?
I'll give you a hint, we, it sort of relates

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.860
to the last site. There's not a lot of text
on this page. And in fact, the person who

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:40.430
asked about it understood that. They said,
"I'm having problems getting text to a content."

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.960
So how do we solve this?

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:44.960
&gt;&gt;: [Inaudible].

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.560
Matt&gt;&gt;: Descriptions, yes. You can write the
content yourself. Now let's do the jujitsu

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.361
where you try to make other people do the
work for you.

00:05:50.361 --> 00:05:51.550
&gt;&gt;: [Inaudible].

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.810
&gt;&gt;Matt: All text. Yes, yes. But you're still
doing the work yourself.

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.470
&gt;&gt;: User reviews and comments.

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:01.699
Matt&gt;&gt;: User reviews and comments, thank you.
User generated content. Why do the work when

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:06.229
you can get someone else to do the work for
you, right? So in some cases all you have

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:10.449
to do is add the ability to add comments,
and people will, they'll show up and they'll

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:11.449
leave the comments for you.

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:15.669
So they'll say, "Whoa, that's a weird face
in Turkey. That plane looks like it's not

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:19.099
even real." And suddenly you'll get all these
sort of keywords and you haven't done the

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:21.270
work. So that's one simple way to do it.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:25.470
So level one of understanding is okay, I'll
type it in. Level two is I'll open it up so

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:31.039
that other people can type it in for me. And
then probably you want to think about throwing

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:34.311
it up on Twitter, Facebook, something like
that. Promote it a little bit.

00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:37.270
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: Yeah, 'cause what are people searching
for where they would get to the site?

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:38.270
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yeah, that's tough.

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:39.990
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: Like he may want to even have a
blog where he talks about-

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.990
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yes.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:45.880
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: -thinks about things that people
are searching for that would care about interesting

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.310
geological phenomenon or something.

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:48.310
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yes.

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:53.780
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: 'Cause I don't think anyone's gonna
be searching for Turkey face. I mean maybe,

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:54.780
I don't know.

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.650
Matt&gt;&gt;: They're probably not gonna search
for Rodsbot either.

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:57.650
&gt;&gt;Vanessa: No.

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:02.280
Matt&gt;&gt;: So, or if they are you don't, they
want something different than what this guy's

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.280
offering.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.069
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: Yeah. I was really disappointed
when I got here [laughs].

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:09.370
Matt&gt;&gt;: It was like I was looking for a different
kind of Rodsbot. So, so yeah, you want to

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:13.120
probably, you can see a little bit of text
down here. And in fact, it's a little weird.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:20.490
As fast as a rods, rodsbot.com. I don't, I
don't think of rods like cheetahs, turtles

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.509
with rockets on them, greased lightning, rods.

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:28.120
I don't think of rods as like whoa, they're
super fast. Oh my gosh. So, and it's not like

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:32.540
the domain is so great that you couldn't come
up with a slightly different domain name or

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:33.819
brand it a little bit differently.

00:07:33.819 --> 00:07:37.300
Now I'm being a little bit rough, but that's
partly because this guy has multiple sites.

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:41.599
He's actually got like five or six sites.
And, and one piece of advice I would like

00:07:41.599 --> 00:07:46.479
to leave you with is if you can put more work
into a single site as opposed to not very

00:07:46.479 --> 00:07:50.060
much work into 50 sites, that can make a really
big difference.

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:54.150
Because sometimes you can build up one really
good site instead of like five or six that

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:57.479
are not quite as finished as they could be.
Does that make sense? Okay.

00:07:57.479 --> 00:07:58.479
&gt;&gt;Vanessa: Matt?

00:07:58.479 --> 00:07:59.479
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yes?

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:03.900
&gt;&gt;Vanessa: What do you think of the friends
page? I can't actually get it to load.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:09.380
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yeah, friends page. I, I believe this
is, a, a couple of these might be his sites.

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:15.000
Yeah. You want to always think about your
linking strategy. These things don't especially

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.290
suit like news websites about Internet TV,
movies and games seen from France. Don't seem

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:23.550
to have a whole lot to do with Google Earth
weird places. On the other hand, weird face

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:30.919
in Turkey. That's kind of cool. Okay, so next
up androidandme.com.

00:08:30.919 --> 00:08:32.169
[pause]

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:39.440
Matt&gt;&gt;: What's the very first thing you notice
whenever you're looking at this page?

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.839
Tiffany&gt;&gt;: Where's the content?

00:08:41.839 --> 00:08:42.839
&gt;&gt;: [Inaudible]

00:08:42.839 --> 00:08:45.680
Matt&gt;&gt;: Grab it. [laughs] Tiffany's saying

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.240
Tiffany&gt;&gt;: Where's the content?

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.240
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yeah.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.240
Tiffany&gt;&gt;: You can't see any content.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:54.200
Matt&gt;&gt;: Right. So on a lot of browsers the
actual content is gonna be below the fold,

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:58.000
right? And that's okay. It's okay to show
a banner ad. That's not the end of the world.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.040
Hey, I hear this is a pretty good product.
It's not bad to show cool things that are

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.440
being shown up.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:07.020
But maybe you don't need this username and
password, maybe you don't need two levels

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:11.220
of these things. Because if you think about
it, if you have to start clicking down below

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.370
to get to the content, not everybody's gonna
click through.

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:19.670
Now let me give a little bit of love. Whenever
you view source, I don't know if you guys

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:26.271
can see it but they are running WordPress
Version 2.9.2. Does anybody know what the

00:09:26.271 --> 00:09:27.491
current version of WordPress is?

00:09:27.491 --> 00:09:28.980
&gt;&gt;: [Inaudible]

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:34.500
Matt&gt;&gt;: At last I checked it was 2.9.2. Now
it may have been updated in the last 36 hours

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:38.250
or something like that. But this means that
they're running the current version of WordPress.

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:43.790
If you run WordPress, and I do and I love
it, you have to keep it up to date.

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:48.930
In fact, I would recommend using an .htaccess
file to whitelist the IP addresses that can

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:53.829
access your wp-admin directory. And not to
harsh on WordPress, because it also applies

00:09:53.829 --> 00:09:58.329
to Drupal, Jumula - Joomla, all this sort
of stuff. If you run a content management

00:09:58.329 --> 00:10:02.590
system which is a stock content management
system, and that's usually a good idea because

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:04.850
it comes built in with relatively good SEO.

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:09.760
WordPress is great as far as SEO goes, but
you have to keep it patched otherwise you'll

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:15.560
get hacked. So by using WordPress, Android
and Me has actually done a fairly good job

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.550
of making sure that SEO is in good shape.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:23.400
For example, look at this particular thing.
Froyo is now officially Android 2.2 (Highlights).

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.470
Right? Good keyword text. It's not spammy,
it's not stuffy and it's right there in the

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:32.560
URL. That also applies in the title. Little
things like URL, keywords in the title and

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:36.389
the URL can make a big difference. And WordPress
is just built to handle that naturally. So

00:10:36.389 --> 00:10:37.720
that's really, really good.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:41.880
Now here's one thing that's kind of strange.
If in Chrome I hover over something I'll see

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:51.130
the title. So the title of Android and Me
is Android and Me. Is that the optimal title?

00:10:51.130 --> 00:11:00.670
No, no. So if you view source on Android and
Me, Android and Me covers all the latest Android

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:04.480
news, phone launches, app reviews, software
updates, Android hacks and phone accessories.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.760
Great. Perfect.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:10.149
Put a little bit of that in the title, right?
And you don't, and you don't want to put all

00:11:10.149 --> 00:11:16.840
of that in the title. But you can say the
latest Android news and reviews, right? Stuff

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.149
like that can make an actual difference on
how stuff ranks.

00:11:20.149 --> 00:11:24.829
So I have to give a little bit of hard time
for the title, just because in most ways Android

00:11:24.829 --> 00:11:27.420
and Me is actually in pretty good shape. And
it was sort of fun because they were like,

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:30.699
"Yeah, beat us up. Give us a hard time." And
I was like, "You know you're actually doing

00:11:30.699 --> 00:11:33.490
pretty well. There's not that much to beat
you up for."

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:39.280
Now one thing I would say is how many people,
just at the drop of a hat, know the difference

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:45.430
between Android and Me, Fandroid, Andronica,
AndroLib, AppBrain. How many people know the

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:49.570
difference between all those? Okay. A lot
more of you actually know the difference between

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:53.221
all of those. But they have the tendency to
blend together a little bit.

00:11:53.221 --> 00:12:00.529
Think about, think about a site like TechCrunch.
M.G. Siegler writes these crazy headlines.

00:12:00.529 --> 00:12:04.930
I can pretty much read a headline and know
M.G. Siegler wrote it. So you want to think

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:08.070
about branding. You want to think about how
can you differentiate yourself. How can I

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:10.269
stand out from the crowd a little bit?

00:12:10.269 --> 00:12:13.920
And if everybody's got Android communities
or Android Central or Android whatever, that's

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:19.000
a little harder to do. Now it's good for people
who are searching for Android, but you don't

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.579
have to have Android in the name of your site.

00:12:20.579 --> 00:12:25.840
Boy Genius Report, people heard of Boy Genius
Report? It's a pretty known mobile site. Nothing

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:29.860
to, it doesn't say mobile phone anywhere in
there. But it's actually a little more brandable

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:34.160
because it stands out from the crowd. It doesn't
just have the same kind of name as everybody

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.160
else.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.699
So when you're thinking about buying a new
domain name, it doesn't have to be Android

00:12:38.699 --> 00:12:43.800
whatever or cheapest car, online rentals,
discounts, stuff like that. It can be something

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:47.570
brandable. So that's something to think about.

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:56.620
Oh, yeah, somebody submitted Google.com. [Audience
laughs]And their comment was, "I would like

00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:04.459
to know the backlinks of it. [Audience laughs].
Ah okay, they want to know the backlinks of

00:13:04.459 --> 00:13:10.250
Google.com. Well luckily I'm prepared. In
one point font I printed out the backlinks

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:16.800
of Google.com. These are the links from all
the sites that begin with AAA.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.160
[Audience laughs]

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:23.399
Matt&gt;&gt;: Now I'm kind, I'm kind of joking,
right? It turns out Adobe and Google and Apple,

00:13:23.399 --> 00:13:28.170
these are some of the most linked to sites
on the Web. But the reason for that is because

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:33.329
they offer something of compelling value.
So again, distinguishing or differentiating

00:13:33.329 --> 00:13:37.510
yourself from the crowd. What can you do that
is so excellent, that is so cool that people

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:38.510
want to link to your site?

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:43.410
Then you get this kind of level of links.
You don't have to fight for each individual

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:45.910
one. You don't, you're not swimming upstream.
You're sort of coasting downhill with the

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:48.569
wind behind you.

00:13:48.569 --> 00:13:55.810
So, joking on Google.com but, now if people
wanted to follow along the next site we're

00:13:55.810 --> 00:14:02.649
going to look at is Surprises Galore. Do not
go to this site. Stop. I, I see you. I see

00:14:02.649 --> 00:14:05.540
you, you're gonna type enter. Don't do it.
Don't go there. He's-

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:06.540
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: Let him do it.

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:12.509
Matt&gt;&gt;: No. Why, why would you not want to
go to Surprises Galore? Well I saw this. By

00:14:12.509 --> 00:14:18.139
the way, whoever submitted a bondage site
for a public URL review, [Audience laughter]funny

00:14:18.139 --> 00:14:22.269
but I'm not gonna show that, right?

00:14:22.269 --> 00:14:25.910
So I saw the URL Surprises Galore and I'm
like, "Is this another bondage site? Let's

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:30.380
find out." So I click on Surprises Galore
and it's a completely normal, gourmet gift

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:37.050
basket, all this sort of stuff. So why do
I want to highlight this site? Well, if you

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:44.810
view source on Surprises Galore there's this
right here. And it's a little hard to see,

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:46.570
but it's holasianweb/oo.php.

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:52.630
And I apologize that I can't scroll it up
further, but it's the very bottom of the page.

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:59.069
But I can click on that, and that will bring
up this page. This is a script written in

00:14:59.069 --> 00:15:04.720
PHP sort of stuff. All the way at the bottom
of one page. And it's setting and doing cookies.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:11.630
And then it's doing this thing rubid, ruboidmon-64tld.
Anybody guess what's going on with Surprises

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:12.630
Galore?

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:13.630
&gt;&gt;: [Inaudible]

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:19.940
Matt&gt;&gt;: You all got it, Surprises Galore has
been hacked. Okay? It's built such that the

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:24.470
first time you visit the site you get one
of these scary fake malware warnings. Like

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:28.949
your computer has been infected with a virus.
Here, pay us $99.95 and we'll take it off

00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:30.829
for you. And click here to disinfect.

00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:34.310
And in fact, when you click to disinfect you're
actually installing the virus and then you

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:40.250
will have to pay $99.95 or reformat your hard
drive to get rid of it. So this goes back

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:44.620
to the fact that out of the 500. I didn't
look at all 500 sites, I looked at about 40.

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:51.640
That, rough odds would mean like 1% or 2%
of all websites are hacked.

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:58.629
Now, I'm not gonna give any names but there
are two Google employees, none of these people,

00:15:58.629 --> 00:16:04.129
but actual Google speakers at Google I/O who
the very first time I met them I googled them.

00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:07.330
I said oh, type in their name. And they were
selling Viagra.

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:08.330
[Audience laughs]

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:11.991
Matt&gt;: It's like, that's kind of weird. I
mean, that's a strange side business for a

00:16:11.991 --> 00:16:17.490
Googler. You don't want to sell Viagra, right?
And it turned out they were hacked and they

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:23.240
didn't know it. So a really scary trend that's
happening. I'll, I'll just give you like the

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.890
projection when you're out.

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:30.760
Personal computers are getting better about
security, right? Vista, Windows 7, actually

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:35.440
pretty good about making sure you don't get
hacked, don't get infected. So where are the

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:40.660
hackers gonna go? They're gonna go to your
Web server, right? So if you haven't done

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:44.430
security audits, if you use stock software,
if you haven't patched it, they will hack

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:46.339
it. And they'll do stuff like this.

00:16:46.339 --> 00:16:53.310
-I've seen Donald Trump's site hacked. I've
seen Al Gore's site hacked. All sorts of stuff.

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:57.050
And they get sneakier and sneakier. They do
things like they only show the hacked site

00:16:57.050 --> 00:17:00.680
when you come from a Google search results
page. Or they'll only show you the Malware

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.660
warning once. All sorts of stuff like that.

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:05.160
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: Yeah, the best one was when I got
hacked.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.160
Matt&gt;&gt;: You got hacked?

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.481
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: Yeah, a couple years ago because
I hadn't updated WordPress-

00:17:08.481 --> 00:17:09.481
Matt&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:17:09.481 --> 00:17:15.890
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: And when I went to the site it
looked fine, but when the Googlebot went to

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:16.890
the site it was full of Viagra [laughter].
But I could never see it.

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:17.890
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yes. Now there are tools to help you
with that. And Vanessa, do you want to tell

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:21.150
them about any of the tools to help with that?

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:22.319
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: I would love to tell them about
some of the tools available. How many of you

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:24.170
have heard of a tool called Google Webmaster
Central?

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:26.540
Matt&gt;&gt;: Please raise your hand, please raise
your hand.

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:27.540
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: All right.

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:29.549
Matt&gt;&gt;: Even if you haven't, please raise
your hand. Everyone should-

00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:30.549
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: Just pretend.

00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:33.160
Matt&gt;&gt;You were, you were literally negligent
if you have not registered your site at Google

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:34.160
Webmaster Central.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:38.170
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: Yeah. So this is, this is available
as many of you know at Google.com/webmasters

00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:43.049
and one of the awesome things that it does
is if you log in and you verify your site

00:17:43.049 --> 00:17:44.570
it will let you know if your site has malware
on it.

00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:49.870
So, and it gives you all the steps to, of
what to do about it. Because Google will if

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:55.669
they, if they see that your site has malware
they'll block it in the search results so

00:17:55.669 --> 00:17:59.570
that they're not sending searchers there as
well. And so, yeah, so this is a great tool

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:01.100
for a variety of reasons.

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:02.100
Matt&gt;&gt;: Um-hum.

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:05.240
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: But certainly the malware detection
is one of them. And I don't know who did that

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.520
tool, but gosh..

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:14.140
Matt&gt;&gt;: Vanessa was the product manager on
Webmaster Central before she left Google.

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:15.950
[Vanessa laughs]There's a lot of great..

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:16.950
Tiffany&gt;&gt;: I also got hacked.

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:17.950
Matt&gt;&gt;: Who got hacked?

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:18.950
Tiffany&gt;&gt;: I did.

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:19.950
Matt&gt;&gt;: You got hacked?

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:20.950
Tiffany&gt;&gt;: I also didn't keep my WordPress
up to date. [laughs]

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:21.950
Matt&gt;&gt;: Okay. Greg, have you been hacked yet?

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:22.950
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: Have you ever done that?

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:23.950
Greg&gt;&gt;: I'm a blogger. [laughs]

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:24.950
Tiffany: I also, one thing that Webmaster
Tools has is it tells you your most common

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:26.480
keywords on your site. So under normal circumstances
when I look at Webmaster Tools I see photos,

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.480
photography, Tiffany. These are good words.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:28.480
Matt&gt;&gt;: Um-hum.

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:29.790
Tiffany&gt;&gt;: Then when I was hacked, I was checking
Webmaster Tools and I see Viagra and Cialis

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:33.289
and that's not supposed to be in my content..so

00:18:33.289 --> 00:18:35.049
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yeah.

00:18:35.049 --> 00:18:45.130
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: Yeah, so that's one way. Another
way that that report is helpful, is I've been

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:48.720
in site reviews like this where people get
really mad, right? They're like the tool's

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.930
totally wrong. I looked at this report, it
said my site's about Viagra. I don't have

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:53.110
Viagra on my site at all.

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:58.380
And it's because they have a guest book or
they have comments that they don't moderate.

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.620
And so there's been so much spam that's been
added. And they have no idea and they just

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:05.000
let it go. One was this guy that had this
guest book that it must have been, I mean

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.110
it was like five miles long. One page of guest
book just full of Viagra spam [laughs].

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:08.110
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yeah.

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:14.090
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: So it, that, I, I, I, I think that's
a great report for this kind of thing.

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:17.230
Greg&gt;&gt;: Um-hum. In addition to that, prior
to getting hacked one of the things you can

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:19.940
do is Google released this tool a few months
back called Skipfish. And Skipfish is something

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:24.850
you can point your development server before
you launch it in the real world.

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:28.059
And let it run and crawl your website and
look for vulnerabilities that you've, you've

00:19:28.059 --> 00:19:30.690
created by, as a developer or via third party
apps or anything like that. So check it out.

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:33.210
It's all one word, Skipfish. And that's pulling
up now.

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:40.710
Matt&gt;&gt;: And if you haven't heard of Google.com/webmasters,
it's at Google.com/webmasters. Pretty easy

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:47.030
to remember. One more tool in that tool set
that I'll mention is called Fetch as Googlebot.

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:51.510
And what that does is you prove that you own
your site. You have to like either edit a

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:55.289
meta tag or make a DNS entry, something to
show that yeah, you really do own that site.

00:19:55.289 --> 00:19:59.010
That way you can't claim whitehouse.gov and
start doing weird stuff with whitehouse.gov.

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:03.570
But once you've proven that you own that site,
you can tell Googlebot, and it's something

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:09.940
like 50 times a week, come fetch any page
on my site and show me exactly what you saw

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:13.480
including any redirects, any server headers,
anything like that.

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:18.169
So if you've been hacked you can say okay
Google, fetch the page, show it to me. Am

00:20:18.169 --> 00:20:24.610
I still hacked? Dang it, I still am. Okay,
ah, fix it up, patch the servers again, Fetch

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:29.290
as Googlebot. Okay, now I'm clean. So it's
a very handy tool. I would recommend everybody

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:32.770
check that out. It's free and all that sort
of stuff.

00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:37.710
Okay, not to dwell on hacked stuff too much.
So I'll let Surprises Galore off the hook

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:41.390
now. Okay, so now the next site that I wanted
to look at is called The Hook Up.

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:43.730
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: All right. [laughs]

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:49.820
Matt&gt;&gt;: I love these URLs. And the URL is,
I believe it's…

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:51.220
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: Thehookupsite.com.

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:56.919
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yes, thehookupsite.com. Anybody want
to guess what The Hook Up site does?

00:20:56.919 --> 00:20:58.460
&gt;&gt;: [Inaudible]

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:01.940
Matt&gt;&gt;: It gives you the hookup on the best
car audio.

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:03.179
[Audience laughs]

00:21:03.179 --> 00:21:04.409
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: Woo-hoo.

00:21:04.409 --> 00:21:07.409
Matt&gt;&gt;: Wait a second, what were you guys
thinking?

00:21:07.409 --> 00:21:08.409
[Audience laughs]

00:21:08.409 --> 00:21:13.040
Matt&gt;&gt;: Get your head out of the gutter. Oh
my gosh. Okay, so this is an interesting site.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:19.280
It's a local site in Kansas, but the problem
with being on the Web spam team, is once you

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:24.700
see spam and you learn how to recognize it
you can't unsee it, right?

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:30.250
So here's what looks like a pretty good CD
mp3 player. And then it's got a list of parts

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:35.299
stuff in the owner's manual. And then it's
got white marine speakers. What's going on

00:21:35.299 --> 00:21:42.400
here? And then it's got car component speakers.
This seems a little strange. Is, is this the

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.980
sort of stuff that regular people normally
write on their blog?

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:46.309
[pause]

00:21:46.309 --> 00:21:50.470
Not, not so much [laughs].

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:53.970
So what this guy's actually doing is he's
taking press releases and just syndicating

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:58.140
on, on his site. The problem is that's not
really original content, so you won't tend

00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:04.990
to rank very highly. So you can put up a website,
right? Props to anybody who wants to put up

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:08.530
a website. But if you don't have something
original to show, it usually tends not to

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:09.530
rank as highly.

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:13.520
Now there is some original content on this
site. He has a photo gallery. And I have to

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:19.049
say, this is a really blinged out '83 Chevy,
24-inch dubs, or is it 24-inch dub-dubs or

00:22:19.049 --> 00:22:24.230
just dubs? I always get that mixed up, I don't
know. So it's kind of neat. They say submit

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:26.130
your site and we'll pimp it out and stuff
like that.

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:30.930
So this, this is a real site. There's a real
person, you know, Shawnee, Kansas who's looking

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:36.320
at this. The problem is you're not putting
enough core attention on just the basic stuff

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:40.830
of building up original content. Original
content can make a huge difference. People

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:45.779
don't get in love with a site like this, right?
There's no loyalty. People don't come back

00:22:45.779 --> 00:22:46.779
to it.

00:22:46.779 --> 00:22:55.160
Think about the things that make people come
back to a site. It's typically not a press

00:22:55.160 --> 00:23:04.210
release that's just thrown up on the Web.
Okay. Next up is Kathy Toth, who is a real

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:10.390
estate agent in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Now,
there's some interesting stuff going on here.

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:14.520
This is, she has original content. In fact,
quite a lot of original content.

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:22.110
But she's also part of a sort of real estate
network, Pro Step Marketing. And they basically

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:27.140
step out from the ordinary. We'll make your
real, realtor site step out and look different

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:34.990
than anybody else's. The problem is, it doesn't
really look all that different. In fact, if

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:41.840
you look here and do a sample analysis it
goes to marketsnapshot.info.

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:51.380
And you look here, oh, did you guys see yesterday
Google announced the Google font API and Google

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:57.950
font director. Really, it's, it's a good idea
to put text in actual text, not in images.

00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:02.820
Because here's the text, Ann Arbor real estate
experts, and there's no way for Google to

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:06.159
see it because it's embedded in an image.

00:24:06.159 --> 00:24:12.150
So we have joked about it, we have said, "Why
don't we crawl the entire Web and run OCR

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:16.770
on all images on the entire Web," right? And
be like, "That says Ann Arbor real estate

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:22.570
experts, so we'll help Kathy Toth. We will
add that text to the page. But we haven't

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:27.470
done that yet. And the Web is pretty big.
So I don't expect us to do that any time soon.

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:31.200
So in the mean time, that's the kind of thing
that you can just put right on your page.

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:35.289
You don't have to have it embedded in an image.
There was also, this is a little bit strange.

00:24:35.289 --> 00:24:41.760
If you click on blog, it goes to AnnArborTalks.com.

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:45.321
And I just want to drill this point home again.
Okay, so here's a listing of a real estate

00:24:45.321 --> 00:24:52.110
site. This is supposedly a blog. "Ann Arbor
foodies want to get fresh at the produce station."

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:58.780
It turns out this content is not original.
It appeared someone else, somewhere else first.

00:24:58.780 --> 00:24:59.780
This one I love.

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:04.070
I don't know if you guys can see it. It's
an application to marry my daughter [Audience

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:09.710
laughs] in Ann Arbor. Okay? And it starts
out pretty simple, like boy scout rank and

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:15.559
badges, tattoos, earrings. It gets down to
"in 50 words or less what does don't touch

00:25:15.559 --> 00:25:21.309
my daughter mean to you?" [Audience laughs].
"In 50 words or less what does abstinence

00:25:21.309 --> 00:25:22.309
mean to you?"

00:25:22.309 --> 00:25:23.309
[Audience laughs]

00:25:23.309 --> 00:25:24.309
All right.

00:25:24.309 --> 00:25:29.440
So I swear all this is truthful. Otherwise
water torture, red hot poker and the Hillary

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:34.289
Clinton kiss torture. [Audience laughs]I kind
of missed that until now. [Audience laughs]Okay,

00:25:34.289 --> 00:25:39.970
so number one this is amusing. You want your
blog to show your human side, but there's

00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:43.720
such a thing as too much information, right?
[Audience laughs]If you happen to be in a

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:48.620
blue state, the Hillary Clinton kiss torture
that might be a little offensive. Right?

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:53.899
So it's, it's a delicate sort of needle to
thread. You want to show a little bit of your

00:25:53.899 --> 00:25:56.679
human face, but you don't want to be like,
"I think Hillary Clinton sucks." And then

00:25:56.679 --> 00:26:02.630
you fall off the edge. Right? So ask yourself,
"Is this the right place for my professional

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:05.990
blog?" Maybe you want to have a personal blog.
Maybe you want to do this on Facebook, somewhere

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:07.820
a little more private, something like that.

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:12.320
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: I have a minor point that you,
I don't know if you noticed about the site.

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:15.860
Is she had said that she has a Web design
firm that's good at SEO.

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:16.860
Matt&gt;&gt;: Um-hum.

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:21.159
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: But I noticed that at the bottom
of the page her Web design firm links to themselves

00:26:21.159 --> 00:26:22.159
for

00:26:22.159 --> 00:26:23.159
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yeah.

00:26:23.159 --> 00:26:25.680
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: different times with keyword rich
anchor text.

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:26.680
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yeah.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:30.080
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: So, they perhaps are good at SEO
for their own site.[laughs] But I mean, you

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:35.600
really want to watch for that, because you
don't want whoever does your website to use

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:39.960
your site as a link farm back to their site
with a bunch of different sets of keywords.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:40.960
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yeah.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:44.860
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: And not that this is a link farm,
but four links to them in the same little

00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:47.220
block of text seems a little, a little bit
suspicious.

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:51.750
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yeah. It's a little bit overboard
to say powered by Pro Step Marketing, Pro

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:55.530
Step Marketing, Real Estate Web design, Real
Estate Marketing Services. What are you really

00:26:55.530 --> 00:27:00.520
doing? You're really giving your anchor text,
your page rank, to the person who made your

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:02.649
site. And it should be your site.

00:27:02.649 --> 00:27:06.530
And so to the extent that if some of this
is a little bit cookie cutter, you have to

00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:09.809
be a little careful about that. If they end
up just making a ton of sites. And by the

00:27:09.809 --> 00:27:15.440
way, a lot of these individual resources whenever
you click through and do searches and stuff,

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.990
they tend to be other sites.

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:24.860
So that's the sort of thing to be a little
bit careful about. A lot of this is like mlsfinder.com.

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:28.360
So you want the value on your site. You don't
just want to be framed in someone else's site,

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:29.429
if that makes sense.

00:27:29.429 --> 00:27:31.900
Greg&gt;&gt;: So Matt, can I point out one thing
that this person's doing really well?

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:32.900
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yeah.

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:37.679
Greg&gt;&gt;: If you go to maps.google.com and search
for Kelly Toth, or Kathy Toth, sorry, in Michigan.

00:27:37.679 --> 00:27:43.899
Kathy is a very local business, basically
a realtor, so she's got a owner verified listing

00:27:43.899 --> 00:27:48.169
in, in Google Maps, which gets her some extra
points for certain kind of queries that show

00:27:48.169 --> 00:27:52.220
up for people locally. And also gets a lot
more information than, there's actually some

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:55.380
good content there that isn't even on the
website, so-

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:56.380
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yeah.

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:57.380
Greg&gt;&gt;: -that's a big plus.

00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:59.899
Tiffany&gt;&gt;: I just did a blog post maybe a
month ago about local business SEO, and I

00:27:59.899 --> 00:28:03.960
talked a lot about ways you can optimize Google
places. So if you do have a local business

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:05.080
that might be something to check out.

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:09.779
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yeah. So many people get focused on
I have to be number one for Ann Arbor real

00:28:09.779 --> 00:28:14.370
estate, right? They have a trophy for it,
is they have one thing they want to rank for.

00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:19.279
I want to rank number one for Android apps.
I want to rank number one for Viagra online.

00:28:19.279 --> 00:28:21.169
Whatever you want to rank for.

00:28:21.169 --> 00:28:25.590
And the problem is people don't type that
in. They type in thousands of different phrases.

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:29.580
So instead of paying attention to the one
trophy phrase that's the most contested, the

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:34.320
most competitive, the hardest to rank for,
look at what is in your server logs. Look

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:38.669
at what people are already typing. A lot of
the times you might check those keywords in

00:28:38.669 --> 00:28:42.909
your own page too. And if you put the phrases
just once or twice more in a natural way,

00:28:42.909 --> 00:28:44.750
you can move up to page one.

00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:47.940
And the points that these guys are making,
which is a very good point, is that it's not

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:54.870
just the Web. You can make videos. You can
make business listings. You can submit stuff

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:58.519
to, to Picasa Web and Flickr and all this
sort of stuff. You can participate on Twitter

00:28:58.519 --> 00:29:01.220
and Facebook, where a lot of traffic is these
days.

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:05.230
So it's not all about getting number one on
a particular phrase. It's about looking at

00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:08.769
where all the people are online and trying
to go to them. Does that make sense?

00:29:08.769 --> 00:29:09.769
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: Hey Matt.

00:29:09.769 --> 00:29:10.769
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yeah.

00:29:10.769 --> 00:29:13.710
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: You're saying you could check your
server logs to see the stuff you may rank

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:17.029
on page two or three or four. But I feel like
there's a tool that shows you when you're

00:29:17.029 --> 00:29:18.080
ranking on page two

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.080
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yes.

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.080
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: or three

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.080
Matt&gt;: Yes.

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.080
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: And it shows you the

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.080
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yes.

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:24.080
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: click through rates

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.080
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yes.

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.080
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: on the search results

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.080
&gt;&gt;Matt: Yes. Yes.

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:30.610
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: and I think, we might have mentioned
it even earlier at Google Webmaster-

00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:31.610
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yeah.

00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:32.610
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: -Tools.

00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:33.610
Matt&gt;&gt;: I don't want to oversell it, but yes,
you can find out the kinds of things that

00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:34.610
you ranked for. Google Analytics

00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:35.610
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: Well, I mean it's

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:36.610
Matt&gt;&gt;: is also great for that.

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:37.950
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: It's especially great though when
you're, when you're ranking on like the third

00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:41.649
page or the fourth page, because you probably
would never know that. And you might not even

00:29:41.649 --> 00:29:44.790
see that in your analytics. But it's really
interesting information I think to see those,

00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:46.429
that, those reports that show you that stuff.

00:29:46.429 --> 00:29:47.429
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yeah.

00:29:47.429 --> 00:29:51.830
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: And that was launched well after
I left so

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:57.980
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yep [laughs]. So, another person submitted
the site called Forchan. I don't know if anybody's

00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:02.260
been to that. [Audience laughs]The, the comment
was, "How can I optimize this site which has

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:06.820
fresh content?" I hear Forchan does have fresh
content [Audience laughs]. And keeps changing

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:10.220
frequently, also true. Or is it a moot point?
[Audience laughs]

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:14.260
Dude, come on. You think we don't know about
Moot? Moot's a cool guy. We're not gonna look

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:20.800
at Forchan because I don't want to get sued.
So, moving on. [Audience laughs]Sheesh.

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:26.940
Okay. Okay, this one's great, SEOpackages.net.
So we have a search engine optimizer. So we're

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:32.740
gonna give the secret to search engine optimization.
Number one, get a good hosting plan [Audience

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:36.660
laughs]. Do not let your bandwidth be exceeded
[Audience laughs].

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:42.320
I was all set to try to give constructive
advice to this guy, right. And he's just,

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:47.480
sorry I'm not alive on the Net anymore. So
okay, we'll move on. So make sure to have

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:53.419
good up time. Oh should we, okay do people
want to do fun, evil, sort of spammy sites

00:30:53.419 --> 00:30:56.200
or more constructive positive advice?

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.429
&gt;&gt;: Advice.

00:30:57.429 --> 00:30:58.429
&gt;&gt;: More positive.

00:30:58.429 --> 00:31:01.740
Matt&gt;&gt;: More constructive positive advice,
okay. Good deal. And I'll, I'll check the

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:05.889
Wave. We'll get to a few of these questions
too. There's not that many, there's only five

00:31:05.889 --> 00:31:09.340
questions on the Wave right now. So if people
want to submit, just do Google/IO Sessions,

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:13.820
go to the session, click on the Wave, submit
a question. And we'll do, start a little questions

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:15.200
toward the end as well.

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:22.070
Okay, so here's a question from AppBrain.
It's really two. One is they make extensive

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:26.960
use of the Google Web Toolkit, and does that
hurt their search results? And number two,

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:34.860
how do you get Google to recognize their sort
of breadcrumb structure? Because you want

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:35.860
that to show in the search results.

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:41.010
So this is actually a really good question
Let's take Shoot U!(LITE). AppBrain is a very

00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:48.351
cool site. If you guys haven't tried it, I
recommend it. So AppBrain has 15,000 results

00:31:48.351 --> 00:31:49.900
indexed. What does that mean?

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:54.679
That means GWT, the Google Web Toolkit, is
not really hurting them. And in fact, if you

00:31:54.679 --> 00:32:00.610
look at the sort of URLS that they generate,
they're perfectly natural, good looking URLs.

00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:04.179
You can use a period as a separator, you can
use a dash as a separator.

00:32:04.179 --> 00:32:11.650
I would prefer a dash over an underscore,
because whenever you have two terms like A_B,

00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:16.600
Google tends to index those as one term. If
you have A-B, we'll index them as two different

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:21.789
terms. And most people type, tend to type
A B, not A_B.

00:32:21.789 --> 00:32:26.450
So I wouldn't change your site if you've got
something that already works for you. But

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:29.840
if you're making a brand new site, I would
use separators though like dashes or periods

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:31.050
or something like that.

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:35.720
So the URLs are actually pretty good. Here's
Shoot U!(LITE). GWT is not hurting you in

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:39.880
this case, as far as I can tell. Now there
is a little bit of design advice for this

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:46.559
site. If I'm interested in this app, am I
gonna be more interested in change logs or

00:32:46.559 --> 00:32:50.870
am I gonna be interested in user reviews?

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:56.789
User reviews, obviously. So why are the change
logs above the user reviews? There's no good

00:32:56.789 --> 00:33:01.260
reason for that, right? So just swap the order
of those. Think about the layout a little

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:06.270
bit. This while interesting is not really
all that useful to people. So I'd put that

00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:07.649
more towards the bottom of the page.

00:33:07.649 --> 00:33:12.120
But it is doing a good job. It's having some
normal text. It's got images. So AppBrain

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:17.130
is doing a relatively good job of having all
this sort of content, useful stuff, right

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:19.250
up front.

00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:26.330
Related Android apps, critical. Why is related
Android apps critical? How are people finding

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:34.250
this site? You're probably searching for one
specific Android app, right? You land on it

00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:37.049
and you're done, and you close the window
and you go off and you start work.

00:33:37.049 --> 00:33:45.640
Or you see related Android apps, and suddenly
you've lost half an hour because you go, "Oh

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:50.429
wow, Space Light. I've never heard about that.
Okay, Bazooka. Wait a second, Bazooka Rabbit

00:33:50.429 --> 00:33:55.700
Demo." And suddenly you've lost 40 minutes
sort of surfing through all this kind of stuff.

00:33:55.700 --> 00:34:01.779
YouTube gets an incredible amount of traffic
from its related videos. It might be more

00:34:01.779 --> 00:34:07.762
than from the homepage. So people come in
on a specific video and then you know what?

00:34:07.762 --> 00:34:10.580
If they had the time to watch a five minute
video of a cute kitten, maybe they have time

00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:14.910
to watch another two minute video of a dog
on a skateboard. And then maybe they have

00:34:14.910 --> 00:34:17.690
time to watch another seven minute video of
something else. And before you know it, the

00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:20.070
whole afternoon's gone [Audience laughs].

00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:24.860
Now you as the developer want that whole afternoon
to be gone on your site, so show these related

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:27.120
contents. Show these related apps. It's actually

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:33.410
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: Did you, did you look at their
meta description tag? Because the meta description

00:34:33.410 --> 00:34:36.020
tag, unlike the keywords tag that Matt was
mentioning earlier, can be really valuable,

00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:40.450
particularly in the search results. When someone's
skimming the search results to figure out

00:34:40.450 --> 00:34:41.450
which one to click on.

00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:46.220
And for this one I would think if you're looking
for a particular Android app and you're looking

00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:50.110
through the search results, you might use
the meta description to really figure that

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:51.110
out.

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:54.020
And they're just populating it based on the
first part of the text from the page, which

00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:57.700
is good and then it gives them something that's
unique for every page. But it causes everything

00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:02.080
to be sort of cut off oddly, 'cause it only
takes a certain number of characters.

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:06.550
So that meta description that shows up in
the search result tends to be very awkward

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:11.660
for users because it just randomly cuts off
in the middle of a sentence. So as a developer,

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:15.540
if there's a way, if you're going to automate
that try to automate it in a way that's a

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:16.540
little bit more

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:18.851
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yeah.

00:35:18.851 --> 00:35:19.851
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: easy to read

00:35:19.851 --> 00:35:20.851
Matt&gt;&gt;: Absolutely.

00:35:20.851 --> 00:35:21.851
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: and it's useable.

00:35:21.851 --> 00:35:23.080
Matt&gt;&gt;: So what do you really want? You don't
want search rankings, you want traffic. And

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:27.370
you don't really want traffic, you want conversions.
So you really want interested users who are

00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:30.860
kind of prequalified. You have already said
this is what my site's about, and they still

00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:32.010
chose it.

00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:37.320
So here's AndroidLib for example. The snippet
is Shoot U! was developed by Camel Games,

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:43.040
package name com.camelgamesshootu. That's
not that handy, right? Whereas go down to

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:49.060
AppBrain and they're saying hand drawing style
physics game. That's pretty good. All you

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:55.280
need to do is shooting the little guy to hit
the stars, simple, we'll see who it cuts off

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:56.280
in the middle.

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:59.960
Putting a little bit of work into trying to
craft the right meta description, and you

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:03.880
clearly have the text, because it's on the
main part of the page, can entice users to

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:08.160
click more often. It is really worth the time
to try to get a good meta description, especially

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:12.590
if it's automatically generated like this.
And it's not spamming it's just, it's relevant.

00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:14.330
For each page there's a meta, a different
meta description.

00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:18.960
If you don't have a meta description, or you
have the same meta description on every single

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:23.410
page, we'll try to pick out the best part
of the page to summarize the user's query.

00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:27.610
And we don't always get it right. A bunch
of Webmasters used to call them the ransom

00:36:27.610 --> 00:36:31.810
note style snippets. So we do a pretty good
job of highlighting where the words are on

00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:36.840
the page. But if you give us a good meta description,
we'd often prefer to show the good meta description.

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:42.780
Now the second part of the question from,
from AppBrain was how do I get the breadcrumbs?

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:46.800
This is what they're talking about. This is
breadcrumbs. And I went ahead and I, I asked

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:47.820
the team that worked on this.

00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:51.350
And the short answer is make sure that you
have the same sort of markup as everybody

00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:56.110
else. And then you have to be a little bit
patient. Typically it might take a month or

00:36:56.110 --> 00:37:00.420
more before a site gets processed and we realize
that you have something that's amenable to

00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:02.040
bread crumbs and we're showing breadcrumbs.

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:05.270
So that's something to be aware of. They're
working on making it faster. They hope that

00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:10.160
by about the end of this quarter they'll be
able to make that much, much faster. So, if

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:15.100
you can come up with something that's a relatively
clear structure then you might get a couple

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:20.700
extra links. And sometimes this attracts more
click through than something like /app/comgames,

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:23.220
stuff like that.

00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:32.620
Okay. Let's move onto a new site. Okay, airportcarparks.co.uk.
I'm just gonna be really kind of snippy real

00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:40.320
quick. Because I think a few people like the
sang froid and some people like the constructive

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:42.860
advice.

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:51.630
If you have good text, don't hide it under
a bushel. Check out this text. Oh man, oh

00:37:51.630 --> 00:38:00.450
man, oh man, ohhhh. Is this written for users?
No, it is not written for users. Oh, right.

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:05.840
Okay, so right here is where I can tell you're
scraping content. Right? Because you didn't

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:07.490
escape Britain's correctly.

00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:11.250
Somebody typed Britain's in Microsoft Word
which used a non-standard apostrophe which

00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:14.880
went up on a Web page which someone copied.
It showed up here, and now it's a question

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:18.142
mark character. I know it's not the original
content, because they didn't put it up the

00:38:18.142 --> 00:38:22.670
right way. And in fact, if you search for
this phrase it appears on some other Web page.

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:26.760
So scrapers, there are lots of ways that you
can spot them. And usually you can tell whether

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:32.050
something is inorganic. Do these comments
look organic to you? I don't know if you can

00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:38.060
read them. I'll read a few. F. Adams, R. Rushworth,
D. Anderson, T. Quigley and G. Foyles. Do

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:43.680
most people sign their comments with G. Foyles?
Usually they use either some weird handle

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:51.600
like hacker elite or their full name, right?
Not D. Anderson. And it's, it's a little strange.

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:57.650
Airport, airparks for Gatwick Airport. Jet
Parks for Manchester Airport. And did you

00:38:57.650 --> 00:39:01.620
notice they use six stars instead of five?
[Audience laughs]Right? You don't understand,

00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:06.170
five stars wasn't enough to convey how great
these sites are. You need six stars to get

00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:12.360
across how, this one goes to 11. Okay, so
don't just reuse content. Don't just make

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:17.051
up sort of things that look inorganic. Okay,
back to constructive a little bit.

00:39:17.051 --> 00:39:21.460
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: Although that is, okay I know that
was a scraper site. But the thing with the

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:22.960
text scrolling at the bottom.

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:23.960
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yeah.

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:25.150
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: Now that I don't work at Google
anymore, people sometimes are a little more

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:26.150
honest with me

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:27.150
Matt&gt;&gt;Um-hum.

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:28.150
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: than they were when I worked there.

00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:29.150
Matt&gt;&gt;: Um-hum.

00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:32.171
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: And I'll talk to people and I'll
ask them, "Why do you have a bunch of text

00:39:32.171 --> 00:39:35.750
at the bottom of the page? Do you really think
that this is useful for people?" And they

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:40.252
say to me, and they don't mean it in a bad
way at all. They go, "No, that's for search

00:39:40.252 --> 00:39:42.730
engines, 'cause I heard that search engines
like a lot of text on the page."

00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:46.720
And people really think that this is a good
strategy. And they're not trying to spam necessarily.

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:53.440
They just think that's the way to get enough
content on the page for search engines to

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.440
like it.

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:56.630
So of course what I always go back and tell
them is what search engines want is the same

00:39:56.630 --> 00:40:00.050
thing that users want. And so that content
has to be useful for the visitors to your

00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:04.760
site for the search engines to value it as
well. So

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:11.920
Matt&gt;&gt;: Absolutely. Absolutely. Okay, here's
a quick one, growinstyle.com. The question

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:20.030
is, they have unfriendly URLs, how much is
that going to hurt their SEO? So the URL is

00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:21.230
item.axpx item id=67.

00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:28.750
The fact is, if everything else on your site
is pretty good, don't get that worried about

00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:33.470
your URLs. If you're making a brand new site,
and you can make it have keywords in the URL

00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:38.420
 - not crazy stuff, but like three or four
keywords like WordPress does go ahead and

00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:43.240
do that. But don't beat yourself up or like
do an eight month project to completely change

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:47.040
your content management system if you can't
get exactly the URL that you want.

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:53.050
Search engines work with the Web as it is.
And Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Ask all the

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:58.270
big search engines try to cope with syntax
errors, people that don't have keywords spreckled

00:40:58.270 --> 00:41:00.240
all over their page, all that sort of stuff.

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:04.360
So I wouldn't, I wouldn't worry about that
at all. If you can put a URL in, put a keyword

00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:08.970
in the URL that's good. But you don't have
to go overboard and you don't have to worry

00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:16.210
about it if you can't do it. It's a relatively
quick one.

00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:20.740
Okay, jimdantona.com. This one's interesting,
because it's a little bit savvy and a little

00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:29.310
bit naïve. On one hand, Jim Dantona is fighting
for Ventura County. On the other hand, does

00:41:29.310 --> 00:41:32.080
anybody know where Ventura County is?

00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:33.080
&gt;&gt;: [Inaudible]

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:36.820
Matt&gt;&gt;: Okay, a few people do. You're probably
from Southern California. As I understand

00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:40.420
it, Ventura County is like near Bakersfield
or something like that.

00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:41.420
&gt;&gt;: [Inaudible]

00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:45.620
Matt&gt;&gt;: What? What? What? What? Okay, hold
on. [Audience laughs]Maps. Hold on, oh, oh,

00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:50.760
oh, okay. The mere fact that we can disagree
about this is interesting. Okay, so the area

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:57.550
code is 805. So if you do this query 805,
area code Bakersfield. That's why I was saying

00:41:57.550 --> 00:41:58.550
Bakersfield. I apologize.

00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:04.750
Matt&gt;&gt;: So, okay, so maybe, the mere fact
that we can disagree about this means put

00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:09.920
the address on the page. Right? Nowhere on
here does it have the address. It has a phone

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:12.940
number. So that's the sort of thing you need
to have on your page. Because some, people

00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:19.040
are going to type county clerk California,
county clerk Santa Barbara, county clerk Bakersfield,

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:20.040
wherever you are.

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:24.470
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: And this happens a lot with restaurants
in particular, where they only put the address

00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:28.270
but they don't put the city or the state.
Because they just, of course I'm in Seattle.

00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:31.710
But you're not gonna be found when people
do restaurant in Seattle.

00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:38.870
Mark&gt;&gt;: Yep. Here, here's one more trick.
Now this is, this text is again not text.

00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:45.320
If I click on this, check out the URL. It
becomes default.htm. The easiest links you

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:49.600
can possibly get to your website are your
own links.

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:53.290
Making sure that your internal links point
to the same place that you want it is one

00:42:53.290 --> 00:42:59.060
of the easiest things to do. If you shoot
yourself in the foot by saying okay I have

00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:03.580
default.htm, I have index.html, I have index.php,
I have it without any of those. Suddenly your

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:09.430
page rank and your links and your anchor text
can be divided four ways. And you might not

00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:10.430
rank.

00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:14.330
So there are simple ways to handle this. Just
make sure that everything is consistent. You

00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:18.220
usually don't want to have extra stuff on
the end. It just gets in the way of the mind

00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:23.420
of your users. If you can get rid of it, there's
a tag called rel="canonical".

00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:30.740
And if you just search for rel="canonical",
it's incredibly simple to set up. All you

00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:35.130
do is you say in fact I'll use our help page
about it. I even made a video, which I don't

00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:43.880
want to play. All you do is you say where
would you like this URL to point. For example,

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:48.590
my canonical might be jimdontana.com/, that's
it.

00:43:48.590 --> 00:43:52.400
So even though you might have these different
URLs out on the Web, if you can't fix it yourself

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:57.100
use rel="canonical" and you can sort of unite
the page rank, the trust to the anchor text.

00:43:57.100 --> 00:44:01.740
All that stuff into one place. And that can
make a really big difference.

00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:08.730
Tiffany&gt;&gt;: Just to add to that, so like Matt
was saying they have the default, they have

00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:16.190
index, multiple versions of the home page.
They also have the dub-dub-dub version versus

00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:17.190
non-dub-dub-dub.

00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:18.190
Matt&gt;&gt;: Um-hum.

00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:21.640
Tiffany&gt;&gt;: It's a really common thing. You
can just redirect one to the other.

00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:22.640
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: So they've got eight versions of
their page. [laughs]

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:23.640
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yeah.

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:24.640
Tiffany&gt;&gt;: All the combinations of dub-dub-dub
and default.

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:25.640
Matt&gt;&gt;: Right. You, you don't really want
to be the Octomom with your URLs. You don't

00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:29.950
want to have eight different versions of your
URLs out there. You want to have an only child.

00:44:29.950 --> 00:44:32.730
All your page rank, all your anchor text should
be pointing to one place.

00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:38.270
Another thing is there are a lot of good things
about this site. He's got testimonials, he's

00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:45.040
got text. If you click on this it starts to
play a really cool video of like, stuff's

00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:48.580
flying around and voting and all sorts of
cool stuff.

00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:56.680
I would argue this video would be a much better
thing to show than this tired slide show.

00:44:56.680 --> 00:45:00.600
Right? Because I just happened to click on
this, and I watched the video all the way

00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:05.600
through. I'm not gonna watch this slide show
all the way through. So think about your resources

00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:08.540
and your assets. And sometimes you want to
match stuff up differently. Okay.

00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:11.660
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: He did a good job on the title
though.

00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:12.660
Matt&gt;&gt;: Hmm?

00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:13.660
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: In terms of

00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:14.660
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yeah.

00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:17.220
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: primary election county clerk recorder
and his name, even though

00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:18.220
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yeah.

00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:19.220
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: it doesn't have

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:22.770
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yeah. So check out the title. Excellent
title. This is the sort of title that works

00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:28.290
really fine. Vote June 8, 2010, right? He's
managed to get June and 2010 in, so if somebody

00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:32.800
searched for election or June 8 or 2010 he
might show up for that.

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:36.840
This is totally fine. None of this seems like
keyword stuffing. It's a little on the long

00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:42.110
side as titles go, but he gets useful keywords
in there and nothing in there is at all spammy.

00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:43.870
So yeah, good point. Excellent title.

00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:48.850
Okay, so we can do a couple things. We can
start to go into a lightning round. We can

00:45:48.850 --> 00:45:50.760
start to take some questions. Strong preference
either way?

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:51.760
&gt;&gt;: Questions.

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:54.580
Matt&gt;&gt;: Questions, okay. I'm going to close
these out like super fast. This guy also has

00:45:54.580 --> 00:46:01.360
duplicate content troubles. You can build
a website on Google sites. It is possible.

00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:07.500
Discount plus size dresses. As soon as you
click it's a JavaScript link and it goes to

00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:10.390
a completely different domain name. Why would
I even bother?

00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:12.120
Tiffany&gt;&gt;: It's not even the same dress.

00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:13.120
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yeah.

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:16.720
Tiffany&gt;&gt;: That's impossible to buy the dress
you like.

00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:19.190
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yeah. Give me the plus, give me the
two-in-one dress. Where is it? I can't get

00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:24.830
it from this site? So make sure that you actually
have the stuff.

00:46:24.830 --> 00:46:30.460
Nextsprocket.com is pretty cool. It's a marketplace
for open source tools. So if you want like

00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:36.620
an open source tool you can pay $30, $50.
Is Next Sprocket in the, in the room? Maybe

00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:40.570
they're shy. Their question was, how can we
get more links?

00:46:40.570 --> 00:46:44.800
The answer is come up with a cool idea. I
think this is a cool idea. I might find a

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:50.100
couple Chrome extensions. So get the cool
idea and then think about marketing it. Get

00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:54.710
on Twitter, get on Facebook, submit it for
a site review, that sort of stuff.

00:46:54.710 --> 00:47:03.380
We'll skip on that one. Oh yeah, we don't
need. Ah, we'll talk to Sarah Science later.

00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:05.830
Okay, let's do some, oh, oh, okay.

00:47:05.830 --> 00:47:09.000
One last one. There, there is a trend where
some people think that they need a lot of

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.730
links. And so rather than develop the links
out of merit or because your site is excellent,

00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:16.750
they think, "I'll just take the shortcut,
I'll just buy a bunch of links."

00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:23.720
That is really not a good idea. You tend to
get links from sites like this. Syriaalaan.com.

00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:32.340
You get, get term life insurance quotes for
free, banking, freshwater fish and aquariums,

00:47:32.340 --> 00:47:39.070
Nike football kits, cheapest hotel rates,
Himalayan salt lamps to ease asthma.

00:47:39.070 --> 00:47:45.060
These are not really targeted useful links.
If the user lands on this page they're not

00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:50.750
gonna stay to read about the Himalayan salt
lamps. So this is the sort of stuff that makes

00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:52.170
spam fighters see red.

00:47:52.170 --> 00:47:55.120
We want to find every single one of your back
links, we want to go over them with a fine-toothed

00:47:55.120 --> 00:48:00.540
comb to see what's going on. This is the sort
of stuff that you definitely want to avoid.

00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:07.941
So if you can, I would definitely stay away
from this sort of stuff.

00:48:07.941 --> 00:48:11.740
Okay, questions. We'll alternate between questions
from the Wave and questions from the mic.

00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:15.680
We'll sort of go back and forth. Please use
one of the mics, don't just shout out questions.

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:20.210
Then everyone's going this mic. We have one
over there too [Audience laughs]. You were

00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:21.210
first so go ahead.

00:48:21.210 --> 00:48:23.510
&gt;&gt;: Can you talk a little bit more about GWT
and SEO?

00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:29.820
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yeah, absolutely. GWT, the Google
Web Toolkit, is a fantastic package, because

00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:34.880
you can do like really fast interfaces. You
can write your stuff in Java, compile it down

00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:35.880
to JavaScript.

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:40.650
Historically, AJAXy type stuff hasn't been
that crawlable, right? Which is a real problem.

00:48:40.650 --> 00:48:44.820
Now, if you're just doing something like Adwords,
Adwords is written in GWT whenever you're

00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:49.720
using that interface on the Web. So you can
make fantastic applications. But it historically

00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:53.900
hasn't been that crawlable. They've introduced
a new standard and Google supports it, I think

00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:56.540
Facebook is already adding this to some of
their URLs.

00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:58.110
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: And it's built into GWT now.

00:48:58.110 --> 00:49:01.940
Matt&gt;&gt;: It is built into GWT, where basically
if you want something to be indexed instead

00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:06.560
of just having the hash mark you can do hash
mark bang, and exclamation point. And that

00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:11.850
will tell search engines this URL can be indexed.
So we're already indexing a lot of content

00:49:11.850 --> 00:49:15.660
from Facebook that's doing this. Anybody else
that wants to use GWT. If you, if you search

00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:16.660
for…

00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:17.710
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: No, there's a little more to it
than that. [laughs]

00:49:17.710 --> 00:49:18.710
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yeah.

00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:19.710
&gt;&gt;: To actually generate the page, when you…

00:49:19.710 --> 00:49:22.890
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: Yeah, you have install a headless
browser on your server to generate static

00:49:22.890 --> 00:49:27.980
versions of the pages when google.com's it's
all documented and it's actually fairly straightforward,

00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:31.310
but you do have to do a few things for it.
But that does help your AJAX to get crawled

00:49:31.310 --> 00:49:34.920
that otherwise wouldn't be if you're using
something like the Google Web Toolkit.

00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:39.850
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yep. So if you search for crawl AJAX
you'll find a page like this, making your

00:49:39.850 --> 00:49:43.710
AJAX applications crawlable. And the rough
idea is you want to introduce this sort of

00:49:43.710 --> 00:49:47.710
bang character. There's a few other things
to do. But at least now it's possible. It

00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:49.920
used to not really even be possible. Good
question.

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:55.740
Okay, so let me take one question from the
Wave. MayDay. There were a bunch of people

00:49:55.740 --> 00:50:01.100
on Webmaster forums like Webmaster World.
They saw a, something go live that happened

00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:03.650
right around May 1st, so they called it MayDay.

00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:08.190
MayDay is an algorithmic change in Google
search results. We are looking for higher

00:50:08.190 --> 00:50:14.470
quality sites, especially more towards long
tail queries. And it's something that's been

00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:18.050
through rigorous evaluation. Every change
that we do goes through a ton of evaluation.

00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:21.990
We do over 500 changes a year so it's not
a mistake. This is something that is going

00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:22.990
to go forward.

00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:26.450
If you never heard of MayDay or it doesn't
affect you, don't worry about it at all. But

00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:31.850
it is an algorithmic change. It's working
where we're trying to find high quality sites,

00:50:31.850 --> 00:50:35.480
and sort of show those a little bit higher,
which means unfortunately that some sites

00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:40.700
show a little bit lower. So that's just a
few seconds about MayDay. Yeah, question?

00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:49.990
&gt;&gt;: So I run a popular website that is currently
number one for our particular term. I, I got

00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:57.200
a lot of feedback from my users that wanted
features. So I added the new features and

00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:58.740
I put the links to those new pages in the
top level nav.

00:50:58.740 --> 00:50:59.740
Matt&gt;&gt;: Um-hum.

00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:00.740
&gt;&gt;: And instantly I fell in the rankings.

00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:01.740
Matt&gt;&gt;: Okay.

00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:02.740
&gt;&gt;: This happened during the busy time of
my company, so I had to revert those changes.

00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:05.490
And I instantly went back to number one.

00:51:05.490 --> 00:51:07.570
Matt&gt;&gt;: Um-hum.

00:51:07.570 --> 00:51:19.680
&gt;&gt;: So what is the, the best way to add new
features to the site and not fall in the rankings?

00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:22.570
Matt&gt;&gt;: Usually that doesn't happen. Usually
just adding a link or two won't make a big

00:51:22.570 --> 00:51:23.570
difference. Were you adding like 20 or 30
links?

00:51:23.570 --> 00:51:25.130
&gt;&gt;: No, I added about three links to the top
level nav

00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:26.130
Matt&gt;&gt;: Okay.

00:51:26.130 --> 00:51:28.430
&gt;&gt;: and I fell to number three.

00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:33.570
Matt&gt;&gt;: Even though it sounds like a smoking
gun. You put it here it went down, you take

00:51:33.570 --> 00:51:34.570
it off it goes back up.

00:51:34.570 --> 00:51:35.570
&gt;&gt;: Yeah.

00:51:35.570 --> 00:51:38.300
Matt&gt;&gt;: Sometimes that still can be a coincidence.
Because when you've got tens of billions of

00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:39.510
websites, you take stuff on you take stuff
down, things can happen.

00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:47.370
The other thing that sometimes happens is
that sometimes a site is down or down intermittently

00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:49.710
and they don't realize it whenever they're
rolling out new code. Feel free to catch us

00:51:49.710 --> 00:51:52.530
afterwards to sort of show us the site. But
normally just adding two or three links would

00:51:52.530 --> 00:51:53.560
not make that big of a drop.

00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:55.190
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: Yeah. What did it drop to, from
one to what?

00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:56.190
&gt;&gt;: It fell to a three.

00:51:56.190 --> 00:52:01.367
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: To three, and it was the same URL?
It was the homepage of those pieces?

00:52:01.367 --> 00:52:02.367
&gt;&gt;: It was the homepage, yes.

00:52:02.367 --> 00:52:03.367
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: Yeah, I…

00:52:03.367 --> 00:52:04.367
Matt&gt;&gt;: It can be that you're right on the
cusp. You know what I'm saying? You might

00:52:04.367 --> 00:52:07.000
want to make sure that if you're showing up
number one for a particular phrase, maybe

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.940
put that phrase once or twice more on the
page, somewhere else on the page.

00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:14.390
Because if you're right at the hairy edge,
then having that phrase one more time can

00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:18.070
make a difference. But normally adding just
a link or two wouldn't make that much of a

00:52:18.070 --> 00:52:20.450
difference. So we'd be happy to look at the
site afterwards if you want.

00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:21.450
&gt;&gt;: Great.

00:52:21.450 --> 00:52:22.450
Matt&gt;&gt;: Cool.

00:52:22.450 --> 00:52:26.130
&gt;&gt;: I'd just like to know the small business
blog that was referred to earlier.

00:52:26.130 --> 00:52:27.130
Matt&gt;&gt;: The small business blog?

00:52:27.130 --> 00:52:28.130
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: Oh, the blog post that I mentioned?

00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:29.130
&gt;&gt;: Yes.

00:52:29.130 --> 00:52:34.530
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: Oh, so my site is ninebyblue.com
and I did a blog post a couple weeks ago about

00:52:34.530 --> 00:52:36.640
local business. So you can find it there.

00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:37.640
&gt;&gt;: Nine by Blue?

00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:38.640
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: Yeah.

00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:39.640
&gt;&gt;: Thanks.

00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:45.300
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yep. And in fact, Vanessa's very fun
to read. I like one of her posts, "Micro sites,

00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:50.350
a bad idea most of the time." [laughter] It's
sort of an underselling way to say don't make

00:52:50.350 --> 00:52:54.800
500 different sites, concentrate more on making
one good site that has branding and stuff

00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:57.329
like that. It can be really handy. Yeah?

00:52:57.329 --> 00:53:00.650
&gt;&gt;: Yeah, I have a question about domain extensions.
It's tough to get good dot coms.

00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:01.650
Matt&gt;&gt;: Um-hum.

00:53:01.650 --> 00:53:10.130
&gt;&gt;: And just wondering if you guys have, give
preference over a dot com versus a dot info

00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:11.330
for example.

00:53:11.330 --> 00:53:12.330
Tiffany&gt;&gt;: Always go with dot info's, they're
awesome. [Audience laughs]

00:53:12.330 --> 00:53:15.380
Matt&gt;&gt;: No. Iím office mates with a guy named
Amit Singhal. Amit basically guides the entire

00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:19.940
search quality team at Google. I'm, I work
on Web spam, so trying to catch the cheaters.

00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:25.220
He deliberately runs a dot info. He's at Singhal.info,
so then we can't say, "Well we don't know

00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:27.920
of any good dot info sites." Well here's one,
you know.

00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:33.540
So we try not to look at the TLD. There may
be parts, I'll automatically run parts within

00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:37.271
our system that say well we think this is
a little bit better or that's a little bit

00:53:37.271 --> 00:53:41.500
worse. But that's gonna be a small factor
no matter what. Until recently there was nothing

00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:42.500
like that.

00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:46.180
And there's no like super duper hand boost
for EDU or gov sites or anything like that.

00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:51.190
It's just people tend to link more to EDU
sites and gov sites and stuff like that. So

00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:56.670
plenty, Matt Mullenweg, the creator of WordPress,
his domain is ma.tt.

00:53:56.670 --> 00:53:57.670
&gt;&gt;: Hmm.

00:53:57.670 --> 00:54:01.160
Matt&gt;&gt;: And he still ranks number one for
Matt, which really annoys me. I'm like number

00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:06.010
eight or something like that [Audience laughs].
So he's just got so much value added to the

00:54:06.010 --> 00:54:10.790
Web. Rrrr. So typically I wouldn't worry about
it. If you can get the dot com, you can usually

00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:15.130
get dot org, dot net, dot name, all these
things can work pretty well.

00:54:15.130 --> 00:54:19.020
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: I do think though that dot info
users tend to be a little suspicious, because

00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:26.600
dot info sites used to be free, right, so
there's just a lot, there's more of a percentage

00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:30.060
of spammy info sites. And so some of your
visitors might be a little hesitant, maybe

00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:31.380
is what I mean.

00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:36.430
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yep, cool. So let me take a question
from the Wave. In Google.de I see more English

00:54:36.430 --> 00:54:41.190
results in the SERPs. SERPs stand for search
engine result pages. Why do these things,

00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:46.330
sites rank so high lately? Is this done to
promote the U.S. economy? [Audience laughter]Sometimes

00:54:46.330 --> 00:54:52.050
people in Germany get a little angry at us.
There are side effects from buying U.S. guns

00:54:52.050 --> 00:54:53.050
online so it's not good for users.

00:54:53.050 --> 00:54:57.600
So I think Google does a better job than most
at localizing the search results. So for example,

00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:07.110
if I go to Google.com and I type in bank,
I get Bank of America, Wikipedia, bank.com,

00:55:07.110 --> 00:55:15.220
World Bank, Wells Fargo. If I go to, let's
say Australia, and I type in bank I get Westpac,

00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:16.280
ANZ, Commbank].

00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:24.790
If I go to Google.co.uk and I type in bank,
whoop, it'll say did you mean bank. And I

00:55:24.790 --> 00:55:29.600
get Bank Fashion, Bank of England, Bank of
Scotland, Barclays, right? So we actually

00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:31.260
do localize quite a bit.

00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:36.940
And we can localize even knowing that some
of this stuff, for example, Lloyds TSB is

00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:41.140
a dot com, but we know that it's related to
the U.K. So we try to localize as best we

00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:42.140
can.

00:55:42.140 --> 00:55:46.840
If you have specific examples, feel free to
point them out. So Torvall, if you want to

00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:49.770
submit the specific site that you think is
showing up that shouldn't be showing up, let

00:55:49.770 --> 00:55:52.650
us know and we'll take a look at it. Okay,
question from the audience.

00:55:52.650 --> 00:55:59.600
&gt;&gt;: Hi. I have two very short questions. One
of them is regarding accentuation in Spanish.

00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:04.280
So we have the English and Spanish where,
for example the word pronóstico and pronostíco]

00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:07.980
are two completely different words with two
completely different connotations.

00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:17.950
And how is, and when I put the hyperlink with
the accentuation mark in it, the way that

00:56:17.950 --> 00:56:23.470
Google reads it, I've seen with the fetch
bot, is the ampersand i-o, a bunch of code

00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:29.100
at the end to make the, the accentuation mark.
And I was wondering how we can work with this,

00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:30.220
correct this anyway.

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:33.660
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yep, absolutely. Punctuation is interesting,
because for example in Woodside there's something

00:56:33.660 --> 00:56:35.580
called Cañada Road. So you have the-

00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:36.580
&gt;&gt;: Yes.

00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:40.920
Matt&gt;&gt;: those sorts of things. And the trouble
is, do you index it as Canada Road or Canada

00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:44.500
Road. So typically what Google will do is
we'll try to index it both ways.

00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:45.500
&gt;&gt;: Um-hum.

00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:48.540
Matt&gt;&gt;: Not every search engine does that.
For example Ask for a long time didn't know

00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:52.550
how to handle anything except for ascii. And
I wouldn't claim that we'd get it right every

00:56:52.550 --> 00:56:55.720
single time. But what we essentially try to
do is we index the text

00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:56.720
&gt;&gt;: Um-hum.

00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:57.770
Matt&gt;&gt;: -and then if we think there are alternatives-

00:56:57.770 --> 00:56:58.770
&gt;&gt;: Um-hum.

00:56:58.770 --> 00:57:00.700
Matt&gt;:: -then we'll index the alternatives
as well, but with a little bit less weight.

00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:06.510
Now I wouldn't claim that's perfect. There's
ligatures, there's interpunks, there's, there's

00:57:06.510 --> 00:57:09.920
weird stuff out there on the Web. We try to
handle it as best we can.

00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:10.920
&gt;&gt;: Um-hum.

00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:12.920
Matt&gt;&gt;: But I wouldn't say that we're perfect
a hundred percent of the time. So any time

00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:15.910
you see something where you think something
should be indexed and it shouldn't, those

00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:20.260
are a great example to, tweet my way or show
up on the Webmaster forum and sort of point

00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:21.260
those out.

00:57:21.260 --> 00:57:25.160
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: And we did a post on the Google
Webmaster Central blog in late 2006 I believe,

00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:26.160
so it was from a really long time ago. And
I wrote the post. It's specifically has Spanish

00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:29.940
as the example, and it talks about the different
accents. And so if you go find that post,

00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:33.750
it goes through some specific examples of
way different accents are handled. So you

00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:35.430
might find that helpful also.

00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:36.430
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yep.

00:57:36.430 --> 00:57:37.430
&gt;&gt;: Thank you.

00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:45.930
Matt&gt;&gt;: Okay, so let me do a couple from the
Wave. Dash versus underscore, we already talked

00:57:45.930 --> 00:57:51.821
about that. How bad is it to have more than
one H1 or no H1 on a page? We try to react

00:57:51.821 --> 00:57:55.430
to the Web as it exists and index it as best
we can.

00:57:55.430 --> 00:58:01.370
There was a study right at the beginning of
the Web, like in 2000, that said 40% of all

00:58:01.370 --> 00:58:07.750
Web pages had a syntax error. Let me say that
again, 40%. Now if Google throws out 40% of

00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:12.470
the Web, 'cause we say, "You didn't close
your table," what's that gonna do to our search

00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:16.680
quality? Chhhh, rip it out, throw it away,
right? Because there goes 40% of your potential

00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:17.680
answers.

00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:21.500
A lot of great people [laughs] on student
blogs, they're writing stuff by hand. They

00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:26.490
don't do it correctly. We still have to try
to index that. So if, if you have an H1, great.

00:58:26.490 --> 00:58:30.320
If you don't have an H1, we'll probably handle
you just fine.

00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:34.490
If you have all H1, your entire page is H1,
then you might have a problem. There's no

00:58:34.490 --> 00:58:39.830
need for your entire page to be a headline.
That's the equivalent of shouting at the entire

00:58:39.830 --> 00:58:49.090
audience. It's like all caps, right. So if
you can avoid that, it's probably

00:58:49.090 --> 00:58:50.090
a good thing to do.

00:58:50.090 --> 00:58:52.830
&gt;&gt;: I was wondering if you had any comments
on link shorteners, like bit.ly.

00:58:52.830 --> 00:58:53.830
Matt&gt;&gt;: Sure.

00:58:53.830 --> 00:58:54.830
&gt;&gt;: My company is using them more and more,
and kind of using them permanently.

00:58:54.830 --> 00:58:57.110
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yep. Absolutely. So URL shorteners
are fantastic for things like Twitter where

00:58:57.110 --> 00:59:00.850
you really need the extra characters. And
what I would look for in a URL shortener is

00:59:00.850 --> 00:59:05.710
that it does a 301, or permanent redirect.
Because that tends to pass page rank. There

00:59:05.710 --> 00:59:08.360
are a few URL shorteners that don't. So I
think-

00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:11.990
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: We use 302 in some cases, that's
what you want to watch out for.

00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:16.600
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yes. There is a great, Danny Sullivan
has a site called Search Engine Land. He's

00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:21.560
actually at this conference. And I think he
wrote URL shorteners, he did a review of like

00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:26.880
70 different URL shorteners. So you can actually
see, whatever you do please don't use tweet

00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:29.170
burner or whatever. Whereas the ones that
use 301s tend to be a little bit better.

00:59:29.170 --> 00:59:30.170
&gt;&gt;: All right, that's great.

00:59:30.170 --> 00:59:31.170
Matt&gt;&gt;: If you can't

00:59:31.170 --> 00:59:33.060
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: We have 32 seconds.

00:59:33.060 --> 00:59:37.860
Matt&gt;&gt;: If you can get away from using short
URLs, long URLs are a little better because

00:59:37.860 --> 00:59:41.030
they don't break the Web, all that sort of
stuff. Really the only reason to use a short

00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:44.580
URL, if you're worried it might get truncated
in an email or in tweet, something like that.

00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:46.480
Can you ask a question in 15 seconds?

00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:47.500
&gt;&gt;: Yes I can.

00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:48.500
Matt&gt;&gt;: Okay.

00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:53.270
&gt;&gt;: What are your views of changing in Webmaster
Tools, the location for different seasons

00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:55.150
or in a, in a SEO campaign? Is that okay?

00:59:55.150 --> 00:59:56.470
Matt&gt;: Changing SEO Tools for…

00:59:56.470 --> 00:59:57.510
&gt;&gt;: In the Webmaster Tools.

00:59:57.510 --> 00:59:58.680
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yep.

00:59:58.680 --> 00:59:59.680
&gt;&gt;: Change the location by physically for
different…

00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:00.680
Matt&gt;&gt;: Yeah.

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:03.300
&gt;&gt;: -seasons on a campaign, on a Web campaign.

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:07.410
Matt&gt;&gt;: So we have a tool in Google Webmaster
Tools where you can say I'm not related to

01:00:07.410 --> 01:00:11.780
the United States, I'm related to Peru. Even
though I'm a dot com. Or I'm related to Israel.

01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:16.970
It tends to be more of a do it once kind of
thing. I would not set it per season. Like,

01:00:16.970 --> 01:00:21.300
"Oh it's fall, I'm related to Peru. Wait a
second, it's spring I'm back to Chile." I,

01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:23.090
if you can avoid that I would probably avoid
that.

01:00:23.090 --> 01:00:24.350
Vanessa&gt;&gt;: Yeah, I would avoid that.

01:00:24.350 --> 01:00:25.630
Greg&gt;&gt;: That's not a good idea.

01:00:25.630 --> 01:00:28.720
Matt&gt;&gt;: Okay, so we're out of time, but we
will try to stick around if anybody wants

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:30.200
to talk about their sites one-on-one.

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:31.200
&gt;&gt;Vanessa: Thank you.

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:32.200
&gt;&gt;Matt: Thanks very much.
