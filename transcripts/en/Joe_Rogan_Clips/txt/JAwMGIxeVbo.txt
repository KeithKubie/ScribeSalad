Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. No, it was a fun show, man. I went into the mosh pit Israel before that song before they called the stuff for that song for most of their settles in the mosh pit and there was you, USC, uh, frontline men down there rec and in the mosque. I was in there with them. They were protected me. I was like, Oh shit, be real. You're up it up. Like, yeah, were good shop together. It was. It was awesome. There's a video of Dana white in a mosh pit once. I don't know what the fuck he was thinking. He must have been truck jumped in the mosh pit like years ago. He's a big dude though. He's a big dude. But he's jumping around and their motion around. Yeah. I dated a girl, got killed in a mosh pit once. It's, it's crazy man. I used to go into a lot of different mosh pits in there.

Speaker 1:          00:46          He's in the rage. Mosh pit. Yeah, the rates is safe, but every now and that, and you're running into a Dickhead, I'll tell you man, that the craziest mosh pits, you know, that I saw, well the craziest mosh pits I've gotten into, there was Olympus get mosh pit. That was crazy. And, but the craziest was was the rage mosh pit. But the ones that I seen from outside of it not being in it that were crazy was there was a sound garden mosh pit then. Yeah. At, at Lollapalooza early on it was, uh, when they had bad motor finger out. Oh Man. That fucking mosh pit was like a whirlpool of chaos bro. I was loving it. And that was on mushrooms watching this shit. So fucking amazing. And then, and then a slayer mosh pit man. They're fucking shit is brutal. Yeah, that sounds like they're just the pace of slayer.

Speaker 1:          01:40          It's crazy. But I got to tell you, since joining profits of rage in us, you know, when we tour Europe and stuff like that and we'd do a combination of, you know, uh, rage against the machine songs, public enemy and Cypress Hill along with our, our own material, the mosh pits are fucking crazy. But you know, there was one, one, one thing that I saw that was not brutal, but it was cool as fuck. And it was in, um, I think, I believe it was weeding or, or Switzerland, but they, you know, out of like the 60, 70,000 people that were out there, there was like maybe 5,000 concentrated people who sat down on their ass. Right. And we're like, the fuck are these people doing? I don't know. Like, are they protesting? Are Separate, fuck is going on. Right. And what was crazy is, you know, you, you're not going to stop playing.

Speaker 1:          02:30          You just keep going. So we start on, on, um, I believe the song was going real gorilla radio that we were playing at that, that point. All of a sudden we see him start doing this. The Rowan, they were wrote it. It was like a viking row. It was a fucking move. It was a move that the crowd was doing. So there's five, 5,000 people out of the 30,000 that are sitting in, you know, like next to each other lines, rows, you know, just fucking of people rowing on beat dog. It was the fucking vikings man. How crazy that the DNA just stuck with those people. And that was just the little section of it, man. If you were to see from stage, Daryl was like, it was spot like spotted groups and they sat down and they sat down and were rowing. It's so fucking crazy.

Speaker 1:          03:22          Yeah. Have you ever seen the, there was a, they did a viking chant once at a soccer game. Crazy. Aw Man. It's wild. Cause a whole fucking arena did it and you feel it. You like Yo, that shit. Whoo. You gotta think man, when they were going to wars back in the, they rallied all their guys up just like that. That yeah. Fuck fucking roller out of tune though. This fucking bolt's going to go sideways. You don't, I don't, I don't know where that moved comes from, but it looks cool when he sealed as fuck. It's gotta be an old school viking thing. They'll probably do it when they get drunk. Yeah. I mean, you know, think about it. You know they used to conquest motherfuckers so they're were like fucking row and throw it around. Imagine here it like, see if you can find that the Viking one at a soccer game. Cause it's like, I think it's at a world cup or something like that. But they're like, no, you hear it in the crowd and he like, oh my God. Imagine hearing that shit over the, when they're coming to get you towards your village, like grabbed the baby. We're going to live in the woods. Fuck you. Gotta get Outta here. Yeah. Yeah. And those are big

Speaker 2:          04:25          dude's. Yeah, here it is. Oh look at that dog tuned in it together, man. They're all insane. Look at the hands. That's spooky.

Speaker 1:          04:40          Yeah man. His mother fuckers, if somebody reignites them, imagine that they would take over the world. There's enough of them. Imagine that Hoard Cup and that shit on my fucking crazy line of DNA. You know a line of people that just were conquerors, sturdy motherfuckers, sturdy giant motherfuckers who did mushrooms. Yeah, they would. They would glaze up mushroom, their fucking heads into oblivion and just COPD slash people go get him. It's crazy, man. This is another one sitting. Other one. So that's like

Speaker 3:          05:13          thing. I guess the NFL Vikings sort of adopted this recently. They do it in their football games. Yeah. We'll look at that dork with the glasses. Put Your fucking hands down, man. Stop.

Speaker 1:          05:26          Listen Bro. A Viking breach had to figure out who beat you. Stop that. Sorry. Look. He's like, Oh, you, he'll hire you like at it. He's a spiking.
