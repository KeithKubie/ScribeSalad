00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.650
Let's once again see
if we can order now

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.620
a different set of decimals
from least to greatest,

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.760
and once again I encourage
you to pause this video

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.245
and try to do this on your own.

00:00:10.245 --> 00:00:12.370
So let's go to the most
significant place, the ones

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:13.060
place here.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.600
None of these have any ones.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.040
So then we can go to the
next most significant place,

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.370
which is the tenths place.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.120
This has five tenths.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.810
This has six tenths.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.460
This has one tenth.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.050
This has five tenths.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.372
This has one tenth.

00:00:27.372 --> 00:00:29.580
So if we just look at the
tenths place, the ones that

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.619
have the fewest tenths--
this has only one tenth,

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.040
this one only has one tenth,
this one has five tenths,

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.480
this one has five tenths, and
then this one has six tenths.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.650
So I've ordered it by what's
going on in the tenths place.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.124
Now, both of these have
the same number of tenths.

00:00:46.124 --> 00:00:47.540
Let's move to the
hundredths place

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.970
to figure out which
of these is larger.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.880
This one has six hundredths.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.122
This has five hundredths,
so this one is larger.

00:00:55.122 --> 00:00:56.080
It has more hundredths.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.816
Same number of tenths,
more hundredths.

00:00:58.816 --> 00:01:00.190
And hundredths
are obviously more

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.060
significant than
thousandths, so it

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.260
doesn't matter which one
has the more thousandths.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.320
It matters that this
one has more tenths,

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.760
and actually this one has
more thousandths as well.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.309
But now let's go
look at these two.

00:01:10.309 --> 00:01:11.850
These have the same
number of tenths.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.650
They both have five tenths.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.830
But this one has six
hundredths, while this one only

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.039
has two hundredths,
so this one is larger.

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:20.580
And then finally,
this one of course,

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.860
had six tenths, so this
one had the most tenths.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.330
So we don't even have to look
at the other places here.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.140
And we're done.
