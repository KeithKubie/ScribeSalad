00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is: two.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The value of the "q" parameter in our HTML was "two"

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
so when we submit the form, we should see "two" in the URL.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Let's go ahead and try it out.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Here we are in our browser; we can see the second radio button is selected,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and when I click Submit, q=two in the URL.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
That's because the second radio button--

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
"one", "two", "three"--its value is "two".

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Pretty straightforward.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Keep in mind that the meaning of these parameters

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
is whatever we make of it, on the Server side.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So on the Server side, we can look for the variable "q"

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
or the parameter "q", and do what we want with it--

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
or we can ignore it altogether.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We can check to see if it equals "on"

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
or we can check to see if it equals "one", "two" or "three".

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
That's all up to us, and we'll talk more about that

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
when we start working with our Server side app again.
