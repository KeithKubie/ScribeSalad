00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.485
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.870
MALIK ASGHAR NAEEM: City
regions in developing countries

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.400
are experiencing
tremendous urbanization

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.590
that contributes to
sprawled development,

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.270
a daunting challenge posing
a threat to sustainable

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.610
urban growth.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.810
Take the example of Malaysia.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.019
Nearly 73% of its
total population

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.770
lives in cities, making it one
of the most urbanized countries

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.150
in Southeast Asia.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.930
The Kuala Lumpur
metropolitan region

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.170
witnessed a higher rate of
increase in its physical area

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.880
than that of its population
over a period of 20 years.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.260
During that time, the population
approximately doubled,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.370
but the area increased
by two and 1/2 times.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.030
Urban sprawl is characterized
by an inefficient use

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.810
of land resources.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.070
For example, building
low-density housing

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.910
and commercial
buildings will lead

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.690
to the horizontal expansion
or sprawl of the city.

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.780
Look at the example of two
cities-- Atlanta, the capital

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.500
of the US state of Georgia,
and Barcelona, the capital

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.590
of Catalan in Spain.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.460
The same number
of people resides

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.400
in each of these cities, but
the built-up area for Atlanta

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.330
is about 26 times greater
than that of Barcelona.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.890
This is a typical
illustration of sprawl

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.320
versus compact development.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.870
Urban sprawl leads to the
depletion of green area

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.840
on the urban periphery.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.370
It also contributes to lengthier
commutes and higher energy

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.230
consumption for commuting.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.300
It makes public transport
financially unfeasible,

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.410
which leads to an enormous
increase in private car

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.990
ownership.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.820
This trend results
in traffic congestion

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.790
and increased pollution
due to vehicular emissions.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.800
Limiting urban
sprawl is, therefore,

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.630
key to reducing
greenhouse gas emissions

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.070
and increasing the overall
environmental sustainability

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.610
of a city.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.190
Compact development is a helpful
response to urban sprawl.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.760
Let's discuss the concept
of compact development.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.610
The prominent features
of compact development

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.570
include mixed land use,
well-developed public

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.920
transportation infrastructure,
efficient use of land,

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.610
and strict controls
on development

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.120
outside city boundaries.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.130
Now I'll explain
these three features

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.110
of compact development.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.210
Mixed land use-- mixed
land-use development

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.320
means placing
residential, commercial,

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.340
and recreational uses in close
proximity to one another.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.080
This promotes walking,
biking, and helps

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.570
reduce commuting for
a number of people

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.300
who find their workplace
nearby in the neighborhood.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.540
Emphasis on public
transportation--

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.280
the most important feature
of compact development

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.540
is having efficient rail
and bus-based public

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.090
transportation.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.380
This helps reduce
private car ownership.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.060
The concept of
transit-oriented development

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.360
promotes having reasonably
dense development surrounding

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.300
mass transit stations
as a desirable feature

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.750
of a compact city.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.850
This kind of development
provides easy and efficient

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.660
access to transport facilities
for residents and workers.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.710
It can also increase
ridership and help

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.060
make public transport
financially viable.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.720
It ultimately leads to
less energy consumption

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.200
and less pollution.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.490
Efficient use of land
resources and control

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.340
on development outside
the city boundary--

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.520
single-story
buildings interspersed

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.380
with patches of undeveloped land
wastes precious land resources.

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.380
Such development patterns also
contribute to urban sprawl

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.990
by creating more demand for
development on green fields

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.960
on the outskirts of cities.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.850
Compact development,
in contrast,

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:20.380
uses land more efficiently by
having high-rise buildings that

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.110
can accommodate more people
and by developing vacant land.

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.810
Demarcation of city
growth boundaries

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.990
also helps promote
compact development,

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.687
thereby optimizing the
utilization of available land

00:05:35.687 --> 00:05:36.520
within the boundary.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.880
Planning departments
in KL Metropolitan

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.182
are committed to achieving
compact urban development.

00:05:50.182 --> 00:05:52.720
Provision of efficient
public transport,

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.530
therefore, is a top priority.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.050
Heavy investments in
mass transit systems

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.370
have already been made to
increase the public transport

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:09.210
ridership rate from the current
20% to 50% by the year 2030.

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.660
The rail-based public transport
system in KL Metropolitan

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:19.590
came into operation about
20 years ago, in 1996,

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.880
and has expanded incrementally.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:26.470
The central area of the city is
served by a light rail transit

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.580
system and KL Monorail.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.250
Together, they provide
approximately 60 kilometers

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:33.560
of rail network.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.940
A commuter train, namely KTM
Komuter, on the other hand,

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.660
makes the city core accessible
for suburban areas of the KL

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:43.950
metropolitan area.

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:47.040
Similarly, a dedicated
express train

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.440
connects the city center to
the KL International Airport.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.280
The mass rapid transit
system started in 2011.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.950
Once completed, it will comprise
of three rail lines connecting

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:05.570
suburban areas in the greater
KL to the federal territory.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:08.930
The first line to be
completed in two years

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:13.710
will serve a population of about
one and 1/2 million people.

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:18.570
A single train on the line with
a maximum capacity of 1,200

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:25.290
passengers can replace 12 buses,
or approximately 700 cars.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:29.560
In addition to improving its
rail-based public transport,

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.530
KL is also increasing the
share of public buses.

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:39.380
Five bus express transit routes
are currently in operation

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:44.380
to reduce travel time from
outer areas to city center.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:48.640
Moreover, a comprehensive
bus rapid transit plan

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.670
with dedicated
bus lanes has also

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:56.020
been proposed to make buses
a fast and efficient mode

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.220
of public transportation.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:01.010
Kuala Lumpur's city
government has also

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:06.200
started to pay more attention
to transit-oriented development

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:10.900
and, as a first step, has a
identified nearly 70 Transit

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:12.240
Planning Zones.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.520
What is a Transit Planning Zone?

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:20.150
It is an area of 250 meter
radius around a mass transit

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:22.120
station.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:27.400
Its development is characterized
by high building density

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.510
along with mixed land uses.

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:32.840
The work on
intensification of land use

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:37.520
by replacing the single-story
buildings with high-rise ones

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:42.490
and having mixed land use is
in progress in the identified

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:44.440
Transit Planning Zones.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.990
Usually, the city center
is the focal point

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:50.650
of most economic activities.

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:54.270
The use of precious
land in this area

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:57.820
needs to be intensified
in order to make room

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:01.200
for increased demand
for new residential

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.840
and commercial development.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:06.520
Therefore, vacant and
other inefficiently

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:11.400
used land parcels needs to be
identified in order to convert

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.580
them to productive uses.

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:16.340
The KL city government,
for example,

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:19.550
created an inventory
that identified

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:25.530
821 hectares of vacant and
abandoned land in the city core

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:29.600
and surrounding area that
can now be used efficiently.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.710
In addition, it
is also replacing

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:36.570
single-story buildings
with multi-story ones.

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:39.190
Similarly, due
attention is being

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:43.660
paid to rehabilitation
of historical buildings

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.484
and public open spaces.

00:09:45.484 --> 00:09:50.304
Central Market, Petaling
Street, and Masjid Jamek

00:09:50.304 --> 00:09:54.804
are some of the examples
of rehabilitated areas

00:09:54.804 --> 00:09:59.260
This effort promotes walking
and makes the city center

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.870
a more attractive
and livable place.

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:12.530
So how can city governments
in developing countries,

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:16.120
such as Malaysia, encourage
compact development

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.650
and tackle the issue
of urban sprawl?

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:21.870
Here are some of the key
strategies to be adopted.

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:25.700
Strategy number one--
urban planning authorities

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.830
in the metropolitan
region should establish

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:31.610
growth boundaries
for their cities,

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:35.340
and development should be
allowed only within the city

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:39.850
boundary to intensify
development and use

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:41.970
land more efficiently.

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:47.180
Strategy number two-- the
proposed policies of one agency

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.550
need to be planned
and implemented

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:54.910
in coordination with the
relevant federal, state,

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.210
and local government
departments.

00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:01.150
The 2006 National Urban
Policy of Malaysia

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:06.100
emphasized the need for setting
urban growth limits for each

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:08.500
of its cities and towns.

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:12.950
However, this has yet to
be translated into practice

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:16.310
because of lack of
implementation of policies

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:21.570
by the concerned state and
local level planning agencies.

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:24.400
Strategy number
three-- the practice

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.520
of building new
expressways should

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.650
be discouraged as it promotes
sprawl along the highways.

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:33.990
Instead, heavy
investment should be

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:38.980
made in intracity and
inter-region rail services that

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:42.640
help control sprawl and
make compact development

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.060
sustainable.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:49.400
Similarly, increased taxes
on new cars, parking fees,

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:53.460
and a road user tax for cars
entering the city center

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:58.190
could help reduce the increase
in private vehicle ownership.

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:02.420
Regulating measures such as
a ban on single occupancy

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:05.160
cars in the city
center could be used

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.360
to avoid traffic congestion
and discourage car ownership.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:15.240
Strategy number four-- special
measures discussed earlier

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:20.390
also need to be complemented
by incentives, fees,

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:22.340
and regulatory policies.

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:26.974
Incentives could be provided
for mixed-use development,

00:12:26.974 --> 00:12:30.710
multi-story buildings,
and for the preservation

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:32.890
of historic buildings.

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:37.180
However, along with
increasing building density,

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.660
utmost attention
needs to be paid

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:44.880
to provision of sufficient
public open spaces and parks

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:48.690
with equal distribution
within the city.

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:53.860
It also needs to be ensured
that open space and public park

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:59.286
facilities should be accessible
to all residents of the city

00:12:59.286 --> 00:13:03.420
within walking distance in
order to make cities attractive

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:05.000
and livable places.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:11.000
In conclusion, urban sprawl
is an undesirable phenomenon

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.780
taking place in
most of the cities,

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.400
especially in
developing countries.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.560
It is a threat to
sustainable development

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.880
as it causes a number
of problems in cities.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:27.420
The blight of urban
sprawl can be controlled

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:31.530
by pursuing a compact
development approach that leads

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:34.530
to making cities sustainable.

00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:37.280
