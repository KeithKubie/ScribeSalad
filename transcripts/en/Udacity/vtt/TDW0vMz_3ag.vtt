&gt;&gt; Okay Michael, so I'm going to see if you understood that fire hose

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.840
of words that I threw at you by giving you a quick quiz.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:06.680
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.010
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're welcome. So, what I have down in the middle here is

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.420
a bunch of phrases that might describe

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.770
PCA, might describe ICA, might describe both

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.190
of them or might describe neither. Okay? And what I want you to do

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.250
is check off under PCA each one of these that applies. And check off

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.620
under ICA each one of these that applies. Okay. Does that make sense?

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:30.330
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.770
&gt;&gt; Okay. Go.
