WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.170
It's do sports,
you know,
they've been involved in athletics in some form,

2
00:00:04.171 --> 00:00:07.560
whether it's martial arts or gymnastics since they were little.

3
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.070
They do things that are difficult.
We do stuff as a family that are difficult.

4
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.600
We do like escape rooms.
We play games,
we do things that are hard.

5
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.350
I don't let them win.
Yeah.
I mean,
my,
my little one,

6
00:00:19.351 --> 00:00:20.910
I let her win sometimes and stuff.

7
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.910
Like we play carnival games against each other or something like that.

8
00:00:23.911 --> 00:00:26.910
I'll let it,
carnival games.
Yeah.
Like go to like a circus circus.

9
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.410
Like when I was in Vegas,

10
00:00:28.411 --> 00:00:30.270
I was in Vegas for this thing that my daughter was doing.

11
00:00:30.271 --> 00:00:33.620
So I took my youngest daughter circus circus playing these carnival games.
Okay.

12
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.860
I let her beat me a bunch of times.
Shh.
Don't tell her.
But that's,

13
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.010
we're having fun,
laughing,
being silly,
talking trash to each other too.
Yes.

14
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.790
She high fives me and stuff.
It's fun.
But uh,
I,

15
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.780
I think there's value in learning that it sucks to lose because that makes you

16
00:00:51.781 --> 00:00:55.920
reassess like what you did that the other person did better and how do I beat

17
00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:57.750
them?
Yeah.
It's like,
well,
we're talking about weed,

18
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.200
but weed making you nervous and makes you paranoid.
Like I like that.

19
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.490
What I like is,
look,
I'm entirely too successful.
I,
I like,

20
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.230
I like to feel vulnerable.
I think this is,
it's a lot of good to that,
you know,

21
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.400
like legitimately I lot,
I liked that feeling because it makes me,
um,

22
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.880
it makes me more connected.
It makes me more humble.

23
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.040
What do you mean you're too successful?
Well,

24
00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:24.480
you can only have so much success in this life for you start thinking that

25
00:01:24.481 --> 00:01:26.430
you're different than other people.
You know,

26
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.200
you're thinking that you're something special.
No,
he,
look,
if you're on a path,

27
00:01:31.201 --> 00:01:31.501
right?

28
00:01:31.501 --> 00:01:34.800
If everybody's on a path and you start off here and then x amount of years later

29
00:01:34.801 --> 00:01:37.260
your way away,
you could start thinking,
oh,

30
00:01:37.261 --> 00:01:39.990
I'm better than all those motherfuckers,
but you're not,
you're just,

31
00:01:39.991 --> 00:01:44.100
you just have been on this path longer and you haven't fallen off of it.

32
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.800
You've figured out what you need to do to stay on that path.

33
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.850
We know a lot of people that were on the path at one time in their career and

34
00:01:50.851 --> 00:01:53.910
then something happened and they lost their enthusiasm or their body wasn't as

35
00:01:53.911 --> 00:01:56.730
healthy or whatever the fuck happened and they dropped off.

36
00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.680
I'm still on that path.
Um,
cause I figured it out.
What does it keep going?

37
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.750
Keep going.
Don't be a pussy.
Keep working.
Improve objectively,

38
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.200
analyze your performance.
Look at what you're doing wrong.

39
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.630
Treat everything with respect.

40
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.400
Treat all of your endeavors with focus and intensity and intention.

41
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.900
Look at what you're doing and pay attention and do the work.

42
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.200
Do the Goddamn work to the writing,
to the performing.
You'll see me,

43
00:02:25.201 --> 00:02:29.790
I'll do four or five sets a night in La.
I'm doing 1520 minutes,
half hour.

44
00:02:29.791 --> 00:02:33.660
I'll do an hour here.
I go down the Ice House,
we'll do an hour at the ice house.

45
00:02:33.661 --> 00:02:38.510
I'm doing two shows,
the Ice House tomorrow night,
and I go,
I go,

46
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.900
there's no excuses.
I go,
you know,
it's like,
and to me,

47
00:02:42.901 --> 00:02:45.510
the way I've got it set up,
it's great.
My kids go to bed.

48
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.620
By the time my kids are in bed,
I leave you're out.
You know,
I say goodnight.

49
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.740
I tuck him in,
I'm out the door,
I'm headed to the club.
I'm home in four hours,

50
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.700
you know,
and when I'm,
when I'm done,
I get in front of the computer and I write,

51
00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.050
I write,
I get up in the morning,
I see him off to school,
go back to sleep,

52
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.230
or I go to the gym.
I get things done,
keep moving,
got to keep moving.

53
00:03:05.231 --> 00:03:08.070
I shock my job is the task.
