LOUIS GRAY: Welcome
to Google Developers

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.874
weekly for November 11, 2013.

00:00:06.874 --> 00:00:08.790
I'm Louis Gray, and this
is our highlight reel

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.623
of what's happening in
the world with Google

00:00:10.623 --> 00:00:12.870
Developers on the set and off.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.035
We like to start off
each week with insight

00:00:15.035 --> 00:00:17.060
from our wise Root Access team.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.740
This week, Don Dodge takes
on the tough question

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.300
of how you can negotiate
with potential investors,

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.740
and how you can
mitigate risk when

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.780
bringing on co-founders
as you get started.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.220
And is it more
likely for a start

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.180
up to succeed if the founders
have a proven track record?

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.360
What do you do if you
find another start up

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.960
with a very similar idea?

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.950
Watch as Don tackles
these questions

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.580
in our second episode of
Root Access for the week.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.340
And from New York, resident
player and YouTube Player API

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.410
expert Ikai Lan shows us how he
uses JSFiddle, an online editor

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.690
for rapid JavaScript
iteration and collaboration

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.250
with the Player API.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.150
Going further east across
the Atlantic Ocean,

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.380
we find ourselves in Paris
for two events focused

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.360
on the Cloud.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.810
First, William Vambenepe
delivers an overview

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.510
of Google Cloud
Platform en Francais.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.319
Then Ludo Champenois catches up
the French-speaking developers

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:07.360
among us on the latest news
around Google App Engine.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.070
Back here in Mountain View,
Google Analytics analyzer Pete

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.790
Frisella provided an overview
to the latest changes

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.859
and new features available
on the GA platform.

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:17.400
He walks us through version two
of the dimensions and metrics

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.290
tool, changes in the core
reporting API, and more.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.650
In Android land, the launch
of Android 4.4 KitKat

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.760
has also brought us a
new array of DevBytes.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.920
Check out
 developers.google.com/live/android

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.650
to indulge your developers sweet
tooth on closed captioning,

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.180
transitions, or immersive
mode, and getting up to speed

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.160
on the new storage
access framework.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.030
Now that I've got
KitKat on my Nexus 5,

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.780
there's no other phone
that I want to use.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.374
It's great stuff.

00:01:42.374 --> 00:01:44.790
And if you want your pages to
render faster without having

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.030
to do any work yourself-- and
who doesn't-- you can find

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.410
the latest news on Page
Speed, our tools for measuring

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.550
and optimizing your site,
in a blog post on Thursday.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.230
And sticking with
Page Speed, there's

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.340
now an easier way for
Google Analytics users

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.310
to see what's happening
with Page Speed.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.090
You can now see integrated Page
Speed scores and suggestions

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.080
right in Analytics, where you
probably spend a lot of time

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.170
anyway.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.400
And finally, last
week saw the launch

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.726
of a new version of the
Google mobile ads STK for iOS.

00:02:11.726 --> 00:02:13.350
There are plenty of
juicy new features,

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.900
including support for
64-bit architectures,

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.110
greatly reduced library size,
and the inevitable bug fixes.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.430
And to make sure you
never miss any bug fixes,

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.570
or a thing from the world
of Google Developers,

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.660
subscribe to Google
Developers on YouTube.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.350

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.200

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.925
And I'll see you in the studio.
