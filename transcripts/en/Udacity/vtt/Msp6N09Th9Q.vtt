00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now I'd like to ask you the same question

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
except for a student with high school GPA

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
greater than college GPA.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So for someone who did better in high school

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
than college, would a point for that person

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
be above the line,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
on the line

00:00:18.000 --> 99:59:59.000
or below the line?
