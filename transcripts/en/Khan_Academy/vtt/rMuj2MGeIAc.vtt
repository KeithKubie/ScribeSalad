00:00:00.106 --> 00:00:02.371
- [Voiceover] We have many
videos on Khan Academy

00:00:02.371 --> 00:00:05.415
on things like evolution
and natural selection.

00:00:05.415 --> 00:00:07.719
We think we have a fairly
solid understanding

00:00:07.719 --> 00:00:10.931
of how life can evolve
to give us the variety,

00:00:10.931 --> 00:00:12.964
the diversity, and the complexity

00:00:12.964 --> 00:00:14.380
that we've seen around us,

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.703
but it still leaves unanswered
a very fundamental question.

00:00:17.703 --> 00:00:21.560
And this might be the
biggest question known to us,

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.467
and that is the origins of life.

00:00:23.467 --> 00:00:26.260
How did life first
emerge, at least on Earth,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.777
and that even starts to
lead to other questions

00:00:27.777 --> 00:00:30.194
about is there life outside of this planet

00:00:30.194 --> 00:00:31.770
and what could it be like?

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.229
And so let's start with
what we actually know

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:36.412
and I'm gonna start with a timeline.

00:00:36.412 --> 00:00:39.260
So let's go one billion years ago,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.697
let's go two billion years ago,

00:00:41.697 --> 00:00:43.514
three billion years ago,

00:00:43.514 --> 00:00:45.618
four billion years ago.

00:00:45.618 --> 00:00:47.291
So this is now.

00:00:47.291 --> 00:00:49.010
And once again, we're talking
about a billion years ago.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.319
You'll sometimes see the abbreviation BYA,

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:55.318
billion years ago, which
is an unfathomable amount

00:00:55.318 --> 00:00:57.733
of time going into the past.

00:00:57.733 --> 00:01:00.439
But we know that Earth along with the rest

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:02.368
of the solar system was formed

00:01:02.368 --> 00:01:03.285
around 4.6,

00:01:04.845 --> 00:01:05.762
4.6 billion

00:01:06.914 --> 00:01:08.096
years ago,

00:01:08.096 --> 00:01:09.883
so that's when Earth was formed.

00:01:09.883 --> 00:01:13.353
And right at 4.6 or
even, you wait a casual

00:01:13.353 --> 00:01:16.594
100 million years after
that 4.5 billion years ago,

00:01:16.594 --> 00:01:18.738
we believe that Earth wasn't very suitable

00:01:18.738 --> 00:01:21.208
for even very simple life to form,

00:01:21.208 --> 00:01:24.758
and that's because the solar
system was a crazy place.

00:01:24.758 --> 00:01:28.988
You had collisions of all scales
happening all of the time.

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:31.363
The moon itself was
formed from the collision

00:01:31.363 --> 00:01:35.408
of two planet-sized objects,
one we call it the proto-Earth

00:01:35.408 --> 00:01:38.650
and another planet-sized
object and they collided

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.615
and then they started to spin around

00:01:40.615 --> 00:01:42.494
and one part became the moon.

00:01:42.494 --> 00:01:46.304
It was tidally linked with the Earth.

00:01:46.304 --> 00:01:48.321
But you can imagine,
that's not an environment

00:01:48.321 --> 00:01:50.650
where it would be easy for life to form.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.485
And even once the moon was formed,

00:01:52.485 --> 00:01:55.568
you had a heavy bombardment of things

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.919
in the solar system, the solar
system was a messy place.

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:02.277
It took a long time for the stability

00:02:02.277 --> 00:02:04.828
that we now observe out there.

00:02:04.828 --> 00:02:06.716
And so that continued, we believe,

00:02:06.716 --> 00:02:09.549
until about 3.9 billion years ago,

00:02:10.625 --> 00:02:13.124
which is the earliest
that we currently think

00:02:13.124 --> 00:02:16.486
that Earth might have
been suitable for life.

00:02:16.486 --> 00:02:17.978
Before that, there might have been pockets

00:02:17.978 --> 00:02:21.370
where the bombardment
stops and maybe some type

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.859
of primitive life might have formed,

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:24.529
but then they would have gone away

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:25.582
with the heavy bombardment.

00:02:25.582 --> 00:02:26.415
But who knows?

00:02:26.415 --> 00:02:28.013
Maybe they could have
survived that somehow.

00:02:28.013 --> 00:02:30.529
But that's the current mainstream belief.

00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:34.528
The other thing we know is
that we see fossil evidence

00:02:34.528 --> 00:02:37.613
for life 3.5 billions years ago.

00:02:37.613 --> 00:02:39.269
And these are stromatolites.

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.372
This is fossil evidence, microorganisms,

00:02:41.372 --> 00:02:44.962
they formed these structures
that actually continue

00:02:44.962 --> 00:02:48.355
to be formed today,
these types of structures

00:02:48.355 --> 00:02:50.298
continue to be formed today.

00:02:50.298 --> 00:02:52.483
And although it might not
feel like microorganisms

00:02:52.483 --> 00:02:56.221
are complex life, when you
think about what has to happen

00:02:56.221 --> 00:02:59.601
within a microorganism, they're
actually incredibly complex,

00:02:59.601 --> 00:03:00.855
and especially if you compare them

00:03:00.855 --> 00:03:04.702
to very simple, non-living organisms.

00:03:04.702 --> 00:03:07.535
So our current belief is someplace

00:03:09.088 --> 00:03:13.413
in this region life must
have arisen on Earth.

00:03:13.413 --> 00:03:15.596
But that still doesn't,
even if we were able

00:03:15.596 --> 00:03:18.129
to answer that question, oh,
it was exactly 3.7 billion

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:20.565
years ago was the first
time that some RNA decided,

00:03:20.565 --> 00:03:24.409
or not decided, ended up getting
in the right confirmation

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:26.982
so it could replicate itself in some way,

00:03:26.982 --> 00:03:30.813
even if we know that date,
it still leaves unanswered

00:03:30.813 --> 00:03:33.935
maybe the more interesting
question, which is the how.

00:03:33.935 --> 00:03:36.879
The how is really, at least
to me, more important,

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:39.941
more interesting than the when.

00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:42.677
And to the how question, there's
a couple of layers on it.

00:03:42.677 --> 00:03:45.072
The first is, let's just
start with the most simple

00:03:45.072 --> 00:03:48.137
molecules that we would
have expected to find

00:03:48.137 --> 00:03:49.930
on early Earth.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.944
Here are some examples
of it right over here.

00:03:51.944 --> 00:03:55.694
This is H2O, or more
commonly-known as water.

00:03:57.284 --> 00:04:01.451
Right over here is CO2, more
commonly-known as carbon.

00:04:02.431 --> 00:04:03.453
That's a little hard to see,

00:04:03.453 --> 00:04:06.286
let me do it with a lighter color.

00:04:07.305 --> 00:04:08.138
So we have

00:04:10.854 --> 00:04:13.437
carbon dioxide right over here.

00:04:14.457 --> 00:04:17.350
Here we have molecular
nitrogen, you have some ammonia,

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.366
you have some phosphate, and
many other of the elements

00:04:20.366 --> 00:04:23.384
that we see on Earth today,
they might have been available

00:04:23.384 --> 00:04:27.856
in that early Earth, but
how do they form at least,

00:04:27.856 --> 00:04:31.509
even the next step up, which
is the slightly more complex,

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:34.945
or actually a good bit more
complex organic molecules.

00:04:34.945 --> 00:04:37.569
And when people talk about
organic molecules they might

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:39.712
be talking about things like this.

00:04:39.712 --> 00:04:41.651
These are amino acids.

00:04:41.651 --> 00:04:46.561
These are the building blocks
of proteins, amino acids.

00:04:46.561 --> 00:04:49.145
You see over here nucleotides.

00:04:49.145 --> 00:04:53.891
These are the building blocks
of RNA, DNA, other things.

00:04:53.891 --> 00:04:55.427
And so the first question is,

00:04:55.427 --> 00:04:57.499
and these aren't the only
simple organic molecules.

00:04:57.499 --> 00:05:00.737
You could think about sugars
and all sorts of other things.

00:05:00.737 --> 00:05:04.285
But the question is, is it realistic?

00:05:04.285 --> 00:05:06.224
Do we at least understand how we can go

00:05:06.224 --> 00:05:08.345
from these very simple molecules up here

00:05:08.345 --> 00:05:12.294
to these more complex, often
called organic, molecules?

00:05:12.294 --> 00:05:14.707
And the simple answer is we
now have a lot of evidence

00:05:14.707 --> 00:05:16.158
that this is doable,

00:05:16.158 --> 00:05:19.929
that you can go from these
things to these things,

00:05:19.929 --> 00:05:24.098
abiotically, without the presence of life.

00:05:24.098 --> 00:05:26.136
You'll hear that word abiotic a lot.

00:05:26.136 --> 00:05:28.460
Think about it, antibiotic,
you're killing life,

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.425
you're killing bacteria.

00:05:29.425 --> 00:05:31.738
Abiotic, that is without life.

00:05:31.738 --> 00:05:34.897
And the points of
evidence that we now have

00:05:34.897 --> 00:05:38.377
are we believe and we've seen evidence

00:05:38.377 --> 00:05:42.486
that there's amino acids and
organic molecules related

00:05:42.486 --> 00:05:46.295
to them on comets,
meteorites, on other planets,

00:05:46.295 --> 00:05:49.165
that they formed spontaneously in space,

00:05:49.165 --> 00:05:52.089
once again, without the
presence of life there.

00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:54.489
We've even been able to form amino acids

00:05:54.489 --> 00:05:56.525
and other molecules like this

00:05:56.525 --> 00:05:59.672
from these more simple
elements in the laboratory.

00:05:59.672 --> 00:06:01.255
The most famous experiment there

00:06:01.255 --> 00:06:04.391
is the Miller and Urey Experiment.

00:06:04.391 --> 00:06:07.533
This was in the 1950's,
where they were able to show

00:06:07.533 --> 00:06:09.719
with some energy, they provided a spark.

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:11.899
You could imagine that in the early Earth

00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:13.975
it could have been from lighting.

00:06:13.975 --> 00:06:17.679
And they tried to set up a mix
of gases that they believed

00:06:17.679 --> 00:06:21.217
was similar to the atmospheric
mix in the early Earth

00:06:21.217 --> 00:06:23.750
which didn't have much oxygen
in the atmosphere then.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.845
We needed life to
actually start to produce

00:06:25.845 --> 00:06:27.153
some of that oxygen.

00:06:27.153 --> 00:06:28.333
And even though today we think

00:06:28.333 --> 00:06:30.795
that they probably didn't
have the mix of gases right,

00:06:30.795 --> 00:06:32.700
they did do something significant.

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.789
They were able to show
that with that mix of gases

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:37.755
at least they thought
were in that atmosphere,

00:06:37.755 --> 00:06:39.933
and some energy being
added to that system,

00:06:39.933 --> 00:06:42.371
that they were able to form some

00:06:42.371 --> 00:06:44.552
of these organic molecules.

00:06:44.552 --> 00:06:46.431
So we should feel pretty good

00:06:46.431 --> 00:06:48.958
that at least this first step is doable.

00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.545
Now the next question is
these organic molecules

00:06:51.545 --> 00:06:53.570
by themselves, that's not life.

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.298
In fact, these aren't even
the most complex molecules

00:06:56.298 --> 00:06:59.112
that are, we believe, essential for life.

00:06:59.112 --> 00:07:02.313
Proteins are where things start
to get really interesting,

00:07:02.313 --> 00:07:04.188
and a protein,

00:07:04.188 --> 00:07:05.754
a protein,

00:07:05.754 --> 00:07:07.195
or proteins are one of the places,

00:07:07.195 --> 00:07:10.847
a protein might have
thousands of amino acids,

00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:12.180
thousands

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:13.430
of amino acids.

00:07:16.207 --> 00:07:19.760
Things like DNA and RNA,
also we believe essential

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.324
for life, or at least life as we know it,

00:07:22.324 --> 00:07:25.513
could be made up of tens
of millions of nucleotides

00:07:25.513 --> 00:07:27.857
for one DNA molecule.

00:07:27.857 --> 00:07:30.445
So for example, this is just a small part

00:07:30.445 --> 00:07:33.312
of a DNA molecule, but
you can already see much,

00:07:33.312 --> 00:07:37.336
much more complex than
what we see over here.

00:07:37.336 --> 00:07:40.650
And there, too, we have
evidence that you can go

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:43.165
from the amino acids to the proteins,

00:07:43.165 --> 00:07:45.963
or you can go from the
nucleotides to the DNA

00:07:45.963 --> 00:07:47.450
without the presence of life,

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:50.239
that these things can happen spontaneously

00:07:50.239 --> 00:07:53.869
if you have the right context,
the right energy available,

00:07:53.869 --> 00:07:57.304
some people believe,
or it's been observed,

00:07:57.304 --> 00:08:00.880
that if you have the right surfaces

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.259
that these molecules can be
organized in the right way

00:08:04.259 --> 00:08:06.845
to form these more complex things.

00:08:06.845 --> 00:08:07.821
Now, I know what you're thinking.

00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:10.173
Alright, proteins are really cool,

00:08:10.173 --> 00:08:12.969
DNA, RNA is really cool, but
then how does that become life?

00:08:12.969 --> 00:08:14.642
At what point would we start going,

00:08:14.642 --> 00:08:16.623
"That was a proto-life form?"

00:08:16.623 --> 00:08:19.458
And this is where we
really get into the area

00:08:19.458 --> 00:08:22.386
of the unknown because we don't know.

00:08:22.386 --> 00:08:24.877
And there's a couple of
hypotheses out there.

00:08:24.877 --> 00:08:28.511
One of them is called
the RNA World Hypothesis.

00:08:28.511 --> 00:08:29.590
I'll write that down.

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:31.120
RNA

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.579
World

00:08:32.579 --> 00:08:34.027
Hypothesis.

00:08:34.027 --> 00:08:37.329
And this is the idea
that the first proto-life

00:08:37.329 --> 00:08:40.229
was self-replicating RNA molecules.

00:08:40.229 --> 00:08:41.915
And the reason why people tend to focus in

00:08:41.915 --> 00:08:44.731
on RNA a little bit more than DNA is

00:08:44.731 --> 00:08:46.288
that even in cells today,

00:08:46.288 --> 00:08:48.584
RNA doesn't just store information,

00:08:48.584 --> 00:08:51.668
it can actually play a role as a catalyst.

00:08:51.668 --> 00:08:54.442
And when you think about things like tRNA

00:08:54.442 --> 00:08:56.963
and you think about ribosomal RNA.

00:08:56.963 --> 00:09:00.543
And so maybe some of that
first proto-life was RNA,

00:09:00.543 --> 00:09:02.663
information that replicated itself

00:09:02.663 --> 00:09:05.321
and catalyzed the replication of itself.

00:09:05.321 --> 00:09:07.388
Maybe it somehow got organized

00:09:07.388 --> 00:09:10.507
into membrane-bound structures
so it could separate

00:09:10.507 --> 00:09:12.665
so you had environments
that were separated

00:09:12.665 --> 00:09:14.246
from the outside world.

00:09:14.246 --> 00:09:16.951
But the simple answer is we don't know.

00:09:16.951 --> 00:09:19.128
Another mainstream hypothesis

00:09:19.128 --> 00:09:21.944
is the Metabolism First Hypothesis.

00:09:21.944 --> 00:09:22.777
Metabolism

00:09:23.987 --> 00:09:26.015
Metabolism First.

00:09:26.015 --> 00:09:29.905
And this is the idea that
a lot of basic pathways

00:09:29.905 --> 00:09:32.344
that you might study
in a biochemistry book,

00:09:32.344 --> 00:09:35.661
that these were first
just happening, well,

00:09:35.661 --> 00:09:36.710
all of this could have been happening

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:38.486
in this primordial soup where you had

00:09:38.486 --> 00:09:41.321
these organic molecules
in the right conditions,

00:09:41.321 --> 00:09:43.548
maybe around heat vents and whatever else,

00:09:43.548 --> 00:09:45.765
but the Metabolism First is
that some of these mechanisms

00:09:45.765 --> 00:09:47.923
that we now study in biochemistry,

00:09:47.923 --> 00:09:49.519
these might have happened
outside of a cell

00:09:49.519 --> 00:09:51.711
or outside of life and they
just kept creating more

00:09:51.711 --> 00:09:54.373
and more complexity, but
at some point these things

00:09:54.373 --> 00:09:57.891
started happening in self-organizing,

00:09:57.891 --> 00:10:00.058
membrane-bound structures.

00:10:01.157 --> 00:10:03.438
Maybe there's some kind
of combination of the two.

00:10:03.438 --> 00:10:05.969
The simple answer is we just don't know,

00:10:05.969 --> 00:10:07.764
but there's some fascinating clues.

00:10:07.764 --> 00:10:09.653
Even if we observe current biology,

00:10:09.653 --> 00:10:12.085
and even in fact if we
see the commonalities

00:10:12.085 --> 00:10:16.085
of things that happen,
central dogma of biology,

00:10:17.169 --> 00:10:21.716
if we see how proteins,
which structures are common

00:10:21.716 --> 00:10:23.361
to all life as we know
it, it might give us clues

00:10:23.361 --> 00:10:27.045
or hints at what some of
that very earliest life

00:10:27.045 --> 00:10:29.712
or proto-life was actually like.
