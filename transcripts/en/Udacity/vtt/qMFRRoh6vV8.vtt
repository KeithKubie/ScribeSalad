00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.760
Thought I'd take a moment real quick to explain how ad

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:05.580
networks work. This isn't strictly relative or relevant to this class

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.330
but it's kind of a neat example of how cookies are

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.680
used. So say you have your browser and it makes a

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.600
request to some website and you know, this website responds with

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.050
some HTML. You know, one of the things in this in

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.450
this HTML could actually be a little one pixel hidden image.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.180
That you don't even see. That makes requests to somebody else.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.992
For example, Google.com. And this in fact happens. And,

00:00:29.992 --> 00:00:32.800
because Google.com has an analytic's package set a lot of

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.200
websites use to track you know, traffic and what

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.130
users are doing. And that sort of thing. And google.com

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.300
may, re, respond you know, it'll respond with the

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.540
actual pixel image. You know, this might be a, you

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.290
know, image source equals you know, Google something. And this

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.840
may have a cookie down there that will you know,

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.830
assign you some ID, so that when you come back to

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.510
the website again and we, you request this pixel again, Google can

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.890
track that you are the same user coming back. And you

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.040
know, that you know, that's how they know whether you're a new

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.569
user or a returning user. And, and so this is you

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:07.910
know, this is an example of, of a third party cookie. You

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.490
know, we went to udacity.com in our browser. But we received a

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.760
cookie for google.com. You know, Udacity

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.010
doesn't receive those cookies, but Google

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.340
will, and, and that's how they run their analytics. And, and there

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.040
are legitimate uses for this. You know, analytics is a really good example.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.440
We, you know, we use Google Analytics on. You know, we use it

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.740
on Reddit and we use it currently on Hipmunk, and udacity uses Google

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.920
Analytics as well so we can see, you know, what our traffic

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.290
is, what people are clicking on that sort of thing. There's also more

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.078
sinister uses, which is actually [LAUGH] Google is a big pro user of

00:01:38.078 --> 00:01:41.372
this. Now Google knows something about you. You know, they know that you've

00:01:41.372 --> 00:01:44.950
been to this website. And you may go to another website. You know, let's say

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.840
it's, it's pets.com and pets.com, you know, returns

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.930
HTML, you know, as usual, and it has

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.970
the same pixel which goes to google.com. All

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.360
of a sudden Google knows hey, you've been

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.520
to udacity.com and pets.com because they're like a

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.320
common third party here. And Google actually has,

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.820
you know, between Google Analytics and Adsense and that sort of

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.900
thing, they actually have pixels and presence on a huge percentage

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.520
of web pages. You know they have one of the largest

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.540
ad networks and so now they know this information and they

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.010
can give you ads that are more relevant to you which

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.550
is sometimes you know, you can argue that both ways. Oh

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.080
you can say that ad's more relevant for me, so that

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.390
I am more likely to click on it and it maybe

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.780
that is a good thing or it is creepy that this company

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.400
knows all of these different websites that I have been to. Generally

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.670
we can trust Google, you can't say the same for all ad

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.330
networks. So, anyway, that is kind of how they work. They have

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.270
got these tracking pixels and when you disable third party cookies in

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.680
your browser. You help disconnect yourself a little bit from, from that

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.930
sort of tracking. And, you know, I don't mean to pick on

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.230
Google specifically, because, you know, they're

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.760
actually you know, not too shady.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.300
But there are a lot of shady variations

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.160
of this out there. So, that's how it works.
