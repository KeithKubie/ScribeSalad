&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Thank you
so much for presenting

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.810
such a great Botkin Lecture.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.440
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: Oh,
a pleasure, I had a blast.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.820
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So,
we were interested in.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.150
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet:
It's always wonderful

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.270
to get an audience to, you
know, listen to this stuff.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.570
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: That's right,

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.540
yeah and we had a pretty good
venue for it today I should say.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.070
So, yeah we were interested
in some of the areas

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.680
that you touched on
especially some of the people

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.600
that you've worked with over
the years, and you used a phrase

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.560
that I felt was great which
was 'vernacular professors'.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.860
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: Oh yeah.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.460
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And
explain that phrase

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.120
and was it your creation?

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.180
Or did, have you
heard it from others?

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.610
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet:
I don't know.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:50.910
It just made sense to me.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:58.200
You know, people like Dewey
Balfa who, I mean, I had many,

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.630
many, many hours of you know,
ongoing conversations with him

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.890
about the way things
are and how things work

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.300
and who is who, what's what?

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.610
I mean he's the one who
came up with this concept

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.890
of having the first
festival in a place

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.050
where people couldn't dance.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.880
And my initial reaction to that
was like, it's dance music.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.180
What are you nuts?

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.370
And he said, no if they're
dancing they're not going

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.290
to be paying attention
in the same way.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:32.110
I thought wow, wow, you know,
I mean that's worth tuition.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.410
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.450
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet:
Or what [inaudible] did,

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.200
what then [inaudible] did
you know, turning his chair

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.040
around to tell me those
stories when he realized

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.840
that the audience out there,

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.510
he wasn't sure they
understood his Creole.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.270
He didn't know who they were.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.260
He didn't know how they were
reacting to this but he knew me.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.930
I had spent hours
with him on his porch

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.420
so he just turned
his chair around

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.220
and started telling me the
story and I thought way,

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.610
this is working way better.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.910
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.210
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: Right,

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.510
I mean where do you
get an idea like that?

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.810
Do you get an idea like that

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.520
from somebody renegotiating
the context or instinctively,

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.730
or in a folklore
class, a theory class

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.900
where you know [laughter]
they're saying,

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.390
how could we possibly, you know?

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.820
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah,
no and what's interesting

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.280
about it too is, so as
you explained the story,

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.780
he was on a stage
doing storytelling

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.570
which is not the natural context
necessarily for those kinds

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.490
of stories but you were on
the stage with him and so

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.740
to reorient to you was actually
giving that audience more,

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.130
an experience that was more

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.150
like how those stories
would normally be told.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.560
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet:
Right, they get to peek

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.030
into what would typically
happen on his porch.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.190
We weren't on his porch
but he had renegotiated

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.310
that as much of that
as he could.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.300
I saw something similar
at the Festival

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.290
of American Folklife, I want to.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.160
I forgot what year it was
but Ray Hicks was there.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.460
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.520
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: A great
storyteller from Appalachia

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.540
and they had him on a stage.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.840
It was a small stage

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.420
but nevertheless it was a
stage with a microphone.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.790
And it just wasn't working.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.320
He felt uncomfortable and the
crowd didn't know what they were

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.840
doing there and.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.370
And so, what the next
day before his session

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.580
on the stage was scheduled to
happen he was over there leaning

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.010
against a tree telling a
bunch of people some stories

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.180
like which he really felt
more comfortable doing.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.240
You know happily the stage
producer, the stage manager saw

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.090
that happening and he said oh,
okay, never mind this thing,

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.390
this is completely useless.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.040
He just went over there and
put a lavalier mic on him

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.040
and a little speaker nearby

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.350
and it just enhanced
the sound a little bit.

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.500
And instead of telling the
stories for five people,

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.500
he told the story for 15 or 20.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.850
But he felt comfortable
doing that.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.880
So, you know, I guess
my point is

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.940
if folklorists are
paying attention,

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.330
the lessons are there.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:13.630
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:14.930
Well let's talk about
Dewey a little

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.230
because you know I've
interviewed a bunch

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.760
of Cajun musicians, Michael
Doucet and Steve Riley

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.430
and all those folks and
all of them say oh well,

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.220
without Dewey none of
this would have happened.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.630
They all studied with him.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.370
He really was a professor
in that sense.

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.670
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet:
He really was.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:30.970
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: They
all went to study with him.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.440
So talk about the importance
of Dewey if you would.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.740
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet:
Whew, where to start?

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.040
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Because I
didn't know that you'd been

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.340
so influenced by
Dewey personally

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.640
which is [multiple speakers].

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:39.940
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: Well,
when I went and knocked

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.250
on his door you know,
sent there by Roger Mason,

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.200
what happened was when I went to
knock on his door in [inaudible]

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:53.090
at his house, a lot of people
had come by that point,

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.660
you know Roger Mason and Ron
and Fay Stanford and a few.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.480
There was a lot of people
who had come in, musicians

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:08.880
and folklorists and other folks
but not anybody from home yet.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.180
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.480
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: And so,

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.780
you know he said,
where are you from?

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.080
I said I'm from near Lafayette.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.710
He told me, you're
not going away.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.010
He thought you're
not going away.

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.310
You're going to be here.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.350
I could ride this
horse for a long time.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:29.000
And he was always very open
to, you know, people coming

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.580
in from the outside,
Tracy Schwartz

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:37.060
and all these people came in
from the outside but I think he,

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.070
leading up to the first
concert in 1974 he began

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.740
to make important
contacts with local folks.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.700
And I'm not just talking about
Robert Jordell [phonetic]

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.370
who was, you know just
interested in playing music

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.190
with him, which was already
a big deal, but I'm talking

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:00.070
about what Dewey often called
the people who determine things,

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:01.650
you know the movers and shakers,

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.920
the people who could make
inroads in the university

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.850
or festival programming
or television programming.

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:10.710
Or, you know he was keenly
aware that there are some people

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:16.330
who have access to those things
and if he could, you know,

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:17.630
jig them in [laughter].

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.010
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Was he that
way throughout this life?

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:21.310
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: Oh yeah.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:22.610
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And
or affected his life?

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:23.910
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: Well
I mean, when I met him.

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:27.560
I don't know how far back it
went but when, you see he was,

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:34.530
he was recorded by
Rinzler in '64.

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.390
But, by then he had already been
playing with his own family band

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:42.650
and also Nathan Abshire
and a few other people.

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:47.820
So, he had a public
performance persona

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.620
but in '64 something
remarkably different happened.

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:59.240
He became introspective, aware
of what was going on in a way

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.960
that I don't know any, no
other musician was aware

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.640
of it that way.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.120
And it had a lot to do with what
he and Rinzler talked about.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:14.330
Ralph saw in Dewey a, you
know a willing participant

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.790
in this conversation and
well Dewey was the first,

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:21.570
one of the first Cajun musicians

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:25.530
that anybody ever heard
explaining a song or explaining

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:28.810
where the band was or
explaining what they were doing.

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:30.890
And his own brother,

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:33.090
Will [assumed spelling] would
often say when they came

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:35.430
to play the festival oh 'Dewey
will parle' Dewey is going

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.700
to talk, that's what he does.

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.670
But he had learned to do that,
you know and Will didn't do it.

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:41.970
Nathan didn't do it.

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:43.910
None of those other
people did it.

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:45.280
Dewey did that.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:51.670
So he was already sort of aware,
kind of plugged into the notion

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:55.530
that something remarkably
different was happening,

00:07:55.530 --> 00:08:07.610
was available to happen
and that drew young people

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:14.000
like Michael Doucet and me, Nick
Spitzer, a lot of other people

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.230
to him because he got it.

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:18.850
You know he was very
intelligent, not,

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:20.150
he didn't have a
lot of education

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:22.710
but he was extremely
intelligent.

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:29.630
I mean he saw what the issue
was, oh there, that's the nerve.

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:31.650
There's the nerve, I see it.

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:32.950
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: What
was his teaching like?

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:36.540
I mean, how was it, to be
sitting there with him and?

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:42.140
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: Well,
teaching about what's going on

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:46.690
or what kind of strategy you
might need to be developed for,

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:49.580
I don't know, presenting
a festival or something

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:53.190
like that, was conversational.

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:56.170
Anybody who learned
music from him,

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:59.640
it was much more,
you know regimental.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.940
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.240
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: I mean
he said, you know he used

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:09.280
to use the metaphor, the corner
post, where the basic fingering

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:11.540
for the fiddle, this
is where you start.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:12.840
Everything goes back to this.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.870
Every, start here and
come back to here,

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:16.980
this is the corner post.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:20.510
So, the way that he learned
music, I mean the way

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:22.970
that he taught music to
people like David Greely

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:25.750
and Steve Riley [inaudible]
he said look,

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:29.980
play it this way exact, and
David Greely is the same way.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:31.940
David Greely learned from
him and he's the same way.

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:35.090
He said no, I didn't say
do this, I said to this.

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:36.390
You're doing this.

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:39.870
I want you to do
this [laughter].

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:44.970
He also had a very, at the same
time, a very flexible notion

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:47.590
of what was being done.

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:50.330
I mean you know if you
sang, I don't know,

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:53.920
say if you sang words to a song

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.600
that weren't the way he
would have sung it he didn't.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.580
I never saw him have
a problem with that.

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.880
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Who
was his mentor?

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:05.240
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: He
learned from his family.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:10.200
He learned from people that
he was playing with you know,

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.150
Austin Pete and some
of the people

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:16.010
that were playing, Nathan.

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:20.800
But, I don't know that he had
what one would call a mentor.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.100
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: One, yeah.

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:23.590
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: No,
I think he made this up.

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:28.890
He intuited it.

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:32.160
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And how old
was he when you met him?

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.630
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet:
Oh, I don't know,

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:37.910
a lot younger than I am now.

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:39.210
He wasn't an old man.

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:41.280
I guess he was in
maybe his late 40s.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.580
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.330
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: Or so.

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:47.290
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And it's also
interesting how probably part

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:54.200
of his transformation into such
a force in Cajun culture came

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.480
from interacting a
little bit with outsiders.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.780
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet:
Oh absolutely.

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:00.080
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: You know,
and Ralph being part of it.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:04.000
So explain how his, you know
his connection to Ralph Rinzler

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.150
and to Newport and all that may
have helped in this process?

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:09.020
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: You know
it's interesting to remember

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:14.270
that Dewey went to that first
Newport Festival in 1964

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:21.150
as a last-minute
replacement on guitar.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:27.300
And he ended up playing
the guitar so much.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.080
He wasn't used to playing
guitar and he ended

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:32.190
up playing the guitar so
much his fingertips were numb

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:34.110
and bleeding.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:38.650
But you have to wonder
what might have happened.

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:40.860
I guess eventually it would have
happened anyway but you have

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:45.000
to wonder what might have
happened if you know,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.400
the guy who was supposed to
go on guitar had gone and you,

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.570
if he had been willing
to get on the plane,

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:53.470
what would have happened
with Dewey?

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:56.260
I think Dewey had
already been recorded.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:01.450
He had already met Ralph and
I think he had already had

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:05.440
that epiphany, you know it's
like, oh, something is up here,

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:10.270
something potentially
interesting and powerful is up.

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:14.460
But when he got to Newport
I mean he saw what happened

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:22.020
and you know, he was a
terribly quick study.

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.320
He got it.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.020
Oh, I get what's happening.

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:26.320
I get this.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.770
I see what's happening.

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:32.310
Because already, that first
year at Newport he noticed,

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:36.720
you know the Tommy
Garrells [phonetic]

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.020
and the Monroe Brothers
[assumed spelling]

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:41.030
and you know all
the other people

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:43.540
who were there, performers.

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:45.310
Oh, I see what does that.

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:49.110
I see what makes that crowd
[inaudible] a little faster,

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:53.420
a little fancier, you
know perform a little bit,

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:55.580
you know public performance,
public persona.

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:57.710
He figured it out right away

00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:00.660
and he also heard them
talking to the crowd.

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:01.960
He heard the presenters doing it

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.090
but then he heard them doing
it too and thought oh, okay.

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:06.390
I could see where
that would be useful.

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:07.690
They don't know who I am.

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:10.150
They don't know what this
is, just help them understand

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:13.630
who we are, why we're
doing this.

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:18.820
I mean within the first year
he was already doing that.

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:20.120
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah,
and it's like he came back

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:23.180
as a combination of a
musician and a presenter.

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:24.480
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.540
He came back, the way he put it
himself was, he said I wanted

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:33.840
to bring home the echo of
that ovation, of that applause

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.140
that we heard in Newport.

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:38.730
I wanted to get people from
south Louisiana to hear

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:41.230
that our music was appreciated.

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:42.580
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah,
what did that mean to someone

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:43.880
in south Louisiana at that time?

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:47.180
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: Oh, I
mean in the, in the early 1960s

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:51.980
when that happened you know,
Cajun music was appreciated

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:55.550
by a segment of the
population but by other segments

00:13:55.550 --> 00:14:00.900
of the population was considered
old and passee and raucous.

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:09.170
I mean look in 1965 a guy
named Burton Grindstaff

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:15.310
who did a column for the
Opelousas Daily World Newspaper

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:19.810
heard that they were, what
he called talent scouts

00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:23.500
from Newport in the area
looking to bring musicians,

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.010
to take musicians
up there with them.

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:27.310
And he said, he wrote

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:30.290
in a column what an
embarrassment this would be.

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:31.590
I mean he said there's.

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:34.520
He said there's music,
there's Cajun music

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:38.400
and then there's you know, music
and they don't want anything

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.700
to do with each other.

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:42.330
He said it's like cats
fighting under the porch.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:43.750
And he said.

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:45.050
He made a prediction.

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:51.750
He said it would be terrible
and embarrassing if one

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:54.450
of those talent scouts took
some of these recordings

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:55.750
that they're making
back up there

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:59.370
and they got a faulty
needle and heard it wrong

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:01.370
and thought it was good
and invited us up there.

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:02.670
What an embarrassment
it would be.

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:04.680
Well it turns out it wasn't
an embarrassment at all,

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:06.000
it was exactly the opposite.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.810
So you know, there was a
prevailing notion among certain

00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:11.770
segments of the society that
this was, well they referred

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:13.740
to it as nothing but
shankey shank [phonetic].

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:17.970
It was considered old
and passee and you know

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:21.600
with the Americanization process
it was precisely something

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.020
that Cajuns should be
trying to get away from,

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:27.020
run [inaudible] away from.

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:33.560
And Dewey said, well no,
they're loving this up there.

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:34.860
Why wouldn't we love it?

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:38.370
Why can't we appreciate
our own treasure?

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:43.340
When he started talking to
Jimmy Domengeaux, the chairman

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:44.940
of the council for the
development of French

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:47.830
in Louisiana about Cajun music,

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:52.400
it happened before '74,
a few years before.

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:59.890
CODOFIL was created to restore
French in Louisiana, to preserve

00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:01.870
and restore French in Louisiana.

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:06.870
And Dewey understood,
or thought,

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:09.500
understood that you
know, you don't.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.740
Language and culture
are not separable.

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:15.180
I mean language doesn't
exist in a vacuum,

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:19.400
it exists to express
things in a culture.

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:23.370
And so he started trying
to talk to Jimmy Domengeaux

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:29.200
about integrating, incorporating
local Louisiana French cultural

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:34.180
effects into this
effort to try to preserve

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:36.860
and promote the French
language of Louisiana

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:40.050
and Domengeaux was
not a Cajun music fan.

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:44.280
He was more like the
Burton Grindstaff, you know.

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:48.080
He liked jazz, he liked
New Orleans Dixieland jazz.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:51.080
And he thought that, the only
Cajun music he had ever heard

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:56.270
was, you know raucous and
kind of out of tune and played

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:58.580
by a bunch of drunks or I
don't know what, something.

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:00.600
And Dewey was talking to him.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:05.980
He talked to him over a
number occasions and he said,

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:07.670
you know, you don't like this.

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:08.970
You think you don't like this

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:12.410
because you've only
heard it poorly played.

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:15.690
If you heard it well played
you would change your mind.

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:18.960
And Domengeaux of course
would blow him off.

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.350
Oh, I don't know about all that.

00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:25.580
You Balfa boys want to try to
bring this, that raucous stuff.

00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:34.720
Well, at one point Dewey
Balfa and Leo LeBlanc

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:39.110
who was the representative
of the Quebec government

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:46.790
in Lafayette helping CODOFIL to
conceptualize what it was doing.

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:50.820
Leo LeBlanc was a guitar player
from New Brunswick originally

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:55.180
and he understood
Dewey's message and he

00:17:55.180 --> 00:18:01.580
and Dewey blindsided Domengeaux
at a party just outside

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:06.620
of Lafayette, between
Lafayette and [inaudible].

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:11.250
They were at somebody's
camp and he said,

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:12.560
oh that's one of the Balfas.

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.370
That's one of those Balfas
that's always talking

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:15.850
about that damn Cajun music.

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:20.520
And he said I got my fiddle in
the car and Leo has a guitar,

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:22.960
let me play you something
and Dewey played of course.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:26.070
Dewey was you know great
right, Dewey plays his stuff.

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:30.850
And Domengeaux says wow, I
never anything like that.

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:34.670
And that was the
beginning of the flip.

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:39.420
A few, just a short time
later Domengeaux accepted the,

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:43.590
you know, the idea to
produce that first concert.

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:49.500
By the way, did you ever
hear about how that happened?

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:50.800
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Tell us.

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:52.100
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet:

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:53.400
It started out to
be a demonstration

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.710
to 150 French-language
journalists from all

00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:59.260
over the world who happened
to be having their convention

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:03.110
in Lafayette and CODOFIL,

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:05.480
Domengeaux was concerned
that they.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:08.530
He wanted them to write positive
things about the presence

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:09.910
of the French language
in Louisiana.

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:11.210
He didn't want them to
write about, you know,

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:12.840
this whole thing is dead.

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:18.200
And so he was trying to figure
out ways to present them some,

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:22.290
some local culture in French.

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:25.180
And up until then CODOFIL
had been very cerebral.

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:26.550
It had been top-down.

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:30.740
It had been, you know,
imported French from France.

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:36.890
And Dewey kept saying you know
we have this stuff from here.

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:38.480
We could show them.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:43.010
And after he heard that
performance, that improvised,

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:45.110
impromptu performance
at the camp,

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:47.540
he said well maybe
so, maybe so you know.

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:50.640
So we started talking
to him and I had worked

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:54.340
on the Smithsonian
Festival in '74 so I kind

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:58.580
of had a notion of,
I had met Ralph

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:00.970
and we started working
on this thing.

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:11.200
And CODOFIL representatives
and Domengeaux accepted

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.240
to do this concert but it
was supposed to be a very,

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:16.050
very slow-key, small
format thing.

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:17.520
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And where
was it taking place?

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.920
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: Well,
it was going to take place

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:25.220
in a theater on campus, look
it, you know, seating capacity

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:27.510
of about 350 or 400 people.

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:29.280
It was mostly, it was
for the journalists.

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:32.230
It was just going to be a
demonstration of Cajun music

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:34.660
to them and Creole music.

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:35.960
Then we started.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.260
As we were working on
this we thought, you know,

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:40.360
maybe some people from
the public might want to,

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:43.210
might be interested in coming
so we decided to open it

00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:47.860
up a little bit to a
nearby ballroom and then

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:52.130
to a larger venue in
the municipal auditorium

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:53.750
which seated about 3000.

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:56.500
Because we were getting
feedback from the public, yeah,

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:57.800
you know I might want to like.

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.540
I might want to see that.

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:04.590
And then we ended up with
the Blackham Coliseum

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:07.720
which had a capacity
of 12,000 people.

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:11.530
But Domengeaux at that point
got cold feet and he said man,

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:15.480
you know if we do this in
there and it's half full,

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:16.780
it's going to look half empty.

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:19.750
There's going to be
a lot of empty seats.

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:21.050
I don't know why but I felt

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:23.320
like you know this
[inaudible] is going to work.

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:24.620
I think it's going to work.

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:25.920
I was all-in.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:31.020
You know on the poker
table, I was all-in.

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:35.290
And we ended up doing it
there and Leo LeBlanc,

00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:39.440
that same Leo LeBlanc was
writing press releases,

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.770
sending them out in the
newspaper, getting people kind

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:43.270
of excited about this.

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:48.840
But honestly, we had no idea
if anybody was going to come.

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:50.140
We didn't.

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:51.440
I didn't even know if the
musicians were going to come.

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:53.590
We weren't paying them anything.

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:56.480
And we were talking
about Clifton Chenier

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.830
and the Balfa Brothers and
Nathan Abshire and [inaudible]

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:00.990
and Canray, I mean you know.

00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:02.790
And we didn't know if any
of them would show up.

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:06.230
And then, that day,
it starts pouring

00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:08.620
down raining, I mean
cats and dogs.

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:09.920
There was a foot
and a half of water

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.330
on Johnson [assumed
spelling] Street right outside

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.190
of the coliseum.

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:14.680
I thought, oh well there's it.

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:18.760
You know if this
goes bad I'm done.

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:21.570
I'm just moving to
California or something.

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:24.470
I'm going to be done here.

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:25.770
Well, about 4.

00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:27.820
The schedule started at 7.

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:35.650
About 4:30 Lionel LeLieux,
"Bois Sec" Ardoin and Canray

00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:39.310
and a couple of ballad singers
showed up, their pants rolled

00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:41.850
up above their knees,
walking through.

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:44.310
Where do we plug in?

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:47.070
Well, this may work,
something is going to happen.

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:48.860
Sure enough, everybody
showed up.

00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:50.730
The people start
coming, coming and coming

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:52.030
and coming and coming.

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:53.330
It's still raining
cats and dogs.

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:54.630
People are pouring in there.

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:55.930
It filled the place up.

00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:57.440
I thought Oh My God,
this is way.

00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.240
We had set up.

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.440
We had set up, can you see this?

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:05.450
If you think of this as an oval,
we had set up the stage here

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:08.200
so that even, if we just
got two-thirds of the crowd.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.500
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Right, right, right.

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:10.800
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet:
It wouldn't look so bad.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.100
They filled backstage too.

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:13.400
It filled everywhere.

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.160
The whole place was surrounded.

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:18.350
Look at this and it went off.

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:20.500
It was an amazing night.

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:24.000
The energy, people were hearing
this music for the first time

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.920
that way and you could
tell there was a buzz.

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:28.340
People were talking.

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:31.240
And so I went to
Domengeaux backstage

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.660
and I said you owe
me an apology.

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:35.400
And he said I don't
apologize to anybody

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.870
but he said but you were right.

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:42.140
This is amazing and
that's what started.

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:47.050
That's what plugged Dewey
Balfa into the local community

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:49.190
in a very serious way.

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:55.130
He became an icon for us.

00:23:55.130 --> 00:24:00.160
That had already started
happening at Newport and Chicago

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:02.120
and other national
folk festivals

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:05.330
and those other places,
the Smithsonian but he.

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:06.780
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: He
was sort of an icon

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:09.210
of Cajun music to the outside.

00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:10.510
Then he became, yeah.

00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:11.810
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: [Multiple
speakers] he really hit the

00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:13.110
stride after that.

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:14.410
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Can you explain?

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:16.610
When you were growing up,
were you aware of Cajun music?

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:17.910
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet:
Oh yeah, sure.

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:19.210
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: How
was Cajun music?

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:20.510
How was your family structured

00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:24.380
or where did they
fall in the community?

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:25.680
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet:
My dad was a barber.

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:27.040
My mother was a beautician.

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:32.080
There was always a hair
in the soup in our family.

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.860
But you know, working
class folks and.

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:37.560
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Was there
music in your family?

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:38.860
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet:
No, nobody played.

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:41.070
My father whistled
that was about it.

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:43.330
But, he was a great
whistler too man.

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:46.540
He couldn't carry a tune
vocally to save his soul

00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:49.390
but he could whistle
like, amazing.

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:53.510
But, no, you know we
would hear Cajun music,

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:58.870
go to a wedding dance
or sometimes we'd go

00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:01.880
out to a party somewhere
and somebody was playing.

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:03.180
We had some records.

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:07.320
Daddy's favorite record was
the Ira LeJeune reissues.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:08.620
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:13.010
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet:
And we heard Aldus Roger

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:14.850
and the Lafayette Playboys

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:17.590
on Saturday afternoons
on television.

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:19.370
And you know it's just
something that was always there.

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:22.200
We weren't all that, I mean
to be honest, you know,

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:27.020
we had the Beatles and Bob Dylan
and the Rolling Stones and all

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:28.720
that other stuff going,
Chuck Berry and all

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.020
that stuff going on, right,

00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:36.380
so that was really the
bulk of our musical world.

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:40.970
But there was this stuff and it
was ours and I enjoyed listening

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:43.820
to that as much as
anything else.

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:50.300
I didn't do it as often until I
realized, oh wait, this is us.

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:51.600
This is what we have.

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:58.550
This is the treasure
that we need to value.

00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:01.710
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And
your, your early training

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:03.180
and you mentioned that you went

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:05.690
to Indiana originally
to study French?

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:06.990
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: I did.

00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:08.290
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
French literature

00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:10.080
as opposed to folklore.

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:15.030
So, that was the angle that
you first came to it from.

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:16.330
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: Yeah,
I've got to tell you, you know,

00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:20.480
for me studying French
after that 8th grade class,

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.190
studying French was really
the path of least resistance.

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:24.490
It was lazy.

00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:25.790
It was the lazy way.

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:28.200
[Inaudible] was easy for me,
I spoke French from home.

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:31.410
I walked into a classroom and
I already knew it was a plume

00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:32.710
and papier and [foreign
language spoken].

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:34.010
I knew all that stuff.

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:36.310
I knew how to, nobody had
to teach me how to make it,

00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:37.610
do the 'passe compose'.

00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:39.420
I knew how to say 'I ate
something yesterday'.

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:40.720
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.460
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet:
So, what I had to figure

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:45.970
out was two things,
one, how to write

00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:50.700
and read what I already
knew how to say but also how

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:55.500
to negotiate a place
for the local vernacular

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:56.860
into the larger scheme

00:26:56.860 --> 00:27:00.150
of the way the French
language works in the world.

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.760
That ended up becoming one

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:07.300
of my 'cheval de
guerre' over my career.

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:09.510
I did not want to I didn't want

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:12.980
to declare independence
for Cajun French.

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:19.930
I wanted to force the French
to accept us at the table.

00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:21.790
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah, I
mean that, it makes sense

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:24.710
as a strategy in the sense
that French is a huge force

00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:27.310
in the world and why
separate yourself

00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:29.350
from that if you could join it.

00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:32.530
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: Yeah,
and early, early on in that,

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:34.890
the going was pretty
tough because you know,

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:39.770
the French can be very, kind

00:27:39.770 --> 00:27:42.740
of closed-minded
about what French is.

00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:44.040
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Sure.

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.340
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: You
know [foreign language spoken]

00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:46.640
as they say.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:55.670
And it was with the eventual
explosion on to the concept

00:27:55.670 --> 00:27:59.890
of La Francophonie where
you know, there were lots

00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:01.750
of countries in the world
where French was spoken

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:04.480
but not necessarily like France

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:07.130
and their references
were not French.

00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:10.480
They were West African or
Northern African or Belgian

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:13.660
or Quebecois or Louisianan.

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:23.770
And once that notion of a
larger context for French

00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:32.350
in the Francophone world emerged
it enabled places like Louisiana

00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:38.900
to figure out a way to
preserve our own specificity,

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:41.900
the way which, because
you know, the business

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:43.970
about preserving French and
teaching French in Louisiana,

00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:46.430
what's the point unless it's the
French that produced those songs

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:50.700
and stories that we value
so much, I mean right?

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:53.900
That was not an easy
goal in the beginning.

00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:57.660
I mean I remember people from
France would come to visit us,

00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:01.470
to visit this sort of you
know, linguistic museum

00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:02.770
or something [laughter],

00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:04.920
linguistic living museum
and they would say.

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:07.900
We would say something in
French and they would say,

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:09.780
oh [foreign language spoken],
you know, that's not said.

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:11.450
And we'll finally learn to
say [foreign language spoken].

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:16.560
Of course it's said,
I just said it.

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:17.870
And then they would say oh.

00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:19.770
They figured out well, you know,

00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:24.670
it may not be politically
correct to, you know judge

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:27.480
like that so they started saying
oh [foreign language spoken]

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:30.120
it's interesting
how you say that.

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:33.260
Then we learned to say no,
here it's not interesting

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:34.560
at all, here it's usual.

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:38.370
Here, you're interesting and
like it turned the tables

00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:41.800
on them [laughter]
especially people from France.

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:45.550
But, two things, two
people I usually,

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:48.530
I offer to quote in that regard.

00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:52.840
One, ironically is Nicolas
Sarkozy, the former president

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:57.410
of France who said,
referring to la Francophonie

00:29:57.410 --> 00:30:07.260
that its biggest weakness
was that it was the only one

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:12.060
who didn't recognize its own
strength, if you understand.

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:15.460
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
The only one of what?

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:16.760
I'm sorry.

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:18.060
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: The
only [foreign language spoken].

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:19.360
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: I
see, okay yeah, right.

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:20.660
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet:

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:23.830
La Francophonie doesn't
recognize its own strength.

00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:26.100
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Everybody else recognizes it

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:28.110
but La Francophonie
does not, right, yeah.

00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:29.920
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet:
Yeah, right, right,

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:37.130
and what he meant was it's
actually a sign of strength,

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:39.540
this diversity, this
linguistic diversity.

00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:43.600
It's not a sign of
French being deteriorated.

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:47.330
On the contrary, it's a sign
of French being enriched

00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:50.570
by all these variant contexts.

00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:59.010
And the other is a novelist, a
Quebecois novelist who wrote the

00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:02.640
"The couteau sur la
table" Jacques Godbout,

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:10.990
who wrote in the preface of that
novel [foreign language spoken].

00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:19.900
Instead of being French we
prefer to be ourselves in French

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:29.670
and therein is precisely
what, you know,

00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:34.550
what I think we were
after in Louisiana.

00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:39.840
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah, that's
a great quote [laughter].

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:42.290
So, you know being at.

00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:43.970
Yeah, go on.

00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:45.830
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet:
Interestingly,

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:48.920
no interestingly you
know I didn't talk a lot

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:51.050
about the French side of it, I
talked about the folklore side

00:31:51.050 --> 00:31:54.370
of it but the two were in
my mind, in my experience,

00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:56.620
the two were inextricably
linked.

00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:58.790
It was all part of
the same thing

00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:05.130
and that same thing was finding
and recognizing and valuing

00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:10.980
that ourselves, who we are and
how we speak and what we do,

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:12.740
how we sing, how we
dance, everything.

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:14.920
It was all part of
the same thing

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:17.720
and the French language
was a part of that.

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:23.020
In fact I sometimes got
accused of being so attached

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:26.390
to the French expression
of things that I was kind

00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:31.200
of turning up my nose at some
of the groups in South Louisiana

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.750
who were singing in English.

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:35.190
And I said guilty as charged.

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:37.410
I mean it is a French thing.

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:38.710
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:40.010
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet:
You know, for me,

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:42.790
I mean I'm not saying other
people should not do that

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:45.280
but for me that was what
I was interested in.

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:46.580
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Yeah, well I mean one

00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:47.880
of the things that's
interesting is

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:50.140
that when folklorists
approach something

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:54.190
like a French diaspora one
of the tendencies is for them

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:58.990
to try to trace stuff back to
France just because of the,

00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:01.370
sort of valuing things
that are very old.

00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:07.120
If you look at Dewey's early
recordings a lot of the songs

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:09.400
that he did, did have
connections to France

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:12.520
and I wonder if that was
organic to his repertoire

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:15.120
or if it was part
of his recognizing

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:19.540
that that's would play well with
CODOFIL and other organizations

00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:21.030
that were interested in him.

00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:22.340
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet:
Well, I'm not sure

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:23.990
that the second was his motive.

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:26.620
The first was one
of his motives.

00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:31.430
But the other thing, you know,
he was, he was interested

00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:36.880
in what was profoundly
us about those songs.

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:42.540
And a lot of 'us'
was really old stuff.

00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:46.340
He enlisted the help of his
brothers and other people,

00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:53.740
his sisters, his aunts I mean to
mine the family tradition for,

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:56.060
you know, the oldest
songs they could remember,

00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:57.740
sometimes [inaudible] songs
like [foreign language spoken].

00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:05.080
And so he was trying to
reach as far back as he could

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:10.160
but he was also valuing
contemporary creation,

00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:13.730
as long as it seemed
like it was in a flow.

00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:15.030
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:16.330
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: You
know a recognizable flow.

00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:18.760
But what you said
about you know,

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:25.010
sometimes people get stuff
going back to France, we did.

00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:30.400
We did and it was sort of
like a self-defence mechanism.

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:33.030
You know, the French keep
saying that you know,

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:40.500
some of the stuff we
say, is an erosion,

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:42.610
it represents an
erosion of the language.

00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:44.170
But we started looking
into it and it turns

00:34:44.170 --> 00:34:46.520
out they weren't erosions at
all, they were preservations

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:51.650
of the ways things had been,
except that you had to go

00:34:51.650 --> 00:34:53.860
to the exact provinces, you
know [foreign language spoken],

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:57.010
you know those areas where the
original settlers had come from.

00:34:57.010 --> 00:34:59.830
If you go there they still
refer to a coffee pot

00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:01.130
as not [foreign language spoken]

00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:02.850
but [foreign language
spoken] like we do.

00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:06.530
So, and they still, you know
conjugate the imparfait [foreign

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:07.950
language spoken] instead

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:10.000
of [foreign language
spoken] so it wasn't.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.660
We weren't making mistakes
we were preserving the way,

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:18.230
some of the things that we had
inherited from our origins.

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:21.160
And sometimes those were songs.

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:28.110
Now one of the reasons why
the Lomax Collection was

00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:31.920
so profound, it was a watershed
moment when we heard that.

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:35.160
And the reason, one of
the reasons was that up

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:41.140
until then our notion of the
way Cajun music had evolved was

00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:42.760
based on the commercial
recordings.

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:46.290
Those were as far back in
history as we could go.

00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:50.850
And we had been all
profoundly influenced

00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:54.980
by Chris Strachwitz's historical
re-releases, you know going back

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:59.540
to the late 20s and 30s and 40s
and he was sort of putting it

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:01.910
into a sort of historical sweep.

00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:03.850
And it made sense right?

00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:05.150
You know, there was
this early stuff

00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:07.180
and then there was the
swing band influence stuff.

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:10.490
And then there was the war stuff
and the post-war stuff and so

00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:15.600
that made sense and it was
telling a very compelling story.

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:18.830
Then the Lomax Collection,
it was like whoa.

00:36:18.830 --> 00:36:22.540
It was, a lot of the
stuff was way older.

00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:24.080
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:25.540
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet:
It was recorded in '34

00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:30.280
but the Lomaxes were looking for
people who were representative

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:33.800
of pre-commercial
recording stuff.

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:36.450
All of a sudden you
start thinking oh wait,

00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:44.870
man all these ballads, all
of this lyrical treasure

00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:47.970
of lyrics that come from way.

00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:51.480
A lot of this stuff you could
actually connect through Quebec

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.290
and Acadie, all the
way back to France.

00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:58.120
I mean whew, we had to
rethink the whole thing

00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:01.580
and sometimes one of
things that occurred to me

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:06.820
as I was listening to this stuff
was hey, I recognize that theme.

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:08.310
I recognize that
[foreign language spoken].

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:13.930
But in the ballads it
was elaborated with four

00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:17.750
or five verses where
it, you know intricate,

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:21.330
whereas in the dance music
lyrics it had gotten compressed.

00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:25.510
It got tight and compressed
and impressionistic.

00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:28.050
But that's obviously
where it had come from.

00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:29.410
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:32.120
Yeah, so you have the new
compositions actually coming

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:34.630
out of these older traditions
but you hadn't realized it.

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:35.930
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: [Multiple
speakers] or people who were at,

00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:38.110
at least sort of
conceptually aware of them.

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:39.410
They weren't word for word

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:43.540
but they were addressing
the same themes you know.

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:45.540
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: In your
talk you were very eloquent

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:49.560
about new creations
coming in just

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:53.070
as you're saying now is
kind of a, part of a tide

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:55.030
that keeps going, a
river that keeps going.

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:57.160
Could you talk a little bit

00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:59.290
about your contributions
to that?

00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:02.670
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet:
Mine, in what way?

00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:06.280
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Well, I mean,
well talk about Jean Arsenault.

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:08.660
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet:
[Laughter] well,

00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:11.420
you know if you hang out with
those guys long enough you know

00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:13.970
you kind of say I'm
interested in doing that.

00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:15.270
I could do that.

00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:16.570
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: You mean
in actually writing just

00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:17.870
for these [multiple speakers]?

00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:20.360
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: Yeah,
yeah so the first time I did

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:24.070
that was for Wayne Toups.

00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:30.010
He called me one night and said
I've got this song I want to do

00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:32.150
but the lyrics are
in [inaudible].

00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:35.180
I wrote the, you know the lyrics
are written down in English

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:39.570
but you know, my notion
of it is in French.

00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:41.360
Could you come and help me?

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:45.160
So I went and we and I
developed the lyrics for

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:48.460
"Un Amour Secret"
was the first song.

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:51.610
And when I heard that, I had
a moment not unlike Dewey's

00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:52.910
at Newport.

00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:55.760
You know I was in the
studio watching that happen.

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:58.270
The next thing you know
this whole band is playing

00:38:58.270 --> 00:39:01.250
and he's singing lyrics that I
just came up with and I thought,

00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:04.610
I love this, it's
really great [laughter].

00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:07.850
Man this is really cool, so.

00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:10.870
&gt;&gt; Nancy Croce: You did
it as a pseudonym though?

00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:12.170
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: Yeah.

00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:13.470
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Yeah and why,

00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:14.770
please talk a little
bit about that.

00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:16.070
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: And the
pseudonym is older than that.

00:39:16.070 --> 00:39:17.440
You want to hear this?

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:19.150
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah, sure.

00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:22.430
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet:
Jean Arsenault was born

00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:28.560
when Barry Ancelet was 27
years old in Quebec City.

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:33.250
I was in. I was in Quebec

00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:36.410
for [foreign language
spoken] Francophone,

00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:43.000
a large international gathering
of Francophone people hosted

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.460
by the Quebec government.

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:50.620
Quebec used to do this a lot
because I think they wanted

00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:55.420
to sort of reassure themselves
that they weren't alone in this,

00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:58.820
and so they would bring in
Acadians and Louisianans

00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:01.050
and sometimes people
from Missouri,

00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:02.430
other French-speaking, Ontario.

00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:04.350
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah, they
wanted to be sort of the capital

00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:06.080
of French America
in a way, yeah.

00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:07.380
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: Yeah
and they wanted to kind

00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:11.500
of signal we're not alone
in this effort you know.

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:19.580
So, there was this [inaudible]
in 1978 and I was there

00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:23.630
as a. I was there to give
a talk on the integration

00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:28.800
of Louisiana French style of
speaking into the classroom.

00:40:30.570 --> 00:40:39.430
And when I got there we
learned that there had been,

00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:44.880
there was a literary
event, a poetry reading.

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.180
It was called [foreign
language spoken].

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:48.680
It was to be poetry
readings and music.

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:54.850
The part of the music part, the
part of the music side of it

00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:58.760
that they were going to present
was a, the symphony orchestra

00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:05.000
of the City of Quebec was
going to debut a symphony piece

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:10.760
that Claude Levier [phonetic]
had written composed in honor

00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:15.240
of Helene, Samuel
de Champlain's wife.

00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:17.820
So there was a symphony
orchestra onstage

00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:20.180
and there were these poets.

00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:22.810
Quebec had a long
history, Gaston Miron

00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:26.670
and Michel Alon [phonetic] and
all of these, a long history

00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:35.230
of poetry used as
social fuel to,

00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:42.030
you know protest being
drowned out, to protest,

00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:46.350
like Michel Alon's
[inaudible] you know that kind.

00:41:46.350 --> 00:41:47.920
So they were having
this literary event

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:50.510
and we learned upon arriving
there that they had forgotten

00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:53.410
to integrate, to include
Louisiana and it was like a,

00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:56.960
like a gaffe, you
know, what can we do?

00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:01.100
Well, nobody in Louisiana
at that point, that I knew,

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:02.750
was writing poetry in French.

00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:06.040
I mean there were people
who had written songs

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:09.180
and Zachary Richard,
my dear friend

00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:15.300
from home had written some
new songs but I don't know

00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:18.060
that anybody would have
thought of it as poetry.

00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:27.210
It was but, so I'm talking to
the organiser of this thing,

00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:30.640
Marcel Dube and he
says well you know,

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:32.800
this is a terrible you
know embarrassment.

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.460
We have to include Louisiana.

00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:41.430
Well, it turns out that I had
written a few poems in reaction

00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:46.680
to a woman that I had met
earlier that year in Moncton,

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:51.640
originally from Quebec but
she was living in Moncton.

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:54.060
I'd kind of been smitten by her

00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:56.010
and I wrote a few
things about her.

00:42:56.010 --> 00:43:02.670
And her name was Louise and
there was an opportunity to sort

00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:08.850
of make a confluence of Louise
and Louisiana, as you know,

00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:10.750
a potential mistress
that you're.

00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:12.630
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Muse, muse.

00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:13.930
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet:
You know your muse

00:43:13.930 --> 00:43:16.310
that you're smitten by, so it
was like a. It was like being

00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:19.970
in love in your place, so
there was a confluence.

00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:25.030
So, I didn't want to
force his hand and I was.

00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:28.890
After we finished this thing
in Quebec I was on my way back

00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:32.030
over there to see
if that was going,

00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:33.590
how that was going to play out.

00:43:33.590 --> 00:43:36.720
So I had these things
I had written about her

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:40.890
but I hadn't intended to show
anybody but he's pressing me

00:43:40.890 --> 00:43:44.980
so I said well, I
have this friend.

00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:47.780
I didn't want to
press, force his hand.

00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:52.290
I said I have a friend who
has written a few things and.

00:43:52.290 --> 00:43:53.590
He said [inaudible].

00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:56.500
I said I happen to have some
here and so I showed him.

00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:58.440
And he said who is this?

00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:01.520
I said his name is
Jean Arsenault.

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:04.590
My name is Barry Jean Ancelet

00:44:04.590 --> 00:44:08.460
and my grandmother was
[inaudible] Arsenault so I was.

00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:11.150
I mean right there
as fast as that.

00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:12.450
He reads the stuff.

00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:13.750
He says oh, this is
perfect, perfect.

00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:15.050
You'll read this.

00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:16.350
You'll read this.

00:44:16.350 --> 00:44:17.650
Call him and ask
him for permission.

00:44:17.650 --> 00:44:20.640
So, he hands me a phone.

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:21.940
This is 1978.

00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:25.030
This is before cell phones or
answering machines or anything.

00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:27.490
So I called the number
at my apartment

00:44:27.490 --> 00:44:30.160
in Lafayette knowing
nobody was there.

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:31.460
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right, right.

00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:32.760
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet:
And I had a conversation

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:35.110
with Jean Arsenault as the
phone was ringing in my ear,

00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:38.480
to get his permission
because now then, I was caught

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:41.950
in my lie, to get his
permission to do this.

00:44:41.950 --> 00:44:45.240
So, I hung up and I
said he said it's okay.

00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:47.100
So he said well you'll
read this.

00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:50.730
And then I thought wait
Zachary Richard is here.

00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:53.360
He's here to perform
in a concert.

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:58.730
He had a bit hit so I
went over to where his,

00:44:58.730 --> 00:45:01.090
where the concert
setting was going to be

00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:02.390
and the [foreign
language spoken]

00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:09.480
and Zachary Richard already by
then was a big thing in Quebec.

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:13.510
It would be like going to
some, you know, big festival

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:14.810
in England and say
hey, I need to talk

00:45:14.810 --> 00:45:16.570
to Mick Jagger, like
yeah, right.

00:45:16.570 --> 00:45:17.870
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
I'm his friend

00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:19.170
from home [laughter] right.

00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:20.470
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet:
I was like yeah like,

00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:22.370
so I told the guard there.

00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:24.610
I said [foreign language
spoken] and he said you

00:45:24.610 --> 00:45:25.910
and about 500 other people.

00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:27.210
I said no, no, no I really.

00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:29.690
No, he said yeah, the
same 500 other people.

00:45:29.690 --> 00:45:34.600
But while we're talking over
his shoulder I see Ralph,

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:37.250
Zackary Richard come out of
his [foreign language spoken]

00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:44.510
trailer and I knew because you
know he went by Zachary Richard

00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:45.810
but we all called him Ralph.

00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:47.110
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:45:47.110 --> 00:45:48.410
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet:
From back home,

00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:50.550
so I knew the only way I could
get his attention was I yelled

00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:51.850
'hey Ralph'.

00:45:51.850 --> 00:45:54.630
He turned around and he said,
oh, what are you doing here?

00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:56.370
And he told the security,
let him in.

00:45:56.370 --> 00:45:59.240
And the security guard
[inaudible] let me in.

00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:00.780
And I said look,
here's the deal.

00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:05.690
They want us to participate in
this literary thing, evening.

00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:08.630
And I got one thing but
I need something else.

00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:12.540
Do you have any songs that
you haven't yet recorded

00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:15.290
that we could claim as poetry?

00:46:15.290 --> 00:46:16.670
He said yeah, I have
a few things.

00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:18.920
So we picked Le Ballade de
[foreign language spoken]

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:22.460
and those are the two things
that I read that night.

00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:27.190
And there were about 3000
people in the courtyard

00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:29.890
of the [foreign language
spoken] in Quebec.

00:46:29.890 --> 00:46:32.310
I'd never experienced
anything like that in my life.

00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:35.280
I couldn't have dreamed it.

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:39.810
And I got a standing
ovation I guess in large part

00:46:39.810 --> 00:46:41.500
because people were
so astonished

00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:45.450
that this existed
in Louisiana at all.

00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:47.560
But I was really, I had a
moment like [inaudible] oh man,

00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:53.850
so when I got back home and I
called Ralph, Zachary Richard.

00:46:53.850 --> 00:46:57.300
I said man you're not going
to believe what happened.

00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:00.830
I read these things and
he said yeah, I know,

00:47:00.830 --> 00:47:02.130
this happens to me all the time.

00:47:02.130 --> 00:47:03.630
I said no, but you're
singing, it's different.

00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:05.450
When you're singing
it's different.

00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:07.900
I was just speaking these words

00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:11.310
and it electrified the
whole place and me too.

00:47:11.310 --> 00:47:13.540
He said okay.

00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:15.100
I said we have to do this here.

00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:16.400
It was the same principle.

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:17.950
We have to do this here.

00:47:17.950 --> 00:47:19.620
So we organized a series

00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:22.080
of [foreign language
spoken] music in Lafayette.

00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:23.380
And I had had so much fun

00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:28.410
with Jean Arsenault I
elected to keep him around.

00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:33.920
And so all of the literary
things that I wrote

00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:37.130
and published on some
lyrics, stories, whatever,

00:47:37.130 --> 00:47:40.730
I published under the
pseudonym of Jean Arsenault.

00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:42.810
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And how
many collections did you,

00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:46.290
did you publish or under
that name [inaudible]?

00:47:46.290 --> 00:47:51.320
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet:
Oh, six or seven

00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:52.840
and a lot of song lyrics.

00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:54.140
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:55.440
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: All
of the song lyrics I did

00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:58.450
for Wayne Toups and Richard
LeBouef and Steve Riley

00:47:58.450 --> 00:48:01.630
and even D.L. Menard
and a few other people,

00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:04.320
they were all done
under Jean Arsenault.

00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:07.620
And Floyd Soileau
with Swallow Records

00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:11.390
in Louisiana said you need to
tell people who you are man.

00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:15.120
I said no man, this is so
much fun, I'm having a blast.

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:17.890
Because Jean Arsenault, when
Jean Arsenault would show

00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:19.190
up for a poetry reading

00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:22.540
or a performance he could
look really different.

00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:26.470
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: [Laughter]
no one can tell it's you?

00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:27.770
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: I often,

00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:30.060
I would often wear
a Mardi Gras mask.

00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:31.360
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Did
your colleagues

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:32.830
at the university know
you were [inaudible]?

00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:34.130
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet:
Yeah, yeah,

00:48:34.130 --> 00:48:35.430
I mean it was this,
in a way it was.

00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:37.100
After a while it was
the worst-kept secret

00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:39.870
in French Louisiana but
never the less it was fun

00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:45.400
because it was kind of
like having a stage persona

00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:49.930
that was able to play out
there where there was no stage.

00:48:49.930 --> 00:48:51.420
It would be used in real life.

00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:53.580
You know Jean Arsenault
could show up in.

00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:55.630
And the other thing
about Jean Arsenault was

00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:59.240
that Jean Arsenault never
had to worry about English.

00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:01.000
He never had to deal
with English.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:05.040
He was exclusively
French-speaking, right.

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:09.670
One time when I was doing
the KRVS Morning Show

00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:11.810
that Pete Bergeron
does now from 6

00:49:11.810 --> 00:49:17.270
to 7:30 I did an interview
with Jean Arsenault.

00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:18.650
I would just.

00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:20.840
I would just ask a
question and then answer it.

00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:22.350
And you know I didn't
even change my voice.

00:49:22.350 --> 00:49:24.340
I just asked a question
and then answered it.

00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:26.670
And some people started
calling the studio and said hey,

00:49:26.670 --> 00:49:27.970
I want to talk to that guy.

00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:29.440
He wrote the lyrics
to a Wayne Toups.

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:31.090
He said I want to talk to
you to see if he could.

00:49:31.090 --> 00:49:35.860
I said well hold
on a second, hello?

00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:37.160
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And no
one, no one could tell?

00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:38.460
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: It
was so much fun you know.

00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:39.760
&gt;&gt; Stephine Winick:
That's fun, that's great.

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:42.330
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And you
started performing as him also?

00:49:42.330 --> 00:49:44.540
Are you singing now?

00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:46.940
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: Well,
Sam Brousard convinced me

00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:49.610
to use my real name on that CD.

00:49:49.610 --> 00:49:51.710
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Yeah, talk
a little bit about the CD.

00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:53.240
The title of the CD was?

00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:54.560
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet:
"Broken Promised Land".

00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:55.860
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And
when did that come out?

00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:57.160
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: Which
was based on The Promised Land

00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:59.030
where Ben [inaudible] was
[inaudible] tell the stories.

00:49:59.030 --> 00:50:00.660
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And
when did that come out?

00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:06.750
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: A couple
of years ago and what is 2016.

00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:09.860
And I didn't even know
we were making a CD.

00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:13.190
I thought we were just
goofing around in Sam's studio.

00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:14.490
He had a studio at home.

00:50:14.490 --> 00:50:15.790
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:50:15.790 --> 00:50:17.090
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: I had
written a bunch of lyrics.

00:50:17.090 --> 00:50:22.050
He started putting them to
music and at one point he said,

00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:23.920
hey I want you to
sing on some of these.

00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:25.610
Like really?

00:50:25.610 --> 00:50:28.240
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Had
you sung before?

00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:30.520
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet:
Happy Birthday and,

00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:33.730
no I used to sing a
little bit at The Liberty,

00:50:33.730 --> 00:50:36.220
you know I would sing
every once in a while.

00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:39.780
I sang with The Wandering
Aces, Lionel LeLieux

00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:41.880
and Don Montoucet
for a little while.

00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:45.300
I used to have a little bit of a
voice, I don't have one anymore.

00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:48.680
I told that to Sam, I said all
I've got is this gravely thing

00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:51.000
and he said that's
all you need for this

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.060
because it's our bluesy stuff.

00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:58.160
Anyway we recorded, but I
thought we were just playing

00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:02.540
and after about ten
songs he says, you know,

00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:03.840
what are we going
to do with this?

00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:05.940
What are we going
to do with what?

00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:08.100
He said well, we've
got ten songs.

00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:12.450
Really, okay, what could we?

00:51:12.450 --> 00:51:13.750
He said we could put out a CD.

00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:15.120
I said how would we do that?

00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:18.640
Well, he said we
could do it ourselves.

00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:21.790
I said uh uh, I don't want
to be in the CD business.

00:51:21.790 --> 00:51:24.000
He said, well let's pitch
it to somebody and see

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.300
if they will put it out?

00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:26.600
And, so we talked

00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:27.900
to Joe Alsalvor [phonetic]
first, about it.

00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:29.200
He said he was too busy.

00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:31.420
So I went over to Phil Blatt
[phonetic] and talked to Floyd

00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:33.910
and Chris Soileau about it.

00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:35.210
I've got to tell you.

00:51:35.210 --> 00:51:39.650
I went in there with all
ten songs and he said.

00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:42.480
I said Floyd, Floyd and
I have known each other

00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:43.780
for a long time.

00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:45.450
I said Floyd, I've got to
tell you before you hear this,

00:51:45.450 --> 00:51:47.960
I said it's different,
like real different.

00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:49.260
He said it's okay.

00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:50.560
I could do different.

00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:54.100
Okay, so he starts
listening to it

00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:57.420
and listen you all, I'm serious.

00:51:57.420 --> 00:51:58.800
I'm not making this up.

00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:03.580
They listened to all ten songs
in a row with not a word.

00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:10.770
I was like, oh man, this
is a train wreck, whoa.

00:52:10.770 --> 00:52:12.340
And at the end of the,

00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:16.120
in the tenth song
pushes the pause button

00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:19.690
and he says well Ancelet,

00:52:19.690 --> 00:52:22.080
when you said it was
different you weren't kidding.

00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:25.560
But he said I'll tell you
what we're going to put this

00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:28.150
out because I don't
want to be the joker

00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:30.560
that didn't put this out.

00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:35.710
So he puts this out on Swallow
Records, sort of routinely.

00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:40.310
You know they send most
of the stuff that they put

00:52:40.310 --> 00:52:44.240
out in a year for
consideration for the Grammys.

00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:46.190
The damn thing gets nominated.

00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:47.490
I thought.

00:52:47.490 --> 00:52:48.790
I got that call one morning.

00:52:48.790 --> 00:52:50.090
I was still in bed.

00:52:50.090 --> 00:52:51.710
This voice said you know your CD
has been nominated for a Grammy.

00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:54.070
I said, what are you saying?

00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:55.370
What are you saying?

00:52:55.370 --> 00:52:57.330
And they said yeah, no kidding,
in the Regional Roots category.

00:52:57.330 --> 00:52:59.220
I thought oh man.

00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:00.850
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And if
I'm not mistaken it was

00:53:00.850 --> 00:53:03.050
up against one of Joelle's
[phonetic] projects.

00:53:03.050 --> 00:53:05.360
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: Yeah and
I participated on that one too

00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:06.880
so I was double-nominated
that year.

00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:08.180
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
But I bet he was sorry

00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:10.820
that he hadn't said yes
to you at that point.

00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:12.790
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet:
[Laughter] he might have been.

00:53:12.790 --> 00:53:14.120
Yeah, we were competing with,

00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:16.250
Eddie and Roddy Ramirez'
[phonetic] album was also.

00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:17.850
We were three from Louisiana.

00:53:17.850 --> 00:53:19.660
We diluted our own
vote but that's okay.

00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:22.230
You know I felt like being
nominated, I won anyway.

00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:24.160
They gave me a medal
and everything.

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:25.460
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah,

00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:27.100
that's a great [inaudible]
just a great acknowledgement

00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:28.480
for what you've done
over the years

00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:30.010
and for the culture in general.

00:53:30.010 --> 00:53:32.300
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: Okay but
it was more of a surprise to me.

00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:33.600
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Yeah [laughter].

00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:35.040
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: I think
nobody was more surprised

00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:36.340
than me.

00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:37.640
Sam was not surprised.

00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:38.940
He thought he had.

00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:40.790
He thought, you know, this
is, you know different

00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:43.020
and an important step.

00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:44.320
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:45.750
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet:
Interestingly I've got to say

00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:49.010
over the last four, five,

00:53:49.010 --> 00:53:54.050
six years I have seen the
[inaudible] steadily rising

00:53:54.050 --> 00:53:58.420
on new production [foreign
language spoken] The Lost

00:53:58.420 --> 00:53:59.990
Bayou Ramblers.

00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:03.180
I mean it's amazing what's
happening, what's coming

00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:04.600
out of South Louisiana
right now.

00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:09.090
And one of the amazing
things is the quality of it,

00:54:09.090 --> 00:54:13.770
the cleverness of it, you
know but another thing is

00:54:13.770 --> 00:54:15.660
that it's still in French.

00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:16.960
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:18.330
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: It's
still coming out in French like,

00:54:18.330 --> 00:54:22.340
I'm happy about that but I'm
you know kind of surprised.

00:54:22.340 --> 00:54:23.880
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: One of
the things that we love

00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:26.100
about it here at the library
and I know you've talked

00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:29.580
about this a lot and will
continue to talk about it,

00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:33.840
is the fact that those groups
are still using our archival

00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:35.730
resources as their inspiration.

00:54:35.730 --> 00:54:37.030
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet:
Absolutely.

00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:38.330
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: That
is they're recording just

00:54:38.330 --> 00:54:41.320
like Michael Doucet was doing
25 years ago or 30 years ago

00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:44.680
and Steve Riley was doing
20 years and 15 years ago.

00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:47.480
They're doing it now and
recording versions of our songs.

00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:48.780
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet:
You know why,

00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:52.340
you know why Michael
Doucet was the first?

00:54:52.340 --> 00:54:54.770
Because he got, he got
the jump on the project

00:54:54.770 --> 00:54:58.360
because when I brought back
the Lomax copies to home,

00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:01.710
to the university, he
and I were sitting side

00:55:01.710 --> 00:55:04.350
by side listening to the tape.

00:55:04.350 --> 00:55:05.900
There were 11 reels.

00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:08.020
We put on the first
one, started listening.

00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:13.700
It was Wilfred Charles,
a jure singer but he was

00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:16.450
by himself from New Iberia.

00:55:16.450 --> 00:55:21.110
He got through that song and
he was singing about the Zydeco

00:55:21.110 --> 00:55:24.960
in 1934 but whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:26.680
I pushed the pause button
and I turned to Michael

00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:28.590
and I said man, we're
going to have

00:55:28.590 --> 00:55:31.020
to rethink everything
we thought we knew.

00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:32.750
The whole, it's a game-changer.

00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:34.470
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Because
it was so much earlier

00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:35.770
than [multiple speakers]?

00:55:35.770 --> 00:55:37.290
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: It
was represented so much

00:55:37.290 --> 00:55:39.230
at an earlier tradition.

00:55:39.230 --> 00:55:41.700
That first song that guy
was singing about Zydeco

00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:45.080
and everybody said
Zydeco emerged in the 50s.

00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:47.080
Well what was he doing
singing about in '34?

00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:48.820
And he wasn't the only one,
there were two other songs.

00:55:48.820 --> 00:55:50.980
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right, there
were some other ones yeah, yeah.

00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:52.280
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: And
then we started hearing all

00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:54.660
that Hoffpower stuff and you
know the stuff that's coming

00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:56.520
out of New Iberia and the
stuff coming out of Crowley.

00:55:56.520 --> 00:56:02.630
It's like whoa the
lyrical richness

00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:04.300
that we were hearing
was stunning.

00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:05.740
So what do I do?

00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:09.240
I start thinking okay,
how do we keep this going?

00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:14.600
Lomax had said, Alan and/or
John had said as a tagline,

00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:17.840
on a number of those cuts,
you know we're recording this

00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:20.230
for the Library of Congress
so that it will be available

00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:22.490
to musicians in the
future about it to learn.

00:56:22.490 --> 00:56:23.790
I said well let's see that.

00:56:23.790 --> 00:56:25.090
Let's do that.

00:56:25.090 --> 00:56:26.390
So I started calling people in.

00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:28.880
I said hey, do you want to
hear something interesting?

00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:30.430
Michael had started
doing it already

00:56:30.430 --> 00:56:32.390
and people were asking him,
where did you get that?

00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:33.850
Well, it's in a Lomax cut.

00:56:33.850 --> 00:56:35.150
Really, where is that?

00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:37.210
So they were coming
to the archives,

00:56:37.210 --> 00:56:39.780
musicians [inaudible]
can I hear that?

00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:42.720
And they were starting to
pick songs and recycle them,

00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:48.270
my Old Playboys [inaudible],
I mean you name it, Ann Savoy

00:56:48.270 --> 00:56:50.590
and James Dream [phonetic],
a number of people.

00:56:50.590 --> 00:56:55.390
So the next thing you know
there's all this bubbling

00:56:55.390 --> 00:56:56.960
of brand new/old songs.

00:56:56.960 --> 00:56:58.260
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:56:58.260 --> 00:57:00.830
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Well, it's
great for you to bring it back

00:57:00.830 --> 00:57:06.650
to the library today and
to give us an overview

00:57:06.650 --> 00:57:07.950
of what you've been doing,

00:57:07.950 --> 00:57:09.300
what's been going
on in the area.

00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:11.120
We could go on for hours
but I think we need

00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:12.420
to [multiple speakers].

00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:13.720
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: But
I want to say by the way

00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:15.020
that on the record, I
want to say on the record

00:57:15.020 --> 00:57:16.320
that the Library of Congress,

00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:19.930
the American Folklife Center has
been so generous and supportive

00:57:19.930 --> 00:57:23.620
of all of this and enabled
so much of this to happen.

00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:26.300
We appreciate what you
all have done for us.

00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:27.960
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Well, we
absolutely appreciate everything

00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:29.870
that you've done for the music.

00:57:29.870 --> 00:57:32.110
One last point that
I'll make is I've worked

00:57:32.110 --> 00:57:36.590
with those Louisiana
collections and the cataloguing,

00:57:36.590 --> 00:57:37.910
the additional cataloguing

00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:39.770
that you guys have
done is actually better

00:57:39.770 --> 00:57:42.970
than what was done here in the
30s and 40s so there are songs

00:57:42.970 --> 00:57:44.940
that we can find out
about [laughter] that are

00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:46.870
in our collections
that we can only find

00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:48.170
out about through your work.

00:57:48.170 --> 00:57:49.470
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet:
Josh Caffrey,

00:57:49.470 --> 00:57:50.840
Josh Caffrey did an
amazingly meticulous job.

00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:52.140
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Absolutely.

00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:53.440
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet: Of
identifying some of this stuff

00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:54.740
and finding out information

00:57:54.740 --> 00:57:56.810
about the backstories
a lot times.

00:57:56.810 --> 00:58:00.690
I mean I had started that
ball kind of you know

00:58:00.690 --> 00:58:03.360
in discovering a few things
and then Josh, you know,

00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:05.720
took the hand off and
ran for a touchdown.

00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:07.410
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: We keep his
book in the Reading Room as one

00:58:07.410 --> 00:58:09.840
of our basic resources
when people come in to talk

00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:14.980
about that material so, yeah, so
thank you so much for the talk.

00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:16.280
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet:
Oh, a pleasure.

00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:17.580
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And for
talking to us in this interview.

00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:18.880
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: [Inaudible]
to Washington, yes.

00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:20.180
It's been a lovely.

00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:21.480
&gt;&gt; Barry Jean Ancelet:
I've enjoyed it, thank you.
