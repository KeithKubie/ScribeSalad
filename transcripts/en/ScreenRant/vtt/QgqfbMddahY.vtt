00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:09.860
Making a movie is by no means an easy process.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.280
In any given production, meticulous directors
and conscientious actors want the final product

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.020
to be as good as it can possibly be - and
that can often result in some scenes taking

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.820
tens or even hundreds of takes to perfect.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.669
Actors can mess up their lines, the lighting
might not be right, something could go wrong

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:27.439
with a stunt and all manner of other problems
can arise - especially when filming a particularly

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:28.590
complex scene.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.460
However, sometimes, even the most difficult-to-film
and most memorable of scenes can be successfully

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.180
performed in a single attempt - and that's
what this video is all about.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.770
Here are ten amazing movie scenes that were
nailed on the first take.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.570
The Dark Knight
The late Heath Ledger famously won a posthumous

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.560
Oscar for his role as The Joker in 2008's
The Dark Knight - and this particular scene

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.420
epitomises exactly why.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.120
It's the scene in which the villain blows
up Gotham City hospital - and Ledger totally

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.739
nailed it first time, in spite of the fact
that he encountered difficulties during the

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:58.739
filming of it.

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.729
Ledger was holding a device to activate the
explosives that were to blow the building

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:03.519
up, but they didn't go off as planned at first.

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.020
So, while remaining in character, he fiddled
with the device for a while until the explosives

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.240
detonated - and that's the scene that made
it into the final movie.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.070
Alien: Resurrection
Alien: Resurrection was pretty terrible.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.070
The fourth installment in the Alien franchise
had very little going for it, but one particular

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.869
scene was extremely memorable.

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.579
It was the scene in which Sigourney Weaver's
Ellen Ripley Clone 8 was able to score a basketball

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:28.479
whilst facing away from the hoop - a shot
with a success rate of about one in six - and

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:29.870
she did it in just one take.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.140
She'd trained with a pro basketball coach
for two weeks prior to the shot, but director

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.189
Jean-Pierre Jeunet still wanted to cheat by
dropping the ball in the hoop from out of

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:37.189
shot.

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.000
However, Weaver believed she could pull it
off and that's exactly what she did - and

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.980
even Ron Perlman's genuinely shocked and out-of-character
look couldn't stop the scene from making it

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.930
in to the final movie.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.869
Hunger
Hunger - a 2008 movie about the 1981 Irish

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.860
hunger strike - starred Michael Fassbender
as hunger striker Bobby Sands and Liam Cunningham

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.520
as a priest named Father Dominic Moran.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.719
There's a fifteen minute discussion about
the strike between the pair, while they're

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:00.860
both sat at a table, that only took one take
to get right.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.009
Apparently, Cunningham moved in with Fassbender
for several weeks and rehearsed the scene

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.009
up to fifteen times a day to perfect it - and
the result was a very captivating and emotional

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.870
scene that was accomplished brilliantly at
the first attempt.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.030
Poltergeist
The conclusion of 1982's classic horror movie

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.840
Poltergeist saw the Freeling family's home
implode and get sucked into a portal that

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.170
had opened in one of the bedrooms.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.629
In order to produce this scene, a six-foot
model scale of the home was constructed, which

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:27.209
took four months of hard work.

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.530
After brainstorming numerous methods of putting
the shot into practise, the special effects

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.950
team decided that the best way to do it was
by threading thick cables through the model

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.150
and to simply pull it into a funnel attached
to a high powered vacuum - they pulled it

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.540
off in a single take.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.760
After the model destruction shot was completed,
it then took two months of additional special

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.640
effects work to perfect the final shot.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.150
Boogie Nights
The brilliant Boogie Nights tells the stories

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.150
of a number of characters and the film's opening
shot goes straight from the opening title

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.790
of the film to introducing several of them.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.410
It follows characters like Julianne Moore's
Maggie, Burt Reynold's Jack Horner and Luis

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.489
Guzman's Maurice Rodriguez into a lively and
popular nightclub, circling and meandering

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.500
through it seamlessly whilst introducing the
rest of the main cast.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.340
The framing, lighting and timing had to be
extremely precise - and it was - and, astonishingly,

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.480
it was nailed perfectly at the first attempt.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.409
Director Paul Thomas Anderson loves this kind
of shot - and this is arguably his greatest

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:17.310
example.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.680
Titanic
In James Cameron's epic 1997 romance-disaster

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.840
movie Titanic, after the ill-fated titular
ship had crashed into the iceberg and started

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.769
to sink, there was a memorable scene in which
water crashed into the vessel's Grand Staircase

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:30.769
room.

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.160
Due to the fact that the entire set and its
furnishings were going to be destroyed in

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.549
the scene in question, the film makers were
only actually allowed a single opportunity

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:37.549
to get it right.

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:40.740
Thankfully, they totally nailed it, and the
scene you see in the movie is indeed that

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.650
one take they were afforded.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.120
Children of Men
Children of Men is a 2006 movie about a dystopian

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.370
future in which society is on the brink of
collapse, due to two decades of human infertility.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.060
It's set in a dog-eat-dog world in which chaos
is the norm - and one such example of that

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.430
chaos is when the main characters' car is
ambushed.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.851
It's a complicated scene that sees the characters
played by Clive Owen, Julianne Moore and Chiwetel

00:04:01.851 --> 00:04:03.080
Ejiofor attacked by an armed gang.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.219
There's a burning car blocking their path,
there's a motorcycle chase, there's a gunshot

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:09.239
that kills Moore's Julian Taylor and there's
a violent exchange with a group of police

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.500
officers - and it was all done in a single
take.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.560
A splatter of blood on the camera lens threatened
to ruin it, but director Alfonso CuarÃ³n was

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.230
convinced to keep it in the final movie by
cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.870
Primer
Trying to explain Primer in detail in such

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.669
a short video would be impossible, but in
a nutshell it's essentially a movie about

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:29.810
the accidental discovery of time-travel.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.850
It's extremely convoluted and it has a very
experimental plot structure - which makes

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.699
the fact that it was almost entirely filmed
in single takes all the more impressive.

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:41.259
The movie's budget was only $7,000, so its
writer, director and leading man Shane Carruth

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:44.009
only had enough money to buy just the right
amount of celluloid to shoot it on.

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:47.030
There was barely any room for error and he
successfully pulled it off - and you have

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.919
to give him huge props for doing so.

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.570
Russian Ark
2002's Russian Ark - a historical drama directed

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.740
by Alexander Sokurov - goes one better than
Primer, in the sense that the entire movie

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:59.830
was filmed in a single take.

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.750
You didnt mishear that - the entirety of this
ninety-six minute movie was filmed in a single

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:04.750
take.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.250
To put into perspective what an astonishing
feat this was, the movie moves through thirty-three

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.020
rooms of the Russian State Hermitage Museum
it is set in, it contains more than two-thousand

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.880
actors and it utilised three orchestras.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.620
While it wasn't a huge commerical success,
it has understandably garnered widespread

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.111
critical acclaim and a documentary about its
creation was made, called In One Breath, which

00:05:22.111 --> 00:05:24.750
is definitely worth checking out.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:30.490
127 Hours
Danny Boyle's masterful 127 Hours tells the

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.389
true story of Aron Ralston - played by James
Franco in the movie - who managed to get his

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:38.160
arm trapped underneath a boulder at the bottom
a remote canyon in Utah while he was out hiking

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.160
alone.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.080
After more than five days of being stuck,
Ralston was forced to amputate his own arm

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.490
using a blunt knife in order to escape and
avoid an inevitable early death.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.940
It was the most memorable and excruciating
scene in the entire movie - and Franco pulled

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.180
it off in a single take.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.860
The actor cut through a realistic prosthetic
arm in the scene, which was expected to take

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.729
around a day and half - but it actually only
took him twenty minutes.

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:00.300
