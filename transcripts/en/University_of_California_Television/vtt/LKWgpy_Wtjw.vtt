00:00:01.269 --> 00:00:04.186
(electronic beeps)

00:00:06.227 --> 00:00:09.060
(energetic music)

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:15.260
- This is our...

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.070
opening of our symposium today

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.070
sponsored by our local Kavli
Institute for Brain and Mind,

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.860
which is very generously
supported by the Kavli Foundation.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.250
There are a variety of these institutes

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.360
that are around the country

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.430
and the unique Southern
California version of this is

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.150
as you can see our KIBM,

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.870
bridges disciplinary boundaries
to further understanding

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.740
of the origins, evolution, and
mechanisms of human cognition

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.740
relating neural mechanism to behavior.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.880
I'm fortunate to share the
directorship with Nick Spitzer

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.160
and our Co-Director Ralph Greenspan.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.160
So in addition to the support
from the Kavli Foundation,

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.580
in this aggregate underneath the KIBM

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.380
is the Center for Brain Activity Mapping,

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.140
and the California Brain:

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.810
a Neurotechnology Program of California,

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.670
and the San Diego Brain Consortium,

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.650
all of which Ralph has been
organizing and putting together

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.050
and we've aggregated
them under a single head

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.020
though they have independent functions

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.770
and activities throughout the year.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.600
In general, the Kavli Foundation has been

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.840
as I said very generously
supporting research.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.390
They are dedicated to
the advances of science.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.300
Fred Kavli's vision was a
dedication to advanced science

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.940
and benefit of humanity,

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.620
promoting public understanding
of scientific research,

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.170
and support of scientists and their work.

00:01:49.769 --> 00:01:51.730
It's a real international program.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.160
They have five major
areas that they focus on

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.300
including astrophysics,
theoretical physics,

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.450
nanoscience, and neuroscience.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.490
And in addition to meetings and institutes

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.800
that are supported by the Foundation

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.100
there are a series of prizes

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.380
that are given on a regular basis

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.580
that I think some of
you are familiar with.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.490
The president of that
organization is Bob Conn

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.570
who we've known for a while.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.100
Miyoung Chun is the
Executive Vice President

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.070
of Science Programs,

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.410
and James Cohen is the
Director of Communications.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.760
We have two representatives,
Chris Martin and Syl Albin

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.336
are here representing the Kavli Foundation

00:02:31.336 --> 00:02:35.500
and will be participating
today and in tomorrow's meeting

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.050
so thanks very much for coming.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.000
I want to start by acknowledging

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.750
some of the people that have
really made this happen.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.380
This is our, we call our KIBM staff

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.360
but really as some of you can see

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.400
that attend these regularly

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.510
this is sort of a hybrid
of our CARTA meetings

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.370
together with our KIBM meetings.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.430
So, Ingrid Benirschke-Perkins,
Rachel Emens,

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.320
Kate Kaya, Kristen Michener, Linda Nelson,

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.760
Jesse Robie and Janet Shin.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.950
We're being filmed, well,
I'm being filmed currently

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.840
but speakers will be filmed by UCSD-TV

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.620
and that'll be able to be
visualized at a later time point

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.700
in a modified version.

00:03:21.274 --> 00:03:26.274
Rich Wargo is the Science
Producer, Matt Alioto is...

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.930
and Marci Bates and Jacob
Parker make this happen.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.710
I'm very happy to introduce
Kent Schnoeker and Mike Jeffs

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.340
who are our local soft media folks.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.780
So we have two...

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.440
Nick and I generally
search out two experts

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.460
in a field of interest
that we've identified

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.700
to help put together
an outstanding program

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:52.933
and we were lucky enough to have

00:03:52.933 --> 00:03:57.170
Jennifer Lippincott-Schwartz
and Mark Ellisman

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.170
to agree to put together this
unusually good meeting today

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.680
and they will be chairing
the first and second session

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.320
which are, you have the
programs in your hand.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.630
So without any further ado,

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.710
I'm going to ask Jennifer to come up

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.330
and give us just a very
brief introduction to the,

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.110
our title and our objectives

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.560
and then she'll chair the session.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.393
Jennifer?

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.760
- Thank you very much, Rusty.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.410
And I just wanna say how
delighted Mark Ellisman and I are

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.410
to have the opportunity to
co-chair this symposium today.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.430
I mean it was a real delight

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.000
and we heard from Rusty and
Nick that we were chosen to pick

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.670
out of the whole world the
people who really define

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:53.260
this field of imaging
brain and neurobiology.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.720
So that way that Mark, and Mark,

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.560
why don't you come over just
so that everybody can see.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.620
This is my...
- Can I get close to you?

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.390
- Sure. (audience laughs) Exactly.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.990
So, the way Mark and I really

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.240
went about choosing people
to be part of this symposium

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.980
was to cross scales of imaging

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.980
from looking at the
ultra-structure of brain slices,

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.380
to an intermediate level where
one's looking at organelles

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.920
and intercellular communication

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.920
all the way up to tissue
and brain in-vivo imaging.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.810
We've also invited people who analyze

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.530
these data sets, these huge data sets

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.630
from the in-vivo brain imaging experiments

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:49.040
and finally, and in many
ways most importantly,

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.500
we've invited two
scientists who are pioneers

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.850
in the development of tools
that all of us are using

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.892
for doing this type of
imaging of the brain.

00:06:00.892 --> 00:06:03.475
(upbeat music)
