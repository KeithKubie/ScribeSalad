JORDAN THIBODEAU:
Ryan Holiday is

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.820
a media strategist
and prominent writer

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.620
on strategy and business.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.450
After dropping out
of college at 19

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.450
to apprentice under
Robert Greene, author

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.124
of "The 48 Hours of Power".

00:00:17.124 --> 00:00:18.540
He served as
director of marketing

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.060
at American Apparel
for many years.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.710
He has written,
"Trust Me, I'm Lying--

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.590
Confessions of a Media
Manipulator," "Growth Hacker

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.470
Marketing," "The Obstacle is the
Way," and "Ego is the Enemy."

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.890
So please join me in
welcoming Ryan Holiday.

00:00:37.584 --> 00:00:38.250
All right, Ryan.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.010
So for my first question--

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.430
it's a good interrogation--
so what is the ego

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.900
and how can it get in
the way of our success?

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.360
RYAN HOLIDAY: I'm not talking
about the Freudian ego, which

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.200
is probably sort of above
my pay grade to talk about.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.810
I'm talking about sort
of the colloquial ego.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.522
I guess I'm talking about
the Trumpian ego, right?

00:01:01.522 --> 00:01:03.480
When you think you're
better than everyone else

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.510
and you think you
have all the answers.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.250
When your sense of your
own skills or values

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.759
far outstrip the reality of
your situation, I would say.

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:18.300
There's a line from
Bill Walsh-- he's

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.820
saying ego is when
competence becomes arrogance.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.840
So I think it's that line
where you're not just

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.430
competent in what you're doing.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.350
You think that you are
God's gift to humanity.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.790
And I'm not saying that everyone
is an egomaniac and only

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.970
egomaniacs need to sort of
think about the role of the ego.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.660
I'm saying that we all
make decisions out of ego

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.900
at various points in our lives.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.720
These are usually big mistakes.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.820
These cause problems for us.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.240
So what I think happens is if
because of your sense of self

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.480
identity you detach from
reality in some way,

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.790
it makes whatever it is
that you're doing harder

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.510
than it needs to be, right?

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.220
If you're an artist and
you sort of detach yourself

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.870
from reality, you're
not going to be

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.780
able to relate to your audience.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.780
If you're a business
person and you're

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.720
not able to see the flaws
in what you're doing

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.110
and are not able to
listen to your customers,

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.485
your products are going to
get worse, so on and so forth.

00:02:15.485 --> 00:02:17.190
So I think realism--

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.380
a sense of the world
that you live in--

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.600
is really critical to most
of the things that we do.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.550
And I think ego gets
in the way of that.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.539
JORDAN THIBODEAU: So how do
we become aware of our ego?

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:28.830
RYAN HOLIDAY: It's interesting.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.720
I think most people are good at
diagnosing ego in other people.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.940
We're really good at
judging other people

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.850
and saying, why is he doing
this or why is she doing that?

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.610
Like, they have no idea what
other people think of them.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.430
But we don't really apply
that sort of sense of rigor

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.600
to ourselves.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.749
So the book is about
thinking about why you're

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:53.040
doing what you're doing, right?

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.720
Victor Franco has this line--

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.430
between stimulus and response,
there's a choice, right?

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.240
Or there's a pause.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.900
And if you can pause
there and you can reflect,

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.970
you can decide whether
you want to respond

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.470
or how you want to respond.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.650
What I'm sort of talking about
is stepping back and evaluating

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.900
what our motivations are
in a given situation, why

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.600
we're doing things, why we are
attracted to certain things.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.683
And just making sure that
we're doing those things

00:03:17.683 --> 00:03:19.950
for the right reasons
rather than because we

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.810
want to impress other people.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.644
Because we think it says
something about us as a person.

00:03:24.644 --> 00:03:27.060
And sort of just getting rid
of some of those more selfish

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.477
motivations from
what we're doing.

00:03:28.477 --> 00:03:29.935
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
In your book, you

00:03:29.935 --> 00:03:32.040
have a quote that says,
"Ego loves the idea

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.170
that something is fair or not."

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.650
You mentioned the
persecution complex.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.290
What is that and how can we
protect ourselves from it?

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.540
RYAN HOLIDAY: Well, so one
of the themes in my writing

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.723
is stoic philosophy, which
is an ancient philosophy.

00:03:45.723 --> 00:03:48.212
It was popular with
the Greeks and Romans.

00:03:48.212 --> 00:03:49.920
And one of the most
famous practitioners,

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.260
Marcus Aurelius, who's
the old guy in "Gladiator"

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.120
that Joaquin Phoenix's
character kills.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.250
Philosophy is a loaded
word for a lot of people.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.650
Tim Ferriss-- he calls
it an operating system--

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.691
I think that's a better
way of thinking about it.

00:04:07.691 --> 00:04:10.210
It's really a set of
exercises and sort

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.150
of tweaks to your
perspective that

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.700
allows you to function better.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.769
And one of the things
that the stoics talk about

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.250
is the story we tell ourselves
about the things that happen,

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.030
right?

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.900
So if I called you
an asshole right now,

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.750
you would have to think
about whether I was joking

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.180
or whether I was
being serious, right?

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.086
And if you thought I was joking,
it wouldn't hurt your feelings

00:04:37.086 --> 00:04:38.710
and if you thought
I was being serious,

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.300
you would interpret
it as an attack.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.420
And so that interpretation--

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.950
how we determine what
an event is or means--

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.450
that's something
we control, right?

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:54.102
And so they're saying
events are objective.

00:04:54.102 --> 00:04:56.060
Marcus Aurelius says,
there is no good or bad--

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.070
there's only perception.

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.736
There's only what we
think about things.

00:04:58.736 --> 00:05:01.150
So to answer your question,
I think what happens is--

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.040
and this is kind
of related to ego--

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.456
I think it's more of just a
general problem that we have--

00:05:05.456 --> 00:05:09.000
we look at a situation
that we're in

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.580
or we look at a situation then
another person is in-- maybe

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.871
it's someone we're competing
with or we're jealous of--

00:05:13.871 --> 00:05:15.000
and we go, is that fair?

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.670
Should they have that
while I only have this?

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.770
Is it fair that I got fired?

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.880
Is it fair that this went
wrong or that went wrong?

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.430
And the reality is there
is no fair or unfair.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.050
There just is.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.890
And spending a lot of
time labeling things,

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.190
in my experience, often
prevents us from--

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.470
one, prevents us
from solving things

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.531
but it adds an
extra burden on top

00:05:40.531 --> 00:05:43.030
of just dealing with whatever
this thing is in front of you.

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.600
So I think once you
see the stoics do

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:52.440
a lot is sort of strip the
interpretation out of things

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.670
and look at what they are.

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.610
I think what ego often does is
it does the opposite of that.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.180
It adds a bit of our own
identity to a given situation.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:06.600
It looks at how this makes us
look in front of other people.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.724
It's concerned more with
appearances than reality.

00:06:09.724 --> 00:06:11.890
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Another
quote that stuck out to me

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:14.190
is you said, "We
tend to overwork

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.380
as a means of self
escape, as a way of trying

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.000
to justify our existence."

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.490
And this is a quote
from Josef Pieper.

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.490
How does that also
tie into our ego?

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:23.050
RYAN HOLIDAY: There's
some article--

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:23.966
I forgot where it was.

00:06:23.966 --> 00:06:25.500
I read it this
morning on the plane.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.050
And they were talking about--

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:32.130
the stereotype of millennials
is that we're lazy.

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.270
But actually, a significant
portion of millennials

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:35.640
are workaholics.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.567
The term they're starting
to use now is work martyrs.

00:06:39.567 --> 00:06:41.150
And basically, it
means like you think

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.550
you're so important to whatever
it is that you're doing

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.580
or whatever your job is that,
literally, the world would

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.720
end if you didn't do it.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.340
And I've felt that
myself many times.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.220
And this is, of
course, absurd, right?

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.810
Someone sent me
an email yesterday

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.184
and they had a
line in it I like.

00:06:59.184 --> 00:07:01.650
They were saying, if you
were really indispensable,

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:04.170
then you can never be promoted.

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:06.900
So it's not great
to be indispensable.

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:07.650
You're not Atlas.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.705
The world is not sitting
on your shoulders.

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:14.192
I think what happens is that--

00:07:14.192 --> 00:07:15.900
maybe you didn't have
a ton of confidence

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:19.140
as a kid or you didn't feel like
your parents appreciated you--

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:23.790
you can start to mistake
accomplishments in work

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:29.130
or throwing yourself in
work as a sort of a way

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:30.220
to buttress your identity.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.550
It can make you
feel good instead

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:35.460
of just intrinsically feeling
good as a human being, which

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.250
is what your right is to do.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:39.670
I sense this in my
own life, right?

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:44.050
Relationships are complicated,
but work is easy, right?

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.990
I can be fighting
with my wife and I

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.820
can get up and leave the room
and sit down on my computer

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:51.699
and it's not fighting
with me, right?

00:07:51.699 --> 00:07:52.990
There's no complications there.

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:55.060
It's just simple
and straightforward.

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.100
And so I think
oftentimes, instead

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.350
of dealing with difficult
things that we face in life

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:03.500
or dealing with
ambiguity or uncertainty,

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:08.190
we want to immerse ourselves
in work or tasks or activities.

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:12.040
And it's a way of feeling
good about ourselves.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.400
But it's ultimately sort of
running from our problem.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.900
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
Why do people feel

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.840
they have graduated in
certain fields of expertise,

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.760
causing them not
to learn anymore?

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.871
And how do we remain
always a student?

00:08:23.871 --> 00:08:25.870
RYAN HOLIDAY: The book
is split into three parts

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.450
and the first
section of the book

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:31.820
has a section called,
Become a Student.

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:34.400
So it's sort of taking up the
beginner's mindset, right?

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.650
There's a quote from Epictetus,
the stoic philosopher.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:39.340
He says, "One cannot learn that
which they think they already

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:39.970
know."

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:40.299
Right?

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:41.380
And I think this is true.

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:42.610
If you go--
especially when you're

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:44.410
young-- if you think
you know everything

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:46.420
because you went to this
college or that college

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.740
or you started this
company or that company,

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.490
you're not going to
learn anything, right?

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:52.685
You can't learn what you
believe you already know.

00:08:52.685 --> 00:08:55.060
And you can't learn if you
think that you're the smartest

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:55.960
person in the room.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.209
So I think that's one problem.

00:08:57.209 --> 00:09:01.450
That's how ego manifests
itself early on in our careers.

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:04.371
But then what happens is we
start to become successful.

00:09:04.371 --> 00:09:06.370
We accomplish something--
and you see this a lot

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:11.710
with CEOs and politicians--
you get to a point

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:15.460
where you are the
best at what you do.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:19.030
And learning can stop
there too, right?

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:24.460
You're no longer challenged in
the way that you were before.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.560
You might know more
than other people.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.100
And so that atrophies.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.470
And there is going
to be someone else--

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.570
maybe it's 5 years in
the future or 10 years

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:34.930
in the future-- someone else
isn't atrophying in the way

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:35.410
that you are.

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:37.159
And they're eventually
going to catch you.

00:09:37.159 --> 00:09:42.570
And so I think you have to
maintain that student mindset,

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:43.070
right?

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:44.528
There's a quote
from Emerson I have

00:09:44.528 --> 00:09:47.480
in the book who says, "Every
man I meet is in some way

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.791
my superior and in
that I learn of him."

00:09:49.791 --> 00:09:51.290
Basically, he's
saying that you have

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:55.070
to go around and look for the
things that you're not good at.

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:56.270
And you have to improve.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:58.310
Socrates was considered
wise because he

00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:59.900
knew what he didn't know.

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.910
So it's that idea.

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:06.510
John Wheeler, the
physicist-- he's saying,

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.070
"As our island of
knowledge grows,

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:10.070
so too does the shore
of our ignorance."

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:13.220
And I think what you
realize is that if you

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:15.770
think you know everything,
you've stopped learning.

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:16.580
That's one.

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.970
But the second part is actually,
the more that you learn,

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:22.785
the more you are exposed to
things you haven't learned.

00:10:22.785 --> 00:10:23.660
You have that hunger.

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:28.430
If you have that drive to
constantly be exploring that--

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:31.400
exploring the fringes of
what you're butting up into--

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.940
that's a recipe for not
just continual improvement,

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:37.161
but also, it suppresses
the ego, right?

00:10:37.161 --> 00:10:38.660
It prevents you
from thinking you're

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:41.210
better than other people,
because instead of thinking

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:42.626
about all the
things that you know

00:10:42.626 --> 00:10:44.397
versus what they
don't know, you're

00:10:44.397 --> 00:10:45.980
thinking about all
the things that you

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.770
don't know compared
to some other person

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:52.620
that you're modeling
yourself against.

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:53.870
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Interesting.

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:55.430
One story that
stuck out to me was

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:58.340
your story about Jackie Robinson
and what he went through.

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:00.140
Could you elaborate on that?

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:01.070
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah.

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:05.965
Obviously, I've not
experienced anything remotely--

00:11:05.965 --> 00:11:08.340
and most of us in this room
have not experienced anything

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:10.530
remotely like the discrimination
that someone like Jackie

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:11.946
Robinson would
have gone through--

00:11:11.946 --> 00:11:16.914
but it's interesting when you
look at his life, especially

00:11:16.914 --> 00:11:17.580
his early years.

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:19.920
No one would have
predicted that he

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:24.431
would have been the guy
that integrated Major League

00:11:24.431 --> 00:11:24.930
Baseball.

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:28.230
Not because Jackie Robinson
didn't feel strongly

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:32.850
about equality and civil rights
and wasn't a talented athlete.

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:35.370
It was that he felt too strongly
about these things, right?

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:36.750
He got into fights all the time.

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:37.440
He got arrested.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.630
In multiple instances,
police officers

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:44.769
pulled guns on Jackie Robinson
because he was resisting arrest

00:11:44.769 --> 00:11:45.560
or he was fighting.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.130
He would get into trouble.

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:50.610
And I think any of
us reasonably would

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:54.390
react that way to sort
of blatant discrimination

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:56.490
and racism.

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:58.410
And he was in the Army.

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:00.150
He got kicked out of
the Army, basically,

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:04.069
because he refused to go
to the back of a bus, which

00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:06.360
he shouldn't have had to do,
but someone was insisting.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.526
And then the way he handled
that was so over the top

00:12:08.526 --> 00:12:10.080
that he ended up
getting a discharge.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.360
So anyway, he is not who
you would have predicted,

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:17.850
because when Branch Rickey, who
was the manager of the Dodgers,

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:19.800
was looking for someone--

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.221
he wanted for a long time
to integrate Major League

00:12:22.221 --> 00:12:22.720
Baseball.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.420
He wanted to hire
a black player.

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:26.500
And he had a few
different players in mind.

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:29.120
And he has this famous
meeting with Jackie Robinson.

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.971
And he's asking him, what
would you do in this situation?

00:12:31.971 --> 00:12:33.470
What would you do
in that situation?

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:34.930
A waiter does this.

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:38.910
You get refused
access to a hotel.

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:40.190
Someone throws a pitch at you.

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:40.912
What do you do?

00:12:40.912 --> 00:12:42.370
And he was testing
Jackie Robinson.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:45.240
He said, I'm looking for a
player who has the guts not

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:48.540
to fight back, because he
knew that racist players would

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:52.560
be attempting to goad him
into responding in such a way

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.540
that they could then use that
to kick him out of baseball.

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:59.730
So to me, what was so impressive
about Jackie Robinson is

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:03.180
that his entire time in Major
League Baseball, he never

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.520
he never got in a fight
with another player,

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.890
even though people said
horrible things to him.

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:09.895
They actually would
slide spike first--

00:13:09.895 --> 00:13:11.520
which is something
you are not supposed

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:14.366
to do in baseball-- at him
to try to take out his legs.

00:13:14.366 --> 00:13:15.240
They would taunt him.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:18.425
He was hit with dozens and
dozens of pitches on purpose.

00:13:18.425 --> 00:13:20.340
But he never fought back.

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.770
He sort of channeled all
that energy and that rage

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:25.324
into playing.

00:13:25.324 --> 00:13:26.740
And that's what
made him so great.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.830
And it's ultimately what
allowed other players

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:31.620
to follow in his footsteps--
that entire experiment could

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:34.170
have been set back if he
had responded differently.

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:38.550
And so to me, the analogy is
I think we all face examples

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:40.440
like that in our lives.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.680
Again, not as severe, but
you're the youngest person

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.620
hired by a certain company.

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:49.890
Your wife or your husband--

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:51.360
their family doesn't approve.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.457
You are going to be goaded.

00:13:53.457 --> 00:13:55.040
People are going to
say things to you.

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.456
You're going to
be underestimated.

00:13:56.456 --> 00:13:58.760
How are you going to
choose to respond to that?

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.410
If you are ruled
by your emotions,

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:02.160
if you're ruled by
your passion, if you're

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:06.000
ruled by this sense of
justice in the short term

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.490
and you insist on getting
your satisfaction in respect

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:10.230
to every one of
those situations,

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:11.370
you're not going to
make it very far.

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:13.036
You have to be able
to bite your tongue.

00:14:13.036 --> 00:14:15.000
You have to be able
to think long term.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.510
You have to have some sort of
sense of mission and purpose

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:22.110
that allows you to transcend
the petty concerns in a given

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:23.040
situation.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.110
You get shit on a lot when
you try to do big things.

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:28.710
And you have to be comfortable
with that and OK with that,

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:34.390
and you have to be able
to persevere through it.

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:35.230
So that's the story.

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:36.340
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Yeah.

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:37.700
That was a great story.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:41.850
And one of my mentors--
his name was Frank--

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:45.210
and he went on to become one
of the first African-American

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:47.770
directors of a
prominent tech company.

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:49.800
And he had a history--

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:53.130
he actually marched with
Dr. Martin Luther King

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:54.700
during the Civil
Rights movement.

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:57.120
And he got brought in through
the tech company's diversity

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.070
program.

00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:00.750
And there was another
African-American before him

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:02.710
who was just as
qualified, educated.

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:06.780
But he went through brutal
racism through the company.

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:10.500
And because the way he responded
to it, he was pigeonholed.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.170
And that person became a
mentor to Frank and basically

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:15.870
gave him the same advice
that Jackie received,

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:18.090
which allowed scores of
other African-Americans

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:21.770
to follow him and actually
earn other positions

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:23.910
in corporate America or
nonprofit work, which

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:27.840
weren't accessible
to minorities before.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.970
So what are the
positive aspects of ego?

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:33.567
I mean, we talk about
arrogance, but could there

00:15:33.567 --> 00:15:35.400
be a positive aspect
when people, let's say,

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.769
lack self-confidence
in a situation?

00:15:37.769 --> 00:15:39.310
RYAN HOLIDAY: Well,
one of the things

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:40.935
I've spent a lot of
time thinking about

00:15:40.935 --> 00:15:43.386
is that exact question, right?

00:15:43.386 --> 00:15:44.760
You don't write
a book saying ego

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:47.280
is bad without maybe spending
a couple of seconds thinking

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.800
about, they have
some positive traits.

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:53.940
The way that I define it as
sort of delusion and arrogance

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:58.230
and superiority and this
sort of group of traits--

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:00.540
I would say, no, I
don't think there's

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:02.700
any reason that you
want to introduce

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:03.870
those things into your life.

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:05.700
Now, is confidence important?

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:06.540
Absolutely.

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:09.240
But I want to make the
distinction between confidence

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:11.640
and ego.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:15.510
I talk about this
a lot in the book.

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:18.210
The distinction is that
confidence is earned.

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:23.430
Confidence is based on fact,
on experience, on information.

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:26.490
And ego is based on--

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:28.800
if confidence is
what is real, ego

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.160
is what we wish
to be true, right?

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:39.230
Aristotle has this concept
of the golden mean, right?

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:43.040
And so he's saying that
every virtue is basically

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:46.290
the midway point between
two vices, two extremes.

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:55.720
So he's saying courage is
halfway between recklessness

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.160
and cowardice.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.740
It's right there in the middle.

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:03.620
Or generosity is
halfway between--

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:08.740
again, sort of giving your
money away and being tight

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:10.210
fisted, right?

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:12.250
And so I think I
would put confidence

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:14.349
in the middle between ego--

00:17:14.349 --> 00:17:17.350
sort of self-absorbed
superiority--

00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:18.849
and then on the
other, ironically, I

00:17:18.849 --> 00:17:21.230
think a lot of people who
are crippled by self-doubt

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:22.930
just spend too much time
thinking about themselves.

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:24.263
They think they know everything.

00:17:24.263 --> 00:17:26.770
They think they know why
you're screwing them over,

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:29.480
and why this will never work,
and all of these things.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:33.830
So I consider confidence
and humility in some ways

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:36.210
to be synonyms, right?

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:39.050
Humility, it literally
means lowliness.

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:41.780
But the definition
we have of humility

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:44.480
is someone who sort of knows
their strengths and weaknesses.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.772
They accurately see themselves.

00:17:45.772 --> 00:17:47.813
They don't think they're
better than anyone else.

00:17:47.813 --> 00:17:49.430
They're sort of
inwardly focused.

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:50.810
To me, confidence is similar.

00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:53.510
Confidence is knowing what
you're capable of, right?

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:56.990
It's saying, hey, I know
I can do this because I've

00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:58.910
done similar things before.

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:00.620
Or I know that I'm
a quick learner,

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:02.090
I know that I'm
not going to quit.

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:03.620
Those are things
to be confident in.

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:06.470
Just going in and thinking,
hey, this is going to be easy,

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:08.890
I'm the greatest there ever was.

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:11.810
Or not even bothering to
stop and think about what

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:14.690
would happen if it turned out
to be harder than you expected

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:15.350
or whatever.

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:17.540
That's where ego is
problematic, right?

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:18.680
JORDAN THIBODEAU: And I
think a lot of startups

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.900
in Silicon Valley-- and
you're going against the odds

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:21.840
as a startup company.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.799
So you have to puff yourself up.

00:18:23.799 --> 00:18:25.340
RYAN HOLIDAY: Well,
you think you do.

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:26.290
You think that you do.

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:28.921
But this is typically a bad
starting point in my opinion,

00:18:28.921 --> 00:18:29.420
right?

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:34.820
So obviously, yes-- you
are going into something

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:37.310
where the odds are
overwhelmingly against you.

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:42.440
But lying to yourself
does not change those odds

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.490
in any fundamental way.

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:46.500
I think what's actually
courageous and brave is to say,

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.380
hey, I'm doing this thing.

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:49.610
I know that it's risky.

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:50.990
I know that it's hard.

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:53.650
But I'm confident
in my own abilities

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:55.669
that if it is
possible, I can do it.

00:18:55.669 --> 00:18:56.960
Marcus Aurelius says this line.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.447
He's saying, if it's humanly
possible and you're human,

00:18:59.447 --> 00:19:00.530
then you can do it, right?

00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:04.850
And so that to me
is not delusional.

00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:06.890
But going in and
thinking, of course,

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:08.430
I'm starting the next Facebook.

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:11.217
And in two years, I'm
going to sell it--

00:19:11.217 --> 00:19:13.550
having this sort sense of
certainty about something that

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:18.590
you cannot be certain about
that is predicated on numerous

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:21.440
contingencies that are
outside your control--

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.050
I don't see how
that's productive.

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:24.210
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
And in thinking

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:26.501
you're the next Facebook,
you're missing a lot of steps

00:19:26.501 --> 00:19:27.669
in the process, right?

00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:28.460
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah.

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.310
I mean, look, you sit
down to write a book.

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:34.490
If you tell yourself
you are writing

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:38.169
the great American novel,
that might help you

00:19:38.169 --> 00:19:39.710
with your nerves a
little bit, but it

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:43.490
doesn't help you write the next
great American novel, you know?

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:46.160
Kanye West is not a great rapper
because he has a huge ego.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.740
He's a great rapper because
he's a great rapper, right?

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:50.115
Because he put in the work.

00:19:50.115 --> 00:19:53.630
He learned how to do this and
he spent hundreds and hundreds

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:54.830
of hours doing it.

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:58.670
So to me, it's all extraneous.

00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:01.190
That's not why people
are good at what they do.

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:05.930
Sure, in the way
that, let's say,

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:10.700
a drug might mask an inner
pain for a short amount of time

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:14.520
before it escalates
into an addiction,

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:17.120
I think you can see a similar
thing with ego, right?

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:20.390
If you're starting a
company, writing a book,

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:23.320
moving across the country
to become an actor--

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:24.890
these are scary things.

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:27.650
And you can numb
yourself of that pain

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:29.870
through ego and
narcissism, I guess,

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:31.760
but that's all it's doing.

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.300
It's not making
the pain go away.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:34.940
It's just numbing it slightly.

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:38.350
And often, I find that it
pops up in other places.

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:40.070
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Right.

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:44.032
What are three things we
can do to check our ego?

00:20:44.032 --> 00:20:45.740
RYAN HOLIDAY: Well,
I think just thinking

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:47.820
about it is the thing that
most people don't do, right?

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:49.486
They're not asking,
why am I doing this?

00:20:49.486 --> 00:20:50.810
Why is this so important to me?

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:53.725
Why do I feel like
I need to be right?

00:20:53.725 --> 00:20:55.100
They're not asking
that question,

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:57.770
and I urge people to do that.

00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:00.860
I think the thing we were
talking about earlier

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:04.420
about always focusing
on what you don't know,

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:06.420
focusing on what there's
left to learn-- to me,

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:09.390
what I love about writing
is that it's an inherently

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:14.010
humbling thing to do, right?

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:17.340
Every day, I wake up and it's
not as good as I want it to be,

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:19.620
and it never will be as
good as it is in my head.

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:22.800
So that suppresses
the ego attack.

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:26.130
Attaching yourself to some
larger pursuit of mastery,

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:28.320
I think, knocks down
the ego a little bit.

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:33.130
And the big thing for me
is sort of disconnecting

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:35.760
and experiencing something
greater than yourself.

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.290
I think that's
another part of it.

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:41.580
So it's hard to feel like you're
that important when you're

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:42.829
in the Redwood forest, right?

00:21:42.829 --> 00:21:44.370
When you're surrounded
by things that

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:46.400
are older than you
will ever live to be,

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.210
that are taller than
you will ever be,

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:50.160
that could crush
you in an instant.

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.740
I think going out and
experiencing nature,

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:56.100
experiencing timeless things is
another way to sort of combat

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:57.630
the ego as well.

00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:00.724
I think oftentimes, if you were
living and breathing your work

00:22:00.724 --> 00:22:02.640
and that's all you're
thinking about, it does.

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:05.550
It becomes the most important
thing in the world to you.

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:07.740
And that skewing
of your priority

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:09.892
can hold you back as well.

00:22:09.892 --> 00:22:11.850
JORDAN THIBODEAU: I think
something we commonly

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:16.290
deal with here at Google or
any other places where there's

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:19.140
competition and you're around a
lot of people who are bright--

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:20.865
I consider myself the
Forrest Gump here--

00:22:20.865 --> 00:22:21.990
there's an exception made--

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:25.470
but have you ever dealt
with imposter syndrome?

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:26.762
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah.

00:22:26.762 --> 00:22:28.750
Do you guys know what
imposter syndrome is?

00:22:32.589 --> 00:22:33.130
I don't know.

00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:36.640
I mean, I think
anyone who's going out

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:40.750
and sort of chasing that
brass ring-- when you get it,

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:42.760
you get it for a little bit.

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:44.260
You instantly feel that flip.

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.040
Do I deserve this?

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.470
What does this feel like?

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:51.110
Are they going to find me out?

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:53.950
I think you deal with that.

00:22:53.950 --> 00:23:02.630
I think to a certain degree, the
less you think about yourself,

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:04.160
the less that comes up, right?

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.380
So the more you are
focused on the job

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:09.950
rather than how does everyone
think I'm doing about it--

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:12.770
what is everyone's opinion
of me is one concern.

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:15.770
And the other is, am I
doing the best possible job

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:18.020
that I can do?

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:21.170
I think the less you are focused
on what others are thinking

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:22.670
and what you are
thinking and you're

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:25.340
focused more in the present
moment of whatever you're

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:25.910
doing--

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:30.140
to me, that's a way to combat
that thing a little bit.

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:33.020
Especially with some of
the social media tools,

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:34.790
we kind of get the
sense that people

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:37.040
are paying attention to us
a lot more than they really

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:37.970
fucking are.

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:40.080
Like, nobody cares.

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.040
Nobody cares.

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:46.710
And nobody is watching,
you know what I mean?

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:49.490
JORDAN THIBODEAU: It would be a
good title for your next book.

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:51.990
RYAN HOLIDAY: The original title
I wanted to do for the book

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:54.800
when it was sort of about
a different topic was,

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:58.090
"Your Life is Not a Novel
and This is Not a Movie."

00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:01.610
We think that we're in this
movie and that we're the star

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:02.990
and everyone's--

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:04.730
but everyone thinks that, right?

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:06.140
And so that doesn't work.

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:08.070
That's inherently in
conflict with each other.

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:10.444
So you can stop thinking that
there's this audience who's

00:24:10.444 --> 00:24:13.670
like, observing your every
move and dissecting this--

00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:15.620
like you're Kim
Kardashian or something--

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:17.810
the easier it is for you
to just focus on whatever

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:19.020
it is that you're doing.

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:22.110
So this imposter syndrome--

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:25.810
inherent within the logic
is somebody is trying,

00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:29.360
is searching and trying to
find out who should be here

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:30.770
and who shouldn't be here.

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:33.650
And the reality is
no one is doing that.

00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:36.651
JORDAN THIBODEAU: I think
Naval Ravikant for AngelList

00:24:36.651 --> 00:24:38.900
says that everyone thinks
they are in their own movie.

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:39.500
RYAN HOLIDAY: Totally.

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:40.325
JORDAN THIBODEAU: And
he looks at situations

00:24:40.325 --> 00:24:41.990
as if he has a challenge--

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:44.952
OK, maybe this person
is the part of the plot,

00:24:44.952 --> 00:24:46.910
or this person can be
the villain or something.

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:49.310
Or maybe I'm the sidekick
in someone else's movie,

00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:51.684
to take the centeredness out
of the whole entire story.

00:24:51.684 --> 00:24:53.600
RYAN HOLIDAY: Well, I
think that attitude just

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:57.740
makes everything seem a lot more
important than it is, right?

00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:03.890
You get this sense that if your
life has to correspond or feel

00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:08.830
like a movie, you
have to exaggerate

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:11.094
the importance of everything.

00:25:11.094 --> 00:25:12.760
The reality is if
your life was a movie,

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:15.880
it'd be a really boring one
and it'd be really long.

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:19.351
So maybe that's not
a great metaphor.

00:25:19.351 --> 00:25:20.350
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Right.

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:21.070
That's true.

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:25.129
Yeah so another quote that stuck
out was from James Bashford.

00:25:25.129 --> 00:25:26.920
He said, "It requires
a strong constitution

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:30.160
to withstand repeated
attacks of prosperity."

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:32.260
So how do companies
prevent themselves

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:34.960
from creating ego of
success and entitlement?

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:36.560
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah.

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:39.440
Well, I think we tend to be
on guard for the worst case

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:42.380
scenarios, and we don't
think that much about

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:44.810
how the good scenarios--

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:49.040
what changes they will bring
or how they will change us.

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:51.110
I think that's what he's
saying in that quote.

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:55.030
One of the famous lines
about Marcus Aurelius

00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:58.790
is from Matthew Arnold, who was
a Christian scholar and writer.

00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:02.780
And he was saying, he's
one of the few people who

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:07.550
was given absolute power
and he became better for it.

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:08.450
That's unheard of.

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:09.860
I mean, we even have that line--

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:12.350
absolute power
corrupts absolutely.

00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:15.664
And I think you tend to see--

00:26:15.664 --> 00:26:17.955
and I have experienced this
and I think a lot of people

00:26:17.955 --> 00:26:19.913
have-- you experience
some semblance of success

00:26:19.913 --> 00:26:24.230
and all of a sudden, you
have these new temptations

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:27.260
and these new responsibilities
and new stresses.

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:29.890
And they kind of make
you an asshole, right?

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:32.380
Because you have all
this stuff and you're

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:34.430
not prepared for
it and all of that.

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:39.190
And so I think a
company has to, I think,

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:42.610
internally make sure that they
are not supporting and enabling

00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:45.680
those people who thrive
on dominating others

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:48.100
or think that it's
all about them.

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:51.040
But also, the company
has to make sure

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:54.890
that it's not buying
into its own hype, right?

00:26:54.890 --> 00:27:02.080
That it realizes that they do
that analysis where it's like,

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:06.490
50% of the Fortune 500
companies from 1950

00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:08.690
are not in the
Fortune 500 anymore.

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:10.790
Some even higher
number than that.

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:12.970
Your reign is very
short, even when

00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:14.690
you're the best at what you do.

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:19.900
And so if companies can
embrace that and sort of

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:24.790
be open to the fact that
there's tons of change

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:26.380
and that industries
shift, then it

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:28.360
doesn't matter how
dominant you are

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:32.690
right now if you don't
think about those changes

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:33.530
and those shifts.

00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:35.304
If you embrace that
disruption, it's

00:27:35.304 --> 00:27:36.970
going to happen to
you anyway and you're

00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:38.140
on the wrong end of it.

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:40.030
So I think it's also
important that companies

00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:42.040
don't get that inner
ego that we're the best,

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:43.140
we're unbeatable.

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:44.830
And that's what happens
to sports teams.

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:48.220
It's why it's so hard to win two
Super Bowls in a row or two NBA

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:49.660
championships in a row.

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:51.160
Because the team
tears itself apart.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:52.515
The egos ruin it.

00:27:52.515 --> 00:27:54.640
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Gave me
a flashback of my Lakers.

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:55.450
Kobe and Shaq.

00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:56.350
RYAN HOLIDAY: Sure.

00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:58.141
JORDAN THIBODEAU: A
couple of championships

00:27:58.141 --> 00:28:01.760
left on the table because
of politics inside.

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.640
In your chapter on Always Love,
you include the following quote

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:07.100
from Martin Luther
King, "Hate at any point

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:09.920
is a cancer that gnaws away
at the very vital center

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:12.035
of your life and
your existence-- it

00:28:12.035 --> 00:28:13.790
is like an eroding
acid that eats away

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:16.280
the best and the objective
center of your life."

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:18.825
Can you talk more
about this quote?

00:28:18.825 --> 00:28:20.450
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah,
I think anyone here

00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:25.280
who's ever been screwed
over or hurt by someone--

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:29.420
I would ask yourself what the
emotions you felt afterwards--

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:33.220
were those a positive force in
your life or a negative force,

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:33.800
right?

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:39.230
So does the bitterness
or resentment or anger

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:40.970
that you felt for that person--

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:43.790
did it one, do anything
about the situation?

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:46.820
And two, did it alleviate the
pain that you felt at all?

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:53.860
And three, did it
improve your life, right?

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:56.350
And usually, the answer is no.

00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:58.000
There's a quote
from Seneca saying,

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.810
you would never think to return
a bite to a dog or a kick

00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:03.222
to a mule.

00:29:03.222 --> 00:29:04.430
But that's what we do, right?

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:08.080
Someone hurts us, so then
we want to hurt them back.

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:11.590
Or someone says something
judgmental about us

00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:15.430
so we want to judge them.

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:18.370
I think a better reaction
is obviously, compassion.

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:21.670
It's to try to think about where
this person is coming from.

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:22.672
There's a good line--

00:29:22.672 --> 00:29:24.130
I think it's from
Socrates-- saying

00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:26.106
no one does wrong on purpose.

00:29:26.106 --> 00:29:27.730
Obviously, there's
sociopaths out there

00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:29.230
in the world and
horrible people.

00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:31.600
But generally, think
about all the times

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:32.840
that you hurt other people.

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.840
When you did it, were you
consciously attempting

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:37.480
to hurt them, or was it
that you didn't know,

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.520
or you weren't thinking,
or you were caught up

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:41.170
in the moment or
whatever, right?

00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:45.261
And so it's like, we cut
ourselves breaks all the time,

00:29:45.261 --> 00:29:45.760
right?

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.630
That's how we live
with ourselves.

00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:50.830
But we cut other
people very few breaks.

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:52.960
And not only do we
not cut them breaks,

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:57.010
we hold on to whatever they
did to us and it eats at us

00:29:57.010 --> 00:29:59.260
and we carry it around with us.

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:03.670
And so that chapter there
is that oftentimes, the way

00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:05.530
ego manifests itself
when we're doing great

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:07.360
is one problematic form.

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:10.510
But the way it
manifests itself when

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:13.240
we're going through something
tough, when we lose,

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:16.450
when we end up on the
wrong end of something--

00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:19.000
we often extend
that painful period

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.350
because we hate instead
of letting it go.

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:26.800
Or better, just
appreciating what

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:28.920
happened and the
people involved.

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:29.920
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Right.

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:32.230
RYAN HOLIDAY: Easier said
than done though, of course.

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:33.480
JORDAN THIBODEAU: That's true.

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.200
It's like drinking the poison
and expecting someone else

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:35.849
to die.

00:30:35.849 --> 00:30:36.640
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah.

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:37.764
Yeah, that's exactly right.

00:30:37.764 --> 00:30:38.759
That's a great line.

00:30:38.759 --> 00:30:40.300
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
So you were talking

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:42.540
in your book about
outcome independence

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:44.050
and not focusing on results.

00:30:44.050 --> 00:30:46.600
Can you share the
story about the writer

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:49.359
who wrote the
"Confederacy of Dunces"?

00:30:49.359 --> 00:30:50.150
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah.

00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:52.600
Has anyone here read "A
Confederacy of Dunces"?

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:54.740
It's an amazing book, right?

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:56.320
It's maybe the funniest book--

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:59.420
I would say the funniest
novel ever written.

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:02.230
It's just so funny that they
can't turn it into a movie.

00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:03.790
Like, they've tried.

00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:05.980
John Belushi, Will Ferrell--

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:07.700
it's been like this
perennial book.

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:09.533
They've never been able
to turn into a movie

00:31:09.533 --> 00:31:10.919
because it's so funny.

00:31:10.919 --> 00:31:11.960
Buy anyway, it's amazing.

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:14.293
This guy-- he wrote it-- his
name is John Kennedy Toole.

00:31:14.293 --> 00:31:15.530
He wrote this novel.

00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:19.212
He submits it to Simon and
Schuster, and they say,

00:31:19.212 --> 00:31:20.545
no one is going to publish this.

00:31:20.545 --> 00:31:21.760
This book is not good.

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:22.790
I'm sorry.

00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:24.790
And here he argues with
them and they say, look,

00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:25.480
it's not going to work.

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:27.580
He talks to a few other
people and basically, he

00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:30.790
resigns himself to the fact
that it will never be published

00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:34.990
and puts it in a
drawer in his desk.

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:38.230
A few months later,
he commits suicide

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:41.350
alone in a back
road in Mississippi.

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:45.210
He attaches a garden hose to
the exhaust pipe of his car.

00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:46.360
And he dies.

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:50.601
And it's a tragic literary loss,
although people don't know this

00:31:50.601 --> 00:31:51.100
at the time.

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:55.660
His mother finds the manuscript
a few years later in the desk

00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:57.429
drawer he left it in.

00:31:57.429 --> 00:31:59.470
She takes it, she reads
it, she thinks it's good.

00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:01.060
She takes it to a
literary professor

00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:03.730
in New Orleans
who happened to be

00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:06.490
a writer named Walker Percy,
who's also an amazing writer.

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:08.950
He reads it, he
immediately recognizes it

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:10.580
as a work of genius.

00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:12.550
He has it published by
the University Press

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:14.400
there in Louisiana.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:17.150
And it wins the Pulitzer Prize
for literature that year.

00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:21.470
So obviously, nothing
changed from the submission

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:24.130
at Simon and Schuster to
winning the Pulitzer Prize.

00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:25.030
I mean, he was dead.

00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:27.850
He didn't improve it
or anything, right?

00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:33.940
And so this is the
problem with letting

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:36.220
other people's
opinion of your work

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:39.250
determine whether it's
valuable or not, right?

00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:42.484
Obviously, ideally, they should
have seen it for what it was.

00:32:42.484 --> 00:32:43.900
But people are
wrong all the time.

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:44.770
They don't know.

00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:46.630
Some things are
ahead of their time.

00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:49.390
Some things are decades
ahead of their time.

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:51.400
Some things are
just presented wrong

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:54.220
or it's the wrong moment
or whatever it is, right?

00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:57.730
So I find it to be really
sad that literature--

00:32:57.730 --> 00:33:00.816
instead of appreciating the fact
that he made this great thing,

00:33:00.816 --> 00:33:02.440
he attached to whether
it was published

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:05.530
or not and how it was
received by an audience.

00:33:05.530 --> 00:33:08.170
About not only whether
the work was worth it,

00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:11.920
but whether he deserved
to be alive or not, right?

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:14.380
Which is obviously an
extreme interpretation.

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:16.300
And as a writer,
I relate to that.

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:19.159
Because you spend all this
time, you work on this book,

00:33:19.159 --> 00:33:20.950
and at a certain point
it leaves your hands

00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:22.510
and there's nothing else
you can do about it.

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:24.010
And this is true
for a lot of work.

00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:28.090
But if, as a
creative person, you

00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:31.720
have decided that the arbiter
of whether it was good

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:34.680
or not or whether your
time was well spent or not

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:37.360
is how it is received
by these other people,

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:39.520
you've now taken your
sense of self worth

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:41.650
and you deferred it out.

00:33:41.650 --> 00:33:43.930
You've placed it in
other people's control.

00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:45.880
And those people are going to
let you down from time to time.

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:47.780
They're not going to
appreciate what you did.

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:48.940
They're going to judge it.

00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:51.590
They're going to be afraid
of it or whatever it is.

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:53.725
And so that's something
you have to practice.

00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:00.130
Warren Buffett has a line--

00:34:00.130 --> 00:34:02.440
it's better to live your
life by an inner scorecard

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:04.030
than an outer scoreboard.

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:07.530
What is it that you measure
your own success by?

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:09.850
And ideally, it should be
things that are entirely

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:11.330
in your control, right?

00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:13.030
Like I know I
wrote a great book.

00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:14.650
I know that was the
best work that I'm

00:34:14.650 --> 00:34:16.239
capable of doing
when I wrote it.

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:19.040
I know how much
time I put into it.

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:21.620
Obviously, I want it to sell.

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:25.400
But it's better
that I go into it

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:28.489
aware of the fact that
it could potentially not

00:34:28.489 --> 00:34:30.770
and that people might hate it.

00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:32.760
And I have to be OK with that.

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:37.049
And if you're not, then it's not
the right profession for you.

00:34:37.049 --> 00:34:38.840
And so that's something
we have to work at.

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:41.381
JORDAN THIBODEAU: It sounds like
if you focus on the results,

00:34:41.381 --> 00:34:43.330
you can set yourself
up becoming a victim.

00:34:43.330 --> 00:34:45.074
Saying people never
see things my way.

00:34:45.074 --> 00:34:46.699
RYAN HOLIDAY: And
the other tricky part

00:34:46.699 --> 00:34:48.710
is that the goalposts move.

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:52.280
So if you tell yourself,
if I'm a millionaire,

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:54.254
I'll feel good and valuable.

00:34:54.254 --> 00:34:55.670
And then you get
a million dollars

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:57.405
and doesn't feel like anything.

00:34:57.405 --> 00:34:59.780
If you think hitting the New
York Times bestseller list--

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:01.220
that'll make me feel good--

00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:04.190
or marrying this
beautiful man or woman,

00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:08.390
or sleeping with this number of
people, or having this house,

00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:11.936
or making it in New York City.

00:35:11.936 --> 00:35:13.310
Robert Louis
Stevenson is saying,

00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:17.030
it's a difficult thing
to scale arduous hilltops

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:19.800
and find humanity indifferent
to your achievements.

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.560
That's fucking life, right?

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:22.730
That's just how it goes.

00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:23.430
Nobody cares.

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:24.680
JORDAN THIBODEAU: That's true.

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:26.140
RYAN HOLIDAY: You have to care.

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:27.890
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
That's really important.

00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:29.970
I remember I told
myself growing up,

00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:32.390
if I can get off of Section
8 housing, I'll be happy.

00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:33.920
Then I got off
Section 8 housing--

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:36.470
OK, if I can start investing
in real estate, I'll be happy.

00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:38.995
I started investing in real
estate and this circle--

00:35:38.995 --> 00:35:41.120
RYAN HOLIDAY: They call
that conditional happiness.

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:44.310
The idea that you will be
happy when this thing happens.

00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:47.410
It never ever ever is true.

00:35:47.410 --> 00:35:48.410
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Right.

00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:51.560
So you talked a
lot about stoicism.

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:53.950
For someone just
getting into stoicism,

00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:56.390
where do you find a
natural starting point?

00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:58.821
Marcus Aurelius seems to
be the most accessible.

00:35:58.821 --> 00:36:00.320
But some people are
wondering if you

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.236
think there's a better
place to start learning

00:36:02.236 --> 00:36:03.251
about stoic philosophy.

00:36:03.251 --> 00:36:05.500
RYAN HOLIDAY: I wrote a piece
for Tim Ferriss' website

00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:07.760
a few years ago
called Stoicism 101,

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:09.326
Philosophy for Entrepreneurs.

00:36:09.326 --> 00:36:10.700
That's a pretty
good entry point.

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:15.140
Marcus Aurelius is
how I got into it.

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:18.500
I think Seneca has
an essay called

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:21.080
"On the Shortness of
Life" that is a really

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:23.390
sort of beautiful moving essay.

00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:25.020
It's short to read.

00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:29.360
It's a problem that we all
deal with, which is that we die

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:32.430
and we don't know how much
time we have on this planet.

00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:33.950
I'd maybe start there.

00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:34.880
I'm working on a book.

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:37.380
I have a book coming out later
in this year called the Daily

00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:40.850
Stoic, which is like one page
of stoic thought every day

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:46.550
like from the original Greek
and Latin translations.

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:51.810
But I would just say pick
up one of the originals.

00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:53.307
They are very, very readable.

00:36:53.307 --> 00:36:55.640
They're not what you think
when you think of philosophy.

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:57.620
But I would say
don't read whatever

00:36:57.620 --> 00:36:59.060
is free on the internet.

00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:00.950
They're free on the
internet because they

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:07.040
are archaic old translations
that use words and phrases.

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:08.780
Translation is an art.

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:12.380
And spend the $9 to
get a translation

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:16.010
from Penguin or something that
is at least somewhat modern.

00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:18.072
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Right.

00:37:18.072 --> 00:37:20.030
In your book, you have
a quote that's from you.

00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:20.902
It says--

00:37:20.902 --> 00:37:22.860
RYAN HOLIDAY: It's not
a quote if it's from me.

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:26.750
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Oh sorry,
a statement from you.

00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:29.510
"This is the book I wish existed
at critical turning points

00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:30.870
my own life.

00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:32.497
When I, like everyone
else, was called

00:37:32.497 --> 00:37:34.580
to answer the most critical
questions a person can

00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:36.020
ask themselves in life--

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:37.820
who I want to be."

00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:39.440
So who do you want to be?

00:37:40.987 --> 00:37:42.820
RYAN HOLIDAY: It's a
very personal question.

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:43.810
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Just
imagine no one's here.

00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:44.629
Just me and you.

00:37:44.629 --> 00:37:45.420
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah.

00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:49.670
Well, what I was
saying is that I

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:54.470
wanted the book to be sort of
a set of things to think about.

00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:56.450
What the smartest
people in history

00:37:56.450 --> 00:37:59.880
have said at various
junctures in your life.

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:03.320
And I don't think you
just are this one thing.

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:06.300
Obviously, I wanted
to be a writer.

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:07.790
But I also want
to be a good one.

00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:09.380
I also want to be
just a good person.

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:10.546
I want to be a good husband.

00:38:10.546 --> 00:38:12.480
I want to be a good father.

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:15.020
I want to be any of
these things, right?

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:18.590
So I don't think there's
one thing that I want to be.

00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:20.090
And I don't think
I necessarily have

00:38:20.090 --> 00:38:22.370
an answer to that question.

00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:24.340
But it's a question I
think you're facing,

00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:30.945
and what you want in those
moments is not to wing it.

00:38:30.945 --> 00:38:32.570
There's this quote
I have from Bismarck

00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:35.750
in the book that says, "Any
fool can learn by experience.

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:37.760
I prefer to learn by the
experience of others,"

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:38.840
is what he's saying.

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:41.030
And that's what I try
to do in my writing is

00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:45.680
take the experiences of
others and organize them

00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:49.550
in a coherent way that allows
people and myself to draw from

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:51.480
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Gotcha.

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:54.037
You have mentors, relationships.

00:38:54.037 --> 00:38:56.120
When you have a conflict,
how do you deal with it?

00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:58.940
And what gets under your skin
and kind of throws you off

00:38:58.940 --> 00:38:59.600
your balance?

00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:01.724
RYAN HOLIDAY: When I have
a conflict with a mentor?

00:39:01.724 --> 00:39:03.860
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Or
just any mentors or--

00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:08.820
RYAN HOLIDAY: I mean,
typically I find--

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:11.320
I'll give you this
one trick I found.

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:13.030
When I worked at
a large company,

00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:16.450
I found that there would
often be conflicts between two

00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:18.190
people-- you're
arguing over an email--

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:22.030
and someone wants to get
the last word, right?

00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:24.430
I would decide when I would
have the last word, right?

00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:26.789
So I'd be like, I said
what I'm going to say.

00:39:26.789 --> 00:39:28.330
There's nothing that
you can say here

00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:29.746
that's going to
change my opinion.

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:36.560
Basically, I remember I was
in this argument with someone

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:38.980
and I said what I had to say.

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:41.286
I've said my piece
and then I was

00:39:41.286 --> 00:39:42.910
going to do whatever
I was going to do.

00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:46.300
And they responded but
my phone ate their email

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:47.800
and I didn't see it.

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.960
And then like two months later--

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:51.777
so I forgot all
about it, I moved on.

00:39:51.777 --> 00:39:53.860
And then I found their
response a few months later

00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:56.150
and I read it and it
made me really angry.

00:39:56.150 --> 00:40:01.210
And so I was like, if I just
never found this email--

00:40:01.210 --> 00:40:03.480
and we interacted with
each other inbetween

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:04.800
and things had gotten better.

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:06.060
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Sort
of drumming up the old.

00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:06.880
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah.

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:10.760
And so I was like, I
can just do this myself.

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:11.920
When I'm done I'm done.

00:40:14.590 --> 00:40:16.660
Lincoln did this.

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:19.900
Abraham Lincoln-- he would get
in a fight with a subordinate

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:22.844
or a general or someone and he'd
write them a really long letter

00:40:22.844 --> 00:40:24.760
describing all the things
that they did wrong,

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:27.126
that he was mad about, and
laying out his opinion.

00:40:27.126 --> 00:40:28.750
And then he would
put it in an envelope

00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:30.160
and he'd leave it in his desk.

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.993
And we only know that
a lot of these letters

00:40:31.993 --> 00:40:33.430
existed because we found them.

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:36.400
But he would never mail them.

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:41.120
And I would say the vast
majority of conflicts--

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:42.580
it's not that you're
avoiding them.

00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:46.750
But it's that if
you cease to prolong

00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:49.540
and escalate them, they
eventually resolve themselves

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:50.530
and go away.

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:52.750
JORDAN THIBODEAU: True.

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:55.459
So going into our
society, what do you think

00:40:55.459 --> 00:40:57.250
are the general character
traits and trends

00:40:57.250 --> 00:40:58.600
of our current culture?

00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:01.390
And what you think are the most
potentially dangerous things

00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:03.689
about these treats that
should be addressed?

00:41:03.689 --> 00:41:05.230
RYAN HOLIDAY: That's
a good question.

00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:07.110
I would say a lot of the trends
that we're seeing are just

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:07.943
the timeless things.

00:41:07.943 --> 00:41:08.910
People are selfish.

00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:10.530
People are rude.

00:41:10.530 --> 00:41:12.990
People are greedy.

00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:14.850
People are scared.

00:41:14.850 --> 00:41:17.790
There's nothing that's happening
in this current election cycle

00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:20.520
that you couldn't find in
any history book, right?

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:22.980
Other than some of the
technical tools at which it's

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:24.340
being distributed by.

00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:26.380
It's like, the
more things change,

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:27.760
the more they stay the same.

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:31.045
So I think that you can focus
on these new little things that

00:41:31.045 --> 00:41:32.670
might be changing,
or you can just sort

00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:33.860
of look at the timeless.

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:38.850
People have been
what they do forever.

00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:41.770
So I just try not to spend that
much time thinking about it,

00:41:41.770 --> 00:41:43.290
right?

00:41:43.290 --> 00:41:47.610
I'd rather look at myself and
I'd rather look at the things

00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:50.340
that I need to improve
in my own life and lament

00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:55.900
that millennials aren't driving
enough cars, or buying houses,

00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:57.900
or whatever the things
that people get upset at.

00:41:57.900 --> 00:41:58.590
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Right.

00:41:58.590 --> 00:41:59.880
Things you have no power over.

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:00.796
RYAN HOLIDAY: Totally.

00:42:00.796 --> 00:42:04.950
And that might be a trend
or it might not be a trend.

00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:07.297
In Texas, where I
live, the first three

00:42:07.297 --> 00:42:08.880
years I lived there,
they were talking

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:10.350
about how there was a
drought all the time.

00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:12.750
And everywhere you go, people
talk about this drought.

00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:14.220
It's like that in
California now.

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:17.910
And then in one month,
the entire drought

00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:23.160
was erased with 30
days of straight rain.

00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:25.860
And so I felt kind of stupid
about how much time I thought

00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:27.450
about this drought, right?

00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:32.972
Because it's not a long
enough sample size, right?

00:42:32.972 --> 00:42:34.680
How do you know if
it's a drought or not?

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:38.040
So I think we tend to get
concerned and wrapped up

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:42.840
with these things that seem
big and seem like there's

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:44.250
enough evidence for them.

00:42:44.250 --> 00:42:46.800
But really, we're just
being very myopic.

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:47.580
JORDAN THIBODEAU: So
now at this point,

00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:49.121
I want to give the
audience students.

00:42:49.121 --> 00:42:51.660
Does anyone-- great.

00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:54.810
RYAN HOLIDAY: So he's asking
philosophy to most people

00:42:54.810 --> 00:42:57.660
seems academic and theoretical.

00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:02.501
Stoicism as a school is unique
and how eminently practical

00:43:02.501 --> 00:43:03.000
it is.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:03.840
AUDIENCE: And it isn't easy.

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:04.940
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah.

00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:07.521
It is and it isn't.

00:43:07.521 --> 00:43:08.770
I would encourage you to read.

00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:11.520
There's a book by a French
philosopher named Pierre Hadot.

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:13.760
It's called "Philosophy
as a Way of Life".

00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:16.230
He's basically
saying that stoicism

00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:19.980
in particular, but also
epicureanism and cynicism--

00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:23.100
these were not
systemic explanations

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:25.800
of the universe the way
that we think they are.

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:29.190
Like Marcus Aurelius
was writing meditations

00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:31.257
for his own private use.

00:43:31.257 --> 00:43:33.090
He had no idea that you
and I would read it.

00:43:33.090 --> 00:43:35.464
He probably thought it would
be destroyed upon his death,

00:43:35.464 --> 00:43:36.540
right?

00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:40.180
And you see this in
other philosophers.

00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:41.950
Think about it this way--

00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:44.970
"Nicomachean Ethics," which
is Aristotle's famous work,

00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:51.210
was his lecture notes
produced by his son.

00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:53.370
He's getting up there,
talking to a class

00:43:53.370 --> 00:43:54.377
about a lot of things.

00:43:54.377 --> 00:43:56.460
He's telling them what he
thinks they need to hear

00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:57.480
on that day or this day.

00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:03.510
It's not completely circular
definitive logical proof

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:04.170
for anything.

00:44:04.170 --> 00:44:06.480
It's just what this smart
guy was thinking about.

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:10.620
But I think if you start
to interpret philosophy

00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:14.400
as a way of solving
the problems of life--

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:17.760
Thoreau says this-- it's
to solve them practically,

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:19.360
not theoretically.

00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:21.330
And Epicurus says,
"Vain is the word

00:44:21.330 --> 00:44:24.570
of a philosopher which does
not heal the suffering of man."

00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:26.910
That's what philosophy,
I think, historically

00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:28.650
was supposed to be.

00:44:28.650 --> 00:44:31.500
I think there's a decent
amount of evidence for this.

00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:37.170
What happened as monotheism
and modern religion--

00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:40.240
it was sort of created
somewhat around the same time--

00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:45.000
Seneca and Christ are
alive at the same period--

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.089
we get this
distinction between--

00:44:47.089 --> 00:44:49.130
religion is how you're
supposed to live your life

00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:51.046
and what kind of person
you're supposed to be,

00:44:51.046 --> 00:44:53.340
and then philosophy is
what you study in school.

00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:57.156
But that distinction did
not exist previously.

00:44:57.156 --> 00:44:58.530
AUDIENCE: So my
question actually

00:44:58.530 --> 00:45:00.840
isn't about the writing.

00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:03.060
But more along the lines of--

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:05.070
I was really curious
because you had

00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:07.650
sort of a nontraditional path.

00:45:07.650 --> 00:45:12.910
And I was wondering how
you went from the thought

00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:15.960
to taking on something
new to taking action.

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:19.560
For example, leaving college,
taking a nontraditional path,

00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:20.920
writing your first book.

00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:24.337
How did you go from
speaking about it to action?

00:45:24.337 --> 00:45:26.670
RYAN HOLIDAY: I think the
thing that most people make up

00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:28.830
is that these changes--
they're epiphanies, right?

00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:32.670
Like, oh, I woke up and I knew
that this is what I had to do.

00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:35.130
I tend to find that these
life changing decisions are--

00:45:37.842 --> 00:45:42.500
Have you read Thomas
Kuhn's "Structure

00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:44.009
of Scientific Revolutions"?

00:45:44.009 --> 00:45:46.550
Basically, it's saying we think
that scientific breakthroughs

00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:48.960
are like Archimedes in the bath.

00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:50.150
Like, I've got it.

00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:53.330
In reality, it's a slow
accumulation that eventually

00:45:53.330 --> 00:45:55.590
destroys an existing paradigm.

00:45:55.590 --> 00:45:59.169
So you start to notice all
these anomalies and flaws.

00:45:59.169 --> 00:46:00.710
And over time and
then eventually you

00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:04.070
realize that the existing
explanation for a phenomenon

00:46:04.070 --> 00:46:06.560
no longer applies and you have
to come up with a new one.

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:07.910
I think it's like that.

00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:09.989
You think that this thing
was what you wanted,

00:46:09.989 --> 00:46:11.780
and you're working at
it, and you're going.

00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:13.520
But it's sort of accumulating.

00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:17.120
And you can shove those feelings
down or you can sort of put

00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:19.029
them over to the side and--

00:46:19.029 --> 00:46:19.570
what is this?

00:46:19.570 --> 00:46:20.444
I'm going to explore.

00:46:20.444 --> 00:46:23.000
And it's a process.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.220
It only looks clear
in retrospect.

00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:29.150
Like, it looks like I
dropped out of college,

00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:31.520
and I worked for this person,
and then I got this job,

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:33.110
and then I left that to do this.

00:46:33.110 --> 00:46:36.410
And obviously, when I'm writing
my bio on the back of my book,

00:46:36.410 --> 00:46:37.640
I only have four sentences.

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:41.270
I'm not-- and who
would have known?

00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:43.409
So that certainty--
you want to make sure

00:46:43.409 --> 00:46:44.950
you're not falling
for that certainty

00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:47.450
and that you allow
things to develop.

00:46:47.450 --> 00:46:50.835
And then at a certain
point, you do take risks.

00:46:50.835 --> 00:46:52.460
You've got to think
through those risks

00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:54.251
and make sure you're
comfortable with them.

00:46:54.251 --> 00:46:57.630
But I think I would say
it's not from epiphanies.

00:46:57.630 --> 00:47:01.090
It's not from any
sense of clarity.

00:47:01.090 --> 00:47:03.090
It's actually the opposite.

00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:06.732
It's, whatever is going on
right now is not working,

00:47:06.732 --> 00:47:08.690
so I'm going to try
something different or new.

00:47:08.690 --> 00:47:12.020
And that does end up
working for however long.

00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:14.989
AUDIENCE: So what do you think
was the most important thing

00:47:14.989 --> 00:47:16.280
you learned from Robert Greene?

00:47:19.610 --> 00:47:21.690
RYAN HOLIDAY: I would
say practically,

00:47:21.690 --> 00:47:24.980
it was learning how to
organize and make a book.

00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:29.630
Like he just taught me
the craft of writing.

00:47:29.630 --> 00:47:34.520
And then I would say as a
person, I think he taught me--

00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:37.980
I think I'm intense and
kind of high energy.

00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:40.330
Robert's very sort of
calm and dispassionate

00:47:40.330 --> 00:47:44.810
and he judges things
slowly and I don't

00:47:44.810 --> 00:47:46.520
feel like he's ever in a hurry.

00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:51.590
And so trying and
failing-- but I learned

00:47:51.590 --> 00:47:53.550
a lot from that example.

00:47:53.550 --> 00:47:56.450
AUDIENCE: What was your
favorite passage from your book?

00:47:56.450 --> 00:47:59.150
RYAN HOLIDAY: From my own book?

00:47:59.150 --> 00:48:03.290
That is a question
I've not thought about.

00:48:03.290 --> 00:48:06.787
There's a line in the intro.

00:48:06.787 --> 00:48:08.870
There's lines that you
think are your best writing

00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:11.630
and then sometimes you put
in things that are just you

00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:14.160
thinking you're being
clever or whatever.

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:16.421
But there's a line in
the interim where I say,

00:48:16.421 --> 00:48:18.170
when you finish this
book, I hope that you

00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:20.730
will think less of yourself.

00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:23.540
And I say I mean it in
both senses of the word.

00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:27.170
Like you'll just be thinking
of yourself less, but also,

00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:31.040
you won't think you're as great
as you currently think you are.

00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:34.750
So I think that's clever.

00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:36.170
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:48:36.170 --> 00:48:38.900
I read your book and I
have a question about one

00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:41.330
of the characters
in your chapters.

00:48:41.330 --> 00:48:45.080
Her name is Katharine Graham.

00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:46.850
RYAN HOLIDAY: Katharine Graham--

00:48:46.850 --> 00:48:48.740
she inherited the
Washington Post company.

00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:50.890
She was one of the
great female CEOs.

00:48:50.890 --> 00:48:54.434
Maybe greatest CEO
of the 20th century.

00:48:54.434 --> 00:48:55.100
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:58.310
So I was putting
myself in her shoes.

00:48:58.310 --> 00:49:00.982
She was facing a lot
of troubles and doubts

00:49:00.982 --> 00:49:03.440
from herself, probably, because
she doesn't have experience

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:05.390
before.

00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:08.960
So when do you draw the line
of pushing through, persevere,

00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:11.210
versus, maybe this
is not for me?

00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:13.880
I should just wash my hands
and go away and do something.

00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:17.000
I was maybe like, Michael
Jordan trying to play piano.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.710
It's not going to work out.

00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:20.110
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah.

00:49:20.110 --> 00:49:21.110
That's a great question.

00:49:21.110 --> 00:49:23.030
And I don't think
there's some rule-- it's

00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:25.850
like, here's the math equation
to know whether you should

00:49:25.850 --> 00:49:27.110
do this or not.

00:49:27.110 --> 00:49:29.750
There's a line from
Steven Pressfield I like.

00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:33.590
And he's saying--
what is he saying--

00:49:33.590 --> 00:49:38.900
remember that the counterfeiter
is wildly self-confident

00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:40.910
and the innovator
is scared to death.

00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:45.500
So in some ways, I think being
scared or uncertain about--

00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:49.400
I think if she had known, hey,
even though I've basically

00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:51.170
never worked a day
in my life, I just

00:49:51.170 --> 00:49:54.610
inherited this
multinational corporation,

00:49:54.610 --> 00:49:57.290
and I have no
experience, but I'm going

00:49:57.290 --> 00:49:59.010
to be the world's greatest CEO.

00:49:59.010 --> 00:50:01.190
I'm going to turn this
into hundreds and hundreds

00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:02.929
of millions of dollars
of personal wealth

00:50:02.929 --> 00:50:04.970
and people are going to
be writing books about me

00:50:04.970 --> 00:50:06.500
50 years from now.

00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:08.652
If she had thought that,
she would have been insane

00:50:08.652 --> 00:50:10.610
and she probably wouldn't
have been successful.

00:50:10.610 --> 00:50:13.730
So I think her doubts actually
fueled her being good,

00:50:13.730 --> 00:50:17.510
because if she thought she
knew what she was doing,

00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:19.630
she wouldn't have sought
out Warren Buffett

00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:20.920
and learned from him.

00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:24.360
And she wouldn't have
hired the right--

00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:26.380
So I think that those doubts--

00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:28.990
provided they're
not like, hey, I

00:50:28.990 --> 00:50:32.670
don't know how to swim, I
shouldn't jump in a pool--

00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:35.410
but provided that those
doubts are fueling

00:50:35.410 --> 00:50:38.250
you to learn and explore
and stuff like that,

00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:40.210
I think there can be positive.

00:50:40.210 --> 00:50:42.940
AUDIENCE: How do you know
when a decision is ego driven?

00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:45.490
It feels to me like
most of my decisions

00:50:45.490 --> 00:50:47.530
are partially ego driven.

00:50:47.530 --> 00:50:50.230
And I'm slightly
addicted or dependent

00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:51.640
on external validation.

00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:53.540
RYAN HOLIDAY: Sure.

00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:58.520
AUDIENCE: So how do you know--
is it like a 51-49 scale?

00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:00.520
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah, I
don't I don't know either.

00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:04.720
Look, I'm not saying egolessness
is possible or even desirable.

00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:08.440
But I'm saying that you should
be questioning and thinking

00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:10.570
about these things rather
than having it sort of be

00:51:10.570 --> 00:51:15.250
this silent thumb
on the scale skewing

00:51:15.250 --> 00:51:17.250
your decisions or
your priorities.

00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:22.660
Just because your
ego is lined up

00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:26.061
with something that doesn't mean
that it's the wrong decision,

00:51:26.061 --> 00:51:26.560
right?

00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:36.460
You wanted to start some
company to prove people wrong--

00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:37.930
that's not a great motivation.

00:51:37.930 --> 00:51:40.450
That doesn't say anything
about whether the ideas are

00:51:40.450 --> 00:51:42.622
good or bad, right?

00:51:42.622 --> 00:51:44.080
So I think what
you're trying to do

00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:46.750
is ultimately strip
ego out of the equation

00:51:46.750 --> 00:51:48.290
as much as possible.

00:51:48.290 --> 00:51:51.610
It's a process you get
better at it as you go.

00:51:51.610 --> 00:51:57.190
But generally, the
fewer emotional, knee

00:51:57.190 --> 00:52:01.540
jerk, insecure decisions
you make, the better.

00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:04.280
I don't think it adds
much to the decision.

00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:06.550
So if you can make
the right decision

00:52:06.550 --> 00:52:08.170
for sort of pure
objective reasons,

00:52:08.170 --> 00:52:11.980
obviously, that's better
than the egotistical reasons.

00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:13.660
AUDIENCE: What's
the most crazy thing

00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:15.560
that you've done
to market this book

00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:18.340
and what's the craziest, most
controversial thing you've

00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:21.930
seen in the last year
in terms of marketing?

00:52:21.930 --> 00:52:23.280
RYAN HOLIDAY: Craziest thing?

00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:28.941
I mean, I got the title
tattooed on my arm.

00:52:28.941 --> 00:52:29.440
What?

00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:30.070
AUDIENCE: Can we see?

00:52:30.070 --> 00:52:31.361
RYAN HOLIDAY: It's on this arm.

00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:40.290
I don't like that books
aren't fact checked.

00:52:40.290 --> 00:52:42.750
Even traditionally published
books aren't fact checked.

00:52:42.750 --> 00:52:44.670
So I'm driven crazy by the fact.

00:52:44.670 --> 00:52:46.810
There's this popular book
called "Eat That Frog"

00:52:46.810 --> 00:52:49.800
by this guy named Brian Tracy,
which is based on a Mark Twain

00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:53.260
quote about how you should
eat a frog every morning.

00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:55.570
Basically, do the most
difficult thing first.

00:52:55.570 --> 00:52:57.780
Except Mark Twain
didn't fucking say that.

00:53:00.166 --> 00:53:02.290
So it pisses me off that
someone could write a book

00:53:02.290 --> 00:53:02.915
and-- you know.

00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:10.480
So I wanted to write an article
about fact checking books.

00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:12.630
So I just paid someone
to fact check my own book

00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:15.720
so that I could write
an article about it.

00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:17.700
I didn't do anything
crazy for this book,

00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:22.470
partly because there's a
certain ego in marketing.

00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:27.420
And I wanted what I did for the
book to be true to the book.

00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:28.920
So I didn't do
anything crazy like I

00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:31.900
have for some of my other books,
but I might in the future.

00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:33.840
AUDIENCE: I dig your writing.

00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:36.060
I was curious with--

00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:38.790
Robert Greene was your
mentor and he wrote books

00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:40.770
like "The 48 Laws of Power."

00:53:40.770 --> 00:53:44.460
And so that seems to
be a certain mindset.

00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:48.840
And I wonder if you absorb that
way of looking at the world,

00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:51.510
then maybe that will tend you
towards thinking of things

00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:54.060
in an ego centered way.

00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:56.749
So I'm curious how
you'd respond to that.

00:53:56.749 --> 00:53:57.540
RYAN HOLIDAY: Sure.

00:53:57.540 --> 00:54:02.040
I mean I do think it's important
that you don't psychoanalyze

00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:04.030
an author and their book, right?

00:54:04.030 --> 00:54:10.170
So Robert Greene says
that his books are amoral.

00:54:10.170 --> 00:54:10.960
He's not saying.

00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:12.260
This is how you should be.

00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:15.150
He's saying these are
the rules of power--

00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:20.530
choose the ones you want
or don't want, right?

00:54:20.530 --> 00:54:23.080
So having known him and
having worked with him,

00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:27.070
I've seen that he is
not a ruthless, cunning,

00:54:27.070 --> 00:54:31.030
exploitative, evil
person, right?

00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:36.010
So I think understanding
how power works historically

00:54:36.010 --> 00:54:41.470
and seeing the levers by
which people come to power

00:54:41.470 --> 00:54:42.650
is neither good or bad.

00:54:42.650 --> 00:54:44.590
It's just fact.

00:54:44.590 --> 00:54:50.350
And then you decide, based
on your own moral compass,

00:54:50.350 --> 00:54:52.900
how and whether you want to
follow in their footsteps

00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:53.830
at all.

00:54:53.830 --> 00:54:58.090
So, you know,
Robert Green writes,

00:54:58.090 --> 00:55:00.850
"Let others do all the work,
and take all the credit," right?

00:55:00.850 --> 00:55:02.380
Well I was his
research assistant

00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:03.960
and people know about it.

00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:08.230
So obviously, he was actually
very generous with the credit

00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:12.280
that he gave me and has
been a great supporter.

00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:15.580
And so I think
knowing how things

00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:20.230
tend to work sociologically
or historically--

00:55:20.230 --> 00:55:22.862
it doesn't mean you
have to live by them.

00:55:22.862 --> 00:55:23.820
AUDIENCE: Thanks, Ryan.

00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:25.060
RYAN HOLIDAY: Thank you.

00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:27.130
AUDIENCE: Obviously, you
are clearly well-read.

00:55:27.130 --> 00:55:30.730
What is your strategy for
being a better reader?

00:55:33.409 --> 00:55:35.450
RYAN HOLIDAY: OK, so I'll
say a couple of things.

00:55:35.450 --> 00:55:37.510
I'll just vomit out some
thoughts on reading.

00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:39.280
Speed reading is not a thing.

00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:40.660
Stop chasing it, right?

00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:43.287
It's supposed to
take a long time.

00:55:43.287 --> 00:55:44.620
There's no way around it, right?

00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:49.270
You don't think about how to
speed up sex or eating, right?

00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:52.360
These are things
you savor and enjoy.

00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:58.780
I would say that I made a
decision early on in my life--

00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:00.760
it's like, hey, I read
this thing in a book

00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:02.620
and then I applied it at work.

00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:05.860
So why am I pretending
that reading

00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:08.350
is what I do at home
in my private time,

00:56:08.350 --> 00:56:13.180
and then work is when I sit at
a computer and read it all day?

00:56:13.180 --> 00:56:16.720
So the idea that reading
is part of my job,

00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:18.360
I'm going to make time--

00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:22.070
if I decide at 2:00 PM to spend
two and a half hours reading,

00:56:22.070 --> 00:56:25.100
I don't consider that
me messing around.

00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:26.590
That's work.

00:56:26.590 --> 00:56:29.950
And it's not simply just
taking in information.

00:56:29.950 --> 00:56:31.220
You have to do something.

00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:35.830
You have to have some process
for synthesizing and organizing

00:56:35.830 --> 00:56:37.940
and storing this information.

00:56:37.940 --> 00:56:40.190
Otherwise, you're just
relying on memorizing it.

00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:41.440
And I'm not a great memorizer.

00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:44.860
So I organize it
all by note cards.

00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:46.135
Some people use Evernote.

00:56:46.135 --> 00:56:47.510
I think you also
have to organize

00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:49.870
this information in some way.

00:56:49.870 --> 00:56:53.820
And then I just
genuinely love reading.

00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:54.940
It's my favorite thing.

00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:58.240
And I would say the other thing
is I don't schedule reading.

00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:00.720
I know some people are
like, I read 50 pages a day.

00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:01.720
That might work for you.

00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:03.070
I'm more of like a binge reader.

00:57:03.070 --> 00:57:05.800
So I might read
four books in a week

00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:07.900
and then not read
a book in a week,

00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:09.150
depending on how I have time.

00:57:09.150 --> 00:57:10.880
And I use travel.

00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:12.790
I don't watch movies
on an airplane.

00:57:12.790 --> 00:57:15.060
I read books, you know?

00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:16.460
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:57:16.460 --> 00:57:16.720
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Great.

00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:18.200
Well Ryan, thank
you for everything.

00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:18.620
RYAN HOLIDAY: Thank
you for having me.

00:57:18.620 --> 00:57:20.828
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Let's give
him a round of applause.

00:57:20.828 --> 00:57:22.210
[APPLAUSE]
