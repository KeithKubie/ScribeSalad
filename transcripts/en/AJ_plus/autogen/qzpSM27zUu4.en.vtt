00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.660
The U.S. is pushing Mexico to get tougher on its southern border, with dangerous consequences.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.040
The U.S. pushed Mexico to do its dirty job of keeping people from reaching our border

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.860
and trying to request protection here.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.440
There’s been a lot of focus on the Trump administration’s immigration policy.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.480
The Trump administration has been lying about this policy and downplaying the deliberate child abuse.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.800
At its capacity, this place could house up to 4,000 children.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.160
And if children get caught up in the fallout of that, according to the attorney general, so be it.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.980
And despite President Trump’s claims,

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.440
They flow right through Mexico, they send them into the United States.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.160
Mexico actually deports more Central American people than the U.S. does, and has done so since 2015.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.580
The fact that there was a lot of pressure on Mexico to do something that they probably weren't equipped to do,

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.620
really is concerning in terms of what this has meant for a very vulnerable population

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.720
of Central American migrants mostly, who have been fleeing their homes seeking protection

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:59.620
in the past few years.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.100

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.180
Hi guys, I’m Daniel and this Sunday we’re going to be talking about the other Mexican border

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.860
and how the U.S. is supporting Mexico’s efforts to control immigration from Central America.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.260

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.100
Those are just a few of the reasons people along Mexico’s border with Guatemala

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.220
told us why they decided to leave home.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.300
However, most refugees and migrants will never make it to the U.S. border.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.820
That’s because starting in 2014 there was a dramatic jump in the number of them arrested in Mexico.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.200
To understand why there’s been this increase in arrests, we need to talk about Programa Frontera Sur,

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.840
or as it’s known in English, the Southern Border Plan.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.160
Frontera Sur is the Mexican government’s program to step-up immigration enforcement,

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.180
particularly in southern Mexico.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.560

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.480
It was announced in July 2014 by Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto after tens of thousands of children

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.520
fleeing violence arrived at the U.S. border.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.500
President Obama declared it a humanitarian crisis.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.100
And earlier this week, Mexico announced a series of steps that they're going to take on their southern border

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.900
to help stem the tide of these unaccompanied children.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.160
Obama, by the way, has been called “deporter-in-chief” by undocumented immigrant advocacy groups.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.800
Maureen Meyer at WOLA, the Washington Office of Latin America, says

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.500
that while Mexico was already arresting Central American refugees and migrants prior to Frontera Sur,

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.220
this was significant because it was a conscious decision by Mexico to work more closely with the U.S.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.760
Lots of phone calls were made and requests made from the United States to Mexico saying,

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.340
“You need to help us address the Central American migration” and really pressuring Mexico

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.060
to step up enforcement as a way to reduce the number of Central Americans reaching the U.S. border.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.140
Initially, Peña Nieto said that part of Frontera Sur would promote and protect migrant rights.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:52.060

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.760
I think if that was the aim, it's failed miserably.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.840
If the objective was more to detain and deport Central Americans and others, then they've had a lot of success.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.840
A quick look at the nature of U.S. involvement might give you an idea of what’s shaped the policies of Frontera Sur.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.640
WOLA says that since 2014 there’s probably been $200 million allocated to Mexico for southern border security.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.680
Now, what this looks like on the ground is funding for setting up communications towers

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.640
along the border that enable Mexico security agencies and the immigration agency to better communicate,

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.820
to improved biometric equipment for Mexico's immigration agency,

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.680
so you know who's going through your detention centers and the ports of entry.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.480
WOLA even found that ICE, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency,

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.040
maintains a presence at a detention center in Tapachula, Mexico that houses children.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.720
Besides sending those fleeing violence back into potentially dangerous situations in their home countries,

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.360
Frontera Sur may actually be putting them more at risk on their journey.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.180
Just listen to some of their stories.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:57.720

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.320

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.300
The crackdown has pushed travellers into more remote, more dangerous parts of the country

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.780
-- a country that’s getting more unsafe for everybody.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.660
Mexico’s population is a little over one-third of the United States’

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.720
and in 2017 there was a record 29,000 homicides in Mexico, the highest number since

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.640
the country’s modern record-keeping began.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.200
That means in Mexico for every 100,000 people,

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.960
more than 20 of them were murdered.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.960
In the U.S. that number was closer to just five,

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.880
meaning Mexico’s murder rate is nearly four times higher.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.100
Crimes and abuses against people travelling through Mexico continue at an alarming rate,

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:58.080
and according to WOLA, shelters have noted a more intense degree of violence in the reported cases.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.320
And there have been reports of alleged verbal and physical abuse by Mexican officials,

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.360
even using Taser guns to threaten and control them.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.240
Migrants are frequently kidnapped, extorted, robbed.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.380
Often women are sexually assaulted both by criminal organizations,

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.040
but sometimes in collusion with Mexican officials.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:21.380
And we have not seen any significant effort by Mexican authorities to curtail those abuses.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.880
The U.S. may have played a larger role in making Mexico more dangerous.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:29.000
Diego Lorente says the policy of dealing with migration as an issue of national security

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.860
actually goes pretty far back.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.240

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.880
This focus on security began after the 9/11 attacks,

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:58.420
when former Mexican President Vicente Fox and then U.S. President George W. Bush decided to cooperate

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.980
more closely on matters of national security.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.020
Mexico established Plan South, a system of police and

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.880
military surveillance. It also started deferring to the U.S.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.760
on issues relating to the southern border.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.740
Then in 2007 came the Mérida Initiative.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.960
The U.S. signed on to support the purchase of military equipment and training

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.580
as part of Mexico’s newly declared war on drugs.

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:22.260
Under Mérida, the U.S. has allocated over $2 billion in aid to Mexico in the past decade.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:27.580
And $100 million of that has gone to Mexico’s National Institute of Migration since 2014.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:32.240
Mérida is highly controversial. Critics say it has only made the situation worse.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.780
The strategy coincided with the militarization of public security in Mexico,

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:39.660
in part stemming from an enormous increase in firearm sales from the U.S.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:44.980
WOLA and human rights organizations have even gone so far as to call on the U.S. to withhold aid from Mexico

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.300
because they’re concerned about the human rights situation.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:52.820
It's a very dangerous situation where Mexico’s in right now because you have military in roles that don't

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:58.400
correspond to them, and a lot of times leads to abuses against the civilian population or others that they

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:04.440
encounter with very weak accountability mechanisms, so really weak efforts to investigate any soldier involved

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.520
in crimes or human rights violations against their population.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.300
And there’s another way the U.S. has contributed to this crisis.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:15.260
Many of the reasons Central Americans are fleeing their home countries stem from decades of U.S. intervention.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:19.820
Take, for example, the wars in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua in the 1980s.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:23.780
The U.S. spent billions funding these wars in an effort to stop the spread of communism

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.780
– and the effects are still felt today.

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:29.500
Gangs like MS-13 were made in the U.S.A. They were actually started by

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:33.560
Central Americams who fled U.S.-sponsored civil wars in the 1980s.

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:37.960
In the 90s, President Bill Clinton’s policy made it easier for people to be deported,

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.500
which sent these gangs back to Central America.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:45.520
Today, countries like El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras are among the most violent in the world.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:50.480

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.100
I'm actually Salvadoran-American.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.940
And my family fled the war in El Salvador in the 1980s.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.760
What other stories about Central America should we cover?
