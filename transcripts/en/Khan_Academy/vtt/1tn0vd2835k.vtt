00:00:00.145 --> 00:00:01.748
- This video we're going to try to get

00:00:01.748 --> 00:00:04.058
a sense of what the limit
as x approaches three

00:00:04.058 --> 00:00:06.463
of x to the third minus three x squared

00:00:06.463 --> 00:00:09.166
over five x minus 15

00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:10.253
is.

00:00:10.253 --> 00:00:11.799
Now when I say get a sense,

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:14.843
we're gonna do that by seeing what

00:00:14.843 --> 00:00:17.882
values for this expression
we get as x gets

00:00:17.882 --> 00:00:20.289
closer and closer to three.

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:22.113
Now one thing that you
might wanna try out is,

00:00:22.113 --> 00:00:24.412
well what happens to this expression

00:00:24.412 --> 00:00:26.566
when x is equal to three?

00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:29.184
Well then it's going to be
three to the third power

00:00:29.184 --> 00:00:32.316
minus three times three squared,

00:00:32.316 --> 00:00:34.855
over five times three

00:00:34.855 --> 00:00:35.688
minus 15.

00:00:36.542 --> 00:00:39.264
So at x equals three, this
expression's gonna be,

00:00:39.264 --> 00:00:42.689
let's see in the numerator
you have 27 minus 27, zero.

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:45.601
Over 15 minus 15, over zero.

00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:48.753
So this expression is actually not defined

00:00:48.753 --> 00:00:50.164
at x equals three.

00:00:50.164 --> 00:00:51.516
We get this indeterminate form,

00:00:51.516 --> 00:00:54.026
we get zero over zero.

00:00:54.026 --> 00:00:55.652
But let's see, even though the function,

00:00:55.652 --> 00:00:57.785
or even though the
expression is not defined,

00:00:57.785 --> 00:01:01.930
let's see if we can get a sense
of what the limit might be.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.210
And to do that, I'm gonna set up a table.

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.710
So let me set up a table here.

00:01:08.818 --> 00:01:11.190
And actually I wanna set up two tables.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.940
So this is x and this is x to the third

00:01:16.323 --> 00:01:18.735
minus three x squared

00:01:18.735 --> 00:01:19.943
over

00:01:19.943 --> 00:01:21.467
five x

00:01:21.467 --> 00:01:22.300
minus

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.430
15.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.820
And actually, I'm gonna do that again.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.158
And I'll tell you why in a second.

00:01:27.158 --> 00:01:31.424
So this is gonna be x and
this is x to the third

00:01:31.424 --> 00:01:34.001
minus three x squared

00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:34.859
over

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:37.272
five x minus 15.

00:01:37.272 --> 00:01:38.440
The reason why I set up two tables,

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.547
I didn't have to do two tables,

00:01:39.547 --> 00:01:40.848
I could have done it all in one table,

00:01:40.848 --> 00:01:42.268
but hopefully this will make it

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:44.578
a little bit more intuitive
what I'm trying to do.

00:01:44.578 --> 00:01:48.325
Is on this left table, I'm
gonna, let's try out x values

00:01:48.325 --> 00:01:52.072
that get closer and closer
to three from the left.

00:01:52.072 --> 00:01:54.163
From values that are less than three.

00:01:54.163 --> 00:01:56.635
So for example, you can
go to two point nine

00:01:56.635 --> 00:01:58.484
and figure out what the expression equals

00:01:58.484 --> 00:01:59.824
when x is two point nine.

00:01:59.824 --> 00:02:01.296
But then we can try to get
even a little bit closer

00:02:01.296 --> 00:02:05.726
than that, we could go
to two point nine nine.

00:02:05.726 --> 00:02:06.997
And then we could go
even closer than that.

00:02:06.997 --> 00:02:10.330
We could go to two point nine nine nine.

00:02:11.475 --> 00:02:13.255
And so one way to think about it here

00:02:13.255 --> 00:02:16.241
is as we try to figure out
what this expression equals

00:02:16.241 --> 00:02:18.455
as we get closer and closer to three,

00:02:18.455 --> 00:02:22.215
we're trying to approximate
the limit from the left.

00:02:22.215 --> 00:02:23.048
So limit

00:02:24.621 --> 00:02:25.454
from

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:27.323
the left.

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:29.738
Now why do I say the left?

00:02:29.738 --> 00:02:31.973
Well if you think about
this on a coordinate plane,

00:02:31.973 --> 00:02:34.292
these are the x values that
are to the left of three,

00:02:34.292 --> 00:02:36.141
but we're getting closer
and closer and closer.

00:02:36.141 --> 00:02:37.432
We're moving to the right,

00:02:37.432 --> 00:02:39.038
but these are the x values that

00:02:39.038 --> 00:02:42.429
are on the left side of three,
they're less than three.

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:44.828
But we also, in order
for the limit to exist,

00:02:44.828 --> 00:02:47.693
we have to be approaching the
same thing from both sides.

00:02:47.693 --> 00:02:49.420
From both the left and the right.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.045
So we could also try to approximate

00:02:51.045 --> 00:02:52.212
the limit from

00:02:53.775 --> 00:02:55.159
the right.

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:56.926
And so what values would those be?

00:02:56.926 --> 00:02:59.030
Well those would be,
those would be x values

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.656
larger than three.

00:03:00.656 --> 00:03:02.573
So we could say three point one,

00:03:02.573 --> 00:03:03.927
but then we might wanna
get a little bit closer,

00:03:03.927 --> 00:03:05.776
we could go three point zero one.

00:03:05.776 --> 00:03:07.735
But then we might wanna
get even closer to three.

00:03:07.735 --> 00:03:09.953
Three point zero zero

00:03:09.953 --> 00:03:10.797
one.

00:03:10.797 --> 00:03:12.431
And every time we get
closer and closer to three,

00:03:12.431 --> 00:03:15.226
we're gonna get a better
approximation for,

00:03:15.226 --> 00:03:16.872
or we're gonna get a better sense

00:03:16.872 --> 00:03:19.920
of what we are actually approaching.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.403
So let's get a calculator out and do this.

00:03:21.403 --> 00:03:23.870
And you could keep going,
two nine nine nine nine nine.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.633
Three point zero zero zero zero one.

00:03:26.633 --> 00:03:28.929
Now one key idea here to point out,

00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:31.062
before I even calculate
what these are going to be,

00:03:31.062 --> 00:03:33.479
sometimes when people say
the limit from both sides,

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:35.796
or the limit from the left
or the limit from the right,

00:03:35.796 --> 00:03:37.523
they imagine that the limit from the left

00:03:37.523 --> 00:03:39.586
is negative values and
the limit from the right

00:03:39.586 --> 00:03:40.996
are positive values.

00:03:40.996 --> 00:03:43.203
But as you can see here,
the limit from the left

00:03:43.203 --> 00:03:46.645
are to the left of the x
value that you're trying

00:03:46.645 --> 00:03:48.454
to find the limit at.

00:03:48.454 --> 00:03:50.172
So these aren't negative values,

00:03:50.172 --> 00:03:52.477
these are just approaching the three

00:03:52.477 --> 00:03:54.995
right over here from
values less than three.

00:03:54.995 --> 00:03:56.418
This is approaching the three

00:03:56.418 --> 00:03:58.918
from values larger than three.

00:04:00.015 --> 00:04:01.855
So now let's fill out this table,

00:04:01.855 --> 00:04:04.261
and I'm speeding up my
work so that you don't

00:04:04.261 --> 00:04:06.162
have to sit through me typing everything

00:04:06.162 --> 00:04:07.662
into a calculator.

00:04:08.833 --> 00:04:10.795
So based on what we're seeing here,

00:04:10.795 --> 00:04:13.688
I would make the estimate that this looks

00:04:13.688 --> 00:04:16.484
like it's approaching one point eight.

00:04:16.484 --> 00:04:18.434
So is this equal to one point eight?

00:04:18.434 --> 00:04:20.168
As I said, in the future, we're gonna

00:04:20.168 --> 00:04:21.998
be able to find this out exactly.

00:04:21.998 --> 00:04:23.310
But if you're not sure about this

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.724
you could try an even closer
and closer and closer value.
