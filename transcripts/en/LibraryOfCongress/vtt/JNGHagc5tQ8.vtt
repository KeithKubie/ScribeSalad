00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.510
&gt;&gt; Daniele Turello: Good afternoon.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.810
I am Dan Turello.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.230
I'm on the staff of
the Kluge Center.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.710
Welcome to our program today.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.200 position:56%
Before we begin I want to remind you
to please turn off any cellphones

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.130
or other electronic devices that
might interfere with the program.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.230
I also want to remind you that
we're filming today's lecture

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:47.670
for presentation on our website and
our YouTube and iTunes channels.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.710
This afternoon's program
is being presented

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.330
by the John W. Kluge Center.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.750
The Kluge Center is
a vibrant community

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.780
of scholars on Capitol Hill.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.180
We bring together researchers
from around the world

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.790
to energize one another, to use
the Library's rich collections

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.180
and to interact with
policymakers and the public.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.910
The Center offers opportunities
for scholars at every level,

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.210
from the senior scholars,

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.060
to our post-doctoral
fellows, to PhD candidates.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.630
And we are grateful for this
rich and enlightening community.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.860
We're happy to have Sarah
Cameron back with us today.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.560
Dr. Cameron was a Kluge
Fellow earlier in the year.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.210
And the title of her lecture today
will be "The Hungry Steppe, Famine,

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.730
Violence, and the Making
of Soviet Kazakhstan."

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.460
While she was here at the Library,

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.670
Dr. Cameron analyzed
a little-known episode

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.500
of Stalinist social engineering.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:54.510
It was a tragic event, the Kazakh
famine of 1930 to 1933 which led

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.360
to the death of more than 1 1/2
million people, which was close

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.020
to a quarter of Soviet
Kazakhstan's population.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.750
And today Dr. Cameron will be using
memoirs, oral history account,

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.250
archival documents to explore
the stories of those who lived

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.310
through the famine, asking how this
crisis reshaped Soviet Kazakhstan,

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.980
and what it meant to be
Kazakh, and how the case

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.060
of the Kazakh famine alters
understanding of development

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.080
and nation-building under Stalin.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.920
Dr. Cameron is Assistant
Professor of History

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.690
at the University of Maryland.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.530
She's a historian of
Russia and the Soviet Union,

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.840
has a particular interest
in the societies

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.000
and cultures of Central Asia.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.250
In addition to her Kluge Center
Fellowship, she's been a Fellow

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.790
at the Rachel Carson Center for the
Environment and Society in Munich

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.010
and the Woodrow Wilson
International Center for Scholars.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.320
Her research has been supported

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.140
by the Harry Frank
Guggenheim Foundation,

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.770
ACLS Mellon, Fulbright, and others.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.150
She received her PhD
from Yale University

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.350
where her dissertation won
the John Addison Porter Prize

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.120
for the best dissertation
in the Arts and Sciences

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.030
and the Turner Prize for the
most outstanding dissertation

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.640
in European History.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.540
So please join me in
welcoming Dr. Sarah Cameron.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.510
She'll speak for --

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:28.250
[ Applause ]

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.680
-- will speak for about 40 minutes,

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.280
and then we'll have
a time of Q and A.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.010
&gt;&gt; Sarah Cameron: Okay, thank you.

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.800
Thank you very much for
that kind introduction.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.500
Can all of you hear me okay?

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.800
Okay, excellent.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.940
It's a great pleasure
to speak here today.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.070
And it was a great pleasure to
be a Fellow at the Kluge Center

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.710
from January through
July of this past year.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.510
I have many thank yous.

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.960
I'd like to -- before I start,
I'd like to thank you --

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.550
thank the other Fellows
that I met along the way

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.590
for very lively conversations, for
making my time here so enjoyable.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.200
And in particular, I'd like
to thank the entire staff

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.700
of the Kluge Center, particular
Mary Lou Reker, Travis Hensley,

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.250
Jason Steinhauer, and Dan Turello
who were just absolutely wonderful

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.880
and made my stay here so enjoyable.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.470
Finally, I'd like to thank the
subject area librarians who went

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.630
out of their way to track down
hard-to-find books and materials

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.020
in Russian and in Kazakh.

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:24.130 position:56%
I'd particularly like to thank Harry
Leich in the European Reading Room

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.400
and Joan Weeks in the African and
in the Middle East Reading Room.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.150 position:56%
As I'll detail in my talk today, the
books that I found during my stay

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.930
as a Kluge Fellow greatly
enriched my research.

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.650
And I found actually a number of
materials here that I had not found

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.650
in either Russia or in Kazakhstan.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.620
In the early 1990s, Zhe
Abashuli [assumed spelling] spoke

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.650
about his memories of the
Kazakh famine of 1930 to '33,

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.440
a crisis which transformed the
new Soviet Republic of Kazakhstan.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.870 position:56%
"I was still a child, but I could
not forget this," Abashuli recalled.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.540
"My bones are shaking as these
memories come into my mind."

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:05.880
During the famine, activists

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.280 position:56%
with the Soviet regime had stripped
Abashuli's family of their livestock

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.480
and grain, and starving people
fled in every direction.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.040
His father's relatives
had fled to Soviet --

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:21.580 position:56%
had fled Soviet Kazakhstan entirely,
escaping across the border to China.

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.920
"For those who remained,"
Abashuli concluded,

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.320 position:56%
"hunger was, quote, a silent enemy."

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.750
He remembered the arba,
or horse-drawn cart

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.290
that collected the bodies
of the dead and dumped them

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.470
in mass burial grounds on
the outskirts of settlements.

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.120
Later, during World War II,
Abashuli would go on to fight

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.390 position:56%
on the front lines for the Red Army.

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.290
Nonetheless, he concluded, quote,

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:46.010
"surviving a famine is not
less than surviving a war."

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.680
Another survivor of the
Kazakh famine of 1930 to '33,

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.250
Nersha Tan Abdahanuli
[assumed spelling],

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.310
then a seven-year-old boy, recalled

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.320
that he had seen several
family members die

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.860
of hunger before his
eyes in the fall of 1932.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.240
Other relatives, he heard, perished
in a mountain valley as they fled

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.050
across the border from
Kazakhstan to Kyrgyzstan.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:14.260
"In early 1933," he recalled, "the
real black clouds of hunger came."

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.910
Abdahanuli's family moved south
to Uzanarash [assumed spelling]

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.970
where his father took
a position as a head

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.360 position:56%
of district inspectorate commission.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.070
Though Adbahanuli's grandmother
had warned him to stay hidden

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:27.770
under blankets during the journey
-- children could be kidnapped

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:29.910
and eaten by the starving --

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:32.290
Abdahanuli peeked out
from underneath,

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:35.170
and he saw corpses
scattered across the ground,

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.570
hints of the horrors
that lay beyond.

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:42.440 position:56%
As the recollections of these famine
survivors reveal, the period 1930

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.710
to '33 was a time of almost
unimaginable suffering

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.150
in the Soviet Republic
of Kazakhstan.

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:52.490
In 1929 Josef Stalin had
launched the first five-year plan,

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:56.120
a radical scheme to help the Soviet
Union industrialize, secure control

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.900
over the food supply, and catch
up to the capitalist West.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.380
Via collectivization, Moscow
sought to bring the food supply,

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.570
including the production
of meat and grain,

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.840
firmly into the grasp of the state.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.420
In the Soviet Union's West, and
particularly in places like Ukraine

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:14.220
and in the Volga, Don,
and Kuban areas of Russia

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:17.980 position:56%
which had large numbers of peasants,
devastating famines broke out,

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:19.770
taking millions of lives.

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.990
But if in the Soviet Union's west
collectivization took the form

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:26.280
of a war on peasant life, in
Kazakhstan it took the form

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.320
of a war on nomadic life.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.730
Through this project Moscow
sought to eliminate the economic

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:35.460
and cultural hallmarks of nomadism,
permanently settle the Kazakhs,

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.320
and integrate them into
the collectivist whole.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.240
The resultant crisis in Kazakhstan
upended lives and families,

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.830
and it left a devastating
trail of sorrow in its wake.

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:50.280
Ultimately by the famine's
end in 1934, Moscow succeeded

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.500
in eliminating nomadism,
a goal of the campaign.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.450
With their livelihood in
ruins, Kazakhs were forced

00:07:56.450 --> 00:08:00.390
to abandon their nomadic way
of nomadism for a settled one.

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:02.490
This marked a really
profound rupture

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:04.800
in this region, the Kazakh Steppe.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.480
Pastoral nomadism had
been the predominant way

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.480
of life actually for
over 4 millennia.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.230 position:56%
It's difficult to determine an exact
death toll for the Kazakh famine

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:18.320
of 1930 to '33, yet it
is clear by any measure

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.750
that the loss of life
was staggering.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:24.140
Out of the total population
of 6.5 million people,

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.510
perhaps 1 1/2 million people,

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:30.690
roughly 1/4 of the republic's
population, perish in this famine.

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:34.520
Decimated by the crisis, Kazakhs
actually become a minority

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.580
in their own Soviet republic.

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:38.420
For the remainder of
the Soviet period,

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:41.130
Kazakhs occupied a
very curious status.

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:43.410
There were at once the
titular nationality,

00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:47.220
and at the same time
actually an ethnic minority.

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:51.140
Only in 1999, eight years
after the Soviet collapse,

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:54.900
did Kazakhs regain the demographic
majority in what is now known

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:58.880
as the Republic of Kazakhstan,
an independent country.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:02.050
Today I'll be speaking about this
disaster, which is the subject

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:04.580
of a book project that
I'm working on.

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:08.080
I'll provide an overview of
the disaster, its major events,

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.370
and its consequences
for Kazakh society.

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.390
More generally, the
Kazakh famine is a topic

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:15.310
that is little-known in the West.

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:16.750
It's almost entirely missing

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:20.010
from major scholarly
overviews of the Soviet period.

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:22.170
And though the disaster
has major bearing

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:24.880
on how we understand the
nature of Stalin's rule,

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.620
and arguably even the violent
course of the 20th century itself,

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.260
the disaster's major events

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.390
and causal factors are
not well-understood.

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:36.320
Indeed, as I discuss in an
epilogue to my book the case

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:40.380
of the Kazakh famine in fact raises
broad questions about why it is

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:44.180
that we remember or we forget
certain episodes of mass violence,

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:48.090
and how it is that this particular
episode came to be excluded

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:50.720 position:56%
from our understanding of Stalinism.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.680
When it is published, I hope that
my book will remedy this gap,

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.800
becoming one of the
first complete accounts

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.470
of the Kazakh famine in the West.

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:02.010
The major thrust of the book as I
see it is bringing this story --

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:04.510
long-neglected story to light.

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:08.410
But it's also to ask how this
disaster, once it's reinserted back

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:12.390
into our understanding of Soviet
history, alters our understanding

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:15.250
of Soviet modernization
and nation-building.

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:18.360
In my research I explore the
elements of these two projects,

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.780
Soviet nation-building
and Soviet modernity,

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:22.740
as they unfolded in Kazakhstan.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:26.440
I probe the frequent tensions
that occurred as the Soviets tried

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.650
to realize these two at
times contradictory aims.

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:32.920
The project of Soviet modernity
was, of course, universal,

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:36.510
the attempt to make a --
all societies communist.

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:39.000
While the project of
Soviet nation-making,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.120
on the other hand,
was particularistic.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.870
It held that each nation, whether
Kazakhs, Uzbeks, or Ukrainians,

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:48.180
had a particular culture, language,
territory, and history that needed

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.410
to be supported and promoted.

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:53.250
I argue that the Kazakh famine
was the result of Moscow's attempt

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:56.690
to make Kazakhs into a
modern Soviet nation.

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:59.330
Like several other recent
works, I challenge the idea

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.950
that Soviet nation-making
was progressive.

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:03.810
Rather, I show that this process

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:07.170
of nation-making was a very
violent one, one which often served

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:10.670
to reinforce rather than
contradict the regime's aims

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.710
of economic transformation.

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:15.020
I illustrated its participatory
nature,

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:18.280
showing how many Kazakhs became
involved in this violent campaign

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.940
to transform their own society.

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:25.280 position:56%
But not all of the regime's efforts
at nation-building were anticipated.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.130
As I'll show in my talk today,

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:30.060
the language of nationality
was a powerful tool,

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:33.720
one which Moscow could not
always control as it wished.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.300
On the subject of modernity I
try to provide a counterweight

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.930
to a literature that is focused
largely in the Soviet Union's West.

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:41.570
Not only were the peoples
and cultures

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:43.190
of this region quite different,

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:45.750
but the physical environment
was also distinct,

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:48.120
as I'll highlight in my talk today.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:51.100
It is only in places such as
Soviet Kazakhstan, I argue,

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:53.000
that we can understand
the full extent

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.760
of what Soviet modernization
actually was.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.970
Here the distance to
modernize, so to speak,

00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:02.300
this effort to transform not just
peasants but nomads was greater

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.270
than in the Soviet Union's West.

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:07.080
And the consequences of these
attempts would be more dramatic.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:11.080
As I'll illustrate in my talk,
collectivization was a policy

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.380
that was a policy that
was repressive,

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:15.970
both of the human toll it
exacted, as well as self-defeating.

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:17.970
In the aftermath of the famine,

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:21.770
the republic underwent a
total economic collapse.

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:25.760 position:56%
My findings are based upon
extensive field work in both Russian

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:29.650
and in Kazakhstan [inaudible] state
and in Communist Party archives.

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:32.820
It's also based upon some
exciting discoveries that I made

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:36.860
at the Library of Congress here,
and I'll show you some examples.

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:41.110
One of the challenges I faced
in telling this story is getting

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:43.070 position:56%
at the voices of Kazakhs themselves.

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:47.470
As I've hinted, Kazakhs were a
nomadic society in this period.

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:50.400
They were largely an oral
rather than a literary culture,

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.740
and it's very difficult

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:54.730
to find sources written
by Kazakhs themselves.

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:56.420
The sources about Kazakh life

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:59.160
that do exist are largely
ethnographic accounts,

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.910
Communist Party documents.

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:03.830
They are settled people's
observations of the nomadic world,

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:06.600
and thus they have to be
read with some caution.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.730
Many officials looked
at nomadic light

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:11.580
through the lens of
evolutionary theory.

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:15.080
The oral history accounts that
I quoted at the beginning come

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.730
from the volume in the center,

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:19.280
"Quzildar Qorqinis" [assumed
spelling], "Red Terror,"

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.810
a volume that I've
actually only ever seen

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:23.110
at the Library of Congress.

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:25.220
It's pictured in the center.

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:29.950
And these oral history accounts
were actually collected in 1991,

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:33.100
right after the Soviet Union
collapsed, when survivors

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:37.120
of the famine were finally able
to talk about the disaster openly.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.990
These materials offer a
really invaluable insight

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:44.870
into the human side of the story,
and I'll weave some excerpts

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:47.980
from them into my talk today.

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:52.420
So turning to the beginning of
my story, what was Kazakhstan

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:58.090 position:56%
as a place and society like, and how
did these conditions lead to famine?

00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:00.660
So when it was created,
the Soviet Republic

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:03.710
of Kazakhstan -- it
was created in 1924.

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:05.870
It was a really immense territory.

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:09.130
All of these parts had been
under Russian Imperial rule,

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:12.900
but they'd never before been
ruled as a unified whole.

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.480
It bordered several
other Soviet republics,

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:20.540
and it also had a large border with
China, as you can see from the map.

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:22.070
It was enormous.

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:25.480
It was approximately -- Kazakhstan
was approximately, and still is,

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:29.080
the size of continental Europe,
or to use another measurement,

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:33.060
four times the size
of the state of Texas.

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:34.930
It had a sharp continental climate,

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:37.410
with hot summers and
very cold winters.

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:41.310
It was very arid and
also prone to drought.

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:45.090
As you can see from the
map, the yellow areas are

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:48.690
where the steppe is classified
as desert or semi-desert.

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:51.130
So that's really much
of the republic.

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:54.820
And there's more fertile zones in
the north and in the southeast.

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:58.430
The climate in what --
in the central area,

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:01.890
which is nicknamed the Hungry
Steppe, and where I take the title

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:04.670
of my talk, is a vast plateau,

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:08.320
and the climate there was
particularly prone to drought.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:12.630
Not only was the amount of
rainfall low, but rainfall patterns

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:14.540
in the Kazakh Steppe
were more unstable

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:16.610
than in the steppes
in European Russia.

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:20.420
There was a great deal of
volatility from year to year.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:24.870
And a good rainfall year could be
followed by a poor rainfall year.

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:29.090
Kazakhs' practice of pastoral
nomadism was an adaptation

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:31.850
to these feature, the
distinctive features of the steppe,

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:34.450
particularly the lack of
good pasture land and water.

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:38.980
As pastoral nomads -- and you --
I'll show you some examples --

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:42.580
they carried out seasonal
migrations along predefined routes

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:44.390
to pasture their animal herds.

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:46.860
And here you get a sense --
and in these other photos --

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:50.390
you get a sense of the
isolation of the landscape,

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:53.290
how important animals are
to their everyday existence.

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:55.910
You can see the yurts,
the mobile dwellings

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:59.000
which are actually made
out of animal products.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.560
These migratory encampments
are referred to --

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:05.460
a migratory encampment is referred
to as an aul [assumed spelling],

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:10.950
and another example of
nomadic life from this period.

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:12.860
But pastoral nomadism,
as I'll stress,

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:15.000
is not just an economic strategy,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.670
a way of using the
steppe's scarce resources,

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:21.120
it's also a crucial
source of identity.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:24.150
Historically when a
Kazakh sedentarized

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:28.240
and abandoned nomadic life, he
was no longer seen as Kazakh.

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:32.060
In the late 19th century
the Kazakh steppe comes

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:37.290
under Russian imperial rule, over
a million settlers from Russia --

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:39.860
European Russia settled
the Kazakh steppe.

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:43.120
They settled more fertile
regions, particularly in the north.

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:47.500
Their arrival makes the Kazakh
steppe into a multi-ethnic society,

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:50.420
but it also provokes important
changes in nomadic life,

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:53.120
changes to Kazakh's diet and
to their migration routes.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:56.900
I explore these changes in
greater detail in my book,

00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:00.440
showing how the legacies of Russian
imperial rule became a contributing

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:03.080
factor, actually, in
the famine itself.

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:08.030
By the onset of Soviet rule,
Kazakhs are the largest group

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:09.660
of nomads in the Soviet Union.

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:12.780
They constitute about
80% of the total.

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:14.970
And for the vast majority
of Kazakhs,

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:19.370
being Kazakh is still very closely
intertwined with being a nomad.

00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:23.210
The term Kazakh we might think of
actually as a type of mixed social

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:27.530
and ethnic category, one which
denotes a way of life, but also --

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:31.490
pastoral nomadism,
but also an ethnicity.

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:36.630
In the initial years of Soviet
rule, the period '21 to 1928,

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:40.370
Moscow took a contradictory
approach to ruling the republic.

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:44.530
Some programs worked to undermine
pastoralism while other programs

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:47.600
actually worked to support it.

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:51.380
In general, Party experts and
bureaucrats really struggled

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:54.500
to understand what
approach they should take.

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.760
This was a landscape
and a population

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.810
that did not have clear
parallels in the categories

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:03.810
that Party members brought
with them from European Russia.

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:05.110
Karl Marx, for instance,

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:07.910
had predicted that socialist
revolutions might occur

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:09.660
among workers.

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:13.810
Lenin then radically modifies
Marx's ideas, and he predicts

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:18.110
that a socialist-style revolution
might occur amongst peasants.

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:21.780
But neither of the two men
had given much thought to how

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:25.760
and if a socialist-style revolution
might occur amongst an entirely

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.810
different social group,
pastoral nomads.

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:32.880
Party experts began to
ponder a series of questions.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.800
Did nomads actually have
classes in the same way

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.140
that settled societies did?

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:40.370
And if so, how did
these classes function?

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:43.140
Economically could
pastoral nomads speed

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:45.700
through the Marxist/Leninist
timeline of history

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:49.260
and be transformed into
productive factory workers?

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:54.000
Indeed, the seeming absurdity of
bringing socialist-style revolution

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.570
to this republic dotted with nomads
led one prominent Kazakh cadre,

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:02.700
Sultanbek Khodzhanov -- you can see
him here -- to circulate a joke,

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.410
"You can't get to socialism
by camel."

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:11.410
[Laughter] At the heart of
Khodzhanov's joke was a question

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:14.920
which Party experts themselves
tried to resolve in this period,

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:17.250 position:56%
could you get to socialism by camel?

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:19.110
I.e., was nomadism backward?

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:21.570
Or was it, in fact,
a modern way of life,

00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:24.070 position:56%
something compatible with socialism?

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:27.900
Entangled, of course, with all of
these questions was the question

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.910
of the issue of the
republic's environment.

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:34.710
Could a specifically socialist
state overcome the difficulties

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:38.220
that Kazakhstan's arid
landscape, which was so different

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:41.520
from Western Europe, seem
to place on human activity?

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:45.370
Or rather, was nomadism the only
possible use of the landscape

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:48.230
in particularly arid
areas of the republic?

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:50.430
Indeed, many Party
experts associated

00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:53.540
with the republic's Commissariat
of Agriculture concurred

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:57.320 position:56%
that nomadism was the most
productive use of the Kazakh steppe.

00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:00.280
One ethnographer and Party expert,
Sergey Shvetzov [assumed spelling],

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.610
went so far as to warn

00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:04.610
of the extreme dangers
of nomadic settlement.

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:07.350
Shvetzov, who had been
allied with the right faction

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:10.870
of the Socialist Revolutionary
Party said, quote, "The destruction

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:12.170
of the nomadic way of life

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:14.700
in Kazakhstan would
represent not only the death

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:17.890
of steppe livestock raising
and the Kazakh economy,

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:19.970
but the transformation
of the dry steppe

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:22.740
into an unpopulated
desert," unquote.

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:26.600
But by 1928, the tenor of these
discussions in Kazakhstan,

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:30.160
and across the Soviet Union
more generally, began to shift.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:32.110
A severe shortage of grain

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:35.150
across the Soviet Union
triggers a shift in policy.

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:38.120
This leads Stalin to introduce
the first five-year plan,

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:42.170
this radical modernization scheme
that I mentioned at the outset.

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:45.140
Experts such as Shvetzov
became vulnerable both

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:49.240 position:56%
for their non-Bolshevik background,
as I mentioned, and for their ideas.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.830
And he is denounced.

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:54.640
A separate group of experts
now belittled the assertion

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.680
that the Kazakh steppe's
environment places certain limits

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:59.100
on human activity.

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:02.140
They argue that under socialism
swamps might be desert --

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:04.880
might emptied, entire
desert irrigated,

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:08.500
and even the lowest-quality
soil brought under cultivation.

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:11.250
Settled life rather than
pastoralism, they argue,

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:13.820
is the most productive
use of the landscape.

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:18.420 position:56%
They argue that settling the Kazakhs
is going to lead I dramatic gains

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:21.450
in the republic's productivity,
freeing up resources

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:24.340
such as land, labor, and livestock.

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:27.460
The language of Soviet
nationalities policy which sought

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:29.490
to consolidate groups
such as the Kazakhs

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:32.950
into modern socialist nations
served to further legitimize

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:36.520
and reinforce the importance
of the shift to settled life.

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.660
Experts declared nomadism to be
incompatible with the development

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:43.480
of so-called contemporary culture
such as schools, hospitals,

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:44.990
and telegraph connections.

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:48.990
Leading Party member declared
that Kazakhs national development,

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:52.270 position:56%
what they euphemistically referred
to as the reconstruction of the aul,

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:54.940
or nomadic encampment,
is not in opposition

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:58.140 position:56%
to the republic's economic
development but, as they phrased it,

00:21:58.140 --> 00:21:59.440
one flows from the other.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.870
Thus the language of Soviet
nationalities, policies serves

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:07.010
to reinforce the Party's war
on a social category, nomad.

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:10.640
As we will see, the category
of Kazakh and the category

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:14.280
of nomad served overlapping
and usually reinforcing goals

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:16.970
for the Party's assault
on nomadic life.

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:25.160
In 1928 the Party's war on nomadic
life began, and it would escalate

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:29.860
by the winter of 1929 to
1930 with collectivization.

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:33.410 position:56%
This assault was led by Kazakhstan's
leader and Party secretary,

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:37.830
a man named Filipp Goloshchekin.

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:40.320
Goloshchekin himself
is actually someone

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:43.900
who had originally been trained
as a dentist but then picked

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:46.570
up another career,
making a revolution.

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:51.850
He joins the Bolsheviks
early, prior to 1917.

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:57.140
He goes on to gain fame for his
revolutionary zeal and toughness.

00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:59.690
And he's actually renowned
in Bolshevik circles.

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:02.840
He plays a role in the
murder of the czar's family.

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:06.450
Later on in 1933 -- it's getting
a little bit ahead of the story,

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:08.310 position:56%
but he is removed from his position.

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:09.610
He's actually scapegoated

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:12.670
with causing the Kazakh
famine at the time.

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:15.300
Famine today in Kazakhstan
is often still referred

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.710
to as Goloshchekin's genocide.

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:20.620
As you can see and you might
guess from his death dates,

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:25.920
he's actually executed like many
others who had old Bolshevik ties

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:29.540
in '41 as part of the
Party purchase.

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:35.060
With the launch of collectivization
in 1929, Moscow declares the onset

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:37.690
of a program entitled
sedentarization on the basis

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:39.290
of full collectivization.

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:41.480
This meant that nomads
are going to be sped

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:44.440
through the Marxist/Leninist
timeline of history,

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:48.720
that they would be sedentarized and
also collectivized simultaneously.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:52.370
It was underpinned by the idea
that you needed extraordinary speed

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:57.030 position:56%
to help [inaudible] help the Kazakhs
catch up to more advanced peoples.

00:23:57.030 --> 00:23:59.790
So I'm sure you have never seen
a photograph of a camel hooked

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:03.450
up to a plow before,
but there you go.

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:07.480 position:56%
Like depeasantization, its corollary
in the Soviet Union's West,

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:10.450
nomadic settlement was an attack
on the culture, and identities,

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:13.690
and economic practices of
this particular social group.

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:17.110
Activists began to
collectivize nomadic regions.

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:20.100
They led the dizzying grain
and meat procurements.

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:22.700
At times they used the
republic's environment

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:25.440
to exact maximum damage, actually.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:28.630
They settled Kazakhs in areas of
the republic that had no water

00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:31.720
or were particularly
susceptible to drought.

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:35.880 position:56%
The republic's Party Committee
begins to pursue also denomadization

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:39.130
through other routes, criminalizing
a range of practices essential

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:42.500
to the maintenance of nomadic
life such as Kazakh's slaughter

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:45.800
of animals during the
wintertime or their ability

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.440
to migrate across seasonal borders.

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.950
Efforts at local-level
implementation hinge heavily

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:58.010
on Moscow's partnership with local
cadres, many of whom are Kazakh.

00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:00.630
And as I discuss in
greater detail in my book,

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:04.020
the promotion of native cadres
actually forms a crucial element

00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:06.170
of this nation-building policy.

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:09.980 position:56%
The upper ranks of the Party and
state bureaucracy are largely filled

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:12.690
with bureaucrats from
European Russia,

00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:14.330
some of them like Goloshchekin.

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:18.400
But the lower ranks of the
bureaucracy are primarily Kazakh.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:22.540
And in a strategy purposely
designed to shatter old allegiances

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:26.910 position:56%
and settle violent conflict, Moscow
actually empowers Kazakhs themselves

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:29.740
to make some of the most crucial
choices such as, you know,

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:31.670 position:56%
who would be considered an exploiter

00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:34.380
and how much grain to
confiscate from them.

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:35.700
And as I found in my research,

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:39.180
the efforts of these local
cadres were actually crucial.

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:42.980
They often shaped the scale of
the violence, its intensity,

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:45.860
but also its character,
including which groups won

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:48.720
out and which groups lost.

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.850
Ultimately, the result
of this assault,

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:52.970
this campaign of denomadization,

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:55.170
were both anticipated
and unanticipated.

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:58.680
In the winter of 1930 famine began.

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:02.520
In Kazakhstan, like in other
places, Moscow anticipated

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:06.520
that this offensive would result
in considerable loss of life.

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:10.490
And this was seen as a necessary
byproduct of this effort

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:12.410
to incorporate the region.

00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:15.010
But Moscow did not anticipate
the scale of the famine,

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:18.750
and a number of unintended
consequences soon emerged.

00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:21.850
Animal numbers began to plummet
rapidly as the Party struggled

00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:24.080
to develop a form of
animal husbandry

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.680
to take pastoral nomadism's place.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.730
Animals that are socialized in
large pens for the first time,

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:33.180
they begin to contract various
diseases, and they parish.

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:35.410
Muhammed Shaek Mietov [assumed
spelling], a famine survivor,

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:39.600
recalled, quote, "An eerie
silence hung over the aul.

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.760
There was no mooing,
bleating, or neighing."

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:46.420
As the situation inside Kazakhstan
became increasingly desperate,

00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:48.580
many nomads entered into flight.

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:51.330
This was a strategy
that nomads often used

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:54.560
when political conditions
became difficult

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:57.520
or when environmental
conditions changed.

00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:01.090
And they use it again
now during the famine.

00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:02.680
With their herd numbers in ruins,

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:06.840
those who remained behind
faced an almost certain death.

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:08.610
Zayten Akuchv [assumed
spelling] who works as a --

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:11.920
who worked as a teacher on the
outskirts of Semipalatinsk,

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:14.000
a city in the republic's north,

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.220 position:56%
remembered touring abandoned
settlements on the city's outskirts.

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:23.320
Most were empty, but in one hut he
found two skeletons intertwined,

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:26.590
two lovers trapped in an embrace.

00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:30.170
The republic itself in this
period begins to empty out.

00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:32.310
Ultimately more than 20%

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:36.060
of the republic's population
would actually flee Kazakhstan.

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:37.660
That's over a million people.

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:42.400
This created a regional crisis
of unprecedented proportions.

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:46.540
And here you can see some
people fleeing the famine.

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:50.160
I -- my guess is actually
they're first-wave refugees.

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:53.270 position:56%
You can see they're actually dressed
a little bit better than most

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:57.750
of the descriptions of the refugees
I encounter in my documents.

00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:00.260
Moscow framed this
tremendous human suffering

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:03.290
as a sign of success and progress.

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:07.870
Kazakh refugees were referred to
as otkochevniki [assumed spelling],

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:10.820
and literally that term means
-- this is an invented term --

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:12.920 position:56%
it means nomads who are moving away.

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:15.900
And their appearance was
actually depicted as part

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:17.690
of a necessary transition

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:20.800
in Kazakh's development
into a socialist nation.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:24.920
This transitional stage demanded
extra vigilance, officials warned,

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:28.040
and the Party intensified
its assault on nomadism,

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.630
declaring fantastical plans

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:33.510
to settle the Kazakhs even
more quickly than before.

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:36.670
In neighboring Soviet republics,
where starving Kazakhs fled,

00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:39.400
the tensions between Soviet
nationalities, policy,

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:42.820
and Soviet economic policy
come into sharp relief.

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:45.250
Waves of violence broke
out as locals seek

00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:48.480
to expel so-called foreign
Kazakhs from their republics,

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:49.980
such as Uzbekistan and Russia.

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:53.160
And this was particularly
striking given that the division

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:56.060
of these republics into national
territories had been imposed

00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:59.750
by Moscow on this region
just a few years before.

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:03.540
Kazakhs in neighboring republics
were often lynched or beaten.

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:07.050
In Russia, activists round
up Kazakhs in railcars

00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:10.940 position:56%
and send them back to Kazakhstan,
dumping them just across the border.

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:14.400
As the crisis inside
the republic deepened,

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:17.780 position:56%
Moscow tried to institute
proposals to settle Kazakhs actually

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:20.400
where the fled in these
neighboring republics.

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:23.460
But officials in these
republics harnessed the language

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:25.430
of nationality to object.

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:27.990
They protested that
proposals to settle Kazakhs

00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:30.450
where the fled represented
a violation

00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:34.390
of their republic's
so-called national rights.

00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:39.460
Inside the republic a desperate
struggle for survival continued.

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:42.660
Muhammed Shaek Mietov, the
famine survivor, remembered,

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:46.150
"Everyone was now preoccupied
by getting something to eat

00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:49.340
for the following day, or that
same day, or that very moment

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:51.300
to relieve their hunger pangs.

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:53.650
Even the kindest-hearted
people, and closest friends,

00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:57.080
and relatives could no
longer help one another out."

00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:00.750
Along the republic's railway
lines travelers encountered scene

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:02.050
of horror.

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:05.490
They reported seeing living
skeletons with tiny child skeletons

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:07.730
in their hands, begging for food.

00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:10.680
Many peoples turned to
substitute foods to survive.

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:13.840
Famine survivors remember
eating wild grasses or combing

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:17.550
through fields to collect the
rotting remains of the harvest.

00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:19.800
Others turned to cannibalism.

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:23.580
One of the most pressing problems
became the burial of the dead.

00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:26.610
When activists had the strength
to do it, corpses are dumped

00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:28.610
on the outskirts of cities.

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:31.950
And for those who survived the
famine, seeing loved ones buried

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:34.500 position:56%
in this famine was deeply traumatic.

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:37.380
These mass burials
violated Muslim tradition,

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:40.400
which caused for the faces of
the dead to be wrapped in cloth

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:44.470
and their bodies turned
toward Mecca before burial.

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:48.180
Remembering the desperation of
the final -- famine's final phase,

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:51.330
Tussen Asabaev [assumed spelling],
a famine survivor, wrote,

00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:53.320
"Suffering was not
leaving our heads.

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:56.590
Our eyes were full of tears."

00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:58.410
Ultimately Moscow would
finally succeed

00:30:58.410 --> 00:31:02.020
in bringing the famine
to an end in 1934.

00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:06.230
Due to the death of more than 90%
of the republic's livestock herds,

00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:08.700
pastoral nomadism as a
way of life had all --

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:10.860
been all but extinguished.

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.060
Moscow had succeeded in doing this,

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:16.910
and this would trigger a profound
transformation of Kazakh identity.

00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:20.780 position:56%
More than a million and a half
people had perished, as I mentioned.

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:23.210
Though Kazakhstan was
a multi-ethnic society,

00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:26.590
the burden of the suffering fell
disproportionately on Kazakhs.

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:29.470
And they constituted
actually 1.3 million

00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:32.680
of this death toll of 1.5 million.

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:36.060 position:56%
It's clear that the regime's broader
goal was to transform Kazakhs

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:40.630 position:56%
and Kazakhstan radically with little
regard for the tremendous loss

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:42.730
of life incurred in the process.

00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:44.440
Moscow's policies, for instance,

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:48.230
anticipate the cultural
destruction of Kazakh societies.

00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:51.100
But I cannot find any evidence
to indicate that these plans

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:54.890
for a violent transformation of
Kazakhstan ever became transformed

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:58.820
into a desire to eliminate
Kazakhs as a group.

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:02.330
But it's clear also that the regime
could not transform Kazakh society

00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:03.640
as it wished.

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:06.500
Some features of Kazakhs'
pastoral nomadic way of life,

00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:09.990
such as their reliance on kinship,
actually survived the famine.

00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:13.470
Though the Party had sought
to consolidate Kazakh society

00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:18.020
into a nation defined by territory,
as I mentioned, large numbers --

00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:20.430
over a million Kazakhs
are displaced outside

00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:22.550
of the republic during the famine.

00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:27.220
Many of them never
returned to Kazakhstan,

00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:30.750
and this profoundly
reshapes the demographic

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:34.460
and the ethnic balance
of the broader region.

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:37.010
And while the regime
actually sought to carry

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:38.740
out Soviet-style modernization,

00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:41.780
they had actually engineered
the republic's total collapse --

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:43.290
economic collapse.

00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:45.630
Though the republic had
previously been Moscow

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:47.780 position:56%
and Leningrad's major meat supplier,

00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:50.320
some 90% of the republic's
animal herds,

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:52.780
as I mentioned, perish
in this disaster.

00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:55.260
It would take more than
two decades for them

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:57.120
to bring the republic's
livestock numbers

00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:59.450
to reach their pre-famine levels.

00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:01.920
Due to the lack of work
animals in the republic

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:05.460
in the disaster's aftermath,
collective farmers now sewed --

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:08.650
were forced actually to
sew the fields by hand.

00:33:08.650 --> 00:33:11.850
Officials are even forced to
purchase livestock from China

00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:15.350
to build up the republic's
livestock base.

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:18.910
To conclude my talk, I'd like
to return to the questions

00:33:18.910 --> 00:33:21.480
of Soviet modernization
and nation-building,

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:24.700
two issues that I raised
at the beginning.

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:27.310
On the subject of Soviet
modernization we see

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:30.860
that the challenges of transforming
this region were distinct.

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:32.480
And I've called -- along the way

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:35.890
in my talk I've called
particular attention to the issues

00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:39.660
that they faced in transforming
the republic's arid environment,

00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:43.660
which differed sharply from the
landscapes of European Russia.

00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:47.100 position:56%
Ultimately the issue of
transforming the landscape continues

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:50.190
to bedevil the regime, and we can
see echoes of it, for instance,

00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:52.610
in later periods, such
as the attempt

00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:54.550
to transform the Kazakh steppe

00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:59.310
under the virgin lands
program through Khrushchev.

00:33:59.310 --> 00:34:02.350
But on the subject of
Soviet development,

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:05.010
I've also stressed the
extent to which the project

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:08.690
of collectivization in
Kazakhstan was a failure.

00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:11.490
These policies were cruel, but
they were also counterproductive.

00:34:11.490 --> 00:34:15.000
They were repressive, but
they were also self-defeating.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.100
Soviet modernization was supposed
to build a stronger state,

00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:21.420
but in reality it would take the
republic several decades to recover

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:23.780
from this economic devastation.

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:27.400
As I've shown, the language of
Soviet nation-building often served

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:30.660
to reinforce rather than
contradict the regime's goals

00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:33.440
of Soviet economic transformation.

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:37.680
Categories such as Kazakh and nomad
were not necessarily in opposition

00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:41.900
to each other, but they might
serve mutually-reinforcing goals.

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:45.280
This helps us shed new light on how
to understand the devastating toll

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:47.770
of the Soviet collectivization
famines,

00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:50.520
which as I previously
mentioned, took --

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:55.570
hit a broad swath of the Soviet
Union, but in particular Ukraine,

00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:58.330 position:56%
and the Volga, Don, and Kuban areas.

00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:01.910
Previously much of the
scholarship on collectivization

00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:03.900
and these famines has
been highly contested,

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:06.250
and it's been divided
into two schools.

00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:10.080
And the case of the Kazakh
famine has been largely left out.

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:13.790
The first school raises
the issue of nationality.

00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:17.300
They argue that this is the
moment in collectivization

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.670
when the regime abandoned its
commitment to the promotion

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:23.090
of nationality and carried
out an orchestrated attack

00:35:23.090 --> 00:35:26.570
against Ukrainians
as a national group.

00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:29.590
Alternately, others have
taken a different view.

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:33.580 position:56%
They've argued that the Ukrainian
famine was part of a broader assault

00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:37.500
by the regime against a
social category, peasants.

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:40.080
In Ukraine, like in
Kazakhstan, a national

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:42.080
and a social category
actually overlap.

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:44.050
Most Ukrainians are peasants.

00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:46.980
And to bolster their claims, these
scholars point to the existence

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:50.710
of famine amongst the peasantry in
other parts of the Soviet Union,

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:54.080
such as the Don, Kuban,
and Volga areas of Russia.

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:58.180
But my research shows -- and more
broadly, I think the reassertion

00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:00.270
of the Kazakh famine
into this debate --

00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:04.260
that neither the explanation of
nationality or peasantry holds.

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:06.580
As the case of the Kazakh famine

00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:09.980
and the Party's denomadization
campaign reveals,

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:12.440
collectivization was
an assault actually

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:17.090
on social categories more broadly,
not just an assault on peasants.

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:19.990
The categories of national and
social were not necessarily

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:22.930
in opposition to each other
or mutually exclusive,

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:26.410
as this debate might imply,
but they often served mutually

00:36:26.410 --> 00:36:28.440
reinforcing aims.

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:30.900
While many scholars imply
that the regime's treatment

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:32.720
of Ukrainians was unique,

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:35.050
my work shows that there
was a far broader swath

00:36:35.050 --> 00:36:36.810
of terror in this period.

00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:40.340
Many of the brutal tactics used
in Ukraine, such as the closure

00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:43.060
of borders so that the starving
peasants could not flee,

00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:46.620
were actually used
first in Kazakhstan.

00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:50.250
Ultimately my research reveals
the centrality of the project

00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:53.330
of nation-building to
the Soviet project.

00:36:53.330 --> 00:36:55.610
In Kazakhstan we most
clearly see, I think,

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:57.360
the Soviets' mobilizational aims.

00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.720
The extraordinary efforts
that they took

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:02.620
to form a group of
nomads into a nation.

00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:06.170
But the unresolved tensions between
the project of Soviet modernity

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:09.610
and Soviet nation-making were
unresolved, and they would continue

00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:12.830
to plague the Soviet Union
up through the collapse.

[ Inaudible ]

00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:36.880
&gt;&gt; Sarah Cameron: I think the
whole question of the memory

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:39.180
of the Kazakh famine, it's a
really, really interesting topic,

00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:41.590
and whenever I speak, I
encourage someone else to go out

00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:45.050
and write a book on
it, because it's an --

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:48.430
I make some stabs at trying
to say something about it,

00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:52.320 position:56%
but it's actually a really important
and a very interesting topic.

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:57.480
So yes, as far as I've been able
to determine, the -- it is --

00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:00.210
memories of the famine
are preserved orally.

00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:02.090
It also -- you know, during --

00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:05.610
for the '30s through up until the
collapse, you couldn't really talk

00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:09.280
about this subject, but I found
actually examples of that woven,

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.060
for instance, into
Kazakh literature.

00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:12.490
That's one way that it appears,

00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:16.080
in Kazakh-language literary
journals in this period.

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:19.790
But I haven't -- I
haven't done the research

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:22.320
or found much evidence beyond that.

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:24.730
That is sort of my only
instance of it appearing

00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:26.320
from the '30s to the '90s.

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:31.430
In the 1990s what is quite
interesting -- and here the --

00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:32.730
for instance, the memory

00:39:32.730 --> 00:39:35.210
of the Kazakh famine has taken
a completely different track

00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:39.150 position:56%
than say the memory of the Ukrainian
famine, which has really kind

00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:43.440
of assumed a central role in the
making of Ukrainian identity.

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:47.600
So in the early 1990s
the Kazakh famine is,

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:49.150
quote, unquote, discovered.

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:54.290
And it is talked about all over
scholarly and popular media.

00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:57.440
There is an -- it's actually
even ruled a genocide

00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:59.460
by people in Kazakhstan.

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:03.700
There's a government
commission that looks into it.

00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:06.230
And often some of that literature

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:09.020
at the time also takes
a kind of nastier edge.

00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:12.270
Goloshchekin, who I highlighted
in my talk, is Jewish.

00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:15.260
This is repeated again and again
as Goloshchekin's genocide in some

00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:18.010
of the -- there are some
very good scholarly accounts,

00:40:18.010 --> 00:40:20.950
but some others take a
kind of either implicitly

00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:24.500
or explicitly anti-Semitic tone.

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:28.490
Then the other interesting thing
is that after this explosion

00:40:28.490 --> 00:40:31.080
of interest in it, the
topic begins to die down.

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:33.960
And that has more or less,
with some exceptions,

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:37.640
remained the state up until today.

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:39.350
Even when I was researching this

00:40:39.350 --> 00:40:42.090
in Kazakhstan I had a couple
of people come up to me.

00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:43.390
They said, "Great.

00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:44.830 position:56%
It's great you're telling that story

00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:49.100
to an American audience,
but we've solved that."

00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:52.040
And I was really struck by this.

00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:56.210 position:56%
And I couldn't -- you know, I began
to probe further, and I talked to --

00:40:56.210 --> 00:41:00.260
you know, I talked to some
Kazakh scholars about it.

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:03.600
And I think there's probably
a couple explanations for it.

00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:07.650
One is, of course, Kazakhstan's
close relationship with Russia.

00:41:07.650 --> 00:41:10.670
There is a fear by
bringing up this topic

00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:14.260
that they might hurt their
relationship with Russia

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:17.170
or hurt the relationship

00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:20.410
with Kazakhstan's large
ethnic Russian population.

00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:25.580 position:56%
Another explanation for the topic,
I think, is -- you know, I've had --

00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:28.470
talked with some Kazakh
scholars who have said,

00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:31.530
"Look, we were nomads before.

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:34.010
Now we are a modern society."

00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:38.180
And so I think in Kazakhstan what
you see to a certain extent is kind

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:43.570
of a greater ambivalence about what
Soviet modernization actually meant

00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:46.090
and what it brought to Kazakhstan.

00:41:46.090 --> 00:41:48.990
But it's very complicated.

00:41:48.990 --> 00:41:51.670
It's a complicated
issue, and someone needs

00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:54.140
to write a book on it, I would say.

00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:55.440
Yes?

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:58.270
&gt;&gt; So this isn't -- I mean,
possibly this is also,

00:41:58.270 --> 00:42:01.940
but not entirely a
question of memory,

00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:03.840
that [inaudible] should
be [inaudible]

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:07.000
but you talked about the fact

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:12.110
that the lower-level bureaucrats
[inaudible] to be ethnically --

00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:13.500
&gt;&gt; Sarah Cameron: Yeah, yeah.

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:14.990
&gt;&gt; How are they thought of --

00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:21.060
well, part of [inaudible]
is in the Warsaw Ghettos,

00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:26.510
some of the different
ghettos where you have Jewish

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:34.900 position:56%
committees [inaudible] in the ghetto
and [inaudible] people communicating

00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:38.450
where they didn't have
the same regime.

00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:39.750
[Inaudible] question, right?

00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:41.160
Who [inaudible] protecting
the population?

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:44.860
And how bad is --

00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:46.760
&gt;&gt; Sarah Cameron: Not
very much, I would say.

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:51.420
I think that is also -- you know,
like any difficult topic and,

00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:53.900
you know, returning to your
question, too, I think that's --

00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:56.770
I mean, famines are
complicated, right?

00:42:56.770 --> 00:42:59.340
The notion -- the whole
notion of kind of a victim

00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:02.560 position:56%
or a perpetrator is really difficult
when you're talking about a famine

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:05.950
and talking about survival
in this period.

00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:10.060 position:56%
So there is a certain willingness to
-- there were some Kazakhs who were

00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:12.840
in the upper levels of the
bureaucracy, much less, though,

00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:14.140
than there is from European Russia.

00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:17.790 position:56%
And there was a certain
willingness to say, "Look, you know,

00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:21.760
these guys didn't do a good thing."

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:25.090
So some of them have sort of
been identified and talked about.

00:43:25.090 --> 00:43:27.420
But on the lower level,
I think that's --

00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:29.950
that is still not very
much recognized

00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:32.900
or -- you know, or discussed.

00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:36.180
I mean, another point that
that -- your questions, too,

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:39.340
bring up is that Kazakhstan,
to this day there's sort of --

00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:43.430
it's a big country territorially,
but it's also a small country

00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:46.550
in that networks and circles
are often inter-tangled.

00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:48.210
And I've heard things
said like, "Oh,

00:43:48.210 --> 00:43:50.800
I was reading an archival document,

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:53.660
and I saw that that guy did
something bad to someone else --

00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:56.810
that Kazakh did something bad
to someone else, but you know,

00:43:56.810 --> 00:43:58.240
I know his uncle, so you know,

00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:00.550
I don't think I'm going
to write about that.

00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:02.750
So I think that -- the sort of --

00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:08.120
the tininess of sort of the
elite may also play a role

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:09.420
into this as well

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:13.330
&gt;&gt; Is there a sense
in which there is sort

00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:15.490
of people who had somewhere --

00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:16.790
&gt;&gt; Sarah Cameron: Yeah.

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:20.610
&gt;&gt; Are they able to shield their
most immediate kinship networks

00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:24.990
from the effects of
dislocation and --

00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:26.290
&gt;&gt; Sarah Cameron: Yeah,
some of them are.

00:44:26.290 --> 00:44:27.780
So I definitely see
this in the documents,

00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:30.940
and this is an interesting
-- because the Party itself,

00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:32.970
for instance, one of the
goals of this campaign

00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:36.570
against nomadism is they wanted to
eliminate markers such as kinship.

00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:41.530 position:56%
But in actuality we -- I certainly
on the ground see it playing a role,

00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:46.500
that people alternately they
tried to, you know, shield --

00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:49.770
for instance, shield some kin
members from confiscation,

00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:52.570
use it to punish members
of a rival clan.

00:44:52.570 --> 00:44:54.830
But you also see some
instances, too,

00:44:54.830 --> 00:44:57.700
of maybe what I would argue
even is belief, right,

00:44:57.700 --> 00:45:01.580
that belief in the project
that they were doing.

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:04.490
Yes, Colleen?

00:45:04.490 --> 00:45:07.620
&gt;&gt; Thanks for such
an interesting talk.

00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:09.920
I was wondering about these
low-level Kazakh bureaucrats.

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:14.850
Were they educated in
Moscow, or were they --

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.880
&gt;&gt; Sarah Cameron: Very few of them
-- so at least on the local level,

00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:22.020
most of these -- most of
the Kazakhs probably --

00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:24.650
maybe they have some kind
of Islamic education,

00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:26.370
but most of them are not literate.

00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:29.170
And that's the problem that
I was sort of referring

00:45:29.170 --> 00:45:30.470
to in the beginning with sources.

00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:34.800
But on the higher level,
most of those who are serving

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:37.730
in the higher levels of the
Party, they speak Russian.

00:45:37.730 --> 00:45:40.400
And if -- only a very,
very few of them --

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:43.000
I can actually only think of
one of the top of my head,

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.720
Rashan Dosev [assumed spelling],
who's educated in Moscow.

00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:47.100
The rest of them either --

00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:51.150
a few have a traditional
confessional education,

00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:56.790
but some of them are educated in
so-called Russo-native schools,

00:45:56.790 --> 00:46:02.570 position:56%
which were set up by the Russian
Empire in the 19th century, so yeah.

00:46:02.570 --> 00:46:03.870
Yes?

00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:06.570
&gt;&gt; Hi, so thank you so much for
this really interesting talk.

00:46:06.570 --> 00:46:11.580
I wanted to ask you about your
comments [inaudible] comparison

00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:12.880
to --

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:14.180
&gt;&gt; Sarah Cameron: Yeah.

00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:15.480
&gt;&gt; And it's --

00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:16.780
&gt;&gt; Sarah Cameron: I was wondering
why I hadn't gotten a question

00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:18.080
about the Ukrainian famine yet.

00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:19.380
It's always -- usually it's like
the second or third question.

00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:23.970
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] I was thinking when
you were describing that as the --

00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:29.950
sort of the [inaudible] of the
empires and colonial [inaudible]

00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:32.950
where frontiers and colonies
serves as kind of laboratories

00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:37.760 position:56%
for population control, or forms of
[inaudible] violence, or other kinds

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:40.110
of [inaudible] of ways
that [inaudible]

00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:46.420
regimes ended up refining
their mechanisms of form

00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:48.100 position:56%
and [inaudible] and lasting effects.

00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:50.770
Or if you're taking -- if
you were looking at some

00:46:50.770 --> 00:46:55.090
of the lasting effects
of the experiments

00:46:55.090 --> 00:46:57.380
in Kazakhstan [inaudible]
Soviet Union's operations --

00:46:57.380 --> 00:46:59.230
&gt;&gt; Sarah Cameron: This is
a very tricky question.

00:46:59.230 --> 00:47:00.530
It's a very good one.

00:47:00.530 --> 00:47:04.570
I've had a lot of -- I can
point to some hints, but I'm --

00:47:04.570 --> 00:47:08.090
I think one of the
difficulties also is

00:47:08.090 --> 00:47:10.860
in tracing the transmission
techniques, right?

00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:14.880
One of the interesting things,
for instance, is that if we look

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:17.180
at the Ukrainian famine,
a lot of scholars

00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:19.750
of the Ukrainian famine
have argued that a lot

00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:23.080
of these very brutal techniques,
you know, such as the closure

00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:26.500
of borders, the blacklisting of
villages, and so on, in Ukraine,

00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:28.800
that these were unique to
Ukraine, and they were introduced

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:32.360
at a certain moment in
the fall of 1932 to '33.

00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:34.730
However, the Kazakh
famine begins earlier.

00:47:34.730 --> 00:47:38.080
A lot of these techniques are
introduced in Kazakhstan first.

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:41.700
So I cannot -- you know, it's hard.

00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:44.520
I've not been able to
trace the transmission,

00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:46.230
you know, through Moscow.

00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:49.040
But that itself I think
is interesting to see

00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:53.820
that there is a broader
kind of spectrum of terror.

00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:58.260
I mean, I think more
broadly maybe there's also --

00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:02.490
you might trace it a little it
in terms of personnel as well.

00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:06.210
So in the early 1920s -- actually

00:48:06.210 --> 00:48:08.910
when Goloshchekin first
comes along the [inaudible],

00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:10.930
he is sent to Kazakhstan.

00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:13.010
But one of the people who's
in Kazakhstan with him

00:48:13.010 --> 00:48:17.790
who is posted there is Yezhov
who becomes very famous.

00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:21.330
Yezhov, sort of his nickname
later becomes the Bloody Dwarf.

00:48:21.330 --> 00:48:25.450
He's the person that --
basically the main architect

00:48:25.450 --> 00:48:26.860
of the Great Terror.

00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:30.800
And he spends some of his
formative years in Kazakhstan.

00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:34.840
So I think that's another kind
of interesting example of that.

00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:36.250
Yes?

00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:40.660
&gt;&gt; The thing that strikes
me as a reason possibly

00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:46.080
that the famine has not be treated
to the extensive [inaudible]

00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:50.390
in recent years is not only
the [inaudible] about Russia,

00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:54.040
but the fact that if you
[inaudible] there were a

00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:59.730
lot of Kazakhs who were connected

00:48:59.730 --> 00:49:03.780
with [inaudible] Kazakhstan
seems to have been [inaudible]

00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:08.800
disproportionately affected
in the purges of '36 to '38.

00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:14.960
I remember going through
the museums in [inaudible],

00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:18.120
and they had pictures of all the

00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:25.170
great [inaudible] every single
one of them [inaudible] 1938.

00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:32.490
Is that 1938 [inaudible] somehow
heightened power [inaudible]

00:49:32.490 --> 00:49:42.100
Kazakhstan became the dumping
ground for all of the --

00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:43.580
&gt;&gt; Sarah Cameron: Yeah, yeah.

00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:48.330 position:56%
&gt;&gt; -- which is [inaudible] it's
another thing that's multi-ethnic --

00:49:48.330 --> 00:49:49.630
&gt;&gt; Sarah Cameron: Of course, yeah.

00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:50.930
&gt;&gt; It's [inaudible].

00:49:50.930 --> 00:49:54.160
And then we have [inaudible]
in the '80s

00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:56.860
of the Kazakhs versus the Russians,

00:49:56.860 --> 00:50:04.610
even the communist [inaudible]
all of that history means that for

00:50:04.610 --> 00:50:08.000
[inaudible] you couldn't
[inaudible] I guess

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:13.040
in the strategic [inaudible]
of enemies --

00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:14.340
&gt;&gt; Sarah Cameron: Well, yeah.

00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:17.700
I mean, I agree and
sort of disagree.

00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:21.070
I mean, we've seen -- you
know, we've seen other examples

00:50:21.070 --> 00:50:24.730
where states -- where in
actuality these incidences

00:50:24.730 --> 00:50:27.170
of mass violence are
actually quite complicated,

00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:28.470
but various states have tried

00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:31.510
to promote a very simplified
history of it.

00:50:31.510 --> 00:50:32.990
So I think that would have been --

00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:37.600
you know, that would have been
possible to do in the Kazakh case.

00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:40.340
I wish I had brought it today.

00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:43.580
I forgot to include it
on my list of images.

00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:44.880
People always like to see it.

00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:47.190
But when I was there
living in Kazakhstan,

00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:50.120
I heard that there was a memorial
to the victims of the famine.

00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:52.160
I thought, you know, I'm
working on this topic.

00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:53.460
I've got to see it.

00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:54.760
Where is this memorial?

00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:57.640
So I went to all the scholars who
were working on the Kazakh famine.

00:50:57.640 --> 00:50:59.240
And I said, "Where
is this memorial?"

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:01.610
And they were, "Oh,"
scratching their heads.

00:51:01.610 --> 00:51:04.510
"Oh, you know, somewhere down
in al-Matin [assumed spelling].

00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:05.810
Oh, I don't remember."

00:51:05.810 --> 00:51:11.010
And so I spent, you know, several
weekends walking around al-Matin,

00:51:11.010 --> 00:51:14.130
hunting in parks, looking
for this memorial,

00:51:14.130 --> 00:51:15.880
which no one seemed
to know where it was.

00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:17.180
And I found it.

00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:19.040
And it was in a corner of a park.

00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:23.300 position:56%
There is a plaque that said -- this
was done I think in, you know, 1995.

00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:27.060
A plaque that -- which was sort
of covered with weeds, and so on.

00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:30.160
And it said, "In this place,
a memorial to the victims

00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:33.580
of the Kazakh famine will be built.

00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:37.010
So it's very interesting.

00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:38.310
Yeah, yeah.

00:51:38.310 --> 00:51:39.610
Yeah?

00:51:39.610 --> 00:51:41.900
&gt;&gt; Hello. Actually,
I am from Kazakhstan.

00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:45.040
&gt;&gt; Sarah Cameron: Yeah.

00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:51.050 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And my grandparents [inaudible]
they went from Kazakhstan to Russia.

00:51:51.050 --> 00:51:54.450
And they had [inaudible] thank
you so much for this research,

00:51:54.450 --> 00:51:58.970
and I know how it's
difficult to do research.

00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:04.350
Especially I know in the former
Soviet Union when there's no data,

00:52:04.350 --> 00:52:08.570
no [inaudible] and a lot of
this stuff is [inaudible].

00:52:08.570 --> 00:52:12.080
And a lot of things [inaudible]
told, it does make sense to me,

00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:14.360
because I'm coming
from that country.

00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:16.620
I totally understand.

00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:22.020
And what's interesting is that we
don't talk much about the famine

00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:24.280
in Kazakhstan, and we
[inaudible] because yeah,

00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:27.060
there's [inaudible] a history and

00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:29.510
[inaudible] that time,
it was very [inaudible].

00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:34.340
And the reason [inaudible] I
was always thinking why would

00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:35.640
you [inaudible]?

00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:38.990
And I think it's because
a lot of people

00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:41.230
in the world have [inaudible]
people,

00:52:41.230 --> 00:52:46.220 position:56%
they have very closer
relationship with Russia [inaudible]

00:52:46.220 --> 00:53:01.270 position:56%
and against the U.S. and [inaudible]
anyway, [inaudible] my question is.

00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:09.080
The research, how long did it
take you to do this research?

00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:14.730
And since Kazakhstan is such a
new country [inaudible] years,

00:53:14.730 --> 00:53:16.510
there are so many challenges,
so many things

00:53:16.510 --> 00:53:20.510
that have not been discovered yet.

00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:23.040
How did you choose this topic?

00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:24.340
&gt;&gt; Sarah Cameron: Oh, wow.

00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:27.250
So -- yeah, interesting
question so in --

00:53:27.250 --> 00:53:31.550
just a comment on your first point,
I think -- and again, why it's --

00:53:31.550 --> 00:53:34.120
I stress that I'm not
providing by any means a sort

00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:36.370
of definitive answer in
the question of memory.

00:53:36.370 --> 00:53:39.970
One sort of point I've also
thought about is that in thinking

00:53:39.970 --> 00:53:43.380
about this question in Kazakhstan,
one also needs to think that --

00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:45.490
I think many Kazakhs don't adhere

00:53:45.490 --> 00:53:48.880
to say standard Western
practices of commemoration, right.

00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:50.700
I've heard some Kazakhs
say to me, "You know,

00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:52.150
if we wanted to commemorate
something,

00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:53.990
we don't put up a monument," right.

00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:56.500
There's other different
practices of commemoration.

00:53:56.500 --> 00:53:59.710
And I think that may
be part of the story.

00:53:59.710 --> 00:54:02.350
So you're asking as to
how I came to the topic

00:54:02.350 --> 00:54:04.200
and how I was able to research it?

00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:08.390
Oh, and how long I -- so I spent a
lot of time in Kazakhstan, maybe --

00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:10.560
I don't know -- two
years on and off.

00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:15.590
And then I spent many -- too many
years researching it, actually.

00:54:15.590 --> 00:54:18.170
The way I first got
into the topic, I think,

00:54:18.170 --> 00:54:20.910
is I got quite interested
in Central Asia.

00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:25.060
I was doing a PhD in Soviet
history, and Kazakhstan

00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:27.960
from a pragmatic standpoint seemed
to be a really interesting region

00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:31.300
to study because it had been
so little written about it.

00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:34.320
And then furthermore, archival
access was actually a lot better

00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:37.340
than some of the other
republics like Uzbekistan

00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:41.310
in that both the state and the
Communist Party archives were open.

00:54:41.310 --> 00:54:43.330
So -- and also I really
felt that a lot

00:54:43.330 --> 00:54:45.380
of people generalized
about Central Asia.

00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:47.420
Most of the books have been
written about Uzbekistan.

00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:50.100
They said Uzbekistan stands
for all of Central Asia.

00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:54.410
Whereas -- yeah, I
see your face, right?

00:54:54.410 --> 00:54:58.650
That in reality a lot of these
republics are quite different

00:54:58.650 --> 00:55:00.110 position:56%
from the -- each other, and their --

00:55:00.110 --> 00:55:02.670
and you know, the divide
between the nomadic

00:55:02.670 --> 00:55:05.090
and sedentary peoples
is really huge.

00:55:05.090 --> 00:55:09.160
And so that's what sort of
interested me in Kazakhstan.

00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:12.780
When I went there and I
started to learn some Kazakh,

00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:17.370
I then started looking just
at school history textbooks,

00:55:17.370 --> 00:55:20.260
and I saw it -- you know, they're
all talking about this famine,

00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:23.130
and I have never even
heard of this, right,

00:55:23.130 --> 00:55:24.860
in my Soviet history textbooks.

00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:26.210
And it's not even there.

00:55:26.210 --> 00:55:29.130
So that's what sort
of pushed me into it.

00:55:29.130 --> 00:55:31.700
And I think I was lucky
in the end in my topic

00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:33.650
in that it was also a topic

00:55:33.650 --> 00:55:37.150
that every Kazakh could understand
why it was important for me

00:55:37.150 --> 00:55:39.290
to explain this to
an American audience.

00:55:39.290 --> 00:55:43.170
So I -- you know, just when I
was taking like taxicab rides,

00:55:43.170 --> 00:55:45.410
taxicab drivers would
tell me stories, right.

00:55:45.410 --> 00:55:46.710
"What are you doing here?"

00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:49.830
And so that -- for me that was
also a really interesting part

00:55:49.830 --> 00:55:51.890
of the topic.

00:55:51.890 --> 00:55:53.190
Yeah?

00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:54.680
&gt;&gt; Daniele Turello: Time
for one final question.

00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:55.980
&gt;&gt; Sarah Cameron: Oh, okay, yeah.

00:55:55.980 --> 00:55:58.490
Well, you're it.

00:55:58.490 --> 00:56:07.700
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] thank you so
much for your fascinating talk.

00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:11.040
[Inaudible]

00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:14.480
I had a couple of [inaudible]
questions.

00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:16.780
One has to do with [inaudible]

00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:26.660
there is kind of a saying
[inaudible] Kazakh, when one ceases

00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:28.130
to be a nomad, one
ceases to be a Kazakh.

00:56:28.130 --> 00:56:29.430
&gt;&gt; Sarah Cameron: Yeah.

00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:35.530
&gt;&gt; So I was fascinated

00:56:35.530 --> 00:56:41.110
by how [inaudible] Russian
nationalist [inaudible] definition

00:56:41.110 --> 00:56:45.510 position:56%
as Kazakh in the wake of the last --

00:56:45.510 --> 00:57:11.930
[ Inaudible ]

00:57:11.930 --> 00:57:17.530
And then my second
question, this has to do

00:57:17.530 --> 00:57:20.970
with [inaudible] the Soviet

00:57:22.310 --> 00:57:29.640
[inaudible] seems to
rest so much [inaudible]

00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:32.460
in particular [inaudible]

00:57:33.510 --> 00:58:27.230
[ Inaudible ]

00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:28.530
&gt;&gt; Sarah Cameron: Great, thank you.

00:58:28.530 --> 00:58:30.970
So the first question
about this question

00:58:30.970 --> 00:58:34.330
of national self-definition,
I think that's --

00:58:34.330 --> 00:58:37.140
it's still very much a
question in Kazakhstan.

00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:38.440
The interesting thing is

00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:40.440
in Kazakhstan right now
there is enormous effort

00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:43.100
to revive Kazakhs nomadic past.

00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:45.830
To -- in contrast to the
sort of standard line

00:58:45.830 --> 00:58:47.320
that nomads are very backward

00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:49.470
and this was not an
advanced civilization,

00:58:49.470 --> 00:58:53.010
there's enormous emphasis on
reviving the ancient roots

00:58:53.010 --> 00:58:55.510
of nomadism in Kazakhstan.

00:58:55.510 --> 00:58:59.780 position:56%
So they trace the history of Kazakhs
-- this is sort of a stretch,

00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:03.980
if you ask me -- all the
way back to the Scythians.

00:59:03.980 --> 00:59:08.700
And you know, trace the sort
of -- well, some scholars do.

00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:13.900
And so there's a lot of attempts
to try and stress the roots

00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:16.420
of nomadic culture in
Kazakh society today.

00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:19.960
For instance, hospitality, this is
always seen as something that was,

00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:23.080
you know, important to
nomadic -- in nomadic culture.

00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:27.630 position:56%
So there is an attempt, actually, to
in some way revive the nomadic past.

00:59:27.630 --> 00:59:30.280
There is also an increasing
interest, for instance,

00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:34.240
in a lot of Kazakhs -- genealogy is
something that's really important

00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:35.540
to nomads.

00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:38.650
It's both -- you know,
it's both an economic tie,

00:59:38.650 --> 00:59:40.660
something that's really
important to nomadism,

00:59:40.660 --> 00:59:43.490
but also a source of
identity and kinship.

00:59:43.490 --> 00:59:48.110
And there's been a new emphasis on
trying to trace one's genealogy.

00:59:48.110 --> 00:59:50.190
They've constructed
genealogical registers,

00:59:50.190 --> 00:59:52.240
which are very sort
of popular to buy.

00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:55.460
You can learn about your own
particular clan and its history.

00:59:55.460 --> 00:59:59.070
So to a certain extent,
yeah, that is being revived.

00:59:59.070 --> 01:00:03.640 position:56%
So in terms of your second question,
why so much energy to nomadism?

01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:06.010
Why is it seen as so threatening?

01:00:06.010 --> 01:00:07.310
Well, I think in its --

01:00:07.310 --> 01:00:11.090
it's something that I have actually
also sort of struggled with,

01:00:11.090 --> 01:00:13.150
because it is interesting --
I've always found it interesting

01:00:13.150 --> 01:00:18.130
that there was this sort of
pro-nomadism strain in the '20s,

01:00:18.130 --> 01:00:20.400
right, which then disappears.

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:25.040
But ultimately, I think nomadism
is in conflict with a couple ideas

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:27.230
that the Soviets are
putting forward.

01:00:27.230 --> 01:00:29.460
And you also raised the point

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:32.840
that these nomadic societies
are actually collect --

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:35.340
themselves, right, communal,
collective societies.

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:38.460
This is a point raised by Kazakh
communists in the '20s, "Look,

01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:40.350
we already have communism.

01:00:40.350 --> 01:00:42.800
You know, we're already doing
everything collectively."

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:46.910
So they actually raised -- right,
right, they raised that point.

01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:52.770
Yeah, but I think on a -- on the
level of say nation-building,

01:00:52.770 --> 01:00:56.140
if you have already decided that
nations correspond to territories,

01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:58.810
right -- Soviet nations
correspond to the -- to boundaries.

01:00:58.810 --> 01:01:01.180
Nomads actually do not
adhere to boundaries.

01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:04.120
They do not adhere to
international boundaries, right.

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:07.650
They cross -- there's a huge
Kazakh population in Xinjiang.

01:01:07.650 --> 01:01:10.750
There was even before the
famine, this province of China.

01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:15.400
So this is a problem, right,
trying to put in a conception

01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:19.450
of nationality that is rooted
in territory, if you're a nomad.

01:01:19.450 --> 01:01:23.330
I think another thing is that the
idea of the first five-year plan

01:01:23.330 --> 01:01:26.280
as it was developed was predicated

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:31.070
on actually getting
surpluses, right.

01:01:31.070 --> 01:01:33.830
Collectivization was
supposed to produce surpluses

01:01:33.830 --> 01:01:36.000
of meat, and of grain, and so on.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.600
And nomads, their -- the
kind of productive cycles

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:42.580
of nomadism do not go
in that way, right.

01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:44.670
This is not something
that's going to adhere

01:01:44.670 --> 01:01:46.360
to this vision of development.

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:49.440
So I think that's possibly
sort of two --

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:55.600
kind of two answers to
your question, right.

01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:57.510
Okay, thank you all.

01:01:57.510 --> 01:02:04.330
[ Applause ]

01:02:04.330 --> 01:02:06.720
&gt;&gt; Daniele Turello: Thanks so
much, Sarah, for that thorough

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:08.430
and thought-provoking presentation.

01:02:08.430 --> 01:02:11.350
I have one announcement
before we disperse,

01:02:11.350 --> 01:02:16.700
and that's that we will be back in
this space next Friday, October 28.

01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:21.760 position:56%
The Kluge Center has a McGuire Chair
in ethics and American history.

01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:26.050
And next Friday, McGuire -- a
past McGuire chair will be here,

01:02:26.050 --> 01:02:31.000 position:56%
and the lecture will be "The Economy
of Promises, Trust and Credit

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.700
in America," and that's
by Bruce Caruthers

01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:35.200
from Northwestern University.

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:37.540
And it's 3 o'clock on Friday.

01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:38.840
So we hope to see you then.

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:41.210
Thank you [applause].

01:02:42.770 --> 01:02:46.410

of the Library of Congress.
