TOUGH, BUT WE REALLY DO WANT TO
FOCUS ON TEXAS -- SPECIFICALLY

WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE SANDRA
BLAND INCIDENT.

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:17.884 line:91%
IT'S GOTTEN SO MANY PEOPLE
TALKING BECAUSE SO MUCH OF IT

00:00:17.917 --> 00:00:19.052 size:81% position:41% line:85%
REALLY DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:20.086 line:91%
A WOMAN WAS PULLED OVER FOR A
TRAFFIC STOP, AND A FEW DAYS

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:21.320 align:start position:0% line:91%
APPARENTLY COMMITS SUICIDE IN A
JAIL CELL.

00:00:21.353 --> 00:00:23.022 align:start position:0% line:91%
THERE'S STILL A LOT TO UNPACK IN
THIS STORY.

00:00:23.055 --> 00:00:24.123 align:start position:0% line:85%
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

00:00:24.156 --> 00:00:31.064 align:start position:0% line:91%
LET'S JUST LOOK AT THE DASHCAM
VIDEO THAT WAS RELEASED.

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:31.631 align:start position:0% line:85%

I'M WAITING ON YOU.

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:33.166 align:start position:0% line:85%
THIS IS YOUR JOB.

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:33.866 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO?

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:34.600 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW.

00:00:34.633 --> 00:00:35.401 size:75% position:38% line:85%
YOU SEEM VERY IRRITATED.

00:00:35.434 --> 00:00:36.569 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I AM.

00:00:36.602 --> 00:00:37.937 align:start position:0% line:91%
I REALLY AM, BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE
THIS IS CRAP FOR WHAT I'M

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:38.704 align:start position:0% line:85%
GETTING A TICKET FOR.

00:00:38.737 --> 00:00:40.440 line:85%
I WAS GETTING OUT OF YOUR WAY.

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:41.707 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU WERE SPEEDING AND TAILING
ME.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:42.375 align:start position:0% line:85%
SO I MOVE OVER.

00:00:42.408 --> 00:00:43.509 align:start position:0% line:85%
AND YOU STOP ME.

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:44.610 line:91%
SO, YEAH, I AM IRRITATED, BUT
THAT DOESN'T STOP YOU FROM

00:00:44.643 --> 00:00:50.116 align:start position:0% line:91%
GIVING ME A TICKET SO --
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU DONE?

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:50.783 align:start position:0% line:85%
Larry: OKAY.

00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:55.688 line:85%
THIS IS THE FIRST ESCALATION.

00:00:55.721 --> 00:00:56.722 size:84% position:42% line:85%
YOU ASKED HER THE QUESTION.

00:00:56.756 --> 00:00:58.724 align:start position:0% line:91%
SHE ANSWERED IT, AND THEN YOU
GOT A LITTLE SNIPPY.

00:00:58.757 --> 00:01:03.162 align:start position:0% line:91%
"ARE YOU DONE?" ISN'T HOW YOU
FINISH SOMETHING.

00:01:03.195 --> 00:01:04.564 align:start position:0% line:91%
"ARE YOU DONE?" IS HOW YOU START
SOMETHING.

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:06.265 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
RIGHT?

00:01:06.298 --> 00:01:08.167 align:start position:0% line:91%

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.001 align:start position:0% line:85%
JUST SAYIN'.

00:01:09.034 --> 00:01:10.303 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYIN'.

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:12.071 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY?

00:01:12.104 --> 00:01:14.674 line:91%
AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO KNOW
WHAT HE'S STARTING RIGHT NOW IS

00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:18.211 align:start position:0% line:85%
AN ESCALATION.

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:22.648 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU ASKED ME WHAT'S WRONG AND
I TOLD.

00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:23.416 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

00:01:23.449 --> 00:01:24.016 align:start position:0% line:85%
SO NOW I'M DONE, YEAH.

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:24.950 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY.

00:01:24.984 --> 00:01:28.354 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU MIND PUTTING OUT YOUR

(LAUGHTER)
&gt;&gt; Larry: OKAY.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.359 align:start position:0% line:85%
SHE SAID SHE WAS DONE.

00:01:33.392 --> 00:01:34.427 align:start position:0% line:85%
AND YOU KEPT ON GOING.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.828 size:81% position:41% line:91%
"YOU MIND PUTTING OUT YOUR
CIGARETTE, PLEASE?" IS THE

00:01:35.861 --> 00:01:39.732 align:start position:0% line:91%
DEFINITION OF NOT BEING
INTERESTED IN DONE.

00:01:39.765 --> 00:01:42.535 line:85%
YOU'RE FISHING FOR UNDONENESS.

00:01:42.568 --> 00:01:43.769 align:start position:0% line:85%
ALL RIGHT?

00:01:43.802 --> 00:01:45.805 line:91%
NOW, LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING IT'S
THE BEST IDEA TO BE SMOKING A

00:01:45.838 --> 00:01:47.306 line:85%
BUTT WHEN A COP PULLS YOU OVER.

00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:49.275 align:start position:0% line:85%
BUT YOU'RE ALLOWED TO.

00:01:49.308 --> 00:01:50.409 align:start position:0% line:85%
ALL RIGHT?

00:01:50.442 --> 00:01:54.347 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND IT DEFINITELY SHOULDN'T
RESULT IN THIS:

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.281 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I'M IN MY CAR.

00:01:55.314 --> 00:01:57.049 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHY DO I HAVE TO PUT OUT MY
CIGARETTE?

00:01:57.082 --> 00:01:58.885 size:84% position:42% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YOU CAN STEP ON OUT NOW.

00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:00.553 align:start position:0% line:91%
I DON'T HAVE TO STEP OUT OF
MY CAR.

00:02:00.586 --> 00:02:06.626 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; STEP OUT OF THE CAR.

&gt;&gt; STEP OUT OF THE CAR.

00:02:09.528 --> 00:02:11.030 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO
DO THAT.

00:02:11.063 --> 00:02:11.797 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I DO HAVE THE RIGHT.

00:02:11.831 --> 00:02:13.432 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOW STEP OUT OR I WILL REMOVE
YOU.

00:02:13.465 --> 00:02:16.302 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I REFUSE TO TALK TO YOU OTHER

00:02:16.335 --> 00:02:19.305 line:85%
&gt;&gt; GET OUT OR I WILL REMOVE YOU.

00:02:19.338 --> 00:02:20.640 align:start position:0% line:91%

GET OUT OF THE CAR NOW, OR I'M
GOING TO REMOVE YOU.

00:02:26.011 --> 00:02:27.580 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; AND I'M CALLING MY --

YOU'RE TRYING TO GIVE ME A
TICKET FOR FAILURE --

00:02:54.373 --> 00:02:55.208 line:85%
&gt;&gt; I SAID GET OUT OF THE CAR.

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:56.342 size:84% position:42% line:85%
WHY AM I BEING APPREHENDED?

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:58.711 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU OPEN MY CAR DOOR --
&gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO DRAG YOU OUT OF

HERE.

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:02.081 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO DRAG ME OUT
OF MY OWN CAR?

00:03:02.114 --> 00:03:03.749 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; GET OUT OF THE CAR!

00:03:03.782 --> 00:03:04.584 align:start position:0% line:85%
I WILL LIGHT YOU UP!

00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:05.451 align:start position:0% line:85%

HERE'S WHAT I SAW.

00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:15.661 align:start position:0% line:91%

ASKED FOR.

00:03:22.801 --> 00:03:25.538 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEN IT GOT CONFUSING BECAUSE HE
TOLD HER TO PUT OUT HER

00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:28.207 align:start position:0% line:91%
CIGARETTE BUT THEN OFFERED TO
LIGHT HER UP BY POINTING A TASER

AT HER HEAD.

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:35.014 align:start position:0% line:91%
TO ME AND MOST REASONABLE
PEOPLE, IT'S VERY CLEAR THIS

00:03:35.047 --> 00:03:39.652 align:start position:0% line:85%
OFFICER WAS WRONG.

00:03:39.685 --> 00:03:41.187 align:start position:0% line:91%

WRONG, DON'T YOU DO WHAT HE SAYS

00:03:42.988 --> 00:03:43.689 align:start position:0% line:85%
UNTIL AFTERWARDS.

00:03:43.722 --> 00:03:44.657 align:start position:0% line:85%
THEN YOU CAN SUE HIM.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.459 size:75% position:38% line:85%

IDEALLY, YES.

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:15.281 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT WAS IT.

00:05:15.314 --> 00:05:18.284 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHY IS SHE IN JAIL FOR THREE
DAYS?

00:05:18.317 --> 00:05:19.585 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; ON $5,000 BAIL!

00:05:19.618 --> 00:05:23.155 align:start position:0% line:91%
THERE NEEDS TO BE AN INTENSE
INVESTIGATION.

00:05:23.188 --> 00:05:32.765 align:start position:0% line:91%
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
(LAUGHTER)

00:05:32.798 --> 00:05:37.103 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THIS IS HOW YOU KNOW
HOW [ BLEEP ] CRAZY A SITUATION

00:05:37.136 --> 00:05:37.770 align:start position:0% line:85%
IS.

00:05:37.804 --> 00:05:42.742 align:start position:0% line:91%
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
RIGHT?

00:05:42.775 --> 00:05:45.378 line:91%
WHEN I TOTALLY AGREE WITH WHITE
PEOPLE WHO ARE TALKING ABOUT

00:05:45.411 --> 00:05:46.679 align:start position:0% line:85%
RACE ON FOX.

00:05:46.712 --> 00:05:49.782 align:start position:0% line:91%
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
RIGHT?

00:05:49.815 --> 00:05:51.083 align:start position:0% line:85%
OH!

00:05:51.116 --> 00:05:53.052 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S HOW CRAZY IT IS.

00:05:53.085 --> 00:05:55.388 align:start position:0% line:91%
ANYONE ELSE WHO I ALWAYS
VEHEMENTLY DISAGREE WITH ALSO

00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:56.155 align:start position:0% line:85%
GETTING THIS RIGHT?

00:05:56.188 --> 00:05:56.789 align:start position:0% line:85%
ANYONE?

00:05:56.822 --> 00:05:58.824 align:start position:0% line:85%
ANYONE?

00:05:58.857 --> 00:05:59.692 line:85%
&gt;&gt; I THOUGHT IT WAS TERRIBLE.

00:05:59.725 --> 00:06:05.498 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
&gt;&gt; Larry: YOU'VE GOT TO BE

00:06:05.531 --> 00:06:07.066 align:start position:0% line:85%
[ BLEEP ] ME!

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:09.869 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
&gt;&gt; I THOUGHT IT WAS TERRIBLE.

00:06:09.902 --> 00:06:11.070 line:85%
I THOUGHT HE WAS SO AGGRESSIVE.

00:06:11.103 --> 00:06:12.204 line:91%
IT WAS A TRAFFIC SIGNAL, AS I
UNDERSTAND IT, AND, YOU KNOW,

00:06:12.237 --> 00:06:13.339 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHO GETS OUT OF A CAR FOR A
TRAFFIC SIGNAL?

00:06:13.372 --> 00:06:14.740 align:start position:0% line:91%
I'M A HUGE FAN OF THE POLICE,
BUT THIS GUY WAS OVERLY

00:06:14.773 --> 00:06:15.374 align:start position:0% line:85%
AGGRESSIVE.

00:06:15.407 --> 00:06:16.942 align:start position:0% line:85%
TERRIBLY AGGRESSIVE.

00:06:16.975 --> 00:06:17.777 line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: EVEN TRUMP AGREES?!

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.846 align:start position:0% line:91%
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
RIGHT?

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:22.181 align:start position:0% line:85%
OH.

00:06:22.214 --> 00:06:23.349 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY.

00:06:23.382 --> 00:06:24.350 size:88% position:44% line:85%
WE HAVE LOST CABIN PRESSURE.

00:06:24.383 --> 00:06:29.221 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
PUT YOUR MASK ON FIRST.

00:06:29.254 --> 00:06:32.525 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
ALL RIGHT.

00:06:32.558 --> 00:06:36.061 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT IN ALL SERIOUSNESS, THERE'S
A LOT OF SPECULATION IN THE

00:06:36.094 --> 00:06:39.031 line:91%
MEDIA AND ONLINE RIGHT NOW ABOUT
WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED TO SANDRA

00:06:39.064 --> 00:06:40.232 align:start position:0% line:85%
BLAND.

00:06:40.265 --> 00:06:42.101 align:start position:0% line:91%
SOMETIMES THE MOST RATIONAL
THING TO SAY IS "I DON'T KNOW."

00:06:42.134 --> 00:06:46.405 line:91%
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO
SANDRA, AND TO ENGAGE IN A

00:06:46.438 --> 00:06:49.442 align:start position:0% line:91%
GUESSING GAME ABOUT HOW SHE
PASSED THIS OR THAT, IT CAN BE

00:06:49.475 --> 00:06:51.444 align:start position:0% line:85%
RECKLESS.

00:06:51.477 --> 00:06:53.145 line:91%
BUT I DO KNOW THAT THE RACIAL
CLIMATE IS SUPERCHARGED RIGHT

00:06:53.178 --> 00:06:54.379 align:start position:0% line:85%
NOW.

00:06:54.413 --> 00:06:57.516 line:91%
WE JOKED ABOUT IT EARLIER, BUT
THE BLACK COMMUNITY IS ON EDGE.

00:06:57.549 --> 00:06:59.919 line:91%
AND IT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME TO
SEE A BLACK WOMAN GET IRRITATED

00:06:59.952 --> 00:07:01.787 align:start position:0% line:85%
WITH A POLICE OFFICER.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.890 line:91%
JUST AS IT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME
TO SEE A POLICE OFFICER NEGLECT

00:07:04.923 --> 00:07:08.961 align:start position:0% line:91%
TO DE-ESCALATE A TENSE
SITUATION.

00:07:08.994 --> 00:07:12.965 align:start position:0% line:91%
(APPLAUSE)
I MEAN, TO ME --

00:07:12.998 --> 00:07:17.770 line:91%
IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE THEY WERE
TWO PLAYERS IN A GREEK TRAGEDY

00:07:17.803 --> 00:07:19.939 align:start position:0% line:91%
MARCHING TOWARD AN INEVITABLE
CONCLUSION.

00:07:19.972 --> 00:07:21.440 size:84% position:42% line:85%
SANDRA BRAND IS ONE VICTIM.

00:07:21.473 --> 00:07:24.543 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT HER STORY SPEAKS TO A LARGER
ISSUE.

00:07:24.576 --> 00:07:26.612 align:start position:0% line:91%
AN ISSUE WE SHOULD BE TRYING TO
SOLVE BEFORE IT BECOMES A

00:07:26.645 --> 00:07:27.513 align:start position:0% line:85%
PROBLEM AGAIN.

00:07:27.546 --> 00:07:28.447 align:start position:0% line:85%
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

00:07:28.481 --> 00:07:31.384 align:start position:0% line:91%
