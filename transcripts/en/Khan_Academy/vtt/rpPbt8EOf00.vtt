00:00:01.415 --> 00:00:02.790
SPEAKER 1: Well,
the biggest buzz

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.550
in education circles these days
is coming not from an educator,

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.190
but a one-time hedge fund
manager in Silicon Valley.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.830
The former Ivy League whiz
kid has revolutionized

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.930
math instruction with a
series of online lessons

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.160
that have gone viral on YouTube.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.980
Now as Elaine Korry
reports, his Khan Academy

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.480
is rocking California
classrooms.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.700
ELAINE KORRY: It all
started a few years ago

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.150
when Sal Khan watched his
young cousin, Nadia, struggling

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.620
with her math homework.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.770
He saw first hand
what he says is

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.850
wrong with math instruction
in America, a rigid model that

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.290
forces all students to
learn at the same pace.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.790
SALMAN KHAN:
Obviously, the best way

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.180
to tutor them is
not to tell Nadia,

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.580
I'm going to teach you
exponents for 10 minutes,

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.610
even if you only understand
exponents halfway,

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.690
I'm going to move on to negative
exponents in the next 10

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:51.190
minutes.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.640
ELAINE KORRY: Khan turned
that model on its head,

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.460
letting Nadia set her
own pace for learning.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.080
He began posting little 10
minute math lessons online,

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.900
and the rest is history.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.270
Today with 2,100 free tutorials,
the nonprofit Khan Academy

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.140
has the most popular education
website in the world.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.630
And a pilot program
begun last fall

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.250
in Los Altos public
schools, is proof

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.239
that self-paced math instruction
can also work in the classroom.

00:01:20.239 --> 00:01:22.030
CAMI THORDERSON: Good
morning, fifth grade.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.780
Great to see you this morning.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.390
I would remind you
that today we're

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.940
working on those fifth
grade goals in our classroom

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:28.900
on Khan Academy.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.610
So let's get busy.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.890
ELAINE KORRY: These 30 students
in Cami Thorderson's class,

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.060
are clustered in small
groups around laptops.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.200
Key to this experiment,
the kids work together

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.980
helping each other to
solve math problems posted

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.800
on the Khan Academy website.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.800
SPEAKER 2: So 2 is
x and 2 is also y.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.830
So parenthesis first.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.775
2 minus 1 equals 1.

00:01:54.775 --> 00:01:56.090
Yay.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.840
ELAINE KORRY: Andrew
and Ryan have already

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.180
mastered the fifth
grade curriculum,

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.430
so they've moved on to algebra.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.480
After finishing some of
Khan's online modules,

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.310
they test their understanding
in a series of exercises.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.310
SPEAKER 2: So you have
1 minus positive 3--

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.530
SPEAKER 3: Minus
3 is negative 2.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.322
Negative 2 times 6.

00:02:14.322 --> 00:02:15.238
SPEAKER 2: No, no, no.

00:02:15.238 --> 00:02:16.530
Remember order of operations.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.480
SPEAKER 3: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.855
ELAINE KORRY: Each
correct answer

00:02:18.855 --> 00:02:20.710
earns them energy points.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.650
Students compete
against each other

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.630
for the most points, which they
can redeem for cool badges.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.670
SPEAKER 2: So like, moon
badges aren't too hard,

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:29.545
because I have a lot.

00:02:29.545 --> 00:02:31.470
I have 227.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.080
But it gets hard about
here, at the Earth badges.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.910
ELAINE KORRY: While
the students are busy,

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.150
teacher Thorderson
wanders among them

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.890
with an electronic
tablet in hand.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.210
It displays a customized
Khan Academy graph

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.960
showing in real time what
each child is working on.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.620
Thorderson can zoom
in on any student

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.842
for a color coded
display of their work.

00:02:53.842 --> 00:02:56.300
CAMI THORDERSON: The blues are
the problems he got correct.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.140
The reds are the
problems he missed.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.530
And I can actually
then go to him

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.350
and say, let's look at this
problem that you missed.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.980
Let's work through
this a little bit.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.840
ELAINE KORRY: After six months
with the Khan Academy program,

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.620
Thorderson is spending less
time grading tests or preparing

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.450
lectures, and more time
actually teaching one-on-one.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.089
She's sold on the program.

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:17.130
CAMI THORDERSON: It's just
brought our math class

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.880
to a whole other level.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.300
And you can hear the
excitement in the collaboration

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.950
that happens in this classroom.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.260
They're talking to
each other about math.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.620
They're just excited.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.330
ELAINE KORRY: Some fifth
graders have surged ahead

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.800
and Khan Academy has helped
slower kids catch up.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.030
The pilot program
in seventh grade

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.630
targeted Los Altos students
who had fallen several grade

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.340
levels behind.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.120
Nearly all of them have
made good progress.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.030
Parents also seem to
support the Khan Academy

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.930
and the students say they prefer
it to their old math class.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.620
SPEAKER 2: It's not as boring
as writing in a textbook.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.370
SPEAKER 3: Yeah, there's
different modules

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.060
so you can do whatever you want.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.970
SPEAKER 4: And if we were doing
math in the textbook right now,

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.761
we wouldn't be
doing trigonometry.

00:04:05.761 --> 00:04:07.260
ELAINE KORRY: The
Los Altos District

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.165
is working with
Khan to include up

00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:12.530
to 1,000 students in
the program next fall.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.829
Meanwhile, he's been scooping up
accolades, awards, and millions

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.250
of dollars in funding from the
Gates Foundation and Silicon

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.839
Valley backers.

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:24.530
Khan's been criticized
as a dilettante,

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.510
and dismissed as just another
quick fix for education,

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:29.790
but he doesn't care.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.456
SALMAN KHAN: The
students, the teachers,

00:04:31.456 --> 00:04:33.270
everyone is way more
engaged, and there's

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.062
reason to believe that
many of the students

00:04:35.062 --> 00:04:36.936
are learning well ahead
of their grade level.

00:04:36.936 --> 00:04:39.650
And I'm not talking about 10%
ahead, I'm talking about three,

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:40.717
four grade levels ahead.

00:04:40.717 --> 00:04:42.300
ELAINE KORRY: By
September, Khan hopes

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.340
to have pilot programs in
a dozen school districts,

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.240
mostly in California.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.820
For the California
report, I'm Elaine Korry.
