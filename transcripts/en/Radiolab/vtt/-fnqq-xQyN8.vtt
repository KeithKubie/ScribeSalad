Y. S. E. N. P. E. R. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.

11
00:00:39.671 --> 00:00:43.000
This is radio lab podcast and today on the podcast we're going to talk about

12
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.990
containers. Well, no. Yeah, why not? Well, because it's bigger than containers.

13
00:00:46.991 --> 00:00:51.991
It's categories because with like the boring way as the borough word for design.

14
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.920
Oh, boring taxonomy. Can we say this? You could, yes.

15
00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.670
This is a story about what goes where and what doesn't go there and what should

16
00:01:00.671 --> 00:01:05.440
go there. If you were only smarter about it, just kind of measure you around.

17
00:01:05.441 --> 00:01:07.210
Yeah, that's, that's what I want to talk about.

18
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.640
I say you have a story to tell us, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.280
So you tell us your story. Set it up for us like, well,

20
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.050
let's start back in 1993 with two customs attorney, Sherry Sanger,

21
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.320
and my name is Andy Singer, singer and singer, singer, and saying,

22
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.340
and one day the two of them are looking at this customs book called the

23
00:01:24.341 --> 00:01:27.130
harmonized tariff schedule. What was it called again? The Harman. What?

24
00:01:27.131 --> 00:01:30.760
Harmonized tariff. You almost harmonized the harmonized tariff.

25
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.440
It's this huge book chock full of customs classifications,

26
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.840
products, milk products, vegetables,

27
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.820
and it's got everything in it and literally thousands of provisions.

28
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.420
They're flipping through this big book

29
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.440
and what they noticed that day

30
00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.420
is that in this book were the following words,

31
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.430
representing only human beings.

32
00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.800
They saw this fateful phrase right next to the word dog. Under the harmonize.

33
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.850
A doll was something that represented only a human being.

34
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.600
They don't represent it. A human being only a human being.

35
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.550
It could not be any other creature, but a human being. So Barbie is a doll,

36
00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.050
right? But here's the thing, in this big book right next to dolls,

37
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.720
it's this whole other category called toys, toys,

38
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.890
which covers things like monsters, robots, angels.

39
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.100
Basically anything that isn't only representing a human to the dolls are human

40
00:02:36.161 --> 00:02:38.830
and the toys are not human. Yeah.

41
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.210
And where it gets weird is that these two categories were being taxed

42
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.850
differently. How, how differently?

43
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.710
12% for dolls and 6.8% for toys. Really.

44
00:02:50.711 --> 00:02:52.720
So getting a Barbie doll into the country,

45
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.650
it would be more expensive than like importing a transformer or something. Yeah.

46
00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.080
Why? I assume it was because, uh, there was a domestic industry,

47
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.790
a domestic doll industry that, um, wanted and needed protection.

48
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.670
Do you think there was a, a powerful doll lobby

49
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.860
and you know, you got these two categories,

50
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.130
you've got these two ladies and they have a client called marvel comics,

51
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.570
marvel con. This is the home of men with capes and super powers. Yes.

52
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.560
And beautiful boots. Tights. Marvel. Yes. What about marvel? Well,

53
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.690
marvel comics has this universe of action figures coming into our reports as

54
00:03:34.691 --> 00:03:35.680
adults weight,

55
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.370
all their action figures were being classified as though everything was a doll.

56
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.270
Yeah. At 12% rate of duty and cheering.

57
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.760
Indie realized that there's a huge opportunity here.

58
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.680
If they can convince the government to remove the marvel action heroes from the

59
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.770
human ear Barbie doll category and push them into the robot de mini toy

60
00:03:57.011 --> 00:04:01.120
category, they can save a huge amount of money.

61
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.760
Lisa dollars, tens of thousands of maybe hundreds of dollars. We'll do how much?

62
00:04:06.761 --> 00:04:07.600
Thousands of dollars.

63
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.520
She's 50 a million dollars and then I'm more than a million dollars cause they

64
00:04:12.521 --> 00:04:15.580
wouldn't be taxed as high. This is, this is about more than just business.

65
00:04:15.581 --> 00:04:18.460
This is about more than Saturday morning cartoons.

66
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.470
This is about what it means to be a human, what you, we'll think about it.

67
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.220
They have to convince government officials that under US law,

68
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.220
these characters are not considered human

69
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.830
<v 3>[inaudible].</v>

70
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.560
<v 1>That's definitely really to share you in Indy headed to customs,</v>

71
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.060
customs headquarters in d c with a giant bag full of superheroes.

72
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.320
We actually went down there. We had a meeting, we brought samples, uh,

73
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.940
of all the items and you've got action figures. You mean we did,

74
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.150
we had 60 or 80 figures and one by one we tried to convince them,

75
00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.170
um, that these figures do not represent human being.

76
00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.690
And believe it or not,

77
00:05:03.691 --> 00:05:08.490
this meeting ended up in a series of court cases that went on for 10 years,

78
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.570
10 years. Cause we got really complicated and interesting.

79
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.990
So when they got to Marvel's crown tool, the x men,

80
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.330
they didn't even read the stories.

81
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.510
Sherry and I were not familiar with comic books sharing what they should have

82
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.160
because it's a great story.

83
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.420
I mean the story of x man is kind of about the next phase of human evolution.

84
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.240
Regular parents having regular kids,

85
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.990
but some of these kids around their awkward teen years,

86
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.690
you start to develop these strange mutant powers.

87
00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.050
So the story is humans who mutate out.

88
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.120
Well that's what makes this so legally tricky. I mean,

89
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:47.150
are these characters still human or have they evolved somehow out of humanness

90
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.180
into something entirely different? Now,

91
00:05:51.181 --> 00:05:55.680
the government says that all of the imported action figures,

92
00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.260
they are representations. Human beings, if they have things like a head,

93
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.970
a mouth, eyes, nose,

94
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.710
hair, arms, torso, breasts,

95
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:14.780
muscles. If you look at at, at any of these guys, cyclops,

96
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.760
he has all the basic elements that are the government's definition of a human

97
00:06:19.761 --> 00:06:24.170
being. And what do you say? Well, eventually to make their point,

98
00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.230
sharing an indie pulled out of gluten free guide.

99
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.530
X-Men fans might know as pieced. We can look at this

100
00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:37.020
one early on. Well, he's called beast. Even a,

101
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.220
he has two arms. He has two legs. Yeah.

102
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:45.620
Does have the with Roberts beast in the x men,

103
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.420
uh, storyline. He's a pretty, he's a pretty like a sophisticated guys.

104
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.600
They're like, he's, he's a thoughtful intellectual. Am I right? Like, yeah,

105
00:06:53.601 --> 00:06:57.740
you would be the first x men to keep trace glasses. He quoted Shakespeare,

106
00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:59.630
he quote Shakespeare, Shakespeare

107
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:06.720
show his condition and Bennett England. Now a bad,

108
00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.410
we'll count that manhood's cheap.

109
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:14.530
So don't you think that puts them well down the human's sort of a bell curve?

110
00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.420
Well in this case,

111
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.230
our argument would be is human beings do not have blue skin.

112
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:26.540
The judge agreed [inaudible] that's pretty, that's there. There are,

113
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.670
there are human beings with blueish skin.

114
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:32.250
You should know that there's a water to, uh,

115
00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:37.280
fit into the mold of what we customarily know as Yeoman. That's Joe Leibman.

116
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.410
He worked on the case for the government side.

117
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:43.520
He has aspects that perhaps are closer to the monster,

118
00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:47.210
but it gets trickier. Take the most popular acts, man,

119
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:54.110
Wolverine, he's got muscular arms and legs. Uh,

120
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:58.700
he puts on a coat and a flannel shirt and he's a logger. Sure, but the eyes,

121
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.880
they just didn't look human. And that's what our basic gun,

122
00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:04.780
the clause and the clause metal clause

123
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:11.240
in the story, a mad scientist implanted them in his arms under his skin.

124
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:14.620
But that just means he's a guy who had a little augmentation now. Well,

125
00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:20.090
he's developed something we don't know to actually exist.

126
00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:25.420
That does not mean that it might not exist in future humans in a world that we

127
00:08:26.541 --> 00:08:29.930
have not yet seen. Joe's basic point is don't rule it out.

128
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.990
He pointed to this runner, Oscar Pistorius,

129
00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:38.860
<v 4>they call him the blade runner. The world's fastest man on no legs,</v>

130
00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:43.550
<v 1>double amputee runner from South Africa who wears prosthetic legs that some</v>

131
00:08:43.551 --> 00:08:45.740
people claim actually increases speed

132
00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:49.300
<v 4>saying his prosthetics had more spring than human legs.</v>

133
00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:53.520
<v 1>And some people say he should be disqualified from competing against equal body</v>

134
00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:53.960
humans.

135
00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.860
<v 4>The body that governs track and field</v>

136
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:59.880
<v 1>banned him from competition. We'll forget about augmentation.</v>

137
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:02.160
What if we're just talking mutation? I mean,

138
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:07.020
as a human we have about 20,000 genes and if one of them just gives you Claus,

139
00:09:07.021 --> 00:09:11.610
that doesn't mean that the other 19,000, 999 genes.

140
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.540
Alright, keeping you pretty much in the human classification.

141
00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.100
<v 5>I S I studied, um,</v>

142
00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:22.030
my undergraduate degree is in microbiology and biochemistry.

143
00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:26.650
So I know that we have mutations wing on antibody constantly.

144
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:30.610
We're all mutants in common language. And in science fiction,

145
00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.170
when you use the word mutant,

146
00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:36.710
<v 1>she says, you mean something or someone that's disfigured.</v>

147
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.840
The helium that's no longer like us. So colloquially,

148
00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:45.310
if marvel calls the X-men Mutans, then they're not human.

149
00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:49.570
On the Wolverine case. Did you win or lose? We won. We won.

150
00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:56.120
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

151
00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.060
<v 1>which, well, how do you feel about this? Like</v>

152
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.890
I don't know. I, I'm kind of seeing red.

153
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:09.140
No, but seriously, here's the thing. In the x-men universe,

154
00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:13.640
all the x men are trying to do is fit into our world. I don't want to hurt you,

155
00:10:13.641 --> 00:10:17.630
Eric. I never get to feel like a human being the truth.

156
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:23.230
Marvel comics has created this world where mutans want to be treated like humans

157
00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:28.760
and the government is persecuting them as monsters. But in the real world,

158
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:30.320
it's exactly the opposite.

159
00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:34.850
You got marvels saying they're monsters and you've got the government saying,

160
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:37.910
no. Let them be human. In the x-men universe,

161
00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:41.690
humans are very often out to get the mutants or dismissive,

162
00:10:41.691 --> 00:10:44.840
the Mutans fearful of the mutants, liquidating them, experimenting on them.

163
00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:49.760
First of all, tell us who you are. I am Bryan singer. I'm a filmmaker.

164
00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:54.620
Bryan directed a bunch of the x men movies, x men, one x-men, two x men United,

165
00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:55.190
and he says,

166
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:59.720
all the movies at their heart are parables about living in a world where you

167
00:10:59.721 --> 00:11:02.250
don't fit. You're not the right

168
00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:03.320
<v 6>category. In fact,</v>

169
00:11:03.321 --> 00:11:08.030
the first x men filled me direct u s government fears meeting so much that this

170
00:11:08.031 --> 00:11:12.680
US senator puts forward legislation called the mutant registration act.

171
00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:16.190
Newton's are very real and they are among us.

172
00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.190
We must know who they are.

173
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:22.880
And above all we must know what they can do.

174
00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.900
That us them conflict is key to the entire saga.

175
00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:27.581
<v 1>Well, yeah,</v>

176
00:11:27.581 --> 00:11:31.300
and that's no coincidence that it was born during the height of the civil rights

177
00:11:31.301 --> 00:11:34.680
movement. So this is like, so this is modeled then on a civil and on,

178
00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:38.830
on a moment in in world history where people were trying to figure out how to

179
00:11:38.831 --> 00:11:41.560
either get along or not get along. Yeah, absolutely.

180
00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:46.160
This tension plays out within the mutans themselves. Well, you have two groups,

181
00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:51.280
the x men who choose to take the stance to defend a world that hates and fears

182
00:11:51.681 --> 00:11:54.200
them don't give up on the marriage. Then you've got this other group

183
00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.500
<v 6>of mutants led by Magneto or what are you having to do, Charles?</v>

184
00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:00.620
And he doesn't have faith that humanity's ever going to embrace mutans.

185
00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:04.210
We are the fear Church House. Not Them. I know matter.

186
00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:08.180
He saw that what happens when you're different is you get rounded up,

187
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.000
experimented them, eliminate and your guests.

188
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:14.360
It's interesting to hear you describe that because when I,

189
00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:17.150
when I walked out of the, the most recent movie,

190
00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:20.480
I felt such a strong,

191
00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:25.040
maybe a stronger connection with magneto after you saw what he went through.

192
00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:25.990
Yeah. You see the,

193
00:12:25.991 --> 00:12:30.890
the intimate victimization of him and you root for him because he's ultimately

194
00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:34.700
facing a monster. And when he was making these movies,

195
00:12:34.701 --> 00:12:38.750
he had that monster of intolerance and prejudice on his mind.

196
00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:41.540
And it was actually pretty personal to him. Oh,

197
00:12:41.541 --> 00:12:46.310
there's a photo album my family has. And um, it's, it starts in the 20s.

198
00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:48.620
And I was looking through it and I recognize the lineage.

199
00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:51.950
And then there were a few pages of just these portraits of different people.

200
00:12:51.951 --> 00:12:53.780
I didn't know who they were. And I said to my dad, I'm like,

201
00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:57.260
who are these people? And my dad goes, they're all gone.

202
00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:02.000
They're the ones that are gone from Poland.

203
00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:05.000
They're just all gone. They're there, they're erased. There's no records,

204
00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:08.270
there's no property, there's no nothing. So he doesn't even know their name.

205
00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:08.630
Nope.

206
00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:11.840
We just know that there are people that were part of the neighborhood and the

207
00:13:11.841 --> 00:13:12.950
family, uh,

208
00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:17.960
in the 30s that never left Poland like my grandparents did and,

209
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:20.950
and disappeared. Well,

210
00:13:20.951 --> 00:13:23.320
and I know this sounds pretty heavy for a comic book,

211
00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:28.860
but over the years the x men have been a stand in for first the civil rights

212
00:13:29.201 --> 00:13:33.760
movement of the 60s and most recently the story works as an allegory for gay

213
00:13:33.761 --> 00:13:35.320
rights. In fact, the next men too,

214
00:13:35.321 --> 00:13:38.770
we actually had a coming out scene in the scene. This kid Bobby Drake,

215
00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:42.040
he's hiding some of the x men in his parent's house and then his parents come

216
00:13:42.041 --> 00:13:46.710
home and find him with these strangers to be at school. Bobby,

217
00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.590
who is this guy and he is forced basically to show his parents that he's a

218
00:13:50.591 --> 00:13:52.510
mutant. There's something I need to tell you.

219
00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:57.070
So everyone takes a seat in the living room and Bobby using his special mutant

220
00:13:57.071 --> 00:13:59.590
powers, he freezes a Little Cup of coffee.

221
00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:06.020
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

222
00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:10.640
<v 6>and the parents react in panic and the mother actually says, have you tried</v>

223
00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:15.500
not being a mutant? Really like it's a choice.

224
00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.360
<v 1>[inaudible] we have to get to it. We have to find it.</v>

225
00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:22.560
Like what the ultimate legal just disposition of this case was. Yeah.

226
00:14:22.561 --> 00:14:23.101
So did they,

227
00:14:23.101 --> 00:14:27.030
did they in the end say that these characters were human or did they perpetuate

228
00:14:27.031 --> 00:14:28.050
this retail bigotry?

229
00:14:28.051 --> 00:14:32.910
I can say that they were non-humans you guys really want to know. Yeah, we are.

230
00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:36.090
We have to know. We have to come on. Yeah, exactly. Tell us

231
00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:40.200
non-humans. Ah, seriously.

232
00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:44.760
Eventually the judge ruled that all marvel heroes,

233
00:14:44.761 --> 00:14:47.070
not just the x men are not human.

234
00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:51.620
So Sherry an indie one, we're not rights

235
00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:58.550
the, when you're, when you're having your nice meal after the,

236
00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:02.120
after the case and you don't feel that at all,

237
00:15:02.121 --> 00:15:07.121
that you have just robbed humanity from the whole population.

238
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:11.930
We had absolutely no guilt at all. Like

239
00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:13.043
<v 7>none.</v>

240
00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:22.453
[inaudible]

241
00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.090
<v 1>wow. Well, thank you. I can, you're welcome chat.</v>

242
00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.700
That would be [inaudible] Kinda Raja. I report to run this story.

243
00:15:29.701 --> 00:15:33.060
We also had a fine producer, Matthew Kielty,

244
00:15:33.061 --> 00:15:36.180
who is just left us for greener pastures. Thank you, Matt.

245
00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:40.140
I remember Krulwich and I am [inaudible] and thanks for listening.
