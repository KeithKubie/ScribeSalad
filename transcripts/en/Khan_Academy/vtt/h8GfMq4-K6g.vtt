00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.762
When you are 13
and 1/2 years old,

00:00:05.762 --> 00:00:07.470
you need to be learning
negative numbers.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.970
When you are 14, you need
to be learning exponents.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:10.600
That's silly.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.975
You need to be
learning exponents

00:00:11.975 --> 00:00:13.917
once you really
understand multiplication.

00:00:13.917 --> 00:00:15.750
And you need to be
learning negative numbers

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.510
once you really understand
the number line.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.080
Once you get rid of the
stigma and you open it up,

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.913
and everyone's a learner
and everyone's just

00:00:20.913 --> 00:00:22.595
on the same playing
field, it actually

00:00:22.595 --> 00:00:23.720
is empowering for everyone.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.303
I have a two-year-old
son named Emron,

00:00:25.303 --> 00:00:28.840
and obviously I care about
what his academic experience is

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:29.730
going to look like.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.520
And I'm hoping that
when he's five or six,

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.020
he goes to a classroom that not
only has five or six-year-olds

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.690
in it, but has kids of all
ages in that one classroom.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.700
It's kind of a reversion back
to the one room schoolhouse.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.940
And when he goes to that
classroom, some part

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.148
of his day-- and I'm not
talking about the whole day,

00:00:45.148 --> 00:00:46.700
maybe 20 to 30
minutes of the day,

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.460
especially for the
core subjects--

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.292
are spent on the Khan
Academy watching videos.

00:00:51.292 --> 00:00:53.750
And by that time, it won't just
be mathematics and science.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:54.541
It will be grammar.

00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:56.760
It'll be vocabulary.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.150
He starts with the
most basic concepts.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.030
He doesn't move on to
more advanced concepts

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.269
until he shows that he is
110% proficient at the more

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.510
basic ones, and then
it moves him on.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.310
And he gets data,
and he gets feedback,

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.890
and his teachers get feedback.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.114
And the paradigm is,
all of these students

00:01:12.114 --> 00:01:13.530
at all different
ages, they're all

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.800
going to be working at their
own pace in every class,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.500
in grammar, in
mathematics, in everything.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.880
The teacher now, instead of
having to give this one size

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.460
fits all lecture to everybody,
can now look at the data,

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.430
see where every student
is, and the software

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.750
identifies who's stuck.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.170
The teacher every now and
then, will sit next to Emron,

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.960
and help Emron as
a mentor, actually

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.146
have that human interaction.

00:01:32.146 --> 00:01:34.020
And even better, if the
teacher isn't around,

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.394
or even if the
teacher is around,

00:01:35.394 --> 00:01:38.180
it might be better for Emron to
be tutored by one of his peers.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.840
Maybe another six year
old, maybe a 10-year-old

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.570
who's a little ahead
of the curve, who's

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.112
well respected as
a teacher already.

00:01:44.112 --> 00:01:45.820
I mean, what's really
exciting about this

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.770
is an interactive experience.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.892
I cringe at the idea
of my son in a room,

00:01:49.892 --> 00:01:52.350
at the same rooms that I used
to sit in, sitting like this,

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.620
staring at the clock,
waiting for the bell to ring.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.180
I don't want him to
do that for 12 years.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.763
I want him interacting
with his peers.

00:01:57.763 --> 00:01:59.530
I want him teaching his peers.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.810
I want my son to be
respected in his classroom,

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.330
not because he got a
perfect on his SATs,

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.885
not because he's the
smartest kid in the class.

00:02:09.885 --> 00:02:11.510
I want him to be
respected because he's

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.230
the best teacher in the class,
because he communicates well,

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.840
because he has
empathy for his peers,

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.298
because he's always
willing to stop

00:02:17.298 --> 00:02:19.781
what he's doing to help
one of his friends.

00:02:19.781 --> 00:02:22.030
I think if that happens than
I wouldn't worry too much

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.825
about what my son
does afterwards.
