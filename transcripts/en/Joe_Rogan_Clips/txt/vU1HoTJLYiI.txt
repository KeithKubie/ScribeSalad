Speaker 1:          00:00          Do you think there's ever going to be a time in, in humans, like whether it's a hundred years from now or a thousand years now where there's no war? Yes, yes I do. How do you see that happening? Well, it's going to start with the cop cars with flags on them and then they're going to patrol her hat. I think it would be technology and I think it's a matter of everybody becoming more comfortable if you can, if you can have people, this is like a Thomas Friedman idea that if, if you want to stop like people fighting in the Middle East, uh, give them all the comforts of a good society, let them be able to go eat McDonald's and sit in a coffee shop and all of a sudden you don't want to fight as much. And that means prosperity. That means popping. So I think technology, if you can bring more water to people and there's less suffering, if climate change doesn't Jim ruin all of that?

Speaker 1:          00:55          I think if you can prop these people up and give all these people, if they can rise, then there's no sense. I mean, we're in a point now where there's fewer wars than ever before on the planet. Sure. So we're headed in that direction. So I don't see why not. Well, as a thought exercise, let's look at it this way. What makes anybody decide to act as a group? What makes anybody like if, why would we decide to go? Like if, if right, what negotiations should we be having with someone in Germany? Like why, why, why are we having a conversation about anything you live way the fuck over there on the other side of the ocean. What would make people act as a group and go over and try to fuck with somebody else that's in another place? Well, people can be, people can definitely be rallied for any cause most certainly.

Speaker 1:          01:48          But do you think this is my thought, that there will come a time where that kind of rallying doesn't work, that people will stop believing? I mean, this is one of those very bizarre ideas that the systems that we've established for, for human civilizations, whether it's countries or cities or, um, continents, right? Whatever it is. These systems, once all the boundaries that kept people from freely traveling, although once those are dissolved the country anymore, they keeping this, keeping it together now is the fact that it's air travel so they know when you're coming in and they get to check your papers. Oh, you're flying in from overseas. Arguments to papa was only one way. Motherfucker, you've gotta land right here, right in this spot. And then we take each individual and we say, can I see your paperwork? What do you got? Who are you?

Speaker 1:          02:37          Where are you from? Where are you born? Do you have money or you're a drug addict. You ever been arrested? And then they're allowed. They could still do that that way. If that didn't exist, if it was way easier to go to Germany, there was a technology that would allow you, like a person like you or made the same way we could drive places. We could just fly into somewhere and land anywhere. You don't have to go to a fucking specific location like an airport or get through a road that takes you to some, you know, some checkpoints station like when you're trying to drive from Mexico. Just if people could fly. Yeah. If people, if people flew anywhere they wanted to go, if that technology existed, good fucking luck keeping people from coming into your city. Good luck. All those rules are out the window.

Speaker 1:          03:20          All those immigration rules that doesn't exist anymore. Can't exist. People can go anywhere. They want to write it, but what are you saying that gives you, well, the gives you the interaction with human beings like and that in a way you, you won't be able to get them as a group as easily to go after another group. Right. Because now there's no country basically. There's no like thing to, we're not part of this that has to go fight that. Right. We're all in. We're all one now here's the do have one person lives in a great spot and didn't want to give up their oil. Right. Right. Then it becomes a problem. Right. Come on. Resources. We're all in this together. Those people in Alaska, you know they got all that fucking oil, bro, here's happened. Here's two things though. Here's two things of why it might not work once technology thousand things, but yeah, but I only two that I can think of. Okay, let me hear a one.

Speaker 1:          04:11          Italians are Italians and Germans are Germans and Mexicans are Mexicans and you get around your people and you feel it and you know it and I know who you are and we're part of that tribe and we're part of that thing and it doesn't matter that we grew up somewhere. I just know you as an Italian and I'm an Italian and I am with you and that is very different from that Turkish guy over there. That thing, that very human thing. Chemistry thing of your own blood, your own thing. I don't think that's going to go away for Bro. You're old school and you bake bread. I didn't. You're talking nonsense. You're really into old things. You know what I mean? I do love all the time. You fix your eyes without glasses, you'd be like, Nah, I like the class. Make you feel like, I think I put them on and get ready to go to work, but I think that's a real thing. I think, of course, than cars and your friend did, your friend, you give him, hey, it's not that bad and the shit is actually really good for fertilizer.
