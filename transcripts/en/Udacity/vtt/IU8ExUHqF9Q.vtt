00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now let's get back to the general complexity classes.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So we have already drawn this picture here--the hierarchy of P versus NP,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
versus EXPTIME, versus NEXPTIME.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.500
And, of course, there are other complexity classes

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.000
that we have gotten to know in this course.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So there's the class of fixed-parameter tractable problems.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Then we looked at problems for which there are or are not approximation algorithms.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So we had problems for which there was a PTAS,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.500
we had some problems for which there was a constant factor approximation,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.500
and we also mentioned that there are problems such as clique

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.000
and independent set for which there's no constant factor approximation

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
unless P=NP.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And then, finally, we looked at randomized algorithms where we said there were

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Monte Carlo algorithms--those were the problems that were guaranteed to run

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
in polynomial time but only with a certain probability give us a correct solution.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.800
And then we also mentioned Las Vegas algorithms which are algorithms that

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.000
guarantee us a correct solution, but the running time is only polynomial

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
with a certain given probability.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Of course, we can also start building hierarchies here,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
so we can do a hierarchy for approximation,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and we can do a hierarchy for randomized algorithms.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And guess what--this is going to be our next quiz.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So as in the quiz before, when we talked about P, NP, EXPTIME, and NEXPTIME,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I'm, again, giving numbers to these complexity classes here, and, again,

00:01:19.000 --> 99:59:59.000
I would like you to enter the numbers here so that we form a nice hierarchy.
