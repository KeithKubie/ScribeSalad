00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.150
- [Voiceover] So let's say
that we have the equation

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.220
negative seven x minus eight y

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.710
is equal to 28.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.090
So this right over here,
this is a linear equation,

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.220
it's in standard form,

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.580
and what I want to do
with you in this video

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.580
is I want to rewrite this
in slope-intercept form.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.250
And so, just as a reminder,

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.117
this right over here is standard form

00:00:27.117 --> 00:00:31.367
and I want to convert it
to slope-intercept form,

00:00:34.517 --> 00:00:38.987
which has the form of y is
equal to the slope times x

00:00:38.987 --> 00:00:43.957
plus the y-coordinate of the y-intercept.

00:00:43.957 --> 00:00:45.917
So let's see how we do this.

00:00:45.917 --> 00:00:48.187
It's just gonna take a little
bit of algebraic manipulation

00:00:48.187 --> 00:00:50.717
and, like always, I encourage
you to pause the video

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:53.657
and try to work through it
on your own before I do it.

00:00:53.657 --> 00:00:54.957
So what we really wanna do is we just

00:00:54.957 --> 00:00:57.817
wanna isolate the y here
on the left hand side

00:00:57.817 --> 00:01:00.757
so I wanna get rid of
this negative seven x

00:01:00.757 --> 00:01:03.317
and the best way to get
rid of a negative seven x

00:01:03.317 --> 00:01:05.277
is to add seven x, so I'd wanna

00:01:05.277 --> 00:01:07.457
add seven x to the left hand side

00:01:07.457 --> 00:01:09.417
but in order to maintain this equality,

00:01:09.417 --> 00:01:11.117
I've gotta do it to both sides.

00:01:11.117 --> 00:01:14.677
So let's add seven x to both sides

00:01:14.677 --> 00:01:19.287
and then I'm going to be left with,

00:01:19.287 --> 00:01:21.987
on the left hand side,
negative seven x plus seven x,

00:01:21.987 --> 00:01:26.337
those cancel out, so
I get negative eight y

00:01:26.337 --> 00:01:30.567
is equal to seven x plus 28.

00:01:33.657 --> 00:01:35.617
And now, I just want a y out here,

00:01:35.617 --> 00:01:37.787
so I wanna get rid of this
negative eight coefficient

00:01:37.787 --> 00:01:38.717
and the best way to do that

00:01:38.717 --> 00:01:41.617
is divide both sides by negative eight.

00:01:41.617 --> 00:01:44.487
So divide both sides by negative eight

00:01:44.487 --> 00:01:46.887
and what are we left with?

00:01:46.887 --> 00:01:49.087
On the left hand side,
you're left with just y,

00:01:49.087 --> 00:01:51.517
that's why we divided by negative eight,

00:01:51.517 --> 00:01:54.857
y is equal to seven
divided by negative eight,

00:01:54.857 --> 00:01:58.617
that's negative 7/8 x,

00:01:58.617 --> 00:02:00.347
and then eight divided by negative eight

00:02:00.347 --> 00:02:03.017
is negative one, minus one.

00:02:03.017 --> 00:02:04.747
And just like that we have written it

00:02:04.747 --> 00:02:07.977
in slope-intercept form.

00:02:07.977 --> 00:02:09.987
We rewrite it in this form, it
immediately jumps out at us,

00:02:09.987 --> 00:02:11.917
that the slope here is negative 7/8,

00:02:11.917 --> 00:02:13.917
or the slope of the line
that would represent

00:02:13.917 --> 00:02:16.517
all of the solutions to
this linear equation,

00:02:16.517 --> 00:02:18.587
all the x,y pairs that satisfy it,

00:02:18.587 --> 00:02:21.087
and the y-intercept, if we
were to graph that point,

00:02:21.087 --> 00:02:23.257
the coordinates of that point would be

00:02:23.257 --> 00:02:25.787
zero comma negative one.

00:02:25.787 --> 00:02:28.287
That's the value of this
form right over here,

00:02:28.287 --> 00:02:32.459
slope-intercept form.
