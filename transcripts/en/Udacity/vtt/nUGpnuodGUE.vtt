00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.876
When I think about entrepreneur and
what I want in entrepreneurs,

00:00:03.876 --> 00:00:07.056
it's a great question because
it at the end of the day,

00:00:07.056 --> 00:00:09.705
an entrepreneur is
full of contradictions.

00:00:09.705 --> 00:00:12.233
And the people that
are really those great,

00:00:12.233 --> 00:00:16.950
great entrepreneur that I'm looking for,
they're very strange people because

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.840
let's take a few of
these contradictions.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.770
To start with, these are people
that are what we call alpha dogs.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.240
They run, they stop,
they brake for no one.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.100
They know what to do at any given point.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.110
On the other hand, they're never
that good if they can't take advice.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.470
But it's pretty much in contradiction
because these people that just run

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.190
forward, they're usually not
the ones that take advice.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.439
Well, great entrepreneurs are.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.050
When you look at entrepreneurs,
there are people that are very smart so

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.198
they understand that the chances of a
startup to succeed are roughly 1 out of

00:00:46.198 --> 00:00:48.110
20 because that's the statistics.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.718
On the other hand, the great ones
never believe that they're going to be

00:00:50.718 --> 00:00:53.172
the ones failing, they know that
they're going to go on succeeding.

00:00:53.172 --> 00:00:54.819
Again, they're creating
their own reality.

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:58.811
And the third thing is that,
these entrepreneurs, they wake up in

00:00:58.811 --> 00:01:04.650
the morning, and they know 100% that
they're going in the right direction.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.460
By the afternoon, they can pivot
the company because they ran into

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.490
a new piece of data that forced them to
change their view, but they will wake up

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.480
the next morning again, being 100%
sure that they're running in the right

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.360
direction, which is a totally
different direction than yesterday.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.250
And so these qualities are basically
the main qualities that I look

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.135
in entrepreneurs.

00:01:23.135 --> 00:01:25.410
When I find the ones that are like that,
these are the one hour meetings, right?

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.999
These are the one hour meetings,
and after that I say hey,

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:33.060
that's a perfect personality
fit to be an entrepreneur.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.630
I don't care what your field.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.020
You may pivot, for all I care, 20 times,
but I want to be part of that journey,

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.780
because that's a person
that's going to succeed.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.039
That's an entrepreneur that
has everything it takes.
