[MUSIC - "TESTIMONY"]

00:02:56.414 --> 00:02:59.300
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:05.553 --> 00:03:07.260
ERIN MACKEY: Hi.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.980
I'm Erin Mackey and
I play May Catlett

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.360
in the show which-- Vince
just sang a song that's

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.840
John Newton's song.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.090
He's the main person we
follow throughout the story,

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.560
and Mary Catlett was the love
of his life, his childhood love.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.710
And the song Vince just sang is
really a moment in John's life

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.990
where he finally kind of
sees the wrongdoing he's

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.610
been doing-- how
he's been living

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.800
his life has been really bad.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.730
And Mary-- and she
was a real person,

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.340
all these people they
were really alive--

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.980
and she always believed in him.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.410
She believes that
he could change.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:49.360
She just believed that there
was more in him than what

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.380
he was doing with his
life and that there

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.890
was so much good in him still.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.016
So, this song I'm going to sing
is called "I Still Believe."

00:03:58.016 --> 00:06:01.180
[MUSIC  - "I STILL BELIEVE"]

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.180
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.950
LAIONA MICHELLE: Hello there.

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.540
My name is Laiona Michelle.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.220
I'm so happy to be here.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.550
I play the role of Nanna, a
house slave from Sierra Leone.

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.200
And I'm going to sing for
you a song called "Daybreak."

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.340
It's the song that
encourages Mary

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.960
to find the light
within herself in order

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.340
to be the voice of the
abolitionist movement.

00:06:36.704 --> 00:06:39.174
[MUSIC - "DAYBREAK"]

00:09:11.462 --> 00:09:13.446
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:23.960
CHARLES E. WALLACE:
Good afternoon.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.950
The hits keep coming.

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:29.300
My name is Charles E. Wallace.

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.470
And this particular
song takes place

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:33.370
in the second act
of the show where

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:37.630
Thomas, John Newton's
manservant-- slave--

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:40.190
has just been betrayed by him.

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:43.500
And this is the answer
to that betrayal.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:48.028
I give you "Nowhere
Left to Run."

00:09:48.028 --> 00:09:50.418
[MUSIC - "NOWHERE LEFT TO RUN"]

00:12:47.339 --> 00:12:50.273
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:11.135 --> 00:13:12.719
ERIN MACKEY: Shall
we set this one up?

00:13:12.719 --> 00:13:13.218
OK.

00:13:13.218 --> 00:13:13.750
Yup!

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:16.970
This next song actually
happens earlier in the show.

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:19.550
Again, my character
Mary Catlett--

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:24.560
she is becoming aware of
the reality of slavery

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:28.159
and the horrible
abuse of these people

00:13:28.159 --> 00:13:29.450
and oppression of these people.

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:31.470
And she is starting
to ask questions.

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:33.420
It takes place in
1744 England, so this

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:37.930
is very early on in England's
move toward abolition.

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:42.480
And she meets some
people in her town

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.522
who are fighting
against this injustice

00:13:45.522 --> 00:13:47.980
and they're trying to get her
on board for this song called

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:51.742
"We Are Determined."

00:13:51.742 --> 00:13:54.664
[MUSIC - WE ARE DETERMINED"]

00:16:33.838 --> 00:16:36.298
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:47.077
ALAN SEALES: Why do you feel
like nobody has-- at least

00:16:47.077 --> 00:16:48.660
personally I feel
like a lot of people

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:50.120
have not heard of John Newton.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.311
Like, he is the author
of one of the songs

00:16:52.311 --> 00:16:53.310
that is sung everywhere.

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:54.820
Everyone knows "Amazing Grace."

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:56.452
So where-- hi--

00:16:56.452 --> 00:16:57.827
CAROLYN ROSSI
COPELAND: You know,

00:16:57.827 --> 00:17:00.690
when I first was introduced to
this property, I was mortified,

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:01.960
embarrassed.

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.355
I mean, I considered
myself well-read

00:17:04.355 --> 00:17:06.450
and I couldn't believe I
didn't know this story.

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:09.369
I mean, he is more important
than Abraham Lincoln, Martin

00:17:09.369 --> 00:17:11.260
Luther King, on and on and on.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.569
He is the man who began
the abolitionist movement.

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:17.435
I guess 200 years from now
we're probably not going

00:17:17.435 --> 00:17:19.390
to remember a lot of
people, but we're really

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:23.359
thrilled to be bringing him at
the forefront of the culture

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:24.739
and into the Broadway community.

00:17:24.739 --> 00:17:26.280
ALAN SEALES: Well,
why do you think--

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:27.279
why do we think that is?

00:17:27.279 --> 00:17:29.520
That, I mean, in America
we're taught specifically

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.390
the history of
America, which is just

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:33.391
Abraham Lincoln pretty much.

00:17:33.391 --> 00:17:35.390
After I saw the show-- I
saw the show last week,

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:36.885
and it was phenomenal.

00:17:36.885 --> 00:17:38.260
And I went home
and I immediately

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.970
started researching
all about John Newton

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:42.680
and about the British
side of all this.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.514
And was like, oh I thought
America did all this but like--

00:17:45.514 --> 00:17:47.430
CAROLYN ROSSI COPELAND:
Well, we were British.

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:49.800
ALAN SEALES: Right,
we were British.

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:53.710
Right, so how much did
you guys individually

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:56.860
learn about this once you
started with the organization,

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:58.520
with the show?

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:00.760
ERIN MACKEY: Well, for me,
I just started with a show

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.140
last year.

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:04.890
Some people have been with
it much longer than that.

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:08.100
But I auditioned for the show
and I didn't know anything

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:09.130
about John Newton.

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:11.520
I read the script and
I was like, oh wow,

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.170
they really made a really
cool dramatic story.

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:15.520
This can't possibly be true.

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:16.815
And it's real.

00:18:16.815 --> 00:18:18.700
I was like this is
stranger than fiction.

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:19.930
I spoke to the
director on the phone

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:22.096
and I remember asking him,
how much of this is true?

00:18:22.096 --> 00:18:24.560
And he's like--
there's this character,

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:25.560
this princess character.

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:26.768
I was like, oh she's made up.

00:18:26.768 --> 00:18:27.620
No, she's not.

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:28.790
She's real.

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:29.680
I was like, wow!

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:34.849
I couldn't believe just how
incredible, truly, stranger

00:18:34.849 --> 00:18:35.890
than fiction his life is.

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:38.040
I mean, he was a
slave trader, who

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.597
was then enslaved
and then became

00:18:39.597 --> 00:18:41.180
a leader of the
abolitionist movement.

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:42.300
CAROLYN ROSSI COPELAND:
And branded a slave.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:43.341
ERIN MACKEY: And branded.

00:18:43.341 --> 00:18:45.680
I mean, it's just incredible.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:49.000
So I knew nothing,
and then I've learned.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.870
CHARLES E. WALLACE: And being
with the show since 2009

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:53.499
when we did the first
reading, and when

00:18:53.499 --> 00:18:55.540
we had our first production
at Goodspeed in 2012,

00:18:55.540 --> 00:19:00.090
the director gave each of
us an assignment basically

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:02.480
that had something to
do with that period.

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.720
So once you've done that
research and you're like,

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.230
wow, all of this is happening.

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:10.640
So that's how a lot of
us have come to know

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:11.935
that period and John Newton.

00:19:11.935 --> 00:19:13.310
ERIN MACKEY: And
it takes place--

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:16.424
our story takes place in so many
different places in the world.

00:19:16.424 --> 00:19:17.590
It takes place Sierra Leone.

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:19.660
It takes place in
Barbados, in England.

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:23.250
So the research we did
was quite extensive.

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:25.250
ALAN SEALES: What was the
audition process like?

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:29.170
You mentioned that you just came
in blind, right, pretty much?

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:31.450
ERIN MACKEY: Well, my
story's kind of strange

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:33.130
because this isn't
how it normally goes.

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:36.335
I mean, I've auditioned
and I've been in many shows

00:19:36.335 --> 00:19:38.460
and you know, you usually
have to go several times.

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:40.626
This one just-- I think
really was just meant to be.

00:19:40.626 --> 00:19:44.449
I was out of town doing a
show and I was in California.

00:19:44.449 --> 00:19:45.990
I couldn't be there
for the audition.

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:49.580
So I put myself on tape, which I
think you did too, right, yeah?

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:53.024
Yeah, I put myself-- I videoed
myself singing some songs

00:19:53.024 --> 00:19:53.940
and doing some scenes.

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:55.740
And I know they had been
looking for a long time

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:56.620
and they were pretty--

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:58.036
CAROLYN ROSSI
COPELAND: I remember

00:19:58.036 --> 00:20:01.090
Pat McCorkle the casting agent
calling me and saying, well,

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:02.360
Erin Mackey can't come in.

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.234
You're going to have to
audition her on tape.

00:20:04.234 --> 00:20:08.690
And I said, there is no way
I'm hiring the lead actress

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:12.470
in our musical off of a tape!

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:14.530
ALAN SEALES: And here she sits.

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:14.850
CHARLES E. WALLACE:
Famous last words.

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:15.130
ALAN SEALES: Here she sits.

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:16.546
CAROLYN ROSSI
COPELAND: And then I

00:20:16.546 --> 00:20:19.440
watched the first 15 seconds
of her audition on tape

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:19.960
and I was--

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:20.600
ALAN SEALES: Done?

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:21.140
CAROLYN ROSSI
COPELAND: Oh my gosh.

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.630
ERIN MACKEY: Irene, thank you.

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:23.300
Off of a tape.

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:24.540
CAROLYN ROSSI COPELAND:
That's totally true.

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:25.440
That's totally true.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.100
ERIN MACKEY: And then I spoke
to the director on the phone,

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:29.607
and that's sort of just sealed
in all and I came on board.

00:20:29.607 --> 00:20:30.690
So that was my experience.

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:31.220
CAROLYN ROSSI
COPELAND: But, Laiona,

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:32.920
you've been with us
since the beginning too.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.295
LAIONA MICHELLE:
Yeah, yeah, it's

00:20:34.295 --> 00:20:37.520
been six years from
the very first reading.

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.040
And before then I
was doing just a lot

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:43.314
of new plays, a lot of new
workshops, many of which

00:20:43.314 --> 00:20:44.730
continue without
me because that's

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:47.340
just how the business goes.

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:49.440
But this one really
fell on my lap.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:51.730
And it was like a blessing
to walk in the room,

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:56.210
to not know anything about
this story of "Amazing Grace,"

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:57.900
and to just go in there.

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:00.830
And it was a monologue,
I believe, at the time.

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:03.414
And then the role grow
into a principal role

00:21:03.414 --> 00:21:04.330
with a beautiful song.

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:07.304
How lucky am I to get to
sing such wonderful material

00:21:07.304 --> 00:21:07.970
like "Daybreak?"

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:09.300
ERIN MACKEY: I just get
to listen to it on stage

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:09.970
every night.

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:10.670
ALAN SEALES: That was amazing.

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:11.450
Yeah.

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:14.440
Yeah that was one of the
two parts where I cried.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.280
When you did your
number I was like--

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:17.380

about the end of the first act?

Was that amazing?

Yes.

Eugene Lee-- one of the
prolific set designers

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:33.980
in this country "Wicked,"
on and on and on-- he

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:35.870
created something at
the end of the act

amazing So going back like six

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:44.370
years though, both of
you, Charles and Laiona,

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:47.430
you guys have been with it
from-- since what initial--

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:48.842
like, you've got a script and--

00:21:48.842 --> 00:21:50.550
CHARLES E. WALLACE:
Since the first read.

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:53.330
CAROLYN ROSSI COPELAND: I
wouldn't even call it a script.

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:54.670
We had a couple of ideas.

ALAN SEALES: And, Carolyn,
you were involved,

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:57.250
you were with it the
whole way too, right?

00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:58.630
CAROLYN ROSSI COPELAND: Yeah.

00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:00.165
ALAN SEALES: So-- go ahead.

00:22:00.165 --> 00:22:01.340

what was your question.

ALAN SEALES: Oh,
I was going to ask

00:22:02.798 --> 00:22:04.842
Carolyn what an executive
producer does, but I--

00:22:04.842 --> 00:22:06.550
CAROLYN ROSSI COPELAND:
I mean, first you

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:09.240
have to find the material
you want to work on

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:10.844
and then you have
to raise the money.

00:22:10.844 --> 00:22:11.510
ALAN SEALES: Oh.

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:12.980
CAROLYN ROSSI COPELAND:
It's a very expensive show.

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:13.310
I'm sure you can see that.

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:13.820
ALAN SEALES: Oh, I bet.

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:14.590
I bet, yeah.

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:16.050
CAROLYN ROSSI COPELAND: There's
30 something people on it.

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:17.350
It's a very, very
expensive show.

ALAN SEALES: The Nederlander is
not cheap real estate either.

00:22:19.891 --> 00:22:20.520
Yeah.

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:22.420
CAROLYN ROSSI COPELAND: So
you have to find the property.

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:23.750
You have to develop
the property.

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:25.630
You've got to go and
try it out a few places.

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:27.340
We went to Goodspeed
Opera House.

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:30.190
Then we went to Chicago, to
the Bank of America Theater.

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:32.960
And then we came and waited
for a theater in New York.

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.740
And in the meantime you
have to keep raising money,

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:36.590
raising money.

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:39.730
And we were fortunate
enough to have raised

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:41.350
enough to open on Broadway.

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:44.560
So, you know, the
next step for this

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:47.020
is hopefully to have a long run.

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:48.592
ALAN SEALES: So
what happens though.

00:22:48.592 --> 00:22:50.550
Like, can you get to a
point where you're like,

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:52.080
oh, we're this close, we're
this close to Broadway

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.325
and then you just don't get
money and it just goes away?

00:22:54.325 --> 00:22:55.260
CAROLYN ROSSI COPELAND:
Yeah, lots of shows.

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:56.230
Most shows.

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:57.570
ERIN MACKEY: Yeah, that
happens to most shows.

00:22:57.570 --> 00:22:57.625
CAROLYN ROSSI COPELAND:
You've probably

00:22:57.625 --> 00:22:59.060
been involved in lots of those.

00:22:59.060 --> 00:22:59.810
Yeah.

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:01.685
VINCE ODDO: And it's
not only just the money,

00:23:01.685 --> 00:23:04.141
it's to the actual space.

00:23:04.141 --> 00:23:06.640
I mean, we were waiting around
for a theater for the longest

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:06.940
time.

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:08.820
People were like, well, I
don't know about this show.

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:09.820
I don't know about this.

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:12.170
Everyone's like,
well-- they think they

00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:14.210
want the next biggest thing.

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:15.520
They're willing to do whatever.

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:19.100
Or there's months in advance
where people have already

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:20.086
had theaters booked.

00:23:20.086 --> 00:23:22.460
So we were just kind of like,
when is it going to happen?

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:24.959
CAROLYN ROSSI COPELAND: If you
have a show that was a movie,

00:23:24.959 --> 00:23:26.040

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:29.530
Well, "Newsies" happened
to be wonderful.

00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:30.100
ALAN SEALES: It was very good.

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:31.475
CAROLYN ROSSI
COPELAND: It's just

00:23:31.475 --> 00:23:33.600
there's so many
movie musicals now

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.910
people think, oh well, you've
got a built in audience.

00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:37.845
But in our show,
you actually don't

00:23:37.845 --> 00:23:40.345
know how it's going to end when
you walk in the door, right?

00:23:40.345 --> 00:23:40.620
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:41.610
CAROLYN ROSSI COPELAND:
So you're like this.

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:43.630
And you're really
engaged because you don't

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:45.300
know how it's going to end.

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:46.890
And I think that's
more interesting.

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:49.340
ERIN MACKEY: Yeah, it's what
people who I've had come

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:51.064
see the show are
just so-- they just

00:23:51.064 --> 00:23:52.480
don't know what's
going to happen.

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:53.570
And that's fascinating.

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:57.680
And it's just kind of becoming
rarer on the Broadway stage--

00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.694
to see something that
is truly unknown.

00:23:59.694 --> 00:24:01.110
CHARLES E. WALLACE:
Original, yes.

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:01.260
ERIN MACKEY: Original.

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:03.093
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, this
is totally original.

00:24:03.093 --> 00:24:05.750
And the music is-- it's
got that classic feel.

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:08.177
It's got that-- it's
got that "Les Mis" feel,

00:24:08.177 --> 00:24:09.260
for lack of anything else.

00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:11.479
And it is that
something personally

00:24:11.479 --> 00:24:12.770
that drew you guys to the show?

00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:17.430
Or was it a conscious
decision on the--

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:19.280
from the writer and
the composer to make

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:22.160
it sound a little bit
older because it's

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.494
set in 1744, right?

00:24:23.494 --> 00:24:25.910
CAROLYN ROSSI COPELAND: Well,
the first thing that I heard

00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:28.840
was a website-- I
went to a concert

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:31.170
in the basement of the
Empire State Building,

00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:32.970
and there were like
about 10 songs.

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:37.330
And I think only a couple of
them are still in the show.

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:40.510
But the three that
I fell in love with,

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:42.450
I went back to my
office-- because I've

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:44.400
been producing theater
for a long time--

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:47.500
and I got on the website and I
sent them to three friends who

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:51.070
are dead hard commercial
theater people, and I said,

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:52.720
what do you think
of these songs?

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:57.230
And they emailed me back,
goosebumps, goosebumps.

00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:59.060
And I was like, OK,
so I think we've

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:01.470
got the beginnings of
something really great here.

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:04.930
You know, when a piece of
music can move you that way.

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:07.190
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, I'm
still singing the finale,

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:08.160
the song you guys sang.

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:10.427

have been dropped.

oh right, no, it

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.515
was the character of Nanna
was not a principal character

00:25:27.515 --> 00:25:28.090
at first.

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:29.410
Like, how has the show grown?

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:30.630
What's different?

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:32.510
LAIONA MICHELLE: Ah, let's see.

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:34.770
It's grown so much.

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:38.670
I will say this, that we say
all the time that theatre is

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:42.280
a collaborative art, and it
really, really, really is.

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.710
This room just from
the rehearsal process

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:46.500
has been so open.

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:49.660
We have been in a room
where the writers were

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:55.200
able to let the artists, the
actors, play so much and improv

00:25:55.200 --> 00:26:00.960
and help flesh out the scenes
and inspire the dialogue.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:04.080
And I have never had an
experience like that.

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:06.010
All the way up to
previews we had maybe

00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:09.910
about 20 pages per day
of just massive changes.

00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:13.880
And they have really
just been open to us

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:16.190
in the entire process.

00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:16.690
Yeah.

00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:19.740
So a lot, a tremendous
amount has changed.

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:22.010
ERIN MACKEY: Even-- even
just from Chicago to here,

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:25.440
which is only a matter of
what was it, six months?

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:25.960
Yeah.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:27.390
And a lot of the
show did change.

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:29.190
We learned a lot
in Chicago, learned

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:33.260
about the structure of it and
how the audience follows it.

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:35.810
I think all the
characters became--

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:40.150
just were deepened in
terms of the-- yeah,

00:26:42.925 --> 00:26:45.200
about a musical, on any
musical that you work on--

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.980
and I've worked on a lot of
musicals-- the composer ends up

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:50.890
with a trunk full of songs
that he's thrown out.

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:54.200
And they become the
inspiration for the next work.

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.700
Because we've probably
thrown out eight to 10,

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.710
12 songs in the process.

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:00.840

CAROLYN ROSSI COPELAND:
But we've replaced some.

of songs that the sailors sang.

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:29.990
ALAN SEALES: So the
show is set in 1744

00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:32.220
at the height of the
British slave trade.

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:33.940
And of course, like,
the two main topics

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:36.310
of the show-- in case you
guys didn't pick up on it--

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:41.580
are slavery and racism, which
are two very big topics still

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:44.980
today that people are
uncomfortable talking about.

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:48.190
I mean going into the
readings and the rehearsals

00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:50.300
were-- I guess, you as
a producer or you guys

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:53.240
as actors-- were any of you
worried about any backlash

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:56.610
or anything negative that may
come out of it from an audience

00:27:56.610 --> 00:27:59.220
perspective?

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:02.230
VINCE ODDO: I think
our job as actors

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:04.830
is to tell the
story to its most--

00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:07.350
to the umpteenth
version of truth.

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:11.860
And, you know, if that is a hot
button thing for some people--

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:14.340
our job is to tell it with
the most truths possible.

00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:17.610
And if that is uncomfortable
for some people, that's fine.

00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:19.150
That's the reason we do things.

00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:20.650
ERIN MACKEY: That's
part of theater.

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:21.080
VINCE ODDO: Yeah.

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:21.390
Yeah.

00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:22.620
And the reason why we create.

00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:26.170
And if you could move some
people to feel some things,

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:27.800
that is the reason we do this.

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.630
So yes, it's uncomfortable.

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:35.340
And race and racism is obviously
very prevalent today with

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:38.560
what's been happening, but
that is--that's our job,

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:41.580
to move people to feel things,
to inspire conversations like

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:42.200
this one.

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:42.908
ALAN SEALES: Mhm.

00:28:42.908 --> 00:28:45.560
CHARLES E. WALLACE: And, during
the process while working

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:48.530
on the show when,
say for instance, we

00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:52.570
got to a particular scene when
they brought the slaves out

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:56.130
to be sold, it was a bit
uncomfortable in the room

00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:59.620
because you're not used to
dealing with that every day.

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:04.120
But the director and the
artistic staff, everybody

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:07.060
made it-- it was a
safe place in the room

00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:09.490
so you could talk
about those issues.

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:13.750
And then at the end
of the day, yes, it

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:16.920
is our job to tell the story.

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:22.190
But if once you know that
you are in a safe place

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:26.720
and everybody in this room-- we
all have the same goal in mind,

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:29.700
then you go on about
your business as an actor

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:31.582
and you do the job
and tell the story.

00:29:31.582 --> 00:29:33.790
CAROLYN ROSSI COPELAND: And
our Director, Gabe Barre,

00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:37.220
is the most gracious human
being on the face of the earth.

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:42.020
He is kind and patient
and never raised his voice

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:46.010
or had any kind of artistic
flair up in the room.

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:51.370
So he was-- really created
the space for the conversation

00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:52.890
between the actors.

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:56.220
And now the actors have created
the ability for the audiences

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:57.290
to have the conversation.

00:29:57.290 --> 00:29:59.890
And I can tell you,
on any given night

00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:02.260
you can show up at the theater.

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:05.590
It's a very diverse audience
and people are crying.

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:07.860
And people are
speaking to each other.

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:11.010
And it is really
a perfect moment

00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:12.400
in time for this musical.

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.660
We didn't plan it
that way, it's one

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:17.620
of those divine
interventions that our show

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:19.420
has opened at this
period in time

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:21.820
when people really need
to have this conversation.

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:24.630
I can't believe we're in 2015
and we're still saying this,

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:26.510
but we are.

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:28.210
ALAN SEALES: So,
have you-- has there

00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:31.090
been anything bad from critics
or audience members that

00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:32.290
have come in at all?

00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:34.370
Do you get hate mail?

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:34.870
I mean--

00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:36.453
CAROLYN ROSSI COPELAND:
Not hate mail.

00:30:36.453 --> 00:30:38.670
ERIN MACKEY: I haven't
gotten any hate mail.

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:40.669
VINCE ODDO: At the stage
door every night people

00:30:40.669 --> 00:30:42.084
are just so inspired.

00:30:42.084 --> 00:30:44.250
I think that's what it
always comes down at the end.

00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:47.200
No one's is disagreeing with
anything that's happening,

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.190
they're just moved in a way.

00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:52.530
And that's-- we've done exactly
what we sought out to do is

00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:54.420
move these people in
a way that's like,

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:56.340
oh my goodness this
really happened.

00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:56.930
CAROLYN ROSSI COPELAND: Yeah.

00:30:56.930 --> 00:30:59.080
VINCE ODDO: How can I look
at myself in the mirror

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:00.240
and do better?

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:02.140
Just generally do better.

00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:03.860
That's kind of my, how I've--

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:05.068
CAROLYN ROSSI COPELAND: Yeah.

00:31:05.068 --> 00:31:06.970
I think some of the New
York cynical critics

00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:10.820
can't really embrace the fact
that people are feeling things.

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:13.300
But isn't that why
you go to the theater?

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:14.860
Don't you want to
feel something?

00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:16.870
I mean, it's an
expensive ticket.

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:19.410
I hope you want to do more
than just be entertained.

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:21.980
And this is very
entertaining, but it also

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:23.137
makes you feel something.

00:31:23.137 --> 00:31:24.470
ERIN MACKEY: It makes you think.

00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:26.803
CAROLYN ROSSI COPELAND: Yeah,
it makes you really think.

00:31:26.803 --> 00:31:30.030
But you will also leave
having had a great experience.

00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:34.240
But one of the critics
from some offshoot magazine

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:37.120
said that we planted
people to stand.

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:39.030
And I can tell you
that every night--

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:39.860
ALAN SEALES: During
the curtin call?

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:40.550
CAROLYN ROSSI COPELAND: Yeah.

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:41.900
I mean is that possible?

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:42.701
You were there.

00:31:42.701 --> 00:31:43.450
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:45.030
CAROLYN ROSSI COPELAND: People
just jump to their feet.

00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:46.221
It happens every night.

00:31:46.221 --> 00:31:47.470
They just couldn't believe it.

00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:50.067
They didn't want to
believe that it happens.

00:31:50.067 --> 00:31:50.900
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:51.994
LAIONA MICHELLE: I know for me--

00:31:51.994 --> 00:31:52.398
CHARLES E. WALLACE:
Raise their hands

00:31:52.398 --> 00:31:53.610
ALAN SEALES: There's
a lot of feelings.

00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:54.090
CHARLES E. WALLACE:
They touch people

00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:56.540
they don't even
know next to them.

00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:57.240
It's amazing.

00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.600
CAROLYN ROSSI COPELAND: But
you can be alone if you want.

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:00.140
You know, if you want
your private space.

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:01.730
CHARLES E. WALLACE:
But it's amazing.

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:02.350
ALAN SEALES: Yeah,
because you do

00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:05.210
sort of an audience sing-along,
I guess, with "Amazing Grace."

00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:07.335
CAROLYN ROSSI COPELAND: We
didn't plan it that way,

00:32:07.335 --> 00:32:09.850
but in Chicago when it
happened we were like, wow.

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:12.206
And then I said to our
director and writer,

00:32:12.206 --> 00:32:13.580
I said, maybe when
we come to New

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:15.420
York we need to revisit this.

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:18.640
Let's, like, put it on
hold and see what happens.

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:21.790
And so we watched and the first
couple of nights, same thing.

00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:22.780
We're like, OK, go.

00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:24.530
ALAN SEALES: Yeah,
people like singing it.

00:32:24.530 --> 00:32:26.238
ERIN MACKEY: Well,
there are so few songs

00:32:26.238 --> 00:32:29.229
that-- it used to be such a
cultural thing in society--

00:32:29.229 --> 00:32:30.770
everyone kind of
knew the same songs.

00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:32.900
It was something that
you did together,

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:34.900
but that's phased out so much.

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:37.110
But it's "Happy Birthday"
and "Amazing Grace."

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:39.240
I mean people-- those
are the songs we know.

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:40.270
And so it's exciting.

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:44.080
You're like, I know this
song, and I'm feeling so much.

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:46.927
Like, I can sing it!

00:32:46.927 --> 00:32:48.010
ALAN SEALES: That's funny.

00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:49.940
So audience, if you
guys have any questions,

00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:53.450
there's two mics in the
aisles for you to ask.

00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:55.110
Feel free to come up any time.

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:59.370
So, Vince, John Newton,
I would like to play him,

00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:01.882
do I need big biceps?

00:33:01.882 --> 00:33:03.840
VINCE ODDO: No, that's
not correct [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:04.310
No, not at all.

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:05.893
ERIN MACKEY: But
it's not a bad trait.

00:33:08.645 --> 00:33:10.770
ALAN SEALES: How demanding
is the role John Newton?

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:11.950
Like, he's in every scene.

00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:12.950
He's all over the place.

00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:14.890
He's like getting
tied up or beaten

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:17.450
or jumping around or, yeah.

00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:20.920
VINCE ODDO: I've always
approached the theater business

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:24.430
or acting business in the way
that you would kind of-- I'm

00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:26.530
from a big sports background.

00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:27.302
And--

00:33:27.302 --> 00:33:29.010
ALAN SEALES: (DEEP
VOICE) Obviously, yes.

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:31.700
VINCE ODDO: If you
can't tell all ready.

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:32.940
No, but it's true.

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:34.720
You have to-- you
have to have your body

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.970
and be mentally
sharp at all times.

00:33:36.970 --> 00:33:38.930
And that's for-- and
I think for anything

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:41.580
that you-- that I personally
want to be successful for,

00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:44.020
I just want to be at my best.

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:45.530
The role of John
Newton is a lot.

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:47.390
It's vocally tiring, one.

00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:49.130
As well as physically tiring.

00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:50.480
You're getting beat.

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:55.580
You're getting-- there's all
sorts of explosions, fights.

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:58.420
So you have to be
in as best shape

00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:00.560
as you personally
can, and I feel

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:02.760
the most comfortable
being in the shape

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:04.900
that I'm in for any show.

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:06.400
Doesn't have to be this one.

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:07.300
Or, but--

00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:08.883
CAROLYN ROSSI COPELAND:
Vince was also

00:34:08.883 --> 00:34:11.845
in "Rocky," so thus the biceps.

00:34:11.845 --> 00:34:12.719
ALAN SEALES: Ah, OK.

00:34:12.719 --> 00:34:14.544
It all comes full circle now.

00:34:14.544 --> 00:34:16.210
What have you enjoyed
about playing John

00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:18.650
Newton versus other characters?

00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:23.330
VINCE ODDO: Um,
he's a terrible guy.

00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:27.639
In the beginning of the play
it's-- the arrogance and flair

00:34:27.639 --> 00:34:31.600
that you could have being
someone is just-- I'm not--

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:34.340
I'm totally not John
Newton in my normal life,

00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:38.630
so to be able to do that--
to do the role and just have

00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:42.489
a humongous transformation
going from Act One to Act Two.

00:34:42.489 --> 00:34:46.100
And seeing what you've
done in the past-- how

00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:49.730
ever many years in
the play it is-- just

00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:52.020
having that reconciliation
with oneself

00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:54.489
and the redemption
that he goes through.

00:34:54.489 --> 00:34:56.489
He's the most difficult
person I've ever played.

00:34:56.489 --> 00:35:00.550
And it's-- I think there's so
much beauty in the fact that

00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:04.990
there's this man who was so
wretched and awful who comes

00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:10.340
literally full circle to
help start the abolitionist

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:10.840
movement.

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:14.040
You know, someone who is
the son of a slave trader.

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:16.890
And it's just a very
complicated person.

00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:19.470
As an actor it's like
I felt-- you've like

00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:21.150
fallen in a gold mine.

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:23.290
Of course you want to
do something that moves

00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:24.530
people in some sort of way.

00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:27.332
And I think that's who John
Newton is, and it's fun.

00:35:27.332 --> 00:35:28.040
ALAN SEALES: Huh.

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:28.540
Yeah.

00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:29.740
Question.

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:31.760
AUDIENCE: Yes, thank you
for coming to Google,

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:33.980
and thank you for that
excellent performance.

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:35.360
I really want to see the play.

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:35.860
CAST: Yay!

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:36.355
Great!

00:35:36.355 --> 00:35:36.855
Good!

00:35:36.855 --> 00:35:39.330
ERIN MACKEY: Come see the play!

00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:42.550
AUDIENCE: And then, you've
already answered my question.

00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:45.710
But I'm curious for
the other actors, what

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:47.350
types of roles or
characters have

00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:49.890
you played in the past
which prepared you

00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:52.540
for the roll you're
currently playing?

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:55.140
Just for people who haven't
seen the musical yet,

00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:58.330
sort of-- like what are
similar characters to those

00:35:58.330 --> 00:35:59.770
you're currently playing?

00:35:59.770 --> 00:36:03.400
ERIN MACKEY: I have to say that
before we did the production

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:05.530
in Chicago, I had done
"South Pacific" at two

00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:09.530
different theaters last
year and I played Nellie.

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:14.170
And a huge-- I mean, the end
of Act One of "South Pacific"

00:36:14.170 --> 00:36:18.300
is it being revealed
that Nellie is racist.

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:20.230
That she has been
taught certain things.

00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:23.380
She grew up in Little Rock,
Arkansas, and it's 1940s

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:29.960
and she does not
see the Polynesians

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:33.260
that she meets in the South
Pacific as bean equals.

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:39.060
And and it's a very dark
place to go as an actor,

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:44.300
but it was very helpful to me
as I started this because that

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:46.620
is where these people are.

00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:48.680
Mary begins there.

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:49.490
John begins there.

00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:53.110
They do not believe that
these people are equals.

00:36:53.110 --> 00:36:57.260
And that is the realization
they make, thank god.

00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:59.560
You know, but for
me that was very

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:03.426
helpful-- was to have kind of
stepped in those shoes before.

00:37:03.426 --> 00:37:05.050
Different, very
different circumstances

00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:07.350
but similar human issues.

00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:09.955
So for me that was helpful.

00:37:09.955 --> 00:37:12.455
LAIONA MICHELLE: Yeah, I feel
like the majority of my career

00:37:12.455 --> 00:37:15.770
I've been leading up to
playing this role of Nanna

00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:17.440
that I based off
of my grandmother.

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:21.940
I've played a number of maids
and slaves throughout my life.

00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:25.190
But I also had the opportunity
to play Ida B. Wells who

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:27.890
was a trailblazer in the civil
rights movement who started

00:37:27.890 --> 00:37:29.920
the anti-lynching campaign.

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:34.700
So the spirit of Ida B. Wells
fused with my grandmother, who

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:39.470
worked as a maid for the
majority of her adult life,

00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:42.350
really prepared
me for this role.

00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:44.890
Yeah, to give a voice
to all the Nannas

00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:48.640
out in the world that
don't have the voice

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:51.480
CHARLES E. WALLACE: I think
whether it's playing this role

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:54.330
or-- I did John
in "Miss Saigon"--

00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:58.750
or any other role is first
and foremost is staying up

00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:00.860
on your craft.

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:04.290
You know, it's continuing
to work on your voice, voice

00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:08.900
lessons, maybe acting class here
and there, physical movement.

00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:13.470
And then after
that, this story--

00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:16.160
this play being based
on a true story,

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:20.250
as was "Saigon," for
some reason for me when

00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:23.320
there's real truth
there basically--

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:25.850
and you've done the research
as the director had us

00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:32.790
do-- then you just take all that
information and you go with it.

00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:36.960
So that that's what works
for me is the research

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:39.290
and basically staying
up on your craft.

00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:41.540
ALAN SEALES: What kind of--
you mentioned the research

00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:42.990
earlier too.

00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:45.890
What kind of research
did the director

00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:48.600
have you do to
prepare for the show?

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:50.730
I mean, you just went
off and picked something

00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:51.660
to learn about?

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:52.020
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:53.894
ERIN MACKEY: He actually
gave us assignments,

00:38:53.894 --> 00:38:56.300
we got stuff like
homework assignments

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:57.700
for the first day of rehearsal.

00:38:57.700 --> 00:38:58.100
CHARLES E. WALLACE: There
were like 30 assignments

00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:00.530
so you got to hear everyone.

00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:02.250
VINCE ODDO: Two full
days of rehearsal.

00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:05.940
ERIN MACKEY: Everything
from authentic-- the dance

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:09.052
of the period in
and Sierra Leone.

00:39:09.052 --> 00:39:10.510
The dance of the
period in England.

00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:11.366
The--

00:39:11.366 --> 00:39:12.562
DAN: Christmas celebrations.

00:39:12.562 --> 00:39:14.520
ERIN MACKEY: Christmas
celebrations in England.

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:15.130
DAN: Cricket.

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:16.384
ERIN MACKEY: Sports.

00:39:16.384 --> 00:39:18.300
VINCE ODDO: How many
sailors were on the ship.

00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:18.360
ERIN MACKEY: The Navy.

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:19.960
VINCE ODDO: Their
living quarters.

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:20.460
There's--

00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:21.251
ERIN MACKEY: A war.

00:39:21.251 --> 00:39:26.670
VINCE ODDO: --32, 33
different assignments.

00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:29.190
And we spent two days,
eight hours a day

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:31.560
just sitting in a
huge room learning

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:34.020
so much about each other
and homework assignments.

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:34.770
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:36.040
Question.

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:39.620
AUDIENCE: Is the entire
play set in 1744 or does it

00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:41.455
cover some of the later
periods of his life?

00:39:41.455 --> 00:39:43.330
CAROLYN ROSSI COPELAND:
We compress his story

00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:44.630
into two years.

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:47.400
Because truly John Newton
didn't write "Amazing Grace"

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:49.270
until much later in his life.

00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:53.200
So we sort of compresses
his life into two years.

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:57.900
So historically not exactly
accurate, because that fight

00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:58.880
took 20 years.

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:00.820
AUDIENCE: Well it
took until what?

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:02.910
1840s and Wilberforce
helping to finish--

00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:04.740
CAROLYN ROSSI COPELAND: Well,
he was William Wilberforce's

00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:05.240
mentor.

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:05.620
AUDIENCE: I knew that.

00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:06.000
CAROLYN ROSSI COPELAND: Yeah.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:06.540
Yeah.

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:07.680
AUDIENCE: The other
question is, when

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:09.435
you were thinking
about this, did you--

00:40:09.435 --> 00:40:12.285
you reminded me of another play
with another nasty slave trader

00:40:12.285 --> 00:40:13.750
who converts in "The Mission."

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:15.236
Did you think at all about that?

00:40:15.236 --> 00:40:17.610
CAROLYN ROSSI COPELAND: No,
but that's a beautiful movie.

00:40:17.610 --> 00:40:20.230
It's a gorgeous movie
with a gorgeous score.

00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:23.030
Really beautiful.

00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:23.930
ALAN SEALES: So Erin,

00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:24.140
ERIN MACKEY: Yeah.

00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:25.680
ALAN SEALES: Along with-- hi.

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:26.850
ERIN MACKEY: Hi.

00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:28.594
ALAN SEALES: Along
with the other topics

00:40:28.594 --> 00:40:30.260
that of course we've
been talking about,

00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:34.240
the role Mary Catlett is
that of a strong woman

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:37.610
in a time when women were
not supposed to be that way.

00:40:37.610 --> 00:40:42.040
So, how did you find this
proper balance of being

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:45.040
the demur single woman
which, of course being

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.540
single at an older--
and I know even

00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:48.331
know how old she's
supposed to be actually.

00:40:48.331 --> 00:40:50.500
ERIN MACKEY: In the show
she's about-- she's 18, 19.

00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:51.860
I mean, she's like prime time--

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:52.370
ALAN SEALES: Oh yeah.

00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:52.680
ERIN MACKEY: for
getting married.

00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:54.835
ALAN SEALES: It's like
very marrying age, right?

00:40:54.835 --> 00:40:55.734
ERIN MACKEY: Yeah.

00:40:55.734 --> 00:40:57.900
ALAN SEALES: So was that
difficult to find a balance

00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:01.010
between being what-- playing
a character that people were

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:06.720
supposed to expect a certain
way versus actually, like,

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:07.930
finding inner strength--

00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:08.265
ERIN MACKEY: Absolutely.

00:41:08.265 --> 00:41:09.240
ALAN SEALES: --for
this character?

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:11.656
ERIN MACKEY: That's what's
been probably my favorite thing

00:41:11.656 --> 00:41:13.370
about Marry and
playing her is the fact

00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:15.430
that she is so
progressive at a time

00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:18.620
where she had no rights, really.

00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:20.060
I mean, she didn't.

00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:24.050
And she's speaking up for
people who have no voice,

00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:27.420
and she has no power.

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:31.080
I mean, she's finding ways
to assert power in a society

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:33.760
that she does not
have many ways.

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:35.610
And she's willing to die for it.

00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:39.690
I mean, it's-- yeah it's
definitely-- you know,

00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:41.310
she's working
within her society.

00:41:41.310 --> 00:41:42.810
She's working within
her conditions.

00:41:42.810 --> 00:41:49.247
So she's-- I mean, she's kind
of playing the game sometimes.

00:41:49.247 --> 00:41:51.080
But she's trying to use
it to her advantage,

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:55.392
and use it to make a
difference in her society.

00:41:55.392 --> 00:41:56.850
So that's one of
my favorite things

00:41:56.850 --> 00:42:00.050
about Mary is that-- what you
just said-- is that obstacle,

00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:04.660
is that just back and forth
for her and that struggle.

00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:08.690
And that she-- and that
she decides that, I

00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:10.500
know what I'm supposed to do.

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:14.280
I know what society tells me
to do, but it's not right.

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:17.820
And I can't stand
for it anymore.

00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:22.060
ALAN SEALES: Even against advice
from your Nanna who was like,

00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:22.920
don't-- don't do it.

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:23.754
Don't rock the boat.

00:42:23.754 --> 00:42:24.753
Like, everything's good.

00:42:24.753 --> 00:42:25.380
Yeah.

00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:26.400
Don't get involved.

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:27.125
Yeah.

00:42:27.125 --> 00:42:27.450
ERIN MACKEY: Absolutely.

00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:28.616
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, question.

00:42:28.616 --> 00:42:29.216
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:42:29.216 --> 00:42:30.090
Thank you for coming.

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:33.000
I'm a big Broadway fan.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.080
So my question is, what
is something, like,

00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:38.790
memorable or profound that
someone has said to you

00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:40.507
at stage door or something.

00:42:40.507 --> 00:42:41.590
ALAN SEALES: Oh, good one.

00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:43.760
CAROLYN ROSSI COPELAND:
That's a good question.

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:46.080
CHARLES E. WALLACE: Real
recently-- before someone else

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:49.870
takes this-- the
other day there was

00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:55.340
a woman from Sierra Leone
who was at the show,

00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:59.230
and part of our show is
based in Sierra Leone.

00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:03.890
And her name was Yema, as is one
of the characters in the show.

00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:08.680
So when things like that happen,
it's-- like that happened.

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:10.939
And then the other-- on
Sunday afternoon a lot

00:43:10.939 --> 00:43:13.230
of times when we're singing
the last chorus of "Amazing

00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:17.600
Grace" and people just one
at the time get up and start,

00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:20.840
and it makes you
cry onstage-- those

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:22.929
are some of the most
memorable moments for me.

00:43:22.929 --> 00:43:24.720
LAIONA MICHELLE: I
think the most memorable

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:27.940
for me was having a
conversation with my nephew

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:31.190
who just completed his first
year at Hampton University.

00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:33.640
So he comes-- and he's
staying with me for summer.

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:36.270
And he, you know, he
was at opening night,

00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:39.650
and we had a conversation
the next morning.

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:42.115
And I said, so, Jay, what
did you think about the show?

00:43:42.115 --> 00:43:45.400
And he was like, Auntie,
to be honest with you,

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:48.910
I am still processing.

00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:50.160
That was a lot of information.

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:53.970
I was deeply moved, and
I'm still processing.

00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:55.210
It shook me.

00:43:55.210 --> 00:43:56.180
It shook me.

00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:59.390
And I thought it was beautiful
that he articulated that,

00:43:59.390 --> 00:44:00.900
and that he is processing.

00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:02.770
And I think that's the
point of this show.

00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:05.110
You know, theater
has to be reachable.

00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:07.545
And it's not going to
always be comfortable.

00:44:07.545 --> 00:44:10.800
I'm extremely uncomfortable
playing this role,

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:13.800
but I know that's what I'm
supposed to be in order

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:16.599
for this piece of art to reach.

00:44:16.599 --> 00:44:18.890
CAROLYN ROSSI COPELAND: I've
produce a lot of musicals,

00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:20.490
but I've never
produced a musical

00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:22.640
where people will come up
to you and say, thank you

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:23.520
for doing this.

00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:27.160
It was almost like a movement
or something, you know?

00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:31.140
Thank you for stepping out
and-- I mean it's a high risk.

00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:37.640
You are in the business
of following trends

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:41.680
and, you know, we're bucking a
big trend and it's a high risk,

00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:44.280
but it's really a valuable risk.

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:47.110
And I think the appreciation
from the audience

00:44:47.110 --> 00:44:51.510
to the actors, as well to
me, has been so unusual.

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:52.740
ALAN SEALES: Hmm.

00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:55.610
So, Laiona, congrats on your
Broadway debut, by the way.

00:44:55.610 --> 00:44:56.240
Yeah?

00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:56.990
[CHEERING]

00:44:56.990 --> 00:44:57.740
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:00.114
Wonderful.

00:45:00.114 --> 00:45:02.530
So you mentioned-- you mentioned
that your character makes

00:45:02.530 --> 00:45:05.090
you feel uncomfortable, which
is, I guess a good thing,

00:45:05.090 --> 00:45:07.735
but-- like all of you-- I
guess this question goes out

00:45:07.735 --> 00:45:13.640
for all of you-- that you have
to do this powerful, emotional

00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:17.220
heartbreak-- bring yourself
into this heartbreak eight times

00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:18.680
a week.

00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:21.824
Like, is that difficult
for you to go through this?

00:45:21.824 --> 00:45:23.740
I mean, like, is seeing--
the show I watched--

00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:25.865
it was one show, and I felt
like you put everything

00:45:25.865 --> 00:45:27.450
you had into this one moment!

00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:28.783
CAROLYN ROSSI COPELAND: They do.

00:45:28.783 --> 00:45:29.570
They really do.

00:45:29.570 --> 00:45:32.430
ALAN SEALES: I mean, like how--

00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:34.740
ERIN MACKEY: I watch a lot
of really crappy reality TV

00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:36.140
to just like totally turn off.

00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:37.640
CAROLYN ROSSI
COPELAND: Yes, you do.

00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:40.010
ERIN MACKEY: Like you can
totally separate for a while.

00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:41.510
I'm like, all right,
give me some--

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:42.301
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:45:42.301 --> 00:45:45.620
CAROLYN ROSSI COPELAND: A lot
of "Bachelorette" going on.

00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:48.180
Which is over.

00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:49.346
ERIN MACKEY: Don't spoil it.

00:45:49.346 --> 00:45:50.760
I haven't watched it yet.

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:52.636
VINCE ODDO: I don't
watch "The Bachelorette."

00:45:52.636 --> 00:45:54.259
ERIN MACKEY: But, I
mean, yeah, you do.

00:45:54.259 --> 00:45:55.510
You do-- you just have to.

00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:56.676
It's part of being an actor.

00:45:56.676 --> 00:45:59.469
It's part of doing many
shows, and this is definitely

00:45:59.469 --> 00:46:00.260
one of them where--

00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:02.468
CAROLYN ROSSI COPELAND:
Their whole weekend-- Friday,

00:46:02.468 --> 00:46:05.320
two Saturday, one Sunday,
it's kind of-- Sunday night

00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:06.550
is a wipe-out.

00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:09.240
And then Monday
is a re-grouping.

00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:10.300
And then here's Tuesday.

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:13.380
And they start tonight and
go through next Sunday.

00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:14.410
It's a heavy job.

00:46:14.410 --> 00:46:15.350
It's heavy lifting.

00:46:15.350 --> 00:46:16.280
Eight times a week.

00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:18.786
VINCE ODDO: It-- I
mean, it is a heavy job,

00:46:18.786 --> 00:46:20.160
but I think the
other thing, too,

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:22.200
is we all got into
this for a reason.

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:26.360
And the fact, like, for me
personally I-- you know,

00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:28.624
you work so hard
to get to Broadway

00:46:28.624 --> 00:46:29.790
because that's the pinnacle.

00:46:29.790 --> 00:46:31.010
It's the top.

00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:32.780
And once you're
there you just want

00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:35.310
to make the most of the
fact that you're there.

00:46:35.310 --> 00:46:39.320
And we're so privileged to
have to do eight shows week.

00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:43.226
You know, I've also
shoveled for 12 hours a day,

00:46:43.226 --> 00:46:46.640
and I really like
doing plays instead.

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:49.470
ALAN SEALES: Should I ask
what you were shoveling?

00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:51.830
VINCE ODDO: I worked
construction, so it was like--

00:46:51.830 --> 00:46:53.220
ALAN SEALES: So
literally shoveling shit

00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:54.595
or metaphorically
shoveling shit.

00:46:54.595 --> 00:46:57.840
VINCE ODDO: Yeah,
yeah, the-- both.

00:46:57.840 --> 00:46:59.260
ALAN SEALES: Yes, question.

00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:00.200
AUDIENCE: Hi, yeah.

00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:03.110
This goes along with
what you just asked.

00:47:03.110 --> 00:47:08.180
Since you're doing the
same role every night--

00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:10.950
I have a couple different
parts of this question,

00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:14.950
but-- since you're doing the
same role every night at what

00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:19.490
point do you feel
comfortable enough to say,

00:47:19.490 --> 00:47:23.240
tonight I'm just going to try
something crazy for this part?

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:25.731
And can you talk
about an experience

00:47:25.731 --> 00:47:27.522
that you've had where
you're like, I'm just

00:47:27.522 --> 00:47:28.260
going to do something
a little bit

00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:30.720
different in this aspect
of maybe the play?

00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:31.890
And how it worked out?

00:47:31.890 --> 00:47:34.280
And if it worked or
if it didn't work,

00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:37.860
or how it changed how you're
continuing on with the play,

00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:39.950
or you know?

00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:42.006
ERIN MACKEY: I mean,
yeah, definitely.

00:47:42.006 --> 00:47:45.620
There certainly are limitations
as to how much changes

00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:48.410
we can make once we've opened
the show, once the show is

00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:49.340
what we call "frozen."

00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:52.720
So the show is set in terms
of where-- pretty much

00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:54.260
where we're going to be moving.

00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:55.990
Because you don't want
to throw-- I mean,

00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:57.489
you've got set
pieces moving, you've

00:47:57.489 --> 00:47:58.949
got other people onstage.

00:47:58.949 --> 00:48:00.990
ALAN SEALES: It's all
automated, so you'd-- like,

00:48:00.990 --> 00:48:02.512
the hydraulics will
take an arm off.

00:48:02.512 --> 00:48:04.720
ERIN MACKEY: I mean, we have
people calling the cues.

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:06.136
But, yeah you have
to-- there does

00:48:06.136 --> 00:48:07.860
have to be a sense
of consistency.

00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:13.660
But within that, I mean,
we try new stuff every day.

00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:15.927
We listen to each
other, and we imagine

00:48:15.927 --> 00:48:17.010
that we're in that moment.

00:48:17.010 --> 00:48:19.470
And we know the
circumstances, and we

00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:22.720
know the places
we need to get to,

00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:24.640
but the way we get
there every night

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.320
is a little bit different.

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:27.820
Every single night.

00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:29.680
Depending on what's
happened in our day.

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:30.390
That affects me.

00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:31.765
LAIONA MICHELLE:
It's not so much

00:48:31.765 --> 00:48:33.840
that we-- oh, sure, you
want to speak on this?

00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:34.890
DAN: Hi, I'm Dan.

00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:37.300
I'm in the pit--
[INAUDIBLE] keyboard.

00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:44.280
And being from where I am,
it's a very flexible show.

00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:47.280
It has a breath
and an immediacy.

00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:49.090
There are a lot
of shows now that

00:48:49.090 --> 00:48:51.360
are to click tracks throughout
the entire production,

00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:55.930
so everything is kind
of forced on a routine.

00:48:55.930 --> 00:48:58.840
And there are only two
spots in this whole show

00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:02.680
that our click-tracked, and
it's for very specific safety

00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:06.720
reasons because of mechanical
things going on on stage.

00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:08.140
But we have an all acoustic pit.

00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:09.970
So we're very
present, as opposed

00:49:09.970 --> 00:49:12.390
to some shows where they're
in completely different floors

00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:13.780
or different buildings.

00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:16.075
I don't have-- I'm not
using any sort of headphones

00:49:16.075 --> 00:49:16.700
for everything.

00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:18.860
Everything is very
live, immediate.

00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:22.300
And that allows the conductor,
and in turn the orchestra,

00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:25.090
to be very responsive to
the impulses on stage.

00:49:25.090 --> 00:49:28.590
And I can attest,
every day the tempos

00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:31.710
shift slightly based on the
energy, based on the audience.

00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:33.860
And it's a relatively
intimate house.

00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:36.035
We have what, 1,162?

00:49:36.035 --> 00:49:38.160
As opposed to some of the
other theaters with three

00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:39.740
different balcony levels.

00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:44.740
And it really allows for a
unique performance every day.

00:49:47.902 --> 00:49:48.610
ALAN SEALES: Wow.

00:49:48.610 --> 00:49:50.860
So we are out of
time here already.

00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:55.160
But in closing, is there
anything specific--

00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:56.760
I guess we've talked about it.

00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:58.260
I was going to say
is there anything

00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:00.590
you want people to come
away from with the show.

00:50:00.590 --> 00:50:03.430
But the-- having conversations
and bringing things

00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:06.090
to the forefront of their
minds, and just, I guess, not

00:50:06.090 --> 00:50:11.410
ignoring problems is what this
show-- I guess, in my opinion--

00:50:11.410 --> 00:50:13.800
one of the underlying
messages of this whole show.

00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:17.390
So, I applaud you guys for
doing this eight times a week,

00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:18.590
putting yourself into it.

00:50:18.590 --> 00:50:20.340
God, like you guys
are just amazing.

00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:22.360
Everybody go see this.

00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:24.550
"Amazing Grace" at the
Nederlander Theater.

00:50:24.550 --> 00:50:27.680
208 West-- 208
West First Street,

00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:28.930
between seventh and eighth.

00:50:28.930 --> 00:50:30.930
AmazingGraceMusical.com.

00:50:30.930 --> 00:50:32.660
