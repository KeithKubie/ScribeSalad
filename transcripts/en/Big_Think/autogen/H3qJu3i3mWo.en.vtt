placebos in most cases of mild to
 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.929
placebos in most cases of mild to
moderate depression so I would say that

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939
moderate depression so I would say that
 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.630

think what to do about this I did a lot

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820
think what to do about this I did a lot
 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.930

and throughout the world one thing I
 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.550
and throughout the world one thing I
found is that that there's a great

everything

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780
everything

they're eating diets that are natural

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780
they're eating diets that are natural
 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.869
they're eating diets that are natural
not highly processed they're getting

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879
not highly processed they're getting
 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.750

plenty of physical activity they get

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760
plenty of physical activity they get
 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.759
plenty of physical activity they get
adequate rest and sleep I think very

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769
adequate rest and sleep I think very
 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.429

a very strong tribal and community
support so for all those reasons I think

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150
support so for all those reasons I think
 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.259

they're protected and when you look at

they're protected and when you look at
 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.679
they're protected and when you look at
what's changed in our society I think

00:02:59.679 --> 00:02:59.689
what's changed in our society I think
 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:02.710
what's changed in our society I think
you can see several trends our diet has

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720
you can see several trends our diet has
 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.839
you can see several trends our diet has
become very different from that of our
