1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:05,050
In war, the enemy is clear.
But in life, in business,

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,520
that's so easy to identify. Any tips?

3
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,780
Well, um, I mean first of all,

4
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:21,400
that is not a true statement. And in,

5
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,540
in war, the enemy is not always
clear, not at all. The enemy,

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,540
the enemy can be hard to identify,

7
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:34,030
very hard to identify the enemies gonna
use camouflage to conceal themselves.

8
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,900
They're going to use deception to,

9
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,970
to distract your attention.

10
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,590
They're going to blend in
with the friendly civilian
populous and they're going

11
00:00:43,591 --> 00:00:47,620
to take advantage of
your benevolence, right?

12
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:53,020
In fact, the enemy is going to do
absolutely everything in its power

13
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,150
to obscure their position,
to hide their purpose,

14
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,660
to even mask their identity.

15
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:07,090
So it is not easy to identify the enemy

16
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,450
in combat in war.

17
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:15,190
So what you have to do is you have to
control what you can control, right?

18
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,980
You got to be prepared. You've
got to train, you've got to study,

19
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,800
you've got to rehearse.
You've got to remain vigilant.

20
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:27,760
You've got to maintain discipline in
everything you do so that when the enemy

21
00:01:28,101 --> 00:01:29,540
does reveal itself,

22
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:34,690
you have the ability to out
think it to out maneuver,

23
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,230
to out fight the enemy.

24
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,900
And it's actually the same
thing in business, right?

25
00:01:44,901 --> 00:01:46,370
The enemy can be hard to identify.

26
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,260
Your competitors are
broadcasting their next move.

27
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,920
You don't know what the
market's going to do.

28
00:01:54,921 --> 00:01:58,310
You can't be certain about the next
trend or the next downturn or the next

29
00:01:58,311 --> 00:02:01,460
bubble that's gonna burst.
You can't know those things.

30
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,600
So you have to do the same thing. You
have to control what you can control,

31
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:10,190
which is you got to gather intelligence,

32
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,370
you gotta analyze the
metrics that you can track.

33
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:18,510
You've got to train yourself and your
team to be prepared for both the known and

34
00:02:18,981 --> 00:02:20,630
also be prepared for the unknown.

35
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:22,450
Okay?

36
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:27,450
Figure out what the likely
contingencies are and have some plans

37
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:33,160
to execute if those contingencies occur.

38
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,400
Maintain discipline as an organization
so that you have the flexibility and the

39
00:02:39,341 --> 00:02:44,080
responsiveness to maneuver effectively
and efficiently when the unpredictable

40
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,520
actually happens.

41
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,780
So instead of suffering and
falling apart in the chaos,

42
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,600
you can take advantage of it and win

43
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:00,820
and that's business and life is the same.

44
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,580
The enemy is not always clear in life.

45
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,490
It can be hard to tell who's
going to try and bring you down

46
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:12,830
or what is going to bring you
down. There's distractions,

47
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:14,590
okay?

48
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,470
There are things out there
that will do you harm,

49
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,970
that are so camouflaged.
You can't see them at all.

50
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,310
There are deceitful people.

51
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,760
There are accidents that can occur and
diseases that take root and there's bad

52
00:03:34,851 --> 00:03:39,851
luck and there's Murphy's law and there's
times when it seems that the whole

53
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,200
world is against you.

54
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:46,550
The whole world is the enemy.

55
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,080
[inaudible]

56
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,340
and the same rules apply.

57
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:58,750
Control what you can't
control. You train hard,

58
00:03:58,810 --> 00:03:59,620
learn,

59
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:04,620
maintain the mitigated daily
discipline in all things.

60
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,900
Yeah, train hard physically and mentally.

61
00:04:11,901 --> 00:04:16,901
Push yourself so hard that you become
accustomed to the stress you get used to

62
00:04:17,421 --> 00:04:18,254
it

63
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:22,440
every day.

64
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,640
Make yourself stronger and faster and
smarter and better so that when the enemy

65
00:04:30,901 --> 00:04:35,901
does finally climb out of the
shadows and expose himself to you,

66
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:41,880
you are ready. You are waiting

67
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:48,740
and you can relish in the opportunity
to attack and fight and utterly decimate

68
00:04:53,301 --> 00:04:54,770
and destroy him.
