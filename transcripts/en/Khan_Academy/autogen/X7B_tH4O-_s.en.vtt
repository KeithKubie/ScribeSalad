00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.420
 . 

00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.680
 In this presentation, I want to focus on the techniques most used 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.210
 To analyze the polynomials into their factors 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.130
 Specifically, I want to focus on quadratic equations that do not 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.310
 Have a coefficient of 1 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.540
 For example, if you want to solve 4x ^ 2 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.920
 + 25x - 21 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.440
 Everything we have focused on recently, or all quadratic equations 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.100
 We have recently focused on them, containing either 1 or 1 place 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.090
 This 4 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.880
 Now we have this 4 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.840
 So what I will teach you is a technique called 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.020
 Analysis of factors by aggregation 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.130
 They are more comprehensive than they may be 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.100
 We have learned it before, but at the same time it is deceptively deceptive 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.210
 To a certain extent, it will become old when you learn 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.600
 The quadratic formula, because the quadratic formula 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.230
 A little simpler 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.550
 But thus things are done 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.770
 I will let you know the technique 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.910
 And then at the end of the presentation, I will explain to you 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.300
 The reason for its success 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.430
 If what we need to do here, is that we will think about 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:02.120
 Two, a and b, so that it is a × b = 4 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.700
 X-21 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:12.530
 If a × b = 4 × -21 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.280
 Which equals -84 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.490
 These two numbers are the same, ie a and b, must 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.480
 The total shall be 25 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.930
 Let me be clear 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.300
 This is 25, so their total should be 25 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.970
 From here came the 4 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.540
 So we go, 4 × 21 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.270
 So -21 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.680
 So what are these numbers? 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.050
 Well, we have to look at factors-84 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.710
 Again, one of them will 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.550
 Be positive 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.870
 The other will be negative, because 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.170
 Their multiplication is a negative number 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.350
 So let's think about the different factors 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.420
 Which may succeed 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.465
 4 and 21 seem exciting, but when you combine them 

00:01:59.465 --> 00:02:01.970
 You get -17 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.870
 Or if we have -4 and 21, we get positive 17 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.010
 This did not work 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.220
 Let's try other ingredients 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.150
 1 and 84, they are very far apart when we take the difference between them 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.420
 Because that's what we're going to do, then 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.500
 One was negative and the other positive 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.840
 They are very chopsticks 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.370
 2 and 42 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.620
 Again, they are apart 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.800
 -2 + 42 = 40 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.650
 2 + -42 = -40 - apart from each other-- 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:41.020
 3 and - let us see, 84 3 3 - 8 3 3 = 2 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.860
 2 x 3 = 6 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.200
 8 - 6 = 2 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.610
 Download the 4 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.150
 = 8 Exactly 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.120
 If 3 and 28 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.370
 This sounds interesting 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.630
 3 and 28 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.920
 And remember, one of them must be negative 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:06.240
 If we have 3 + 28, this equals 25 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.220
 Now, we have created two numbers 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.200
 But it was not as simple a process 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:19.510
 We did when this was 1 or -1 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.330
 What we will do now is to break this phrase 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.160
 We will break them into - 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:35.800
 We will break it into a 28x-3x positive 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.590
 We will break up this phrase 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.890
 That phrase is the phrase 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.150
 Of course, we have 21 here, and we have 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.350
 4x ^ 2 here 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.100
 Now, maybe you will say, how I chose the 28K to get here 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.570
 And -3 to move here? 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.000
 In fact, this does not matter 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.730
 The way I thought was that 3 or 3, or 21 or 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.590
 21, have the same common factors 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.460
 Specifically, they share the common factor 3 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.780
 28 and 4 have the same common factors 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.940
 So I put 28 on the side with the 4 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.730
 You will see what I mean quickly 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:15.450
 If we compile this, the phrase becomes 4x ^ 2 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.140
 + 28x 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:25.880
 Then this side, written in pink here, is + 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.740
 -3x - 21 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.810
 I have chosen them again 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.300
 I've compiled -3 with 21, or -21 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.320
 Because both accept division by 3 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.790
 And I compiled 28 with 4, because both 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.250
 Accept the division on 4 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.800
 Now, in each of these groups, we analyzed 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.550
 As much as possible 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.050
 If both of these statements are divided by 4x 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:55.740
 This orange expression is equal to 4x × x - and 4x ^ 2 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:03.020
 The division is accepted at 4x and the output is x - + 28x 4 4x = 7 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.020
 Now, this second phrase 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.630
 Remember, we're analyzing everything 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.030
 It can be analyzed into factors 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.160
 Well, each of these phrases accepts division by 3 or 3 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.945
 So we extract the factor-3 

00:05:11.945 --> 00:05:16.260
 The phrase x + 7 becomes 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.690
 Now, maybe something will appear before you 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:25.350
 We have (x + 7) 4x + (x + 7) 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.150
 X-3 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.630
 If we can extract the factor x + 7 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.550
 Perhaps this is not entirely clear 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:34.900
 Perhaps you have been used to analyzing 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.490
 Full-edged equation 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.350
 But you can consider this to be a 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.790
 Or if you have 4xa - 3a, you can 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:43.930
 The common factor is extracted a 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.330
 I can leave this signal negative 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.150
 . 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.950
 Let me erase this positive sign from here 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.850
 Because it's -3, is not it? 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.970
 + 3 -3 draw 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.640
 So what can we do here? 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.270
 We have (x + 7) × 4x 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.040
 We have (x + 7) x-3 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.110
 Let us extract the x + 7 common factor 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:16.350
 We get (x + 7) (4x - 3) 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:18.790
 - This 3 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.110
 We have thus analyzed our bipolar phrase 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.550
 Sorry, we have analyzed the quadratic equation using aggregation 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.210
 We have analyzed them into the Bilateral Frontiers 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.140
 Let's solve another example of it, because 

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.770
 Including more 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.290
 But when you can, it will be more enjoyable 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:43.540
 So let's assume we want to analyze 6x ^ 2 + 7x + 1 

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:44.800
 In the same way 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:50.940
 We will find a × b which equals 1 × 6, ie 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:52.110
 Equals 6 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:57.460
 We find a + b which equals 7 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.520
 This is more direct 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.900
 What are the two - well, the obvious thing is 1 and 6, right? 

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.310
 1 x 6 = 6 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.620
 1 + 6 = 7 

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:10.150
 Our cues are a = 1 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:11.700
 Or let me not put signs in front of them 

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.650
 The numbers are 1 and 6 

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:19.740
 Now, we'll break it down to 1x and 6x 

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.420
 But we will assemble it, if it falls on one side 

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.090
 Share with him the same factor 

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:28.880
 If we get 6x ^ 2 here, + - 

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.520
 I will put the 6x first because 6 

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.170
 And 6 have a common factor 

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:37.580
 And then we get 1x, do not we? 

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.650
 6x + 1x = 7x 

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:40.830
 Thats all about it 

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.580
 The total must be 7 

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:46.000
 And then we have + 1 here 

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.320
 Now, in each of these groups, we can analyze 

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.220
 As much as possible 

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.080
 So let's extract the 6x factor from the first set 

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:58.020
 It becomes 6x × 6x. 

00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:59.480
 6x = x 

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:04.380
 6x 6 6x = 1 

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.730
 Hence, the second set - will 

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:08.130
 We get + here 

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:11.870
 But in this second set, we have x + 1 

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:16.500
 Or we can write 1 × (x + 1) 

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.440
 You can imagine that I have extracted the factor 1 

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:24.790
 Now, I have 6x × (x + 1) + 1 × (x + 1) 

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:27.740
 Well, we can extract the factor x + 1 

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:35.549
 If x = 1 is extracted, this equals x (1 + x) 

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:37.690
 (6x + 1) 

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:38.280
 I do 

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:41.460
 Distribute property in reverse 

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.230
 So I hope you did not find it so bad 

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:45.430
 Now, I'll explain why 

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:47.170
 The success of this magical system 

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:50.280
 The reason for his success 

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.530
 Let me take an example 

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:54.530
 I will use general terms 

00:08:54.530 --> 00:09:03.630
 Let's assume that I have (ax + b) (cx - in fact, I am 

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.300
 I'm afraid to use a and b 

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.760
 I think this will kill you, because I am 

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:08.930
 Use a and b here 

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:10.240
 They will not be the same 

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.760
 So let me use completely different characters 

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:24.000
 Let's assume that I have (fx + g) (hx - will use j 

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.240
 Instead of i 

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.450
 You will learn in the future why not prefer 

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:28.710
 Use i as a variable 

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:31.000
 How much will it equal? 

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.920
 Well, it will be fx × hx, which is equal to fhx 

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.710
 Then fx × j 

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:41.800
 If + fjx 

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:45.240
 Hence, we will get g × hx 

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.010
 If + ghx 

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:50.990
 Then g × j 

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:53.840
 + gj 

00:09:53.840 --> 00:10:02.500
 Or if we combine the two words in the middle, we will get fh × (x 

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:08.970
 + - combine these two terms - fj + ghx 

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:12.170
 + gj 

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:14.540
 Now, what did you do here? 

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.550
 Well, remember, in all these matters when we have 

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:20.650
 The coefficient is not 1 or -1, we look for 

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:23.560
 Two numbers the sum of which is equal to this, and the sum of their multiplication is equal to 

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.480
 This is the result of this 

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:31.780
 Well, here we have two totals - let's assume that a 

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:33.030
 = fj 

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:36.970
 Let's assume that a = fj 

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:37.750
 That's a 

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:40.930
 And b = gh 

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:43.730
 If a + b = that 

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:44.980
 Middle Lab 

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:48.370
 a + b = that is the middle coefficient 

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:52.100
 Then what is the outcome of a × b? a × b = 

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:56.260
 fj × gh 

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.140
 × gh 

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:01.320
 We can rearrange these terms, we strike 

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:04.430
 A set of phrases, if they can be rewritten as f × 

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:09.390
 h × g × j 

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:11.090
 All are equal 

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:14.620
 Well, what is the outcome of multiplying fh × gj? 

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:19.150
 This is equal to fh × gj 

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:22.530
 Well, this is equal to the first factor 

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:23.670
 Hard 

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:27.870
 If a + b = the middle coefficient 

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:31.930
 And a × b = the first coefficient x 

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:32.670
 Hard 

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:37.330
 For this reason, the analysis is considered to be aggregation 

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:40.180
 Successful, Okif we can find what 

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:42.200
 The value of a and b 

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.210
 Now, I'll end up doing something 

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:45.800
 Different, but so make sure we have 

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:49.130
 Well aware of the factors to be analyzed 

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:52.050
 What I want to do is to let you analyze things into their own factors 

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:52.940
 Completely 

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:55.160
 Something extra 

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.660
 I would like to make a presentation about him 

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:59.250
 But I guess, it might be to some extent 

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:00.480
 Clear to you 

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:07.190
 So let's assume that we have - let us take a good example here - 

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:12.910
 Suppose we have x ^ 3 + 17x ^ 2- 

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:18.180
 - 70x 

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:20.130
 You will say directly, this is not a quadratic equation 

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:21.770
 I do not know how such a thing is 

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:23.580
 It contains x ^ 3 

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:26.150
 The first thing you should realize is that each phrase 

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:27.840
 Here you can divide by x 

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.920
 So let us extract x as a common factor 

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.260
 Or better, let 's extract - 

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.320
 If you want -x, they become 

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.730
 -x × - -x ^ 3 

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:41.810
 X x = x ^ 2 

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:47.910
 17x ^ 2--x = -17x 

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:52.510
 70x--x- = positive 70 

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:54.060
 X is deleted 

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.050
 Now, we have something that may seem 

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:59.220
 Familiar with some thing 

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:02.530
 We have a typical quadratic equation 

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:03.650
 The coefficient is 1 

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:08.290
 We only have to find two numbers that hit 70 Khu 

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:11.000
 The total value is 17 

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.920
 And the numbers that will come straight into my mind 

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:17.410
 Are -10 and -7 

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:19.520
 We take the weight of their beating, which is 70 

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.870
 We collect them, so the result is 17 

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:25.920
 If this part will be (x - 10) 

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.410
 × (x - 7) 

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:31.540
 Of course, we have that x 

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:34.330
 The general idea here is to see if we have anything 

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:35.320
 It can be analyzed into factors 

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.780
 This leads us to the form perhaps you are aware of 

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:38.950
 I hope you found this offer useful 

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:41.145
 I want to repeat what I have made clear at the beginning 

00:13:41.145 --> 00:13:41.510
 this show 

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:44.960
 I think it's a pretty trick, say, that you can 

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:49.470
 Decompose the things that contain 

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:50.460
 Parameter 1 or -1 

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.720
 But to a certain extent, you will find faster ways 

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.370
 To do this, especially with the square formula 

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:56.620
 In a short time
