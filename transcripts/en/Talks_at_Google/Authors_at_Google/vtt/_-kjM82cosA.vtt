00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:01.470
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:04.410
JEN LANCASTER: Thank you.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.507
Hello, I am Jen
Lancaster, and I'm

00:00:06.507 --> 00:00:08.340
going to give you a
little bit of background

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.500
on what "The Tao of Martha"
is about and why I did it.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.770
And then I'm going to
get into the reading.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.510
I had the worst year ever in
2011, not for any big reason

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.640
just for like 1,000
stupid little reasons.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.930
We moved to this house
in the suburbs in a town

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.470
called Lake Forest.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.180
And it's called Forest
because no one's

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.560
allowed to cut down the trees
in the town-- because of Mr. T.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.430
20 years ago.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.270
Mr. T lived in this town and he
cut down all of the old growth

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.840
oak trees in his yard and Lake
Forest is a very snotty place.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.020
I live on-- not the good side.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.510
But it's a very snotty place--
think of like a New Canaan

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.590
or like Westchester.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:48.611
What are the other?

00:00:48.611 --> 00:00:49.110
Like that.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.410
Just imagine all preppy blue
bloods clutching their pearls

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.260
while Mr. T is out front
cutting down trees in his shorts

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.890
with his necklaces and stuff
and losing their minds.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.040
The Wall Street Journal
even covered the story

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.640
calling it "The Lake
Forest Chainsaw Massacre."

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.010
Such was everyone's-- that's
how disgruntled everyone was.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.640
The reason I mention this is
because in 2011, because people

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.080
can't cut down their
own damn trees,

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.290
we lost power about six times
over the course of the summer.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.090
And everybody around us had
generators except for us.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.430
So I spent my entire summer
buying new jars of mayonnaise

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.460
when the old ones went bad.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.425
So it was just a bad year and
by the time the year was over,

00:01:31.425 --> 00:01:33.550
I didn't I didn't even want
to celebrate Christmas.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.620
I just didn't want
any part of it.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.770
I wanted 2012 to start.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.641
So my husband said, we need
to do something in 2012 that

00:01:41.641 --> 00:01:43.140
will make us happy,
that will get us

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.760
past this really stupid year.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.929
And the other thing was,
I had this-- the best

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:48.470
dog in the world,
this pit bull who'd

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.011
been fighting cancer
for three years,

00:01:50.011 --> 00:01:52.300
and I knew that 2012,
it was going to be over.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.170
I knew that our luck
was going to run out.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.750
So I wanted to
bankroll happiness,

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.570
I want to stockpile it.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.810
And I'm a very practical person.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.690
I'm not going to turn to Oprah
to look for things to give me

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:06.420
all the feels.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.090
I want practicality.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.270
So when I was looking for a
way to do a happiness project,

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.800
I thought, what makes me happy?

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.950
It would make me happy if my
house were clean and organized.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.325
It would make me
happy if I could

00:02:16.325 --> 00:02:18.740
throw a party without wishing
all my guests would leave

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.980
immediately because I've
been working for three days,

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.688
and now I just want
to sit in the bathtub

00:02:22.688 --> 00:02:25.240
with a glass of wine
and have it be quiet.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.460
So I turned to Martha Stewart.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.020
Largely because every time
something would go wrong

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.970
in our house, something
household-wise,

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.650
my husband would
invoke her name.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.920
Such as, I wonder
if Martha Stewart

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.960
has to chase all
of her asshole cats

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.730
off the Thanksgiving buffet.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.150
The big one-- the
actual incident that

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.940
started this whole thing
was I lost a recipe

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.560
and we were having a party, and
I needed to make this recipe.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.869
And three hours later, we found
it in our kitchen gun cabinet.

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:54.410
And I bet Martha
Stewart doesn't even

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.890
have a kitchen gun cabinet.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.290
It's a teapot cabinet now.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.410
We did not build it.

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.610
So I decided to spend a
year of my life living

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.780
by Martha Stewart's dictates,
thus "The Tao of Martha."

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.130
Now this chapter that
I'm going to read to you

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.557
is about Halloween.

00:03:10.557 --> 00:03:12.890
And I have to give you the
background on my relationship

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.030
with Halloween.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.100
I despised Halloween so much.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.086
I mean it was fun
in grade school,

00:03:20.086 --> 00:03:23.350
you know, trick-or-treating
and picking up money for UNICEF

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.080
and going in costumes and
then just being in collage

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.470
and oh, I'm a slutty
football player.

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.200
But once I graduated and I
started working a day job where

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.000
people still celebrated
Halloween, it bothered me.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.660
Don't talk to me about your
mission statement, Batman,

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.830
I can't take you seriously
in your superhero costume.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.710
So Halloween started
to bother me.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.530
Especially one day when I
went to deposit my paycheck

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.580
on Halloween and the
teller was in an ape suit.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.150
That does not build faith in
one's financial institution.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.130
It got to the point--
and my husband

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.510
and I didn't live in great
neighborhoods in Chicago.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.970
So we got to the
point where-- like

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.750
you don't want to open
your door for thugs.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:06.730
Because they may want candy.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:07.980
They may want your television.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.510
You don't know.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.290
I would tape garbage
bags over my windows

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.150
so it would look
like we weren't home,

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.910
because we were too broke to
actually go out to dinner.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.690
So this is my relationship
with Halloween.

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.930
But when you spend a year
of your life embracing

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.710
the Tao of Martha, you
have to include Halloween.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.750
That's like-- it's
not her Superbowl,

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.580
but it's definitely
a playoff game.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.620
I mean she has like her own
Halloween spin-off magazines.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.110
So I had to learn to
embrace the Tao of Martha,

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.170
which was celebrating.

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.190
And I started off
the Halloween season

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.175
by learning how to
put glitter on things.

00:04:43.175 --> 00:04:45.300
I thought, OK, I'm just
going to throw some glitter

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.000
on a couple of pumpkins
and call things decorated.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.100
Like four hours
later, I had glittered

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.670
every surface in my house.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.650
I had glitter
Stockholm syndrome.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.630
It was the greatest
thing to ever happen

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.500
to me in my entire life.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.530
So I thought, I'm going
to do this Halloween up

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.230
so big you're not even
going to believe it.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.030
So now I will get into
the actual reading.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.240
"Because I feel a
real karmic debt

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.700
for shuttering my home for the
past decade, I'm going all out

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.990
and I'm giving away
full size candy bars.

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.700
I still remember who gave me the
big bars almost 40 years ago.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.660
So I love the idea
of being the house

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.530
that kids recollect fondly
when they're adults."

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.520
Even though we did buy our house
because it was set way back

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.670
and it was sort of in
the woods and I thought,

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.753
we're not going to get a
lot of trick-or-treaters.

00:05:29.753 --> 00:05:33.140
That was honest to God, a
selling point of my house.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.090
Anyway.

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.880
"If full size candy
bars keep local kids

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.820
from playing mailbox
baseball at my house

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.780
when they become
teenagers, all the better.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.900
Such is my Halloween
spirit that even

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.930
my husband Fletch participates.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.260
He dons his army
surplus gear and straps

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.920
on his ridiculously
realistic Airsoft bb

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.474
guns with bonus ammo vest.

00:05:53.474 --> 00:05:55.390
He settles in at the
dining room table with me

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.650
to wait for the hordes
of local youths hankering

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.300
for 10 CCs of Twix bars, stat.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.590
I'm ready.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.490
Let's rock this."

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.205
Oh, and I was also-- I was
wearing this I like 50s sock

00:06:06.205 --> 00:06:08.830
hop costume, because here's the
thing-- when you're a plus size

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.460
girl, there is not a lot of
costumes available to you.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.570
You can be like a
saucy pirate wench.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.512
Or like a saucy opera singer.

00:06:15.512 --> 00:06:17.720
So they weren't there weren't
a lot of opportunities.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.240
And you can't wear pearls
with either one of those.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.690
OK, so-- "4:01, one minute
into the official Lake Forest

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.860
trick-or-treating
hours, our bell rings.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.094
Showtime.

00:06:29.094 --> 00:06:30.635
Fletch answers the
door, while I dash

00:06:30.635 --> 00:06:32.830
to retrieve my
tray full of booty.

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.720
With my back turned,
I hear the mailman

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.290
gasp when Fletch's body armor
slash arsenal, pretty much

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:40.240
scares the pants off of him."

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.929
I think our mailman drinks,
by the way, that's an aside.

00:06:43.929 --> 00:06:45.470
"Judging from the
mailman's reaction,

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.750
I guess he doesn't usually
deliver certified letters

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.500
to the fully armed.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:54.120
Clearly, he has never delivered
mail in our old neighborhood.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.660
Fletch then
compliments the postman

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.360
on his realistic
costume and the guy

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.840
doesn't even laugh a little bit.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.050
No candy for you, pal.

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.080
While we wait for
business, I anxiously

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.000
rearrange my enormous
silver candy platter.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.059
Why the hell do I feel nervous?

00:07:09.059 --> 00:07:10.600
I used to get tense
when I was trying

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.990
to dodge the
trick-or-treaters, so afraid

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:15.610
that they would
catch me unprepared.

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:16.760
But today?

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.680
I could not be more
ready for them today.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.510
The house is super festive.

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:23.010
The treats are ridiculous.

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:26.660
And we are both in costume
with bonus positive attitudes.

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.610
Fletch is particularly compliant
because he secretly proud

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.400
that his ensemble scared
our feckless mailman.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.920
He had me take a bunch of
pictures of him in his costume,

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.420
and then he posted
them on Facebook,

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.390
adding caption on
how he was dressed

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:43.230
as an Army Special forces
guy, not a Navy SEAL.

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:45.420
He wrote that you could
tell he was a Green

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:49.220
Beret because his hands
were in his pockets.

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:53.060
I said that this would make
no sense to 99% of the world,

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.400
particularly since he
wasn't wearing a beret,

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.670
but he promised me that
his enlightened followers

00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:00.805
on Facebook would find
that absolutely hysterical.

00:08:00.805 --> 00:08:03.600
Yeah, I'm going to have
to take his word on that.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.840
A week later, we see my
friend Stacy for my birthday,

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.390
and she compliments
Fletch the authenticity

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:11.020
with the whole esoteric
hands-pocket things,

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.820
and he positively
beams because he

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.800
has no idea that she's
messing with him.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.650
Anyway, I don't
understand why I'm

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:21.440
anxious because I've executed
an outstanding version

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.700
of the Martha Stewart
Living Halloween.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:28.070
This day has Martha's stamp
of approval all over it.

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:29.960
I really put in
the effort to make

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.030
everything special and elegant.

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:34.590
Given that my last go around
at a Martha-type event

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:39.230
on the 4th of July turned into
a um, redneck, white trash,

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:42.720
he-haw ho-down-- never
order your decorations

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.812
on Amazon, just FYI.

00:08:44.812 --> 00:08:47.780
But I raised the bar
here exponentially.

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.370
As I take in my surroundings,
I'm confident in my creation,

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:51.780
and I wouldn't change a thing.

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:54.900
And yet I'm jittery
still all the same.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.440
My commitment to
Halloween planning

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.440
has given me a real
sense of satisfaction

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.534
and the kind of
peace of mind I've

00:09:00.534 --> 00:09:02.200
been hoping to gain
ever since I started

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.190
this project in January.

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:06.910
Once I came to terms with
my initial misgivings

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:09.020
and threw myself
into the process,

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.220
I have had the best time.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.910
In fact, when I was glittering
my gourds last Saturday,

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:16.020
I couldn't stop
saying, this is so

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.890
fun I can't believe
how much I love this."

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:21.390
Oh, just FYI, the
book's subtitle

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:24.650
"Why I'm Never, Ever Getting
All That Glitter Off the Dog"--

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:26.710
believe it.

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:28.090
"When I was
decorating yesterday,

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:30.610
I realized that I was
singing to myself.

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:33.780
Badly of course, but
that's not important.

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:37.560
Breaking out into song is kind
of my good mood barometer,

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.320
and I haven't done that
since we lost our dog, Maisy.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.870
And this is for me
is so significant.

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:45.590
A month ago I honestly worried
that I would never feel joy

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:48.600
again I couldn't go through
a day without crying.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.830
But here I am moving on
and letting happiness

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:54.560
in without feeling
guilty for it.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.030
While I wait, I merchandise the
big bars in attractive rows,

00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:59.730
and I group the
treat bags together."

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:01.660
They were shaped like
witches and broomsticks

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:07.461
and they were full of mini
candy bars-- like ten, come on.

00:10:07.461 --> 00:10:09.210
"I decide I'm going
to let the kids decide

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:11.120
if they want a full
sizer or if they'd

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.760
like to pick what's behind
curtain number two in the treat

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.060
bags I put together.

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:17.190
Personally, I would
go for the unknown.

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:19.370
Could be a bag of candy,
but it's Lake Forest,

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:20.920
so it could be a
bag of gold bullion.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.720
You don't know.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:26.100
As I survey the bounty, I
hope I made the right choices.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.220
From what I understand,
children need

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:32.110
to be hermetically sealed in
a bubble until the age of 18,

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:34.850
so I'm concerned that the
chocolate bars may be an issue.

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:38.200
My friend recently told me
that in her kid's pre-K class

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.750
there were four
peanut allergies, one

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:43.230
strawberry allergy,
two gluten frees

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:45.840
due to issues with wheat,
one corn allergy, and one

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.950
lactose intolerant child.

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:51.280
This is out of 14
total students.

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.950
What do parents bring
in for birthday treats?

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:55.400
Strippers?

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.090
What do you do?

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:01.020
'Is it OK that some of these
candy bars have nuts?' I ask

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:01.960
Fletch.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:02.710
'What do you mean?

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:04.630
All the best chocolate
bars contain nuts,

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:05.740
everyone knows that.

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.920
See, you've got
your Baby Ruth's,

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:11.440
your Snickers, your Paydays,
plus Reese's Cups and Mars.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:14.020
Also, Butterfingers count
because they use ground roast

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:14.740
peanuts.

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:17.570
Candy bars with nuts are at
the top of the sweet-based food

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:18.070
chain.

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:21.680
Fact.' He pauses thoughtfully,
and then makes a face.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.340
'Except for Almond Joy,
those are just wrong.'

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:27.560
'Yeah,' I agree, not convinced.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.460
'But what if parents give us
shit for passing out bars with

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:31.590
nuts in them?'

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:32.570
He shrugs.

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:35.790
'Then I suggest that they stop
encouraging their children

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:39.280
to take candy from strangers.'

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.840
He returns his attention to
his Facebook page and his iPad,

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:45.780
waiting for everyone to comment
on his hilarious pocket jokes.

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.440
I suspect he will be
waiting for a while.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.440
Speaking of waiting, um, hello?

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:55.510
It's 4:15 and we've seen no one.

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:58.240
Not a Power Ranger has
walked past this house,

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.660
let alone come down the drive.

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:02.710
4:20 PM.

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:04.130
Nothing.

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:06.290
4:30 PM.

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:07.310
No one.

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:09.280
4:35 PM.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.990
I open the front door and yell,
'Kids, I have lots of candy.

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:15.460
Please come ring my bell.'

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.770
Fletch comments, 'That didn't
sound menacing or creepy

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:20.020
at all.'

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:21.920
4:45 PM.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:25.480
I'll just have a little
glass of wine while I wait.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.550
4:50 PM.

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:27.920
Did I turn the porch lights on?

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:28.750
I double check.

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:30.810
Yeah, they're on.

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:32.030
5 o'clock PM.

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:35.210
Yo, yo, yo, where my
trick-or-treaters at?

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:36.630
5:05 PM.

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:38.780
Maybe I'll have a
splash more wine.

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:40.980
Possibly two splashes.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.050
5:15 PM.

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:44.960
Yeah, you can top
up my glass Fletch.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.910
It's not like I'm busy
giving anyone candy.

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:52.245
5:30 PM, more wine.

00:12:52.245 --> 00:12:54.370
New bottle, more wine.

00:12:54.370 --> 00:13:00.100
5:35 PM, spill my glass,
prompting Fletch to exclaim,

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:03.210
'please don't lick wine
off the furniture.'

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:04.600
5:40 PM.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.850
I tweet, come and
get your damn camfy

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:10.840
see before I am too drunk.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.630
5:45 PM.

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:16.170
It's wine o'clock
somewhere, but mostly here.

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:21.430
5:50 PM, I tweet, I am Linus in
the GD pumpkin patch right now.

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:23.920
Come get your stupid
candy, you stupid kids.

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.300
Augh, I hate you.

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:27.480
6:00 PM.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.980
'Maybe all the neighbors have
been busy with soccer practice

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:31.646
and dinner, and they're
just now getting

00:13:31.646 --> 00:13:34.040
to trick-or-treating,'
Fletch suggests.

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.280
6:05 PM.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.590
Then I had better fill
up before the onslaught.

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:39.640
6:10 PM.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.410
Onslaught, onslaught, anyone?

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:44.000
Onslaught?

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.360
6:15 PM.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.740
How long does it take for
them to remove their cleats

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:50.600
and eat some chicken fingers?

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:51.960
6:20 PM.

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.180
Yeah, I'll have more
wine, thank you.

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:56.590
6:30 PM.

00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:58.900
I'm starting to
see two Fletchers.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:01.280
One of them has his
hands out of his pockets,

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:04.700
so he must be a Navy SEAL.

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:06.375
6:45 PM.

00:14:06.375 --> 00:14:08.700
'What are we doing for
dinner?' Fletch asks.

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:12.120
I respond by chucking a
Milky Way at his head.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:15.300
He says nothing, instead
opting to bring me more wine.

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:16.710
7 o'clock PM.

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:19.810
I open the door and shout,
'I have full size candy bars,

00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:21.210
you little assholes.

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:23.880
Come and get them right now
so you can have your magical

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.790
Martha Stewart
memories as an adult.'

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:28.490
Behind me, Fletch
mumbles something

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:31.460
about needing some pizza to
sop up all my excess Halloween

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:32.720
cheer.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.850
7:10 PM.

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:37.480
I kind of forget what
happens after this.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.540
11:43 PM.

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:42.910
I wake up surrounded by
snoozing dogs, an empty pizza

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:46.250
box, and one very smug spouse.

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:49.300
Fletch tells he had to keep me
from accosting the pizza guy

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.970
when he rang the bell a
minute before the official end

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:54.500
of trick-or-treat
time at 8:00 PM.

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:56.710
Fletch sent him on his way
with an extra large tip

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:58.651
a handful of Snickers bars.

00:14:58.651 --> 00:15:00.150
I have no recollection
of this but I

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:02.441
suspect he's telling the
truth because Green Berets are

00:15:02.441 --> 00:15:04.380
notoriously honest.

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:07.230
I'm still a little groggy as
I change out of my costume

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:10.340
and don my pajamas while I
reflect on the whole Halloween

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:12.110
experience.

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:13.070
I did it.

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:16.420
I faced my enormous
fear of Halloween

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:19.830
and with Martha's
guidance, I got through it.

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:22.300
In fact, I got over it.

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:25.240
I don't despise
Halloween anymore.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.730
I'm not sure I love
it, but I'm not

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:28.854
going to go all Jehovah's
Witness in the face of it

00:15:28.854 --> 00:15:30.330
anymore.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:33.440
I began traditions this year
that I'm going to continue.

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.340
Maybe I won't ever wear
my costume to the bank,

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:39.060
but I sure as hell will
decorate some gourds.

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:41.730
I might make my whole
house festive again.

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:43.920
Maybe I'll even host a
party for my friends' kids,

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:46.680
because damn it, someone needs
to receive some full size candy

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:47.700
bars.

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.180
Even if they're
not my neighbors.

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:51.720
In terms of personal
contentment,

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.780
I feel exponentially
better about life

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:56.610
at the end of October than
I did at the beginning.

00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:59.200
Working on this project allowed
me to focus on something other

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.870
than missing my dog, and prove
to me that I can absolutely

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:04.290
be happy in my life again.

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:06.320
I was able to strengthen
bonds with my husband,

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.400
and I started having
fun again, so much

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:11.970
so that it was able to share it
with readers on social media.

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:14.740
So the Tao of Martha
tenant that I've taken away

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:18.250
from this experiences
is seize the opportunity

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:21.550
to create new memories
and traditions.

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:25.590
Hey Halloween, you and I,
we're no longer in a fight.

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:28.410
We're officially OK.

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:30.480
Am I going to put you
back on the buddy list?

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.490
Well, that remains to be seen.

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:35.190
But the one thing that
I can say for sure

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:40.090
is that I am glittering
the shit out of Christmas."

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:43.436
Thank you. [APPLAUSE]

00:16:43.436 --> 00:16:45.060
I don't have to hide
behind my podium

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:46.960
when I'm not holding my papers.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.549
I love talking to people.

00:16:49.549 --> 00:16:50.965
So if you guys
have questions, now

00:16:50.965 --> 00:16:55.235
would be a really
outstanding time to ask them.

00:16:55.235 --> 00:16:56.205
AUDIENCE: I have one.

00:16:56.205 --> 00:16:56.997
JEN LANCASTER: Yes.

00:16:56.997 --> 00:16:59.205
AUDIENCE: What did Martha
Stewart think of your book?

00:16:59.205 --> 00:17:00.740
Or did she write
to you about it--

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:02.370
JEN LANCASTER: OK, here's
the deal with Martha Stewart.

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:03.911
And you guys already
heard this story

00:17:03.911 --> 00:17:05.426
so you just pretend to be happy.

00:17:05.426 --> 00:17:07.050
When I started working
on this project.

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:08.680
I started working
on it in January.

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.442
In April of that year, I got a
call from my film agent saying,

00:17:11.442 --> 00:17:12.900
hey, how would you
feel about doing

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.720
a show with Martha Stewart?

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:17.460
I would feel real
good about that.

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:18.440
I don't know what
that would look like,

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:19.730
but I would feel
real good about that.

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:21.770
So we sort of went back
and forth with ideas

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:23.510
because we were with
the same agency.

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:25.829
I suspect they actually
return Martha's calls.

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:28.065
I'm just guessing.

00:17:28.065 --> 00:17:29.440
So they were trying
to figure out

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:32.330
what they could do with
the concept of the show.

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:34.704
And they wanted to do a sitcom.

00:17:34.704 --> 00:17:36.370
But I didn't know how
to write a sitcom.

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:37.670
I know how to write books.

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:40.170
So they paired me
with a screenwriter

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:42.760
who came up with the
concept for the show.

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.290
And the thing that is-- I don't
if it's funny or insulting,

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:48.250
but he based the whole
thing exactly on my life.

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:51.980
And took it to the networks and
they said, wow, we hate her.

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:53.490
We hate everything
about her, so he

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:58.030
had to make the main character
10 years younger, thinner,

00:17:58.030 --> 00:17:59.905
divorced, and with a
kid to make her likable.

00:17:59.905 --> 00:18:01.738
Because apparently when
you don't have kids,

00:18:01.738 --> 00:18:02.590
you're not likable.

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:04.580
But it was still, it was
some sort of in the stages,

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:05.736
and it was sort of working.

00:18:05.736 --> 00:18:07.110
And over the course
of the summer

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:10.500
they were able to get Martha
herself to sign onto the show.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.670
So when it came time to go
to the actual pitch meetings,

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:15.960
Martha Stewart,
the screenwriter,

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.210
and Brian Grazer of
Imagine Entertainment

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:20.110
went to all the networks.

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:24.079
I was at my house picking up
dog crap in my dining room,

00:18:24.079 --> 00:18:26.370
literally the day that they
were in the pitch meetings,

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:30.770
because I became
superfluous to the process.

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:32.800
And the show sold.

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:34.420
NBC and Fox both wanted to show.

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:36.290
The show ended up
being sold to Fox.

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:38.900
And this was all very
cool and very exciting.

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:42.760
It ultimately didn't get made--
which is a shame because Martha

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.260
was going to be in
the show, and she

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:47.480
was going to say the line that
I would have killed or died

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:48.100
to hear.

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:49.530
She was going to
say that glitter

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:51.850
is the STD of the
crafting world.

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:58.040
I mean to hear her say that,
that's an iconic moment.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:00.130
So the show ended
up not happening,

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:02.460
but this whole time-- like
six months before the book

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:04.980
came out, we were going to be
on the Today Show together.

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:06.800
And I was beside myself.

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:09.320
The Today Show came to my house
and filmed my Cinco de Mayo

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:10.010
party.

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:11.610
And we were all set for it.

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:14.310
It was going to be the
greatest day of my life.

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:16.389
And the day before
I was supposed

00:19:16.389 --> 00:19:18.430
to be on with her, I get
this call and they said,

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:20.751
oh Martha may not be there.

00:19:20.751 --> 00:19:22.750
What do you mean Martha's
not going to be there?

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:24.730
Because she's on the TiVo guide.

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:28.740
Because I preset my
TiVo before I left.

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:31.100
So then I thought,
oh, I know what this.

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.610
This like on "Ellen"
where she has

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:36.747
the kid in the
wheelchair who couldn't

00:19:36.747 --> 00:19:38.580
go to Disneyland with
the rest of his church

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:41.410
because the church's bus is
not handicapped equipped.

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:45.317
So Ellen gives him the
mouse ears and kids, like,

00:19:45.317 --> 00:19:46.150
oh this is so great.

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:46.900
This is such a great day.

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:48.399
But then she pulls
back the curtains

00:19:48.399 --> 00:19:50.510
and there's a minivan
handicapped equipped

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:51.889
for the kid and his church.

00:19:51.889 --> 00:19:53.930
This is what I thought
"The Today Show" was going

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:56.550
to do for me,
because I love Martha

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:58.300
and they know that I
love Martha because I

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:01.060
said nothing but nice
things about her.

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:02.850
So I assumed that
they were just going

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:04.146
to tell me she wasn't
there and then they

00:20:04.146 --> 00:20:05.330
were going to surprise me.

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:06.830
So the whole night
before, because I

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:08.830
didn't want to look
really stupid on TV,

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:11.180
I made like attractive
surprise play faces.

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:16.650
Because, you know I didn't
want that to happen.

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:18.200
So the next to the
next day when I'm

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.430
on TV with Savannah Guthrie,
she's interviewing me.

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:23.360
And I'm yeah, OK, whatever--
I'm like not even listening

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.470
to her because I'm
watching the whole time,

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:28.430
waiting for Martha come in
so I can be really surprised.

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:30.514
Yeah, she did not come in.

00:20:30.514 --> 00:20:32.930
So you can see at the end of
the interview when it's over,

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:38.522
I'm just like-- you can
see me just deflate.

00:20:38.522 --> 00:20:39.980
So yeah, Martha
was on the next day

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:41.646
with the chairman of
Match.com because I

00:20:41.646 --> 00:20:43.124
suspect they wrote her a check.

00:20:43.124 --> 00:20:45.290
They wrote her the kind of
check I cannot write her.

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:47.460
So I have never met her.

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:50.370
And now it's like my
Susan Lucci moment,

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:53.220
the not winning the Emmy thing.

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:55.230
So now it's just funny,
but now I'm kind of mad.

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:56.930
Is she here?

00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:59.120
Because I'll forgive
her, I totally will.

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.880
I keep sort of
half expecting her

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:02.919
to show up to my event tonight.

00:21:02.919 --> 00:21:05.210
And over the course of all
this stuff with the TV show,

00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:07.240
I got her email address.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.955
It is all I could
do not to subscribe

00:21:08.955 --> 00:21:10.920
her to like the
birdwatcher's of the month

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.837
newsletter, because I'm mad.

00:21:12.837 --> 00:21:14.420
Because this was a
lovely book and she

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:17.260
was so behind the TV
thing, but the book--

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:20.000
she told someone that she
thought it was charming.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.030
Well that's great, could you
tell someone else, anywhere?

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:26.880
Like on your show or
something or in your magazine?

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:31.012
But no, so I'm not
that happy with her.

00:21:31.012 --> 00:21:32.970
But I'm willing to forgive
her if you guys have

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:34.310
any ins with her.

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:37.411
Anyway, what else would
you guys like to know?

00:21:37.411 --> 00:21:39.410
Or are you afraid that
if you answer a question,

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:41.034
it's going to be 10
minutes long again?

00:21:43.275 --> 00:21:44.858
AUDIENCE: How did
you get into Martha?

00:21:44.858 --> 00:21:47.864
I've been a fan since I was 12.

00:21:47.864 --> 00:21:48.780
JEN LANCASTER: Really?

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:50.850
See, I didn't like her.

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:52.712
I didn't like for years.

00:21:52.712 --> 00:21:54.170
Oh no, you should
be afraid of her,

00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:57.180
because I think that she
could make you disappear.

00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:58.340
I mean I really do.

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:00.430
But I didn't like her.

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:01.760
I thought she was smug.

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:04.320
And I thought she made people
feel bad about themselves.

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:09.780
It wasn't until she went to
prison and came back humbled.

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:12.849
I mean, she rose to the
occasion and I respect that.

00:22:12.849 --> 00:22:14.890
I respect anybody who goes
through something hard

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:16.470
and comes out
stronger than ever.

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:18.794
Because she could have
been released from prison

00:22:18.794 --> 00:22:21.210
and then just gone off and
lived her life as a billionaire

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:22.080
very quietly.

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.090
But she came back and
was like, oh, I'm sorry,

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:26.000
did you think I wasn't
still Martha Stewart?

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.670
Because I am.

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:28.520
I love that.

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:31.340
And in prison, she made friends.

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:33.230
She made ponchos.

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:35.530
she learned to make
the microwave dinners.

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:37.110
I thought that was outstanding.

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:39.560
And then, she made
fun of herself.

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:42.060
And oh my god, if you want to
make me fall in love with you,

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:44.300
then have some self-awareness.

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:44.950
And she did.

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:48.800
And it was when I made her
buttercream cupcake frosting

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.780
recipe the first
time I thought, oh, I

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:52.690
think she knows something.

00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:57.320
And my life has been
exponentially better

00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:59.470
for living by her dictates.

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:02.090
The one thing that I did over
the course of this project--

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:05.200
I wanted to do something
that she hadn't done.

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.760
Or I wanted to take
one of her ideas

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:10.570
and turn it into something
that was strictly my own.

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:14.330
And this was around the
time of Hurricane Sandy.

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:16.610
So I thought, what
I'm going to do

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:19.030
is learn how to
prepare for a disaster,

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:22.150
and over the course of the
book I accidentally became

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:25.630
one of those preppers with
a basement full of food.

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:27.660
To the point where
my prepping made

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:29.580
me forget about
Thanksgiving coming up,

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:31.980
and that's when my husband
said, you have to stop this.

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:34.560
Because I was asking
him questions like,

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:38.239
what's our water filtration
process going to look like?

00:23:38.239 --> 00:23:40.280
Where are we going to get
sources of fresh water?

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:43.960
Should we have carp
to put in the pool

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.310
if the balloon goes up?

00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:48.390
And he's like, you have to
stop this, you're scaring me.

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:52.984
So that was an
unfortunate side effect.

00:23:52.984 --> 00:23:54.650
But otherwise the
book went really well.

00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:58.877
And I gave all of the
food to a food bank

00:23:58.877 --> 00:24:00.960
when I heard that all these
people lost their SNAP

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:01.460
benefits.

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:04.640
And that out worked better.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:05.506
Anything else?

00:24:05.506 --> 00:24:06.672
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:24:06.672 --> 00:24:07.463
JEN LANCASTER: Yes.

00:24:07.463 --> 00:24:09.460
AUDIENCE: What was your
favorite Martha mem--

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:13.027
like what was your favorite
thing to do in the whole book?

00:24:13.027 --> 00:24:15.360
JEN LANCASTER: I'm trying of
what my favorite thing was.

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.568
Well, I'll tell you what my
least favorite thing was.

00:24:17.568 --> 00:24:19.670
I thought that I would
really be a good gardener.

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:20.590
Because that was
always something

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:23.260
that sort of interested me,
and I always lived in the city

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:24.550
and I had container gardens.

00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:26.700
You know, you have your pot, you
put your dirt in, it's great.

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:28.200
But we had this
house and I thought,

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.110
I'm going to garden this house.

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:33.900
Here's the thing about the
dirt that is in the ground.

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:35.310
It is hard.

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:36.250
It is damp.

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:39.610
It is full of bugs and full
of clay and full of roots,

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:41.240
and it sucks.

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.930
I was trying to plant
pansies in my front yard,

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:46.454
and I sat on a fire ant anthill.

00:24:46.454 --> 00:24:48.370
And I was wearing-- it
was like 1,000 degrees.

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:50.444
I was wearing a bathing
suit and track pants.

00:24:50.444 --> 00:24:52.360
And I threw my pants off
in front of the house

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:53.950
and cars were running
over it, and I

00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:56.560
was running around like crying.

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.100
I'm not a fan of gardening now.

00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:01.190
I really thought but I would do
well with that but I did not.

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:02.480
I loved Halloween.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:03.657
Christmas was great.

00:25:03.657 --> 00:25:05.740
This is the greatest thing
in the entire universe.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:08.310
My Christmas
presents that year--

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:11.730
because ultimately I
still had to be me.

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:14.640
So I had this ribbon
custom made from a place

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.320
that Martha Stewart
recommended and on it it said,

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:19.290
ho, ho, ho, motherfucker.

00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:21.580
Come on, would you not love
to get a Christmas present

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:22.249
wrapped up that?

00:25:22.249 --> 00:25:23.540
Like oh, what a beautiful gift.

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:24.415
You're so thoughtful.

00:25:27.401 --> 00:25:28.900
I thought that that
was outstanding.

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:31.525
And then this last year
I was going to-- oh,

00:25:31.525 --> 00:25:34.150
I had something else dirty and
I forgot what I was going to do.

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:37.896
I didn't end up doing it,
but that was really fun.

00:25:37.896 --> 00:25:38.395
Yes?

00:25:38.395 --> 00:25:39.978
JEN LANCASTER: What
was more exciting,

00:25:39.978 --> 00:25:42.600
the cost of being like
Martha or the time it took?

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.510
AUDIENCE: You know, I ended up--
because of living like Martha,

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:46.670
I ended up saving both.

00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:49.370
Because my husband
and I are big people

00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:52.920
who-- even though neither one
of us actually has a day job,

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.590
it's 6:30 and there's
no plans for dinner.

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:58.290
So we were ordering from
Grub Hub every single night.

00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:00.580
But in living by
Martha, I actually

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:02.240
was better at planning things.

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:04.532
So we had food that
we made ourselves

00:26:04.532 --> 00:26:06.240
that was better than
what we could order.

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.781
And it ended up
being less expensive.

00:26:07.781 --> 00:26:11.010
And it actually helped
us plan our time.

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:14.000
And I became much better
at throwing parties and not

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.540
hating everyone
who was in my house

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:16.972
that I just wanted to leave.

00:26:16.972 --> 00:26:19.180
Like every time they're
like, oh I'm having red wine,

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:20.910
but I'm going to
switch to a cocktail.

00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:24.425
Wishing them dead because
they dirtied a second glass,

00:26:24.425 --> 00:26:26.985
you know.

00:26:26.985 --> 00:26:29.110
AUDIENCE: Did you ever have
a successful Halloween,

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:30.400
where any kids came and--

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.213
JEN LANCASTER: No.

00:26:31.213 --> 00:26:32.120
AUDIENCE: Never?

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:33.340
JEN LANCASTER: Two years.

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:34.380
No kids.

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:35.930
AUDIENCE: Where did they go?

00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:37.260
JEN LANCASTER: I don't know.

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:39.924
They don't come to
my-- I think it's

00:26:39.924 --> 00:26:41.840
like-- I live on the
west side of Lake Forest,

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:43.530
but the east side
is all rich kids.

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:47.520
And they either have people
go get their candy for them,

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:48.940
or they don't care.

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:51.130
I mean because
when I was a kid, I

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:52.930
got 50 cents a
week for allowance.

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:54.000
You can't buy much candy.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.902
That was like how I got
my stores up for the year.

00:26:56.902 --> 00:26:58.860
Maybe these kids can just
buy candy themselves.

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:00.240
I don't know.

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.580
They were not into it.

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:04.840
And then this year--
2012, they didn't come.

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:06.690
2013, they didn't come.

00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:08.935
This year, I'm not
even turning lights on.

00:27:08.935 --> 00:27:09.790
I don't care.

00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:11.540
You've had your chance.

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:13.060
They had their chance.

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:15.710
They're done.

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:16.210
yes?

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:19.210
AUDIENCE: So, what was the
last day of the year like?

00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:21.160
And then after that,
what are the things

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.850
that you maintained in your life
even though the year of Martha

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:26.010
was over?

00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:28.720
JEN LANCASTER: Well, we didn't
have a New Year's party,

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.220
because I'm not a
New Year's person.

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:33.810
But the last year, we ended up
having the same holiday party

00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:35.640
that the book begins
with, except I

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:38.770
was able to do everything
right and actually enjoy

00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:39.970
my friends' time.

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:42.440
So now a party between
Christmas and New Year's is

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:43.530
our big thing.

00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:46.870
And now that I've done a few
times and I've done it well.

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:48.810
This year, we have
a bunch of people

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:50.020
that stayed at our house.

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:52.730
I bought us all matching
Christmas jammies.

00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:54.990
It was the greatest thing
in the entire universe

00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:56.460
to see everybody at my house.

00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:00.220
It was like this twisted
Christmas morning.

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:02.960
Everyone in their matching
polar bear pajamas.

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:06.060
So now I'm really good
at throwing parties.

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:10.210
And I learned how to not make my
4th of July party really white

00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:11.040
trash.

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:14.550
Because the first year,
it was 105 degrees.

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:18.560
And we have a pool,
and the pool is heated.

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:21.890
And I'm-- because I don't
want to spend the money to put

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:25.750
in a hot tub, I like to leave
the pool like 95 degrees

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:27.990
so it's nice when you sit in it.

00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:31.990
But I forgot to turn it off
so the air was 105 degrees

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:34.050
and the water was 105 degrees.

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:36.440
so you jump in the water,
and there was like no relief.

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:39.840
It was just liquid hot.

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:43.970
So I mean everybody was just
terribly, terribly dehydrated.

00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:47.250
So my husband came up with this
thing called the Dew Driver,

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:49.460
which is Mountain Dew and vodka.

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:51.610
And everyone was drinking
these enormous tumblers

00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:55.120
of Mountain Dew and vodka,
so it was so white trash.

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.580
It was so bad.

00:28:57.580 --> 00:28:58.650
But it was a lot of fun.

00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:01.370
So I took what worked
from that party

00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:03.730
and I have applied
it to other things.

00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:06.920
I'm not cooking that much
now because the big thing now

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:12.200
is furniture, which is
completely esoteric.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.440
Since I still listen to
Martha Stewart on the radio--

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:16.680
because like I said, I'm
a little mad at her now,

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:19.830
so I like catching her when
she's not doing things well.

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:22.590
And she had a whole
network on Sirius,

00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:23.990
and now she just has a show.

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:27.500
So she lost her network and
you can just tell she's mad.

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:29.880
She just met every
time she's on the show,

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:32.670
and it clearly overlaps
with her lunchtime.

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:34.860
So when she's on the
show, a lot of times

00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:37.167
you can hear her
eating her lunch.

00:29:37.167 --> 00:29:38.750
And she's not even
try to disguise it.

00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:39.510
She doesn't care.

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:41.720
She so does not care.

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:44.680
So this one kid called in.

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:47.080
It was right before the 4th
of July, this last year.

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:49.620
And he had really high voice,
and his name was Thomas

00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:51.380
and she was mad
at him because she

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:52.910
was convinced he was a girl.

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:54.194
So she was just mean to him.

00:29:54.194 --> 00:29:55.610
She was just mean
to this poor kid

00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:58.340
who just wanted to do fun
games with this family for 4th

00:29:58.340 --> 00:29:59.510
of July.

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:01.570
So she's already in a
mood, eating her lunch

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:05.590
angrily-- talking, yelling at
kids for having high voices.

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:08.000
And the next person that called
in was this college girl.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.999
And this college girl
said, I'm looking for ways

00:30:09.999 --> 00:30:12.890
to make my first college
apartment fun, cute and neat.

00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:17.896
And Martha's advice-- why
don't you shop at Pottery Barn?

00:30:17.896 --> 00:30:21.420
Bitch, that's where my
nice stuff come from.

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:24.420
And then she remembered,
that oh yeah, Macy's pays me.

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:26.430
Or go to Macy's,
that was her advice.

00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:28.490
And that made me angry.

00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:30.325
Because I worked for
a really long time

00:30:30.325 --> 00:30:32.200
to be able to buy my
stuff from Pottery Barn,

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:34.170
and it made me mad that
she thought that-- then

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:36.128
it made me mad that
college kids maybe actually

00:30:36.128 --> 00:30:36.840
could shop there.

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:39.200
So I thought, how would
I have answered this?

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.799
Because I like to guess
her questions sometime.

00:30:41.799 --> 00:30:42.840
Like how would I do this?

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:45.006
And I had heard about this
stuff called chalk paint,

00:30:45.006 --> 00:30:47.894
and it's like you can paint
over furniture without sanding,

00:30:47.894 --> 00:30:49.060
without priming or anything.

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:51.400
So I got a can of it, and
I started painting things.

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:56.580
And now it's this whole actual
side business that I'm having.

00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:59.850
And I have an art show
in Lake Forest on Friday

00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:01.580
where I have like 40
pieces of furniture

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:04.160
that I've completely like
rescued from dumpsters,

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.075
and yard sales and
I'm going to sell it

00:31:06.075 --> 00:31:09.340
at extremely inflated prices.

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:13.170
I feel like Martha
would approve of that.

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:15.360
It's such a weird way
to get into a business.

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:17.651
It's like, well I was mad at
someone eating their lunch

00:31:17.651 --> 00:31:19.970
on the radio, so now I have
a new line of business.

00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:21.575
But it worked.

00:31:21.575 --> 00:31:23.200
So I mean, that's
really stuck with me.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.940
Like every time I do a book,
and I try to reinvent my life,

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:27.800
not everything sticks.

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:28.970
But some stuff does.

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:31.440
Like a few years ago, I did
this book about culturing up.

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:34.280
And the one thing that really
stuck was going to the opera.

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:37.580
So now I go to the opera like
four or five times a year,

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:43.120
which is not anything I
would ever expect me to do.

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:46.150
So things do stick,
not everything.

00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:47.710
Anything else?

00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:49.356
Anybody else?

00:31:49.356 --> 00:31:49.930
Yes.

00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:51.846
AUDIENCE: Do you plan
on writing another book,

00:31:51.846 --> 00:31:54.800
and it would be a
memoir or a novel?

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.050
JEN LANCASTER: I go both ways.

00:31:56.050 --> 00:31:56.630
I do both.

00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:58.370
I'm actually working on
two different projects.

00:31:58.370 --> 00:31:58.869
Right now.

00:31:58.869 --> 00:32:03.310
One is a bucket list type book
that comes out next spring.

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:05.970
It's called "I Regret Nothing."

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:08.045
And they'll just be a
lot of-- my generation,

00:32:08.045 --> 00:32:11.534
I'm Generation X. The first
members of my generation

00:32:11.534 --> 00:32:12.950
are starting to
turn 50 this year.

00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:15.830
We're in our second
act of our lives.

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:17.540
The things we want
to do, now's the time

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:19.272
to do it before
we are all too old

00:32:19.272 --> 00:32:20.480
or are hips hurt or whatever.

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.917
So I'm going through like
doing bucket list type items.

00:32:22.917 --> 00:32:24.500
Like my husband are
going to Italy for

00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:26.779
the first time in two weeks.

00:32:26.779 --> 00:32:28.570
And I'm going by myself
at first because, I

00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:30.320
want to go to a
different country

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:31.710
and try to speak the language.

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:33.450
I've been taking lessons.

00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:35.120
So that's one of the
things we're doing.

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:38.370
I'm also working on a
couple of different novels.

00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:41.690
So yeah, I always have
something in the hopper.

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:44.120
Because I like to buy stuff.

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:46.034
I started my career
with the book,

00:32:46.034 --> 00:32:47.450
"Bitter is the New
Black" which is

00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:49.530
about us working
during the dot com era.

00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:53.530
So let me tell you how
angry I am being here,

00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:56.936
because I was like 12,
14 years too early.

00:32:56.936 --> 00:32:58.310
They had the razor
scooters then,

00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:00.210
but they didn't have the
infrastructure to support it.

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:02.150
So now that this is
actually successful,

00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:03.540
I feel like I've been gypped.

00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:05.820
Just so you know.

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:08.970
So I have to talk about the
fact that your toilets are not

00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:10.714
the cool Japanese ones.

00:33:10.714 --> 00:33:12.380
But most of the whole
point of that book

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:15.160
was, we kind of lost
everything and then we

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:17.740
reinvented everything, and I
wrote my first book about that.

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:20.619
So now everything after that is
kind of a logical progression.

00:33:20.619 --> 00:33:22.160
Did that make sense
because I kind of

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:23.745
forgot what the question was.

00:33:23.745 --> 00:33:24.911
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:33:24.911 --> 00:33:25.398
JEN LANCASTER: Yes.

00:33:25.398 --> 00:33:27.606
AUDIENCE: Where do you get
the ideas for your novels?

00:33:27.606 --> 00:33:31.550
Like the time travel one, and
then-- the body-swapping one.

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:32.800
JEN LANCASTER: My second book.

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:34.620
My second novel is
called, "Here I Go Again."

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:36.328
It's my favorite thing
I've ever written.

00:33:36.328 --> 00:33:40.340
It's about high school
mean girls, time travel,

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:42.270
and the band Whitesnake.

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:45.447
And it is like the most
critically well-reviewed book

00:33:45.447 --> 00:33:46.030
that I've had.

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:47.905
I've got like starred
reviews from everybody,

00:33:47.905 --> 00:33:49.884
from people who have
previously written

00:33:49.884 --> 00:33:51.300
about wanting to
kick me until I'm

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:54.900
dead because they're not fans.

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:57.450
But part of that was my husband
was planning his high school

00:33:57.450 --> 00:33:58.211
25th reunion.

00:33:58.211 --> 00:34:00.460
Because my husband was like
a big nerd in high school.

00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:01.967
Again, before his time.

00:34:01.967 --> 00:34:04.550
Because he would have been so--
people would've loved him now,

00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:06.580
like with this nerd tendencies.

00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:08.790
So he was planning his
25th high school reunion,

00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:12.340
and he was doing all of
it the way he wanted it.

00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:14.690
He was a committee of one.

00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:18.449
So all he did was talk
about this reunion.

00:34:18.449 --> 00:34:20.659
And it began to
infect my dreams.

00:34:20.659 --> 00:34:23.056
So I started dreaming
about high school reunions.

00:34:23.056 --> 00:34:24.639
And with the first
novel that I wrote,

00:34:24.639 --> 00:34:26.340
I thought I was being so clever.

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:29.573
I made the characters exactly
like my husband and me,

00:34:29.573 --> 00:34:31.239
and I put them in the
same circumstance,

00:34:31.239 --> 00:34:32.949
moving from the
city to the suburbs.

00:34:32.949 --> 00:34:34.110
And I thought I'm a genius.

00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:37.870
Nobody has ever mixed
fact with fiction before.

00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:39.120
You know what, there a reason.

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:40.080
It confuses people.

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:41.670
People don't like it.

00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:43.420
So when I wrote
"Here I Go Again,"

00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:45.850
I wanted to make sure that
no one picked up this book

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:47.966
and said, how come
you and Fletch

00:34:47.966 --> 00:34:49.590
are calling yourselves
Mac and Mia now?

00:34:49.590 --> 00:34:50.889
This doesn't make sense.

00:34:50.889 --> 00:34:53.889
So I want to do something
where no one thought it was me.

00:34:53.889 --> 00:34:57.070
So I came up with
the idea of someone

00:34:57.070 --> 00:34:59.910
traveling-- a high
school mean girl,

00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:03.190
going to her reunion finding
that everybody that she was

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:06.990
so awful to in high school is
really, really successful now,

00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:07.740
and she's not.

00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:10.370
And going back in time
to change herself so she

00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:14.219
could be happy in the
future, with varying results.

00:35:14.219 --> 00:35:16.010
This needs to be a
movie, just so you know.

00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:19.130
If you know anyone,
you let me know.

00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:20.980
And then the one that
I did most recently,

00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:24.000
"Twisted Sisters," it's
about a TV psychologist

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.590
who works on like an "Oprah"
type show where they give

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:31.350
people full makeovers--
like mental and physical.

00:35:31.350 --> 00:35:34.257
But the network buys it, and
she's forced to cut corners.

00:35:34.257 --> 00:35:36.590
And there ends up being a
magical realism where she just

00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:37.950
body swaps with them.

00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:40.880
Just to do the event that
they can get on camera.

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:44.600
And her entire life is just
ruled by sibling rivalry.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.970
Because I had this
thought that-- I

00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:49.530
think having a sister like
having a best friend who

00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:50.415
you hate sometimes.

00:35:50.415 --> 00:35:52.540
And so that was that was
where the theme came from.

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:54.330
I'm always paying
attention though.

00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:56.492
I'm always looking
at what's around me.

00:35:56.492 --> 00:35:57.950
I'm always observing
because I want

00:35:57.950 --> 00:36:00.322
to know what people are doing.

00:36:00.322 --> 00:36:01.655
So then I can still those ideas.

00:36:04.117 --> 00:36:04.700
Anything else?

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:08.367
are we good?

00:36:08.367 --> 00:36:10.700
OK, well thank you guys so
much for coming and listening

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:12.320
and everything.
