00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.103
The answer is luckyNumber is 13, and luckyNumber2 is 12. Let's draw the diagram

00:00:05.103 --> 00:00:08.945
again. luckyNumber is an int, so instead of having a reference, it just

00:00:08.945 --> 00:00:14.440
contains the number itself. So initially, we set it to 13. Then we made

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.438
luckyNumber2 by copying the value of luckyNumber1. Which isn't a reference this

00:00:18.438 --> 00:00:23.726
time. It's just 13. So, luckyNumber2 became 13, then we change the value of

00:00:23.726 --> 00:00:29.630
luckyNumber2. We set it equal to 12 instead of 13. Since this isn't a

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.892
reference, we just reset it to 12, and that's how we get our answer. Again,

00:00:34.892 --> 00:00:42.004
ints aren't objects. Strings are objects. Rectangles are objects. Ints are not

00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:42.860
objects.
