00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.280
Here's an example of a product I think provides a clear

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.920
system image. What if you were in a meeting room or

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.530
cafeteria, where someone was having a heart attack? The room had

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.320
a heart defibrillator on the wall, which you're seeing here. But

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.530
let's say you had never seen or used one before. What

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.040
would you do? Those who designed the device aren't present, no

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.040
medical personnel or trained responders are around, and anxious helpers don't

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.760
have time to read a manual, not even a simple one.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.000
Here's a product where designers have to communicate

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.070
the proper model of operation quickly. So what

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.230
you're seeing here is the solution the design

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.290
firm IDEO came up with for defibrillators. The device

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.050
walks users through three steps, each clearly marked

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.600
and numbered. The screen, visible here, with the

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.300
number two, gives specific instructions as users are

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.800
interacting with the device. And as you can see

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.280
from this diagram, two electrodes needs to be placed on the patient and

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.170
the diagram clearly communicates where they need

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.510
to be placed. It's pretty straight forward.
