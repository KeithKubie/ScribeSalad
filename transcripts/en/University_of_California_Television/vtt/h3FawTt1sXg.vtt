bipedal, naked large-brained. Lone the

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:38.670
master of fire, tools and language, but
still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:48.660
Aware that death is inevitable, yet filled
with optimism. We grow up slowly. We hand

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:56.150
down knowledge. We empathize and deceive.
We shape the future from our shared

- [Christina] Thank you so much. It's such
a pleasure to be here. I'm going to be

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.250
talking about some other genomes that
contribute to what makes us human. This

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.070
may look like a photograph of outer space,
but these pinpoints of light are not

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.120
stars. They're in fact the glowing genomes
of millions of bacterial cells on the

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.240
surface of human teeth. This is dental
plaque. The human body contains an

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:33.800
estimated 30 trillion human cells and by
the latest estimate, 40 trillion bacterial

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.450
cells. And so, if you add these two
numbers up together you will find that we

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:43.540
are more than 50% bacterial. 40 trillion
bacterial cells is an incredible number

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.430
and at an average length of just over one
micron, if you were to line them up, just

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.010
the ones in your own body alone, end to
end, they would actually wrap around the

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.660
entire Earth and span more than 20,000
miles. 40 trillion bacterial cells is

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.810
truly an astronomical number and even this
fails to capture the immensity of this

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.250
number because there are only about 300
billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy. And

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.220
so, the number of bacteria in and on your
body actually exceed the number of stars

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.980
in more than 100 galaxies. At this point
you may be wondering how you appear human

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.810
at all and the answer is that, although
numerous, these bacteria are also very

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.930
small; on average they're 1,000 times
smaller than a human cell. When you add

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.520
them all up together, they make up about
2% of your body weight or roughly 1.5

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.840
kilograms. That's a really interesting
number because that's about the same

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.570
weight as your brain and your liver. Some
have argued that we should start to think

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.900
of the microbiome as an additional organ
system. Most of these bacteria are

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.360
concentrated in the gut and specifically
in the distal colon. And in feces, they're

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.300
actually concentrated to an extraordinary
degree. There are over a 100 billion

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.480
viable bacterial cells per gram of feces.
And so, if you follow math through that

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.860
means with each trip to the toilet you
actually lose 20% of your total body

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:06.610
cells. But don't worry, you regenerate
them very quickly after your next meal. In

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.980
addition to the gut, a smaller but also
very important fraction of your microbiome

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.540
lives within your oral cavity and there
they inhabit the buccal mucosa, the

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.290
surface of the tongue, and the surfaces of
your teeth where they're called dental

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.930
plaque. Now, the oral microbiome actually
plays a very important role in the history

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.880
of microbiology because the first
undisputed description of bacteria comes

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.060
from a letter written by Antony van
Leeuwenhoek to the Royal Society of

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.600
London, approximately 300 years ago, in
which he described, "very many small

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.030
animals which moved themselves very
extravagantly within his dental plaque."

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.990
He drew many of these organisms and he
tried to count them but he eventually gave

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.240
up and he wrote, "the number of these
animals in the scurf of man's teeth are so

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.660
numerous that I believe they exceed the
number of men in a kingdom." Now, if

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.520
anything, this is a gross understatement
because we now know that there are nearly

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.160
as many bacteria on the surface of your
teeth as there are humans on Earth and

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:09.540
each day you swallow an average of 80
billion bacteria in your saliva. So in

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.550
addition to being numerous, these bacteria
also contain an immense diversity of

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:20.550
genes. On average, there are about a 150
times more genes in your microbiome than

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:26.420
in your human genome. This bacterial
genome is so large that it's often

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:32.080
referred to as your accessory genome and
in fact, you require these genes in order

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.460
to perform some of your most basic human
life functions. This has led some to

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.170
describe the relationship between humans
and their microbes as that of a super

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:46.100
organism like a colony of bees, many
independent organisms contributing

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.680
together, or more recently, as a
holobiont, an ecosystem so tightly

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.470
interdependent that it behaves as a single
organism like coral. Rather than just

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.650
being a leaf on the great tree of life, in
some ways humans are actually more like a

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:04.720
tree house; a home woven from many
permanent and transient microbial

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.970
inhabitants. Yet, we have only very
recently come to even notice this large

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.970
number of under explored, and mostly
nameless, microorganisms that inhabit the

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:18.840
human body. In fact, it was only in 2001
that Joshua Lederberg coined the term

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.720
"microbiome" in order to "...signify the
ecological community of commensal,

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.380
symbiotic, and pathogenic microorganisms
that literally share our body space and

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:32.850
have been all but ignored as determinants
of health and disease." This is rather

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:38.910
remarkable because these microbial
communities perform essential major

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:43.390
functions within their host bodies that
include various aspects of digestion;

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:48.180
vitamin production and drug metabolism;
education of the immune system; and

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:52.080
defense against pathogens. But the
microbiome can also be a source of

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:57.160
infectious agents for example, the oral
microbiome is the natural reservoir for

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.300
numerous respiratory opportunistic
pathogens that are responsible for

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:05.950
infections ranging from pneumonia to
meningitis. The oral and gut microbiomes

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:08.980
have been implicated in several chronic
inflammatory diseases including

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:15.150
cardiovascular disease where in a recent
study it was found that more than 80% of

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:20.330
diseased valve and arterial tissues
contain oral bacteria. So the microbiome

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.900
clearly plays a pivotal role in human
biology, and therefore, it is critical to

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:28.220
understand its evolution and changing
ecology through time. One way we can do

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:32.460
this is we can investigate the ancestral
human microbiome by directly measuring and

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:37.340
analyzing it from archaeological material.
Now ancient DNA studies have long focused

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:42.430
on the analysis of the bones and teeth.
And we've made major advancements studying

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:47.340
these tissues. And we've been able to, for
example, recover host and pathogen DNA and

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:52.860
reconstruct the entire genomes of extinct
animals, archaic humans, and even ancient

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:57.310
pathogens. But studying the microbiome has
been very challenging. The human body

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:02.090
decays rapidly after death. In some cases,
mummification can occur but in the vast

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:06.690
majority of instances, we are left with
only a skeleton. But there is one

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:11.780
microbiome that routinely persists after
death and that is something called dental

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:16.760
calculus. This is a...what it essentially
is is dental plaque that has spontaneously

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.650
calcified during life, you know this by
the name tartar which is what your dentist

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:26.090
calls it. It calcifies during life...in a
way it actually is the only part of your

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:31.150
body that fossilizes while you're still
alive and therefore, persists, like your

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:36.780
skeleton, long after death. This is just a
close-up image of dental calculus; you can

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:39.770
kind of see what it is. If you're
wondering what this looks like in a living

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:43.850
person, here's an image here. This is
calcified microbial matrix on the surface

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:48.170
of teeth. This particular example is from
a woman who died approximately 1,000 years

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:51.980
ago. We can take a...we can zoom in on
this particular tooth here, and here I've

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.880
just shown that same tooth now in
cross-section using scanning electron

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.620
microscopy. We can zoom in on this
calculus deposit that you can see on the

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.890
surface of the enamel; there it is right
there. We're going to zoom in, again, on

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:04.930
this part right here and one of the things
that's very clear immediately is that it

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:09.280
has structure, it has a layered structure.
That is because dental calculus forms

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:14.140
incrementally. Dental plaque undergoes
spontaneous calcification which kills the

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:18.420
microorganisms inside but also entombs
them. Then, another layer of dental plaque

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:22.490
forms and this process repeats and, over
time, it builds up layers like tree rings

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:27.120
or layers of an onion. What's really
significant about this is what it means is

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:32.450
that we have an ordered record of this
person's life history from the earliest

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:36.110
period, closest to the surface of the
teeth, to the latest period of their life

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:40.910
just before they died. This structure
never remodels and therefore, is a

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:45.650
remarkable record of this person's life
history. We can zoom in even further and

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:50.830
actually see the individual microbial
cells that have been calcified in situ. We

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:56.440
can also decalcify it and use stains like
gram stain to visualize these bacteria.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:00.590
Remarkably, when you remove the mineral,
the bacteria do not disintegrate. And in

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:04.750
fact, you can see individual microbial
cells here. So, these are individual gram

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:11.120
positive bacteria, for example, here still
with cell wall intact. What to me was most

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.170
remarkable is we tried, kind of on a lark
we didn't think it would work, we decided

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:18.820
to use another stain, in this case Hooke's
dye which is very similar to dot B [sp] if

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:23.970
you've ever used that, it's a DNA dye, it
binds to double-stranded DNA. This is the

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:27.570
image we got after that which you saw in
the beginning. This is the only

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:31.880
archeological material that I know to
exist that has so much DNA inside that you

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:35.760
can actually see it under a microscope.
This property turns out to be pretty

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:40.490
remarkable for calculus. If we're going to
use by comparison, let's just sort of talk

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:43.620
a little about bone and dentin, those are
the tissues that are most commonly

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:48.430
studied. They actually have very little
DNA inside, even when a person is alive.

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:52.270
So, bone, for example, has fewer than
1,000 cells per milligram, it's almost

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:56.890
acellular. We have, typically in
archeological context, we recover very

00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:00.740
little DNA; typically, less than a
nanogram of DNA per milligram that we

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:07.340
study. Even that is mostly environmental
bacteria that have invaded postmortem.

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:11.700
Here's just some data we've generated in
my own lab. We looked at four teeth from

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.480
different parts of the world, different
time periods, and we looked to see what

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:19.490
the endogenous content was of dentin. What
we find is that only a tiny fraction of

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:25.500
that DNA is actually human, most of it,
the vast majority, is postmortem

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:29.300
environmental bacteria that are
decomposing the teeth. On average, we get

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:35.610
something like 0.1 to 8% human DNA; so,
very very low amounts of endogenous DNA.

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:40.110
Calculus is completely different. First
off, it starts off with far more cells. On

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:44.480
average, it has more than 200 million
cells per milligram. In our lab we've

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:51.540
isolated in excess of 500 nanograms of DNA
per milligram we've studied. What's also

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:55.860
really remarkable is we have very low
contamination from environmental sources.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:59.250
These are the same teeth, but now we've
analyzed the calculus from them and what

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:03.580
you can see is the endogenous content, the
oral microbiome per portion is much much

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:09.020
higher, it's on the order of 60 to 80%. We
can look then at pairs, again, of calculus

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:12.530
and dentin and we can see the amount of
DNA that we can recover, this is a

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:17.480
logarithmic scale, is on average about two
orders of magnitude higher; nearly 100

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:22.430
times more DNA in calculus than in dentin,
in some cases, 1,000 times higher. We

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:26.230
thought in the beginning this might be
just because it starts off with more DNA

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:30.030
so we decided to test this. We took a
tooth that was very diseased, it had a

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:34.190
massive carious lesion and also a giant
abscess, this would have had tons of

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:38.200
bacterial DNA, tons of bacteria at the
time this person died and we expected we

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:42.000
might see elevated levels of DNA from
these samples. In fact, we don't. We find

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.510
they're almost the same as what we see for
healthy dentin. That seems to imply that

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:49.310
there's something special about calculus
that facilitates DNA preservation. We can

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:54.130
then actually go in and say, "What do we
find in calculus? This is an amazing

00:12:54.130 --> 00:13:00.250
structure, it's full of DNA, what sorts of
information can we learn from it?" We can

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:03.740
break it down into different categories
and we can say "Well, about 99% of it is

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:08.070
bacterial." That makes sense. We know this
is made of dental plaque. Dental plaque is

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:13.960
primarily a microbial matrix, but about 1%
is quite interesting. We have a little bit

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.450
more than a half a percent which is
eukaryotic, that's mostly host and

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:22.280
dietary. We also find a tiny bit archaea
and a little bit of virus. The virus is

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:28.220
actually bacteriophage which are viruses
that infect bacteria. We can also extract

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:32.740
proteins from dental calculus. We can also
classify them. What we find is about 80%

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:37.420
of the proteins are bacterial in origin
and about 20% are human. I'll come back to

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:41.870
that in just a few minutes. Let's focus on
the bacteria first. We've identified more

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:47.920
than 1,000 species, but the vast majority,
more than 85% of the sequences, bacterial

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:52.280
sequences, that we find actually belong to
100 highly abundant taxa and some of them

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:56.390
are very interesting. Here's just a
selection of some of the bacteria that

00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:59.890
we've identified in dental calculus,
ancient dental calculus. I mentioned

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:04.630
earlier that the oral microbiome is a
major reservoir for opportunistic

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:09.820
infections. We find many of these bacteria
preserved in dental calculus. I want to

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:13.700
caution here that finding them does not
indicate this person had this disease

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:17.350
while they were alive. Carriage of these
organisms is quite widespread, even

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:22.430
asymptomatic carriage, but these bacteria
have the capacity to cause disease under

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:26.210
the right circumstances, for example, if
the host is immunocompromised. What's

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:29.990
really significant about this is it gives
us the opportunity to study the evolution

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:34.120
of these opportunistic pathogens because
they do not preserve in any other context

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:38.600
and some of them are very interesting. So,
for example, Streptococcus pneumoniae is a

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:42.640
causative agent of pneumonia.
Streptococcus pyogenes that's one of the

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:47.280
causes of strep throat. Haemophilus
influenzae causes respiratory infections

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:51.260
and Neisseria meningitides is a leading
cause of bacterial meningitis. Now, we

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.370
have a reliable source to study the
evolution of these opportunistic

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:58.890
pathogens. A couple others that we found
extremely interesting are these three, a

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:02.710
little bit lesser known. We have here
Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:07.020
forsythia, and Treponema denticola. We
have them at really high abundance and

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:11.100
this is potentially clinically significant
because these are the major causative

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:15.100
agents of periodontal disease today. We
investigated this a little further, we

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:20.090
wanted to know did our ancient samples
have unusually high abundances of these

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:24.400
three taxa. What we did is we compared it
to a reference set of healthy individuals

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.980
from the Human Microbiome Project. We
found that the frequency of these

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:34.980
organisms within healthy individuals are
vanishingly small. Very very few copies of

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:38.690
these bacteria are present in healthy
people, but our ancient individuals had

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:44.840
much higher frequencies of these bacteria.
This did make sense, however, because we'd

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.260
actually selected these individuals for
study because they showed osteological

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.980
evidence for periodontal disease. What was
interesting about this is we were able to

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:56.810
show that despite a century of intensive
efforts to prophylactically treat

00:15:56.810 --> 00:16:00.400
periodontal disease and prevent it, we
still see the same organisms that are

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:04.590
causing it over a span of more than 1,000
years. Now, one of these organisms,

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:08.020
Tannerella forsythia, we actually found at
such high abundance that we were able to

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:11.840
reconstruct a full draft genome. We're now
investigating it to try to understand the

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:16.520
evolution of this pathogen through time.
In addition to the bacteria that are

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:20.370
present, I mentioned before that we do
find some really interesting other

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:25.250
material there. Tt turns out dental
calculus, like dental plaque, acts as a

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:30.550
kind of sink for all the other things that
you put into your mouth; including, host

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:36.070
biomolecules, as well as food. Talk really
quickly about the host. Early on we

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:40.290
noticed that we were seeing human DNA
within dental calculus, this was really

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:44.000
interesting to us. We just published a
study last month where using a capture

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.870
based approach, we were able to enrich for
human DNA and reconstruct full

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:54.350
mitochondrial genomes, in this case, from
a cemetery, Native American cemetery from

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:58.180
Illinois. This is potentially, actually,
quite impactful especially in North

00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:03.850
America there are many tribes who do not
allow genetic analysis of skeletal remains

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:07.910
because it is a destructive process. If
dental calculus can serve as a surrogate,

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:13.020
it may be a way of conducting ancient
genetic analysis without disturbing the

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:17.140
actual skeletal remains themselves. We
also find a huge abundance of human

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:22.180
proteins within dental calculus; this is
where it gets extremely interesting. Most

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:26.700
of these proteins, I've color-coded them
by sort of what their function is, most of

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:31.320
these proteins are colored red and that's
because they are part of the innate immune

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:35.710
system. What's interesting about this is
that by having proteins we get an

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:40.100
additional level of information. We are
not only identifying that we have human

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:44.010
proteins, but many of these proteins are
specifically expressed in different cell

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:47.710
types. In this case, many of them are
specific to neutrophils. So we can

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:53.650
identify the source of these proteins as a
specific immune cell that's reacting to

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:58.260
dental calculus. So what we're actually
visualizing here is evidence of an active

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:03.070
infection at the time of death. In terms
of diet, it's long been known that

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:06.820
microfossils, plant microfossils and
animals microfossil, preserve within

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:11.670
dental calculus. So, all that little bits
of food that get stuck between your teeth,

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:14.900
they actually stick around for a really
long time and we can see them under the

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:18.690
microscope. What you're looking at here,
this is a little bit of connective tissue

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:21.460
from some sort of animal tissue this
person ate. This is a Phyta Life, it's a

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:26.200
little piece of plant glass. These two
here are actually intact starch granules.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.310
This one, the morphology is consistent
with the plant tribe Tricaceae which

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:33.550
includes things like wheat and barley.
This one has characteristic structures of

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:38.710
the plant family Fabaceae which includes
things like peas and beans. We can also

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:43.640
extract DNA from this and get even higher
species level resolution. This particular

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:50.310
tooth came from a man who lived in Germany
about 1,000 years ago when in his teeth we

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:54.900
found evidence of sheep, pigs, cabbage,
and wheat. Therefore, conclusively

00:18:54.900 --> 00:19:00.760
demonstrated the German diet has not
changed much in more than 900 years. We

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:05.340
can also isolate proteins from dental
calculus to investigate diet. One of the

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:10.290
most interesting ones that we have found
so far is one called Beta-lactoglobulin.

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:14.470
Beta-lactoglobulin is specific to milk and
as a result, we've now been able to test

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:19.970
more than 100 individuals and identify the
presence of dairy throughout Europe dating

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:23.760
back to at least the Bronze Age. We
published these results last year. We're

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:28.390
building on them now. Our goal in the next
phase of this project is to try to

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:32.870
understand the origins and spread of dairy
in the Middle East and Europe. What's also

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:36.550
amazing about proteins and using this
approach is that because it's sequence

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:39.740
based, there are sequence variants that
are species specific. We can actually

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:44.040
distinguish cattle milk, sheep milk, and
goat milk and have a very fine scale

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:50.300
resolution of how these dietary practices
changed. If you'll pardon my pun, I think

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:54.580
we've only scratched the surface of where
we can go with dental calculus analysis.

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:59.040
One of the most exciting things that I
find about it is that, is it's ubiquity.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:03.090
So, dental calculus is found in all
living, in all known living populations

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:08.360
today and we find it ubiquitously in
skeletal assemblages from the past. It's

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:12.500
also found on Neandertal teeth and the
teeth of Ostropreozines, it's actually

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:16.890
quite abundant on chimpanzee teeth as
well. And I think by studying it, it can

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:22.060
provide a unique window, a lens through
which we can better begin to understand

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:29.110
the evolution of our ancient microbial
self. Thank you very much. I'd like to

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:30.524
thank these people.
