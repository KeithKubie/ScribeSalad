00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:00.920
All right.

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:02.960
I re-read the question,
and now I realize

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.540
the error in my logic.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.350
I misread the question.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.440
I had misread it and I said,
oh, there are 60 siblings.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.300
No, there are 60
sibling pairs.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.853
So that means in each class
there-- so 60 siblings pairs,

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:21.480
that means there are
120 siblings.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.760
But that tells us that in each
class there aren't 30, there

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.310
are 60 members of a sibling
group, right?

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.700
So let's go back through
our logic again.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.350
Let's say I pick someone from
the junior class first. What

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.920
is the probability that
I even pick someone

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:35.965
from a sibling pair?

00:00:35.965 --> 00:00:41.810
That's going to be 60/1,000,
which is the same thing as

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.910
6/100, which is the same
thing as 3/50, right?

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:47.360
Fair enough.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.890
So there's a 3 in 50 chance that
I pick someone who's a

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.650
member of a sibling pair.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.340
Now, in order for me to have a
complete sibling pair when I

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.900
go to the senior class and pick
someone, I have to pick

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.760
this junior sibling, and that
junior only has 1 sibling in

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.980
the senior class.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.670
So there's only a 1
in 800 chance that

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:05.560
I pick their sibling.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.060
It doesn't matter that-- the
other 59 siblings in that are

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.380
useless, because they're
not this guy's sibling.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.950
So I have a 1 in 800 chance
of doing that.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.360
You multiply them,
you get 3/40,000.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.260
And that's choice A.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.380
If you don't see your choice,
make sure to read

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.042
the question again.

00:01:24.042 --> 00:01:28.780
Almost out of space so let
me clear all of this.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.610
Let me clear all of that.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:38.190
And we're on problem 218.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.350
Which of the following cannot
be the median of the three

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.940
positive integers x, y, and z?

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.100
So the median, the
middle number.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.310
They say A is x.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.030
Well, no, that's not true.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.390
What if this was the order?
x y, z, then x

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.330
would be the median.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.760
So it's not A.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.800
B, z .

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.420
No reason why z can't
be the median.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.910
The order can be y, z, x.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.080
It's not B.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.565
C, x plus z.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:15.456
Well, let's see, could x
plus z be the median?

00:02:15.456 --> 00:02:19.570
x plus z, could that
be the median?

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.130
Let me think about it.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:31.380
If we have x, z, and y, I mean,
by definition one of

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.180
these numbers has to
be the median.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.060
We have three numbers,
one of them has to

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.350
be the middle number.

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.230
Under what circumstances--
because x plus-- I mean, if x

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.440
plus z is the median, that
implies that neither x nor z

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.390
is the median, right?

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.720
Do they tell us that
those are-- right,

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.690
they're positive integers.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.180
None of these are zero.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.470
So in order for x plus z to be
the median, that tells us that

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.400
neither x nor z is the
median, right?

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.390
And if neither x nor z
is the median, then y

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.750
has to be the median.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.340
And then that tells us that x
plus z has to be equal to y.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.190
But if y is the median, the
order is this: x, y, z.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.530
And there's no way that I can
add x and z and get a smaller

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.430
number than z, because
all of these numbers

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.310
are positive, right?

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.110
Yeah, they said three
positive integers.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.370
So I go with choice C.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.440
That cannot happen.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.040
The median cannot be x plus z.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.980
Problem 219.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.050
What is the 25th digit to the
right of the decimal point in

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.120
the decimal form of 6/11?

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.340
And whenever they ask you for
something ridiculous, there

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.990
must be some type of pattern we
can exploit to figure out

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.310
what the 25th digit is.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.910
Let's just start dividing.

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.740
11 goes into 6, so we're
going to have to have

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.680
some decimals there.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.230
11 goes into 60 five times.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.520
5 times 11 is 55,
and remainder 5.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.740
And you're going to
50, you get a 4.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.800
4 times-- I already see
the pattern-- 44.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.850
Oh no, never mind.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.910
Wait, let me make sure
that's right.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.149
55, you get 50 remainder, 11
goes into 50 four times.

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:17.620
You get 40.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.329
So then you get 60.

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.910
11 goes into 60 five times,
and you repeat

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.000
so on and so forth.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.490
I just want to make sure.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.130
Let's see, the first digit
to the right is 25.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.000
The second digit to
the right is 4.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.730
The third digit to
the right is 5.

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.080
And so, you know, we
could keep going.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.010
The fourth digit to
the right is 4.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.170
So every odd digit to the
right of this is what?

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.880
It's 5.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.530
So they want to know the 25th
digit to the right, and that's

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.170
an odd number, 25.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.940
So it has to be 5 as well.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.750
So that's choice C.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.000
Next question.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.060
Oh, I thought I had
to erase that.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:03.410
OK, question 220.

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.690
John and Mary were each paid x
dollars in advance to do a

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.610
certain job together.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:09.460
Fair enough.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.100
John worked on the job for 10
hours, so John worked 10

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.540
hours, and Mary worked 2
hours less than John.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.450
So Mary worked 8 hours, right?

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.100
John worked on the job for 10
hours and Mary worked for 2

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.190
hours less than John, so
she worked 8 hours.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.470
If Mary gave y dollars of her
payment so that they would

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.860
have received the same hourly
wage, what was the dollar

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:37.130
amount in terms of y that John
was paid in advance?

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.310
OK, John and Mary were each paid
x dollars in advance to

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.310
do a certain job together.

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.400
OK, so how much money did they--
so John got x dollars

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.210
and Mary got x dollars.

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.770
They both got x dollars,
right?

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.150
So if you think about
it, let's ignore

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:57.440
who did what, right?

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.100
We had how many total
hours of labor?

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:05.190
We had 18 hours of labor,
and they were

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.300
paid how many dollars?

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:18.040
They were paid 2x dollars
for 18 hours of labor.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:23.970
So the average wage should be--
you could kind of do it

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.375
the fair-- you know, per hourly
wage should be-- let's

00:06:27.375 --> 00:06:31.330
see, we could divide by 9, you
get a 1 and you get a 9.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:38.180
You get x/9 dollars per hour.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:47.920
That's the fair way.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:48.830
So let me re-read
the question.

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.440
If Mary gave John y dollars of
her payment so that they would

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.180
have had the same hourly wage,
what was the dollar amount in

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:59.480
terms of y that John was
paid in advance?

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.300
Actually, let's think
of it this way.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.280
So Mary pays John-- let
me ignore this.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.190
I just thought of a better
way of doing it.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:09.380
So they were each paid
x hours in advance to

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:09.930
do a certain job.

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.830
John worked on the job for 10
hours and Mary worked 2 hours

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:13.960
less than John.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.490
If Mary paid John y dollars of
her payment so that they would

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:21.150
have received the same hourly
wage-- so after Mary pays John

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:25.390
y, what-- so that means John got
a total of y dollars and

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:29.560
Mary has paid y dollars.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:35.060
So now John has x plus y, and
Mary has x minus y dollars.

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.880
And so, if Mary paid of her
payment so that they would

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.580
receive the same hourly wage,
what was the dollar amount in

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:45.280
terms of y that John was
paid in advance?

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:51.290
So let me think about
this a little bit.

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:55.340
So they got the same-- they
received the same hourly wage.

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:03.930
So Mary should have 8/10 the
money of John, right?

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:13.581
So x minus y should be equal
to 0.8 times x plus y.

00:08:13.581 --> 00:08:16.140
Am I thinking about that right
or is there an easier way to

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:17.570
think about it?

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:18.510
Well, let's think about
it this way.

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:22.270
John worked 2 hours more
than Mary, right?

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:31.360
So Mary, essentially, if she
pays him for 1 hour-- no,

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.260
yeah, this is the right thing.
x minus y is equal to 0.8

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.880
times x plus y, but I'm
going to still end

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:37.760
up with an x here.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:49.040
So you get x minus y is equal
to 0.8x plus 0.8y, right?

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.900
And all the logic here I just
said is-- well, Mary's total

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:55.395
money, if we're going to be
fair, should be 0.8 of John's

00:08:55.395 --> 00:08:58.810
total money, because she worked
0.8 as much hours.

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:00.370
And so, let's see.

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:02.575
Oh, actually, they want to know
what John was paid in

00:09:02.575 --> 00:09:03.680
advance, so that's x.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:04.860
So actually, OK, we're fine.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.000
So they just want to know
what x is in terms of y.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:07.710
So we're cool.

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:10.320
So let's subtract 0.8x
from both sides.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:17.120
So you get 0.2x minus
y is equal to 0.8y.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.180
And then add y to both sides.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:22.990
You get 0.2x is equal to 1.8y.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.410
And then multiply both sides by
5, you get x is equal to--

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:31.250
what is that?

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:34.220
5 times 18 is 50 plus 40.

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:37.450
Add a decimal point is
90 is equal to 9y.

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:39.310
And that is choice E

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:41.120
I got a little confused with
the wording of it when they

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.530
say what was the dollar amount
in terms of y that John was

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:44.820
paid in advance?

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:46.920
They should've said

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.560
Sorry for bumbling through
that problem.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.430
