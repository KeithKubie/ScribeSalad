00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.700
Let's start allowing the ports
we know we'll need for

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.360
the applications our
server will be supporting.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.550
First and foremost we know
we'll need to support SSH so

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.620
we can continue
administering this server.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.140
Normally you would do this by
typing sudo ufw allow ssh and

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.430
you can go ahead and do that now.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.090
But remember, we're using
a Vagrant virtual machine and

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.400
Vagrant set up our SSH on Port 2222.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.890
So we'll need to allow all TCP
connections through Port 2222 for

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.640
SSH to actually work
in our scenario here.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.080
For now, the only other application we
plan to support is a basic HTTP server,

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.811
so we can allow this by
using sudo ufw allow www.

00:00:43.811 --> 00:00:49.120
And with that, we can now enable
our firewall with sudo ufw enable.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.220
This step here can be
a little hair raising,

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.250
because our SSH connection is reliant
upon these rules being correct.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.590
If all of a sudden you lose your
SSH connection to your server,

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.250
it's a pretty clear indicator that
you messed up some of your rules.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.760
Some cloud providers do offer a way
to regain access to your system

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.050
through an external control panel.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.260
But many others,
you're just out of luck at this point.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.160
For this reason,
I recommend configuring your firewall

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.030
pretty early in
the server setup process.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.290
Finally, we can confirm all of our
rules are set up as we indicated

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.600
by using the sudo ufw status command.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.290
We'll see all of our rules here and
that our firewall is currently active.
