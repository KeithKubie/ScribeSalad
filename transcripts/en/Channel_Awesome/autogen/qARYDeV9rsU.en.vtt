00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540
I think the script was the biggest
 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.540
I think the script was the biggest
failure of this movie if the script was

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550
failure of this movie if the script was
 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.340
failure of this movie if the script was
written better if the villain was

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350

written better if the relationship

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520
written better if the relationship
 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.850
written better if the relationship
between him and his fiancee were written

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860
between him and his fiancee were written
 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.910
between him and his fiancee were written
better it none of the relationships were

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:13.920
better it none of the relationships were
 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.840
better it none of the relationships were
written really well

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.160
well none of it was written well except
for the relationship between Eddie Brock

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.170
for the relationship between Eddie Brock
 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:23.930
for the relationship between Eddie Brock
and venom and I think a lot of that has

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940
and venom and I think a lot of that has
 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.270
and venom and I think a lot of that has
to do with Tom Hardy I think that that's

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280
to do with Tom Hardy I think that that's
 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.220

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:28.230
where he really shined is where the
 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:29.720
where he really shined is where the
movie really shine is the relationship

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:29.730
movie really shine is the relationship
 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.310

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.490
there's a bunch of cars chasing Eddie
Brock and then venom and the only

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500
Brock and then venom and the only
 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.990
Brock and then venom and the only
interesting parts of the whole chase is

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000
interesting parts of the whole chase is
 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.930
interesting parts of the whole chase is
a long chase it's just not interesting

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940
a long chase it's just not interesting

to venom on his bike when venom was

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810
to venom on his bike when venom was
 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.120
to venom on his bike when venom was
helping him out and there was some

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130
helping him out and there was some
 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.100
