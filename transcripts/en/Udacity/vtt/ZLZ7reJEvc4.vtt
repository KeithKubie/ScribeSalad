00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.110
Alright, we've shown you how to load some data

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.230
into pandas from a CSV file. Now, let's see if

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.930
you can load a csv into python and manipulate the

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.220
data in a basic way. What we've provided here is

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.720
the skeleton of a function called add full name, which

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:19.760
takes in two arguments, path_to_csv and path_to_new_csv. Assume you'll be

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.030
reading in a CSV file with the same columns as

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.590
the Lahman baseball data set. Most importantly, there are columns

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.460
called, nameFirst and nameLast. Write a function that

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.470
reads the CSV located at path_to_csv into a

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.130
pandas dataframe, and then adds a new column

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.470
called nameFull, with that player's full name. For example,

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.940
in the row corresponding to Hank Aaron, nameFull

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.070
would be Hank Aaron. After that, write the

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.970
data in the Pandas dataFrame to a new

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.090
CSV, located at path_to_new_csv. Your code should go here.
