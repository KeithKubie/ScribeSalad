00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.420
Let's do some more practice
word problems.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.600
Patricia is building a sand
box for her daughter.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.470
It is to be 5 feet wide
and 8 feet long.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.140
So let me draw that.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.740
So the 5 feet wide-- it
is to be 5 feet wide.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:18.330
So there you go.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.690
That's 5 feet right there.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.640
And 8 feet long.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.500
I'll do that in orange.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.490
8 feet long.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:26.850
So this is like if we're
looking down

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:27.770
into the sand box.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.860
8 feet long.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.100
So the sand box, if we're
looking down on it, would look

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.810
something like that.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.120
That would be 5 feet.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.210
And this side over here
would also be 8 feet.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.980
All right, she wants the height
of the sand box to be 4

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.130
inches above the height
of the sand.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.500
OK.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.870
So if we were to draw the sand
box like this-- so if you were

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.200
to draw it-- so that's 8.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.310
That distance right
there is 5 feet.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.400
And then there is some height,
which I think we're going to

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.320
have to figure out.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.750
Let me draw the whole
box just like that.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.820
The sand is going to
fill a certain

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.380
amount of the sand box.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.250
So the sand is going to fill
maybe until right over there.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.180
So that's how much the sand is
going to fill of the sand box.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.040
All of that is sand.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.340
And she wants the height of the
sand box to be 4 inches

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.000
above the height of the sand.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.010
So she wants this distance right
here, the amount that

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.350
the height goes above the sand,
itself, to be 4 inches--

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.440
or a third of a foot, depending
how you want to

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.760
think about it.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.460
Now she has 30 cubic
feet of sand.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.220
She has 30 cubic feet of sand.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.810
So this sand right here
is 30 feet cubed.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.890
How high should the
sand box be?

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.370
So this information right here,
the volume of the sand,

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.100
tells us, using it, we can
figure out how high the level

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.520
of the sand will be.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.130
Let's do it this way.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.600
Let's call l-- let
me just use x.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.200
Let's say x is the height
of the sand.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.200
x is equal to height of sand.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.990
So the total volume of our sand
is going to be the height

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.600
of the sand times the
length of the box.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.980
Times 8 times the width
of the box.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.440
Times 5.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.590
And this is going to be the
total volume which they told

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.430
us is 30 cubic feet.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.560
It is 30 cubic feet.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.520
We're taking x feet times
8 feet times 5 feet.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.900
So we'll get 30 feet cubed
if we were to keep

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.380
track of the units.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.050
So what is this?

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.580
8 times 5 is 40.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.250
So we get 40x is equal to 30.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.440
If we divide both sides by
40-- both sides of the

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.470
equation by 40--
let me do that.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.730
You divide both sides by 40, you
get x is equal to-- that

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:06.565
just becomes an x.

00:03:06.565 --> 00:03:13.660
X is equal to 30/40, where
it equals 3/4 of a foot.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.730
So this right here is going
to be 3/4 of a foot.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.440
Now what is 3/4 of a foot?

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.650
Let's see, 3/4 of a foot.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:31.710
We know that there are
12 inches per foot.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.280
The feet cancel out.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.120
12 times 3/4 is what?

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.050
You can divide the 12
by 4 and get a 3.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.770
Divide the 4 by 4
and you get a 1.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.040
You get 3 times 3.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.040
This is 9 inches.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.790
9 inches.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.800
So the height of the sand
right there is 9 inches.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.430
Now she wants the height of the
sand box to be 4 inches

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.570
above the height of the sand.

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:56.500
So this is 9 inches.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.320
She wants 4 more inches.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:04.220
So what she wants the height of
the sand box-- it should be

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.250
the 9 inches of the height of
the sand plus 4, which is

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.740
equal to 13 inches.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.370
And we are done.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.490
Let's do the next problem.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:22.130
It was a sale day in Macy's,
and everything was 20% less

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.760
than the regular price.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.550
Peter bought a pair of shoes.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.145
And using a coupon, he got an
additional 10%-- let me do

00:04:29.145 --> 00:04:29.960
that in a different color.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.960
He got an additional 10% off
the discounted price.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.700
The price he paid was $36.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.170
The price he paid for the
shoes-- let me do that in a

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:45.510
different color-- the price he
paid for the shoes was $36.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.920
How much did it originally
cost?

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:56.300
So let's just use-- so x is
equal to original cost. There

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.200
was just a regular
sale on that day.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.280
Everything was 20% less than
the regular price.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.190
So using that information, on
that day, if you wanted to buy

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:12.280
the shoes, the cost of the shoes
would be x minus 0.20x,

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.730
which is equal to 0.8x, right?

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.490
If you have 20% off of a price,
you're going to be

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.120
paying 80% of the
original price.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.410
So this is the price that
everyone would have paid

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:25.640
without a coupon.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.270
And that's what that line is
telling us right there.

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.180
Now Peter got a pair of shoes,
and using a coupon, got an

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.090
additional 10% off of this.

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.820
An additional 10% off of that.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.670
So he's paying 10%
less than this.

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.650
Or another way to think of it
is, he only had to pay 90% of

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.640
this price.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:54.510
If you take 0.8x and from that
you subtract 10% of this-- so

00:05:54.510 --> 00:06:03.760
from that, you subtract 10% of
that-- of 0.8x, this is the

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:04.740
same thing.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.870
All right.

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.290
This is a 1 time 0.8x.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.960
This is the same thing
as 1 minus 0.1.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.000
So this is the same thing.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:22.230
This is equal to 90% of 0.8x.

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:23.830
And it might actually be
very natural for you to

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.290
go straight to this.

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:26.790
It's natural for me.

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:29.930
If I'm paying 20% less than the
regular price, that means

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.660
I'm going to pay 80% of
the regular price.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.740
And if I get an additional 10%
off of that, that means I'm

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.720
only going to pay 90% of that.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.620
So this is what he's
going to pay.

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.400
And they tell us that
price is $36.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:50.650
That price is equal to $36.

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.170
So if we want to figure
out x, well, we could

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.600
multiply 0.9 times 0.8.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.820
Let's do that.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:01.240
So 0.9 times 0.8.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.740
9 times 8 is 72.

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.470
We have two numbers behind
the decimal.

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:06.550
One, two.

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.350
So it's 0.72.

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:15.490
So you get 0.72x
is equal to 36.

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:24.040
Or maybe we could say 72/100
x is equal to 36.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.620
Or we could even say this is
same thing as-- what is it?

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.290
That's the same thing
as 36/50, right?

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:34.330
36/50 x is equal to 36.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.410
And this isn't even in lowest
common forms. This is the same

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:39.900
thing as 18/25.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.940
But I like this number because
I have a 36 here.

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:45.800
And so I can multiply both sides
by the inverse of this.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.955
50/36 times this.

00:07:48.955 --> 00:07:52.830
I have to do to both sides
of the equation.

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:53.900
36's cancel out.

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.480
50's cancel out.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.010
36's cancel out.

00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:00.710
And you're left with
x is equal to $50.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:04.960
The shoes originally cost $50.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.000
Next question.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.160
Rosa has saved all year, and
wishes to spend the money she

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.050
has on new clothes
and a vacation.

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:18.360
She will spend 30% more on the
vacation then on the clothes.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:28.770
So let's say, let's say that C
is amount spent on clothes.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:32.070
She's going to spend 30%
more on the vacation.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:40.830
So let's say V is equal to the
amount spent on vacation.

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:43.010
Well, they just told us that the
vacation-- she's going to

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:45.030
spend 30% more than
on the clothes.

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:48.660
So the vacation is going to be
equal to the amount she spends

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:53.090
on the clothes plus 30%
of the amount she

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:54.390
spends on the clothes.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:57.790
And this is the same
thing as 1.3.

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:00.900
1.3 times the amount she
spends on the clothes.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:04.000
That's how much she's going
to spend on the vacation.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.930
Now, if she saved $1,000 in
total, how much money, to the

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:10.230
nearest whole dollar, can she
spent on the vacation?

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:14.080
So between V and C, she
can only spend $1,000.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:22.640
So V, vacation, plus her clothes
can only be $1,000.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.900
So we know what the vacation
is in terms of the clothes.

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:25.910
We can do a little
substitution.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:29.240
The vacation is going to be
1.3 times the clothes.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.420
So we can substitute there.

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:33.020
So you have 1.3 times
the clothes.

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:35.660
That's the vacation expenditure,
plus the amount

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:39.570
she spends on the clothes
is equal to 1,000.

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:46.710
This is 1.3 plus 1 is 2.3, times
the amount she spends on

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:49.500
clothes will be equal
to $1,000.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:53.330
Divide both sides by 2.3.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.890
I'll get the calculator
out for this one.

00:09:55.890 --> 00:10:07.770
So we have 1,000 divided by
2.3 is equal to $434.78.

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:12.740
So C is equal to-- I already
forgot the number-- 434.78.

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:17.080
$434.78.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.320
So if that's the amount she
spends on clothes, the rest of

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.150
her money is going to be
spent on a vacation.

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:24.770
So her vacation is going
to be 1,000 minus this.

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:26.390
So her vacation expenditure
is going to

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:31.710
be 1,000 minus $434.78.

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:34.050
I'll do the calculator
for this one.

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:34.410
Let's see.

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:36.940
Let's make this into
a negative number.

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:42.190
And then, let's add
1,000 to it.

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:51.330
And we get $565.22.

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:53.990
And I'll leave it up
to you to check it.

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:56.090
This is how much she spends
on the vacation.

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:58.060
These add up to $1,000.

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:02.750
And this should be exactly 30%
more than this amount, the

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:05.560
amount she spends
on her clothes.
