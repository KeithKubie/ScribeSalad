1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:04,770
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:07,440
Just before Friday.

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,520

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,600
just checking in on you.
What's going on? How are you?

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,270
How's things in your world? It's almost
Friday. Ah, today's payday, right?

6
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:25,650
You're going to get that fucking check.

7
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:29,520
That fucking Douche is going to come
by with his gold towed socks, right?

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,100
Poke his head and your cubicle.

9
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,650
Wait that fucking envelope down, right?

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,850
And he's going to be talking to you
and you're not going to hear him. You,

11
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,380
that's going to be sitting there
smile. Or maybe it's a lady,

12
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,670
maybe it's a woman. Maybe she's coming
along with their sensible shoes.

13
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:51,110
You know, she doesn't have a heel
on it, right? She's taking it back.

14
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,540
You know, tell me what to do with my body.

15
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,570
How come guys don't have to
walk around in high heels?

16
00:00:56,571 --> 00:01:00,710
Why do women have to ruin their feet
and their fucking lower backs? You know,

17
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:06,740
that's like one of those fucking stories
that like with this stupid ass fucking

18
00:01:06,741 --> 00:01:10,550
election would actually become like a
national story, some dumb shit like that,

19
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,280
you know, complete fucking clickbait
horse shit. Who gives a fuck?

20
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,160
You know, I dunno.

21
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:24,190
I don't know how people sit down and
watch these conventions my entire life.

22
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:28,370
I've never been able to get through
one. They are so fucking cringeworthy.

23
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:33,140
It's so phony. It's so
fake. The fucking smiles,

24
00:01:33,141 --> 00:01:37,670
those maniacal. Hey like
just totally in your head.

25
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,360
You know the candidates at this point,

26
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,480
they have to be completely
fucking exhausted.

27
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:48,500
They don't want to answer any more
fucking questions and they still have like

28
00:01:48,501 --> 00:01:53,450
another 90 days or this shit that
they have to go through. You know,

29
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,930
you know like when a team
goes to the Super Bowl, right?

30
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,920
I mean you've got the two weeks right
before and they just fucking sit there.

31
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:05,120
All fucking they report is run out of
questions. Are they just sitting there?

32
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,910
That's two weeks of that shit.
And those players, they go nuts.

33
00:02:07,911 --> 00:02:11,690
Just doing that is fucker Kobo of a guy.

34
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,240
Fuck up my Yana Four. It's
only eight 30 at night.

35
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,690
This is fucking calm over dude
in the clam. They're, they,

36
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,100
they just keep answering
the same fucking questions.

37
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:23,210
It's gotta be easier for
Trump. You know what I mean?

38
00:02:23,211 --> 00:02:24,980
He just has to just make up some shit.

39
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:29,810
Listen into Trump,

40
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,040
give his speech is no different than
fucking listen to me do this podcast.

41
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:36,800
He might as well just be laying
there with his fucking underwear,

42
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,220
his fucking boxes, and just
talking to the American people,

43
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:44,540
just whatever the fuck he's thinking.
A just says it and then like fucking,

44
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:48,980
you know, whatever, 20 minutes later
somebody corrects him on Twitter.

45
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,830
That app is be all the time. Every time
I put out a podcast, somebody goes,

46
00:02:51,831 --> 00:02:55,400
hey man, not trying to be a dick,
but just let you know. You know?

47
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,190
Oh, the George Bush thing,

48
00:02:58,191 --> 00:03:00,880
I thought they would just make fun of
George Bush dance and I didn't know he was

49
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:04,300
doing it at the fucking, it's some,
you know, the police officers funerals,

50
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,460
the memorial service, you know,

51
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,940
I thought Lewis Hamilton was the
upstart driver. They're like, no,

52
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:12,370
it's actually Nico Rosberg and
every fucking week I do that,

53
00:03:12,371 --> 00:03:16,720
but I'm just some shit head. I'm
not actually running for office. Um,

54
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,270
oh, you're not bill. Thank
you for bringing that up.

55
00:03:19,271 --> 00:03:23,240
We didn't fucking realize
it. Um, so anyways, uh,

56
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,970
uh, you, you truly are a fucking patriot.
If you could sit through those things,

57
00:03:27,971 --> 00:03:32,500
especially this election. Cause uh, I
can't, I can't fucking do it. I can't.

58
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:36,650
Uh, oh my God. Rudy Giuliani, Yada.

59
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:40,930
I remember when he fucking
was going off Jesus Christ.

60
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,940
What the fuck was he? What
was going on with him?

61
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,920
I love always voice kept going up.

62
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,710
Like he thought the crowd was going to
go with them and they didn't really,

63
00:03:47,711 --> 00:03:48,730
they kept clapping,

64
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:53,020
but he kept increasing his energy
and his passion and nothing happened.

65
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,910
At least when Howard Dean
got going crazy when hey,

66
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,190
when he did that thing that
he was reacting to the energy,

67
00:04:00,191 --> 00:04:03,940
at least he was fucking
connected to those people. Rudy,

68
00:04:03,941 --> 00:04:06,300
I don't know what he was doing. Yeah.

69
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:10,780
I'll tell you the worst fucking image
you could ever picture is Rudy Giuliani,

70
00:04:10,781 --> 00:04:13,060
Bang and Hillary Clinton. I mean,

71
00:04:13,061 --> 00:04:17,110
just imagine that with his fucking that
look at his face when he was screaming

72
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:19,810
about the cops. And then
Hillary when she, you know,

73
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,710
fucking does that smile where
eyes get all wide. All right.

74
00:04:22,711 --> 00:04:25,840
I'm gonna ruin your fucking
day. Picture her bent over.

75
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:30,240
Put the fucking eyes all white and that
crazy smile and head behind like I got,

76
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,100
got just fucking banging
away. There you go.

77
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:37,450
That's on your fucking hard drive
now. You can never erase that.

78
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,620
Um, oh shit. Look at me.

79
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,800
That's another one for the MMP
fucking Photoshop right there.

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,640
I look for that one too.
Tomorrow on fucking,

81
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:53,710
I guess today you listen to it tomorrow
for me on the old fucking Twitter,

82
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:58,990
Twitter sphere. Um, I had such a
great time this week. You know,

83
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,190
not having to go in the fucking
writer's room has been awesome. Uh,

84
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,990
getting caught up in
all the shit you know,

85
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,870
around the house and all that type of
stuff. It's just, it's just a fucking,

86
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:12,490
it's only being a comedian
is the greatest fucking job.

87
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,030
It's the greatest fucking job
you could ever fucking have.

88
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,550
Just go on stage and act
like a fucking idiot.

89
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:23,910
And then afterwards hang out with a
bunch of co comics and then you go home.

90
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:29,500
Then you wait 24 hours.
[inaudible] we're good.

91
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,980
Apologize for the yarn. And
all of a sudden, um, you know,

92
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,860
I don't know if there's just
something about listening to you,

93
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:39,490
to my voice that just puts me to sleep.
That's how I got to sleep every night.

94
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:43,660
You know, that I just start
talking out loud. You know,

95
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:47,350
I'm saying it in the rain, just saying
20 minutes later I'm, I'm, I'm asleep.

96
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,800
Um, anyway, so Monday night,

97
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,550
as I mentioned last week I did a,

98
00:05:54,551 --> 00:05:57,920
I was going to be doing the
goddamn comedy jam and a,

99
00:05:57,921 --> 00:06:02,360
I busted out the old fucking
John Barnum get up and a,

100
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:06,620
for the first time ever I played my
Ludwig 71 green sparkle fucking kit,

101
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,980
add my, my drum teacher
swung by the house.

102
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:13,520
He tuned the fucking things up so
they sounded great and I'm like,

103
00:06:13,521 --> 00:06:14,900
I don't know how they're
gonna sound in the room.

104
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:19,460
The fucking two year anniversary of Josh
Anna Myers show the Goddamn comedy jam,

105
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:22,640
which is now become a fucking
pilot on comedy central.

106
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:25,860
The show is just blown up. So
happy for all those guys. Um,

107
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:29,780
they had it at the Roxy
down on sunset strip. Now

108
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,850
you got to understand, I am a Phi
came of age in the fucking eighties

109
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,560
a meaning I didn't get laid til the 90s.

110
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,253
Okay.

111
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,670
Um, anyway. Yeah, it will, I'll tell
you it was a rough one for me. Right.

112
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,770
But basically I'm the fucking,

113
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,570
just the bands that were
going on that were, you know,

114
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:59,100
the sunset strip was total the
fucking hair metal, you know,

115
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,840
the beginning of the metal with
fucking, uh, ready roads, you know,

116
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:05,580
when he joined Ozzie and
all, all those fucking guys.

117
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,600
And then it went into the hair metal
and then guns and roses pulled it out in

118
00:07:09,601 --> 00:07:13,530
the end and then fucking, uh, who
Kate warrant and all those guys,

119
00:07:13,531 --> 00:07:18,531
all of that shit happened on the
sunset strip out here in fucking la.

120
00:07:19,051 --> 00:07:23,100
And I used to always read about the
whiskey, the Roxy, the Rainbow Rum.

121
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,860
You know, back when I used
to read hit fucking per ray,

122
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,800
anybody used to read hit parade, a
magazine. I fucking loved that magazine.

123
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,970
You know, they used to put all the curse
words in there and everything. I would,

124
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,451
you know what?

125
00:07:37,451 --> 00:07:42,451
I would actually buy one of those
off of fucking Ebay just to read it,

126
00:07:42,701 --> 00:07:45,820
just to see. I'll read, read
about all of those fucking bands.

127
00:07:45,821 --> 00:07:49,300
I knew everybody's name. I knew
the names of every fucking drummer.

128
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:53,140
I used to watch all the videos that
used to watch the headbangers ball.

129
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,850
Randy Rockman. I used to watch the
top 10 countdown. That was hilarious.

130
00:07:57,851 --> 00:08:00,400
It was either like Janet
Jackson or some hair metal.

131
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,420
I used to think Janet Jackson was,
was was like fucking pussy music.

132
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:08,410
But these guys will wear lipstick and
had their hair all tee stuff up like some

133
00:08:08,411 --> 00:08:11,530
desperate soccer mom trying to
fall in the last dicker of a life.

134
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,680
I thought that that was
fucking Guy Music, you know?

135
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,653
Okay.

136
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,800
Brittany Fox, I've always brought that
up. The girls school, all that Shit,

137
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,413
you know?

138
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:22,660
Okay.

139
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,440
Poison. Every rose has its store
and all of that shit. Right.

140
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,840
I got into all, I was into all of that.

141
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,510
Then I started working
in a warehouse and uh,

142
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,820
I worked with these fucking burnouts
that were, they weren't burnouts, they,

143
00:08:34,821 --> 00:08:38,140
they smoked weed, but my world, that
meant you were fucking burnout back then,

144
00:08:38,141 --> 00:08:40,900
you know, cause back then that was
considered was bad. If you smoke weed,

145
00:08:40,901 --> 00:08:43,160
it was illegal. We didn't
realize that you owe,

146
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,310
you actually helped with the
fucking memory back then.

147
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:48,070
We thought that not your memory,
it helps with Alzheimer's,

148
00:08:48,071 --> 00:08:49,870
whatever the fuck they
claim and who knows.

149
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:51,280
Okay.

150
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,000
You know, the whole fucking
weed thing is, it's,

151
00:08:53,001 --> 00:08:55,090
it's like the global
warming battle. I just,

152
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:59,880
it's going to go back and forth and back
and forth and then eventually Bose bags

153
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,210
like myself will finally give and
be like, all right, all right,

154
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:05,940
you guys were right about
the weed kind of way. People,

155
00:09:05,941 --> 00:09:09,120
all the corporations finally
went like, Oh, you know what, Eh,

156
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:12,540
global warming is happening and
it is because of us, but you know,

157
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,280
it's too late to fix it now.

158
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:21,000
Um, so I started working
with these guys and they, uh,

159
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,240
played in a band and like I came
from more of a jock town. Right.

160
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:27,640
Everybody just fucking played sports
or you just, you know, I don't know,

161
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,840
stood in the corner on a fucking
wall during a party, you know,

162
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,950
it was basically it, those are your only
two options. The town I was in and uh,

163
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,920
these kids were from a couple towns over
and everybody over there and played,

164
00:09:37,921 --> 00:09:40,770
played instruments and these
guys came. I worked with them.

165
00:09:40,771 --> 00:09:42,870
They were playing guitar and they are
playing the shit that was on the radio.

166
00:09:42,871 --> 00:09:47,510
And I, I didn't, I, I didn't do all my
agents. He can fucking get that. Good.

167
00:09:47,511 --> 00:09:50,390
That's amazing. And that's right.
Then when I bought my first drum kit,

168
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,260
I brought a, I was 20 years old when
I started playing fucking drums.

169
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,780
I had done everything late in
life. I was always fucking,

170
00:09:56,781 --> 00:10:00,820
I had day late in a fucking
dollar short. Right. And um,

171
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:03,040
I had this,

172
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:07,960
I bought a five piece Slingerland
kit at the time it was,

173
00:10:07,961 --> 00:10:11,620
I bought it in 1988 I think.
And it was like 10 years old.

174
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:16,240
It was all bottom sizes, but it
was more like the five ply ones.

175
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,100
It wasn't the three
ply shelves. So it was,

176
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:22,480
they were already starting to fucking
make them too heavy. But uh, it was uh,

177
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:26,830
black and it had a, Oh God, I
can't remember the fucking sizes.

178
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:33,040
It was Whoa, it had an 18 inch
floor, Tom, a 24 inch kick.

179
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:38,380
And then what the fuck was the
rack? I think it was like a 13.

180
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:43,280
It was really weird sizes.
And then later I ended up,

181
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,760
I went down to l Drew's shop
in Woonsocket, Rhode Island.

182
00:10:46,761 --> 00:10:50,060
I believe that's where it was.
And I found a 16 inch floor Tom,

183
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,590
which was fucking unbelievable.
That matched my kit. Even
the badges said Niles,

184
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:57,740
Chicago, Niles, Illinois. Sorry. Um,

185
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,913
and

186
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,610
you know, there was no fucking
Ebay back then. I didn't know.

187
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,950
There was no way to track down all of
this shit that people had lying around the

188
00:11:06,951 --> 00:11:08,510
house. I just went into that place.

189
00:11:08,511 --> 00:11:11,330
They had all these old drums and they
happen to have that and I fucking bought

190
00:11:11,331 --> 00:11:15,930
that thing. I was nine
by 13, 10 by 14, 13,

191
00:11:15,931 --> 00:11:20,610
14 in 18 and a 24 kick. So
then I got the six 16 inch.

192
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:24,660
So now I had um, I had a six piece kit,

193
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:25,920
which I thought was the shit.

194
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:29,670
And then I got some Rodo toms put them
on the other side of the high hat cause I

195
00:11:29,671 --> 00:11:33,180
was watching Alex van Halen cause it
was all about having the biggest fucking

196
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:34,770
kits you could possibly have.

197
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,230
Okay.

198
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:39,800
And then along came guns and roses and a
guy named Steven Adler and he showed up

199
00:11:39,801 --> 00:11:43,700
with a little four piece
kit, right rack, Tom floor,

200
00:11:43,701 --> 00:11:48,150
Tom and his fucking ride sitting
in between the two, which was just,

201
00:11:48,151 --> 00:11:49,170
it was the shit.

202
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:52,440
And he got more music out of that than
half these fucking guys with double bass

203
00:11:52,441 --> 00:11:56,800
drum kicks. Fucking two toms above
each base drama to floor toms. Right.

204
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:02,320
And um, that just
completely changed my life.

205
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:05,600
So long story short, I used to always
read up on all that. I try to do all,

206
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,780
try to figure out how to spin
the sticks, all of that shit.

207
00:12:07,781 --> 00:12:12,010
And back in the day I could do was watch
MTV and try to figure this shit out or

208
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:13,450
you just listen to the records.

209
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,760
And we added even better
than the kids in the 70s,

210
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,430
cause there was no fucking
MTV. Maybe he caught him on a,

211
00:12:18,431 --> 00:12:21,820
I don't know Dick Clark fucking
show with some shit. So,

212
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,160
but I'll use to have it
here about was, you know,

213
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:29,140
if you wanted to fucking make it in
rock music back then you had to be down

214
00:12:29,141 --> 00:12:32,680
there. So here we are fucking
almost Jesus Christ. 30 years later

215
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:38,620
I finally get to fucking go down there
on a Monday night and I got to play drums

216
00:12:38,621 --> 00:12:43,330
at the Roxy. It was fucking incredible.
And I sucked when we practice,

217
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,180
like on Thursday, I sucked on Sunday and
then during soundcheck I was only okay.

218
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,010
And I was like, God damn it. I had
all these friends coming down ago.

219
00:12:51,011 --> 00:12:51,844
Wouldn't you fucking know?

220
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,610
Cause you know I hadn't played and
played since March and I'm a comedian,

221
00:12:54,611 --> 00:12:58,000
so I already sucked even
when I was playing. And, uh,

222
00:12:58,001 --> 00:13:02,440
so went out and did my set dressed as
fucking bottom and I sat down behind the

223
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,840
kit. I don't know what happened.
I just took it, I don't know,

224
00:13:04,841 --> 00:13:09,070
just kind of fuck it right.
And I ended up playing for me.

225
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:14,020
I played great. I had the most fun. I
was the loosest that I've ever been at a,

226
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,310
it was fucking hilarious of
playing the song. And uh,

227
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,170
Dave Cushner who, uh,

228
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:26,190
does the music for a f is for family
and also was in velvet revolver.

229
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:29,030
He was playing the song too
when he always, you know,

230
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,820
fucks around and shit makes me laugh.

231
00:13:30,821 --> 00:13:35,620
So I had this stupid fake mustache glued
to my upper lip and he was making me

232
00:13:35,621 --> 00:13:37,960
laugh and I knew I couldn't
smile. It was going to come off.

233
00:13:37,961 --> 00:13:42,430
So then half of it was fucking flap and
he started laughing and then the thing

234
00:13:42,431 --> 00:13:47,410
literally floated off my face and we
only halfway through the first song and

235
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:50,500
then I had this stupid bandanna
around the fucking John Bonam wig.

236
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,110
That thing came off. Then
the hair was in my face.

237
00:13:53,111 --> 00:13:57,070
I looked like the chick from the ring
and my sunglasses started fogging up.

238
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,960
So it's funny, I was playing,

239
00:14:00,961 --> 00:14:04,450
I was on a green sparkled kid dressed
as John Bonam and we were playing ac DC.

240
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,870
None of it made sense. So of
course it was, you know, working

241
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:12,910
because you know, you just fucking
around. So then we did highway to hell.

242
00:14:12,911 --> 00:14:16,060
And in the end that was the encore. We
did highway to hell. And then everybody,

243
00:14:16,061 --> 00:14:18,780
we bringing everybody out per crusher, um,

244
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,760
who fucking destroyed. He opened,

245
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:26,260
he did a red hot chili
peppers, give it away now.

246
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,810
And not only did he come
out just wearing the sock,

247
00:14:28,811 --> 00:14:32,410
he talked to everybody in
the band into doing that. Um,

248
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,310
I was not out there for that. And,
uh, then Margaret show went up,

249
00:14:36,311 --> 00:14:38,560
she fucking killed it. Uh,

250
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:44,680
Harlan Williams saying eyes without
a face. He fucking killed it. And,

251
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:44,860
uh,

252
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:49,860
then Ron white went up and sang
Leonard skittered give me three steps.

253
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:54,980
I hope somebody took video with this
shit. So I had to follow all of that.

254
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,860
And uh, fortunately was a great
crowd. And, uh, so anyway,

255
00:14:58,861 --> 00:15:00,980
so in the end they brought everybody
out to sing highway to hell.

256
00:15:00,981 --> 00:15:04,850
And they kept me on drums. By then
my hair is, that wig is in the face.

257
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,010
I can't see through
the fucking sunglasses.

258
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:11,660
And in the end they just wanted me to
keep doing like the symbol wash thing as

259
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:15,410
the introduced everybody, you know,
another round of applause for everybody.

260
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,390
And I forgot and I couldn't see.

261
00:15:17,391 --> 00:15:20,000
So I kind of stopped playing
and I kept hearing the guitars.

262
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:23,100
It was a cluster fuck, but
it was hilarious. And, uh,

263
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:26,210
I want to thank everybody
that came out and, um,

264
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:32,090
I have to tell you that's
the best sounding fucking
drum kit I've ever played in

265
00:15:32,091 --> 00:15:37,010
my life. 26 inch bass drum.
And the way my teacher,

266
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:41,300
uh, tuned it up and the way they miked
it up, it sounded fucking unbelievable.

267
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,230
And what I loved was everyone in the band
was saying how great the fucking kits

268
00:15:44,231 --> 00:15:48,470
sounded. And, uh, I dunno,

269
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,690
I have to figure out, I swear to God,

270
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:55,370
I have to figure out a place where I
can just set that fucking thing up.

271
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,700
That's the goal. That's what
sucks about having a fucking,

272
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:03,540
there's no place to play. When you
play drums, you have a fucking guitar,

273
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:06,620
you can turn down your ramp. There's
no way to do it. And you know,

274
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:09,840
as fun as those electronic kits are, I
don't have just talking drums on this,

275
00:16:09,841 --> 00:16:13,320
but who gives a shit? I barely
ever talk this much about drums.

276
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,590
They got these drums. Like if
you live in an apartment, right?

277
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:22,110
The way it go if you still want to
play is you buy a set of v drums.

278
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,710
All right? Those are the best electronic
drums as far as I'm concerned,

279
00:16:25,711 --> 00:16:29,730
that are out there. You buy that mid
level one, so it's not that much money.

280
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,860
There's always ones used on Ebay.

281
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:36,930
And then what I used to do was I
would put foam down on the floor,

282
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:41,070
then just build the little two by fours
and simply apply would just build a

283
00:16:41,071 --> 00:16:43,230
little drum riser. Okay.

284
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:47,580
Put carpet on that foam and then
another layer of carpet. Okay.

285
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,370
And then you put the drums on top of that.

286
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:54,000
And then what you do is you go
downstairs and you meet your neighbor.

287
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:57,870
You tell him, hey, I play
drums. I'll only play during,

288
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:01,010
this is what I used to do. I say, I'm,
I'm stand up. I work nights. All right,

289
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,770
I'll play during the day. Only Monday
through Friday if I'm going to play,

290
00:17:04,771 --> 00:17:07,050
I play during the day.
If for whatever reason,

291
00:17:07,051 --> 00:17:10,230
if you're ever home during those
times, here's my phone number,

292
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:13,950
just call this number and I will
immediately stop. I mean, that's,

293
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,110
that's the best you could fucking do.

294
00:17:16,111 --> 00:17:18,750
I told this story before and then
the guy ended up being a cunt,

295
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:20,763
you know,

296
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,660
one time out of the 5,000 times I played,

297
00:17:24,661 --> 00:17:29,661
he ended up being home sick or some shit
or he had a vacation and he called up,

298
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,580
alright, I pick up the phone. I'm
like, hello. And he just goes,

299
00:17:32,581 --> 00:17:36,850
can you knock it off like
right out of the fucking gate?

300
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:38,610
Okay.

301
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:40,860
And I was like, all right,
Jesus, quite, I was younger then.

302
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,350
Now it would've been like, dude, hey.
Yeah, you don't fucking say that.

303
00:17:43,351 --> 00:17:47,430
Like you said it to me 50 fucking
times. You can't, I gave you my number.

304
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,280
I couldn't be any nicer.
All right, I'm gonna stop,

305
00:17:50,281 --> 00:17:53,700
but go fuck yourself and please call
me again if I bug you and I would have

306
00:17:53,701 --> 00:17:56,880
laughed at him and I would have
left it at that. But anyways, um,

307
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,220
okay.

308
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,280
Three Ali is, you're not playing
drums if you're on an electronic kit.

309
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,800
I can't explain it. It's weird because
if you're playing an electric guitar,

310
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,820
you're really playing guitar,

311
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,440
but there's just something about those
electronic drums. I Dunno, I think,

312
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:12,200
I think most dramas would agree with
me. This is something that you play.

313
00:18:12,201 --> 00:18:15,740
You sit down on electronic
drums and you're like, I,

314
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:21,010
how have I not fucking toward the world
is one of the greatest drummers of all

315
00:18:21,051 --> 00:18:25,400
time. This sounds fun. I sound
incredible on this fucking thing.

316
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:29,990
And then what happens is then
you sit down, bind a real kit,

317
00:18:29,991 --> 00:18:32,210
and you actually have to
make the sound happen.

318
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:35,930
Rather than just fucking hitting somewhere
on the pad and getting a nice snare

319
00:18:35,931 --> 00:18:38,690
sound or fucking bass drum. Then all
of a sudden you get on a real kit,

320
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,830
you're like, oh, that's
right. That's right.

321
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:47,990
I'm not one of the greatest dramas
of all time. It's the exact opposite.

322
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,350
I'm one of the worst fucking
drummers that ever fucking lived.

323
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,750
This is an embarrassment.

324
00:18:53,751 --> 00:18:58,010
I should be on an electronic kit cause
at least those you can turn down. Um,

325
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,680
so anyways, um,

326
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:02,320
okay.

327
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,130
I can't stop thinking of how fucking
unbelievable those fucking drum sounded.

328
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:10,000
I'll do. They sounded so
fucking good in, in between.

329
00:19:10,001 --> 00:19:13,450
We played if you want blood and then
when they will bring in everybody out.

330
00:19:13,451 --> 00:19:17,950
Like I was just, I still had
to keep playing them. They
sounded so fucking good.

331
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,750
Play that beginning beats it in my time.

332
00:19:19,751 --> 00:19:24,260
A dying back bet to do
[inaudible] they just founded. Oh,

333
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,330
they sounded fucking amazing.
That's killing me. I swear to God.

334
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,430
I swear to God. Why the fuck did
I build a gym out of my well,

335
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:36,550
cause I didn't want to be a
fat fuck. That'd be hilarious.

336
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:39,010
If I built a drum room instead
and I put those things out there,

337
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:39,731
nobody could hear it.

338
00:19:39,731 --> 00:19:42,400
And then I didn't work out and
I got fat and I started looking.

339
00:19:42,401 --> 00:19:45,070
You ever see those awful pictures of
John Bonam when he had the fucking wife

340
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:49,060
Beater on Jesus Christ and he's
like 27 years old back then?

341
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:53,470
Like people just looked so
fucking old. I don't know what,

342
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,950
I don't know what was going
on back in the day. You know,

343
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,480
like they just showed that fucking
lunatic, that fucking lunatic.

344
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:07,670
John Hinckley who shot Ronald
Reagan Shut Brady in the head,

345
00:20:07,671 --> 00:20:12,530
totally altered that guy's life. Quality
of life. Forget me fucking people.

346
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,860
He shut. They just let that
guy out. And Oh, by the way,

347
00:20:15,861 --> 00:20:20,300
he was obsessed with Jodie foster cause
he kept watching her in taxi and I,

348
00:20:20,301 --> 00:20:23,810
yeah, I think she was like 13 years
old in that fuck it thing. Yeah,

349
00:20:23,811 --> 00:20:27,710
let's let that guy out that
that's a good thing to do.

350
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:33,410
Jesus fucking Christ, the guy's
been in there for 35 fucking years.

351
00:20:33,411 --> 00:20:34,310
What's he gonna do?

352
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:39,290
So you're going to go work or one
of those yogurt shops. I mean, what,

353
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:40,500
what exactly is

354
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,360
the guy has no fucking resume,

355
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,130
you know, Dick, imagine

356
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:51,940
that guy's fucking resume. What it
must be like. Just be like, alright,

357
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,840
he plug Mr Ankle. He,
let's see here. And uh,

358
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:01,660
see he was 25 when he got
arrested. 1980, 81. Let's see.

359
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:05,080
So let's just say, let's say he was a
go getter. He got his first job at 16,

360
00:21:05,081 --> 00:21:10,000
so he would've had nine years on his
resume. That takes us back to about,

361
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,570
uh, about 1972. Let's see, in 1972, a,

362
00:21:13,571 --> 00:21:17,800
you had a job stocking
shelves in a grocery store.

363
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:21,820
He did that for a couple of years. Uh,

364
00:21:21,821 --> 00:21:25,270
you got a job at a bowling alley.
It's gonna be all 70 shit, right?

365
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:32,700
It, uh, then you shot
the president, right?

366
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:36,840
And then there's a a,
was it a 35 year gap?

367
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:41,760
Okay. Shout the president. 1981.

368
00:21:41,761 --> 00:21:45,930
And now you, uh, you want
to work here at staples.

369
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:49,590
Tell you what, we're going
to put this in the bin.

370
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,800
I'm going to have a manager look at it.
I want to thank you for coming in and,

371
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,340
no, no, no, no. There's no
reason to contact us. We'll, uh,

372
00:21:56,341 --> 00:22:00,660
we'll get back to you as soon as
we can. I don't understand that.

373
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,310
This is what I think they should do.

374
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:09,340
They should fucking transfer Hinkley to
wherever the fuck John Charlie Manson

375
00:22:10,551 --> 00:22:12,110
is. All right.

376
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:16,850
Then you stick them in side by side
cells and then they just host the reality

377
00:22:16,851 --> 00:22:18,260
show. You don't,

378
00:22:18,261 --> 00:22:21,440
neither one of them has seen the
outside world for roughly the same time.

379
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:24,770
Whatever. Charlie Manson's got like
10, 12 years on it. But at that point,

380
00:22:24,771 --> 00:22:28,580
once you're up to 35 fucking years, you
know, Oh, I've been in for 47 years. It,

381
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,860
that doesn't fucking
make a difference. Right.

382
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:35,180
Even you just have just fucking
talk locally, locally. No,

383
00:22:35,181 --> 00:22:37,340
just have them talk about
just, you know, random shit.

384
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:43,190
You just show him a video. Give him a
little glimpse of the outside world. Hey,

385
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:46,940
uh, Charlie Manson, what'd you think
about lady Gaga has meat dress, you know,

386
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:49,910
but whatever the fuck's going on in
the world, I don't know. All right.

387
00:22:49,911 --> 00:22:50,780
That's a bad idea.

388
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:52,953
Hmm.

389
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:55,260
Oh, is it? Is that a good reality show?

390
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:01,520
We've taken some of the most infamous
criminals of the past 50 years,

391
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:07,760
stuck them all in a circle of cells and
your eyes won't believe what happens

392
00:23:09,031 --> 00:23:10,730
next. Um,

393
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:13,860
you know what's funny is I could probably
get to at least the second level of

394
00:23:13,861 --> 00:23:18,861
pitching that show strong interest before
the whole thing fell apart and they

395
00:23:18,901 --> 00:23:19,860
realized like, well, wait a minute.

396
00:23:19,861 --> 00:23:22,280
How the fuck are we going to get
transferred this guy to the other prison?

397
00:23:22,281 --> 00:23:25,690
I the overhead's too
high, you know? All right.

398
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:29,250
There's always a moment with every podcast
where it goes off the fucking rails.

399
00:23:29,251 --> 00:23:31,620
And I'm going to go out on a limb
and say, it's this moment right here.

400
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,050
This is the moment right
now where I wonder,

401
00:23:34,051 --> 00:23:37,470
what the fuck am I going
to talk about next? Um,

402
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,400
do that guy 60 fucking years old now.

403
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:47,700
He spent from 25 to years old in a
fucking nuthouse and they're gonna,

404
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,230
they're gonna let 'em out now.

405
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:59,230
Well, fucking job. Cree
is a 60 year old. Yeah,

406
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:02,620
you got any yard computer skills?
You sit in there. What are those?

407
00:24:02,621 --> 00:24:06,330
I mean those giant things
from the $6 million man now.

408
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:10,480
Now they're like [inaudible] they weigh
like fucking three pounds now. You know,

409
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,780
he probably thinks it's a plastic book.

410
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:23,350
Um, I don't know what they said. They're
gonna fucking try to monitor this guy.

411
00:24:23,351 --> 00:24:26,140
What the fuck is wrong with it?
I just, I don't understand it.

412
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:27,780
Okay.

413
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,310
I don't understand that.
Like it isn't a thing too.

414
00:24:30,311 --> 00:24:32,890
If you're going to fucking
give a guy 35 fucking years,

415
00:24:32,891 --> 00:24:36,010
just put him out of his
fucking misery. Right.

416
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:43,490
Wow. What would you rather do? Would
you rather spend 30 years in a 35 years?

417
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,520
25 to 60 no one had 60 you get out or
they can give you the old right there.

418
00:24:49,371 --> 00:24:51,740
Fred, you know, your choice.

419
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:59,330
I think I'd choose a fire in squad if I
had to go out fucking get electrocuted,

420
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:00,870
you know,

421
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:05,190
or have you put me down like some old
collie with a little fucking injection.

422
00:25:05,191 --> 00:25:07,320
I don't want that shit. Who
would want that? I don't

423
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:11,520
just fucking have me in front
of a firing squad. Right.

424
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,540
Hey did we not the face just fucking
center mass. Boom. Done over. All right.

425
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,640
Here we go. Did I mention,

426
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:22,950
I can't remember cause I started this
podcast a couple of times here that I

427
00:25:22,951 --> 00:25:26,430
mentioned. I got some new
dates coming up. Okay.

428
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,560
I've mentioned the European dates.

429
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:31,980
I've got some new dates coming up that
are going on sale this Friday and I'm

430
00:25:31,981 --> 00:25:34,890
very excited about this
because these are the shows.

431
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:39,480
These are the shows that I'm doing as I'm
getting ready to do my fifth hour long

432
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:43,890
standup special. Very proud of that.
My five year five special anniversary.

433
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:49,440
Okay, here we go. I've got to make
update coming up. Coming up. Hey,

434
00:25:49,441 --> 00:25:53,340
it's coming up. Um, this is in Huntington,
New York at the paramount theater.

435
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:57,300
Wednesday, September 7th is a
7:00 PM and a 10:00 PM show.

436
00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:01,440
This is the makeup show for
that show that I canceled, uh,

437
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,770
due to weather out on long
island, um, earlier this year,

438
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,860
back in January, I believe.
I'm finally making that one up.

439
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:15,300
And then on September 8th, I'm in, uh, at

440
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:21,300
the Charleston Galley Yard
Center in Charleston, South
Carolina. September 10th.

441
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:25,950
I'm in North Fork, Virginia
at Chrysler Hall. Uh,

442
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:29,340
September 11th, Sunday I'm
in Richmond, I'm in Richmond,

443
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:34,230
Virginia at the Altria theater. And then,

444
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:39,720
um, let's see, the next weekend I'm
swimming with great white sharks.

445
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:44,040
I'll tell you about that later.
Uh, oh Jesus. Getting over a fear.

446
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:49,950
Stupid Thursday, September
29th I'm in Madison,

447
00:26:49,951 --> 00:26:53,460
Wisconsin at the Orpheum
theater. October 1st.

448
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:56,260
Holy fucking shit. Okay.

449
00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:01,490
Does that say all my Honda Brasco it's
just gonna be my triumphant return to,

450
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,160
to know I have not been
in Nebraska since. Okay.

451
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,410
Since I was always doing
college kicks. I don't,

452
00:27:07,411 --> 00:27:11,350
I can't remember the last time I
was there. The Orpheum theater.

453
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,640
Okay. That's going down
on October 1st all right.

454
00:27:15,641 --> 00:27:17,260
This is when we're getting
down to crunch time.

455
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:22,210
We're getting closer to the special
Thursday, October 6th. I'm in Atlanta,

456
00:27:22,211 --> 00:27:27,190
Georgia at the Fox theater.
Friday I talk October 7th.

457
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,390
I'm in Gainesville, Florida. All right.

458
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,540
What the fuck would a goddamn Yankee
like me be doing down in Gainesville,

459
00:27:34,541 --> 00:27:39,010
Florida and Friday, October 7th. Well,
I'll tell you what, boy, I tell you what.

460
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,420
Okay.

461
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:44,920
That's because on October 8th the LSU
Tigers are playing the Florida gators down

462
00:27:44,921 --> 00:27:48,910
there on the swamp. I cannot
fucking wait to go to that game. Uh,

463
00:27:48,911 --> 00:27:50,690
I love both those programs. And A,

464
00:27:50,691 --> 00:27:53,590
I've always been a dream of mine as a
sports fan to always to go into that

465
00:27:53,591 --> 00:27:57,220
stadium before they tear it down and
gave him some new flashy new one that

466
00:27:57,221 --> 00:28:00,700
fucking looks like everybody else's.
I just want to see the layout,

467
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:04,930
like that whole section of that weird
wall where it just says the swamp.

468
00:28:04,931 --> 00:28:08,500
Like what the, there was that one that
was multipurpose stadiums that they,

469
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,860
they used to be able to spin it around
and to make it a baseball diamond.

470
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:14,650
And then after a while it just
broke and they said, fuck it.

471
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:18,460
It's a football field. I have no
idea. But I want to go see that.

472
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:22,060
A very unique looking stadium and
their fans are fucking awesome.

473
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:25,930
And a as it's SCC football.
And then from a Saturday,

474
00:28:25,931 --> 00:28:28,150
October 15th to Thursday,

475
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:33,220
October 20th I'm going to be in
Washington DC at the national theater.

476
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,380
Now what's great about that is, uh,

477
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:39,720
I'll be doing probably a couple shows at
night. Oh, it's, yeah. Theater. Oh No,

478
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:41,400
actually no. Maybe I'll
just be doing one tonight.

479
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:44,460
I don't know when I'm gonna be doing,
but, um, that's the crunch time.

480
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,830
I'm working every single Saturday, Sunday,
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,

481
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:53,370
doing a little residency I believe is
what they call before I get ready to do my

482
00:28:53,371 --> 00:28:58,170
special. And um, I never
write my shit down.

483
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,790
And this time is a few things that I think
I'm actually going to try writing out

484
00:29:02,791 --> 00:29:06,600
and then improving on it and just seeing
how it goes on this special just to try

485
00:29:06,601 --> 00:29:07,500
something different. You know,

486
00:29:07,501 --> 00:29:08,850
I'm always trying to do
something a little different.

487
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,530
Can't be giving you the same old bill
every fucking special. Right. So, uh,

488
00:29:13,531 --> 00:29:18,360
I'm very excited about that. Uh,
I'm ridiculously excited about the,

489
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,870
uh, European tour coming up,

490
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:25,530
not excited about the long flight and um,

491
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:30,600
you know, the lovely Nia will not be
going with me to those fucking shows.

492
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,520
I'm just doing it cause it's a thrash.

493
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:36,600
I mean it's all right for me cause I get
that they at the higher doing the show,

494
00:29:36,601 --> 00:29:40,020
but she's just going to be
getting fucking, hey, you
like this city. All right,

495
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,400
here's another one. You
know, every fucking day.

496
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:47,530
I think that would get a
little old. But uh, so any who,

497
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:50,950
um, I think that's it, right?
Is that my little half hour?

498
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:54,530
Did I do my little fucking pennants
for the week here? Huh? Oh,

499
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:58,810
I'm seven seconds underneath. Um,
thank you to everybody. Once again,

500
00:29:58,811 --> 00:30:01,650
they came out to the goddamn
comedy jam and thank you to Josh,

501
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,230
Anna Myers and all those guys for
letting me get to play at the Roxy dude

502
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:08,920
dressed as John Bond and plaintiff's
71 Ludwig wicked me fucking,

503
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:12,030
you know what I mean? That's,

504
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:16,060
that's some shit some day when I'm fucking
old and I'm staring at the wall still

505
00:30:16,061 --> 00:30:18,880
drinking. Of course I'm going
out like Peter O'Toole, right?

506
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,260
Still fucking drinking.

507
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,500
I'm just going to have the greatest
smile on my face just thinking about shit

508
00:30:23,501 --> 00:30:27,370
like that. Like I fucking did
that. That was so much fucking fun.

509
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:32,290
And, uh, it was just great. I will do
that show as long as they fucking do it.

510
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:37,150
And, uh, so that's it.
And, um, yeah, that's it.

511
00:30:37,151 --> 00:30:39,940
Now I'm off to Ireland.
Next time I talked to you.

512
00:30:39,941 --> 00:30:42,180
I don't know where I'm going to be. I
don't know where I'm going to leave,

513
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:44,740
Ilana. I think I'm
going to be over in, uh,

514
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:47,950
I think I'll have already done the three
dates in Ireland. Maybe, or maybe not.

515
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:49,540
I don't know.

516
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:54,540
All I know is I think I drive
from Bristol to Manchester,

517
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,640
England. And if I have time,

518
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:01,420
I have to pay my respects at John Bottom's
grave and I have to do it in a row.

519
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:05,650
I going to do it. No fucking
selfie. None of that bullshit.

520
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,210
Uh, you know, tried to do in a classy
fucking way. You know what I mean?

521
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:13,750
I always remember, cause I went to Elvis's
house one time and I just felt bad.

522
00:31:13,751 --> 00:31:16,330
I went there to actually laugh,
like, oh, get a bit out of this.

523
00:31:16,331 --> 00:31:19,360
And I went to his house,
Graceland, and I just felt bad.

524
00:31:19,361 --> 00:31:23,810
I just felt like I was intruding
on the guy's personal life and uh,

525
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:25,380
uh,

526
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:28,570
if they had like a gift shop across the
street with like Elvis cuckoo clocks,

527
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:29,020
like decades,

528
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:33,100
one of the most exploited fucking
entertainers of all fucking time.

529
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:36,070
I mean the guy's been dead for almost
40 years to still make money off his

530
00:31:36,071 --> 00:31:39,550
fucking image. Um, then the end,

531
00:31:39,551 --> 00:31:41,170
you walk by his grave and the back,

532
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:44,910
it's just like a bunch of people
just walking by and Yammer and,

533
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:49,450
and saying dumb shit and they're just to
sound a fucking flip flops and poverty

534
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,830
just walking by. It was
just bad. It's like, well,

535
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:57,880
what are we doing here? What are we
doing? Are there like an Elvis head?

536
00:31:57,881 --> 00:31:58,840
The three TVs,

537
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:02,500
cause at least the lock to watch all
the fucking games and the TVs are all

538
00:32:02,501 --> 00:32:04,000
fucking out of date.
But you know something,

539
00:32:04,001 --> 00:32:08,740
when I went in there into his house,
I really saw how fucking like, yeah,

540
00:32:08,741 --> 00:32:13,060
this must've been the only place that
this guy could go to escape how famous he

541
00:32:13,061 --> 00:32:13,440
was.

542
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,680
And it must've been really nice for him
to be here and just be able to chill and

543
00:32:17,681 --> 00:32:18,281
relax.

544
00:32:18,281 --> 00:32:21,970
And it's just really fucking ironic that
this place that was so peaceful for him

545
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:26,410
is that we're all traipsing through it
all trying to stretch our heads and look

546
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:29,530
up to the fucking the upstairs.

547
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:32,920
So maybe you can see the toilet that
he fucking collapsed from, you know,

548
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,670
it's really bad. All right. I
guess I'm going to end on that.

549
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,130
All right.

550
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:45,190
And I commend anybody who really
honestly sits there and watches these

551
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,860
Republican and Democratic national
conventions at this point.

552
00:32:48,861 --> 00:32:52,490
If you can actually sit through
there. I didn't watch it, but did, uh,

553
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:54,260
did the fucking guy there,

554
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,713
um,

555
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,390
Bernie Sanders, did he, did he

556
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:03,690
just completely flip flop and Endorse
Hillary? Is that what he did? I mean,

557
00:33:03,691 --> 00:33:04,980
just how can I just not think.

558
00:33:04,981 --> 00:33:09,480
I just don't understand is how you can
sit there watching somebody in a debate

559
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:13,170
trashing somebody and trashing them and
trash from trash them saying why they

560
00:33:13,171 --> 00:33:14,310
think they're going to be awful.

561
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:17,520
And then when the person they say
is going to be awful beats them,

562
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:20,190
they then just do a fucking
one 80. It'd be like,

563
00:33:20,191 --> 00:33:24,450
I think there's person that I said sucked
is going to make a great president and

564
00:33:24,451 --> 00:33:25,980
as my full endorsement.

565

00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:50,623
do

633
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:58,180
rather well. When my, my
eyes were watching news,

634
00:37:58,181 --> 00:38:00,830
they closed and I was still listening

635
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,700
for when my hand was holding
hers, she whispered words

636
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:13,780
bouncing around the
room. [inaudible] spoke

637
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:19,840
and I was bouncing around the room.

638
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:25,363
[inaudible]

639
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,510
Hey, what's going on? This is bill bar,

640
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:35,100
the Monday morning podcast and this
is the third attempt at trying to be

641
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,550
remotely amusing on this thing. Cause A,

642
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:42,570
I've been on vacation last week and
I'm too unhappy and I'm too relaxed.

643
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:47,500
I had a great time down
Nantucket, one of the, uh,

644
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:52,990
one of the widest places on the
planet. It's not that what's funny,

645
00:38:52,991 --> 00:38:55,690
I just literally had to pause when
I said one of the, what is things?

646
00:38:55,691 --> 00:39:00,190
Because someone of color was coming by
and for some reason I thought that it was

647
00:39:00,191 --> 00:39:03,460
going to be viewed as racist. Like
I was actually going like, yeah,

648
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,700
it was really white. It was
awesome. It was actually,

649
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:11,500
it was so white. I believe my level
of whiteness was actually offensive,

650
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:16,810
if you can believe it.
And uh, yeah, very, uh,

651
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:22,690
I can't explain the
welfare. It's, I don't know,

652
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:28,310
I was staying out in Sconsin, which is
even more snooty than on Nantucket. But,

653
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:32,650
uh, if you ever get out there
is a little a tip I'll give you,

654
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:37,780
take a trip of the, a
fucking brewery out there.

655
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:41,260
The hell's the name of it.
Uh, Cisco, Cisco Brewers,

656
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,730
they make their own beer, wine
and vodka out there and uh,

657
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:51,040
go on their website. If you're a big
vodka drinker, cisco.com I believe,

658
00:39:51,041 --> 00:39:53,850
but just look up Cisco Brewer's CIS,

659
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:58,720
c o I'm telling you, this shit
is smoother than greatness. It's,

660
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,830
it's unbelievable. I guess
the island sits on an aquifer.

661
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,900
The amount of times people
told me that in the last week,

662
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:11,620
it's just some point it
would come up. Uh, you know,

663
00:40:11,621 --> 00:40:15,700
this island sits on an aqua
for and like you, I was like,

664
00:40:15,701 --> 00:40:19,840
what the fuck is an aquifer? I was
on vacation so the fuck wasn't there.

665
00:40:19,841 --> 00:40:24,550
It was more like, oh, and what
might an aquifer be? Evidently, uh,

666
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,920
you know, I don't know what it is.

667
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,600
I was going to go on the Internet
and I was going to look it up,

668
00:40:28,601 --> 00:40:33,601
but as far as I could tell from the drunk
people in their boat shoes and their

669
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:35,350
tiger woods shorts,

670
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:41,160
they was saying that a Nantucket was
formed from a glacier and somehow,

671
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:42,280
uh,

672
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:47,280
I don't know what sits on fresh water
and the water trickles under all kinds of

673
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:51,430
bedrock and shipped from Massachusetts
and ship that just really killed the

674
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:55,450
cleanest of the water. It fucking
comes from Massachusetts and shit.

675
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,690
It's like really fucking clear. But yeah,

676
00:40:58,691 --> 00:41:03,520
it goes right underneath the ocean
and I guess it comes right up and a,

677
00:41:03,521 --> 00:41:05,470
that's how they make their
pod could taste so good.

678
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:10,510
I learned that the trick that all my
life when I had no idea that the cleaner

679
00:41:10,511 --> 00:41:14,800
the water, the smoother and more
pure euro your heart stuff is.

680
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:18,580
So maybe that's why all those hillbillies
and they can moonshine up in the

681
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:22,990
Appalachian trail. You know,
you, they talked to somebody,

682
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:24,530
not 10 people I know who,

683
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:29,850
who've walked the Appalachian trail
and somehow got Lyme disease and a,

684
00:41:31,031 --> 00:41:32,500
you know, I'm all up for an adventure.

685
00:41:32,501 --> 00:41:37,160
But when you get like a disease that
they did an episode about on little house

686
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:41,990
on the prairie, you know what I
mean? Basically some 1800 shit,

687
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,230
you know what I mean? You get a,
it's all looked the other way.

688
00:41:45,231 --> 00:41:47,720
I mean we've all uh, put the gun to
my head, you know what I'm saying?

689
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:51,590
That's a modern disease. But
you get like typhoid fever

690
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,540
or the plague. I'll say
what's fucked up man.

691
00:41:56,541 --> 00:42:01,400
I was reading this book on the population
and uh, I think I talked about this.

692
00:42:01,401 --> 00:42:01,730
I can't,

693
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:06,620
I can't remember last week I was doing
podcast from a bathroom in this cabin I

694
00:42:06,621 --> 00:42:07,340
was staying at,

695
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:10,190
cause it's the only place I could get
some sort of cell phone service, but uh,

696
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:13,100
to reading this book about population

697
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,110
and basically I think medicine
is what really fucked us over.

698
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:22,940
A lot of people think it's dumb people
fucking and creating more people.

699
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:26,660
That's really caused the
population problem, but it isn't.

700
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:31,810
It's smart people giving dumb people
penicillin that has caused the population

701
00:42:32,811 --> 00:42:36,650
explosion. And A, I can't
stress to you enough,

702
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:41,120
having traveled as much as I had truly.

703
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:46,150
How many people need to die
in an avalanche for us to
ever save the polar bears?

704
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:53,990
I know the fuck I'm talking about going
to Goddamn Sunburn on my brain here.

705
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,570
All right. Now if you're new to my page,
man, I got a big thing coming up here.

706
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:59,960
Uh, I was saying last week my special
was coming out on August 23rd,

707
00:42:59,961 --> 00:43:04,280
they just moved the day by my own one
hour stand up special coming out on comedy

708
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:08,750
central on August 31st all right.

709
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,820
And it's called, why do I do this?

710
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:14,000
And it's actually coming on
after one of Dane pokes specials,

711
00:43:14,001 --> 00:43:16,310
which is great because he
has like 9 million fans.

712
00:43:16,311 --> 00:43:21,230
So if a third of them hang around
it's going to be a great thing for me.

713
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:26,900
Um, yeah, August 31st and
this week my CD comes out,

714
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:30,470
we'll be in stores, uh, of the same name.

715
00:43:30,471 --> 00:43:33,470
It's basically a CD of the
specialists coming out on 31st.

716
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:37,970
Then in September the DVD will be coming
out. So look for all that and stores.

717
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:41,240
I'll have more information this week
and I'll be putting something up on my

718
00:43:41,241 --> 00:43:44,120
website as far as, uh, they
give you all that information.

719
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,660
But let's get down to the podcast
questions cause my flight's going to be

720
00:43:47,661 --> 00:43:51,260
leaving here soon. My flight
to Charlotte and then on to La.

721
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:55,060
I don't know why I got the connecting
flights. Seemed like a good idea.

722
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:59,150
Fucking stupid. All right.
Uh, Bill with all, uh,

723
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:02,900
the latest postings. What the fuck did
my laptop just do? What are you doing?

724
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:05,270
Hello? Hang on.

725
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:08,630
You know that when you try to click on
something and then it selects it and then

726
00:44:08,631 --> 00:44:12,620
just start to going 90 miles an
hour down the page. All right, bill,

727
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:18,370
with all this posting of late have a
spontaneous crowd members heckles and

728
00:44:18,831 --> 00:44:21,620
interruptions. It's
getting me wonder about,

729
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:24,800
wondering about a couple of things
I butchered reading that question.

730
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:29,480
They're basically saying in the last month
I put a couple of postings on youtube

731
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:33,690
and on my mind space page of people
yelling out random shit during my shows.

732
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:37,230
Uh, her question is, uh,
you've seen or his question,

733
00:44:37,231 --> 00:44:38,011
I don't know who sent this.

734
00:44:38,011 --> 00:44:41,310
You seem to be pretty nice
generally to these people,

735
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:44,430
even if they're being a dick,
but I'm sure that's always,

736
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:45,870
that's not always the case.

737
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:50,430
Have you ever offended someone to the
point of them trying to fight you or made

738
00:44:50,431 --> 00:44:54,240
someone cry or something
else really awkward? Um,

739
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:59,220
actually, you know what, the two people
heckling me, the lady going, thank you.

740
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:02,250
And the guy who was in the
crowd who was blind, neither.

741
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,020
Neither one of them will be in malicious,

742
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:07,230
which is why I wasn't being malicious
back to them. You know what I mean?

743
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:10,320
That's kind of how I work at.
If someone's being a dick to me,

744
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:15,950
I become a nuclear Dec to them
cause you have to out get them.

745
00:45:16,951 --> 00:45:18,310
You know what I'm saying?
It's weird. You gotta be,

746
00:45:18,311 --> 00:45:22,680
you gotta go 10 times meter than they're
ever going to go. You know what I mean?

747
00:45:22,681 --> 00:45:25,260
It's like that untouchables. They
bring a knife, you bring a gun,

748
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:28,530
you know they make funny you fucking pen.

749
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:31,800
You talk about their mother's
vagina cancer or something.

750
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:34,620
I know it's disgusting, right. But
you know, I don't make the rules.

751
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:38,370
That's how it works. All right? You
want to change the stand up world.

752
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:40,920
You go do the late show.
You go do the third show,

753
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:43,590
Saturday night in the
middle of fucking nowhere.

754
00:45:43,591 --> 00:45:48,591
And you tell me that vaginal cancer does
not seem like a viable means of self

755
00:45:49,711 --> 00:45:53,370
defense. I'm not wishing
that on anybody, but, uh,

756
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:57,840
I'm not above bringing it up and
wishing it on a crowd number.

757
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:02,250
I Dunno. And it's hypothetical mother.
All right. That was brutal. Um, anyways,

758
00:46:02,251 --> 00:46:05,160
have you ever offended someone to the
point of them trying to fight you? Uh,

759
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:09,190
yeah. I had one girl chased me
around the state one time and uh,

760
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,470
I didn't know what to do, you know,

761
00:46:10,471 --> 00:46:14,580
cause she was abroad and if I
hit her I'm going to go to jail,

762
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:16,320
which is a funny thing about
that. You know what I mean?

763
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,470
It's like they get up there and they've
got a glass and they want to smash it

764
00:46:19,471 --> 00:46:22,470
over your head. You know,
I'm not trying to be a dick,

765
00:46:22,471 --> 00:46:25,440
but at the end of the day that is,
you know, the average woman is,

766
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:29,670
weighs over a hundred pounds, you
know, upwards of 150 you know,

767
00:46:29,671 --> 00:46:33,870
the average broad out there, you
know, they got some a d titties,

768
00:46:33,871 --> 00:46:38,700
they might be pushing one 60, who knows,
right? You start swinging a glass.

769
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:41,700
You know, I never took a physics class,
but you can really fuck somebody up.

770
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:46,470
But for some reason because they
have a vagina cancer free of course.

771
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:50,940
Um, all of a sudden now I have
to stand there. There's really,

772
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:55,410
there's really no way to get out
of it without looking like a tool.

773
00:46:56,490 --> 00:47:01,170
Either stand there and you let some
girls smash you over the head and be,

774
00:47:01,171 --> 00:47:04,680
you run away and you look
like the biggest fag ever.

775
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:09,360
Or see you blast them in
the face and uh, you know,

776
00:47:09,361 --> 00:47:13,350
then you look like, you know, you look
like a wife beater rather than no.

777
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:16,980
There was another adult who
they, rational brain who was,

778
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:22,060
you had a glass which is considered a a
is that attempted murder if you smash it

779
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:26,610
, I know if you smash a bottle over,

780
00:47:26,611 --> 00:47:28,650
somebody said that's assault
with a deadly weapon.

781
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:32,800
I do know that as is if you bumped
into somebody with your car,

782
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:36,100
I learned that how the one, I'll
tell you that story here in a minute.

783
00:47:36,101 --> 00:47:38,770
Basically what happens is lady came up
on stage so I didn't know what the fuck

784
00:47:38,771 --> 00:47:43,270
to do. So I just picked up the mic. Stan
and I put it between her and myself,

785
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,260
sort of alligator armed.

786
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:48,340
It didn't have an extended way out
cause I would seem too hostile.

787
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:50,410
So I kind of had it, you know,

788
00:47:50,411 --> 00:47:52,630
I didn't want to have it up against me
because that would defeat the purpose.

789
00:47:52,631 --> 00:47:54,670
So I kind of had to halfway, you know,

790
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:58,930
so it was like I was extending an olive
branch in a way and I basically backed

791
00:47:58,931 --> 00:48:03,250
up in a circle and she was so
drunk. She kept following me until a

792
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,840
place. She, I think she got tired. It
was danger fields where it happened.

793
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:08,410
And uh,

794
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:11,230
of course there's no security there so
they probably just sitting there laughing

795
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:16,740
in their oceans 11 waste cloak
from waist length, red coats,

796
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:21,550
math, fucking, why am I even trying
to be funny here on to fun to relax.

797
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:22,540
I'll be funny next week.

798
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,720
I already forgot the story that I
told you I was going to tell you.

799
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,220
Jesus Christ. Let me go back
here a second. What the fuck was,

800
00:48:29,221 --> 00:48:31,660
I was talking about being on stage,

801
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:38,650
somebody chasing you. Oh, the
car thing. But that's right.

802
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:43,390
What time? I was in a car. Right. And
that was driving. Isn't that unbelievable?

803
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:47,460
Yeah. I know. I'm living an amazing
life driving down the street and uh,

804
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:50,560
I put on my left directional,
it's getting to the left lane.

805
00:48:50,561 --> 00:48:54,280
So there's this lady in the left lane,
but there's enough room for me to get in.

806
00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:59,170
But she does the conti thing.
She stomps on the gas. Right. So,

807
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:03,150
you know, trying not to let me in, you
know what I mean? Then drives, you know,

808
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:05,890
she basically cut me off. She doesn't
let me until I get behind her,

809
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:09,790
I'd be better. So she beats at me. So
I'm like, what the fuck? I'm right.

810
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:13,600
You cut me off. I be back at
her. And then she just snapped.

811
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:19,140
She just slammed on the horn and held
it all the way up to this red light,

812
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:23,920
which was like a football field
away. She just went like, eh.

813
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:27,250
So like a half a mile staring at me.

814
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:30,970
I could see her VDI staring
at me in the rear view mirror,

815
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:34,000
came all the way up to
the red light, my hand.

816
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:38,560
And the second she stopped,
I just beat real quick.

817
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:41,950
I went to sleep just to piss her off
just so I'd get it last, you know,

818
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:47,380
the next thing you know, I just see her
reverse lights come on and she fucking,

819
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:52,120
uh, she backed into the front of
my car really lightly and I'm like,

820
00:49:52,121 --> 00:49:53,440
what the fuck is this girl doing?

821
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,410
And then I see a reaching into the
glove box and I was like, oh my God,

822
00:49:56,411 --> 00:49:59,890
she's got a gun. And there was somebody
behind me so I couldn't get out.

823
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:02,650
And Uncle Eddie, I panicked.
I didn't know what to do.

824
00:50:02,651 --> 00:50:05,770
So she jumps out of the car and you know,

825
00:50:05,771 --> 00:50:08,710
I rolled down my window like a
crack because I'm so scared. Right.

826
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:12,410
You know this, this psycho lady.
I'm like, what's your problem? She,

827
00:50:12,411 --> 00:50:17,411
she ended up having a pad and a piece
of paper and she wrote down my license

828
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:21,430
plate number. Then she jumped
in the car and she drove away.

829
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,450
Unfortunately somebody saw it and they
said, hey, was that a friend of yours?

830
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:28,790
Cause that's how lightly she hit me.
I said, no, that was some psycho.

831
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:31,370
And the person gave me their
business card, which I kept.

832
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,770
So because I'm a fucking Moron, oh,
I just completely forgotten about it.

833
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:40,370
And next thing you know, I'm on the road
and all of a sudden I get a phone call.

834
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:41,421
Yes. Hello.

835
00:50:41,421 --> 00:50:45,680
This is a offices Shepard calling
from the Elsa Gunda police department

836
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:51,020
investigating a, a hit and run
possible assault with a deadly weapon.

837
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:55,250
Basically what she did was she backed
her car into my car and then said I

838
00:50:55,251 --> 00:50:59,870
rear-ended her. Um, but I had the business
card so I was able to get out of it.

839
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:04,580
And uh, you know, who knows, I don't
know what would have happened. You know,

840
00:51:04,581 --> 00:51:06,260
I could've gone to jail and uh,

841
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:12,170
someone that tried to rape me and then
I'd have to kill him and then I'd be like

842
00:51:12,171 --> 00:51:14,390
Tom Selleck and that
really bad movie, you know,

843
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:18,680
that's why I like Shawshank redemption.

844
00:51:18,681 --> 00:51:20,360
That's the only one
with the dude actually.

845
00:51:20,361 --> 00:51:24,320
They show what would happen if an
accountant goes to jail. You know,

846
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:28,430
he doesn't start with doing weights
and somehow take over the jail. Now,

847
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:32,090
you know what happens? He gets fucking
raped and he gets raped for years.

848
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:36,470
And that's why you always want
to have a fucking alibi, okay?

849
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:40,670
Especially if you have a bad marriage.
If you're going through a tough time,

850
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:44,960
whenever you go out, always make sure
you've got a friend with you, okay?

851
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:47,630
Because if you don't,

852
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:53,440
someday when someone does you the favor
of lacking that fucking chick that you

853
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:56,240
stick of ad they're going to blame
it on you. And then you know what?

854
00:51:56,241 --> 00:51:57,680
You're going to get raped repeatedly

855
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:02,900
unless you're good at math, you know,

856
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:06,320
and the warden's a piece of shit and your
shiny shoes or whatever the fuck that

857
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:09,950
plays out. I don't know. I don't
know. Look, all I know is this.

858
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:13,070
I got a special coming out August
31st called, why do I do this?

859
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:16,010
Please do me a favor. Tell
as many people as you know,

860
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:19,730
and even people you don't know, just
bug people. Just tell them to watch.

861
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:22,910
It's August 31st my cds
coming out this week,

862
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:26,600
August 31st comedy central, and then, uh,

863
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:30,650
my DVD comes out in September. I don't
know why it's happening like this,

864
00:52:30,651 --> 00:52:32,660
but that's the way it's happening. So, um,

865
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:36,020
please watch that and then come out
and see me cause I've already written a

866
00:52:36,021 --> 00:52:39,700
whole new hour cause cause I'm the
shit. They don't, that's what I,

867
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,870
not the shit. You know who's
getting killed. I'm fucking,

868
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:44,450
I'm on my way to be in the shit.
Trying to be the shit. All right.

869
00:52:44,451 --> 00:52:47,600
That's why we're not, that's the
real reason why wrote another hour.

870
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:50,640
Actually that's not the real reason.
The real reason why I wrote this,

871
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:54,570
cause I'm so fucking paranoid once my
materially has been out there that,

872
00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:57,230
you know, that's a big nightmare.

873
00:52:57,450 --> 00:53:00,380
My being on stage telling a joke
and having the whole proud going,

874
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:04,160
you already do do on TV. What the fuck?

875
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:07,040
And then I just started
bombing and then somehow

876
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:11,870
it spreads across the Internet. No
one ever goes to my shows again.

877
00:53:11,871 --> 00:53:14,260
I got to move back in with
my parents. Then again,

878
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:18,260
I'm working in a warehouse again on
loading trucks. You know what I mean?

879
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:22,370
Catastrophizing, I believe
is the thought process. Um,

880
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:27,030
okay, I'm going to wrap this thing up.
I'm going to be at the comedy works.

881
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:32,010
These are the gigs in August, and we'll
get the comedy works in, uh, Denver,

882
00:53:32,011 --> 00:53:35,640
Colorado, uh, starting this Thursday.

883
00:53:35,641 --> 00:53:39,810
I think that's July 31st through,
uh, Saturday night, August 2nd.

884
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:43,080
And uh, go to my website,

885
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:46,410
[inaudible] dot com to
get all the information.

886
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:50,670
I'll be at the Miami improv
somewhere around August 12th.

887
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,260
I don't have the fucking
dates in front of me there.

888
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:54,240
They're sitting right there in the
mind space page. You can say it.

889
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:57,570
And then after that, I believe I'm doing,

890
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:02,020
I'm doing the stress factory in
New Jersey, New Jersey. Sorry,

891
00:54:02,021 --> 00:54:05,840
I got the hiccups now. Um, I'm trying
to think if I can remember anymore.

892
00:54:06,370 --> 00:54:10,370
Podcast questions. Somebody asked me
a great question. I didn't drop it,

893
00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:14,130
but it was a copy and paste it
where I can read it right now.

894
00:54:14,131 --> 00:54:15,510
What the fuck was that?
It had something to do.

895
00:54:15,511 --> 00:54:20,010
What is the most overrated thing you ever
saw in your life and what do you think

896
00:54:20,011 --> 00:54:23,550
is the most underrated? And uh, that's,

897
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:26,730
that's too big a topic to
just come up with one answer.

898
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,220
I'm going to answer even
more of it next week.

899
00:54:29,221 --> 00:54:34,221
But the shit off the top of my head that
I could say was the most overrated shit

900
00:54:34,651 --> 00:54:37,950
of all time. Uh, let's see,

901
00:54:37,951 --> 00:54:40,350
Josh Hartnett the strokes.

902
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:46,050
Tony Manda rich, any old sports
fans out there? Remember that guy?

903
00:54:46,051 --> 00:54:49,570
The incredible bulk scat
was an offensive line.

904
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:51,600
They put them on the cover
of sports illustrated.

905
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:55,320
I Dunno what they thought he was going
to fucking do, but a, he didn't do it.

906
00:54:57,390 --> 00:55:01,590
Uh, what else was overrated? Fame.

907
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:05,910
Not, not being famous.
Just that TV show fame.

908
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:09,690
Everybody seems to love that show.
Bruce Springsteen. I don't get it.

909
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:12,420
I don't fucking get it.

910
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:17,520
You know the guy sells that giant
stadium 19 times in a row. So a,

911
00:55:17,521 --> 00:55:21,870
it's gotta be me, but I'll tell
ya, I don't, I don't get it.

912
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:26,340
I don't, I don't fucking get it.
So I guess that's not underrated.

913
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:29,100
That would be one. How about this? A
good, here's a good one for you guys.

914
00:55:29,101 --> 00:55:30,420
Why don't you guys answer me this one.

915
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:36,440
What's the most popular thing that
everybody was into that you didn't get?

916
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:41,280
Okay. Yeah, I'm not, I'm not trashing
Bruce Springsteen like he's fucking,

917
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:46,020
you know, in sync or a boy band. You
know what I mean? I'm talking about like,

918
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:49,200
like you know those fucking plastic.

919
00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:53,960
See through clogs that everybody
seems to be wearing now. Crops,

920
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,400
you know, I don't get it.

921
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:00,990
The only person who wears shoes like
that is stuck in Mario Battalion. Okay.

922
00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:03,240
And I'll let you can make
pasta through the well method.

923
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:06,390
You shouldn't be wearing
those pocket things. Okay?

924
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:12,120
I didn't care if you were
on hell's kitchen. Just the
worst fucking show on TV.

925
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:13,470
Just can't believe it. What else?

926
00:56:13,471 --> 00:56:15,510
People sit there and they
let that guy yell at him.

927
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:19,650
It's bad enough you've got to go.
Yes, chef. You know what I'm saying?

928
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:25,360
Like he won a war or something.
Fucking guy makes tuna tar tar.

929
00:56:25,361 --> 00:56:26,194
Get over yourself.

930
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:31,350
I W I haven't had a child who just
allowed themselves to be yelled at by a

931
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:36,250
fucking chef to that level. That guy
looks like an Inchcape. Bobby Kelly.

932
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:42,040
I know Bobby Kelly's losing weight. You
guys should go encourage him by the way.

933
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:44,410
Look Great. Last time I saw him. This,

934
00:56:44,411 --> 00:56:48,640
I'm looking at the after picture of Bobby
Kelly walking by that he will get to

935
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:51,430
because I have faith in them. Um,

936
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:56,230
what else the fuck was I
talking about? Oh yeah.

937
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:59,620
The shit that everybody's into
that, that I just, I just don't

938
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:02,950
let them get, you know,

939
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:05,890
I'll tell you something that's
really fucking underrated. Water

940
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:09,010
water's really underrated.

941
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:12,970
Water's one of the most
underrated things of all time.

942
00:57:13,490 --> 00:57:17,710
There is no reason for coke, soda,
these fucking sports strengths.

943
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:22,270
See electoral lights and all that
shit. They did. Districts the water.

944
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:24,910
I'll tell you what else is underrated.

945
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:30,270
If you eat a banana and apple and an
orange and then later on the day you just

946
00:57:31,361 --> 00:57:35,770
have a house salad, you will be as
regular as a fucking race horse.

947
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:41,410
How these stupid shows on commercials.
What does it take? Giving people pills,

948
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:45,490
at least fucking old people, you
know, bottles down working anymore.

949
00:57:45,491 --> 00:57:50,140
It's like if they would just eat
some fruit, you know what I mean?

950
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:55,320
Eat some fruit and then have a fucking
salad and I'm telling you moon river,

951
00:57:56,350 --> 00:57:58,480
any fletch fans out there? Um,

952
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:05,770
what else? What else was fucking
a, I'll tell you know what?

953
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:10,000
I'll tell you the one thing that ever
lived, lived up to the hype was the iPod.

954
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:14,740
The iPod is one of the few
things, you know what I'm saying?

955
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:17,890
They never lived up to the
heights. And speaking of hype,

956
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:22,810
I'm going to see Batman this
week. And uh, as far as I know,

957
00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:28,180
he's Leger lives up to the hype
plan. Uh, playing the joker.

958
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:30,393
I tell it was fucked up.

959
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:35,440
Somebody had the amount of people who
came up to me with theories as to why he,

960
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:39,160
oh, cause people thought he killed himself
rather than he sort of took the wrong

961
00:58:39,161 --> 00:58:41,770
stuff the wrong time. You know what
I mean? Rung them out. You know,

962
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:46,030
somebody told me, he goes, you know,
like, you know what? I know why.

963
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:49,940
I know why. I don't know why. I
know why he killed himself. He was,

964
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:51,640
he was losing his hair.

965
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:56,520
Can you fucking believe that is
one of the dumbest still, like,

966
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:58,450
like he couldn't affair
of, like, he couldn't,

967
00:58:58,930 --> 00:59:00,910
he couldn't afford a fucking hair plugs.

968
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:08,350
I'll get one of those. John Travolta
wigs. You don't want to saying,

969
00:59:08,770 --> 00:59:12,070
we'll just shave you fucking head. Take
a nod from me. You know what I mean?

970
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:17,770
Why would you kill yourself? Just
get it. You know, I just, I don't,

971
00:59:17,771 --> 00:59:20,830
I don't buy that the guy didn't kill
himself. He just, unfortunately,

972
00:59:21,950 --> 00:59:23,570
I don't know what
happened. I haven't like,

973
00:59:23,571 --> 00:59:26,870
I'm going to try to act like I'm
trapper John and d here, you know,

974
00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:31,190
which I'm not obviously haven't
even played a doctor on TV, have I?

975
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:36,270
No, I haven't. I like it. I like how
it only took me eight seconds to,

976
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:41,240
to run mentally through my
whole fucking acting career. Um,

977
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:44,510
so anyways, what time is it
here? Oh, Shit. All right,

978
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:49,030
my plane's going to be born here in
a few minutes. Um, once again, uh,

979
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:51,470
thanks to everybody who came
out to my shows in Pittsburgh,

980
00:59:51,770 --> 00:59:55,040
please everybody watch my
special on August 31st called,

981
00:59:55,041 --> 00:59:58,880
why do I do this on comedy central? Uh,

982
00:59:58,910 --> 01:00:02,870
my CD comes out this week, I
believe on August 4th or fifth.

983
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,460
Uh, try to find that in stores. And, um,

984
01:00:07,490 --> 01:00:10,970
you guys really seem to be liking these
random videos that I've been making. Uh,

985
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,670
I just been kinda taping every
set that I do and if, uh,

986
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:17,570
if I'm basically is what
I'm going to do is if I buy,

987
01:00:17,571 --> 01:00:22,430
just go off on a risk that's kind of
specific to that city or if I have a good

988
01:00:22,431 --> 01:00:23,700
back and forth with somebody.

989
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:28,340
It's a great way to give you guys some
new laughs without me having to burn any

990
01:00:28,341 --> 01:00:32,740
material. You know what I'm saying?
Yo. You know what I'm saying? Um,

991
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:35,150
all right. That's it. You
guys all have a good week.

992
01:00:35,151 --> 01:00:37,570
Thanks for listening
to my podcast and, uh,

993
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:41,600
I'm working on a new website and I will
be putting all of my blogs up there.

994
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:45,350
Okay. That's why I haven't blogged
in a while. I haven't been blogging,

995
01:00:45,351 --> 01:00:49,550
but I have not posted
any of them because, uh,

996
01:00:49,670 --> 01:00:52,280
evidently the Facebooks,

997
01:00:52,281 --> 01:00:57,140
the myspace and the friend stirs
they own anything you post up there,

998
01:00:57,141 --> 01:01:00,320
they own, like, I can still
make a book of my blogs,

999
01:01:00,350 --> 01:01:04,910
which is what I'd like to do.
But so can they, and a, you know,

1000
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:07,880
I don't like working for free.
I don't know about you guys,

1001
01:01:07,881 --> 01:01:10,910
but I don't like doing that. So you know,

1002
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:14,930
I'm just going to start the whale blog
on my space from here on out is I will

1003
01:01:14,931 --> 01:01:17,480
just put something, you know, hey,

1004
01:01:17,481 --> 01:01:20,000
I wrote a blog and then I'll
just put a link to my website.

1005
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,570
That's how I'm going to do with,
because uh, yeah, you know,

1006
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:27,590
I'm saying I'm blogging, blogging from
me. I'm blogging and make you guys laugh.

1007
01:01:27,591 --> 01:01:31,910
I'm not blogging to get the fucking
Rupert Murdoch's and more free content.

1008
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:37,240
All right. And that is it. You
guys all have a good week and uh,

1009
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:41,180
I will talk to you later. Please go
out and buy my CD and stores this week.

1010
01:01:42,050 --> 01:01:45,500
I believe it's August 4th. I really
wish I had a date. I don't fucking know.

1011
01:01:45,501 --> 01:01:49,220
August 4th to August 5th. Just look
forward. Why do I do this in stores?

1012
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:54,140
Tell me what you think and I keep those
podcast questions coming and let me

1013
01:01:54,141 --> 01:01:57,710
know. Let me know some of the shit that
you think is overrated or you think is

1014
01:01:57,711 --> 01:02:00,400
underrated. And the
one thing that I dunno,

1015
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:02,900
people are just totally
fucking into when you're not,

1016
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:06,590
which might be the same thing as saying
something's overrated. I don't know.

1017
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:08,210
There you go. Why don't you

1018
01:02:08,210 --> 01:02:11,060
send me the definition of overrated
too. All right. Have a good week.

1019
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:15,570
But I was sure this
siren sang this song home

1020
01:02:17,230 --> 01:02:22,100
dance above the, as I sink, I
see them through a crystal. Hey,

1021
01:02:23,170 --> 01:02:27,960
if you're there, a sweet sound
bouncing around the never ending call

1022
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:34,750
the crystal bouncing room

1023
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:40,350
or now once

1024
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:13,943
around the room.

1025
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:37,573
[inaudible]

1026
01:05:01,070 --> 01:05:01,070
[inaudible].
