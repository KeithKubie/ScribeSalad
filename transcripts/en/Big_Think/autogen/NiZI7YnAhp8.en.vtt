00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500
eventually a descent into depression and
 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.150
eventually a descent into depression and
war so we have experienced a globalized

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160
war so we have experienced a globalized
 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.759
war so we have experienced a globalized
world economy before it had a lot of

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769
world economy before it had a lot of
 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.560
world economy before it had a lot of
successes but it also ended in a

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570
successes but it also ended in a
 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.110
successes but it also ended in a
spectacular catastrophe and I think we

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120
spectacular catastrophe and I think we
 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.240
spectacular catastrophe and I think we
have perhaps lessons to learn from both

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250
have perhaps lessons to learn from both
 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.400
have perhaps lessons to learn from both
the positive and the negative

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410
the positive and the negative
 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.509
the positive and the negative
