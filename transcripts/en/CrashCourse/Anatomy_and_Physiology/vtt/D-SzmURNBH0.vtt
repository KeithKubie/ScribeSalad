00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.180
Flo Hyman had always been a tall girl.

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.740
I mean... really tall.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.660
By her 12th birthday, she was already six feet,
and by 17 she’d topped out at just over 6’5’’.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.280
Initially self-conscious about her stature,
she learned to use it to her advantage when

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:14.659
she started playing volleyball.

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:18.760
She attended the University of Houston as
the school’s first female scholarship athlete,

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.300
and at the age of 21, she was competing in
World Championships. Nine years later she

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.820
made it to the 1984 Olympics and helped her
team win the silver medal.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.200
After the Olympics, Hyman moved to Japan where
she gained fame playing professional volleyball.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.820
But all of that ended in 1986 when out of
nowhere, she collapsed and died during a game.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.340
She was 31 years old.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.940
Hyman’s initial cause of death was thought
to be a heart attack, but an autopsy revealed

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.780
that she died from a tear in her aorta, caused by an
undiagnosed condition known as Marfan Syndrome.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.560
Marfan Syndrome is a genetic disorder of the
connective tissue. People suffering from it

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.470
have a defect in their connective tissue that
substantially weakens it over time.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.190
And you’ve got connective tissue pretty much
everywhere in your body, so it can cause big problems.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.270
Outwardly, those with Marfan’s tend to to
be especially tall and thin, like Flo Hyman,

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.280
with loose, flexible joints and noticeably
longer limbs and fingers.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.030
Those long fingers and bendy joints have actually
helped some athletes and musicians do things

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.380
that the rest of us can’t -- famous blues guitarist
Robert Johnson, piano virtuoso Sergei Rachmaninov,

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.600
and Italian violinist Niccolo Paganini are
all believed to have had Marfan Syndrome.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.540
But these abilities come at a great cost -- as people
with Marfan’s get older, their weakening

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.640
tissue can cause serious problems in the joints,
eyes, lungs, and heart.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.189
The fact that a single genetic mutation can
affect your bones, cartilage, tendons, blood

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:37.650
vessel walls, and more, shows that all of
those structures are closely related, no matter

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.100
how different they may seem.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.860
We’ve covered the basic properties of nervous,
muscle, and epithelial tissue, but we haven’t

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.100
gotten to the most abundant and diverse of
the four tissue types -- our connective tissue.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.260
This is the stuff that keeps you looking young,
makes up your skeleton, and delivers oxygen

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.230
and nutrients throughout your body. It’s what
holds you together, in more ways than one.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.900
And if something goes wrong with it, you’re
in for some havoc.

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.169
And that means we’re gonna
be talkin’ about Jello today.

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:04.649
Uh…we’ll get to that in a minute.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.880
The springiness here? That’s connective
tissue. So is the structure in here, and the

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.500
stuff inside here, and the tendons popping
out here

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.700
Connective tissue is pretty much everywhere
in your body, although how much of it shows

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.040
up where, varies from organ to organ. For
instance, your skin is mostly connective tissue,

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.580
while your brain has very little, since it’s
almost all nervous tissue.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.730
You’ve got four main classes of connective
tissue -- proper, or the kind you’d find

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.370
in your ligaments and supporting your skin,
along with cartilage, bone, and blood.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.150
Whaaaa?

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.980
Sounds a little weird, but your bones and
your blood are just types of connective tissue!

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.200
So, despite the name, your connective tissues do way
more than just connect your muscles to your bones.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.260
Your fat -- which is a type of proper connective
tissue -- provides insulation and fuel storage

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.349
-- whether you like it or not -- but it also
serves structural purposes, like holding your

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.760
kidneys in place, and keeping your eyeballs
from popping out of your skull.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.480
Your bones, tendons, and cartilage bind, support,
and protect your organs and give you a skeleton

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.129
so that you can move with a purpose, instead
of blobbing around like an amoeba.

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:18.389
And your blood transports your hormones, nutrients,
and other material all over your body. There’s

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:21.160
no other substance in you that can boast this
kind of diversity.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.280
But if they’re so different, how do we know
that anything is a connective tissue? Well,

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.780
all connective tissues have three factors in common
that set them apart from other tissue types.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.569
First, they share a common origin: They all
develop from mesenchyme, a loose and fluid

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.129
type of embryonic tissue. Unlike the cells
that go on to form, say, your epithelium,

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:44.429
which are fixed and neatly arranged in sheets,
mesenchymal cells can be situated any-which-way,

00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:46.209
and can move from place to place.

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:51.060
Connective tissues also have different degrees
of vascularity, or blood flow. Most cartilage

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.540
is avascular, for example, meaning it has
no blood vessels; while other types of connective

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.909
tissue, like the dense irregular tissue in
your skin, is brimming with blood vessels.

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:04.340
Finally -- and as strange as it may sound
-- all connective tissues are mostly composed

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.190
of nonliving material, called the extracellular
matrix. While other tissue types are mainly

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.030
made of living cells packed together, the
inert matrix between connective-tissue cells

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.299
is actually more important than what’s inside
the cells.

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.739
Basically, your connective tissue, when you
see it up close, looks and acts a lot like this.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.460
Yeah. The most abundant and diverse tissue
in your body, that makes all of your movements

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:31.580
and functions possible? Turns out it’s not
that different from the dessert that Aunt

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.580
Frances brings to every holiday party.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.780
The jello that gives this confection its structure
is like that extracellular matrix in your

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:43.919
connective tissue. The actual cells are just
intermittent little goodies floating around

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.080
inside the matrix -- like the little marshmallows.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.629
And although it may not look like it in this
particular edible model, the extracellular

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:55.689
matrix is mostly made of two components. The
main part is the ground substance -- a watery,

00:04:55.689 --> 00:05:00.509
rubbery, unstructured material that fills
in the spaces between cells, and -- like the

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:05.330
gelatin in this dessert -- protects the delicate,
delicious cells from their surroundings.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.379
The ground substance is flexible, because
it’s mostly made of big ol’ starch and

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:11.300
protein molecules mixed with water.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.360
The anchors of this framework are proteins
called proteoglycans. And from each one sprouts

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:22.499
lots and lots of long, starchy strands called
glycosaminoglycans, or GAGs, radiating out

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:24.270
from those proteins like brush bristles.

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.779
These molecules then clump together to form
big tangles that trap water, and if you’ve

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:33.659
ever made glue out of flour, you know that
starch, protein and water can make a strong

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:34.879
and gooey glue.

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:38.559
But running throughout the ground substance
is another important component: fibers, which

00:05:38.559 --> 00:05:43.779
provide support and structure to the otherwise
shapeless ground substance. And here, too,

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.660
are lots of different types.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.719
Collagen is by far the strongest and most
abundant type of fiber. Tough and flexible,

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:54.399
it’s essentially a strand of protein, and
stress tests show that it’s actually stronger

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:58.879
than a steel fiber of the same size. It’s
part of what makes your skin look young and

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:01.330
plump, which is why sometimes we inject it
into our faces.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.679
In addition, you’ve also got elastic fibers
-- which are longer and thinner, and form

00:06:05.679 --> 00:06:10.289
a branching framework within the matrix. They’re
made out of the protein elastin which allows

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:14.409
them to stretch and recoil like rubber bands;
they’re found in places like your skin,

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:16.029
lungs, and blood vessel walls.

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:21.559
Finally, there are reticular fibers -- short,
finer collagen fibers with an extra coating

00:06:21.559 --> 00:06:26.559
of glycoprotein. These fibers form delicate,
sponge-like networks that cradle and support

00:06:26.559 --> 00:06:28.379
your organs like fuzzy nets.

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:32.189
So, there’s ground substance and fibers
in all connective tissue, but let’s not

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:34.249
forget about the cells themselves.

00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:38.809
With a tissue as diverse as this, naturally
there are all kinds of connective tissue cells,

00:06:38.809 --> 00:06:43.849
each with its unique and vital task -- from
building bone to storing energy to keeping

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:45.809
you from bleeding to death every time you
get a paper cut.

00:06:45.809 --> 00:06:50.659
But each of these signature cell types manifests
itself in two different phases: immature and

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:55.619
mature. You can recognize the immature cells by
the suffix they all share in their names: -blast.

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:00.099
“Blast” sounds kinda destructive, but
literally it means “forming” -- these

00:07:00.099 --> 00:07:04.599
are the stem cells that are still in the process
of dividing to replicate themselves. But each

00:07:04.599 --> 00:07:10.299
kind of blast cell has a specialized function:
namely, to secrete the ground substances and

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.379
fiber that form its unique matrix.

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:16.969
So chondroblasts, for example, are the blast
cells of cartilage. When they build their

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:21.980
matrix around them, they’re making the spongy tissue
that forms your nose and ears and cushions your joints.

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:26.740
Likewise, osteoblasts are the blast cells
of bone tissue, and the matrix they lay down

00:07:26.749 --> 00:07:31.029
is the nexus of calcium carbonate that forms
your bone. Once they’re done forming their

00:07:31.029 --> 00:07:36.089
matrix, these blast cells transition into
a less active, mature phase. At that point,

00:07:36.089 --> 00:07:41.900
they trade in -blast for the suffix -cyte.
So an osteoblast in your bone becomes an osteocyte

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.340
-- ditto for chondroblasts becoming chondrocytes.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:48.619
These cyte cells maintain the health of the
matrix built by the blasts, but they can sometimes

00:07:48.619 --> 00:07:53.149
revert back to their blast state if they need
to repair or generate a new matrix.

00:07:53.149 --> 00:07:57.619
So, the matrices that these cells create are
pretty much what build you -- they assemble

00:07:57.619 --> 00:08:02.319
your bone and your cartilage and your tendons
and everything that holds the rest together.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.860
Not bad for a bunch of marshmallows floating
in jello.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:08.840
BUT! There is another class of connective
tissue cells that are responsible for an equally

00:08:08.849 --> 00:08:13.469
important role. And that is: protecting you,
from pretty much everything.

00:08:13.469 --> 00:08:16.420
These are cells that carry out many of your
body’s immune functions.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:21.440
I’m talking about macrophages, the big,
hungry guard cells that patrol your connective

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.600
tissues and eat bacteria, foreign materials,
and even your own dead cells.

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:29.360
And your white blood cells, or leukocytes
that scour your circulatory system fighting

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.819
off infection, they’re connective tissue
cells, too.

00:08:31.819 --> 00:08:36.459
You can see how pervasive and important connective
tissue is in your body. So a condition that

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:39.680
affects this tissue, like Marfan Syndrome,
can really wreak havoc.

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:42.680
One of the best ways of understanding your
body’s structures, after all, is studying

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:46.560
what happens when something goes wrong with
them. In the case of your connective tissue,

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:50.840
Marfan Syndrome affects those fibers we talked
about, that lend structure and support to

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.420
the extracellular matrix.

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:56.060
Most often, it targets the elastic fibers,
causing weakness in the matrix that’s the

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.860
root of many of the condition’s most serious
symptoms.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:02.540
About 90 percent of the people with the disease
experience problems with the heart and the

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:07.290
aorta -- the biggest and most important artery
in the body. When the elastic fibers around

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:11.800
the aorta weaken, they can’t provide the
artery with enough support. So, over time,

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.300
the aorta begins to enlarge -- so much so
that it can rupture.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:19.319
This is probably what happened to Flo Hyman.
She was physically exerting herself, and her

00:09:19.319 --> 00:09:23.919
artery -- without the support of its connective
tissue -- couldn’t take the stress, and it tore.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:28.759
There's SO MUCH going on with your connective
tissue -- so many variations within their

00:09:28.759 --> 00:09:33.490
weird diversity -- that we’re going to spend
one last lesson on them next week, exploring

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:37.340
the subtypes that come together to make you
possible.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:41.560
But you did learn a lot today! You learned
that there are four types of connective tissue

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:45.600
-- proper, cartilage, bone, and blood -- and
that they all develop from mesenchyme, have

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:50.520
different degrees of blood flow, and are mostly
made of extracellular matrix full of ground

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:55.779
substance and fibers. We touched on different
blasts, and cyte, and immune cell types, and

00:09:55.779 --> 00:09:58.959
discussed how Marfan Syndrome can affect connective
tissue.
