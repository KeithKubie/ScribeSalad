00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.380
Could we take a sample of your DNA and predict
what your face looks like?

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.380
Maaaayyyyybe?

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:06.380
Maybe.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.000
… Okay yes, but also not really.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.849
Craig Venter, a pioneer in human genetic research
and sequencing recently co-authored a paper

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.610
saying if someone got your DNA, they could
use it to reveal your face.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.280
In the paper, they sequenced the genomes of
over a thousand people, and captured a bunch

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.280
of metadata.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.090
They fed this into an algorithm.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.900
The program compared all the metadata to the
DNA, looking for small differences, and matching

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:30.900
features.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.130
This paper argues we should be concerned about
storing DNA on publically accessible databases

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.570
for the sake of privacy.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.910
They say, if compromised, someone could pick
out your face armed only with your DNA.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.020
Obviously, if true, this is pretty freaky.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.300
Especially when combined with another creepy
project from 2013.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.800
A New York artist took cigarette butts, hair,
and other discarded items, pulled DNA off

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.350
of them, sequenced that DNA, and performed
facial reconstruction.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.800
The idea being, this face could be the person
who dropped the DNA.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.420
The artist told CNN, she could reveal possible
“ancestors…, gender, eye color, hair color,

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.450
complexion, freckles, their tendency to be
overweight and a handful of dimensions of

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:11.450
the face.”

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.510
Put together, I’d understand if you’re
skeeved.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.610
This is a march toward GATTACA…Buuuut there
are still limitations.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.650
The artist says, these are “general likenesses,”
not portraits.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.490
And, Venter’s algorithm matched a diverse
group to their DNA 80-percent of the time,

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.650
but only half the time when they were all
one ethnicity.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.840
Critics of Venter’s paper say the numbers
aren’t good enough to justify any concern,

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.360
and one of the paper’s co-authors even said
it misrepresented their data.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.490
In the end, we only sequenced the human genome
in 2003, so there’s a lot to learn.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.229
Projects like these remind us of the sheer
amount of data we’re throwing away, every

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.450
day, about ourselves, in stray hairs, skin
cells caught in lip prints, and so many other

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:53.450
places.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.220
So, can we reconstruct your face?

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.220
No.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.040
But soon we may be able to match it with an
algorithm, based on a hair you left in a subway

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.040
station.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.630
Till then, more research and probably laws
are needed.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.619
After all that… you might be interested
