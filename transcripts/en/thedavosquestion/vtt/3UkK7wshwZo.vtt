00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:10.929
&gt;&gt; Our economic system in its current form
is simply not advanced enough to comprehend

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:17.269
the consequences of its own actions.
It is like a blind giant lumbering from continent

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:21.060
to continent, leaving incalculable ruin in
its wake.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.820
I propose that we give this giant a set of
eyes so that it might tread more gently, and

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.369
maybe someday even look upon itself.

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:36.140
&gt;&gt; The CEO of today will be judged not only
by how well we change our industries, but

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.130
also by how well we lead our companies to
make positive impacts on the world.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.730
&gt;&gt; When choosing a leader, we choose one with
[Inaudible] and worth.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.420
Because a good leader should show good example
to the others.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.040
&gt;&gt; The way in which we are growing things.
The way in which we are making products, providing

00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:01.420
services, is having an unexpected and disastrous
impact on the planet that we live on.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:08.220
&gt;&gt;We need to change and execute some new institutions
to set the right incentives, so that water

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.619
use becomes more efficient across the world.

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.560
&gt;&gt; Everybody who takes action actually has
an effect on at least somebody.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.540
And obviously the more powerful you are, the
more influential you are, the bigger the impact

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.039
there can be across the world.

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:29.409
&gt;&gt; It's not just in working together, its
new ideas, its creating new concepts and its

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.649
happening as we speak.
It will challenge the way we think, it will

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.109
challenge the way we work, and it will challenge
the way we work with others.

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:40.549
&gt;&gt; There needs to be a more equal division
between the company owner and the employees.

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:46.680
&gt;&gt;Please take full responsibilities for your
actions and your inactions.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.810
And leave a nice legacy for our children and
our grandchildren.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:02:00.780
&gt;&gt;Extend hands and overcome obstacles to make
open trades and exchange of ideas and exchange

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.020
of cultures and exchange of people easier
in 2008.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.600
It will certainly help make the planet a better
place [inaudible]
