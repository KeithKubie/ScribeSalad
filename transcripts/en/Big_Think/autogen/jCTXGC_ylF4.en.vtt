started out as as a nonprofit so it's
 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.130
started out as as a nonprofit so it's
called the seasteading Institute based

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.140

government I was looking at interesting
 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.750
government I was looking at interesting
opportunities for what we could do in

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760
opportunities for what we could do in
 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.349
opportunities for what we could do in
especially in terms of sea level rise

00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:54.359
especially in terms of sea level rise
 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:56.310

what the movement was was missing was
 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.090
what the movement was was missing was
the support strong support of a

government the that was willing to have
 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.360
government the that was willing to have
a light hand on on regulation and allow

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370
a light hand on on regulation and allow
 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.370
a light hand on on regulation and allow
such an ambitious project as as the

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380
such an ambitious project as as the
 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.200

first the world's first sustainable
self-sustaining floating island so

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.480
self-sustaining floating island so
 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.200
self-sustaining floating island so
French Polynesia had the advantage when

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210
French Polynesia had the advantage when
 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.030
French Polynesia had the advantage when
when I reached out to to see studying to

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040
when I reached out to to see studying to
 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.760
when I reached out to to see studying to
have several things that the Institute

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770
have several things that the Institute
 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:57.930
have several things that the Institute
was interested in and one of the first

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940
was interested in and one of the first
 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.190
was interested in and one of the first
questions they asked was about

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200
questions they asked was about
 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.300
questions they asked was about
connectivity so you know is your country

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310
connectivity so you know is your country
 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.510
connectivity so you know is your country
connected to the Internet backbone

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520
connected to the Internet backbone
 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.279
connected to the Internet backbone
connectivity is obviously crucial for a

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289
connectivity is obviously crucial for a
 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:09.690
connectivity is obviously crucial for a
big data that's going to be generated by

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700
big data that's going to be generated by
 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.479
big data that's going to be generated by
the researchers a scientist so the first

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489
the researchers a scientist so the first
 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:13.830
the researchers a scientist so the first
thing was do you have a submarine cable

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840
thing was do you have a submarine cable
 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.600
thing was do you have a submarine cable
and so we check that one off

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610
and so we check that one off
 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.420
and so we check that one off
2010 french polynesia connected to

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430
2010 french polynesia connected to
 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.770
2010 french polynesia connected to
Hawaii so we're right on the Internet

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780
Hawaii so we're right on the Internet
 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.680
Hawaii so we're right on the Internet
backbone huge unused capacity

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690
backbone huge unused capacity
 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.440
backbone huge unused capacity
I think 99% unused so obviously

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450
I think 99% unused so obviously
 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.000
I think 99% unused so obviously
available for for research and the

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010
available for for research and the
 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.210
available for for research and the
second major concern was about

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220
second major concern was about
 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.310
second major concern was about
hurricanes cyclones and tsunamis so

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320
hurricanes cyclones and tsunamis so
 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.560
hurricanes cyclones and tsunamis so
basically all right we're gonna be doing

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570
basically all right we're gonna be doing
 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.930
basically all right we're gonna be doing
this this pilot project floating island

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940
this this pilot project floating island
 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.449
this this pilot project floating island
obviously the weather and the situation

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459
obviously the weather and the situation
 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.220
obviously the weather and the situation
in your country is important to us so we

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230
in your country is important to us so we
 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.199
in your country is important to us so we
did some research I already know from

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209
did some research I already know from
 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.760
did some research I already know from
from being from French Polynesia that

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770
from being from French Polynesia that
 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.580
from being from French Polynesia that
this was a very rare occurrence I think

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590
this was a very rare occurrence I think
 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.949
this was a very rare occurrence I think
we've had two hurricanes you know the

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959
we've had two hurricanes you know the
 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.870
we've had two hurricanes you know the
last hundred years that had significant

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880
last hundred years that had significant
 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.930
last hundred years that had significant
damage there was property damage a very

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940
damage there was property damage a very
 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.520
damage there was property damage a very
light loss of life and tsunamis are not

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530
light loss of life and tsunamis are not
 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.720
light loss of life and tsunamis are not
really an issue for us we're in the

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730
really an issue for us we're in the
 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.670
really an issue for us we're in the
middle of the South Pacific so we get at

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680
middle of the South Pacific so we get at
 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.760
middle of the South Pacific so we get at
least an eight-hour window before any

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770
least an eight-hour window before any
 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.220
least an eight-hour window before any
tsunami were to hit us but just given

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230
tsunami were to hit us but just given
 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.570
tsunami were to hit us but just given
the geomorphology of the islands we

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580
the geomorphology of the islands we
 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.760
the geomorphology of the islands we
don't get these high waves that you get

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770
don't get these high waves that you get
 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.610
don't get these high waves that you get
when you have a continental shelf the

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620
when you have a continental shelf the
 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.470
when you have a continental shelf the
objective of the pilot is to get all of

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480
objective of the pilot is to get all of
 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.000
objective of the pilot is to get all of
these technologies tested on a smaller

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010
these technologies tested on a smaller
 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.449
these technologies tested on a smaller
scale it's small yet we should be able

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459
scale it's small yet we should be able
 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.100
scale it's small yet we should be able
to support around 200 people so our

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110
to support around 200 people so our
 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.440
to support around 200 people so our
objective is 200 to 250 people living

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450

that are linked to to the space we also
have the issue of energy now obviously

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269
have the issue of energy now obviously
 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.740
have the issue of energy now obviously
we we need internet on board the these

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750
we we need internet on board the these
 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.830
we we need internet on board the these
platforms we will have some low energy

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840
platforms we will have some low energy
 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.050
platforms we will have some low energy
lighting low energy pumps and we're

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060
lighting low energy pumps and we're
 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.729
lighting low energy pumps and we're
gonna be very careful with everything

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739
gonna be very careful with everything
 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.360
gonna be very careful with everything
that goes on board this these structures

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370
that goes on board this these structures
 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.830
that goes on board this these structures
but we feel fairly confident that there

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840
but we feel fairly confident that there
 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.110
but we feel fairly confident that there
are enough ways for us to to generate

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120
are enough ways for us to to generate
 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.270
are enough ways for us to to generate
energy so we're looking primarily at

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280
energy so we're looking primarily at
 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.390
energy so we're looking primarily at
floating solar panels there's a company

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400
floating solar panels there's a company
 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.070
floating solar panels there's a company
we're in discussions with in France it's

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080
we're in discussions with in France it's
 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.700
we're in discussions with in France it's
got some

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710
got some
 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.280
got some
in technology it's not just as simple as

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290
in technology it's not just as simple as
 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.070
in technology it's not just as simple as
putting solar panels on the water it's

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080
putting solar panels on the water it's
 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.620
putting solar panels on the water it's
you know it's the corrosion resistance

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630
you know it's the corrosion resistance
 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.050
you know it's the corrosion resistance
it's a wave you know how you mitigate

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060
it's a wave you know how you mitigate
 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.990
it's a wave you know how you mitigate
for wave action but here's the

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000
for wave action but here's the
 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.760
for wave action but here's the
interesting part about solar panels on

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770
interesting part about solar panels on
 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.500
interesting part about solar panels on
the water as opposed to solar panels on

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510
the water as opposed to solar panels on
 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.070
the water as opposed to solar panels on
land the water actually cools the solar

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080
land the water actually cools the solar
 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.780
land the water actually cools the solar
panels the back of the solar panels and

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790
panels the back of the solar panels and
 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.740
panels the back of the solar panels and
it increases the yield by about 20% so

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750
it increases the yield by about 20% so
 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.750
it increases the yield by about 20% so
we've got some advantages to that so

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760
we've got some advantages to that so
 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.010
we've got some advantages to that so
we're doing calculations as to exactly

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020
we're doing calculations as to exactly
 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.200
we're doing calculations as to exactly
what surface area we would need we're

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210
what surface area we would need we're
 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.700
what surface area we would need we're
going to be using some solar panels of

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710
going to be using some solar panels of
 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.180
going to be using some solar panels of
course on some of our roofs but in

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190
course on some of our roofs but in
 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.620
course on some of our roofs but in
addition to that we're looking at

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630
addition to that we're looking at
 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.680
addition to that we're looking at
there's some pretty modern wave wave

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690
there's some pretty modern wave wave
 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.850
there's some pretty modern wave wave
generation techniques so we're inside

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860
generation techniques so we're inside
 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.890
generation techniques so we're inside
the reef but there are waves right

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900
the reef but there are waves right
 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.410
the reef but there are waves right
outside of the reef so these are units

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.420
outside of the reef so these are units
 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.210
outside of the reef so these are units
that actually are underwater I think

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220
that actually are underwater I think
 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.100
that actually are underwater I think
about eight to ten twelve feet

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110
about eight to ten twelve feet
 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.340
about eight to ten twelve feet
underwater so they they won't disrupt

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350
underwater so they they won't disrupt
 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.190
underwater so they they won't disrupt
normal commercial you know boats going

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200
normal commercial you know boats going
 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.390
normal commercial you know boats going
out there leisure or commercial there's

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400
out there leisure or commercial there's
 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.550
out there leisure or commercial there's
not these are underwater they just

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560
not these are underwater they just
 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.160
not these are underwater they just
basically our buoys it's fairly complex

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:38.170
basically our buoys it's fairly complex
 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.630
basically our buoys it's fairly complex
a nail they just take in that wave

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:39.640
a nail they just take in that wave
 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.070
a nail they just take in that wave
energy is a little bit less but there's

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080
energy is a little bit less but there's
 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.570
energy is a little bit less but there's
still quite a bit of wave energy and

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580
still quite a bit of wave energy and
 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.930
still quite a bit of wave energy and
that will create addition to just a

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940
that will create addition to just a
 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.700
that will create addition to just a
solar so on our pilot project we we have

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710
solar so on our pilot project we we have
 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:51.990
solar so on our pilot project we we have
an idea of what we're doing for power

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000
an idea of what we're doing for power
 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.760
an idea of what we're doing for power
but ultimately the objective of these

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770
but ultimately the objective of these
 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.920
but ultimately the objective of these
platforms is to go to the open sea the

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930
platforms is to go to the open sea the
 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.510
platforms is to go to the open sea the
research has been done now I think it's

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520
research has been done now I think it's
 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.550
research has been done now I think it's
a matter of funding and of focusing all

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560
a matter of funding and of focusing all
 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.710
a matter of funding and of focusing all
of this on one major project and that's

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720
of this on one major project and that's
 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.350
of this on one major project and that's
our objective is first let's do this

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360
our objective is first let's do this
 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.670
our objective is first let's do this
this pilot let's prove that these

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680
this pilot let's prove that these
 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.530
this pilot let's prove that these
technologies work together let's prove

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:07.540
technologies work together let's prove
 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.830
technologies work together let's prove
that people can live in on these

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840
that people can live in on these
 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.590
that people can live in on these
platforms in a in a new social way and

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:13.600
platforms in a in a new social way and
 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.000
platforms in a in a new social way and
that's that's something that Polynesians

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.010
that's that's something that Polynesians
 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:17.010
that's that's something that Polynesians
are very interested in as well I mean we

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020
are very interested in as well I mean we
 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.710
are very interested in as well I mean we
were the original sea stutters in the

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720
were the original sea stutters in the
 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.140
were the original sea stutters in the
sense that we've you know colonized and

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.150
sense that we've you know colonized and
 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:23.670
sense that we've you know colonized and
migrated throughout the Pacific for a

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680
migrated throughout the Pacific for a
 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.430
migrated throughout the Pacific for a
thousand years and covered you know one

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:26.440
thousand years and covered you know one
 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.350
thousand years and covered you know one
of the largest oceans in the world so

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360
of the largest oceans in the world so
 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.880
of the largest oceans in the world so
living on the ocean is something that

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:29.890
living on the ocean is something that
 

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.740
living on the ocean is something that
Polynesians know about and I think we

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:31.750
Polynesians know about and I think we
 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.030
Polynesians know about and I think we
have a lot to contribute to the project

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:33.040
have a lot to contribute to the project
 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.410
have a lot to contribute to the project
as well

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:35.420
as well
 

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.670
as well
