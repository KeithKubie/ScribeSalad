00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.170
Most everything that a chemist
does involves mixing things

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.960
together in some way, so I
thought now would be a good

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.490
time to introduce some
terminology and some ideas

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:11.740
involved with mixtures.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.470
And in particular, I'll talk
about homogenized or

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.780
homogeneous mixtures.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.930
Homogenized implies that they
were made homogeneous, but

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.530
maybe they were homogeneous
to begin with.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:32.020
So homogeneous mixtures, and
you're probably asking what

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.540
does homogeneous mean?

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.510
It means uniform or consistent
throughout, that there's not a

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.870
lot of variation in the
mixture itself.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.620
And the most common word or
the example of this is

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.140
homogenized milk.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.630
I don't know if you've had the
privilege of directly milking

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.760
a cow or a goat, but you'll find
very quickly that if you

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.140
do, that the fat, the milk
fat and the non-milk fat,

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.400
separates very quickly.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.480
So if this is regular,
straight-from-the-udder milk,

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.990
you'll have a layer of fat that
shows up there, and all

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.720
of this stuff over here
is much more liquidy.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.610
What homogenized milk does is it
makes sure that all of this

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.980
fat is dispersed completely
evenly through the milk.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.590
So that's why, when you go to
your local grocery store and

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.450
you buy homogenized milk,
it's all nice and creamy

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.360
throughout.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.640
And you don't get this-- I guess
some people actually

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.190
like it, but you don't
get this nice sheen

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.740
of fat at the top.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.440
And it all goes down a
little bit smoother.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.850
So that's what homogenized
means.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.040
So a homogeneous mixture is
the same thing: even and

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.570
consistent throughout.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.080
Now, that is further divided,
depending on how large the

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.230
particles that are diluted
in the mixture are.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.840
So if we have a situation where
the particles are larger

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.160
than 500 nanometers-- and that
might sound large, but it

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.950
still isn't that big, because
a nanometer is one-billionth

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.580
of a meter.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.470
But if we have particles mixed
in, say, water-- but it

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.430
doesn't have to be mixed in
a fluid, or especially it

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.300
doesn't have to be water--
that are greater than 500

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.970
nanometers, we're dealing
with a suspension.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.930
And the one characteristic that
people associate with a

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.100
suspension is that whatever you
suspend in it, whatever

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.240
you mix in-- let's say I
have a suspension here.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.190
Maybe it's water, just because
it's easy for me to visualize.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.750
And I have some big particles
here-- that they'll stay in

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.850
the water for some amount of
time, but eventually they'll

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.270
deposit on the bottom
of the container.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.070
Or sometimes, they'll actually
float to the top.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.460
Depending on whether they're
heavier or depending on their

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.110
buoyancy, they'll either float
to the top or the bottom.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.200
In order to get it back into the
suspension state, you've

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.340
got to shake the bottle.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.970
So two examples I can
think of this.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.780
One is mixed paint, right?

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.610
Before you paint your walls,
you've got to make sure that

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.410
the can is well shaken.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.070
Otherwise, you're going to
get an inconsistent coat.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.180
The other, that's close to my
heart, is chocolate milk.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.470
Because when you mix it up,
it's nice and it seems

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.940
homogeneous, right?

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:26.380
It's nice.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.650
And I already have milk here.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.540
So right at first when you stir
it nice, you have all the

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.790
little chocolate clumps in
there, at least the chocolate

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.960
when I make it is like that.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.470
But then if you let it sit
around for a long time,

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.390
eventually all the chocolate
is going to collect at the

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:42.640
bottom of the glass.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.100
Actually, different
parts of it.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.860
I've seen situations where the
sugar all collects at the

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.880
bottom and then you have these
little clumps at the top.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.120
But you get the idea, that
the mixture separates.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.150
And that's because the particles
in either the paint

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.240
or the chocolate milk are
greater than 500 nanometers.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.500
Now, if we get to a range that's
a little bit smaller

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.740
than that, if we get to the
situation where we're at 2 to

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:10.520
500 nanometers, we're dealing
with a colloid.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.920
That word, I remember in seventh
grade, I think you

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.250
learned it in science
class: the colloid.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.770
And a friend and I, we thought
it was a more appropriate word

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.040
for some type of
gastrointestinal problem.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.970
But it's not a gastrointestinal
problem.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.060
It's a type of homogeneous
mixture.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.310
And it's a homogeneous mixture
where the particles are small

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.500
enough that they
stay suspended.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.860
So maybe they could call it
a better suspension or a

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:37.970
permanent suspension.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:43.260
So here the molecules are-- so
let's say that's my mixture.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.660
So water, maybe it's water.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:45.780
It doesn't have to be water.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.680
It could be air or whatever.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.240
Now the molecules
are small enough

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.700
that they stay suspended.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.640
So the forces, either their
buoyancy or the force--

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.630
actually, more important, the
forces between the particles

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.690
and the intermolecular forces
kind of outweigh these

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.920
particles' tendencies
to want to exit the

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.110
solution in either direction.

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.190
And so common examples of
these-- well, the one I always

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.410
think of, for me, the
colloid is Jell-O.

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.690
Jell-O is the brand name, but
gelatin is a colloid.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:25.410
The gelatin molecules stay
suspended in the-- the gelatin

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.720
powder stays suspended in the
water that you add to it, and

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.980
you can leave it in the fridge
forever and it just won't ever

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.800
deposit out of it.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.530
Other examples, fog.

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:44.650
Fog, you have water molecules
inside of an air mixture.

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:45.900
And then you have smoke.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.780
Fog and smoke, these are
examples of aerosols.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:58.280
This is an aerosol where you
have a liquid in the air.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.230
This is an aerosol where you
have a solid in the air.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:04.240
Smoke just comes from little
dark particles that are

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.220
floating around in the air,
and they'll never

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.800
come out of the air.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.880
They're small enough that
they'll always just float

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.150
around with the air.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:16.320
Now, if you get below 2
nanometers-- maybe I should

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.960
eliminate my homogenized milk.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.590
If you get below 2 nanometers--
I'm trying to

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.660
draw in black.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.460
If you're less than 2
nanometers, you're now in the

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.710
realm of the solution.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.660
And although this is very
interesting in the everyday

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.110
world, a lot of things that we--
and this is a fun thing

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.560
to think about in your house, or
when you encounter things,

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.510
is this a suspension?

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.740
Well, first, you should just
think is it homogeneous?

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.690
And then think is
it a suspension?

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.550
Is it eventually going to not
be in the state it's in and

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:51.450
then I'll have to shake it?

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.370
Is it a colloid where it will
stay in this kind of nice,

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.520
thick state in the case of
Jell-O or fog or smoke where

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.000
it will really just stay
in the state that

00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.660
it's already in?

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.130
Or is it a solution?

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:03.450
And solution is probably the
most important in chemistry.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:07.000
Although people talk about
colloids and suspensions, 99%

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.150
of everything we'll
talk about in

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.240
chemistry involves solutions.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.200
And in general, it's an aqueous
solution, when you

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.270
stick something in water.

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:14.840
So sometimes you'll see
something like this.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.530
You'll see some compound x in
a reaction and right next to

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:20.580
it they'll write this aq.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.830
They mean that x is dissolved
in water.

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:29.200
It's a solute with water
as the solvent.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.040
So actually, let me put that
terminology here, just because

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.700
I used it just now.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.120
So you have a solute.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.810
This is the thing that's usually
whatever you have a

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.415
smaller amount of, so
thing dissolved.

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:48.200
And then you have the solvent.

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.620
This is often water
or it's the thing

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:53.890
that's in larger quantity.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:57.620
Or you can think of it as the
thing that's all around or the

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:58.870
thing that's doing
the dissolving.

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:07.150
For example, you could
have sodium

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:09.460
chloride in aqueous solution.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.690
That means it's in water.

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:16.020
And what's happening is that
the sodium and the chloride

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.180
particles are dispersing.

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.550
So sodium is positive.

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:23.240
Chloride is negative, an ion,
because it took away the atom

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:23.930
from the sodium.

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:25.940
But when you put it in the
presence of water-- remember,

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:29.980
water, you know, you have all
the oxygen and the hydrogens.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.130
I've done this tons
of times already.

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:35.390
Oxygen and hydrogen.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:38.090
This is partially positive
over here on this end.

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:41.289
This is partially negative
over here, so you'll have

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:47.790
these larger-- the positive
sodium cation will separate

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:51.310
from the chloride and be
attracted to the oxygen ends

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:52.700
of the water.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:57.200
And then the chloride, the
negative anion, will be

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.990
attracted to the hydrogen
ends of the water.

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:01.690
That's what allows it
to get dissolved.

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:09.060
Because these ions have some
charge, they like to mix in

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:12.540
with the water, which has these
hydrogens, or has this

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:13.620
polarity to it.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.170
And see, the chlorine,
I'll draw here.

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:17.450
It will be over here with
a minus charge.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.710
So this is probably
the single most

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:22.670
important thing to realize.

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:25.680
And just so you get a sense of
what 2 nanometers is, this is

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:26.480
still pretty big.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.710
It allows for molecules that
have anywhere from-- actually,

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:34.120
a good number of atoms. If you
think of even a fairly large

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:38.270
atom, cesium, the cesium atom,
which is one of the largest--

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:40.040
at least one of the largest
that you might encounter,

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:46.490
there are larger-- is on the
order of 2.6 angstroms. An

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:51.540
angstrom is a tenth of a
nanometer, so that's 0.26

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:52.560
nanometers.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.880
So, for example, if you wanted
a molecule that would get you

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:59.220
out of the solution state and
into the colloid, and we're

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.325
talking in three dimensions
here.

00:10:00.325 --> 00:10:02.220
So in three dimensions you could
actually fit a lot of

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:07.860
cesium atoms within a
2-nanometer diameter sphere.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.890
Cesium doesn't bond in that way,
but I think you get the

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:13.080
idea that this is a scale of,
you know, on the order of 20

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.950
to 30 atoms can be
in this molecule.

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:16.950
Actually, even more than that,
especially if you have very

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:19.950
small atoms like hydrogen.

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:23.160
So the next question is how do
you measure these things?

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.690
And there's a lot of different
ways to measure concentration.

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:28.750
We already actually
used one of them,

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:30.000
which is mole fraction.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:47.300
And this is the number of moles
of solute divided by the

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:53.670
number of moles in the whole
solution, or moles of solute

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:58.650
plus moles of solvent.

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:00.500
And we did this when we figured
out the partial

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.190
pressure problems. Because in
order to figure out the

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:05.830
partial pressure of something,
you just figured out what the

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:07.760
total pressure is, and then
you said what is the mole

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.690
fraction of, say, oxygen
in the mixture?

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:13.280
And then you multiply that times
the partial pressure and

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:14.860
you got the mole fraction.

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:17.950
Now, the ones that show up a lot
in chemistry-- and since

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:21.350
their words are so similar can
get a little confusing-- are

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:28.320
molarity, not to be confused
with morality.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.780
One day I'll make a video on
that once I figure out enough

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:33.400
about it-- and molality.

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:40.090
And molarity, it sounds like
the right one because it's

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:43.180
almost like morality and it
has the word molar in it,

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:47.690
which is for me more intuitive
than the word molal.

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:51.080
But molarity in my mind is not
a good measure because it's

00:11:51.080 --> 00:12:02.130
moles of solute, so what you're
dissolving into it,

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:06.570
divided by liters of solution.

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:09.000
And the reason why I don't
like molarity much-- and

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.750
you'll see that molality is
actually, at least in my

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:12.810
opinion, more useful.

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:14.790
But the reason why I don't like
this is because liters of

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:16.600
solution is not invariant.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.700
It changes, right?

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:18.680
We've learned that a bunch.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.640
You know, pV equals nRT.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:24.830
The volume-- which liters is a
measure of-- volume can vary

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:26.410
with pressure and temperature.

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:28.650
So the molarity is going to
vary with pressure and

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:30.570
temperature for the
same solution.

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:33.145
If you just take the same
solution and take it to Denver

00:12:33.145 --> 00:12:36.660
or take it to Death Valley, the
molarity of the solution

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:37.330
is going to change.

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:41.300
So, to me, that isn't that
satisfying of a measure of

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:42.470
concentration.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:45.140
Molality, on the other hand,
is moles of solute.

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:52.290
So the numerator in both cases
is essentially the number of

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:56.270
solute particles we have-- the
number of particles we have

00:12:56.270 --> 00:13:02.770
divided by the mass of the
solvent, or the kilograms of

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:05.140
whatever we're being
dissolved into.

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.610
And the reason why this one is
better is because no matter

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:10.630
where you go, whether you're
in Denver or Death Valley,

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:12.010
moles aren't going to change.

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:13.340
They didn't change
here either.

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:14.870
And the mass won't change.

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:17.630
Now, the pressure and the volume
and the temperature

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.930
might change, but the mass won't
change unless you're

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:21.670
adding more or less solvent.

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:24.600
So this, in my mind, is kind
of the better one.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.680
And actually, I'll put a little
contest on this video,

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.060
if you all can think of good
ways to remember the

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:33.360
difference between molality
and molarity.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.650
Because, frankly, I think
this is one of the

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:36.290
most-- it's not confusing.

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:37.680
They're very simple
definitions.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.660
But I think a lot of people
get confused, especially a

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:42.340
year or two out of taking
chemistry class.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:43.610
If someone says, oh, what's
the difference between

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:44.810
molality and molarity?

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:47.680
You're like, oh, there was a
difference with volume and

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.260
mass, but I forget
which is which.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.400
And I'll leave it up to you guys
to think of a good way to

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.940
memorize the difference
between the two.

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:56.750
See you in the next video.
