00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:00.810
In this unit,

00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.430
you'll return to the two classes
that you covered last time as well.

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.465
You'll look again at Sebastian Thrun's
introduction to Machine Learning class,

00:00:06.465 --> 00:00:07.277
and Charles Isbell and

00:00:07.277 --> 00:00:10.340
Michael Littman's Machine
learning class from Georgia Tech.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.850
Along the way you'll cover
different methods for

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.460
doing Unsupervised Learning like
clustering and feature selection.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.230
We really want you to focus on
three things during this unit.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.070
One, we again want you to focus
on how Unsupervised Learning

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.140
fills in that model building gap from
the original Machine Learning work flow.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.140
Two, we want you to understand how to
compare different models developed using

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.870
Unsupervised Learning for their relative
strengths and relative disadvantages.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.760
But, three, and most importantly for
Unsupervised Learning, we want you to

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.240
understand the different kinds of
conclusions that Unsupervised Learning

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.160
can generate, the different kinds
of problems that it addresses and

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.680
how it differs from Supervised Learning.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.180
So you should come away from this unit
with an understanding not only of

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.120
how to do Unsupervised Learning, but

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.450
how it can address different
things from Supervised Learning.
