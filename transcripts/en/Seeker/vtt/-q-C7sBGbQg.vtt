This episode of Dnews is brought to you by

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.590
Want to know why your cat only loves you some
of the time?

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.069
Then come see me after this intro.

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.099
Look at this face.

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:15.639
Stare into it’s ferocious untamable eyes.

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.820
Cower in it’s innate ability to stealthily
stalk prey to satisfy it’s carnivorous desire

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.160
for blood.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.910
That little grumpy cat retains a wild side
my friends.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.640
By wild side, I mean wildcat side, as it is
still very closely related to the wildcat,

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.050
as researchers who have been tinkering around
in the genome of house cats have discovered

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.420
that they are still very closely related to
their wild brethren and as a result, are only

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.670
semi-domesticated.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.470
Researchers from Washington University in
St. Louis found that your little kitty still

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.600
retains numerous characteristics shared by
its wild kin, like hunting abilities, sensory

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.230
traits, and digestive similarities.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.040
The human-feline relationship began around
9,000 years ago as man’s agricultural efforts

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.040
thrived.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.340
As a result, researchers speculate that undomesticated
wild feline ancestors utilized the crops as

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.149
a hunting ground for rodents that fed on the
grains.

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:10.759
This created a very symbiotic bond with humans
who were like, these potentially dangerous

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.490
cats are great, I’ll reward them with other
scraps of food.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.560
And maybe try stroking one once in awhile...depending
on its stroke to claw my face ratio.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.990
This reward system encouraged the ferocious
felines to return for some easy eats, and

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.310
over time, the fear of humans diminished as
genes associated with reward response and

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.319
fear slowly altered over time.

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:34.840
These more domesticated cats would then breed
with similar domesticated cats, eventually

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.380
leading to the lazy thing thing in the corner
of your house bathing in that splash of light

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.090
pouring in through the window...but don’t
turn your back on that fat cat… it’s still

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.670
very wild at heart and will end you in your
sleep.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.159
Compared to dogs, which we’ve been domesticating
for an estimated 30,000 years, it turns out

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.079
the human impact on cats has been relatively
small and that explains why your cuddly little

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:59.419
furball is so solitary and frequently terrorizes
the mouse and bird populations of your cul-de-sac.

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:03.209
Interestingly enough, it seems the biggest
impact we humans have had on felines is in

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:07.789
fur and color pattern as we have aggressively
been breeding them for their looks for the

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:09.509
past 200 years.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.980
Make that one make it with that one cause
I want a fluffy calico.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.480
Whatever you want dear.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.010
Maybe you’re a feline fanatic who wants
to start your own cat website.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.439
Can’t have enough of those on the Internet,
am I right?

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:24.379
So why not buy your domain name from Domain
Dot Com.

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.360

Guys, let’s initiate an intense discussion.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.870
Dogs or cats.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:41.870
What’s better?

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:42.870
