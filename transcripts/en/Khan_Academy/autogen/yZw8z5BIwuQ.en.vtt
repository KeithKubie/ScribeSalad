00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.000
 "Click on the chart to build an isosceles trapezoid 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.360
 with peaks at (-2, 8) and (-4; -1). 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.660
 Another peak in (3; 8) 

00:00:09.663 --> 00:00:11.883
 and a base, nine units long, 

00:00:11.883 --> 00:00:14.633
 which is parallel to the x-axis. " 

00:00:14.633 --> 00:00:16.850
 Okay, let's see if we can do it. 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.052
 We can begin by applying these peaks. 

00:00:20.052 --> 00:00:21.259
 So, (-2; 8). 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:23.337
 x is minus two, y is eight. 

00:00:23.337 --> 00:00:25.357
 This is the point there. 

00:00:25.357 --> 00:00:29.355
 The next one is x is -4, y is -1. 

00:00:29.355 --> 00:00:31.252
 x is minus four, y is minus one 

00:00:31.252 --> 00:00:31.863
 and that's nice. 

00:00:31.863 --> 00:00:33.693
 They linked the points for us. 

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:36.564
 Then we are told (3; 8) 

00:00:36.564 --> 00:00:40.102
 Three, comma eight. 

00:00:40.102 --> 00:00:41.809
 It will be right up here. 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:43.202
 Now I think when I click on it, 

00:00:43.202 --> 00:00:45.106
 the program will try to draw rights 

00:00:45.106 --> 00:00:46.429
 between this point and this point, 

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:47.869
 which is not what we want. 

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:50.527
 This is a trapeze, an isosceles trapeze. 

00:00:50.527 --> 00:00:52.720
 Actually I want to connect (3; 8) 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.589
 with this point here, with (-2, 8). 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:56.587
 Let's see what happens. 

00:00:56.587 --> 00:00:58.746
 Yes, it's not what I wanted to be. 

00:00:58.746 --> 00:01:01.382
 Let me actually delete that. 

00:01:01.382 --> 00:01:02.101
 I'll wipe out here. 

00:01:02.101 --> 00:01:03.866
 In fact, I will first put this point first. 

00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.387
 Then I will bring this, 

00:01:05.387 --> 00:01:07.581
 then I will bring this and finally see 

00:01:07.581 --> 00:01:09.009
 where should I put this. 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:10.866
 So let me delete all these. 

00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:13.225
 We move all those in the trash. 

00:01:13.385 --> 00:01:16.439
 We move them all to the trash. 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.168
 Let me start from the beginning. 

00:01:18.168 --> 00:01:19.603
 I'll begin, 

00:01:19.603 --> 00:01:21.326
 this looks like some kind of bug in the program, but let's see. 

00:01:21.326 --> 00:01:22.963
 Let's hope it still works. 

00:01:22.963 --> 00:01:26.820
 Let's apply (3; 8). 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.220
 This is this point. 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.400
 Then we will apply (-2,8). 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.680
 This is the upper side of the inbred trapeze. 

00:01:36.685 --> 00:01:38.147
 It is good to have given us the length, 

00:01:38.147 --> 00:01:40.778
 the length of this upper side is five. 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.240
 And now we can put (-4; -1). 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.599
 This is the point here. 

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:49.564
 Okay, now it looks like a trapeze. 

00:01:49.564 --> 00:01:51.713
 And now we need a base, nine units long, 

00:01:51.713 --> 00:01:54.413
 parallel to the x axis. 

00:01:54.413 --> 00:01:56.561
 So the base is nine in length 

00:01:56.561 --> 00:01:57.706
 and is parallel to the x axis. 

00:01:57.706 --> 00:02:00.051
 We only have to move to the right with nine units. 

00:02:00.051 --> 00:02:03.172
 One two three four, 

00:02:03.172 --> 00:02:08.172
 five, six, seven, eight, nine units. 

00:02:08.173 --> 00:02:10.611
 And then we just move up. 

00:02:10.611 --> 00:02:13.409
 And it looks as if we got it 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:14.930
 isosceles trapezoid. 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.868
 What is an isosceles trapezoid? 

00:02:16.868 --> 00:02:18.656
 This means that these two countries, 

00:02:18.656 --> 00:02:20.757
 which are not upper or lower, 

00:02:20.757 --> 00:02:23.857
 or which are not the foundations, will be equal to one another. 

00:02:23.857 --> 00:02:27.177
 And we see that this country here is equal to this, 

00:02:27.177 --> 00:02:28.990
 and that this upper side is, 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.590
 you can look at it in the middle. 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:31.850
 This is one of the ways you can view it. 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.008
 I like this isosceles trapezoid. 

00:02:35.008 --> 00:02:36.250
 Let's check our answer. 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.235
 Let's make sure we have drawn it correctly. 

00:02:38.235 --> 00:02:40.171
 Yes, we did it well.
