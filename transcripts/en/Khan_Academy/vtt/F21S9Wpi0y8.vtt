00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.630
Welcome to the presentation
on basic trigonometry.

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.250
Sorry it's taken so long to get
a new video out, but I had

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.440
a lot of family in town.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.120
So let's get started
with trigonometry.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.590
Let me get the pen
tools all set up.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.830
I'm a little rusty.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.200
I'll use green.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.820
Trigonometry.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:27.790
I think it means-- I think it's
from Ancient Greek, and it

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.230
means triangle measure.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.290
I think that I read it on
Wikipedia a couple days ago,

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.610
so I believe that's the case.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.040
But all trigonometry is is
really the study of right

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.570
triangles and the relationship
between the sides and the

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.520
angles of a right triangle.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.890
That might sound a
little confusing, but

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.300
I'll get started.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.850
And actually, you've probably
seen a lot of these things that

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.940
we're going to go over now, and
you'll finally know what

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.840
those buttons on the
calculator actually do.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.730
So let's start with
a right triangle.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.016
Let's see, so it's a triangle.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.420
And it's a right triangle.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.470
Just for simplicity, let's say
that this side is 3, this side

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.730
is 4, and the hypotenuse is 5.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.540
So the trig functions tell you
that for any angle, it tells

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.170
you what the ratios of the
sides of the triangle are

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.130
relative to that angle.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.550
Let me give you an example.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.490
Let's call this angle theta.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.510
Theta is the Greek alphabet
people tend to use for the

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.000
angle that you're going to
find the trig function of.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.530
Let's say you wanted to
find the sine and s-i-n

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.020
is short for sine.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.310
Let's say you wanted to
find the sine of theta.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.500
So before we solve the sine
of theta, I'm just going to

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.310
throw out a mnemonic that I
remembered when I was learning

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.700
this in school, and I carried
it every time, and every time I

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.320
do a trig problem, I actually
write it down on the page, or I

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.940
at least repeat it to myself.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:09.500
And this is SOH CAH TOA.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.960
I have vague memories of my
math teacher in high school

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.990
telling a story about some
Indian princess, who was named

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.290
Sohcahtoa, but I forget.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.560
But all you have to
remember is SOHCAHTOA.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.680
Now you might say, well,
what it's SOHCAHTOA?

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.150
Well, SOHCAHTOA says that sine
is opposite over hypotenuse,

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.160
cosine is adjacent over
hypotenuse, and tangent is

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.110
opposite over adjacent.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.000
Now, that's going to be
confusing right now, but

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.420
we're going to do a lot
of examples, and I think

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.510
it's going to make sense.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.760
So let's go back
to this problem.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.280
We want to know what's
the sine of theta.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.380
Theta is this angle
in the triangle.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.300
So let's go to our
mnemonic SOHCAHTOA.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.700
So which one is sine?

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.930
Well, S for sine,
so we use SOH.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.040
And we know that sine from
this mnemonic, sine of, let's

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.150
say, theta, is equal to
opposite over hypotenuse.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.980
Opposite over hypotenuse.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.860
OK, so let's just figure
out what the opposite

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.590
and the hypotenuse are.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.790
Well, what is the opposite
side of this angle?

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.500
Well, if we just go opposite
the angle, let's go here,

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.890
the opposite side is 4,
is this length of 4.

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.100
I'll make that in a color.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.110
Oh, I thought I was
changing colors.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.150
Yeah, so this side is the
opposite, and I'll circle it.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.380
Now, which side is
the hypotenuse?

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.620
And you know this one.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.610
We've been doing this in the
Pythagorean theorem modules.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.320
The long side, or the side
opposite the right angle,

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.640
is the hypotenuse.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.160
So that is the hypotenuse.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.370
So now I think we're
ready to figure out what

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.750
the sine of theta is.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.390
The sine-- whoops,
I stayed in pink.

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.920
Sine of theta is equal to the
opposite side, 4, over the

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.670
hypotenuse, which is 5.

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.160
We're done.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.960
Let's figure out what-- let me
erase part of this, and we'll

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.652
figure out some more things
about this triangle.

00:04:08.652 --> 00:04:09.840
Let me erase this.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.210
I think if you practice this,
you'll realize that this is

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:18.660
probably one of the easier
things you learn in

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.090
mathematics, and it's actually
shocking that they take-- that

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.790
they wait until Precalculus to
teach this, because a smart

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.210
middle-schooler could, I think,
easily handle this.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.860
Not to make you feel bad if
you're not getting it, just to

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.130
give you confidence that you
will get it, and you'll realize

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.450
that it is very simple.

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:43.520
OK, so let's figure out
what the cosine-- and

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.010
cos is short for cosine.

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.530
I'll write it out, but I'm
sure you've seen it before.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.500
So what is the cosine of theta?

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.390
Well, we go back to our
mnemonic: SOHCAHTOA.

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.770
Well, cosine is the CAH, right?

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.570
And that tells us that
cosine of theta is equal to

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:06.680
adjacent over hypotenuse.

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.780
Well, once again, let's figure
out what the adjacent side is.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:20.000
Well, the adjacent side-- this
side was the opposite side,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.390
right, because it's
opposite the angle.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.480
This side is the hypotenuse,
because it's the longest side,

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.250
and then, you could, just by
deductive reasoning, but also

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.740
just by looking at it, you see
that this side right here, the

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.080
side of length 3, is adjacent
to the angle, right?

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.600
Adjacent means right beside it.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.950
So that's the adjacent side.

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.110
We already figured out that
the hypotenuse is that

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.400
side that I wrote in pink.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.770
So we're ready to figure out
what cosine of theta equals.

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:54.610
Cosine of theta is equal to the
adjacent side, that's 3, over

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:59.060
the hypotenuse, which
is this pink side, 5.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.910
Pretty straightforward,
isn't it?

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.320
Let's do another one.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.050
OK, I don't want to
erase the whole thing.

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.670
I just want to erase part of
the page because I want to

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:08.773
keep using this triangle.

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:19.920
OK, one left.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.860
The TOA.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.150
So if you remember what I said
a little while ago-- well,

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.000
we'll figure it out.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.870
But what is the-- oh,
look how big that is.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:37.140
What is the tan of theta,
or the tangent of theta?

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.740
Well, let's go back
to our mnemonic.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.320
TOA, right?

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.510
TOA is for tangent,
or t for tangent.

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:47.630
So it tells us that tangent is
the opposite over the adjacent.

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:54.220
So tan of theta is equal to
opposite over adjacent.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.960
Well, that equals-- what
was the opposite side?

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.360
Right, the opposite side was 4.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.130
And what was the adjacent side?

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:01.780
Well, we just saw that.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.520
It was 3.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:08.890
So the tangent of
this angle is 4/3.

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:10.910
Now let's do another
angle on this.

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:17.180
Let's call this angle
here-- I don't know.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.990
Let's call it x.

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:21.700
I don't know any
other Greek letters.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.840
Let's call that angle x.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.570
So if we want to figure out the
tan of x, let's see if it's

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:29.770
the same as the tan of theta.

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:31.620
The tan of x.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:33.780
Well, now what's
the opposite side?

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.340
Well, now the opposite side
is the white side, right?

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.980
Because opposite this
angle is the 3 side.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:43.890
So we see here tan is opposite
over adjacent, so opposite is

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:48.130
3, and then adjacent is 4.

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:49.910
This is interesting.

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:54.230
The tangent of this angle
is the inverse of the

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:54.830
tangent to that angle.

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:56.520
I don't want to confuse you too
much, but I just want to show

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.930
you that when you take the trig
functions, it matters which

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:03.050
angle of the right angle you're
taking the functions of.

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:05.310
And you might be saying, well,
this is all good and well,

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:06.810
Sal, but what use is this?

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:10.990
Well, we'll later show you that
if you have some of the

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.390
information, so you know an
angle, and you know a side, or

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:15.940
you know a couple of sides, you
can figure out-- and if you

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:20.920
have either a slide ruler or a
trig table or a good

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.320
calculator, you can figure
out-- given the sides of a

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.510
triangle, you can figure out
the angles, or given an angle

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:28.220
and a side, you could
figure out other sides.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:31.010
And we're actually going to
do that in the next module.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:33.020
So, hopefully, this gives you a
little bit of an introduction.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:36.900
I'm almost out of time on the
YouTube 10-minute limit, so I'm

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.130
going to wait to do a couple
more examples in

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:40.840
the next video.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.900
See you in the next
presentation.

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:44.200
Bye!
