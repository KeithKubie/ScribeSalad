00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.330
Some people who have taken psychedelics have
described their experience as entering god

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.610
mode, transcending human perception, or reaching
a higher state of consciousness.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.250
But ... what’s actually going on inside
the brain?

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.430
To find out, a recent study gave volunteers
intravenous doses of either LSD, psilocybin

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:17.430
or ketamine.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.439
Then they did exactly what you’d think they’d
do: lock their tripping volunteers in a loud,

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:23.960
claustrophobic machine to scan their brains.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.599
The researchers found their brain activity
was more random and less integrated, which

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.800
could explain the randomness of thought that
reportedly happens under the influence of

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.800
psychedelics.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.250
They also found that these compounds affected
parts of the brain that deal with perception.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.590
Essentially, parts of the brain that didn’t
normally communicate were saying, “Hey There!,”

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.530
creating what they called a “mixing of the
senses,” sort of like a chemically induced

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.530
synaesthesia.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.780
The researchers called this a “higher state
of consciousness,” which coincidentally

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.620
is what hippies or monks might call this state
of mind.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.360
But the researchers made a point to say that
"higher" does not mean "better" or more "desirable.”

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.579
Instead, this is just the first time we've
measured brain-signal diversity that's higher

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:01.829
than normal.

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.110
And that more research is likely needed!

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.500
Anyone who’s even seen a movie about someone
who’s been on these drugs understands they’re

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.580
experiencing an altered state of consciousness.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.070
But now, we have data.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.640
Ketamine, Psilocybin and LSD have different
pharmacological properties, but in this study,

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.670
they all produced changes in the neural signal
diversity, which is a measure of how complex

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.010
brain activity is.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.920
Ketamine seems to have the widest effect on
the brain, while psilocybin affects only a

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.170
very small section.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.270
In the field of neuroscience, these compounds
are slowly becoming tools to help researchers

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.060
find the molecular basis of consciousness.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.000
Just like sleep research, psychedelics are
a window into the brain at a different state.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.030
For example, in a separate study researchers
found the principal nodes in the brain’s

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.830
default mode network, which is an interconnected
group of brain structures that creates your

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.370
sense of self, are disrupted under the influence
of psilocybin and LSD.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.280
These changes in brain activity are why users
often report a temporary loss of self or “ego

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.280
dissolution.”

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.990
What that means is, the brain’s central
compass, the inner voice you have that drives

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.720
your behavior is quieted.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.950
The neurons that usually work together lose
synchronization, and that is what the researchers

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.050
think creates an entirely different conscious
experience.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.590
We still don’t know what parts of the brain
are responsible for generating consciousness.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.010
I mean, the brain is one of the most complex
structures in the universe with over 100 to

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.050
500 trillion synapses.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.220
We have our work cut out for us.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.069
Understanding how brain activity reorients
could have therapeutic potential.

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.650
The default mode network is overactive in
people who are prone to depression and pessimistic

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.380
patterns of thinking, which is why psilocybin
is being explored as an antidepressant.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.110
And that’s the key for these researchers.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.010
By seeing how the brain lights up under different
drugs and understanding the changes in brain

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.090
activity, there’s hope that these compounds
could alleviate hard to treat neurological

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.489
conditions.

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.600
Psychedelics are a tool to tweak consciousness
and gather more data.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.849
We have so many pictures of normal brains,
but by tweaking things a little (and understanding

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.510
what’s happening), we get better insight
into how the brain does this amazing thing

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.930
that it’s doing for you and me right now.

drugs to have a good time, if by have a good
time you mean see crazy imagined things.
