1
00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.970
This is more perfect. I'm Jad Abumrad this week conversation about a mystery.

2
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.420
It's a mystery actually that's connected to one of my favorite stories we've

3
00:00:08.421 --> 00:00:10.220
done so far. The political thicket,

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.270
<v 1>the political thicken of the court must not enter the political thicket.</v>

5
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.800
And the imagery at the thicket is that, uh, you know,

6
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.280
the deer very proudly with his new horns goes into the thicket,

7
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.360
gets entangled and can never get out.

8
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.620
Frank for years, claim was once the courts are in,

9
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.680
there will be nothing beyond it and someday the courts will be forced to declare

10
00:00:36.531 --> 00:00:39.290
winners and losers. A very high profile elections.

11
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.340
<v 0>If you haven't heard this story, definitely hit pause right now.</v>

12
00:00:42.341 --> 00:00:45.340
Go back in the feed, find the story called political thicket.

13
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.970
Listen to it is definitely one of my favorites. It's essentially a,

14
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.970
the story of a case that many people point to as being the first time that the

15
00:00:54.971 --> 00:00:59.500
supreme court got into politics or soiled themselves with politics,

16
00:00:59.501 --> 00:01:03.160
which you can make a beeline from that moment to Bush v Gore,

17
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.290
that case 1962. It was so traumatic for,

18
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.230
uh, the court that to,

19
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.420
it literally broke two justices like shattered two human beings and one of those

20
00:01:16.601 --> 00:01:17.500
two justices.

21
00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.270
Justice Felix Frankfurter is at the center of the mystery we're about to tell

22
00:01:22.271 --> 00:01:24.910
you about. But just to give you a sense of who he was,

23
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.090
I'm gonna play you a little clip from that earlier story. Um,

24
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.170
he was extremely smart, towering figure, but as a person,

25
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.290
just as friend, just as frankfurter,

26
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.710
<v 1>he wasn't necessarily the nicest person. I heard that from everyone I talk to.</v>

27
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.750
I always call him a Bantam Rooster.

28
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.170
He was a difficult crusty figure who was short.

29
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.450
A little bit of a pouch on him was one of the most condescending egotistical of

30
00:01:52.451 --> 00:01:55.500
justices. So Justice Felix Frankfurter,

31
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.600
<v 0>I'm not the nicest guy, but important,</v>

32
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.650
presided over a ton of really important cases. Like for example,

33
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.150
Brown v Board of Education,

34
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.840
big one where we began the slow march towards desegregating our school system.

35
00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.230
Anyhow, the mystery today deals with his papers.

36
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.220
These are the notes that he took while he was on the bench. You know,

37
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.810
drafts of decisions that he wrote Descente road, a memos,

38
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.240
backs and forth with the other justices.

39
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.720
Maybe the notes he took when they were all in that secret conference room that

40
00:02:28.721 --> 00:02:30.220
they go to when they're arguing.

41
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.640
It's kind of stuff that like people like us are like, aw man,

42
00:02:33.641 --> 00:02:36.870
we gotta get those papers. But this case

43
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.330
there are no papers.

44
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.480
Which brings us to this story of one of the biggest heist in supreme court

45
00:02:45.601 --> 00:02:46.434
history,

46
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.560
the vanishing of Justice Felix Frankfurter's papers from the library of

47
00:02:51.751 --> 00:02:54.990
Congress. One day they were there and then poof, God.

48
00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.110
And ever since people have been like, where, what, where, where are they?

49
00:02:59.111 --> 00:03:02.830
What happened? Who took them? Harvard historian and New Yorker Staff Writer,

50
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.870
Sheila Por who you may remember, Oh,

51
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.880
was a big part of our guns episode we just released.

52
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.390
She recently tried to get to the bottom of this paper Kapor and more perfect

53
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.930
producer Sean Ramas from talk to her about it

54
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.570
<v 1>in such an ecosystem where it's so hard to gain access to these papers,</v>

55
00:03:22.571 --> 00:03:23.560
to these documents.

56
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.130
At some point someone might try to gain access to them unlawfully,

57
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.070
which you once wrote a wonderful story about that.

58
00:03:33.071 --> 00:03:35.190
I was hoping you could maybe retail and I,

59
00:03:35.191 --> 00:03:38.820
I was thinking here we are telling stories so maybe just,

60
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.530
<v 2>yeah, so imagine we're sitting by the fire. Yeah,</v>

61
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.760
you can hear it kind of crackle and there is a,

62
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.960
the evenings crickets field.

63
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:52.660
There it is. There it is.

64
00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.650
So the largest heist in the history of the library of Congress,

65
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.150
I guarantee you would not have guessed because I have not have guessed that it

66
00:04:06.221 --> 00:04:07.870
was a paper to Felix Frankfurter.

67
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.090
More than a thousand pages of Frankfurt papers were stolen from the library of

68
00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:17.110
Congress and that early 1970s they have never been recovered.

69
00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:18.520
Not a single page of them.

70
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.150
It was a kind of extraordinary heist that was investigated by the FBI.

71
00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.040
They had a prime suspect. They can, you know, have,

72
00:04:27.041 --> 00:04:32.041
there was a grand jury called this extensive investigation involved the nation's

73
00:04:32.171 --> 00:04:35.650
leading journalists involved other members of the court,

74
00:04:35.651 --> 00:04:39.550
the nation's leading legal scholars were questioned and were part of the

75
00:04:39.551 --> 00:04:44.260
investigation. The whole thing unraveled days,

76
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.440
hours before the Saturday night massacre and the sort of explosion of Watergate

77
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.750
and was quickly forgotten.

78
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:58.230
<v 1>Hmm. Does all of this, this immense personality, this historic figure,</v>

79
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.610
does this play into why it was his papers that were stolen or were they just the

80
00:05:02.611 --> 00:05:05.490
ones that were in the library at the right time for someone to steal?

81
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.180
<v 2>Yeah, I don't think we know that I,</v>

82
00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.340
unless the mystery really solved and I felt like I got so close.

83
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.480
<v 1>What? What didn't you have to put it all together? Can you reveal that?</v>

84
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.520
<v 2>I guess when you think about it, we're trying to solve a theft.</v>

85
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:27.200
You need to know the motive of the thief and to know the motive of the thief,

86
00:05:27.201 --> 00:05:31.850
you need to know what was stolen. But in Frankfurter's case,

87
00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.200
his papers had only really just got to the library of Congress,

88
00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.930
so when the papers disappeared for a long time,

89
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.470
nobody even noticed it because they hadn't really processed and they shouldn't

90
00:05:42.471 --> 00:05:45.770
probably have been letting people look at them because it's then you can,

91
00:05:45.771 --> 00:05:49.580
it's hard to reconstruct what's missing. What's clear from what was missing.

92
00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.440
Of these more than a thousand pages is that it was the best stuff.

93
00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.930
And so one theory that the FBI early on was some was trying to make money cause

94
00:05:59.931 --> 00:06:04.220
you could like all of it frankfurters corresponds with Lyndon Johnson for

95
00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:07.940
instance, was missing and we were like, all right, this presidential signature,

96
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.320
you could sell that. I mean,

97
00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:10.850
where are you going to sell these things is another question.

98
00:06:10.851 --> 00:06:12.410
But like maybe that's what was the case,

99
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.370
the next theory that the library working with the FBI had was, okay,

100
00:06:16.371 --> 00:06:18.680
so it's a scholar

101
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.460
and a scholar who just, who wants to have it,

102
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.840
like wants to have this stuff and doesn't want anybody else to have it.

103
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.040
Like a collector or something like, oh yeah, like go just, you know,

104
00:06:34.041 --> 00:06:35.360
sometimes when you, um,

105
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:37.670
when you're working on a project just for like a journalist,

106
00:06:37.671 --> 00:06:39.770
you don't want to be scooped scholars of the same thing.

107
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:41.930
Maybe finds out something incredibly juicy.

108
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:46.070
Like imagine that someone's reading Frankfurter's diary and finds out,

109
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:50.510
Okay Frankfurter [inaudible] I slept with William Douglas,

110
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.610
his wife or something. I don't know what it would be like.

111
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:57.290
There's some big afraid for fixing finger.

112
00:06:57.291 --> 00:06:58.820
He's gonna like rule against him forever.

113
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.550
And you know like just something that you need to be like,

114
00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.430
I'm going to write a biography of Frankfurter and this is how I'm going to sell

115
00:07:04.431 --> 00:07:08.270
it. Right. So the last thing you would want would be for another scholar go,

116
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.080
I've had this, I have find things in the archives all the time. Shoot,

117
00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.290
they put it back in the box and you give it back to the librarian and you know

118
00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:18.050
it's, someone else is going to call her on, never going to get this out in time.

119
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:21.500
And you just kind of forget about it. Cause as you can imagine,

120
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:22.880
it's just too cool. Someone else going to find it.

121
00:07:22.881 --> 00:07:27.150
So maybe someone like that like that you could imagine a journalist just aren't

122
00:07:27.151 --> 00:07:30.380
you? We can imagine this person, right? Sure. And they would just can't resist.

123
00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:34.200
And there was no security in the library of Congress at the time. But I taught,

124
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:37.270
I interviewed everybody who was investigated by the FBI and they,

125
00:07:37.271 --> 00:07:39.730
these hilarious stories, they're like, yeah, well they had a photocopy,

126
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.730
they're like a xerox machine, like an early xerox machine,

127
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:46.700
and you like put a nickel in it, but they would just let you take folders down.

128
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.990
It was like down the hall and up a set of stairs and through a double doors and

129
00:07:49.991 --> 00:07:51.970
go through the bathroom and out the back door of the bathroom.

130
00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:53.370
And there was this one xerox machine,

131
00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:57.410
you can put a nickel in and you just walk out the door with your folders and

132
00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:01.600
like, you can't do that anymore. Not Elaborate. Congas really not anywhere.

133
00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:05.020
And it was this case that actually led to a crackdown.

134
00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:10.290
So the FBI quickly came to the conclusion that whoever had bothered to do the

135
00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.640
incredible labor of steel and all those papers,

136
00:08:15.641 --> 00:08:19.810
because a lot of smuggling would've been someone who both really wanted to write

137
00:08:19.811 --> 00:08:20.021
about.

138
00:08:20.021 --> 00:08:25.021
Frankfurter had found something incredibly juicy but had been thwarted by the

139
00:08:26.711 --> 00:08:30.640
kind of cabal of Frankfurt or people, which was,

140
00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:35.910
these people are called the hot dogs where the

141
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:43.200
best thing we're sitting by the campfire now is when the hot dogs go on the,

142
00:08:43.201 --> 00:08:47.190
like we've been sharpening our wooden sticks, our green wooden sticks.

143
00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:50.040
Now you put on the hugs and roast them.

144
00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:52.710
The hot dogs are the former clerks of Frankfurt.

145
00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:57.390
They were known as the hot dogs and loved him because like many an ordinary

146
00:08:57.391 --> 00:09:01.400
person, you know, apparently it was just a very stand up person to work with Hm.

147
00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:04.340
When you're on the inside. And they were con, you know,

148
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:06.600
kind of protecting his legacy. Anyway,

149
00:09:06.601 --> 00:09:10.230
so the case just kind of just get steamrolled by Watergate.

150
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:14.250
But this is kind of like the Alex Jones theory of the Felix frame.

151
00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:19.740
It's not that it is not the, no, it's not stupid fairness.

152
00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:24.600
Cause actually there are two incredibly, uh, diligent legal scholars, peace,

153
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:28.980
peace, this element of this story together. Um, and I, uh, it's,

154
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:33.630
it's a little conspiracy theory minded, but it's not beyond the pale.

155
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.430
So one of the pieces of paper that appears to have been missing from

156
00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:39.690
Frankfurter's papers

157
00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:46.490
is really interesting and was potentially quite damaging to William Rehnquist,

158
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:50.850
who had been nominated to serve on the court and whose

159
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:57.000
confirmation proceedings were happening right at the time that Frankfurter's

160
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:59.490
papers were ransacked.

161
00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:05.510
What was controversial for Rehnquist was the issue that had thwarted Nixon's

162
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.320
earlier judicial appointments,

163
00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:14.820
which was his relationship to segregation. Nixon, who you will recall,

164
00:10:14.821 --> 00:10:19.821
was pursuing a southern strategy trying to a white southern Democrats had

165
00:10:19.981 --> 00:10:23.640
nominated some potential justices who were segregationists or certainly had been

166
00:10:23.641 --> 00:10:26.580
segregationists earlier in their career. In any case, Rehnquist was not,

167
00:10:26.581 --> 00:10:31.110
but rank was served as a clerk for Robert Jackson in 1950s and asked by Jackson

168
00:10:31.111 --> 00:10:33.000
to prepare a memo about Brown v Board.

169
00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:35.460
Rankest had written a memo in which he wrote,

170
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:40.320
I realize it is an unpopular and on humanitarian position for which I have been

171
00:10:40.321 --> 00:10:42.270
excoriated by liberal colleagues,

172
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:46.020
but I think Plessy v Ferguson was right and should be reaffirmed.

173
00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:50.150
Plessy v Ferguson, the 1896 decision, uh,

174
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:55.170
instituted the legal principle of separate but equal the establish the system of

175
00:10:55.171 --> 00:10:59.390
Jim Crow, legalize a system of Jim Crow. And so it's published, you know,

176
00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:01.950
in Newsweek and then it'd be becomes explosive.

177
00:11:01.951 --> 00:11:04.440
And a real big problem for rank was during his confirmation

178
00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:10.350
rank was worked very hard to quiet that storm. He said,

179
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:12.960
I wasn't expressing my own views.

180
00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:17.340
I was asked to write a memo about Justice Jackson's views

181
00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.920
and Jackson's secretary, former Secretary Elsie Douglas,

182
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.800
she told reporters that's just a lie.

183
00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:30.780
Like Jacqueline didn't ask his clerks to write down memos about what Jackson

184
00:11:30.781 --> 00:11:32.070
should think. Jackson knew what he thought.

185
00:11:32.071 --> 00:11:36.480
He asked his clerks to tell him what they thought so he could elaborate,

186
00:11:36.481 --> 00:11:36.730
you know,

187
00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:39.090
that he could kind of deliberate on the multiple positions that they would

188
00:11:39.091 --> 00:11:42.990
present him with. So rank was, sends a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee,

189
00:11:42.991 --> 00:11:44.640
tried to explain all of this.

190
00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:49.500
And Senate Judiciary Committee threatens to hold hearings over the holiday or

191
00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.320
after Christmas. This is December of 1971. Uh,

192
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:56.470
Nixon starts putting pressure on, on senators.

193
00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:02.200
And you can imagine somebody at this point might've thought, I wonder,

194
00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.030
well if there's anything in frankfurters papers,

195
00:12:04.031 --> 00:12:05.740
which are huge ones you've just been given to the, you know,

196
00:12:05.741 --> 00:12:08.890
recently given to the library of Congress that would cast light on the Rehnquist

197
00:12:08.891 --> 00:12:09.724
nomination.

198
00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:15.280
And one of the things that is no longer in frankfurters papers but appears to

199
00:12:15.281 --> 00:12:16.940
have been both from before the law,

200
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:21.990
the theft is a letter that Rehnquist wrote to Frankfurter in 1955 on the

201
00:12:22.211 --> 00:12:26.440
question of segregation. The memo to Jackson was from 1952.

202
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:29.380
Uh, and there are these two legal scholars,

203
00:12:29.381 --> 00:12:33.820
Brad Snyder and John Barrett who argue that bankwest would have revisited the

204
00:12:33.821 --> 00:12:38.821
arguments that he made in 1952 in that letter to frankfurter and it someone from

205
00:12:38.831 --> 00:12:43.260
the FBI or from the Nixon White House or one of the White House plumbers or any

206
00:12:43.261 --> 00:12:48.150
of these nefarious people could have been told by Nixon, by Haldeman,

207
00:12:48.151 --> 00:12:51.010
by you know, any of these jokes. Christian the way Nixon White House,

208
00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:55.060
get yourself together as down love of Congress and pull anything from Rehnquist,

209
00:12:55.061 --> 00:12:57.040
from frankfurters papers. But to hide your tracks.

210
00:12:57.041 --> 00:12:59.610
Just take a bunch of that crap out. You know, we didn't want,

211
00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:00.250
we want to make it,

212
00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:03.040
we want to make look like someone actually stole Frankfurter's papers.

213
00:13:03.041 --> 00:13:04.900
Like as if anybody came. You know what I mean? Like that.

214
00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:08.530
It was the whole thing was yet another Watergate coverup, you know,

215
00:13:08.531 --> 00:13:12.010
yet another not a dirty trick, which is kind of a cool theory isn't it?

216
00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.690
<v 1>It's great. It's great.</v>

217
00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:18.840
Is that conspiracy theory also to you in your eyes the most credible or do you,

218
00:13:19.121 --> 00:13:21.460
do you have an alternate theory of who may have taken them?

219
00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:27.250
Do you think it could have been just some nebbish academic or or biographer?

220
00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:32.790
<v 2>I do have a theory, a fair amount of evidence for that theory. Okay.</v>

221
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:34.920
I can't tell you that theory.

222
00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:36.843
<v 1>Ah,</v>

223
00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:42.070
<v 2>and in that theory we are disappointed to learn that it is very unlikely that</v>

224
00:13:42.621 --> 00:13:43.700
the papers still exist.

225
00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:49.330
The FBI had a prime suspect who denied any involvement and did not accept an

226
00:13:49.521 --> 00:13:52.490
offer for kind of amnesty in exchange for returning the papers.

227
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.440
So although you know,

228
00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:59.270
they tended to believe that that person probably had the papers.

229
00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:03.050
The FBI never made an arrest. The FBI absolutely never made an arrest,

230
00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:05.060
and they talked to a lot of people. They did.

231
00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:09.190
They did take the investigation really seriously. But on the other hand,

232
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:13.090
if the FBI had conducted the heist in the first place,

233
00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:16.590
wouldn't their investigation had been just designed to cover up? Sure.

234
00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:19.600
But they were the culprits who would have to be thorough. Yeah, right. I mean,

235
00:14:19.601 --> 00:14:20.411
they're not going to be like, oh,

236
00:14:20.411 --> 00:14:22.600
the library of Congress calls and Frankfurter's papers are missing.

237
00:14:22.601 --> 00:14:25.930
It'd be like, Hey, we're too busy. Because that would look that,

238
00:14:25.931 --> 00:14:29.590
that would look very suspicious if they'd taken them. I love that theory.

239
00:14:29.591 --> 00:14:33.510
I didn't think fun theory. That explains a lot. It's great, but,

240
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.910
but there's very little evidence. I'm just going to be completely clear.

241
00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.090
There's almost no evidence where, what's her?

242
00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:42.940
It's just that the timeline works out. It's a little but like, hmm.

243
00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.930
You know how the New York Times published that timeline of the kind of, Oh,

244
00:14:46.931 --> 00:14:51.931
this is the day that Donald Trump jr met with Natalia and this is the day that

245
00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:55.700
wikileaks published that you know the timeline lines up beautifully,

246
00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:56.960
but that is not enough.

247
00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:05.483
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

248
00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:11.070
<v 0>coming up. We'll take a step back and ask, how in the world did this happen?</v>

249
00:15:11.071 --> 00:15:15.840
Could this happen? Like who gets to decide what happens to these courts

250
00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:19.500
<v 4>papers, this bit of history that's coming up.</v>

251
00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:27.540
<v 5>He's from Washington, from snap, snap, duck live walks,</v>

252
00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:32.130
Nashville's Wyman theater in March 16th and I'm bringing the best cars in the

253
00:15:32.131 --> 00:15:36.780
world. Pride laughs, a more amazing night out. And yes,

254
00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:40.470
she's coming. The funniest woman in the world. Jen Kober

255
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:46.140
[inaudible] in the lady forest. Jen POBA rocks a brand new story.

256
00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:49.050
Get tickets. It's snap judgement. That'll org.

257
00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:51.610
I've never gotten applause for it before. If you guys

258
00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.380
<v 0>call my mom, that'd be awesome. She's still pissed.</v>

259
00:15:58.790 --> 00:15:59.571
This is more perfect.

260
00:15:59.571 --> 00:16:03.920
I'm Jad Abumrad back to our conversation with more perfect producers.

261
00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:08.300
Sean rums from and Harvard Historian and New Yorker Staff Writer, Gillette Por.

262
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:09.711
So,

263
00:16:09.711 --> 00:16:13.160
so what's the supreme court's official policy and all the papers that go through

264
00:16:13.161 --> 00:16:14.510
the Supreme Court? What do they do with all that?

265
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.180
<v 2>The Supreme Court's official policy as it is none of your business.</v>

266
00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:22.230
It's very surprised myself was frankly surprised to discover this,

267
00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:24.600
that the national records act,

268
00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:29.640
presidential records act legislation that protects the other papers of the

269
00:16:31.051 --> 00:16:34.770
federal government specifically excludes the Supreme Court.

270
00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:39.120
So what happens is completely up to the justices, including most importantly,

271
00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:44.690
the discussions that the judges have in conference and their notes from those

272
00:16:45.031 --> 00:16:49.530
discussions and the papers that their clerks assemble for them and preparing how

273
00:16:49.531 --> 00:16:54.531
to consider a case or preparing for a case that they decide not to consider.

274
00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:57.550
It's completely the discretion of the justice,

275
00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:01.950
whether to preserve that for the future for historians, for the public,

276
00:17:01.951 --> 00:17:06.300
for that matter, for journalists, they could destroy it all and they often do.

277
00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:10.590
And how far back to this date? Eight goes back to John Marshall,

278
00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:13.320
who's one of the most important chief justices.

279
00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:17.370
Marshall was an incredibly effective leader of the court, but he,

280
00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:20.310
under his tenure, the court gained an enormous amount of stature.

281
00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:25.550
But he really believed that for the justices to be able to confer with full

282
00:17:27.901 --> 00:17:28.734
candor,

283
00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:33.480
their deliberations needed to be secret in perpetuity.

284
00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:35.930
A lot of people at the time opposed at Jefferson in particular,

285
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:37.230
that it was completely inexcusable.

286
00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:40.710
That of really important value in a republic is transparency.

287
00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:44.910
And Marshall was essentially making a power grab [inaudible] he loved the idea

288
00:17:44.911 --> 00:17:48.480
of the mystery of the court and the mystique of the courtroom. He was a great,

289
00:17:48.481 --> 00:17:51.230
he's a great of power. So, um,

290
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:54.960
the tradition dates from Marshall and they were very strong arguments to be made

291
00:17:54.961 --> 00:17:57.990
in favor of the deliberations being kept secret,

292
00:17:57.991 --> 00:18:00.180
I think certainly for a period of time,

293
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:05.130
but that we should never know what was behind these decisions,

294
00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:09.500
whose I think from the vantage of a historian, ah,

295
00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:14.880
that's not okay. Um, but from the, the political principle I,

296
00:18:14.881 --> 00:18:16.920
that there are strong debates on the other side,

297
00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:20.100
there's a strong argument to be made that there is, that it is indefensible.

298
00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:24.210
First of all, they can decide to save nothing. They can burn their papers,

299
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:28.320
has no small number of them, have indeed done second,

300
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:31.800
they can decide they're gonna give their papers to an archive,

301
00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:36.540
then they can give it to a really inconvenient archive. Um,

302
00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:38.550
let's say there's a rule and there's nine justices.

303
00:18:38.551 --> 00:18:42.970
You want to read each of their conference notes and see the pain,

304
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.540
the folders that they assembled, the papers about the case.

305
00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:49.880
He could very well have to go to many, far from places, which that is,

306
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.740
doesn't seem maybe that inconvenient maybe to your listeners,

307
00:18:52.741 --> 00:18:57.240
but it's hard work being storying and getting enough money to even get to these

308
00:18:57.241 --> 00:18:58.620
places hard. Uh,

309
00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:03.770
but these are people whose career has been spent paid by taxpayer funds to do

310
00:19:05.551 --> 00:19:09.290
the work of the federal government. And these,

311
00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:12.480
the portion of their papers that concerns the work they did for the federal

312
00:19:12.481 --> 00:19:16.650
government. A lot of people might say prolongs to the public.

313
00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:21.390
My own view is it is indefensible that the court has no policy with regard to

314
00:19:21.391 --> 00:19:25.380
court related papers of it's justices. They're rules people.

315
00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:27.230
These people can't set a rule for themselves in the,

316
00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:30.550
but I understand they don't want congress sitting a rule about it, that,

317
00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:32.820
that for them that falls under a separation of powers issue.

318
00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:35.490
But they should have the rule and the rule just shouldn't be.

319
00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.340
You can have your kids decide to burn all of your papers when you die.

320
00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:43.110
What do you think it would take for such a rule at this point to be past?

321
00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:45.150
I would have thought, honestly,

322
00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:49.920
that it might've come in the aftermath of the Bush v Gore decision in 2000 when

323
00:19:49.921 --> 00:19:53.130
people might've said, do you know what? Supreme Court is really powerful.

324
00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.140
And in an era of judicial supremacy,

325
00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:59.670
we actually need the supreme court to be saving his papers because future

326
00:19:59.671 --> 00:20:04.671
generations need to understand by what means did those nine people come to that

327
00:20:04.801 --> 00:20:05.634
decision?

328
00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:08.443
<v 6>Um,</v>

329
00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:16.210
<v 7>if you could steal the papers of any Supreme Court justice living or dead or</v>

330
00:20:16.251 --> 00:20:20.060
just, you know, borrow for a weekend to pour over, who's would you steal?

331
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:23.420
Oh my gosh, that's a good question.

332
00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:31.400
I'm going to just go for the gold here. [inaudible] John Marshall Classic.

333
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:35.540
Yeah. Just the kind of original guy. He was Jefferson's cousin.

334
00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:39.560
He started on the bench with Bushrod, Washington, George Washington's cousin.

335
00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:44.990
These guys were making momentous decisions early on, you know Madison Beam,

336
00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:49.150
the Marbury. What did he rank people into that? Huh? Who Cares about me?

337
00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:52.720
Isn't that I don't really want it. Was he like,

338
00:20:52.721 --> 00:20:56.050
was he sleeping with the boarding house sown and you chose you to be the guy who

339
00:20:56.051 --> 00:20:59.230
like invented the Supreme Court? That's a good choice. That's a good choice.

340
00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:01.810
I'm prepared to defend it. Second choice feelings

341

if you want to learn more about this,

343
00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:12.970
definitely check out an article that she wrote in The New Yorker called the

344
00:21:12.971 --> 00:21:15.100
great paper Caper. By the way,

345
00:21:15.101 --> 00:21:18.580
a Bushrod Washington was George Washington's nephew, not cousin, but whatever.
