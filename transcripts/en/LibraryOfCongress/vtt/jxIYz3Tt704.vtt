PODIUMS SO I'M GOING TO GO SIT 
WITH MY FRIENDS, AND WE ARE

GOING TO HAVE A CHAT.
I HAVE GIVEN THEM A SNEAK PEEK 

00:14:33.853 --> 00:14:37.577
INTO QUESTIONS, BUT THE IDEA IS 
FOR US TO INTERRUPT EACH OTHER, 

00:14:37.578 --> 00:14:42.266
TO ADD TO EACH OTHER'S COMMENTS,
TO TAKE US ON WILD EXCURSIONS 

00:14:42.267 --> 00:14:47.566
AWAY FROM THESE QUESTIONS.
YOU KNOW, IT'S FREE-FLOWING AND 

00:14:47.567 --> 00:14:50.611
I THINK THEY'RE GAME BECAUSE 
THEY'RE ALL BOOK PEOPLE AND THEY

00:14:50.612 --> 00:14:52.677
LOVE US, SO I SAY WE'RE IN, 
OKAY?

00:14:53.694 --> 00:14:55.694
ALL RIGHT, HERE I GO.
[ APPLAUSE ]

00:14:57.965 --> 00:14:59.965
OKAY, IS MY MIC ON?
YOU CAN HEAR ME.

00:15:00.828 --> 00:15:02.828
OKAY, SO THE FIRST THING I WAS 

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:06.726
CURIOUS ABOUT, BECAUSE ALL OF 
YOUR NOVELS WERE -- HAD SUCH 

00:15:06.727 --> 00:15:08.727
VOICE, ALL OF THEM.

00:15:11.814 --> 00:15:14.266
WE HAVE A NOVEL ABOUT A GIRL AT 
THE TIME OF PARTITION, WRITING A

00:15:14.267 --> 00:15:16.908
DIARY TO HER MOM WHO'S NO LONGER
LIVING.

00:15:18.267 --> 00:15:20.332
WE HAVE A BOY TRYING TO MAKE 
SENSE OF HIS LIFE AND HIS FAMILY

00:15:20.333 --> 00:15:23.366
AND HIS IDENTITY.
WE HAVE A GIRL STRUGGLING WITH 

00:15:23.367 --> 00:15:28.242
HER MOTHER'S SUICIDE.
WE HAVE A STORY OF A GIRL TRYING

00:15:28.243 --> 00:15:31.493
TO MAKE SENSE AND DISCOVER THE 
REASONS BEHIND THE DISAPPEARANCE

00:15:31.494 --> 00:15:35.572
OF A DEAR FRIEND.
AND WHAT CAME ACROSS TO ME FOR 

00:15:35.573 --> 00:15:37.612
ALL OF THEM IS JUST THE SENSE OF
VOICE.

00:15:38.831 --> 00:15:41.086
I THINK THE FIRST THING I WANT 
TO ASK YOU IS, FOR YOU, IN YOUR 

00:15:41.087 --> 00:15:44.786
NOVELS, WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS 
PERSON THAT WAS GOING TO LEAD 

00:15:44.787 --> 00:15:47.838
THAT NOVEL?
WHERE WAS YOUR PROTAGONIST?

00:15:49.291 --> 00:15:51.343
HOW DID YOU FIND THEM?
DID YOU FIND STORY FIRST, OR THE

00:15:51.344 --> 00:15:53.376
PERSON FIRST?
GIVE US SOME SENSE OF THAT.

00:15:56.648 --> 00:15:57.878
AND I'M GOING TO PICK ON POOR 
TIFFANY.

00:15:57.879 --> 00:16:01.180
YOU'RE CLOSEST.
SHE'S LIKE NO, NO, NOT ME, NOT 

00:16:01.181 --> 00:16:04.026
ME CLAM.
&gt;&gt; I WAS SNEAKILY TRYING TO SAY 

00:16:04.027 --> 00:16:09.945
IT WITH MY EYES, LIKE "NO."
SO THE MAIN PROTAGONIST IN 

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:15.849
MONDAY'S NOT COMING HER NAME IS 
CLAUDIA, AND HONESTLY I SORT OF 

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:18.287
DIALED INTO MYSELF, ME AS A 
CHILD.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.980
I WAS A RELATIVELY SHY CHILD.
I HAD A BEST FRIEND.

00:16:24.055 --> 00:16:26.055
I DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO SHARE 
WITH ANYONE.

00:16:26.731 --> 00:16:28.731
I STILL DON'T LIKE TO SHARE MY 
TOYS TODAY.

00:16:30.612 --> 00:16:32.246
I ALSO HAD A LEARNING 
DISABILITY, AND I LIVED IN MY 

00:16:32.247 --> 00:16:35.703
OWN BUBBLE, SO IT WAS REALLY 
ACTUALLY EASY FOR ME TO WRITE 

00:16:35.704 --> 00:16:38.800
SOMETHING LIKE THIS, BECAUSE IT 
WAS EASY FOR ME TO JUST DIAL 

00:16:38.801 --> 00:16:41.049
INTO MY OWN PERSONAL 

00:16:44.158 --> 00:16:46.177
EXPERIENCES, TO FIND THAT KID 
THAT I PRETENDED NOT TO BE, BUT 

00:16:46.178 --> 00:16:50.115
I TRULY WAS WHEN I LOOK BACK ON 
HER.

00:16:50.336 --> 00:16:52.992
&gt;&gt; ANYBODY ELSE?
WHERE DID YOU FIND YOURSELF?

00:16:54.836 --> 00:16:57.146
&gt;&gt; FOR ME, I STARTED WITH THE 
STORY, WHICH IS I KNOW VERY ODD 

00:16:57.147 --> 00:17:00.413
BECAUSE THE BOOK IS SO 
CHARACTER-DRIVEN BUT I KNEW THAT

00:17:03.466 --> 00:17:05.466
I WANTED TO WRITE ABOUT A GIRL 
WHO WAS HEARING HER 

00:17:05.899 --> 00:17:07.934
GRANDMOTHER'S STORIES FOR THE 
FIRST TIME BECAUSE MY 

00:17:10.176 --> 00:17:12.176
GRANDMOTHER IN MY BOOK IS 
SHAMELESSLY RIPPED OFF MY 

00:17:13.419 --> 00:17:15.858
GRANDMOTHER, LIKE BASICALLY 
COPY/PASTE SO I HAD THIS GAP OF 

00:17:15.859 --> 00:17:19.125
THIS CHARACTER TO FILL IN.
THEN IT TOOK ME MANY YEARS TO 

00:17:19.126 --> 00:17:23.002
START TO DIVE INTO MYSELF.
IT TOOK ME A REALLY LONG TIME TO

00:17:23.003 --> 00:17:26.086
BE WILLING TO GO THERE.
I THINK I WAS REALLY AFRAID AT 

00:17:26.087 --> 00:17:28.133
FIRST.
I THINK IN THE BEGINNING, I WAS 

00:17:28.134 --> 00:17:31.176
LIKE, OH, I'M GOING TO WRITE 
ABOUT THIS TOTALLY FICTIONAL 

00:17:31.177 --> 00:17:34.649
PERSON, COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 
FROM ME, BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT 

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:39.384
TO THE DIG UP SHADOWS AND 
EXPLORE ALL THESE THINGS THAT 

00:17:39.385 --> 00:17:43.260
WERE CONFLICTS IN MY BRAIN, WERE
THINGS I WAS TRYING TO WRESTLE 

00:17:43.261 --> 00:17:45.905
WITH MYSELF.
AND SO THAT WAS AN INTERESTING 

00:17:45.906 --> 00:17:48.142
PROCESS.
I WROTE MANY, MANY DRAFTS AND 

00:17:48.143 --> 00:17:51.399
FINALLY ARRIVED AT A PLACE WHERE
I WAS LIKE, OH, I HAVE TO TALK 

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:56.694
ABOUT ME AND MY EXPERIENCE WITH 
MY FAMILY, AND WHAT IT FELT LIKE

00:17:56.695 --> 00:17:59.965
TO STRADDLE DIFFERENT IDENTITIES
GROWING UP.

00:18:00.992 --> 00:18:03.217
&gt;&gt; SO THAT WAS THE THING THAT 
WAS KEEPING YOU, THAT NOTION OF 

00:18:03.218 --> 00:18:06.712
IDENTITY AND FEAR?
WAS THAT -- AM I HEARING THAT 

00:18:06.713 --> 00:18:08.920
RIGHT?
&gt;&gt; YEAH, I MEAN, IN ORIGINAL 

00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:13.431
DRAFTS OF THE BOOK, MY CHARACTER
WAS VERY, VERY -- EVERY SINGLE 

00:18:13.432 --> 00:18:16.492
TIME I REWROTE THE BOOK IT WAS 
COMPLETELY A DIFFERENT CAST OF 

00:18:16.493 --> 00:18:18.917
CHARACTERS EXCEPT FOR THE 
GRANDMOTHER'S CHARACTER BECAUSE 

00:18:18.918 --> 00:18:21.964
SHE WAS MY GRANDMOTHER.
&gt;&gt; EMILY, THAT'S A LOT OF PAGES.

00:18:21.965 --> 00:18:26.031
&gt;&gt; IT IS A LOT OF PAGES AND A 
LOT OF CHARACTERS AND WHEN I 

00:18:26.032 --> 00:18:29.908
FINALLY LANDED UPON LEE'S 
CHARACTER, IT BECAME THIS WAY OF

00:18:29.909 --> 00:18:33.392
EXPRESSING AND EXPLORING ALL 
THESE THINGS THAT I DIDN'T EVEN 

00:18:33.393 --> 00:18:37.297
REALIZE I WAS STILL WRESTLING 
WITH FROM MY CHILDHOOD OF NOT 

00:18:37.298 --> 00:18:40.379
QUITE FITTING INTO THIS CULTURE 
AND NOT QUITE FITTING INTO THAT 

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:42.828
CULTURE AND TRYING TO FIND MY 
PLACE IN THE WORLD.

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:47.929
&gt;&gt; AND HOW ABOUT,.
&gt;&gt; THEY CALL ME BUERO DIDN'T 

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:51.799
BEGIN AS A NOVEL AT FIRST.
IT WAS MEANT TO BE A CHARACTER 

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.452
STUDY, A CHECK TON HARD OF 
HEARING SHUN OF POEMS IN A BOY'S

00:18:54.453 --> 00:18:58.131
VOICE TO GET ACROSS THE 
COMPLEXITY OF THE MEXICAN 

00:18:59.367 --> 00:19:01.006
AMERICAN IDENTITY AND TRY TO 
BREAK WITH THE STEREOTYPES AND 

00:19:01.007 --> 00:19:04.508
PUSH BACK AGAINST SOME OF THE 
NOISE WE HEAR IN SOCIETY RIGHT 

00:19:04.509 --> 00:19:06.509
NOW.

00:19:08.926 --> 00:19:10.552
THE FIRST POEM I WROTE, IT WAS 
BEFORE I THOUGHT OF THE IDEA OF 

00:19:10.553 --> 00:19:15.917
THE BOOK, IT WAS A POEM CALLED 
BORDER KID FOR AN ANTHOLOGY 

00:19:17.339 --> 00:19:18.761
RIGHT AFTER THE ELECTION THAT 
HELPED KIDS OF COLOR WHO WERE 

00:19:18.762 --> 00:19:21.806
KIND OF DISTRAUGHT ABOUT THE 
THINGS THEY WERE HEARING, THE 

00:19:21.807 --> 00:19:26.314
LEADERS OF OUR COUNTRY SAYING, 
TO GRAPPLE WITH THEIR ANXIETY 

00:19:26.315 --> 00:19:30.174
THROUGH POETRY SO I WROTE THIS 
POEM CALLED BORDER KID, AND IT 

00:19:30.175 --> 00:19:33.030
WAS REPRINTED IN THE JOURNAL OF 
CHILDREN'S LITERATURE AND I READ

00:19:33.031 --> 00:19:36.481
IT WHEN I WAS INDUCTED INTO THE 
TEXAS INSTITUTE OF LETTERS AND 

00:19:36.482 --> 00:19:39.745
AS I WAS COMING DOWN OFF THE 
STAGE AN EDITOR CAME UP TO ME 

00:19:39.746 --> 00:19:43.638
AND SAID I LOVE THAT POEM AND IF
YOU CAN WRITE ANOTHER 50 POEMS 

00:19:43.639 --> 00:19:46.522
IN THAT KID'S VOICE.
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:19:48.577 --> 00:19:50.577
-- I'LL PUBLISH IT.
THAT WAS NOT ON MY WRITING 

00:19:54.087 --> 00:19:55.935
CALENDAR, BUT -- SO I SAT DOWN 
AND STARTED TRYING TO FIND OUT 

00:19:55.936 --> 00:19:59.649
WHO THIS KID WAS, AND I REALIZED
THAT WHILE HIS IDENTITY 

00:20:01.719 --> 00:20:04.370
INTERSECTED WITH MINE, HE WAS 
ALSO PARTLY MY SON, PARTLY THE 

00:20:04.371 --> 00:20:08.232
BOYS THAT I HAD TAUGHT WHEN I 
WAS A MIDDLE-SCHOOL TEACHER FOR 

00:20:08.233 --> 00:20:13.176
9 YEARS, PARTLY JUST THE 
OTHER -- MY COUSINS AND OTHER 

00:20:17.209 --> 00:20:19.209
MUCH

00:20:21.145 --> 00:20:23.605
ASOS, AND BIT BY BIT THIS 
COMPLEX REAL HUMAN CHARACTER 

00:20:23.606 --> 00:20:27.889
JUST BLOSSOMED AND AFTER A WHILE
I HEARD HIS VOICE THAT THE POEMS

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:29.890
CAME NATURALLY AND POURED OUT OF
ME.

00:20:31.627 --> 00:20:33.627
IT'S A GIFT WHEN THAT HAPPENS 

00:20:35.943 --> 00:20:38.382
AND THAT'S AN AMALGAMATION OF 
ALL THESE WONDERFUL THINGS ABOUT

00:20:38.383 --> 00:20:40.629
BEING A MEXICAN AMERICAN BOY ON 

00:20:43.716 --> 00:20:45.716
THE BORDER, A KID WHO'S KIND OF 
A NERD.

00:20:47.619 --> 00:20:49.711
HE'S MISCHIEVOUS, BUT HE HAS A 
GOOD HEART, HE DOESN'T MEAN ANY 

00:20:49.712 --> 00:20:53.173
REAL MALICE ABOUT IT.
HE'S BEGINNING TO FALL IN LOVE 

00:20:53.174 --> 00:20:56.626
THE FIRST TIME AND HE'S DEEPLY 
ROOTED IN HIS COMMUNITY BUT HE'S

00:20:56.627 --> 00:21:01.334
A MEXICAN AMERICAN KID IN 2019 
SO HE'S GRAPPLING WITH ALL KINDS

00:21:01.335 --> 00:21:05.027
OF BULLYING AT THE LOCAL AND 
NATIONAL LEVEL.

00:21:06.857 --> 00:21:08.279
HE HAS A TEACHER WHO HELPS HIM 
DISCOVER IT AND HE FINDS HIS 

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:12.364
VOICE AND I FOUND HIS VOICE AND 
IT'S NICE FOR THAT TO HAPPEN.

00:21:12.365 --> 00:21:16.229
&gt;&gt; THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE 50 POEMS 
IS HARD TO WRITE WITHOUT A 

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:18.266
VOICE.
HE CAME THROUGH.

00:21:20.098 --> 00:21:22.344
VEERA, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
&gt;&gt; THAT IDEA OF SORT OF FINDING 

00:21:22.345 --> 00:21:25.397
YOUR VOICE AND FINDING YOUR 
CHARACTER'S VOICE AND IT'S SORT 

00:21:25.398 --> 00:21:28.720
OF TWO DIFFERENT -- AND THEN 
YOUR CHARACTER FINDING THEIR 

00:21:28.721 --> 00:21:31.771
VOICE.
THERE ARE ALL THESE LAYERS OF 

00:21:31.772 --> 00:21:36.036
VOICE YOU'RE UNEARTHING AND I 
STARTED THE NIGHT DIARY KIND OF 

00:21:36.037 --> 00:21:39.915
REALLY WAY BACK, AND I KNEW THAT
I WANTED TO WRITE A STORY ABOUT 

00:21:39.916 --> 00:21:44.183
THE 1947 PARTITION OF INDIA.
I WANTED IT TO BE INSPIRED BY MY

00:21:48.249 --> 00:21:49.870
OWN FATHER'S EXPERIENCES AND MY 
FATHER'S FAMILY'S EXPERIENCES 

00:21:49.871 --> 00:21:54.908
BUT I REALLY WASN'T SURE HOW TO 
ACCESS IT AND SO I STARTED 

00:21:57.381 --> 00:21:59.381
ACTUALLY WITH A YOUNG MALE 

00:22:00.385 --> 00:22:02.478
CHARACTER AND I WAS IN THIRD 
PERSON.

00:22:04.335 --> 00:22:05.949
MY VERY EARLY SKETCHES AND AS I 
WAS KIND OF WRITING PIECES I 

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:10.426
REALIZED I WAS TRYING TO WRITE 
MY FATHER'S STORY WHICH IS NOT 

00:22:10.427 --> 00:22:13.533
REALLY WHAT I WANTED TO DO.
I WANTED IT TO HAVE THAT 

00:22:18.252 --> 00:22:19.067
CONNECTION BUT I ALSO NEEDED A 
MORE PERSONAL CONNECTION WITH 

00:22:19.068 --> 00:22:23.760
THE MAIN CHARACTER AND I MOVED 
THAT MALE CHARACTER OVER AND 

00:22:23.761 --> 00:22:27.635
NISHA KIND OF BLOSSOMED, THE 
MAIN CHARACTER AND I KNEW 

00:22:29.684 --> 00:22:31.684
SOMEHOW SHE WAS VERY QUIET, VERY
SHY AND WOULD HAVE TROUBLE 

00:22:33.747 --> 00:22:35.612
TALKING WITH PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF 
HER FAMILY BUT SHE WOULD BE ABLE

00:22:35.613 --> 00:22:37.659
TO EXPRESS HERSELF IN A DIARY 

00:22:41.131 --> 00:22:43.366
AND FIND HER VOICE THAT WAY AND 
CREATING NISHA WRITING IN HER 

00:22:43.367 --> 00:22:47.054
DIARY HELPED ME FIGURE OUT KIND 
OF MY VOICE FOR THE BOOK AND HER

00:22:47.055 --> 00:22:50.522
VOICE AND HER FINDING HER VOICE 
SO ALL THOSE LAYERS.

00:22:51.742 --> 00:22:52.963
&gt;&gt; WHICH BRINGS US, I WAS 
THINKING ALSO ABOUT JUST THE 

00:22:52.964 --> 00:22:56.230
FORM, THE WAY YOU GUYS DECIDED 
TO TELL YOUR STORY BECAUSE 

00:22:57.245 --> 00:22:59.094
THAT'S A THING, RIGHT?
YOU'RE SITTING THERE AND YOU 

00:22:59.095 --> 00:23:01.141
COULD TELL THE SAME STORY IN SO 

00:23:06.302 --> 00:23:08.302
NOVEL, YOU'RE TELLING IT THROUGH

00:23:09.567 --> 00:23:12.033
A DIARY, SO YOU GUYS PLAYED WITH
TIME, SOMETIMES CHRONOLOGY, 

00:23:13.453 --> 00:23:15.453
SOMETIMES MAGICAL REALISM.

00:23:16.707 --> 00:23:19.188
HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR FORM?
DID THAT -- I HEAR NOW HOW VEERA

00:23:19.189 --> 00:23:21.426
DID IT BUT HOW ABOUT THE REST OF
YOU?

00:23:23.051 --> 00:23:25.301
DID YOU, WAS THAT CONSCIOUS?
DID YOU EXPERIMENT WITH OTHER 

00:23:25.302 --> 00:23:27.302
WAYS OF TELLING THIS STORY?

00:23:30.409 --> 00:23:32.409
OR DID IT FLOW PRETTY MUCH FROM 
THE BEGINNING?

00:23:33.724 --> 00:23:35.724
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME AGAIN.

00:23:37.745 --> 00:23:41.273
[ LAUGHTER ]
&gt;&gt; YOU'LL FORGIVE ME ONE DAY, 

00:23:41.274 --> 00:23:43.529
TIFFANY.
&gt;&gt; SO MONDAY'S NOT COMING IS 

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:45.556
TOLD IN A SERIES OF BEFORES AND 

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:54.814
AFTERS, SO IT'S BEFORE MONDAY'S 
DISAPPEARANCE AND AFTER AND I 

00:23:54.815 --> 00:23:58.863
DID THAT HONESTLY FOR A 
THREE-FOLD REASON, ONE, I REALLY

00:23:58.864 --> 00:24:01.935
WANTED EVERYONE TO GET TO KNOW 
MONDAY AND CLAUDIA.

00:24:03.762 --> 00:24:05.398
I WANTED THEM TO GET TO KNOW 
THEIR RELATIONSHIP.

00:24:05.399 --> 00:24:07.467
I WANTED THEM TO SEE IT BUILD 
AND SEE IT BLOSSOM AND SEE HOW 

00:24:07.468 --> 00:24:09.468
BEST FRIENDS COULD REALLY LOVE 

00:24:12.176 --> 00:24:14.410
EACH OTHER, AND, TWO, OR A 
SECOND REASON, IS I DIDN'T 

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:17.840
WANT -- SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE I 
WRITE THRILLERS, AND IF YOU 

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:21.358
NOTICE, A LOT OF THRILLERS 
THERE'S ALWAYS SORT OF LIKE A 

00:24:21.359 --> 00:24:23.797
DEAD GIRL IN THE BACKGROUND AND 
SHE'S NOT REALLY TALKED ABOUT 

00:24:23.798 --> 00:24:27.071
AND I DIDN'T WANT MONDAY TO BE 
JUST ANOTHER DEAD GIRL.

00:24:29.303 --> 00:24:30.322
I WANTED HER TO ACTUALLY LIKE 
REALLY THRIVE ON THE PAGE FOR 

00:24:30.323 --> 00:24:33.186
YOU TO GET TO KNOW HER.
SO WHENEVER THE OUTCOME OF THE 

00:24:33.187 --> 00:24:36.028
STORY IS, YOU'RE MORE AFFECTED 
BY IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE GIRL.

00:24:36.231 --> 00:24:38.489
IT'S NOT JUST LIKE A PHANTOM 
PERSON.

00:24:40.108 --> 00:24:43.169
THREE, I REALLY WANTED THIS 
STORY TO BE AN EXPERIENCE.

00:24:45.819 --> 00:24:47.039
SO I WANTED -- OF COURSE, IT 
SEEMS LIKE THE CHAPTERS ARE SORT

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.908
OF ALL OVER THE PLACE BUT THAT'S
EXACTLY HOW CLAUDIA WAS FEELING.

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:52.549
SHE WAS DISTURBED.
SHE WAS FRUSTRATED.

00:24:53.365 --> 00:24:55.020
SHE WAS CONFUSED.
SHE WAS DEALING WITH HER OWN 

00:24:55.021 --> 00:24:57.270
LEARNING DISABILITY.
SHE WAS DEALING WITH THE FACT 

00:24:57.271 --> 00:25:00.727
THAT SHE HAD A BEST FRIEND THAT 
WAS MISSING, AND FELT LIKE NO 

00:25:00.728 --> 00:25:03.372
ONE ELSE SEEMED TO ACKNOWLEDGE 
THAT.

00:25:05.205 --> 00:25:07.205
SO I WANTED HER FEELINGS TO 

00:25:08.454 --> 00:25:10.286
REALLY -- I WANTED THE READER'S 
FEELINGS TO PARALLEL CLAUDIA'S 

00:25:10.287 --> 00:25:12.553
FEELINGS.
SO THAT WAS SORT OF LIKE, IT WAS

00:25:12.554 --> 00:25:16.870
SORT OF A THREE-FOLD KIND OF, 
YOU KNOW, A MIXED STEW THERE.

00:25:16.871 --> 00:25:20.946
&gt;&gt; IT WAS CHALLENGING THOUGH.
MANIPULATING TIME THAT WAY, IT 

00:25:20.947 --> 00:25:22.947
WAS TRICKY.
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:25:25.065 --> 00:25:26.491
&gt;&gt; I MEAN, AND TO BE HONEST, I 
DIDN'T ORIGINALLY WRITE IT THAT 

00:25:26.492 --> 00:25:28.521
WAY.
I ACTUALLY WROTE IT IN 

00:25:29.738 --> 00:25:31.180
CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER AND OF 
COURSE LIKE MANY OF MY BOOKS I 

00:25:31.181 --> 00:25:35.647
COME UP WITH AN IDEA OUT OF 
NOWHERE AND I WOKE UP AT 2:00 IN

00:25:35.648 --> 00:25:39.523
THE MORNING AND I WAS LIKE OH, 
WE SHOULD DO IT THIS WAY AND 

00:25:39.524 --> 00:25:43.181
THAT'S LITERALLY WHAT I DID.
HONESTLY THE ONLY REASON I WAS 

00:25:43.182 --> 00:25:47.928
ABLE TO REMOTELY DO IT AND NOT 
DRIVE MYSELF CRAZY IS BECAUSE I 

00:25:47.929 --> 00:25:51.008
HAVE A FILM BACKGROUND SO I TAKE
EVERY CHAPTER AND CONSIDER IT 

00:25:51.009 --> 00:25:54.491
LIKE A SCENE SO I WAS ABLE TO 
REARRANGE EVERYTHING JUST LIKE 

00:25:54.492 --> 00:25:56.981
YOU'D DO IN THE EDIT ROOM.
THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY.

00:25:58.815 --> 00:26:00.849
WHEN PEOPLE ARE LIKE OH, TEACH 
ME HOW TO DO THIS, I WAS LIKE...

00:26:01.465 --> 00:26:04.744
&gt;&gt; GET A MEDIA DEGREE.
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:26:06.366 --> 00:26:07.599
THAT WAS ACTUALLY ONE OF MY 
QUESTIONS ALSO THAT I WANTED TO 

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:11.483
RANGE ON, WAS ALL OF YOU HAVE 
THESE COLORFUL, INCREDIBLE 

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:14.300
BACKGROUNDS, PROFESSIONAL 
BACKGROUNDS.

00:26:15.382 --> 00:26:17.382
LIKE, YOU'VE DONE OTHER STUFF, 
TV.

00:26:17.615 --> 00:26:19.615
BUT VEERA WAS AN EDITOR.
DAVID'S A PROFESSOR.

00:26:21.309 --> 00:26:23.181
SO, LIKE, I'M WONDERING, LIKE, 
HOW DO YOUR PAST EXPERIENCES, 

00:26:23.182 --> 00:26:27.442
HOW DID THEY HELP SHAPE HOW YOU 
ATTACKED MAYBE THE STRUCTURE OF 

00:26:27.443 --> 00:26:29.443
THE NOVEL AND SO ON?

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.583
SO I SEE CERTAINLY THE FILM PART
OF IT, AND HOW YOU WOULD TELL A 

00:26:33.584 --> 00:26:37.248
STORY LIKE THIS, AND TO SAY THAT
YOU WRITE A THRILLER IS THE 

00:26:38.476 --> 00:26:40.476
BIGGEST UNDERSTATEMENT.
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:26:42.789 --> 00:26:45.450
I READ THIS BOOK, LIKE, YOU 
KNOW, IN TERROR, BASICALLY.

00:26:46.058 --> 00:26:48.058
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO JUST BE WARNED.

00:26:49.752 --> 00:26:51.373
BUT I DEFINITELY SAW THAT, SO 
HOW DO YOUR PAST EXPERIENCES, 

00:26:51.374 --> 00:26:53.374
HOW DID IT HELP YOU TELL IT IN 

00:26:57.064 --> 00:26:59.064
TERMS OF HOW YOU PICKED THE FORM
FORM?

00:26:59.517 --> 00:27:01.517
&gt;&gt; I FEEL LIKE YOU JUST MADE THE
QUESTION SO MUCH HARDER.

00:27:02.993 --> 00:27:04.993
&gt;&gt; EVERYONE ON THIS END HAD 
ALREADY PREPARED ANSWERS.

00:27:06.867 --> 00:27:08.867
&gt;&gt; WHOEVER WANTS TO JUMP IN, YOU
CAN BE BRAVE.

00:27:09.334 --> 00:27:11.150
&gt;&gt; MY BACKGROUND IS KIND OF ALL 
OVER THE PLACE AND I FEEL LIKE 

00:27:11.151 --> 00:27:14.201
MY BOOK IS KIND OF ALL OVER THE 
PLACE.

00:27:14.608 --> 00:27:16.433
&gt;&gt; GOOD!
YAY!

00:27:16.434 --> 00:27:18.434
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:27:20.548 --> 00:27:22.580
&gt;&gt; I WISH I COULD WRITE, LIKE, A
BOOK THAT'S LINEAR, CHRONOLOGY, 

00:27:22.581 --> 00:27:26.065
START TO FINISH.
MY LIFE WOULD BE SO MUCH EASIER 

00:27:26.066 --> 00:27:30.367
BUT I START WRITING, AND I 
IMMEDIATELY GET BORED, AND I'VE 

00:27:30.368 --> 00:27:32.368
GOT TO THROW A WRENCH INTO 
THINGS.

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:35.046
I'VE GOT TO THROW ANOTHER WRENCH
INTO THINGS AND SUDDENLY I'M 

00:27:35.047 --> 00:27:39.152
JUGGLING MULTIPLE TIME LINES AND
I'M LIKE, WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:27:42.001 --> 00:27:44.039
AND FOR ME, IT WAS ALSO THAT -- 
I SORT OF HINTED UPON HOW I DO 

00:27:47.357 --> 00:27:49.791
ITERATIVE DRAFTING, SO MY DRAFTS
TEND TO LOOK HUGELY DIFFERENT 

00:27:49.792 --> 00:27:51.792
FROM PREVIOUS DRAFTS, AND SO 

00:27:54.471 --> 00:27:55.890
WHEN WE -- WHEN MY AGENT AND I 
SOLD THE BOOK, IT ACTUALLY WAS 

00:27:55.891 --> 00:27:59.378
MORE OF A FANTASY NOVEL.
IT CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN A 

00:27:59.379 --> 00:28:02.251
FANTASY WORLD AND THE REAL WORLD
AND IT WAS ALL BRAIDED TOGETHER 

00:28:02.252 --> 00:28:05.313
AND THEN THERE WERE DIFFERENT 
TIME LINES WITHIN THOSE, ALSO, 

00:28:08.385 --> 00:28:09.595
AND THEN I REALIZED THE FANTASY 
WORLD REALLY WASN'T WORKING THE 

00:28:09.596 --> 00:28:12.442
WAY I WANTED IT TO.
IT SORT OF TOOK THE WEIGHT OUT 

00:28:12.443 --> 00:28:16.713
OF THE STORY I WAS REALLY TRYING
TO TELL, SO I ENDED UP STRIPPING

00:28:16.714 --> 00:28:20.980
THAT ENTIRELY OUT OF THE BOOK, 
BUT I STILL NEEDED TO SOMEHOW BE

00:28:20.981 --> 00:28:26.074
ABLE TO ACCESS MEMORIES FROM THE
PAST, BECAUSE IN THE BOOK, LI 

00:28:26.075 --> 00:28:29.318
GETS THESE MEMORIES THAT BELONG 
TO OTHER PEOPLE THAT SHE 

00:28:31.566 --> 00:28:34.244
COULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN ANY OTHER 
WAY EXCEPT VIA MAGICAL MEANS, 

00:28:38.109 --> 00:28:40.109
AND SO THROUGH THAT, THE NEED TO

00:28:41.403 --> 00:28:43.403
FILL THAT KIND OF GUIDED MY TIME
LINE AND MY JUMPING AROUND.

00:28:45.095 --> 00:28:48.131
AND THEN I ENDED UP WITH, YOU 
KNOW, ALSO A BIG STEW.

00:28:48.537 --> 00:28:50.537
[ LAUGHTER ]
BIG CANS OF STEW UP HERE.

00:28:51.181 --> 00:28:52.604
&gt;&gt; WE LIKE FOOD.
&gt;&gt; IT'S FUN TO SEE HOW IT ALL 

00:28:52.605 --> 00:28:54.605
WORKS.
HOW ABOUT YOU GUYS?

00:28:56.671 --> 00:28:58.671
&gt;&gt; WELL, AS SOMEBODY WHO WAS AN 

00:28:59.792 --> 00:29:01.625
ENGLISH TEACHER FOR 14 YEARS AND
AFTER I GOT MY DOCTORATE I WAS 

00:29:01.626 --> 00:29:06.099
IN CHARGE OF AN ENGLISH LANGUAGE
ARTS PROGRAM AND ESL BILINGUAL 

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:09.163
PROGRAM IN AN ENTIRE SCHOOL 
DISTRICT AND NOW I'M TEACHING AT

00:29:09.164 --> 00:29:11.795
A UNIVERSITY.
WHEN THE IDEA CAME FOR ME TO 

00:29:11.796 --> 00:29:14.443
WRITE A BUNCH OF POEMS IN THIS 
KID'S VOICE I STARTED THINKING 

00:29:14.444 --> 00:29:18.350
AS A TEACHER:  WHAT DO TEACHERS 
NEED FROM A BOOK OF MIDDLE GRADE

00:29:18.351 --> 00:29:20.376
POETRY?
WHAT WOULD THEY LIKE TO HAVE?

00:29:20.568 --> 00:29:24.267
THEY'VE GOT TO TEACH ALL THESE 
DIFFERENT FORMS AND ALL THESE 

00:29:28.145 --> 00:29:29.803
DIFFERENT, LIKE, ELEMENTS OF 
PROSIDY SO MAYBE I CAN HAVE HIM 

00:29:29.804 --> 00:29:32.848
PLAYING AROUND WITH FORMAL 
POETRY BECAUSE SO MANY NOVELS 

00:29:32.849 --> 00:29:36.325
WILL BE WRITTEN IN FREE VERSE.
LET ME DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

00:29:36.725 --> 00:29:39.772
BEFORE I KNEW IT WOULD BE A 
NOVEL IN THE FIRST I HAD HIM 

00:29:39.773 --> 00:29:41.805
EXPERIMENTING WITH WRITING A SON
NET, WITH WRITING DIFFERENT 

00:29:43.636 --> 00:29:46.326
TYPES OF MORE METERED POETRY 
AND SO FORTH AND THE COLLECTION 

00:29:49.388 --> 00:29:51.388
WAS BROKEN UP INTO SECTIONS AND 
THE INITIAL CHRONOLOGICAL 

00:29:53.076 --> 00:29:54.890
SECTION THAT WAS MORE FREE VERSE
AND SECTIONS WHERE HE'S 

00:29:54.891 --> 00:29:56.891
EXPERIMENTING WITH DIFFERENT 
FORMS AND WRITING ABOUT 

00:29:57.125 --> 00:29:59.125
CELEBRATIONS AND PEOPLE IN HIS 
FAMILY AND SO FORTH.

00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:02.034
AND AS I WAS WRITING ALL THIS, 
IT WAS REALLY, REALLY A LOT OF 

00:30:02.035 --> 00:30:05.886
FUN BUT I HANDED OFF THE ROUGH 
DRAFT TO MY EDITOR AND HE'S 

00:30:07.307 --> 00:30:09.566
LIKE, WELL, THIS IS A GREAT 
EXERCISE IN, YOU KNOW, CREATING 

00:30:09.567 --> 00:30:14.277
A TEXTBOOK OR SOMETHING.
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:16.716
YOU'VE GOT TO START THINKING 
ABOUT THE TEACHERS, ABOUT THE 

00:30:16.717 --> 00:30:21.001
STUDENTS CLEARLY, AND THEN HE 
WAS THE ONE WHO SHOWED ME LOOK, 

00:30:21.002 --> 00:30:23.647
THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A NARRATIVE 
THREAD HERE, A STORY THAT WANTS 

00:30:23.648 --> 00:30:26.492
TO BE TOLD.
REARRANGE ALL THIS STUFF IN 

00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:29.543
CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER AND LET'S 
TAKE A LOOK AND SEE WHERE THE 

00:30:29.544 --> 00:30:32.820
GAPS ARE AND START FILLING THOSE
IN, AND HE STARTED MAKING 

00:30:34.657 --> 00:30:36.690
SUGGESTIONS FOR CHANGES TO SOME 
OF THE POEMS, OR THINGS NOR ME 

00:30:36.691 --> 00:30:40.575
TO THINK ABOUT, THAT WERE 
DISRUPTING WHATEVER FORM THE 

00:30:40.576 --> 00:30:44.455
POEM WAS BEING WRITTEN IN.
SO SOME OF THE POEMS ARE WEIRD 

00:30:44.456 --> 00:30:49.132
FUSIONS OF AN ORIGINAL FORMAL 
POEM AND THEN SOME, LIKE, 

00:30:49.742 --> 00:30:51.365
FREE-VERSE ELEMENTS.
I'M VERY HAPPY WITH THE FINAL 

00:30:51.366 --> 00:30:55.445
THING, BUT, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU 
GO INTO IT THINKING, AH, I WANT 

00:30:55.446 --> 00:30:58.496
TO MAKE SOMETHING THAT HAS 
UTILITY FOR TEACHERS, IT DOESN'T

00:30:58.497 --> 00:31:01.951
ALWAYS TURN OUT QUITE THE WAY 
STUDENTS ARE GOING TO BE HAPPY 

00:31:01.952 --> 00:31:03.779
WITH.
AND I THINK THIS IS -- WE'VE 

00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:06.823
FOUND A PLACE IN THE MIDDLE THAT
IS GOING TO BE EXCITING AND FUN 

00:31:10.105 --> 00:31:12.345
AND MEANINGFUL, FOR STUDENTS 
THAT WILL RESONATE THEM, BE A 

00:31:12.346 --> 00:31:16.113
MIRROR FOR LATINA KIDS, BE A 
WINDOW INTO THE CULTURE FOR 

00:31:17.938 --> 00:31:19.378
OTHERS BUT TEACHERS WILL BE LIKE
OH, THERE'S A SON NET IN THIS 

00:31:19.379 --> 00:31:21.379
BOOK.
THAT'S AWESOME.

00:31:22.879 --> 00:31:24.320
&gt;&gt; I THINK THE WARNING IS ALWAYS
THE MOMENT YOU START WRITING FOR

00:31:24.321 --> 00:31:28.390
THE ADULTS IF YOU'RE A 
CHILDREN'S AUTHOR OR YA AUTHOR, 

00:31:28.391 --> 00:31:31.452
THE MOMENT YOU START CONSIDERING
WHAT THE ADULTS ARE GOING TO 

00:31:31.453 --> 00:31:35.938
THINK, SAY, YOU'RE A GONER.
&gt;&gt; YEAH, YEAH.

00:31:37.567 --> 00:31:39.567
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE THE TED TORSO I'M 
REALLY FEELING LIKE WOWSA.

00:31:41.229 --> 00:31:44.327
&gt;&gt; WASN'T THAT GREAT AN EDITOR.
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:31:46.165 --> 00:31:48.415
&gt;&gt; THE TRUTH COMES OUT.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS THE ROUTE INTO 

00:31:49.016 --> 00:31:50.637
WRITING.
&gt;&gt; I WASN'T A GOOD LINE EDITOR.

00:31:50.638 --> 00:31:53.483
I'M NOT INCREDIBLY DETAIL 
ORIENTED THAT WAY.

00:31:54.728 --> 00:31:55.957
I'M MUCH BETTER AND I TEACH 
WRITING TOO SO I'VE ALWAYS BEEN 

00:31:55.958 --> 00:31:58.599
ON KIND OF DIFFERENT SIDES.
I'VE BEEN A WRITING STUDENT, A 

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:00.634
WRITING TEACHER, A WRITER, AN 

00:32:04.697 --> 00:32:06.137
EDITOR SO I SORT OF KNOW HOW ALL
THOSE DIFFERENT PLACES FEEL SO I

00:32:09.587 --> 00:32:11.587
THINK IT GIVES ME FLUIDITY OF 
WITH DRAFTS AND HAVING THAT 

00:32:12.256 --> 00:32:14.256
CONVERSATION WITH YOUR EDITOR.

00:32:16.149 --> 00:32:18.179
I REALLY NEVER ATTACH MYSELF TO 
WHATEVER DRAFT IT IS, AND I KNOW

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:20.416
THAT IT'S GOING TO CHANGE.
I WANT IT TO CHANGE.

00:32:22.847 --> 00:32:25.496
I WANT TO HEAR THAT OTHER INPUT.
I'M ACTUALLY A REALLY LINEAR 

00:32:25.497 --> 00:32:28.970
WRITER, SO I CAN GET A LITTLE 
CONSTRAINED.

00:32:31.204 --> 00:32:33.204
I ALMOST WISH I COULD JUMP 
AROUND HERE AND JUMP AROUND 

00:32:34.459 --> 00:32:36.692
THERE SO I OFTEN GIVE MYSELF 
SOME KIND OF LIMIT IN MY WRITING

00:32:36.693 --> 00:32:39.945
LIKE THE DIARY FORMAT OR A POINT
OF VIEW THAT I CAN KIND OF COME 

00:32:39.946 --> 00:32:45.038
UP AGAINST AS A PROBLEM, LIKE, 
HOW DO I TELL A WHOLE STORY IN A

00:32:45.039 --> 00:32:47.298
DIARY?
AND WILL PEOPLE BE OKAY WITH ME 

00:32:47.299 --> 00:32:50.972
TAKING THE LEAP, THE MAIN 
CHARACTER KIND OF MAYBE FILLING 

00:32:50.973 --> 00:32:55.461
OUT MORE OF A NARRATIVE IN THE 
DIARY THAT MAYBE A 12-YEAR-OLD 

00:32:55.462 --> 00:32:57.504
WOULD ACTUALLY WRITE IN THEIR 
DIARY?

00:33:00.552 --> 00:33:01.971
AND SO I DO -- THERE WERE TIMES 
WHERE I KNEW I WAS GOING TO MAKE

00:33:01.972 --> 00:33:06.039
THAT LEAP BUT THEN THERE WERE 
TIMES I REALLY HAD TO, JUST 

00:33:07.092 --> 00:33:08.925
THROUGH DRAFTS, LIKE, THAT'S TOO
MUCH.

00:33:08.926 --> 00:33:10.926
YOU'RE REALLY WRITING SOMETHING 
ELSE.

00:33:11.385 --> 00:33:13.385
YOU'RE NOT WRITING A DIARY ENTRY
ANYMORE.

00:33:14.413 --> 00:33:17.333
BUT I LIKE TO HAVE THOSE WALLS 
TO KIND OF HIT AGAINST, AND THEN

00:33:17.334 --> 00:33:19.520
MAKE CHOICES ABOUT THEM.

00:33:23.493 --> 00:33:25.493
&gt;&gt; I FEEL LIKE I GO BACK --
[ SIMULTANEOUS SPEAKERS ]

00:33:25.538 --> 00:33:27.538
LIKE, YOU CAN GIVE ME THE LINEAR
PARTS AND I'LL GIVE YOU MY 

00:33:28.368 --> 00:33:30.368
JUMPING-AROUND PARTS.
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:33:30.406 --> 00:33:32.406
&gt;&gt; AFTER THE PANEL, WE'LL DO 
THAT.

00:33:35.047 --> 00:33:38.580
[ LAUGHTER ]
&gt;&gt; I FEEL LIKE I GO BACK INTO MY

00:33:38.581 --> 00:33:42.470
TEACHING LIFE.
FOR MERCY I DID THAT.

00:33:44.102 --> 00:33:45.525
I FEEL LIKE PEOPLE ASK YOU, WHAT
DID YOU DO BEFORE YOU WERE A 

00:33:45.526 --> 00:33:48.587
WRITER AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
AND I FEEL LIKE EVERYTHING 

00:33:50.007 --> 00:33:52.007
YOU'VE DONE IN YOUR WHOLE LIFE 
MAKES YOU A WRITER.

00:33:52.868 --> 00:33:55.008
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU FEEL THAT 
WAY BUT I FEEL LIKE IT ALL COOKS

00:33:58.059 --> 00:34:00.726
INTO THE PERSON WHO CREATES.
ALL RIGHT, BECAUSE WE'RE HERE 

00:34:03.794 --> 00:34:05.216
CERTAINLY IN HONOR OF "WE NEED 
DIVERSE BOOKS," I WANT TO TALK 

00:34:05.217 --> 00:34:10.596
ABOUT HOW WE WRITE THE NUANCED 
STORIES OF OUR COMMUNITIES.

00:34:13.036 --> 00:34:15.036
AND IN PARTICULAR, I WANT TO 

00:34:16.351 --> 00:34:18.586
TALK ABOUT HOW WE TALK ABOUT THE
DIFFICULTIES FOR KIDS IN OUR 

00:34:23.068 --> 00:34:25.087
COMMUNITIES, AND ALSO BOTH THE 
HARDSHIPS, THE LESS FLATTERING 

00:34:25.088 --> 00:34:27.949
PARTS OF OUR COMMUNITIES.
LIKE, HOW IS IT THAT YOU 

00:34:30.184 --> 00:34:32.419
APPROACH THAT IN YOUR WORK?
AND I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A 

00:34:33.645 --> 00:34:35.674
BREAK, TIFFANY.
I COULD FEEL THE TERROR COMING 

00:34:35.675 --> 00:34:37.675
OFF THE WOMAN.
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:34:39.543 --> 00:34:41.776
IT'S COMING RIGHT THROUGH.
SO I'M GOING TO PUT EMILY ON THE

00:34:41.777 --> 00:34:45.251
SPOT THIS TIME.
YOU SEE, THEY FEEL SO BAD FOR 

00:34:45.252 --> 00:34:47.252
YOU.
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:34:48.974 --> 00:34:50.974
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S REALLY A MATTER 

00:34:52.044 --> 00:34:54.044
OF BEING HONEST.

00:34:56.962 --> 00:34:59.420
I THINK IT'S THAT I FEEL LIKE 
WHEN I -- I'VE CONSIDERED MYSELF

00:34:59.421 --> 00:35:02.894
A STORY TELLER FOR PRETTY MUCH 
MOST OF MY LIFE, AND WHEN YOU 

00:35:02.895 --> 00:35:07.972
FIRST START OUT, YOUR EARLY 
NOVELS, YOU'RE TRYING TO -- YOU 

00:35:07.973 --> 00:35:11.675
TRY TO WRITE THESE PERFECT 
CHARACTERS WHO ARE LIKE THE 

00:35:15.117 --> 00:35:16.335
DISNEY-FIED VERSION OF MAYBE 
YOURSELF OR SOME IMAGINING IN 

00:35:19.387 --> 00:35:21.387
YOUR HEAD OF, LIKE, THAT PERFECT
UNICORN HUMAN WHO DOES 

00:35:22.665 --> 00:35:23.885
EVERYTHING EXACTLY RIGHT AND 
THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY INTERESTING 

00:35:23.886 --> 00:35:27.622
TO READ, AND AS YOU DEVELOP AS A
WRITER, FOR ME IT WAS ABOUT 

00:35:29.659 --> 00:35:31.659
CHALLENGING MYSELF TO PUT THE 
FAULTS ON THE PAGE, TO FIND 

00:35:32.924 --> 00:35:35.167
THOSE FLAWS, TO EXAMINE THEM AND
SEE HOW THEY ACTUALLY MAKE US 

00:35:35.168 --> 00:35:40.052
MORE HUMAN AND MORE INTERESTING,
AND TO PUT MISTAKES ON THE PAGE,

00:35:40.053 --> 00:35:44.316
AND THEN KIND OF LIKE I WAS 
SAYING EARLIER ABOUT HOW IT TOOK

00:35:44.317 --> 00:35:49.411
ME SO LONG TO FIND THE CHARACTER
FOR THE ASTONISHING COLOR OF 

00:35:52.726 --> 00:35:54.793
AFTER, I HAD TO BE WILLING TO 
DELVE INTO THINGS THAT WERE 

00:35:56.411 --> 00:35:58.448
DIFFICULT TO TALK ABOUT AND 
THINK ABOUT.

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:02.104
AND THE UGLY PARTS OF MY 
EXPERIENCES GROWING UP, NOT JUST

00:36:05.194 --> 00:36:07.194
THE FUN THINGS, BUT, YOU KNOW, 
LIKE, DEALING WITH 

00:36:09.104 --> 00:36:11.143
MICROAGGRESSIONS, AND DEALING 
WITH NEVER FEELING LIKE ENOUGH, 

00:36:11.144 --> 00:36:15.012
NEVER FEELING ASIAN ENOUGH.
NEVER FEELING AMERICAN ENOUGH.

00:36:18.266 --> 00:36:20.266
AND I THINK IT JUST REALLY 
BECAME ABOUT CAPTURING THAT 

00:36:22.377 --> 00:36:24.377
TRUTH AS RESPECTFULLY AS 
POSSIBLE.

00:36:25.878 --> 00:36:28.130
AND ALSO DOING MY DUE DILIGENCE,
BECAUSE WE INEVITABLY ALL HOLD 

00:36:28.131 --> 00:36:33.029
OUR OWN BIASES, AND SO I 
INTERVIEWED A LOT OF PEOPLE TO 

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:36.078
WRITE THE ASTONISHING COLOR OF 
AFTER.

00:36:38.124 --> 00:36:39.961
I GENERALLY INTERVIEW A LOT OF 
PEOPLE FOR ANYTHING I WRITE TO 

00:36:39.962 --> 00:36:43.015
TRY TO UNDERSTAND THINGS FROM 
ALL DIFFERENT SIDES, TO TRY TO 

00:36:43.016 --> 00:36:46.536
UNDERSTAND WHERE MY BRAIN MIGHT 
BE FIXATED ON SOMETHING BECAUSE 

00:36:46.537 --> 00:36:49.794
OF HOW I WAS RAISED OR WHATEVER.
&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT'S REALLY WISE, 

00:36:49.795 --> 00:36:54.267
ESPECIALLY, AND I KNOW THIS IS 
THE INCREDIBLY THE ASTONISHING 

00:36:54.268 --> 00:36:56.315
COLOR OF AFTER IS A DIFFICULT 

00:37:00.197 --> 00:37:02.197
BEAU -- 
DEBUT NOVEL WHICH IS IS A 

00:37:03.864 --> 00:37:05.864
GLORIOUS ACHIEVEMENT BUT I VERY 
MUCH HEAR THAT NOTION OF 

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.024
HUMILITY WHEN WE APPROACH OUR 
WORK AND THAT WE CAN GET THINGS 

00:37:10.025 --> 00:37:15.103
WRONG OURSELVES.
ABOUT OUR OWN COMMUNITIES EVEN.

00:37:18.388 --> 00:37:20.388
SO IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE IT'S SUCH 
A STRUGGLE RIGHT NOW IN OUR 

00:37:21.658 --> 00:37:23.078
COMMUNITY AT LARGE IN 
PUBLISHING.

00:37:23.079 --> 00:37:25.107
WHO GETS TO WRITE WHAT.
BUT WE'RE ALL BEING HELD TO THAT

00:37:25.108 --> 00:37:27.585
STANDARD, EVEN WE ARE HOLDING 
OURSELVES TO IT.

00:37:30.227 --> 00:37:32.706
&gt;&gt; NO, I THINK IT WAS DANIEL 
JOSÉ WHOSE COMMENT I READ A 

00:37:33.916 --> 00:37:35.916
COUPLE YEARS AGO IN TALKING 
ABOUT DIVERSITY.

00:37:35.969 --> 00:37:38.191
HE GOES I LOOK FORWARD TO THE 
DAY WHEN WE DON'T HAVE TO USE 

00:37:38.192 --> 00:37:42.458
THE WORD DIVERSITY ANYMORE WHEN 
WORK JUST REFLECTS REALITY SO 

00:37:42.459 --> 00:37:46.741
WHEN I SET OUT TO WRITE ABOUT A 
MEXICAN AMERICAN BOY IN THE 

00:37:48.569 --> 00:37:50.569
VALLEY, IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT 

00:37:51.834 --> 00:37:53.834
TO ME TO BE HONEST AND REFLECT 
THE WORLD AS IT TRULY IS.

00:37:55.288 --> 00:37:56.519
OBVIOUSLY IT'S A FICTIONALIZED 
VERSION OF THINGS, AND AS THE 

00:38:00.385 --> 00:38:02.385
TITLE SUGGESTS THEY CALL ME GU
GUEBO.

00:38:03.649 --> 00:38:05.649
THAT MEANS A WHITE COATED LIGHT 

00:38:07.982 --> 00:38:09.982
SKINNED MEXICAN AMERICAN AND AT 

00:38:12.683 --> 00:38:14.510
THE POINT CORE OF THE BOOK GUERO
IS COMING TO NOTICE AS THE MOST 

00:38:14.511 --> 00:38:17.357
LIGHT SKINNED PERSON IN HIS 
FAMILY HE IS THE MOST PRIVILEGED

00:38:17.358 --> 00:38:21.030
OF THE FAMILY AND PUSHING BACK 
AGAINST THAT, THE WAY ANY 

00:38:23.074 --> 00:38:24.699
12-YEAR-OLD KID WOULD BECAUSE HE
ALSO FEELS PART OF A COMMUNITY, 

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:28.403
THAT'S A COMMUNITY OF COLOR SO 
EVEN THOUGH HE IS A WHITE LATINO

00:38:28.404 --> 00:38:30.404
HE BELONGS TO A COMMUNITY OF 

00:38:32.726 --> 00:38:34.726
COLOR SO HE'S IN THIS WEIRD 

00:38:36.016 --> 00:38:38.051
LIMINAL SPACE WHERE FOR EXAMPLE 
WHEN HIS SISTER TERESA WHO'S A 

00:38:38.052 --> 00:38:42.184
BASKETBALL PLAYER, HER TEAMS GET
TO GO AWAY AS PART OF THE 

00:38:47.469 --> 00:38:48.906
CHAMPIONS TO A FAR AWAY TOWN IN 
ANOTHER PART OF TEXAS, THAT'S 

00:38:51.952 --> 00:38:53.952
NOT AS BROWN AS THAT SPOT.
IT HAS MANY SPOTS THAT ARE 

00:38:54.392 --> 00:38:57.016
REDDER AND WHITER.
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:38:58.472 --> 00:39:00.472
THE FANS OF THE OPPOSING TEAM 
START WITH A CHANT THAT WAS 

00:39:02.173 --> 00:39:04.220
RIPPED FROM THE HEADLINES OF GO 
BACK BACK TO MEXICO, BUILD THAT 

00:39:04.221 --> 00:39:08.887
WALL SO SUDDENLY GUERO WHO IS 
OFTEN SINGLED OUT FOR BEING 

00:39:10.716 --> 00:39:12.716
LIGHT SKINNED AND RED HAIRED AND
COLORED EYES AND FRECKLES 

00:39:14.613 --> 00:39:16.613
SUDDENLY IS DEFINITELY PART OF 

00:39:17.892 --> 00:39:19.892
THIS SOLIDARITY THAT COMES FROM 
BEING ATTACKED AS TOO

00:39:21.556 --> 00:39:22.976
COMMUNITY^, AND AT THAT MOMENT 
EVEN THOUGH HE ISN'T STRICTLY 

00:39:22.977 --> 00:39:26.232
SPEAKING A CHILD OF COLOR, HE IS
A CHILD OF COLOR BECAUSE HE'S 

00:39:26.233 --> 00:39:29.087
PART OF A COMMUNITY OF COLOR AND

00:39:33.797 --> 00:39:36.438
IT'S THAT WEIRD NEPLANTE, THAT 
LIMB NALL SPACE IN BETWEEN WHERE

00:39:36.439 --> 00:39:39.292
YOUR IDENTITY IS NEITHER ONE NOR
THE OTHER.

00:39:40.504 --> 00:39:42.354
WHEN IT'S CONVENIENT FOR CERTAIN
PEOPLE, YOU CAN BE SEEN AS WHITE

00:39:45.842 --> 00:39:47.456
BUT THE MINUTE YOUR LATINO 
IDENTITY COMES TO THE FOREFRONT 

00:39:47.457 --> 00:39:50.723
YOU'RE NO LONGER WHITE.
I WANTED TO GRAPPLE WITH THAT, 

00:39:50.724 --> 00:39:54.197
TO SHOW THE COLORISM WITHIN HIS 
OWN COMMUNITY THE WAY HE'S BOTH 

00:39:54.198 --> 00:39:57.466
TREATED BETTER AND SOMETIMES 
HATED UPON FOR BEING 

00:39:59.502 --> 00:40:01.502
LIGHT-SKINNED, AND ALSO THE WAY 
HIS COMMUNITY IS HAVING TO 

00:40:02.179 --> 00:40:04.179
GRAPPLE WITH WHAT'S BEING PUSHED
ON THEM IN 2019.

00:40:06.258 --> 00:40:08.287
&gt;&gt; YEAH, I REALLY UNDERSTAND 
THAT IDEA OF BEING IN BETWEEN, 

00:40:08.288 --> 00:40:12.552
AND NOT REALLY KNOWING WHAT 
COMMUNITY YOU BELONG IN, AND 

00:40:12.553 --> 00:40:14.553
THAT'S SOMETHING I TRY TO BRING 

00:40:16.974 --> 00:40:18.620
TO ALL MY WORK, AND MY MOTHER 
WAS BORN HERE AND SHE'S JEWISH 

00:40:18.621 --> 00:40:23.081
AND MY FATHER WAS BORN IN INDIA 
AND HE'S HINDU AND SO I REALLY 

00:40:23.082 --> 00:40:25.082
STRUGGLED WITH THE NIGHT DIARY 

00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:31.257
BECAUSE I WAS WRITING A GIRL WHO
FIRST OF ALL WENT THROUGH THE 

00:40:31.258 --> 00:40:34.307
PARTITION IN 1947, AND I DID NOT
GO THROUGH THAT.

00:40:36.766 --> 00:40:37.983
SO OF COURSE, I TALKED TO A LOT 
OF PEOPLE AND I TALKED TO MY 

00:40:37.984 --> 00:40:41.047
FATHER, WHICH WAS AN INCREDIBLE 
OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO TALK 

00:40:46.587 --> 00:40:48.428
TO HIM ABOUT -- I WOULD SIT DOWN
AND SAY OKAY, DAD, EVERYTHING 

00:40:48.429 --> 00:40:50.885
YOU REMEMBER, ALL THE DETAILS 
YOU THINK AREN'T IMPORTANT TELL 

00:40:50.886 --> 00:40:53.728
ME, BUT THEN I TALKED TO A LOT 
OF FAMILY MEMBERS AND I LISTENED

00:40:57.027 --> 00:40:58.650
TO A LOT OF ORAL TESTIMONIES 
COLLECTED THIS BOOKS AND ONLINE,

00:40:58.651 --> 00:41:03.352
BUT I DID ASK MYSELF THE 
QUESTION:  AM I SUPPOSED TO -- 

00:41:03.353 --> 00:41:05.830
CAN I WRITE THIS?
IS THIS TOO MUCH OF A LEAP?

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:09.525
AND I COME FROM AN INTERFAITH 
FAMILY, BUT MY MAIN CHARACTER IS

00:41:09.526 --> 00:41:14.009
HINDU AND MUSLIM, BECAUSE I 
WANTED HER TO ASK A LOT OF 

00:41:16.682 --> 00:41:18.350
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY THOSE GROUPS
WERE IN CONFLICT DURING THAT 

00:41:18.351 --> 00:41:20.383
TIME.
SO I WANTED HER TO REALLY, WHEN 

00:41:20.384 --> 00:41:24.045
HER COUNTRY IS BEING TORN APART 
AND HER COMMUNITY IS BEING TORN 

00:41:24.046 --> 00:41:28.120
APART AND SHE HAS THESE MULTIPLE
IDENTITIES, WHERE DOES SHE 

00:41:28.321 --> 00:41:30.387
BELONG.
AND I CERTAINLY COULD RELATE TO 

00:41:30.388 --> 00:41:34.266
IT IN A VERY DEEPLY PERSONAL 
LEVEL BECAUSE MY WHOLE LIFE, I 

00:41:34.267 --> 00:41:37.710
FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN MANAGING 
MULTIPLE IDENTITIES, AND ASKING 

00:41:37.711 --> 00:41:40.367
THE QUESTION:  WHERE DO I 
BELONG?

00:41:41.623 --> 00:41:43.666
AND I'VE FOUND THAT IT REALLY 
HAS BECOME MY MUSE.

00:41:47.978 --> 00:41:49.397
IT'S REALLY INTERESTING, RICH, 
COMPLICATED PLACE TO LIVE KIND 

00:41:49.398 --> 00:41:51.398
OF IN BETWEEN.

00:41:53.663 --> 00:41:56.141
SO I PUT THAT SORT OF IN-BETWEEN
IN ALL OF MY CHARACTERS, AND ALL

00:41:56.142 --> 00:41:59.184
OF MY WORK, BUT IT'S GOING TO 
MANIFEST ITSELF DIFFERENTLY BUT 

00:41:59.185 --> 00:42:03.248
I DO LOOK FOR THAT PLACE.
WHERE CAN I TRULY, PERSONALLY, 

00:42:03.249 --> 00:42:06.327
DEEPLY CONNECT TO THIS STORY?
AND THEN IT'S GOING TO BLOSSOM 

00:42:06.328 --> 00:42:09.173
AND HAVE A LIFE OF ITS OWN AND 
THEN WHEN I AM GOING MORE 

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:12.641
OUTSIDE OF MYSELF, I SORT OF:  
OKAY, I'M WRITING MORE OUTSIDE 

00:42:12.642 --> 00:42:14.675
OF MYSELF NOW.
WHAT DO I NEED?

00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:17.522
WHAT KIND OF HELP DO I NEED?
WHAT KIND OF RESEARCH DO I NEED 

00:42:17.523 --> 00:42:19.974
TO DO?
HOW DO I SORT OF RESPECT THIS 

00:42:19.975 --> 00:42:23.025
DECISION IN THIS MOMENT IN THE 
BOOK?

00:42:23.843 --> 00:42:25.874
SO...
&gt;&gt; HI.

00:42:26.892 --> 00:42:28.892
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:42:33.483 --> 00:42:35.483
SO THE CHARACTER MONDAY, SHE -- 
SO THE BOOK, IF SOME OF YOU 

00:42:36.734 --> 00:42:39.031
DON'T KNOW, THE BOOK TAKES PLACE
HERE IN D.C., IN SOUTHEAST D.C.,

00:42:39.032 --> 00:42:42.093
SPECIFICALLY AND THE CHARACTER 
MONDAY LIVES IN A COMMUNITY 

00:42:45.241 --> 00:42:48.902
CALLED EDBOROUGH.
IF YOU READ CONTEXT CLUES AND 

00:42:48.903 --> 00:42:52.797
YOU'RE FROM HERE, EDBOROUGH IS 
ACTUALLY A COMMUNITY CALLED 

00:42:53.813 --> 00:42:56.501
BERRY FARMS.
BERRY FARMS IS OR WAS A 

00:42:58.770 --> 00:43:01.218
NOTORIOUS HOUSING PROJECT THAT 
WAS AT SOME POINT SATURATED WITH

00:43:01.219 --> 00:43:05.506
CRIME AND HAS BEEN RECENTLY SOLD
OFF TO DEVELOPERS TO BASICALLY 

00:43:05.507 --> 00:43:09.027
WIPE OUT THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY 
AND REBUILD SO GENTRIFICATION ON

00:43:09.028 --> 00:43:12.525
SPEED DIAL.
ON SPEED, I MEAN.

00:43:13.526 --> 00:43:15.526
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:43:16.601 --> 00:43:18.037
CAN'T REALLY CALL 
GENTRIFICATION, BUT YOU KIND OF 

00:43:18.038 --> 00:43:20.476
CAN.
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:43:22.121 --> 00:43:24.554
AND SO WHEN I WAS FIRST WRITING 
MONDAY'S NOT COMING, THERE WAS A

00:43:24.555 --> 00:43:28.849
LOT OF PROTESTS, A LOT OF 
EXODUS, A LOT OF PEOPLE TRYING 

00:43:28.850 --> 00:43:32.513
TO STOP THIS DEVELOPMENT FROM 
HAPPENING, STOPPING PEOPLE FROM 

00:43:32.514 --> 00:43:35.381
EVICTING AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY 
THAT'S BEEN THERE SINCE THE LAND

00:43:35.382 --> 00:43:39.447
WAS FIRST BOUGHT FOR FREED 
SLAVES SO THAT WAS LITERALLY THE

00:43:39.448 --> 00:43:41.607
ONLY THING IN THIS BOOK THAT I 
HAD CHANGED.

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:45.107
I ONLY CHANGED THAT.
I ONLY CHANGED THE NAME OF BERRY

00:43:45.108 --> 00:43:49.606
FARMS TO EDBOROUGH TO BASICALLY 
KIND OF NOT PUT ANYMORE 

00:43:52.058 --> 00:43:54.500
SPOTLIGHT IN ANY NEGATIVE SORT 
OF SPOTLIGHT ON TO THE 

00:43:54.501 --> 00:43:56.535
COMMUNITY.
AND I DIDN'T WANT TO PAINT WHAT 

00:43:56.536 --> 00:43:58.586
THEY WERE TRYING TO DO, AS WELL,
TOO.

00:44:00.428 --> 00:44:03.108
THAT'S SORT OF LIKE ONE OF THE 
HARDER PARTS ABOUT WRITING 

00:44:04.759 --> 00:44:06.759
ABOUT, QUOTE, UNQUOTE, ROUGH 
AREAS.

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:09.627
LIKE PROJECT HOUSES BECAUSE WHEN
PEOPLE HEAR THE PROJECT, THEY 

00:44:09.628 --> 00:44:13.718
IMMEDIATELY THINK LIKE THE 'HOOD
AND THAT'S NEVER BEEN MY INITIAL

00:44:13.719 --> 00:44:15.379
THOUGHTS.
WHEN I THINK OF HOUSING PROJECTS

00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:17.783
LIKE THAT, I THINK OF 
COMMUNITIES.

00:44:18.783 --> 00:44:20.412
I THINK OF FAMILIES.
SOME OF MY FAVORITE MEMORIES 

00:44:20.413 --> 00:44:25.309
HAVE BEEN AT MY AUNT'S HOUSE, SO
THERE IS A DELICATE BALANCE 

00:44:27.601 --> 00:44:29.601
BETWEEN PER PEP WAITING 
STEREO -- PERPETUATING 

00:44:30.888 --> 00:44:32.974
STEREOTYPES AND DIVING THROUGH 
THAT TRUTH AND SEEING THE COLOR 

00:44:32.975 --> 00:44:35.013
AND BEAUTY OF A COMMUNITY LIKE 
THAT.

00:44:37.252 --> 00:44:39.080
RIGHT NOW, THIS DAY, THERE ARE 
ONLY 3 FAMILIES LEFT IN BERRY 

00:44:42.972 --> 00:44:44.818
FARMS, OUT OF 444, ALMOST LIKE 
500 FAMILIES, WHICH IS INSANE.

00:44:44.819 --> 00:44:48.493
AND THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT I 
ALSO HAD TO GRAPPLE WITH IN 

00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:51.756
TERMS OF WHILE WRITING THIS BOOK
AS WELL, TOO, IS KNOWING THAT, 

00:44:51.757 --> 00:44:53.757
YOU KNOW, SOMEONE IS GOING TO 

00:44:56.653 --> 00:44:58.680
READ THIS BOOK NEXT YEAR AND NOT
KNOW WHAT THE HELL BERRY FARMS 

00:44:58.681 --> 00:45:02.003
EVEN WAS SO THERE WAS A VERY 
MUCH A DELICATE BALANCE OF THAT.

00:45:02.212 --> 00:45:06.072
THERE WAS A DELICATE BALANCE OF 
WE WEREN'T LOUD ENOUGH WHEN ALL 

00:45:06.073 --> 00:45:09.335
THIS WAS HAPPENING.
WE DIDN'T HAVE PEOPLE SAY, NO, 

00:45:09.336 --> 00:45:11.372
THIS IS WRONG.
YOU CANNOT EVICT ALL THESE 

00:45:12.588 --> 00:45:14.588
FAMILIES AND DISPLACE THEM.
LIKE, THIS IS WRONG.

00:45:15.667 --> 00:45:17.515
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE
AS A BLACK COMMUNITY, WE TEND TO

00:45:17.516 --> 00:45:20.795
BE VERY PRIVATE ABOUT THINGS.
WE DON'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE 

00:45:20.796 --> 00:45:24.050
UGLY.
WE LIKE TO BUILD IT IN OUR OWN 

00:45:24.051 --> 00:45:27.300
WAYS, SO THAT'S SOMETHING I ALSO
WANTED TO BRING TO THE FOREFRONT

00:45:27.301 --> 00:45:30.558
AS WELL, TOO, IS TALK ABOUT THE 
FACT THAT WHEN THINGS ARE GOING 

00:45:30.559 --> 00:45:33.425
BAD WE ARE DEALING WITH A LOT OF
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND WE 

00:45:35.449 --> 00:45:37.449
CAN'T JUST ERASE IT BY, YOU 
KNOW, PRAYING ABOUT IT.

00:45:38.291 --> 00:45:40.291
WE SHOULD TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT 
IT.

00:45:40.971 --> 00:45:42.802
WE SHOULD RAISE OUR VOICES ABOUT
IT SO I THINK THAT WAS SOMETHING

00:45:42.803 --> 00:45:46.493
THAT I -- AND I KNEW THAT I 
WOULD PROBABLY GET A LOT OF 

00:45:48.117 --> 00:45:50.974
FLACK FOR IT IN A WAY BECAUSE I 
WAS SORT OF EXPOSING A LITTLE OF

00:45:50.975 --> 00:45:54.023
THE DIRTY LAUNDRY AT THE SAME 
TIME BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS 

00:45:55.679 --> 00:45:57.323
IMPORTANT AND SO I'LL TAKE THE 
HITS IF I KNOW THAT IT'S GOING 

00:45:57.324 --> 00:46:02.603
TO HELP OUR COMMUNITY HEAL, AND 
SORT OF ERASE THE STEREOTYPES OF

00:46:02.604 --> 00:46:05.859
WHAT HOUSING PROJECTS COULD BE 
LIKE, AS WELL, TOO.

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:09.958
&gt;&gt; I FEEL THE WEIGHT OF THE 
DIRTY LAUNDRY THINGS TOO WHEN 

00:46:09.959 --> 00:46:14.254
I'M WRITING ABOUT MACHISMO OR 
FAMILY VIOLENCE, THOSE KINDS OF 

00:46:14.255 --> 00:46:17.320
THINGS.
I FEEL LIKE -- BUT I'M WITH 

00:46:18.562 --> 00:46:20.593
EMILY AND WITH ALL OF YOU.
JUST LIKE THE PUSH OF THE TRUTH 

00:46:20.594 --> 00:46:23.654
FEELS LIKE MORE URGENT TO ME.

00:46:28.741 --> 00:46:30.741
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT WRITING 

00:46:32.235 --> 00:46:34.235
REALLY HARD EMOTIONAL TRUTHS FOR
CHILDREN.

00:46:35.918 --> 00:46:37.918
BECAUSE THAT TAKES A LOT OF 
THINKING.

00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:40.227
IT TAKES A LOT OF THINKING, AND 
IT TAKES A LOT OF CONSIDERATION 

00:46:40.228 --> 00:46:43.885
OF WHO THE CHILDREN ARE, HOW OLD
THEY ARE, ALL OF THAT.

00:46:44.699 --> 00:46:46.699
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
HOW DO YOU APPROACH THAT?

00:46:47.344 --> 00:46:48.764
BECAUSE I MEAN THINK OF THE 
SUBJECTS THAT WE HAVE HERE, 

00:46:48.765 --> 00:46:50.765
RIGHT?

00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:54.860
WE HAVE ADULTS MURDERING EACH 
OTHER.

00:46:55.317 --> 00:46:58.409
WE HAVE A MOM'S SUICIDE.
WE HAVE THE LOSS OF A FRIEND.

00:46:59.235 --> 00:47:04.716
WE HAVE GRAPPLING WITH, LIKE, 
DEEP IDENTITY:  WHO AM I IF I 

00:47:04.717 --> 00:47:07.975
DON'T LOOK LIKE MY FAMILY?
WHO AM I?

00:47:09.807 --> 00:47:11.449
SO HOW DO WE WRITE THESE PAINFUL
THINGS?

00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:12.868
WHAT ARE THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS 
YOU ASK YOURSELF WHEN YOU'RE 

00:47:12.869 --> 00:47:14.915
GOING TO WRITE SOMETHING THAT'S 

00:47:18.978 --> 00:47:20.978
VIOLENT, THAT'S HARD, THAT'S 
TRUE?

00:47:23.183 --> 00:47:27.668
&gt;&gt; I TYPICALLY -- SO I'M KIND OF
KNOWN FOR GUT-PUNCHING PEOPLE 

00:47:27.669 --> 00:47:30.924
WITH MY STORIES, TO PUT IT VERY 
LIGHTLY.

00:47:32.771 --> 00:47:34.771
[ LAUGHTER ]
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:47:36.867 --> 00:47:38.526
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE I ALWAYS -- I FEEL 
THAT WE GROSSLY UNDERESTIMATE 

00:47:38.527 --> 00:47:42.213
WHAT KIDS CAN HANDLE AS FAR AS 
PAIN, AS FAR AS WHAT THEY'RE 

00:47:42.214 --> 00:47:45.276
ABLE TO ABSORB.
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, I 

00:47:45.277 --> 00:47:48.326
FEEL LIKE IT'S MORE URGENT FOR 
US TO DO THAT.

00:47:50.356 --> 00:47:52.437
WHEN I THINK OF WRITING STORIES,
I WANT TO WRITE RAW STORIES.

00:47:55.315 --> 00:47:57.315
I WANT TO WRITE STORIES THAT 
REALLY STICK WITH YOU.

00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:59.760
YOU ALWAYS REMEMBER THE FIRST 
TIME YOU GOT HIT.

00:47:59.797 --> 00:48:01.624
I MEAN, I DO.
SO I FEEL LIKE THAT'S SOMETHING 

00:48:01.625 --> 00:48:05.836
THAT YOU REMEMBER THAT STORY.
YOU DON'T WANT THAT STORY TO 

00:48:05.837 --> 00:48:09.142
REALLY LEAVE THE PERSON'S HEAD.
I WANT MY STORIES TO BE RAW.

00:48:11.192 --> 00:48:14.048
I WANT THE PLOT TWISTS TO BE 
FOREVER IN MY BOOKS SO THAT KIDS

00:48:14.049 --> 00:48:17.908
REMEMBER THOSE LESSONS SO IN A 
COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN KIDS ARE IN

00:48:17.909 --> 00:48:20.559
VOTING BOOTHS AND THEY HAVE TO 
VOTE ON A PROPOSITION THAT'S 

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:23.840
GOING TO ERASE AN ENTIRE 
COMMUNITY, I WANT THEM TO 

00:48:25.869 --> 00:48:27.087
REMEMBER MONDAY AND BERRY FARMS 
AND EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED IN 

00:48:27.088 --> 00:48:30.205
MONDAY'S NOT COMING SO I 
PERSONALLY FEEL LIKE IT'S NOT 

00:48:33.249 --> 00:48:34.268
THAT I DON'T CARE ABOUT HOW 
EMOTIONALLY TRIGGERING THE BOOK 

00:48:34.269 --> 00:48:38.760
COULD BE, BUT I ALSO FEEL LIKE 
THERE'S AN URGENCY TO FIX OTHER 

00:48:38.761 --> 00:48:41.606
THINGS THAT MATTER MORE THAN 
ANYTHING ELSE.

00:48:42.014 --> 00:48:46.898
[ APPLAUSE ]
&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?

00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:49.926
&gt;&gt; YEAH, TOTALLY.
I AGREE, I THINK IT'S REALLY 

00:48:49.927 --> 00:48:53.468
DANGEROUS TO START OFF GOING:  
OH, I NEED TO PROTECT THE KIDS, 

00:48:53.469 --> 00:48:55.945
BECAUSE THE KIDS ARE GRAPPLING 
WITH STUFF.

00:48:57.993 --> 00:48:59.014
I MEAN, I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS 
THAT AGE AND THE KINDS OF STUFF 

00:48:59.015 --> 00:49:01.873
I HAD TO GRAPPLE WITH AND I 
REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE FOR MY

00:49:01.874 --> 00:49:05.326
DAD TO ABANDON US AND THE 
DEVASTATION YOU FEEL AFTER THAT 

00:49:05.327 --> 00:49:08.580
SO I DELIBERATELY TRY TO TAP 
INTO THE THINGS.

00:49:10.237 --> 00:49:12.237
ESPECIALLY WHEN WRITING FOR 

00:49:13.721 --> 00:49:15.339
UPPER MIDDLE GRADE AND YA, IF 
WRITING THE BOOK, IF I DO NOT 

00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:18.797
BREAK DOWN WEEPING SEVERAL TIMES
WRITING THE BOOK, THEN I'M NOT 

00:49:18.798 --> 00:49:22.654
DOING MY JOB BECAUSE I NEED TO 
TAP INTO SOMETHING THAT'S SO RAW

00:49:22.655 --> 00:49:25.777
AND VIBRANT THAT I CAN PUT IT 
ACROSS.

00:49:27.210 --> 00:49:28.860
AND THEN YOU LAYER A LITTLE BIT 
OF PROTECTION FOR THE KIDS SO 

00:49:28.861 --> 00:49:33.119
THEY'RE NOT BEING SLAMMED WITH 
IT LIKE SO BRUTALLY BUT YOU WANT

00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:35.591
THAT EMOTION TO BE THERE BECAUSE
THEY CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE.

00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:38.889
THEY KNOW WHEN YOU'RE JUST 
WRITING SOMETHING SUPERFICIALLY 

00:49:38.890 --> 00:49:42.130
TO GET A PAYCHECK AND GET ON THE
BEST SELLER LIST OR WHEN YOU'RE 

00:49:42.131 --> 00:49:45.206
WRITING SOMETHING THAT IS 
MEANINGFUL AND YOU TRY AND 

00:49:48.251 --> 00:49:50.251
TRANSMIT YOUR OWN DEEPLY FELT 
TRAUMA, EMOTION, OR JOY OR 

00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:53.535
WHATEVER THE EMOTION HAPPENS TO 
BE, RIGHT, TO THEM.

00:49:57.430 --> 00:50:00.297
AND WHEN PEOPLE -- I REMEMBER 
ANNA MARIAN NO ADDING ME ON 

00:50:01.313 --> 00:50:02.530
TWITTER BECAUSE SHE WAS 
WRAPPING UP THE BOOK AND SHE 

00:50:02.531 --> 00:50:04.531
LOVED IT AND SHE READ THE BOOK 

00:50:07.024 --> 00:50:08.870
ABOUT THE BOY'S DOG, AND SHE WAS
LIKE WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS TO 

00:50:08.871 --> 00:50:10.871
ME?
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:50:11.777 --> 00:50:13.608
BUT BECAUSE EVERY CHILD 
EXPERIENCES THE DEATH OF A PET, 

00:50:13.609 --> 00:50:17.470
AND A LOT OF TIMES FOR KIDS, 
IT'S THE VERY FIRST TIME THAT 

00:50:17.471 --> 00:50:20.510
THEY HAVE TO GRAPPLE WITH THAT 
AND I REMEMBER MY DOG DYING WHEN

00:50:23.574 --> 00:50:25.574
I WAS 7, AND HOW I WAS JUST -- I

00:50:27.236 --> 00:50:28.667
WAS SO HURT AND SO, LIKE, YOU 
KNOW, YOU'RE BEING FACED WITH 

00:50:28.668 --> 00:50:31.963
THIS DARKNESS THAT EXISTS ALL 
AROUND YOU, AND YOU'RE NOT READY

00:50:31.964 --> 00:50:36.472
FOR IT BUT THE WORLD THRUSTS IT 
ON YOU, AND I THINK IT'S KIND OF

00:50:36.473 --> 00:50:40.761
LIKE INCUMBENT UPON US TO BE THE
PERSON THAT HOLDS THE KID'S HAND

00:50:40.762 --> 00:50:43.839
AND SAY LOOK, THERE'S DARKNESS.
YOU NEED TO SEE IT BUT I'M GOING

00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:46.479
TO WALK WITH YOU AND WE'RE GOING
TO LOOK AT IT TOGETHER SO THAT 

00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:48.717
YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT ALONE 
IN THIS.

00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:53.480
IF WE COULD PUT THAT ACROSS I 
THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.

00:50:55.779 --> 00:50:57.779
&gt;&gt; HOW ABOUT WITH YOURS, EMILY?
IT DEALS WITH A PARENTAL 

00:50:58.823 --> 00:51:00.823
SUICIDE, AND I'M THINKING ABOUT 
THE WORD TRIGGERS, I I'M 

00:51:03.034 --> 00:51:04.243
THINKING OF ALL OF THOSE THINGS
THINGS^.

00:51:04.244 --> 00:51:06.827
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING ABOUT 
WHEN YOU WERE WRITING THOSE 

00:51:07.839 --> 00:51:09.497
SCENES AND THAT REALITY?
WERE YOU THINKING ABOUT THE 

00:51:09.498 --> 00:51:11.339
READER?
WERE YOU COMPLETELY IMMERSED IN 

00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:13.615
STORY?
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

00:51:15.842 --> 00:51:17.842
&gt;&gt; IT'S TRICKY, BECAUSE I, WHEN 

00:51:18.957 --> 00:51:20.957
I SAT DOWN IN FRONT OF THE YET 

00:51:22.036 --> 00:51:24.956
AGAIN BLANK SCREEN, JANUARY 2, 
2015, LITERALLY REWRITING THE 

00:51:24.957 --> 00:51:28.885
BOOK FROM SCRATCH AGAIN, I 
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS SETTING 

00:51:28.886 --> 00:51:30.886
OUT TO WRITE.

00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:35.420
AND THE OPENING PAGES OF THE 
BOOK POURED OUT OF ME.

00:51:36.281 --> 00:51:39.144
I ALWAYS TALK ABOUT HOW IT WAS 
KIND OF LIKE A FUGUE STATE AND I

00:51:39.145 --> 00:51:42.868
THINK I'VE HAMMERED HOME THE 
POINT THAT I REWRITE THINGS OVER

00:51:42.869 --> 00:51:45.730
AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
THOSE OPENING PAGES ARE THE ONLY

00:51:45.731 --> 00:51:50.625
PAGES IN THE BOOK THAT HAVE BEEN
SO PRESERVED SINCE THAT FIRST 

00:51:50.626 --> 00:51:53.282
DRAFT AND IN THE OPENING, IT 

00:51:56.315 --> 00:51:58.315
STARTS WITH LI, YOU KNOW, SEEING
THAT HER MOTHER HAS DIED BY 

00:52:01.630 --> 00:52:03.161
SUICIDE, AND I HONESTLY DID NOT 
SET OUT TO WRITE A BOOK ABOUT 

00:52:03.162 --> 00:52:07.062
SUICIDE OR A BOOK ABOUT 
DEPRESSION, BUT I HAD LOST MY 

00:52:07.063 --> 00:52:10.120
AUNT TO SUICIDE THE YEAR BEFORE,
AND I COULDN'T STOP THINKING 

00:52:10.121 --> 00:52:12.151
ABOUT IT.
AND KIND OF GOING BACK TO WHAT 

00:52:12.152 --> 00:52:15.657
YOU WERE SAYING WITH, LIKE, KIDS
DEALING WITH GRIEF, THE FIRST 

00:52:15.658 --> 00:52:18.097
TIME I LOST SOMEONE, I WAS 8 
YEARS OLD.

00:52:20.346 --> 00:52:22.219
MY GRANDFATHER, MY PATERNAL 
GRANDFATHER PASSED AWAY 8 DAYS 

00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:25.500
BEFORE MY BIRTHDAY AND MY 
PARENTS DIDN'T TELL ME FOR A 

00:52:25.501 --> 00:52:28.347
WHOLE MONTH BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T 
WANT TO RUIN MY BIRTHDAY.

00:52:30.191 --> 00:52:31.616
AND THEN THEY ALSO SAID, BUT YOU
DON'T NEED GO UPSET WHEN THEY 

00:52:31.617 --> 00:52:33.664
FINALLY TOLD ME.
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:52:35.086 --> 00:52:37.086
THIS IS A PATTERN IN MY FAMILY.
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:52:42.062 --> 00:52:44.062
THEY DEAL WITH DEATH IN THIS 
REALLY WEIRD WAY.

00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:45.906
WHEN MY CHILDHOOD DOG PASSED 
AWAY WHICH WAS JUST A HANDFUL OF

00:52:45.907 --> 00:52:48.353
YEARS AGO, MY PARENTS ALSO, 

00:52:52.054 --> 00:52:53.497
LIKE, DIDN'T TELL ME UNTIL OUR, 
LIKE, NIGHTLY PHONE CALL BECAUSE

00:52:53.498 --> 00:52:56.772
I'M ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO 
CALLS MY PARENTS EVERY DAY SO AT

00:52:56.773 --> 00:52:58.773
NIGHT I CALL THEM AND THEY'RE 

00:53:01.699 --> 00:53:03.962
OH, LIKE, THIS -- I'M LIKE ONE 
OF THOSE CO-DEPENDENT ONLY 

00:53:06.052 --> 00:53:08.052
CHILDREN, WHO, LIKE -- ANYWAY, 
THAT'S ANOTHER STORY.

00:53:08.096 --> 00:53:10.096
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:53:11.334 --> 00:53:13.827
AND SO, LIKE, THEY DIDN'T TELL 
ME UNTIL NIGHTTIME THAT, LIKE, 

00:53:13.828 --> 00:53:17.082
THEY HAD TAKEN MY DOG TO BE PUT 
DOWN THAT MORNING.

00:53:18.707 --> 00:53:21.429
AND WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT MY 
AUNT DIED IT WAS AGAIN, LIKE, AT

00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:24.670
MIDNIGHT, I WAS LIKE OH, CRAP, I
GOTTA CALL MY PARENTS.

00:53:26.339 --> 00:53:28.339
THEY'RE GOING TO BE GOING TO BED
SOON AND MY DAD LET ME GO 

00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:31.248
THROUGH MY WHOLE RAMBLE OF ALL 
THE MUNDANE THINGS HAPPENING IN 

00:53:31.249 --> 00:53:34.089
MY LIFE BEFORE HE WAS LIKE:  
THERE'S SOME SAD NEWS.

00:53:35.095 --> 00:53:38.569
YOUR AUNT PASSED THIS MORNING.
AND I WAS LIKE WTF!

00:53:40.851 --> 00:53:42.851
LIKE, HOW WAS THIS FAMILY SO 
UNHEALTHY ABOUT GRIEF?

00:53:43.494 --> 00:53:45.322
AND THEN THEY DID THE WHOLE SONG
AND DANCE OF LIKE, YOU DON'T 

00:53:45.323 --> 00:53:47.804
NEED TO BURDEN YOURSELF.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:50.654
OF ALL MY EXTENDED FAMILY 
MEMBERS, SHE'S THE ONE THAT I 

00:53:50.655 --> 00:53:54.908
ACTUALLY FELT THE CLOSEST TO.
AND SO IT WAS THIS, FOR ME, WHEN

00:53:54.909 --> 00:54:00.236
I WAS WRITING, SORRY, THIS IS A 
LONG-WINDED ANSWER.

00:54:01.917 --> 00:54:03.529
WHEN I WAS WRITING IT WAS LIKE I
WAS TRYING TO GRAPPLE WITH A LOT

00:54:03.530 --> 00:54:06.392
OF THINGS.
I WAS TRYING TO GRAPPLE WITH ALL

00:54:06.393 --> 00:54:08.428
THESE THINGS THAT I'D SORT OF 
SHELFED.

00:54:10.471 --> 00:54:12.298
IT TOOK ME UNTIL I GOT TO 
COLLEGE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE 

00:54:12.299 --> 00:54:15.964
WAY I HAD GROANED UP WAS 
ABNORMAL.

00:54:17.793 --> 00:54:19.009
THAT THE WAY DEPRESSION TAKES UP
SO MUCH SPACE IN A HOUSE, THAT 

00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:21.654
THE THINGS THAT WERE MAY 
CONCERNS AS I WAS GROWING UP 

00:54:21.655 --> 00:54:25.213
WERE NOT THE CONCERNS OF MANY 
OTHER KIDS AROUND ME.

00:54:26.639 --> 00:54:28.480
AND SO WHEN I WAS WRITING THE 
BOOK, THE FIRST DRAFT WAS REALLY

00:54:28.481 --> 00:54:30.525
ME WRITING PURELY FOR MYSELF, 

00:54:34.592 --> 00:54:36.616
AND IT WAS AS I DELVED INTO -- 
IT TOOK ME UNTIL DRAFT 3 TO BE 

00:54:36.617 --> 00:54:39.507
LIKE OH, I GOTTA LOOK DEPRESSION
HEAD-ON.

00:54:40.728 --> 00:54:42.355
I'VE GOT TO TALK ABOUT SUICIDE.
I'VE GOT TO TALK ABOUT HOW IT 

00:54:42.356 --> 00:54:45.433
AFFECTS NOT JUST ONE PERSON, BUT
THE WHOLE FAMILY.

00:54:47.072 --> 00:54:49.094
AND THEN IT BECAME THIS THING 
WHERE I HAD TO CAREFULLY CARVE 

00:54:49.095 --> 00:54:52.550
AWAY AND SAY WHAT THINGS DO I 
WANT TO SHOW ON THE PAGE?

00:54:54.576 --> 00:54:56.576
WHAT THINGS DO I WANT TO PROTECT
READERS FROM?

00:54:57.046 --> 00:54:59.673
ESPECIALLY READERS WHO ARE 
FELLOW SUICIDE LOSS SURVIVORS.

00:54:59.878 --> 00:55:04.164
I'M FULLY AWARE THAT FOR SOME 
PEOPLE IT WILL BE TOO TRIGGERING

00:55:04.165 --> 00:55:08.422
OF A BOOK TO READ, AND OTHERS, 
MANY SUICIDE LOSS SURVIVORS HAVE

00:55:08.423 --> 00:55:11.468
REACHED OUT TO ME TO SAY THAT 
THEY REALLY NEEDED A BOOK LIKE 

00:55:11.469 --> 00:55:13.469
THAT AND SO I THINK IT'S -- IT 

00:55:16.358 --> 00:55:17.813
IS A REALLY TRICKY THING TO 
NAVIGATE, TO FIGURE OUT, LIKE, 

00:55:21.278 --> 00:55:23.719
WHAT KIND OF LANGUAGE MIGHT BE 
POETIC BUT IS ACTUALLY DAMAGING,

00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:27.388
AND WHAT KIND OF THINGS ARE 
ACTUALLY IMPORTANT TO EXPLORE TO

00:55:27.389 --> 00:55:31.076
ALLOW FOR THAT SAFE SPACE.
WHEN I WASN'T GIVEN THE CHANCE 

00:55:31.077 --> 00:55:33.077
TO GRIEVE FOR MY GRANDFATHER 

00:55:37.017 --> 00:55:39.295
WHEN I WAS 8, I FOUND MY SOLACE 
IN BOOKS LIKE I READ WHERE THE 

00:55:39.296 --> 00:55:42.735
REDFERN GROWS AND SOBBED MY EYES
OUT BECAUSE IT WAS A SAFE SPACE 

00:55:42.736 --> 00:55:46.194
TO GRIEVE OVER THE DEATH OF 
THESE WONDERFUL DOGS AND I 

00:55:48.838 --> 00:55:51.279
NEEDED TO HAVE THAT SPACE SO I 
HOPE THAT I CAN OFFER A SAFE 

00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:54.556
SPACE TO SOMEBODY WHO NEEDS 
SOMETHING FICTIONAL TO CRY ABOUT

00:55:54.557 --> 00:55:58.508
IN ORDER TO WORK OUT THEIR REAL
REAL-LIFE FEELINGS.

00:56:00.541 --> 00:56:02.541
&gt;&gt; AND, VEERA --

00:56:03.546 --> 00:56:05.546
[ APPLAUSE ]

00:56:08.704 --> 00:56:10.704
I'M THINKING, ALSO, VEERA, THAT 

00:56:12.992 --> 00:56:14.992
YOU PEELED BACK A WINDOW INTO 
ADULTS -- THE VIOLENCE THAT 

00:56:18.938 --> 00:56:20.969
ADULTS PERPETRATE ON EACH OTHER 
IN THE FULL SIGHT OF CHILDREN.

00:56:21.578 --> 00:56:25.625
&gt;&gt; YEAH, RIGHT.
THAT WAS VERY DIFFICULT, AND, 

00:56:28.923 --> 00:56:31.565
YOU KNOW, I WOULD HEAR STORIES 
AND LOOK AT PICTURES TAKEN OF 

00:56:31.566 --> 00:56:33.566
THE TIME.

00:56:36.948 --> 00:56:39.393
I MEAN, THERE WERE TRAINS THAT 
WERE INTERCEPTED GOING IN BOTH 

00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:44.440
DIRECTIONS WHERE THEY WOULD 

00:56:45.726 --> 00:56:46.944
BE -- TRAINS WOULD BE STOPPED BY
RIDERS AND EVERYBODY WOULD GET 

00:56:46.945 --> 00:56:51.443
OUT OR GET IN, AND THERE WOULD 
BE THIS HORRIBLE SIGHT, AND THEN

00:56:51.444 --> 00:56:53.497
THERE WOULD BE -- TRAINS WOULD 

00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:57.967
PULL UP IN STATIONS FILLED WITH 
CORPSES DURING THE PARTITION, SO

00:56:57.968 --> 00:57:01.826
IF YOU TALK TO ANYBODY WHO'S 
BEEN THROUGH THIS TIME, AND YOU 

00:57:01.827 --> 00:57:05.891
MENTION THE TRAINS, THAT'S -- 
EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT "THE 

00:57:06.514 --> 00:57:08.952
TRAINS" MEAN.
YOU JUST HAVE TO SAY "THE 

00:57:08.953 --> 00:57:10.970
TRAINS."
MY FATHER'S FAMILY GOT ON A 

00:57:12.610 --> 00:57:14.255
TRAIN AND MADE IT SAFELY OVER 
THE BORDER, BUT SO MANY PEOPLE 

00:57:14.256 --> 00:57:16.256
DID NOT.

00:57:18.965 --> 00:57:20.183
SO I HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW I 
WRITE SOMETHING FOR YOUNG PEOPLE

00:57:20.184 --> 00:57:22.229
TO SEE THE TRUTH OF THIS 
HISTORY.

00:57:24.262 --> 00:57:26.262
I MEAN, IT'S A LIVING HISTORY 
STILL.

00:57:26.931 --> 00:57:29.165
MY FATHER'S IN HIS 80s AND 
MOST PEOPLE -- AND HE WAS 9 WHEN

00:57:29.166 --> 00:57:32.209
HE WENT THROUGH THIS, SO MOST 
PEOPLE WHO WENT THROUGH THE 

00:57:34.034 --> 00:57:36.034
PARTITION ARE IN THEIR 80s AND 

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.531
90s, AND OLDER, AND THEN WE'RE 
NOT GOING TO HAVE THESE PEOPLE 

00:57:38.532 --> 00:57:41.214
ALIVE TO TELL THEIR STORIES 
ANYMORE SO I THINK PEOPLE OF MY 

00:57:41.215 --> 00:57:44.700
GENERATION FROM PARTITION 
SURVIVORS REALLY FEEL THIS 

00:57:45.113 --> 00:57:47.551
URGENCY.
I DEFINITELY FELT AN URGENCY TO 

00:57:47.552 --> 00:57:50.396
CAPTURE THIS HISTORY IN THE WAY 
THAT I COULD AND PEOPLE ARE 

00:57:51.832 --> 00:57:54.071
DOING IT IN DIFFERENT WAYS, JUST
TO MAKE SURE TO CAPTURE IT.

00:57:55.682 --> 00:57:57.682
BUT THE TRUTH OF THE HISTORY IS 

00:58:00.578 --> 00:58:02.578
SO BLOODY AND SO UNIMAGINABLE 

00:58:04.635 --> 00:58:07.490
THAT I WANTED TO HAVE SOME OF 
THAT TRUTH IN THE STORY, BUT I'M

00:58:12.790 --> 00:58:14.790
ALSO A PARENT, AND I FELT LIKE 
WHAT CAN KIDS HANDLE?

00:58:15.856 --> 00:58:17.856
AND I THINK THAT THEY CAN HANDLE

00:58:18.933 --> 00:58:20.364
A LOT, BUT I ALSO DIDN'T WANT TO
SORT OF INTERRUPT THE EXPERIENCE

00:58:20.365 --> 00:58:22.365
OF LEARNING ABOUT THIS HISTORY, 

00:58:25.431 --> 00:58:28.120
MAKING IT TOO TRAUMATIC, BECAUSE
THE RAW HISTORY IS -- YOU CAN'T 

00:58:28.121 --> 00:58:32.184
EVEN PROCESS IT.
AND I WOULD SIT WITH TEARS 

00:58:34.058 --> 00:58:36.296
STREAMING DOWN MY FACE LOOKING 
AT PICTURES, OR FEEL SICK 

00:58:37.907 --> 00:58:40.140
SOMETIMES, BUT THEN I WOULD JUST
TAKE THAT FEELING AND SEE:  HOW 

00:58:40.141 --> 00:58:43.612
CAN I KIND OF MATCH ALL THOSE 
THINGS:  THE TRUTH OF THE 

00:58:45.249 --> 00:58:47.249
CHARACTER, THE TRUTH OF THEIR 
STORY.

00:58:47.877 --> 00:58:49.519
PULLING IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT
STORIES THAT I RESEARCHED, AND 

00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:51.963
THERE WAS SOME PROTECTION.
I WAS PROTECTING THE YOUNG 

00:58:53.843 --> 00:58:57.093
READER AT CERTAIN TIMES.
&gt;&gt; AND I THINK YOURS IS A MIDDLE

00:58:57.094 --> 00:59:00.569
GRADE NOVEL AS OPPOSED TO YA.
I WRITE ACROSS THOSE AGE GROUPS 

00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:03.215
TOO, AND THERE ARE SLIGHTLY 
DIFFERENT CONSIDERATIONS FOR 

00:59:03.216 --> 00:59:05.860
EACH ONE.
I THINK SOMEONE AT 17 ISN'T 

00:59:07.711 --> 00:59:09.711
SOMEONE AT 11, RIGHT?
SO WE MODULATE.

00:59:12.167 --> 00:59:13.400
WE HAVE TO MODULATE THAT.
SO BECAUSE I HAVE CONSIDERATION 

00:59:13.401 --> 00:59:17.050
FOR YOU FOLKS I'M NOT GOING TO 
LEAVE YOU ON THIS SAD PLACE.

00:59:17.467 --> 00:59:19.467
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:22.510
SO THIS IS A JOYOUS DAY, 
FRIENDS, RIGHT?

00:59:24.423 --> 00:59:26.423
SO I THINK NOW WE TALK FUN 
THINGS.

00:59:28.696 --> 00:59:30.338
SO I AM JUST INTERESTED IN LIKE,
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT WHAT

00:59:30.339 --> 00:59:32.357
A CAREER THIS IS.
RIGHT?

00:59:33.388 --> 00:59:35.388
WHAT A JOURNEY!

00:59:40.714 --> 00:59:42.147
I HAD NO IDEA WHENTYTY -- WHEN I
DECIDED I WANTED TO BE A WRITER 

00:59:42.148 --> 00:59:44.793
OR TRY, I REALLY, REALLY HAD NO 
IDEA.

00:59:46.526 --> 00:59:48.559
SO I'M CURIOUS, WHAT HAS 
SURPRISED YOU ABOUT BEING AN 

00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:50.604
AUTHOR?
WHAT HAS DELIGHTED YOU?

00:59:54.885 --> 00:59:56.885
AND WHAT HAS BEEN MAYBE SHOCKING
IN NOT SUCH A GOOD WAY?

00:59:57.732 --> 00:59:59.761
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
THIS COULD BE A FREE-FOR-ALL.

00:59:59.966 --> 01:00:01.966
WE HAVE ACTIONS TO GRIND RIGHT 
HERE.

01:00:02.011 --> 01:00:04.011
NO.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

01:00:04.465 --> 01:00:06.465
WHAT HAS DELIGHTED YOU?
WHAT HAS SURPRISED YOU?

01:00:07.938 --> 01:00:09.969
&gt;&gt; SO WHEN I WAS GROWING UP I 
HONESTLY THOUGHT THAT WRITERS 

01:00:09.970 --> 01:00:13.033
WERE VERY SOLO CAREERS.
YOU'RE BY YOURSELF SO I'VE 

01:00:15.050 --> 01:00:16.065
ACTUALLY BEEN SO SURPRISED BY 
HOW MANY PEOPLE I'VE ACTUALLY 

01:00:16.066 --> 01:00:18.137
HAD TO TALK TO.
[ LAUGHTER ]

01:00:18.959 --> 01:00:20.959
LIKE THIS!

01:00:24.261 --> 01:00:25.703
FOR THOSE WHO REALLY KNOW ME I'M
ACTUALLY STILL, LIKE, QUITE SHY 

01:00:25.704 --> 01:00:28.360
SO THIS IS, LIKE, MY WORST 
NIGHTMARE.

01:00:28.971 --> 01:00:31.250
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT, LIKE, YEAH, I'M ACTUALLY 

01:00:31.251 --> 01:00:33.689
REALLY SURPRISED BUT ALSO 
DELIGHTED BY THE FACT THAT I DO 

01:00:37.156 --> 01:00:38.568
GET TO GO AND TOUR AROUND AND GO
DO SCHOOL VISITS AND TALKS TO 

01:00:38.569 --> 01:00:41.425
KIDS.
AND KIDS, THEY'LL KEEP YOU 

01:00:42.033 --> 01:00:44.033

&gt;&gt; YEAH!

01:00:44.095 --> 01:00:46.095
&gt;&gt; BLESS THEIR HEARTS.
[ LAUGHTER ]

01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:48.566
BUT I'VE ALWAYS BEEN LIKE, I'M 
SO SURPRISED BY HOW MANY PEOPLE 

01:00:48.567 --> 01:00:52.641
I GOT TO TALK TO, AND HOW MANY 
KIDS I GOT TO TALK TO.

01:00:54.291 --> 01:00:55.313
HOW MANY PRISONS I'VE GOTTEN A 
CHANCE TO VISIT AND THE YOUNG 

01:00:55.314 --> 01:00:58.592
MEN IN THERE AND TALKING TO THEM
AND HEARING THEIR STORIES.

01:01:00.405 --> 01:01:02.044
BECAUSE I HONESTLY, BY NOW, I 
REALLY THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE

01:01:02.045 --> 01:01:05.701
LIKE THE OLD WOMAN BY THE SEA.
I REALLY WAS JUST LIKE, I HAD MY

01:01:05.702 --> 01:01:07.702
SHACK READY.
[ LAUGHTER ]

01:01:09.361 --> 01:01:11.361
I DIDN'T THINK I HAD TO TALK TO 
ANYONE.

01:01:12.424 --> 01:01:14.094
I DEFINITELY DIDN'T THINK I'D 
HAVE TO BE ON TWITTER AND HAVE 

01:01:14.095 --> 01:01:17.568
TO INTERACT.
I DON'T REALLY DO PEOPLE.

01:01:17.975 --> 01:01:20.425
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO THAT HAS BEEN, LIKE, YOU KNOW

01:01:20.426 --> 01:01:23.460
A JOYOUS SURPRISE.

MS. DEBUT?

01:01:31.605 --> 01:01:33.634
TELL ME.
&gt;&gt; I'M PERPETUALLY SURPRISED ALL

01:01:33.635 --> 01:01:37.078
OVER AGAIN WHEN I'M SIGNING 
BOOKS AND AN ASIAN-AMERICAN 

01:01:39.124 --> 01:01:40.956
READER COMES UP TO ME AND SAYS: 
I DIDN'T REALIZE WE COULD DO 

01:01:40.957 --> 01:01:45.004
THIS, AND SAYS THAT, LIKE, 
YOU'RE THE FIRST ASIAN AUTHOR 

01:01:45.005 --> 01:01:47.005
I'VE EVER MET.

01:01:50.303 --> 01:01:52.710
AND EVERY SINGLE TIME I'M LIKE 
BOWLED OVER BY THAT, AND LIKE I 

01:01:55.977 --> 01:01:58.969
DID A SCHOOL VISIT AT MY OWN 
MIDDLE SCHOOL A FEW MONTHS AGO 

01:01:58.970 --> 01:02:02.244
AND THERE WAS THIS ONE 
ASIAN-AMERICAN GIRL WHO CAME UP 

01:02:02.245 --> 01:02:05.676
TO ME AND WAS IN TEARS.
I'M LIKE, ARE YOU OKAY?

01:02:06.290 --> 01:02:09.145
WHAT'S GOING ON?
AND SHE WAS LIKE:  YOU'RE, LIKE,

01:02:09.146 --> 01:02:12.307
A WRITER!
YOU'RE, LIKE, THE REAL DEAL.

01:02:12.498 --> 01:02:16.166
I WAS LIKE, WHOA!
THIS IS LIKE A LOT, YEAH.

01:02:18.595 --> 01:02:20.627
AND THAT'S BEEN LIKE REALLY 
AMAZING AND ALSO REALLY 

01:02:21.864 --> 01:02:23.864
DEPRESSING.
[ LAUGHTER ]

01:02:24.564 --> 01:02:25.766
&gt;&gt; YEAH, AND THAT'S TRUE.
THAT'S AN INTERESTING THING THAT

01:02:25.767 --> 01:02:29.849
THERE ARE SURPRISES THAT ARE 
BOTH REALLY JOYOUS AND REALLY 

01:02:29.850 --> 01:02:33.105
SAD.
I WAS SAD TO FIND OUT HOW FEW 

01:02:33.106 --> 01:02:37.167
BOOKS WERE WRITTEN BY OR ABOUT 
PEOPLE OF COLOR, AND I MEAN 

01:02:40.231 --> 01:02:42.290
WE'RE IMPROVING EVERY YEAR, BUT 
THAT'S A REALLY SAD REALITY WHEN

01:02:42.291 --> 01:02:44.291
YOU LOOK OUT AT OUR COUNTRY AND 

01:02:47.163 --> 01:02:49.240
SEE WHO'S HERE, AND THE VIBRANCY
OF THE COUNTRY.

01:02:51.878 --> 01:02:53.878
&gt;&gt; I CO-SIGN EVERYTHING TIFFANY 
AND EMILY JUST SAID.

01:02:54.723 --> 01:02:56.142
THE OTHER THING THAT REALLY 
SURPRISES ME THOUGH THAT I GUESS

01:02:56.143 --> 01:03:00.641
I WASN'T REALLY PREPARED FOR IS 
HOW INCREDIBLY REWARDING AND 

01:03:00.642 --> 01:03:02.642
EDIFYING IT WOULD BE TO BE PART 

01:03:05.147 --> 01:03:07.147
OF A COMMUNITY OF WRITERS, THAT 

01:03:09.048 --> 01:03:11.685
THE LATINX CAUCUS, THE LARGER 
COMMUNITY OF WRITERS OF COLOR, 

01:03:11.686 --> 01:03:16.369
THEY WELCOME YOU WITH OPEN ARMS.
THEY MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE JUST 

01:03:16.370 --> 01:03:20.033
ANOTHER SIBLING AND PART OF THIS
REALLY, REALLY BIG FAMILY, AND 

01:03:25.519 --> 01:03:27.857
THEY'RE PEOPLE YOU CAN CO- CAN 
COMMISERATE ABOUT THESE REALLY 

01:03:27.858 --> 01:03:31.324
THINGS AND TO HAVE THAT NETWORK 
AND HAVE EACH OTHER'S BACKS AND 

01:03:31.325 --> 01:03:34.794
TO GO INTO, BE ON A PANEL OR 
WHATEVER AND SEE ONE OF YOUR 

01:03:34.795 --> 01:03:38.480
FRIENDS IN THE AUDIENCE AND KNOW
THERE'S THAT SOLIDARITY.

01:03:39.904 --> 01:03:42.748
IT'S SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL.
&gt;&gt; I FOUND THAT JUST BEING 

01:03:44.170 --> 01:03:45.581
WELCOMED IN SO MANY WRITING 
COMMUNITIES, AND PARTICULARLY 

01:03:45.582 --> 01:03:49.247
WITH THIS BOOK IN THE SOUTH 
ASIAN WRITING COMMUNITY, I THINK

01:03:49.248 --> 01:03:52.097
THAT THAT HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY 

01:03:55.182 --> 01:03:57.674
JOYOUS FOR ME, AND IN SOME WAYS 
HEALING, BECAUSE I WASN'T SURE 

01:04:00.927 --> 01:04:02.927
IF I WAS, LIKE, ALLOWED, BEING 
HALF INDIAN.

01:04:06.833 --> 01:04:08.858
AND SO THAT HALFNESS HAS BEEN 
HARD FOR ME TO FIGURE OUT, AND 

01:04:08.859 --> 01:04:14.621
THEN I'VE JUST BEEN SO WELCOMED 
AND VALIDATED AND I JUST FEEL 

01:04:14.622 --> 01:04:19.298
LIKE IT'S OKAY TO BE ME, AND SO 
THAT HAS BEEN REALLY SURPRISING 

01:04:19.299 --> 01:04:21.554
AND WONDERFUL.

01:04:24.615 --> 01:04:26.258
&gt;&gt; I'VE ENJOYED THE HONOR OF 
JUST BEING WITH PEOPLE WHO LIVE 

01:04:26.259 --> 01:04:29.311
IN THEIR IMAGINATION.

01:04:33.036 --> 01:04:35.288
THERE'S A BEAUTIFUL GIFT IN THAT
THAT, AND WORKING WITH ADULTS 

01:04:35.289 --> 01:04:37.924
WHO STILL LIVE IN THE WORLD OF 

01:04:41.603 --> 01:04:42.828
PRETEND AND WHAT-IF, AND WHO CAN
STILL REMEMBER SO CLEARLY WHAT 

01:04:42.829 --> 01:04:45.296
IT IS TO BE A CHILD.
I LOVE THAT.

01:04:47.726 --> 01:04:49.351
AND I'M GETTING READY TO WRAP UP
AND WHAT I WANT TO SAY TO ALL OF

01:04:49.352 --> 01:04:53.033

IT HAS BEEN SUCH AN HONOR TO BE 

01:04:53.034 --> 01:04:56.091

AND DAVID AND VEERA, AND I JUST 

01:05:00.391 --> 01:05:04.280
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT ELSE YOU 
HAVE INSIDE OF YOU.

READY?

ASK THEM NOW.

[ LAUGHTER ]

01:06:04.024 --> 01:06:05.256

BECAUSE THIS BOOK TAKES PLACE 

01:06:05.257 --> 01:06:08.902
HERE IN D.C., WHICH IS VERY MUCH
MY SECOND HOME AND SO I WAS 

01:06:10.726 --> 01:06:12.726
EXCITED TO BRING A LOT OF D.C. 
SUBCULTURE TO THE PAGE.

01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:16.415
LIKE I WAS TALKING TO, LIKE, I 
WAS TALKING ABOUT GO-GO MUSIC

YOU REMEMBER THE BENITA JACKS 

01:09:02.359 --> 01:09:03.986
CASE.
THAT WAS VERY MUCH SOMETHING 

01:09:03.987 --> 01:09:06.233
THAT HAPPENED HERE.

01:09:09.936 --> 01:09:11.936
ONLY A DECADE AGO, SO THE 

01:09:13.188 --> 01:09:15.188
ENDINGS ARE SORT OF ALREADY -- I
ALREADY HAVE THEM.

01:09:15.217 --> 01:09:17.051
WHEN PEOPLE ARE LIKE, HOW DO YOU
COME UP WITH THESE CRAZY BOOKS?

01:09:17.052 --> 01:09:19.297
I'M LIKE ACTUALLY, HERE'S THE 
ARTICLE.

01:09:19.895 --> 01:09:22.636
[ LAUGHTER ]
I'M NOT MAKING UP ANYTHING.

01:09:24.065 --> 01:09:25.695
SO I GUESS THAT'S WHERE I SORT 
OF COME TO THE CONCLUSIONS OF 

01:09:25.696 --> 01:09:29.170
LIKE THE ENDINGS OF BOOKS IS 
LIKE USING THE REAL CASES, AND 

01:09:29.171 --> 01:09:33.653
TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE 
SENSE OF THE TRAUMA, AND MAKE 

01:09:33.654 --> 01:09:37.581
SENSE OF THE TRAGEDY, BY LAYING 
OUT AS MUCH CAUSES AND EFFECTS 

01:09:37.582 --> 01:09:40.230
OF HOW THINGS HAPPENED.
BECAUSE I WANT YOU GUYS 

01:09:42.279 --> 01:09:44.719
PARTICULARLY TO REALIZE, LIKE, 
EVERYTHING, YOU KNOW -- NO ONE 

01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:47.408
IS BORN BAD.
EVERYONE IS GROWN AND DEVELOPED 

01:09:47.409 --> 01:09:50.038
OUT OF SOMETHING, AND I WANT YOU
TO SEE ALL THOSE ELEMENTS.

01:09:51.908 --> 01:09:53.551
I WANT YOU TO SEE HOW 
GENTRIFICATION, HOW THE CRACK 

01:09:53.552 --> 01:09:57.420
EPIDEMIC, HOW POVERTY, HOW 
EVERYTHING ACTUALLY AFFECTS HOW 

01:09:57.421 --> 01:10:03.117
SOMEONE GROWS AND THEIR CHOICES 
THAT THEY EVENTUALLY MAKE.

01:10:04.132 --> 01:10:07.831
[ APPLAUSE ]
&gt;&gt; VERY GOOD.

01:10:09.046 --> 01:10:11.898
&gt;&gt; ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?
&gt;&gt; THERE'S ONE, FAR IN THE BACK.

01:10:12.107 --> 01:10:15.413
&gt;&gt; IN THE MIDDLE?
&gt;&gt; BY THE CAMERA.

01:10:16.632 --> 01:10:18.632
&gt;&gt; OH, YES.

01:10:20.514 --> 01:10:22.817
PICK THE MIC UP?
&gt;&gt; MY QUESTION IS DIRECTED 

01:10:23.415 --> 01:10:25.415
TOWARDS TIFFANY.

01:10:27.568 --> 01:10:30.213
IS THERE A SPECIFIC REASON WHY 
YOU CHOSE TO TALK ABOUT MONDAY 

01:10:30.214 --> 01:10:35.777
BEING A CHILD WHO WAS BEING 
ABUSED BY HER FAMILY?

01:10:36.805 --> 01:10:38.414
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT ACTUALLY 
HAPPENED TO THE GIRLS IN THE 

01:10:38.415 --> 01:10:42.764
INSPIRED STORY SO THAT WAS THE 
REAL REASON WHY I CHOSE TO TALK 

01:10:42.765 --> 01:10:46.077
ABOUT THAT TRAUMA, AND TALK 
ABOUT WHERE THAT TRAUMA WAS 

01:10:48.793 --> 01:10:50.793
ROOTED FROM, AS WELL, TOO.

01:10:52.264 --> 01:10:55.123
&gt;&gt; ONE MORE?
&gt;&gt; THERE'S SOME GIRLS WAY IN THE

01:10:55.124 --> 01:10:58.777
BACK BY THE CAMERA.
&gt;&gt; WAY IN THE BACK IN THE WHITE.

01:10:59.190 --> 01:11:03.061
&gt;&gt; I ACTUALLY EVENTUALLY WILL 
NEED GLASSES.

01:11:05.719 --> 01:11:07.719
THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS.

01:11:10.806 --> 01:11:12.806
&gt;&gt; HI.

01:11:15.967 --> 01:11:18.402
I WAS WONDERING, FOR MISS EMILY,
HOW DID YOUR FAMILY REACT TO YOU

01:11:18.403 --> 01:11:22.720
TALKING ABOUT THE TRAUMA THAT 
YOU WENT THROUGH WHEN YOU WERE 

01:11:22.721 --> 01:11:25.557
YOUNGER IN THE BOOK?
HOW DID THEY REACT TO YOUR 

01:11:27.401 --> 01:11:30.650
BOOKS, IN GENERAL?
&gt;&gt; MY PARENTS HAVEN'T FINISHED 

01:11:30.651 --> 01:11:32.651
READING IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]

01:11:34.757 --> 01:11:36.757
&gt;&gt; THAT IS HILARIOUS.
[ LAUGHTER ]

01:11:39.049 --> 01:11:41.732
&gt;&gt; BUT I DID SIT DOWN WITH THEM 
WHEN WE SOLD THE BOOK, TO BE 

01:11:41.733 --> 01:11:45.194
LIKE THIS, IS COMING OUT.
YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

01:11:49.661 --> 01:11:51.970
I SORT OF FEEL LIKE MY FAMILY IS
MAYBE A LITTLE -- I'M LIKE, ARE 

01:11:51.971 --> 01:11:53.971
THEY WATCHING THIS?
[ LAUGHTER ]

01:11:56.276 --> 01:11:57.707
YEAH, WE ARE LIVE STREAMING.
I THINK MY FAMILY IS PROBABLY A 

01:11:57.708 --> 01:12:01.791
LITTLE UNPREPARED FOR HOW 
HONESTY LIKE TO BE IN MY WORK.

01:12:01.992 --> 01:12:06.277
LIKE, ONE TIME I WROTE A SHORT 
STORY ABOUT SOMEONE WITH BAD 

01:12:06.278 --> 01:12:09.143
BREATH AND MY MOM WAS LIKE, 
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO THINK YOU 

01:12:09.144 --> 01:12:11.836
HAVE BAD BREATH.
&gt;&gt; IF SHE ONLY KNEW THAT THAT'S 

01:12:11.837 --> 01:12:15.519
THE SMALLEST PROBLEM.
&gt;&gt; SO WHAT I DID, I DID FEEL I 

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:19.804
WANTED TO BE RESPECTFUL SO I DID
REACH OUT TO MY COUSINS AND I 

01:12:19.805 --> 01:12:23.305
DID REACH OUT TO MY PARENTS, AND
SAY:  THIS IS SOMETHING I'M 

01:12:24.728 --> 01:12:27.587
WRITING ABOUT.
AND I KNOW THAT YOU FEEL VERY 

01:12:27.588 --> 01:12:31.118
TRAPPED BY THE STIGMA, AND YOU 
DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT 

01:12:31.119 --> 01:12:33.764
THERE'S DEPRESSION IN OUR 
FAMILY, AND YOU DON'T WANT 

01:12:37.689 --> 01:12:39.926
PEOPLE TO SEE US IN THAT LIGHT 
THAT YOU CAST UPON THIS ENTIRE 

01:12:39.927 --> 01:12:42.550
TOPIC.
AND I WANT TO BE ABLE TO TALK 

01:12:42.551 --> 01:12:45.652
ABOUT IT.
AND SO IT STARTED WITH THIS LIKE

01:12:45.653 --> 01:12:48.957
GROWING UP, MY PARENTS WERE 
ALWAYS LIKE, DON'T LET PEOPLE 

01:12:48.958 --> 01:12:51.409
KNOW THAT THERE'S DEPRESSION IN 
YOUR FAMILY BECAUSE THEY'LL LOOK

01:12:54.646 --> 01:12:56.646
AT YOU DIFFERENTLY, AND I ALWAYS
REALLY PUSHED AGAINST THAT.

01:12:57.744 --> 01:12:59.364
I ALWAYS FELT LIKE IT WAS 
SOMETHING THAT WE NEEDED TO -- 

01:12:59.365 --> 01:13:02.489
LIKE, DEPRESSION, ANY MENTAL 
ILLNESS, IT'S A HEALTH PROBLEM.

01:13:02.881 --> 01:13:06.087
LIKE, SOMEBODY WHO HAS DIABETES 
NEEDS INSULIN.

01:13:07.947 --> 01:13:10.381
MAYBE SOMEONE WHO HAS DEPRESSION
NEEDS MORE SEROTONIN SO WE NEED 

01:13:10.382 --> 01:13:13.632
TO TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS THE 
SAME WAY WE CAN TALK ABOUT OTHER

01:13:13.633 --> 01:13:17.361
HEALTH ISSUES SO THAT THE STIGMA
DOESN'T CAUSE PEOPLE TO DO MORE 

01:13:17.362 --> 01:13:21.350
DAMAGE TO THEMSELVES, TO FEEL 
LIKE THEY HAVE TO HIDE, AND THEY

01:13:21.351 --> 01:13:27.063
CAN'T LIVE OUT THERE FREELY, AND
SO I'VE ALWAYS BEEN MORE VOCAL 

01:13:27.064 --> 01:13:30.927
THAN MY FAMILY WANTED ME TO BE 
ABOUT IT, AND THEN WHEN I WROTE 

01:13:30.928 --> 01:13:34.175
THIS BOOK, I HAD TO SORT OF SIT 
MY PARENTS DOWN AND BE LIKE:  

01:13:34.176 --> 01:13:36.606
HOW MUCH ARE YOU WILLING TO LET 
ME TALK ABOUT?

01:13:37.639 --> 01:13:39.863
AND THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE 
AMAZING GIFTS OF THIS JOURNEY, 

01:13:39.864 --> 01:13:45.808
IS THAT MY PARENTS HAVE STARTED 
TO OPEN UP MORE ABOUT IT.

01:13:46.428 --> 01:13:48.428
YEAH.

01:13:49.710 --> 01:13:51.333
AND MY MOM HAS SAID TO ME, TOO, 
THAT ONE DAY, I ALSO WANT TO 

01:13:51.334 --> 01:13:53.334
WRITE ABOUT OUR FAMILY.
IT'S A GOAL.

01:13:55.018 --> 01:13:57.018
MY MOM IS ALSO A WRITER.
[ APPLAUSE ]

01:13:58.312 --> 01:14:01.150
&gt;&gt; WONDERFUL.
&gt;&gt; SO THAT'S BEEN -- MY MOM IS A

01:14:01.151 --> 01:14:05.022
CREATIVE NON-FICTION WRITER SO 
FEEL LIKE THROUGH HER LENS IT 

01:14:05.023 --> 01:14:07.901
WOULD BE REALLY ESPECIALLY 
IMPORTANT.

01:14:09.764 --> 01:14:11.419
AND SO, YEAH, I MEAN, IT'S A 
GREAT QUESTION.

01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:12.828
IT'S COMPLICATED.
I'LL REPORT BACK TO YOU WHEN 

01:14:12.829 --> 01:14:17.120
THEY ACTUALLY FINISH THE BOOK.
&gt;&gt; WE WANT THE TRANSCRIPT OF THE

01:14:17.121 --> 01:14:19.121

01:14:20.797 --> 01:14:23.032
ALL RIGHT, IF WE CAN GIVE THESE 
WONDERFUL AUTHORS A HAND.

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

01:14:42.935 --> 01:14:45.602
WHEN WE SELECTED THE TOPIC, 
READ, DISCOVER, GROW, WE HAD NO 

01:14:45.603 --> 01:14:48.240
IDEA HOW MUCH WE WOULD GROW IN 
SUCH A SHORT TIME.

01:14:49.465 --> 01:14:51.465
THANK YOU AGAIN, ALL OF YOU.

NUANCED STORIES OF OUR

COMMUNITIES, THE CHALLENGES OF 
PERPETUATING STEREOTYPES, OR 

01:15:08.518 --> 01:15:11.775
TELLING THE TRUTH.
I JUST COULD GO ON FOREVER AND I

01:15:11.776 --> 01:15:16.006
THINK THIS HAS JUST BEEN SUCH A 
WONDERFUL SYMPOSIUM, AND I 

01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:19.314
REALLY WANT TO THANK THE LIBRARY
OF CONGRESS FOR PARTNERING WITH 

01:15:22.601 --> 01:15:24.601

QUO HAS NEVER BEEN AN EASY FEAT.

01:45:14.879 --> 01:45:16.776
GIVEN AWAY OVER 14,000 BOOKS TO 
SCHOOLS NATIONWIDE, AND WE'VE 

01:45:16.777 --> 01:45:21.860

WITH CROWN BOOKS PENGUIN RANDOM 

01:45:21.861 --> 01:45:25.188
HOUSE, OUR MIDDLE GRADE 
ANTHOLOGY, FLYING LESSONS AND 

01:45:25.189 --> 01:45:29.459
OTHER STORIES, AND OUR YA 
ANTHOLOGY, FRESH INC., AND THIS 

01:45:29.460 --> 01:45:33.336
YEAR, BECAUSE EVERY TIME I GO TO
A SCHOOL VISIT, THEY SAY:  

01:45:34.777 --> 01:45:37.024
WHERE ARE MORE ANTHOLOGIES?
THIS YEAR, WE HAVE ANOTHER 

01:45:39.256 --> 01:45:40.898
MIDDLE-GRADE ANTHOLOGY CALLED 
THE HERO NEXT DOOR COMING OUT, 

01:45:40.899 --> 01:45:43.561
AND I'M SO EXCITED.

01:45:46.452 --> 01:45:47.872
STATISTIC:  WE HAD CONTESTS FOR 
NEW UNPUBLISHED WRITERS IN ALL 

01:45:47.873 --> 01:45:50.336

CONTEST WINNERS HAVE GONE ON TO 

01:45:55.884 --> 01:45:59.579
GET THEIR OWN BOOK DEAL.
[ APPLAUSE ]

01:46:01.632 --> 01:46:03.304
YEAH, SO I FEEL LIKE WE'VE 
TRULY ACCOMPLISHED SO MUCH IN 

01:46:03.305 --> 01:46:05.305
THESE PAST 5 YEARS.

01:46:08.597 --> 01:46:10.279
NOW, WHEN WE STARTED, "WE NEED 
DIVERSE BOOKS," OUR GOAL WAS A 

01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:12.678
WORLD IN WHICH CHILDREN CAN SEE 
THEMSELVES IN THE PAGES OF A 

01:46:12.679 --> 01:46:15.154
BOOK, RIGHT?
WHAT WE NOW KNOW IS THAT IT'S 

01:46:15.155 --> 01:46:18.876
NOT JUST ABOUT SEEING OURSELVES.
IT'S THAT IT'S JUST AS IMPORTANT

01:46:18.877 --> 01:46:21.727
FOR EVERYONE TO SEE THEMSELVES, 

01:46:25.183 --> 01:46:27.672
EVERYONE HAS TO SEE THEMSELVES 
BEING TOLD IN THE PAGES OF A 

01:46:27.673 --> 01:46:29.790
BOOK.
WE HAVE TO READ THE STORIES OF 

01:46:29.791 --> 01:46:33.437
EVERYONE.
WE HAVE TO FIGHT STEREOTYPES AND

01:46:33.438 --> 01:46:37.514
BAD REPRESENTATION, AND SEEK TO 
EMPOWER AND ENRICH OUR 

01:46:38.736 --> 01:46:40.736
CHILDREN'S LIVES BY TEACHING 
THEM TO BE EMPATHETIC.

01:46:41.594 --> 01:46:44.238
NOW, CHILDREN DON'T HAVE THE 
CAPACITY -- I MEAN, CHILDREN, 

01:46:44.239 --> 01:46:46.954
WAIT I SAID THAT WRONG.
CHILDREN HAVE THE CAPACITY FOR 

01:46:46.955 --> 01:46:50.397
GREAT EMPATHY, BUT THEY'RE NOT 
BORN EMPATHETIC.

01:46:52.019 --> 01:46:54.019
THEY MUST LEARN IT THROUGH 
EDUCATION AND REAL-LIFE 

01:46:56.547 --> 01:46:57.791
EXPERIENCES, AND BOOKS ARE A 
REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THAT 

01:46:57.792 --> 01:47:01.668
LEARNING EXPERIENCE.
WE NEED TO GIVE OUR KIDS BOOKS 

01:47:01.669 --> 01:47:06.199
THAT ACCURATELY REFLECT THE 
WORLD THAT THEY LIVE IN, SO THAT

01:47:09.279 --> 01:47:11.309
THEY CAN READ WIDELY AND 
DIVERSELY AND MEET NEW PEOPLE, 

01:47:11.310 --> 01:47:13.952
NEW WORLDS, AND NEW FRIENDS 
THROUGH THE PAGES OF A BOOK, 

01:47:13.953 --> 01:47:17.632
BECAUSE THEY CAN THEN BECOME THE
FUTURE THAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR.

01:47:18.463 --> 01:47:22.323
WHICH IS WHY THIS AWARD CEREMONY
IS JUST SO VERY SPECIAL.

01:47:23.993 --> 01:47:25.212
WE CELEBRATE THE VERY BEST OF 
THE BOOKS THAT WE NEED TO SEE 

01:47:28.472 --> 01:47:31.114
THE MOST NOW, AND I HAVE TO SAY,
IT'S BEEN AMAZING TO SEE IT 

01:47:31.115 --> 01:47:33.400
GROW.
OUR FIRST YEAR OF THE WALTER 

01:47:33.401 --> 01:47:37.897
AWARDS, WE RECEIVED ONLY 50 
SUBMISSIONS FOR CONSIDERATION 

01:47:37.898 --> 01:47:41.589

THIS YEAR, THAT NUMBER HAS 

01:47:44.216 --> 01:47:45.484
JUMPED TO 244 SUBMISSIONS.
[ APPLAUSE ]

01:47:45.485 --> 01:47:47.917
YEAH.
OUR JUDGES HAD THEIR WORK CUT 

01:47:47.918 --> 01:47:50.330
OUT FOR THEM!
THIS IS A CHANGE THAT WE'VE BEEN

01:47:50.331 --> 01:47:55.304
HOPING TO SEE.
AND NOW WNDB HAS A NEW EXECUTIVE

01:47:55.305 --> 01:48:00.392
DIRECTOR, WITH OVER 20 YEARS OF

ORGANIZATION THAT WE ALL SUPPORT

ENSURE THAT EVERY CHILD IN 
AMERICA CAN SEE THEMSELVES IN A 

01:48:39.917 --> 01:48:41.383

YESTERDAY AND TODAY I'VE BEEN 

01:48:41.384 --> 01:48:43.384

CHANGE CHILDREN'S LIVES.
I COME TO THIS WORK WITH A 

01:48:55.356 --> 01:48:57.403
BACKGROUND IN YOUTH DEVELOPMENT.
OVER THE YEARS I HAVE WITNESSED 

01:48:57.404 --> 01:49:00.695
THE EMOTION A YOUNG CHILD OR A 
TEENAGER EXPRESSES WHEN THEY 

01:49:00.696 --> 01:49:03.365
CONNECT WITH A BOOK.
SOMETIMES THEY CRY.

01:49:04.396 --> 01:49:06.443
SOMETIMES THEY LAUGH.
BUT THEY ALWAYS HAD SOMETHING TO

01:49:06.444 --> 01:49:08.444
THINK ABOUT.
AND A WAY TO UNDERSTAND 

01:49:09.717 --> 01:49:11.717
THEMSELVES AND THE WORLD AROUND 
THEM.

01:49:13.210 --> 01:49:15.037
THE AUTHORS WE CELEBRATE TODAY 
ARE MASTERING THE ART OF 

01:49:15.038 --> 01:49:16.655
STORYTELLING.
THEY ARE SIGNALING TO CHILDREN 

01:49:16.656 --> 01:49:20.767
AND TEENS ACROSS THE COUNTRY:  I

01:49:23.233 --> 01:49:24.461

01:55:49.288 --> 01:55:53.775

] ]   WALTER DEAN, I GOT TO KNOW
HIM AS A COLLEAGUE ON THE 

01:56:26.096 --> 01:56:27.736
ADVISORY BOARD OF THE SOCIETY OF
CHILDREN'S BOOK WRITERS AND 

01:56:27.737 --> 01:56:29.966
ILLUSTRATORS.
I CONSIDERED HIM A MENTOR NOT 

01:56:29.967 --> 01:56:33.440
ONLY ABOUT WRITING, BUT ABOUT 
THE WORLD AND LIFE AND 

01:56:35.084 --> 01:56:38.156
ESPECIALLY LIFE AS A PERSON OF 
COLOR.

01:56:40.243 --> 01:56:41.887
ABOUT 10 OR 12 YEARS AGO WE HAD 
A CONVERSATION THAT LED DIRECTLY

01:56:41.888 --> 01:56:45.971
TO ME STANDING HERE TODAY.
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT DIVERSITY 

01:56:45.972 --> 01:56:49.903
IN THE CHILDREN'S BOOK WORLD 
LONG BEFORE WNDB WAS EVEN A 

01:56:52.750 --> 01:56:55.040
TWINKLE IN ELLEN'S EYE, AND I 
WAS FLAILING, I WAS FLINGING 

01:56:55.041 --> 01:56:57.471
IDEAS AROUND, WANTING 
DESPERATELY TO DO SOMETHING 

01:56:59.342 --> 01:57:00.569
BEYOND MY OWN WRITING, SOMETHING
TO HELP CHANGE THE INDUSTRY, BUT

01:57:03.832 --> 01:57:06.706
I HAD NO CLUE HOW TO START.
WALTER DEAN, WALTER DEAN CAN!

01:57:07.100 --> 01:57:11.800
NO, WALTER DEAN, WALTER DEAN!
HE LISTENED SYMPATHETICALLY 

01:57:13.646 --> 01:57:15.084
WHILE I RAMBLED ON AND ON.
I WANTED TO PROVIDE SCHOLARSHIPS

01:57:15.085 --> 01:57:18.742
TO THE NYU OR THE COLUMBIA 
PUBLICING PROGRAMS BUT HOW WOULD

01:57:18.743 --> 01:57:20.988
I EVER RAISE ENOUGH MONEY FOR 
THAT?

01:57:21.805 --> 01:57:22.830
I WANTED PUBLISHING 
PROFESSIONALS TO GO INTO HIGH 

01:57:22.831 --> 01:57:25.691
SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES 
AND TALK TO YOUNG PEOPLE NOT 

01:57:25.692 --> 01:57:28.554
ABOUT WRITING BUT ABOUT CAREERS 
IN THE BOOK INDUSTRY:  EDITING, 

01:57:28.555 --> 01:57:32.259
MARKETING, SALES, PUBLICITY T I 
WANTED TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO 

01:57:32.260 --> 01:57:34.904
GET MORE PEOPLE OF COLOR AND 
OTHER DIVERSE IDENTITIES INTO 

01:57:34.905 --> 01:57:39.637
THE INTERNSHIP PIPELINE.
THAT'S IT, WALTER DEAN SAID TO 

01:57:39.638 --> 01:57:41.685
ME.
THAT'S THE BEST IDEA.

01:57:43.973 --> 01:57:46.027
THOSE OF YOU WHO KNEW WALTER 
DEAN WILL RECALL HIS 

01:57:47.006 --> 01:57:48.827
PRONOUNCEMENTS WERE AKIN TO 
HEARING SOMETHING IN THE VOICE 

01:57:48.828 --> 01:57:52.237
OF GOD SO FORTH I WENT.
HE WASN'T ACTUALLY PERFECT.

01:57:53.680 --> 01:57:55.680
WE HAD SO MANY ARGUMENTS ABOUT 
RAP MUSIC, I CAN'T TELL YOU.

01:57:57.209 --> 01:57:59.209
BUT FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS, I 
TALKED ABOUT INTERNSHIPS TO 

01:58:00.236 --> 01:58:02.236
ANYONE WHO WOULD STAND STILL 
LONG ENOUGH.

01:58:03.758 --> 01:58:05.774
AND THEN ONE FATEFUL DAY IN 
2014, ELLEN ASKED ME IF I WOULD 

01:58:09.074 --> 01:58:11.536
LIKE TO WORK WITH WNDB, AND I 
SAID:  YEAH, BUT I'VE GOT A 

01:58:11.748 --> 01:58:13.790
CONDITION.
I WANT TO WORK ON INTERNSHIPS.

01:58:14.193 --> 01:58:16.675
SHE SAID, OH, FINE.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN 

01:58:17.895 --> 01:58:19.895
INTERNSHIP PROGRAM.

01:58:21.382 --> 01:58:23.816
SIGN ME UP!
I HAVE BEEN HONORARY CHAIR OF 

01:58:23.817 --> 01:58:26.928

01:58:27.146 --> 01:58:29.570
THIS MR. THE FIFTH YEAR OF THE 
PROGRAM.

01:58:31.626 --> 01:58:33.626
OUR FIRST WNDB INTERNS RECEIVED 

01:58:35.031 --> 01:58:37.031
THEIR GRANTS IN 2015, WHICH HAVE
GIVEN 

01:58:38.445 --> 01:58:40.276
OUT 33 GRANTS BUT 22 OF THE 
INTERNSHIP GRANTEES NOW HAVE 

01:58:40.277 --> 01:58:44.315

THAT'S MORE THAN JUST A DROP IN 
THE BUCKET, RIGHT?

01:58:54.781 --> 01:58:55.809
THAT'S AT LEAST A RIPPLE AND 
BECAUSE OF MY INVOLVEMENT WITH

WITH THE INVITATION TO HOST THE 

01:59:02.308 --> 01:59:05.801
CEREMONY TODAY.
I'M NOT GOING TO STAND HERE AND 

01:59:05.802 --> 01:59:08.855
SAY WE DID IT, WALTER!
AND I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK HE'S 

01:59:08.856 --> 01:59:10.856
UP THERE.

01:59:13.997 --> 01:59:15.432
I THINK HE'S OUT THERE.

HE'S ALSO AN ACCOMPLISHED FINE 
ARTIST WHO HAS LECTURED AND 

01:59:45.196 --> 01:59:47.254
EXHIBITED INTERNATIONALLY.
HIS PRACTICE CAN BE DIVIDED INTO

01:59:47.255 --> 01:59:52.161
TWO CATEGORIES:  INTERVENTIONS 
IN HISTORICAL NARRATIVES AND 

01:59:52.162 --> 01:59:55.671

HE MAKES HIS OWN CLOTHES.

A FEW CENTURIES AGO, SOMEONE 
LIKE CHRIS WOULD HAVE MAYBE BEEN

02:00:22.148 --> 02:00:27.276

[ LAUGHTER ]

02:00:50.494 --> 02:00:52.494
IT'S SO GOOD TO HEAR SO MANY 
SWEET THINGS SAID ABOUT MAY 

02:00:52.537 --> 02:00:54.537
FATHER, RIGHT?
IT'S REALLY NICE.

02:00:54.980 --> 02:00:56.405
IT'S ALMOST ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU 
FORGET SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS 

02:00:56.406 --> 02:01:00.536
ABOUT HIM.
[ LAUGHTER ]

02:01:03.820 --> 02:01:06.693
I'LL TELL YOU A LITTLE STORY.
IT'S ABOUT 5.5 YEARS A I GO, 

02:01:06.694 --> 02:01:08.694
MAYBE 6.

02:01:11.394 --> 02:01:13.411
I WAS INVITED TO GO TO PAPUA, 
NEW GUINEA, WHICH IS JUST 

02:01:14.692 --> 02:01:16.692
FOREVER AWAY.
IT'S LIKE 9 PLANE RIDES.

02:01:17.979 --> 02:01:20.856
YOU HAVE TO GO TO AUSTRALIA, 
THEN YOU HAVE TO GO TO PORT 

02:01:24.729 --> 02:01:26.729
MOORESBY WHICH IS A LITTLE JENKY
TOWN BUT IT'S THE CAPITAL, 

02:01:27.170 --> 02:01:30.133
WHATEVER.
FROM THERE I FLEW TO ANOTHER 

02:01:30.134 --> 02:01:33.817
TOWN CALLED ALATAU AND FROM 
THERE I GOT ON A BOAT.

02:01:35.240 --> 02:01:37.240
AND ON THIS BOAT I WENT FROM 
ISLAND TO ISLAND TO ISLAND.

02:01:38.869 --> 02:01:40.965
PAPUA NEW GUINEA IS ALL TINY, 
TINY, TINY ISLANDS.

02:01:43.847 --> 02:01:45.847
MY FATHER SAID, AND I QUOTE:  
WHY YOU GOING TO PAPUA, NEW 

02:01:46.731 --> 02:01:49.196
GUINEA, MAN?
AND I SAID, WELL, SOMEONE IS 

02:01:49.197 --> 02:01:52.896
PAYING FOR A PLANE TAKE.
HE SAID WELL, ALL RIGHT, I MEAN,

02:01:52.897 --> 02:01:55.544
IF THEY'RE PAYING FOR THE PLANE 
TICKET.

02:01:58.202 --> 02:02:00.202
I GET TO ONE OF THESE TINY 
ISLANDS.

02:02:00.883 --> 02:02:02.930
I GET OFF THE BOAT THAT I'M ON 
AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THIS 

02:02:02.931 --> 02:02:05.785
ISLAND ARE EXCITED TO SEE 
SOMEONE GET OFF A BOAT WHO'S NOT

02:02:05.786 --> 02:02:08.246
WHITE, RIGHT?
THEY'RE BROWN PEOPLE.

02:02:10.679 --> 02:02:12.679
THEY RECOGNIZE, GAME RECOGNIZE 
GAME.

02:02:12.724 --> 02:02:14.724
AND THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF 
LIKE:  OH, HELLO!

02:02:16.651 --> 02:02:18.502
I WAS LIKE HEY, HOW YOU DOING?
SO I'M SITTING ON THIS ISLAND IN

02:02:24.806 --> 02:02:28.939
PAPUA, NEW GUINEA, AND I REALIZE
AFTER WALKING AROUND A LITTLE 

02:02:24.806 --> 02:02:27.575
BIT THAT THERE WERE NO MIRRORS 
ON THE ISLAND, AND THERE WERE NO

02:02:27.576 --> 02:02:30.353
PHOTOS ON THE ISLAND.
THERE WAS NO ELECTRICITY ON THE 

02:02:30.354 --> 02:02:33.596
ISLAND.
ALL THE HOUSES ARE THATCH HUTS 

02:02:33.597 --> 02:02:36.447
ON STILTS.
THERE'S ONE SCHOOL THAT IS MADE 

02:02:36.448 --> 02:02:40.930
OF CORRUGATED TIN.
IN THERE, OF COURSE, BECAUSE I 

02:02:40.931 --> 02:02:45.437
AM AT CORE A BOOK PERSON, THE 
BOOKS ARE ALL BRITISH COLONIAL 

02:02:45.438 --> 02:02:49.109
BOOKS, RIGHT?
AND SO WE'RE ON THIS ISLAND, 

02:02:49.110 --> 02:02:53.609
WITH ALMOST NO IMAGES, RIGHT?
THERE WAS ONE GUY WHO HAD A 

02:02:55.056 --> 02:02:57.080
PHOTO OF HIS GRANDFATHER.
HIS GRANDFATHER HAD PLAYED 

02:03:00.337 --> 02:03:02.808
SOCCER, AND THEREFORE LEFT THE 
ISLAND, AND WENT TO PORT 

02:03:04.665 --> 02:03:06.759
MOORESBY, THERE WAS A PHOTO OF 
HIM ON THE SOCCER TEAM AND THAT 

02:03:06.760 --> 02:03:10.223
WAS STUCK TO THE THATCH ROOF 
SIDE OF THE HUT.

02:03:12.474 --> 02:03:14.730
SO I WAS STRUCK BY BOTH THE 
UNIVERSALITY OF OUR PROBLEMS, 

02:03:14.731 --> 02:03:16.731
RIGHT?

02:03:19.982 --> 02:03:21.982
THAT EVEN IN THE THATCH ROOF 

02:03:23.188 --> 02:03:27.601
HUTS OF ANACOSTIA OR OF HARLEM 
OR BROOKLYN, WE'RE STILL 

02:03:28.836 --> 02:03:30.316
STARVING FOR IMAGES AND I WAS 
STRUCK BY THE IMMEDIACY OF WHAT 

02:03:30.317 --> 02:03:34.615
I COULD DO AND SO I SAT DOWN 
WITH MY PAD AND MY INK AND MY 

02:03:34.616 --> 02:03:38.345
BRUSHES, AND I DID WHAT I DO 
EVERYWHERE:  I SAID, CAN I MAKE 

02:03:38.346 --> 02:03:41.004
SOME IMAGES?
AND I PAINTED ALL THE KIDS ON 

02:03:41.005 --> 02:03:43.005
THIS ISLAND.
RIGHT?

02:03:45.980 --> 02:03:47.980
THE ISLAND HAS GOT MAYBE 250 
PEOPLE.

02:03:48.240 --> 02:03:50.684
OF THOSE 250 PEOPLE, THERE'S, 
LIKE, 75 THAT ARE KIDS.

02:03:52.707 --> 02:03:54.142
SO I SAT THERE AND I JUST 
WAITED, AND THE LONG LINE 

02:03:54.143 --> 02:03:57.237
STARTED.
AND IF YOU GO TO THIS ISLAND 

02:03:57.238 --> 02:04:01.595
THIS DAY ON THE SIDE OF THESE 
THATCH ROOF HUTS YOU'LL SEE ALSO

02:04:01.596 --> 02:04:05.062
LITTLE PAINTINGS OF THESE KIDS.
AS I WAS LEAVING THE ISLAND A 

02:04:05.063 --> 02:04:08.333
GUY NAMED EDISON, THAT WAS HIS 
NAME, BECAUSE AGAIN COLONIALISM 

02:04:08.334 --> 02:04:12.262
IS A BIG THING.
REALLY, FOLKS CAME OUT AND THEY 

02:04:12.263 --> 02:04:16.555
WERE WEARING TRADITIONAL GARB 
FROM THOUSANDS OF YEARS AND THE 

02:04:16.556 --> 02:04:20.438
DUDE INTRODUCED HIMSELF, THE GUY
WHO SPOKE ENGLISH SAID HELLO, 

02:04:20.439 --> 02:04:22.905
I'M EDISON.
I SAID OH, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

02:04:23.108 --> 02:04:25.954
[ LAUGHTER ]
HE SAID, THANK YOU, AND THANK 

02:04:25.955 --> 02:04:27.955
YOU FOR MY FAMILY.

02:04:30.639 --> 02:04:33.400
AND HE KIND OF GESTURED AT THE 
REST OF THE ISLAND.

02:04:35.210 --> 02:04:37.041
ONE OF THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO WAS 
ON THIS BOAT WITH ME SAID, IS 

02:04:37.042 --> 02:04:40.111
HE, LIKE, THE FATHER OF EVERYONE
ON THE ISLAND?

02:04:42.786 --> 02:04:45.429
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND I DIDN'T QUITE KNOW WHAT TO 

02:04:45.430 --> 02:04:48.703
SAY.
EXCEPT THAT I WAS ABLE TO -- I 

02:04:48.704 --> 02:04:50.750
WANTED TO COMMUNICATE TO THE 
PEOPLE ON THE BOAT WITH ME 

02:04:51.745 --> 02:04:53.588
BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO
NEEDED SOME EDUCATION THAT THERE

02:04:53.589 --> 02:04:58.135
ARE FAMILY STRUCTURES BEYOND 
WHAT YOU MAY KNOW.

02:05:00.816 --> 02:05:03.687
THIS HERE IS PART OF A FAMILY.
WHAT YOU GUYS ARE TO THE WORK 

02:05:06.951 --> 02:05:08.972
THAT WE ARE DOING IS FAMILY.
AND THIS IS A SPECIAL, SPECIAL 

02:05:08.973 --> 02:05:10.973
MOMENT IN THE LIBRARY OF 

02:05:12.860 --> 02:05:15.712
CONGRESS TO BE HERE WITH FAMILY.
THIS IS THAT UNORTHODOX FAMILY 

02:05:15.713 --> 02:05:19.003
STRUCTURE THAT WE ARE TALKING 
ABOUT.

02:05:21.253 --> 02:05:23.253
AND LIKE ALL FAMILIES, WE'VE GOT
CHARACTERS AND WE'VE GOT 

02:05:23.329 --> 02:05:25.974
CONFLICT.
WE'VE GOT UNEXPECTED GUEST STARS

02:05:30.044 --> 02:05:32.044
AND WE'VE GOT CAN'T-GET-RATE 

02:05:33.525 --> 02:05:35.525

SLACKER NEPHEWS AND COOL UNCLES:
JASON.

02:05:45.967 --> 02:05:47.967
JASON IS THE COOL UNCLE FOR 
EVERYBODY, RIGHT?

02:05:48.046 --> 02:05:50.046
[ LAUGHTER ]

02:05:51.324 --> 02:05:53.172
AND WE WILL FIGHT AMONGST 
OURSELVES, LIKE ALL THE GOOD 

02:05:53.173 --> 02:05:58.128
UNORTHODOX FAMILIES THAT I KNOW.
AND AS WE ALL SEE THAT WE HAVE 

02:05:58.129 --> 02:06:01.041
GOALS, WE WANT TO CHANGE THE 
INDUSTRY.

02:06:02.470 --> 02:06:05.347
WE WANT TO CHANGE THE LIVES OF 
THE CHILDREN THAT WE MEET, THE 

02:06:05.348 --> 02:06:09.253
CHILDREN THAT WE SO DESPERATELY 
CARE ABOUT AND WE'RE GOING TO 

02:06:12.516 --> 02:06:14.798
HAVE CONFLICT IN THAT MISSION 
AND I THINK THAT 5 YEARS IN IS A

02:06:14.799 --> 02:06:17.269
GOOD TIME TO NOTE THAT, AND TO 

02:06:21.221 --> 02:06:22.244
NOTE THAT OFTENTIMES, I'VE BEEN 
PART OF THESE CONVERSATIONS FOR 

02:06:22.245 --> 02:06:24.693
A LONG TIME.
I REMEMBER POP TALKING TO ME 

02:06:24.694 --> 02:06:28.144
ABOUT, MAN, LINDA SUE, SHE'S GOT
HER HEAD ON.

02:06:29.176 --> 02:06:31.176
SHE'S THINKING ABOUT IT.
SHE'S REALLY DOING IT.

02:06:34.101 --> 02:06:35.533
SHE'S THINKING OUTSIDE OF HER, 
JUST HER BOOKS, AND SHE'S TRYING

02:06:35.534 --> 02:06:39.016
TO THINK ABOUT WHAT TO DO IN A 
LARGER SENSE.

02:06:41.306 --> 02:06:43.306
AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE 
CONFLICT, AND I THINK THAT 

02:06:43.765 --> 02:06:45.218
THAT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE.
IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT EACH 

02:06:45.219 --> 02:06:50.111
OTHER AND SAY:  I KNOW YOU'RE ON
THE SAME SIDE, EVEN THOUGH I 

02:06:53.175 --> 02:06:54.821
DON'T LIKE THE WAY YOU'RE GOING 
ABOUT SOLVING THIS PROBLEM, BUT 

02:06:54.822 --> 02:06:58.296
ALL OF THESE SOLUTIONS TOGETHER,
THAT IS WHAT MAKES THE RIPPLE 

02:06:58.297 --> 02:07:02.320
INTO A WAVE.
AND WE'RE AT THAT MOMENT WHERE 5

02:07:02.321 --> 02:07:04.321
YEARS, WE'RE ALL REAL.
WE'RE HERE.

02:07:04.783 --> 02:07:07.014
WE'RE STILL A FAMILY.
AND WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT.

02:07:09.319 --> 02:07:12.590
YOU KNOW, AND LIKE FAMILIES, I 
THINK PEOPLE ASSUME, ESPECIALLY 

02:07:12.591 --> 02:07:16.297
WITH MY POP, THAT I GREW UP WITH
SOMEBODY WHO WAS LIKE:  LET YOUR

02:07:16.298 --> 02:07:19.619
CREATIVE HEART SING, MY CHILD.
[ LAUGHTER ]

02:07:21.449 --> 02:07:23.449
I DID NOT.

02:07:25.778 --> 02:07:28.253
I GREW UP WITH A WRITER WHO WAS 
CRITICAL AND SLIGHTLY MEAN.

02:07:28.464 --> 02:07:31.320
[ LAUGHTER ]
I GREW UP WITH SOMEONE WHO, WHEN

02:07:31.321 --> 02:07:34.385
I WAS VERY YOUNG, I WASN'T 
ALLOWED TO SAY I HAD AN IDEA FOR

02:07:34.386 --> 02:07:36.606
A BOOK.
I HAD TO GIVE HIM AN OUTLINE.

02:07:36.816 --> 02:07:42.556
[ LAUGHTER ]
ALL GOOD TRAINING.

02:07:44.004 --> 02:07:45.881
BUT THAT KIND OF DEBATE THAT 
EVERY CREATIVE PERSON IN THIS 

02:07:45.882 --> 02:07:49.993
ROOM UNDERSTANDS FOR THEMSELVES,
BECAUSE YOU'VE HAD THAT FIGHT 

02:07:49.994 --> 02:07:51.994
WITH THE BOOKS THAT YOU'VE 
WRITTEN.

02:07:53.503 --> 02:07:55.503
YOU'VE HAD THAT FIGHT WITH 
YOURSELF.

02:07:55.546 --> 02:07:57.546
THAT IS THE KIND OF FATE THAT WE
NEED TO HAVE TOGETHER.

02:08:00.005 --> 02:08:01.629
AND IT'S SO GOOD TO HAVE THESE 
CONVERSATIONS ON THESE STAGES 

02:08:04.903 --> 02:08:06.949
WHERE WE THINK ABOUT THINGS 
LIKE, WELL, DO WE WANT TO THINK 

02:08:06.950 --> 02:08:10.227
OF THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING A 
PERSON OF COLOR IN THIS COUNTRY 

02:08:10.228 --> 02:08:13.788
AS BEING SIMPLY ABOUT TRAUMA?
HOW DO WE HOLD TRAUMA?

02:08:15.022 --> 02:08:17.499
HOW DO WE NOT HOLD IT?
IS THERE A WAY TO LET IT GO?

02:08:19.356 --> 02:08:21.821
THESE ARE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS.
AND JUST LIKE MY FATHER SAT 

02:08:24.893 --> 02:08:27.137
THERE AND SAID, "MAN, THAT DON'T
SOUND RIGHT," I'M LIKE, BUT IT 

02:08:27.138 --> 02:08:30.067
WOULD BE A GOOD STORY AND IT 
WOULD SELL.

02:08:31.711 --> 02:08:33.711
AND HE GOES, YEAH, BUT WE CAN DO
BETTER.

02:08:33.982 --> 02:08:37.030
THAT'S OUR JOB.
WE'RE GOING PLACES AS A FAMILY.

02:08:37.843 --> 02:08:43.172
WE ARE TRYING TO BUILD A WAY 
FORWARD, AND IT'S A GIFT TO SEE 

02:08:43.173 --> 02:08:47.034
THE CONTINUITY OF THIS FAMILY.
BECAUSE AS I SAID, I'VE BEEN 

02:08:47.035 --> 02:08:49.944
SEEING THIS SINCE I WAS A KID, 

02:08:53.835 --> 02:08:55.835
WITH SITTING WITH NICOLASA

YEPP, FOLKS WHO HAVE PASSED OR 

02:09:01.213 --> 02:09:04.280
WE LOVED, THIS IS THE CONTINUITY
OF FAMILY.

02:09:05.930 --> 02:09:09.826
THAT'S WHAT FAMILY MEANS.
AND SO WE FIND OURSELVES HERE, 

02:09:12.895 --> 02:09:14.968
THROWN UP ON AN ISLAND, WITH 
THIS VERY FEW IMAGES.

02:09:17.013 --> 02:09:19.465
THERE'S NOT MIRRORS, PERHAPS.
THERE'S NOT PHOTOS.

02:09:21.752 --> 02:09:24.639
AND OUR JOB IS TO DO WHAT I DID 
ON THAT ISLAND THAT DAY -- WE 

02:09:24.640 --> 02:09:26.640
SIT THERE, AND WE SIT AND WE 

02:09:30.409 --> 02:09:32.881
DRAW EACH AND EVERY KID, AND WE 
MAY THIS -- WE HOPE THAT ALL OF 

02:09:32.882 --> 02:09:36.577
THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE CAN 
EVENTUALLY PASTE THEIR PICTURE 

02:09:39.864 --> 02:09:41.864

BECAUSE WE ARE A FAMILY.
WE LOOK OUT FOR EACH OTHER AND I

CONTINUITY OF MY OWN FAMILY BOTH

LARGER ONE OF PEOPLE WHO CARE

THIS IS SUCH AN HONOR AND THIS 

02:16:49.572 --> 02:16:53.026
IS ALSO THE CAPSTONE OF MY 
CAREER, IT REALLY AND TRULY IS.

02:16:53.229 --> 02:16:56.109
WHEN I WAS ASKED TO WRITE "GHOST

02:16:59.646 --> 02:17:01.494

LITTLE BROWN, OH, JEWELL, DO YOU

02:17:01.495 --> 02:17:03.514
WANT TO WRITE ABOUT THE MURDER

OF COURSE NOT.

EMOTIONALLY.

02:17:17.452 --> 02:17:19.470
BUT MAY TWO EDITORS ALVENA LING 
AND ALLISON MOORE KNEW THAT I 

02:17:19.471 --> 02:17:21.471
HAD BEEN GOING THROUGH A LOT OF 

02:17:24.614 --> 02:17:26.668
INCIDENCES WATCHING AS MY YOUNG 
CHILD GREW AND BECAME THE 

02:17:29.300 --> 02:17:32.377
SUBJECT OF MORE RACISM AND 
RACIAL BIAS.

02:17:36.272 --> 02:17:38.272
I ALSO HAD CHILDHOOD MEMORIES OF
EMMA TILL.

02:17:38.524 --> 02:17:40.755
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP, THE 
PICTURES OF EMMA TILL IN THIS 

02:17:40.756 --> 02:17:44.876
COFFIN ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF HIS
DEATH WERE JUST STREWN 

02:17:46.505 --> 02:17:48.505
THROUGHOUT OUR HOME.

02:17:51.846 --> 02:17:54.485
WE WERE ENGAGED IN SEEING RACISM
IN OUR WORLD I THINK BECAUSE MY 

02:17:54.486 --> 02:18:00.050
GRANDPARENTS WANTED TO PROTECT 
US IN THEIR WAY FROM RACISM.

02:18:03.111 --> 02:18:05.111
BUT THE IMAGES OF EMMETT HAVE 

02:18:06.612 --> 02:18:08.612
HAUNTED ME FOR OVER 65 YEARS, 

02:18:10.513 --> 02:18:12.513
AND I STILL SEE IMAGES OF MEN 

02:18:13.994 --> 02:18:16.836
AND WOMEN WHO WERE LYNCHED, 
BURNED, AND CORKSCREWED, SOME 

02:18:19.914 --> 02:18:21.914
BEFORE AND SOME POST-DEATH.

THIS STEW OF PASSION, AND I 

02:18:29.330 --> 02:18:31.330
THOUGHT I HAD BEEN WRITING ALL 

02:18:32.810 --> 02:18:34.810
THESE YEARS, PRACTICING SO HARD,

02:18:36.062 --> 02:18:38.062

IMPOSSIBLE BOOK?

ADULT NOVELS THAT I WROTE, WHICH

WE CAN FORGET ABOUT --
[ LAUGHTER ]

02:18:46.268 --> 02:18:48.139

PRACTICE BOOKS FOR TRYING TO 

02:18:51.824 --> 02:18:53.443
BECOME GOOD ENOUGH TO WRITE FOR

BOOKS.

02:19:07.783 --> 02:19:09.783
SO I SAID:  SURE, I'LL GIVE IT A
TRY.

02:19:11.289 --> 02:19:13.551
AND I MENTIONED TO ALVENA:  
OKAY, I CAN WRITE IT IF I HAVE 

02:19:13.552 --> 02:19:16.875

SHE TELL ME SHE WAS REALLY 

02:19:18.505 --> 02:19:20.505
WORRIED ABOUT ME.

02:19:21.187 --> 02:19:23.187

02:19:24.884 --> 02:19:27.120
BUT I WENT AHEAD AND STARTED THE
BOOK, AND FOR 2.5 YEARS, THE 

02:19:27.121 --> 02:19:29.168
BOOK NEARLY UNDID ME.

02:19:32.669 --> 02:19:35.334
I WOULD WRITE 28 PAGES, AND THEN
SEND THEM OFF TO ALVENA AND SAY:

02:19:35.335 --> 02:19:38.444
THAT'S IT, I'M DONE.
AND SHE'D SAY:  IT'S A LITTLE 

02:19:38.445 --> 02:19:40.445
SHORT.
[ LAUGHTER ]

02:19:40.478 --> 02:19:42.478

SEND IT OFF TO ALVENA AND 

02:19:44.341 --> 02:19:46.809
ALLISON:  THAT'S IT, I'M DONE!
IT CAME OUT IN BITS AND PIECES, 

02:19:46.810 --> 02:19:50.473
AND IN BETWEEN, I WOULD READ THE
COLOR OF LAW.

02:19:53.526 --> 02:19:55.526
I WOULD READ "MERCY," I WOULD 

02:19:57.009 --> 02:19:59.250
STUDY MORE HISTORY AND I WOULD 
JUST WEEP AND CRY.

02:20:03.157 --> 02:20:08.481

WALTER DEAN MYERS.

02:20:10.758 --> 02:20:13.422

TEENAGER, AS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN

02:20:13.423 --> 02:20:16.062
SCHOLAR, AND AS A MOTHER WITH MY

02:20:19.730 --> 02:20:21.730
DAUGHTER, AND IN MY HEART, I 

02:20:24.831 --> 02:20:26.249
KNEW THAT TO BE 1/10 AS 
TALENTED, IMAGINATIVE, CREATIVE 

02:20:26.250 --> 02:20:31.405
AS WALTER DEAN MYERS, I JUST 
MIGHT MAKE IT THROUGH.

02:20:34.524 --> 02:20:36.524
HIS COMMITMENT TO THE LEGACY OF 

02:20:38.410 --> 02:20:40.410
DIVERSITY, HIS COMMITMENT TO 

02:20:43.794 --> 02:20:45.652
EXCELLENCE, JUST SHY SHINED.
SO YOU KNOW WHAT I PICKED UP?

02:20:45.653 --> 02:20:47.708
MONSTER.
AND IT SEEMED SO RIGHT THAT 

02:20:51.024 --> 02:20:53.301
TODAY IS 20th ANNIVERSARY 
PUBLICATION DATE OF "MONSTER," 

02:20:53.302 --> 02:20:56.393
AND I'M HERE ACCEPTING HIS 
AWARD.

02:20:59.483 --> 02:21:01.714
I GOT TO MEET HIM.
WHEN I FINALLY STARTED MY FIRST 

02:21:01.715 --> 02:21:06.002
BOOK FOR CHILDREN, 9th WARD, 
AND I WAS AT THE CORETTA SCOTT 

02:21:06.003 --> 02:21:11.750
KING AWARDS, AND GUESS WHO WAS 
STANDING BEHIND ME?

02:21:14.002 --> 02:21:16.002
OH, I FANGIRLED.
[ LAUGHTER ]

02:21:17.898 --> 02:21:21.167
IT WAS EMBARRASSING.
[ LAUGHTER ]

02:21:22.045 --> 02:21:24.490
I WAS A SHRIMP.
HE WAS JUST SO WONDERFUL, AND I 

02:21:24.491 --> 02:21:28.808
WAS SO STRUCK BY HIS KINDNESS.
HIS HUMILITY.

02:21:30.688 --> 02:21:31.911
HE WAS JUST ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL
AND I THOUGHT THIS WAS A SIGN 

02:21:31.912 --> 02:21:34.981
THAT, YES, I WAS FINALLY A 
CHILDREN'S AUTHOR.

02:21:37.031 --> 02:21:39.485
AND I CALLED MY DAUGHTER, KELLY,
AND SAID:  GUESS WHO I MET 

02:21:39.486 --> 02:21:41.563
TODAY?
AND I THINK FOR THE FIRST TIME 

02:21:44.866 --> 02:21:46.866
EVER, I WAS COOL FOR MY 
DAUGHTER!

02:21:47.543 --> 02:21:49.543
I WAS SO, SO COOL.

02:21:53.422 --> 02:21:56.960
SO I TOLD KID INSPIRATION, HIS 
LODE STAR OF EXCELLENCE AND I 

02:21:56.961 --> 02:22:01.664
BEGAN WRITING "GHOST BOYS."
NOW, I ALWAYS FELT THAT EMMETT 

02:22:05.101 --> 02:22:07.101
TILL WAS INNOCENT, THAT HE DID 
NOT SAY:  HEY, BABY.

02:22:09.628 --> 02:22:11.628
HE DID NOT WHISTLE AT MISS 
CAROLYN BRYANT.

02:22:13.312 --> 02:22:15.312
HE WAS NOT SEXUALLY ASSAULTTIVE.

02:22:16.596 --> 02:22:18.896
AND YET FOR OVER 60 YEARS, THERE
WAS ALL THESE BOOKS THAT I READ,

02:22:18.897 --> 02:22:24.618
INCLUDING BOOKS FOR CHILDREN, 
ALL THIS NEWS ON THE INTERNET 

02:22:24.619 --> 02:22:26.619
THAT ALWAYS SUGGESTED THAT 

02:22:30.551 --> 02:22:33.197
SOMEHOW, THE VICTIM MAY HAVE 
DONE SOMETHING WRONG.

02:22:34.838 --> 02:22:36.838
WELL, TO ME, THAT WAS 
IMPOSSIBLE.

02:22:39.122 --> 02:22:41.165
BUT I WROTE THE STORY, WROTE THE
SCENE, AND THEN BILL BRYSON CAME

02:22:41.166 --> 02:22:45.308
OUT WITH HIS BOOK CALLED, THE 
BLOOD OF EMMETT TILL, IN HIS 

02:22:45.309 --> 02:22:47.309
MISS CAROLYN BRYANT FINALLY 

02:22:50.647 --> 02:22:52.647
SAID, AT THE AGE OF 82, "I LIED.
THAT BOY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING 

02:22:54.578 --> 02:22:58.066
WORTH DYING FOR.
AND IN FACT, THIS IS WHAT AS FAR

02:22:58.067 --> 02:23:02.566
AS WE KNOW EMMETT TRULY DID."
HE WALKED INTO A STORE, READY 

02:23:02.567 --> 02:23:05.461
TO GET SOME CANDY.
HE GAVE HER THE PENNY FOR THE 

02:23:05.462 --> 02:23:10.551
CANDY, AND HE MAYBE, JUST MAYBE,
MIGHT HAVE TOUCHED HER FINGERS, 

02:23:10.552 --> 02:23:12.614
OR HER PALM, WHICH WAS SOMETHING
YOU SHOULDN'T DO.

02:23:15.072 --> 02:23:17.519
YOU DIDN'T TOUCH A WHITE WOMAN 
IN 1950s, BUT WHO KNOWS, YOU 

02:23:17.520 --> 02:23:21.466
KNOW?
AND THEN AFTERWARDS, HE WALKED 

02:23:21.467 --> 02:23:24.305
TO THE DOOR AND HE TURNED AROUND
AND SAID, GOODBYE.

02:23:25.337 --> 02:23:27.337
THAT'S IT!
THAT'S IT!

02:23:28.433 --> 02:23:31.276
AND I SPOKE TO MY WONDROUS 
EDITORS AT LITTLE BROWN ALLISON 

02:23:31.277 --> 02:23:35.794
AND ALVENA, AND I SAID, OH, SEND
ME BACK MY MANUSCRIPT, BECAUSE 

02:23:35.795 --> 02:23:37.795
IT WAS ALREADY IN COPY EDITING, 
RIGHT?

02:23:38.907 --> 02:23:41.374
AND I SAID SEND IT BACK.
AND I WAS ABLE TO REWRITE THAT 

02:23:45.251 --> 02:23:47.069
SCENE, WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE
REAL TRUTH, THAT THE CHILD WAS 

02:23:47.070 --> 02:23:49.732
INNOCENT.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

02:23:51.572 --> 02:23:53.572
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

02:23:55.293 --> 02:23:58.795
AH, EMMETT.
I ALSO LATER ON, BECAUSE THE 

02:23:58.796 --> 02:24:01.844
BOOKS STAY WITH ME AND I JUST 
THINK AND DREAM ABOUT THEM, WAS 

02:24:01.845 --> 02:24:07.162
ABLE TO MAKE ANOTHER CHANGE, 
NAMELY AFTER THE BOOK WAS IN AN 

02:24:11.056 --> 02:24:13.715
ARC, AND CARLOS WHO HAS GIVEN 
MAY CHARACTER JEROME THE TOY GUN

02:24:13.716 --> 02:24:17.175
HAS THIS MOMENT WITH HIS FATHER 
SAYING THAT HE FEELS GUILTY 

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.916
ABOUT GIVING THIS TOY GUN, BUT 
THERE'S A BEAT THAT I MISSED, 

02:24:21.917 --> 02:24:27.493
NAMELY THAT AS A CHILD OF COLOR,
AS AN HISPANIC AMERICAN, IT 

02:24:30.156 --> 02:24:32.156
COULD EQUALLY HAVE BEEN CARLOS 

02:24:34.651 --> 02:24:35.667
WHO WAS SHOT, TOO SO THAT TO ME 
WAS IMPORTANT TO ADD IN, THAT 

02:24:35.668 --> 02:24:39.777
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO BE AFRICAN 
AMERICAN, BUT SIMPLY A CHILD OF 

02:24:39.778 --> 02:24:44.470
COLOR, AND OUR SOCIETY CAN MAKE 
AN EXCUSE FOR WHY YOU, AMONG 

02:24:44.471 --> 02:24:47.539
OTHERS, DO NOT DESERVE TO LIVE.

02:24:52.265 --> 02:24:54.265
SO ONCE AGAIN, MAY WONDROUS MY

HUG, HUG.

OKAY, JEWELL, WILL YOU MAKE THIS
CHANGE?

02:25:00.689 --> 02:25:02.736
ALVENA LINK AT LITTLE BROWN IS 
THE KIND OF EDITOR THAT ALWAYS 

02:25:02.737 --> 02:25:07.223
ASKS THE PROBING QUESTIONS THAT 
SORT OF TOOK ME DOWN ANOTHER 

02:25:07.224 --> 02:25:09.224
PATH, AND LAIRING THE NOVEL AND 

02:25:13.797 --> 02:25:15.797
FOR THAT, I'M ETERNALLY 
GRATEFUL.

ALLISON MOORE KNOWS A JEWELL 
PARKER RHODES SENTENCE BETTER

IT DOES INDEED TAKE A VILLAGE.
NOW, I'M GOING TO TELL Y'ALL A 

02:25:31.780 --> 02:25:36.916
SECRET, OKAY?
IN 2014, MY DAUGHTER JUST HAD 

02:25:36.917 --> 02:25:40.814
HER BABY, AND EVERYBODY HAD TOLD
HER THAT IF YOU'RE A WRITER, YOU

02:25:40.815 --> 02:25:43.300
CAN'T BE A MOM.
YOUR LIFE IS OVER.

02:25:45.336 --> 02:25:48.051
AND IN FACT, WHEN I BECAME A 
MOM, THAT WAS WHEN MY LIFE 

02:25:49.075 --> 02:25:51.118
BEGAN, AND PARTICULARLY AS A 
WRITER, I TRIED SO HARD, BECAUSE

02:25:51.119 --> 02:25:56.046
I WANTED TO BE ABLE TO SAY TO MY
LITTLE GIRL:  DON'T GIVE UP.

02:25:58.507 --> 02:25:59.772
SO HERE'S KELLY, AND I'M TELLING
HER, YOU'RE GOING TO BE ALL 

02:25:59.773 --> 02:26:00.781
RIGHT.
YOU'RE GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.

02:26:04.277 --> 02:26:06.716
AND SHE APPLIES FOR A WNDB 
FELLOWSHIP, AND SHE WAS ONE OF 

02:26:10.785 --> 02:26:12.426

Y'ALL UNDERSTAND AS HER MAMA 
WHAT I HAD TO SAY HAD NOTHING TO

02:26:32.273 --> 02:26:36.394
DO WITH IT.
THAT AS A MAMA YOU CAN DISCOUNT 

02:26:36.395 --> 02:26:38.848

YES, YOU'RE GOOD.

02:26:39.917 --> 02:26:41.917

02:33:36.440 --> 02:33:38.440
PURPOSE^, THE MUSICALITY OF THE 
NARRATIVE AND VERSE.

02:33:40.511 --> 02:33:42.804
AGAIN, FROM CO-CHAIR MARIA 
SALVADOR:  THE POET X PRESENTS 

02:33:42.805 --> 02:33:47.947
AN AUTHENTIC STORY IN LANGUAGE 
THAT SCREAMS TO BE READ ALOUD, 

02:33:52.249 --> 02:33:54.249
JUST AS THE AMARA'S OWN POETRY 
DOES.

02:33:58.153 --> 02:33:59.155
LIKE MANY YOUNG PEOPLE JIAMARA 
SEEMS SIMULTANEOUSLY SEEN AND 

02:33:59.156 --> 02:34:01.190
INVISIBLE IN HER WORLD.

02:34:04.675 --> 02:34:06.675
READERS, PLEASE WELCOME 

02:34:07.714 --> 02:34:09.714
ELIZABETH ACEVEDO, WINNER OF THE

02:34:11.599 --> 02:34:13.674
WALTER TEEN AWARD FOR "THE POET 
X."

02:34:14.690 --> 02:34:16.690
[ APPLAUSE ]

02:34:32.943 --> 02:34:34.943
] ]   GOOD AFTERNOON.
SORRY FOR NOT FOLLOWING 

02:34:35.177 --> 02:34:37.177
DIRECTIONS.
I'VE GOT HEELS ON.

02:34:38.849 --> 02:34:40.849
I CAN ONLY GO SO FAR, DOING THE 
BEST I CAN.

02:34:42.159 --> 02:34:43.783
THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE SEEN ME 
SPEAK BEFORE, YOU KNOW I OFTEN 

02:34:43.784 --> 02:34:47.046
GO OFF THE CUFF.
I WANTED TO TRY SOMETHING NEW SO

02:34:47.047 --> 02:34:49.547
I'M GOING TO READ THINGS I 
WROTE.

02:34:53.420 --> 02:34:56.289
MOSTLY.
IT IS AN HONOR TO BE HERE TODAY,

02:34:56.290 --> 02:34:59.362
TO BE IN THIS SPACE.
I FEEL LIKE I'M IN THE 

02:35:00.596 --> 02:35:03.224
INTERSECTION OF SEVERAL PARTS OF
MY LIFE.

02:35:06.312 --> 02:35:08.312
I WANT TO TELL YOU ALL SOMETHING
ABOUT WHAT LINDA SUE SAID.

02:35:10.642 --> 02:35:12.071
I TAUGHT 8th GRADE ENGLISH IN 
PRINCE GEORGES COUNTY, MARYLAND.

02:35:12.072 --> 02:35:16.772
OH, YEAH, SHOUT OUT TO THE 
TEACHERS IN THE ROOM, RIGHT?

02:35:19.865 --> 02:35:21.865
I TAUGHT AT A SCHOOL THAT WAS 

02:35:23.774 --> 02:35:26.636
78% LATINX, 18% BLACK.
IT WAS A COOL THAT NEVER HAD A 

02:35:29.730 --> 02:35:31.730
LATIN X TEACHER TEACH A LATIN 
SUBJECT.

02:35:31.767 --> 02:35:33.176
THEY NEVER HAD A LATINA TEACHING
THERE AT ALL AND THERE WAS A 

02:35:33.177 --> 02:35:37.091
CONNECTION I FELT WITH MY 
STUDENTS THAT WENT BEYOND JUST 

02:35:37.092 --> 02:35:39.092
WITHSTANDING IN FRONT OF THE 
ROOM.

02:35:40.169 --> 02:35:41.590
THE REASON I GOT SCHOLARSHIPS TO
UNDERGRAD, THAT I WAS ABLE TO 

02:35:41.591 --> 02:35:45.867
LEAVE THE COMMUNITY I LEFT WHICH
WAS AT TIMES A ROUGH COMMUNITY 

02:35:45.868 --> 02:35:48.996
WAS BECAUSE OF MY LOVE FOR 
READING BECAUSE I WAS A 

02:35:50.211 --> 02:35:51.224
VORACIOUS READER AND I CAME 
THROUGH A TEACHING PROGRAM THAT 

02:35:51.225 --> 02:35:54.886
I WASN'T SURE PREPARED ME TO DO 
THE JOB I HAD, WHICH WAS TO 

02:35:58.386 --> 02:35:59.603
STAND IN FRONT OF 150, 13
13-16-YEAR-OLDS AND TEACH THEM 

02:35:59.604 --> 02:36:03.077
HOW TO READ.
MANY OF WHOM WERE ON A 5th 

02:36:04.718 --> 02:36:06.718
GRADE READING LEVEL, AND THE 
ONLY THING THAT I HAD AS A 

02:36:08.371 --> 02:36:10.209
GUIDING LIGHT WAS I HAVE TO 
TEACH THEM HOW TO LOVE READING.

02:36:10.210 --> 02:36:12.843
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT OBJECTIVES.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT NO STATE 

02:36:13.663 --> 02:36:16.335
TESTS.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE F.S.

02:36:20.204 --> 02:36:22.204
WHAT THE F.A.S.T. 
IS.

02:36:23.313 --> 02:36:25.313
WHAT I KNOW --
[ APPLAUSE ]

02:36:26.165 --> 02:36:27.792
WHAT I KNOW IS THAT IF THEY LOVE
TO READ, THEY WILL FIGURE IT 

02:36:27.793 --> 02:36:29.793
OUT.
RIGHT?

02:36:29.845 --> 02:36:31.845
AND THAT WAS THE ONE THING THAT 
KEPT ME GOING.

02:36:33.914 --> 02:36:35.969
AND I HAD THIS STUDENT WHO WAS 
REAL SLICK AT THE MOUTH, ALWAYS 

02:36:35.970 --> 02:36:39.415
HAD SOMETHING SMART TO SAY.
THE KIND OF KID WHO IF YOU'RE A 

02:36:39.416 --> 02:36:42.560
TEACHER YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BE 
LIKE THAT'S REALLY APPROPRIATE 

02:36:42.561 --> 02:36:45.018
AND ON THE INSIDE, YOU'RE LIKE, 
YOU'RE SO WITTY.

02:36:46.438 --> 02:36:48.438
I WISH I COULD AFFIRM THIS PART 
OF YOU, RIGHT?

02:36:48.899 --> 02:36:50.899
CLASSROOM MANAGEMENT DOES NOT 
ALLOW ME TO DO THAT.

02:36:52.383 --> 02:36:54.383
AND THE STUDENT WOULD TELL ME, 
I'M NOT A READER.

02:36:55.248 --> 02:36:57.136
I'M NOT A READER.
AND I ASKED HER ONE DAY, WHAT IS

02:36:57.137 --> 02:36:59.826
IT THAT YOU WANT?
LIKE, WHAT BOOK CAN I GET?

02:37:01.235 --> 02:37:03.062
WHAT WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN?
BECAUSE I HAD PUT EVERYTHING IN 

02:37:03.063 --> 02:37:05.493
FRONT OF HER I THOUGHT IT WAS 
COOL.

02:37:07.372 --> 02:37:08.624
I WAS GIVING HER HUNGER GAMES, 
TWILIGHT, WHATEVER IS EXCITING 

02:37:08.625 --> 02:37:11.076
AT THE TIME.
SHE SAID I DON'T CARE ABOUT NO 

02:37:11.077 --> 02:37:14.341
SPARKLY VAMPIRES.
I DON'T CARE ABOUT KILLING NO 

02:37:14.342 --> 02:37:16.817
KIDS FOR FOOD, RIGHT?
LIKE...

02:37:17.225 --> 02:37:19.257
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHERE ARE THE BOOKS ABOUT US?

02:37:20.101 --> 02:37:22.101
WHERE ARE THE BOOKS ABOUT US?

02:37:26.405 --> 02:37:28.657
AND SO I WENT OUT AND I BOUGHT 
JULIO ALVAREZ, I GOT NIKKI 

02:37:32.754 --> 02:37:34.394
GRIMES AND JACQUELINE WOODSON.
I GOT ALL THESE BOOKS I HAD WHEN

02:37:34.395 --> 02:37:38.474
I WAS HER AGE THAT FELT LIKE I 
WAS SPEAKING TO MY EXPERIENCES.

02:37:38.475 --> 02:37:41.324
WITHIN TWO WEEKS THE STUDENT WHO
TOLD ME SHE WAS NOT A READ 

02:37:43.168 --> 02:37:45.168
FINISHED I'VE REG I PUT IN FRONT

02:37:46.239 --> 02:37:48.239
OF HER AND SHE LOOKED AT ME AND 
SAID, WHAT'S NEXT?

02:37:49.715 --> 02:37:51.715
THAT'S ALL MY BOOKS, AND MY 
TEACHER BUDGET.

02:37:52.575 --> 02:37:54.441
I'M LIKE WE'RE DONE HERE BUT 
THOSE TWO QUESTIONS, THAT WAS 

02:37:58.117 --> 02:38:00.117
THE FIRST SPARK I HAD:  MAYBE I 
CAN WRITE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE.

02:38:01.373 --> 02:38:03.373
I'D BEEN A POET FOR MANY YEARS 
BUT I DID NOT EVER WRITE 

02:38:05.061 --> 02:38:07.130
SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS 
DEMOGRAPHIC BUT HERE WAS THIS 

02:38:07.131 --> 02:38:09.157
STUDENT WHO WAS ASKING ME, 
WHAT'S NEXT?

02:38:11.647 --> 02:38:13.946
AND THIS MOMENT OF:  WHY NOT ME?
WHY CAN'T I BE NEXT?

02:38:16.243 --> 02:38:18.243
HERE I AM TRYING TO TEACH THEM A
LOVE OF READING.

02:38:18.498 --> 02:38:20.498
I KNOW WHAT THEY WANT TO READ.
I KNOW HOW TO WRITE.

02:38:22.391 --> 02:38:23.824
I LOVE THE BOOKS THEY'RE 
READING, I CAN FIGURE THIS OUT 

02:38:23.825 --> 02:38:27.778
SO IT WAS REALLY THAT SPARK OF 
BEING AN EDUCATOR AND WANTING TO

02:38:27.779 --> 02:38:31.642
SEE MY KIDS AND WANTING THEM TO 
SEE THEMSELVES THAT PUSHED ME 

02:38:31.643 --> 02:38:34.286
FORWARD.
IT WAS IN THIS CAPACITY AS A 

02:38:34.287 --> 02:38:37.576
TEACHER THAT I WAS ABLE TO BRING
SO MANY BOOKS INTO CLASS THAT I 

02:38:37.577 --> 02:38:40.451
WOULD READ OUT LOUD, AND SOME OF
MY FAVORITE BOOKS TO READ WERE 

02:38:40.452 --> 02:38:43.918
WALTER DEAN MYERS BOOKS, PARTLY 
BECAUSE THEY WERE SO NEW YORK AT

02:38:43.919 --> 02:38:46.967
TIMES, RIGHT?
LIKE, 145th STREET IS ONE OF 

02:38:46.968 --> 02:38:49.458
THE MOST HARLEM BOOKS IN THE 
WORLD AND I LOVE BEING ABLE TO 

02:38:49.459 --> 02:38:52.528
BE LIKE I DON'T KNOW ABOUT 
Y'ALL, KIDS, BUT I'M GOING TO 

02:38:52.529 --> 02:38:55.597
ENJOY THIS PROCESS, RIGHT?
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL FOR ME TO HAVE 

02:38:55.598 --> 02:38:58.474
KIDS DISCOVER MONSTER AND 
REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST READ 

02:39:00.509 --> 02:39:02.960
MONSTER TO TALK ABOUT SLAM AND 
THE POWER OF THAT BOOK AND THE 

02:39:02.961 --> 02:39:05.399
POWER OF BASKETBALL AND SPORTS 
IN OUR LIVES ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU

02:39:05.400 --> 02:39:08.496
COME FROM CERTAIN COMMUNITIES, 
WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE HERE ARE THE 

02:39:08.497 --> 02:39:10.345
EXIT TICKETS.
HERE'S WHAT WE HAVE AND BE ABLE 

02:39:10.346 --> 02:39:14.441
TO CONNECT IN THAT WAY AND SO I 
WAS SO THANKFUL, RIGHT, TO DO 

02:39:14.442 --> 02:39:17.097
THAT JOB.
BUT I ALSO KNEW I WANTED TO 

02:39:19.135 --> 02:39:21.135
FOCUS ON CREATIVE WRITING, AND 
IN 2012 AFTER TWO YEARS OF 

02:39:24.267 --> 02:39:26.742
TEACHING, I LEFT TO GO TO THE, 
TO GET MY MFA IN CREATIVE 

02:39:27.756 --> 02:39:29.756
WRITING AT THE UNIVERSITY OF 
MARYLAND.

02:39:29.823 --> 02:39:31.465
MY FIRST INTERNSHIP AND THE ONLY
INTERNSHIP I'VE EVER HELD WAS 

02:39:31.466 --> 02:39:34.565
HERE AT THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS 
IN THE POETRY AND LITERATURE 

02:39:34.566 --> 02:39:36.566
CENTER UPSTAIRS SO THE FIRST 

02:39:40.289 --> 02:39:41.947
EVENT I WENT TO WAS NA A TASHA, 
THE POLE LAUREATE, READING ON 

02:39:41.948 --> 02:39:44.594
THIS STAGE.
SHE WAS SO COOL.

02:39:45.810 --> 02:39:47.847
SHE CAME FROM THE BACK.
WHEN I WALKED IN HERE TODAY I 

02:39:47.848 --> 02:39:51.320
WAS LIKE OH, SNAP.
ABOUT TO GET MY NATASHA ON, 

02:39:51.521 --> 02:39:53.159
RIGHT?
BUT THAT IT FEELS LIKE A HOME 

02:39:53.160 --> 02:39:57.873
COMING TO BE IN THIS SPACE, TO 
BE RECEIVING THIS AWARD, TO BE 

02:39:57.874 --> 02:40:00.760
LOOKING AT THE YOUNG PEOPLE FROM
THIS AREA, IN THIS RAM, TO KNOW 

02:40:00.761 --> 02:40:04.500
THAT I WAS -- ROOM TO KNOW THAT 
I WAS WRITING FOR YOU ALL IN THE

02:40:04.501 --> 02:40:07.549
FIRST PLACE.
I WANT TO JUST TELL YOU A LITTLE

02:40:07.550 --> 02:40:11.873
BIT MORE BEFORE I HOP OFF STAGE.
I WAS WRITING YOUNG ADULT IN 

02:40:11.874 --> 02:40:14.138
SECRET.
THE PROGRAM THAT I WAS IN DID 

02:40:14.139 --> 02:40:17.816
NOT FEEL LIKE ONE WHERE I COULD 
BRING IN CHILDREN'S LITERATURE, 

02:40:17.817 --> 02:40:21.711
AND IT BE RECEIVED WELL.
THAT WHEN YOU ARE IN THE HIGH 

02:40:25.603 --> 02:40:26.826
ARTS, OR THE FINE ARTS, THERE 
ARE VERY SPECIFIC IDEAS OF WHAT 

02:40:26.827 --> 02:40:30.520
THAT HAS TO SOUND LIKE SO I WAS 
WRITING ON THE METRO UP TO GREEN

02:40:30.521 --> 02:40:32.563
BELT.
I WAS WRITING IN BETWEEN 

02:40:32.974 --> 02:40:34.974
TEACHING.
I WAS WRITING WHEN I WAS 

02:40:35.211 --> 02:40:37.882
SUPPOSED TO BE GRADING.
I WAS DOING THIS PROJECT THAT I 

02:40:37.883 --> 02:40:39.933
HAD NO IDEA IF IT HAD AN 
AUDIENCE.

02:40:41.788 --> 02:40:43.788
I DID NOT KNOW WHO WOULD READ 
IT.

02:40:44.071 --> 02:40:45.266
I DIDN'T KNOW IF THE INDUSTRY 
WAS ABLE TO HANDLE SOMETHING 

02:40:45.267 --> 02:40:47.935
THAT WAS SO DAMN DOMINICAN AND 

02:40:51.006 --> 02:40:53.006
SO AFRO-DOMINICAN AND SO NEW 
YORK.

02:40:53.038 --> 02:40:55.038
I KNEW I WANTED TO READ IT BUT I
DIDN'T KNOW IF THERE WAS A 

02:40:56.090 --> 02:40:58.338
READER SHIP FOR THIS THING THAT 
I WORKED ON FOR YEARS AND THEN 

02:41:02.489 --> 02:41:04.514
IN 2014, WALTER DEAN MYERS' 
SEMINAL OP ED, WHERE ARE THE 

02:41:04.515 --> 02:41:07.439
PEOPLE OF COLOR IN CHILDREN'S 
BOOKS WAS PUBLISHED AND I READ 

02:41:07.440 --> 02:41:12.329
THAT AND I KEPT MY EYE OUT AND I
THOUGHT:  OH, WAIT, WAIT.

02:41:14.167 --> 02:41:15.816
I THINK SOMETHING MIGHT CHANGE 
AND THEN "WE NEED DIVERSE BOOKS"

02:41:15.817 --> 02:41:20.554
WAS FOUNDED AND I USED MY LITTLE
MFA MONEY WHAT WAS LEFT OF IT 

02:41:20.555 --> 02:41:23.397
AND DONATED NOT BECAUSE I WANTED
TO BE AT THE FRONT OF THE LINE 

02:41:23.398 --> 02:41:26.486
BUT BECAUSE I KNEW:  THIS IS A 
GAME-CHANGER.

02:41:27.725 --> 02:41:29.960
THIS IS A GAME-CHANGER.
EVERYONE SEES WHAT I SAW IN MY 

02:41:29.961 --> 02:41:31.802
CLASSROOM.
WE NEED TO BRING THESE BOOKS 

02:41:31.803 --> 02:41:33.856
FORWARD.
WE NEED TO BRING THESE BOOKS 

02:41:33.857 --> 02:41:37.517
FORTH AND SO I'M SO HONORED THAT
IT'S THIS AWARD THAT I AM 

02:41:38.393 --> 02:41:40.393
RECEIVING TODAY.
THAT IT'S ALL OF THESE 

02:41:41.064 --> 02:41:43.064
CONNECTIONS THAT BRING ME INTO 
THIS ROOM.

02:41:44.579 --> 02:41:46.670
I WAS EMBOLDENED TO KEEP WRITING
BECAUSE I KNEW I WAS NO LONGER 

02:41:46.671 --> 02:41:49.599
ALONE.
I KNEW THAT THE STORY I WAS 

02:41:51.431 --> 02:41:53.431
WRITING HAD A HOME.
RIGHT?

02:41:53.679 --> 02:41:55.511
IT FELT LIKE A BATTLE CRY OF 
FOLKS THAT WERE RATTLING THE 

02:41:55.512 --> 02:41:57.512
CAGES AND DEMANDING TO BE LET 
IN.

02:41:59.178 --> 02:42:01.218
IT WAS A VIVID REMINDER ON A 
DAILY BASIS THAT THERE WAS NOT 

02:42:01.219 --> 02:42:03.219
ONLY ROOM FOR ME AND MY STORIES 

02:42:06.528 --> 02:42:08.528
IN PUBLICKING, PUBLISHING BUT 
THERE WAS A 

02:42:08.589 --> 02:42:09.794
NEED FOR THE KIND OF STORIES I 
WANTED TO TELL AND FOR WHO I 

02:42:09.795 --> 02:42:11.795
WANTED TO TELL THEM TO.

02:42:15.096 --> 02:42:17.096
THE POET, ESSAYIST AND MUSIC 

02:42:18.961 --> 02:42:20.961
CRITIC RAKEEB HAS A QUOTE 
APARTMENT CHANCE THE RAPPER.

02:42:22.426 --> 02:42:24.426
EVERY TIME I RAID IT IT MAKES MY
SPINE THRUM.

02:42:26.127 --> 02:42:26.958
WHEN I FIRST READ IT HE WAS 
CONSIDERING HIP HOP AND IT'S A 

02:42:26.959 --> 02:42:31.272
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I
APPLY IT TO BUT HE WROTE -- HE, 

02:42:31.273 --> 02:42:35.578
MEANING CHANCE THE RAPPER, MAKES
MUSIC FACING HIS PEOPLE, WHILE 

02:42:35.579 --> 02:42:38.915
ALSO LEAVING THE DOOR OPEN FOR 
EVERYONE ELSE TO TRY TO WORK 

02:42:38.916 --> 02:42:44.068
THEIR WAY IN.
IT WAS THIS KIND OF THINKING, 

02:42:44.069 --> 02:42:48.207
THIS INTENSE FOCUS ON NOT 
TRANSLATING MYSELF, ON NOT 

02:42:51.300 --> 02:42:53.370
ITALICIZING OR OTHERING MYSELF, 
OR NOT USING KID GLOVES WITH MY 

02:42:53.371 --> 02:42:55.561
AUDIENCE AND TRUSTING THEY WOULD
DO THE WORK.

02:42:56.792 --> 02:42:58.202
IT WAS THAT KIND OF THINKING 
THAT LED ME TO WRITE SOMETHING 

02:42:58.203 --> 02:43:02.325
THAT FELT INCREDIBLY HONEST.
EVEN AT A TIME WHEN I HAD NO 

02:43:02.326 --> 02:43:05.814
IDEA WHO WOULD READ IT.
I DIDN'T KNOW IF ANY PUBLISHER 

02:43:05.815 --> 02:43:08.722
WOULD WANT IT.
IT SEEMS INCREDIBLY SPECIAL THAT

02:43:11.866 --> 02:43:13.902
THE EDITOR WHO ENDED UP PICKING 
THIS BOOK, WHO ENDED UP USHERING

02:43:17.378 --> 02:43:19.378
ME THROUGH MY DEBUT, WAS 

02:43:20.850 --> 02:43:22.912
ROSEMARY BROSNAN, THE EDITOR FOR
MANY YEARS OF WALTER DEAN MYERS.

02:43:23.119 --> 02:43:27.006
IT FEELS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT 
THAT SHE WAS THE PERSON WHO DID 

02:43:27.007 --> 02:43:31.896
THIS WORK WITH ME, WHO WAS THE 
FIRST EDITOR TO REPLY TO MY 

02:43:34.005 --> 02:43:35.650
AGENT AND SAY:  YES, YES, THIS 
BOOK, RIGHT?

02:43:35.651 --> 02:43:37.336
SHE WAS TELLING ME JUST 
YESTERDAY WE WERE TEXTING SHE 

02:43:37.337 --> 02:43:39.860
WAS LIKE I WAS SO IN AWE OF 
WALTER.

02:43:41.496 --> 02:43:43.527
I LEARNED SO MUCH FROM HIM.
AND I LIKE TO THINK THAT MAYBE 

02:43:43.528 --> 02:43:48.895
WALTER LEARNED SOME FROM HER AND
THAT AAM THE BENEFICIARY OF ALL 

02:43:48.896 --> 02:43:51.974
THAT LEARNING, THANK GOODNESS, 
RIGHT?

02:43:52.778 --> 02:43:54.648
SOMEBODY DID THAT WORK.
ROSEMARY IS NOT ABLE TO BE HERE 

02:43:54.649 --> 02:43:57.134
TODAY BUT I WANTED TO MAKE SURE 
I BROUGHT HER INTO THE ROOM, 

02:43:57.135 --> 02:43:59.995
THAT I SAID HER NAME HERE 
BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF FOLKS 

02:43:59.996 --> 02:44:01.996
WHO WANT TO JUMP ON TRENDS 
SOMETIMES.

02:44:03.668 --> 02:44:05.668
THERE WERE EDITORS I SPOKE TO 

02:44:06.737 --> 02:44:08.145
THAT SAID THINGS OH, I LOVE THE 
LATINX FLAVOR AS IF THIS WAS A 

02:44:08.146 --> 02:44:12.415
SEASONING THAT I SPRINKLED ON A 
NOVEL AND NOT WHO I AM OR WHAT 

02:44:12.416 --> 02:44:15.305
I'M WRITING AND ROSEMARY WAS NOT
THAT PERSON.

02:44:16.755 --> 02:44:18.755
SHE'S SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN DOING
THE WORK AND I THINK IT'S 

02:44:19.194 --> 02:44:21.234
IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THOSE 
FOLKS THAT THIS AWARD IS NOT 

02:44:21.235 --> 02:44:24.079
MINE ALONE.
THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN CHUMP 

02:44:24.080 --> 02:44:28.001
YUNING DIVERSITY FOR YEARS HAVE 
BEEN HERE AND WE HAVE TO SAY 

02:44:28.002 --> 02:44:30.002
THEIR NAME AND REMIND OURSELVES 
THEY'RE HERE.

02:44:31.881 --> 02:44:33.881
I DO FEEL LIKE TODAY IS AN 
ARRIVAL OF SORTS.

02:44:34.337 --> 02:44:36.207
LIKE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T 
KNOW THEY WERE GUIDING MY STEPS 

02:44:36.208 --> 02:44:38.456
ARE FINALLY IN THE ROOM FOR ME 
TO THANK THEM.

02:44:39.713 --> 02:44:42.390
AS SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES THE 
ANCESTORS WALK WITH US, I HOPE 

02:44:42.391 --> 02:44:45.071
THAT MR. WALTER DEAN MYERS IS IN
THE ROOM TODAY.

02:44:47.310 --> 02:44:49.310
I HOPE HE KNOWS THE WORK WE ARE 
DOING IN HIS NAME.

02:44:50.192 --> 02:44:52.192
I HOPE HE FEELS THAT I'M WRITING

02:44:53.271 --> 02:44:56.161
IN HIS LINEAGE, THAT I CHOOSE TO
SENSOR CHARACTERS AND STORIES 

02:44:56.162 --> 02:44:59.659
THAT ARE VERY RARELY CENTERED.
I CHOOSE TO READ ABOUT 

02:45:01.083 --> 02:45:03.125
CHARACTERS OF COLOR WITH 
TENDERNESS AND LOVE AND A 

02:45:04.359 --> 02:45:07.245
PRECISION OF LANGUAGE AND A 
RIGOR OF IDEAS THAT W DE.

02:45:09.343 --> 02:45:11.391
THAT I LEARNED A BOOK COULD LOVE
ME BACK BY READING BOOKS LIKE 

02:45:11.392 --> 02:45:13.637
HIS.
THAT I HOPE I DO THAT EVERY 

02:45:15.700 --> 02:45:17.520
SINGLE TIME I WRITE MY OWN 
STORY.

02:45:17.521 --> 02:45:19.521
I DON'T SUBSCRIBE TO THE IDEA 
THAT WRITING IS THERAPY.

02:45:20.790 --> 02:45:23.038
I BELIEVE THERAPY IS THERAPY.
[ LAUGHTER ]

02:45:24.869 --> 02:45:26.869
I DO HOWEVER BELIEVE THAT THE 

02:45:28.140 --> 02:45:30.983
POWER OF WRITING LOVE ONTO THE 
PAGE AND FEEDING THAT IN THE 

02:45:30.984 --> 02:45:34.667
DIRECTION OF AN AUDIENCE EVEN IF
IT'S JUST AN AUDIENCE OF ONE, 

02:45:34.668 --> 02:45:39.372
YOURSELF, IS PIVOTAL.
I DO BELIEVE WHAT MR. MYERS ONCE

02:45:39.373 --> 02:45:43.429
SAID:  I WRITE BOOKS FOR THE 
TROUBLED BOY I ONCE WAS AND FOR 

02:45:43.430 --> 02:45:45.430
THE BOY WHO LIVES WITHIN ME 
STILL.

02:45:46.978 --> 02:45:48.578
IT'S WHAT I DO.
AND SO WHILE I DON'T BELIEVE 

02:45:48.579 --> 02:45:51.483
THAT WRITING IS THERAPY, I DO 
BELIEVE THAT WRITING CAN BE 

02:45:53.101 --> 02:45:54.933
HEALING, AND IT'S OFTEN AS 
HEALING FOR THE WRITER AS IT IS 

02:45:54.934 --> 02:45:57.650
FOR THE READER.
I HOPE TO KEEP WRITING FOR 

02:45:59.524 --> 02:46:01.352
MYSELF, FOR MY COMMUNITY, FOR MY
FORMER AND FUTURE STUDENTS, FOR 

02:46:01.353 --> 02:46:03.839
ALL MY BELOVEDS.
I HOPE TO WRITE THEM ON THE 

02:46:03.840 --> 02:46:06.307
PAGE.
I WANT TO BUILD A PANTHEON OF 

02:46:06.308 --> 02:46:09.792
CHARACTERS AS RICH AND NUANCED 
AS THE PEOPLE I COME FROM.

02:46:11.863 --> 02:46:13.299
AND I DON'T WANT TO SEE -- AND 
WHILE I DON'T SEE AWARDS AND 

02:46:13.300 --> 02:46:16.996
STICKERS AS THE END ALL-BE ALL, 
I DO SEE THEM AS A KIND OF 

02:46:17.998 --> 02:46:19.998
PERMISSION.

02:46:22.099 --> 02:46:23.942
A KIND OF CHEERLEADING, AS IF 
FOLKS FROM DIFFERENT WALKS OF 

02:46:23.943 --> 02:46:27.395
LIFE LOOK AT MY LEGACY OF 
LETTERS, AT THIS THING THAT I AM

02:46:31.334 --> 02:46:33.334
BUILDING, AND ARE SAYING IN 
GILDED CRIES -- 

02:46:37.843 --> 02:46:39.490
[ SPEAKING LANGUAGE OTHER THAN 
ENGLISH ]

02:46:39.491 --> 02:46:41.317
BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO TELLING
OUR STORIES THE ONLY DIRECTION 

02:46:41.318 --> 02:46:44.387
TO KEEP OUR EYES IS ONWARD.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS 

02:46:44.388 --> 02:46:45.846
AWARD.
THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE, AND 

02:46:45.847 --> 02:46:50.780
THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

02:47:19.777 --> 02:47:21.777
] ]   OKAY, FOLLOWING CHRIS, 

02:47:23.057 --> 02:47:25.134
LINDA SAW, JEWELL, AND LIZ, AND 
THE SYMPOSIUM EARLIER IS A 

02:47:26.372 --> 02:47:28.234
SET-UP FOR FAILURE.
LET'S JUST SAY THAT.

02:47:28.235 --> 02:47:30.235
OKAY.
HAVING GOTTEN THAT OUT, I'M 

02:47:32.913 --> 02:47:34.345
GOING TO BE EVEN A MOOD-KILLER 
FURTHER TO SAY, I'M GOING TO 

02:47:34.346 --> 02:47:36.598
TELL YOU A FEW RULES.
[ LAUGHTER ]

02:47:39.066 --> 02:47:41.144
BUT AT THIS POINT, I JUST WANT 
TO SAY, REPEAT ONE THING THAT 

02:47:41.145 --> 02:47:43.428
CHRIS SAID, THAT REALLY MEANS A 
LOT.

02:47:45.466 --> 02:47:47.891
EVERYTHING YOU SAID MEANS A LOT.
BUT WE ARE GOING PLACES AS A 

02:47:47.892 --> 02:47:49.925
FAMILY.
I THINK WE NEED TO KEEP THAT IN 

02:47:49.926 --> 02:47:57.063
MIND, BECAUSE WE ARE A FAMILY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

02:48:01.147 --> 02:48:03.185
OKAY, SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE
AUTHORS AND THE JUDGES PLEASE 

02:48:08.526 --> 02:48:10.372
STAY HEAR FOR HERE FOR SOME 
PHOTOS AND 

02:48:10.373 --> 02:48:13.256
WE'LL HAVE THE AUTHORS GO INTO 
THE WHITTALL PAVILION FOR 

02:48:15.491 --> 02:48:17.165
BOOK-SANING SO ONE FAVOR THAT 
WE'RE ASKING BECAUSE THERE ARE 

02:48:17.166 --> 02:48:20.449
STUDENTS IN THE ROOM AND I KNOW 
THAT THEY ARE DYING TO GET BACK 

02:48:20.450 --> 02:48:23.769
TO THEIR SCHOOLS FOR WORK --
[ LAUGHTER ]

02:48:25.182 --> 02:48:27.182
THAT WE LET THEM GO TO THE HEAD 
OF THE LINE, IF THEY HAVE 

02:48:28.700 --> 02:48:30.700
PURCHASED A BOOK AND NEED A BOOK
SIGNED.

02:48:32.375 --> 02:48:34.847
AND ONE OTHER QUESTION -- ONE 
THING TO ASK IS, IF YOU DON'T 

02:48:34.848 --> 02:48:36.875
MIND, WE DON'T REALLY HAVE TIME 

02:48:39.934 --> 02:48:41.547
FOR INDIVIDUAL PHOTOS AND A LOT 
OF PERSONALIZATION, SO IT REALLY

02:48:41.548 --> 02:48:46.924
IS JUST A BOOK-SIGNING, WITH 
EXCEPTIONS, I'M SURE.

02:48:49.761 --> 02:48:51.415
SO THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR 
COMING.

02:48:51.416 --> 02:48:53.416
THANK YOU TO THE LIBRARY OF 
CONGRESS.

02:48:55.742 --> 02:48:57.742

IS SO HAPPY TO PARTNER THE 

02:48:59.216 --> 02:49:01.139
SYMPOSIUM AND THE AWARDS 
CEREMONY MEANS SO MUCH TO ALL OF

02:49:01.140 --> 02:49:03.140
