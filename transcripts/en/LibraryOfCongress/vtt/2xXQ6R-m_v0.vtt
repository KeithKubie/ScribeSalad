00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:20.390
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.740
We have a very special
graphic artist and illustrator

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.740
by the name of Jarrett Krosoczka.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.510
I almost got it.

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.540
[ Applause ]

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.920
And many of you know who he is.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.100
And you've seen books.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.400
And so I'm going to turn the
show immediately over to him.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.700
Jarrett.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.000
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.300
Thank you.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.600
Hi everybody.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.900
How are you?

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.200
&gt;&gt; Good.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.500
&gt;&gt; Good. Well, my name's Jarrett,

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.830
and I'm an author and
I'm an illustrator.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.510
So that means that, as the
author, I write the words.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.380
And as the illustrator,
I draw the pictures.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.520
And I feel very lucky
that I can do both jobs.

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.390
I get to envision the entire
story because the story's told

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.550
with words and with pictures.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.090
And I feel very fortunate
that my books get published

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.370
because that means copies of
my books may get to schools

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.800
and libraries and bookstores
all across the country.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.360
And I get to meet people
I've never met before,

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.910 position:56%
who've seen some of my books before.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.130
And it's a thrill to know
that these ideas that came

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.450
from my imagination
are getting shared

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.740
with young readers like yourselves.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.810
So I'm going to talk to you about
how I got my start, and for me,

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.040
it all began when I was a kid.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.000
Just like you because,
see, I've been artist

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.550
for as long as I can remember.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.850
I don't remember a time in my life
in which I didn't draw pictures.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.670
So this is a self-portrait that
I drew when I was in preschool.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.170
And I drew this picture
with crayons.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.940
Now how many people here have
ever drawn with a crayon before?

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.480
Well see, we all started
in the same place.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.780
We all started by drawing
with crayons.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.580
This is the first book
that I ever wrote.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.180
And I wrote this book when
I was in the third grade.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.040 position:56%
And I remember being a third grader.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.180
And I remember being in class.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.150
And I remember the teacher
presenting this project to us,

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.300
where we were going
to write our own book.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.990
We were studying Greek mythology,

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.680
and we had to write
our own Greek myth.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.530
And we were going to
write a news story.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.830
And we're going to illustrate it.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.000
And we're going to put
it together as a book.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.180
And this is that book that I
made when I was in third grade.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.190
So this is where my
career as an author began.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.470
Because an author is
somebody who writes a story.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.590
And it doesn't matter if you're
a kid, or if you're a grownup.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.480
It doesn't matter if that
book gets published and a lot

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.080
of people get to read it.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.190
Or if you make just one copy of the
book and just one friend reads it.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.710
What matters is that
you write the story.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.320
So how many of you here have
ever written a story before?

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.620
Raise your hand, if you ever --

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.920
well, then you guys
are all authors, too.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.750
I hope you realize that.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.060
You guys are all authors as well.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.840
Because I was an author when I
was a kid, and there's the proof.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.510
My book had a cover.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.350 position:56%
When you open up the book, the first
page you saw was the title page.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.360
And then came the story.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.030
And it was a story that was
told using words and pictures.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.970 position:56%
And this is exactly what I do for my
job today, now that I'm a grownup.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.520
I tell stories with
words and pictures.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.980
And words and pictures
are teammates.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.280
Now they work together.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.070
And one isn't in charge
of the other.

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.700
One's not the boss of the other.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.850
Words will tell one
part of the story.

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.670
And the pictures, they'll support
that, but then they'll offer

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.940
up another aspect of the story that
the words are not communicating.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.250
And sometimes they
make work on their own.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.770
So maybe the words will work
on their own to tell the story.

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.340
Maybe the pictures will work
alone to tell the story.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:01.730
And the very last page of the book
was the about the author page.

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.870
And my about the author
page, when I was a kid, read,

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.660
Jarrett lives in Worcester,
Massachusetts.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.150
He goes to Gates Lane School.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.150
He liked making this book.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.700
And I love to read
that last sentence.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.000
He liked making this book.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.940
I liked making that book because
I loved using my imagination.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.280
And that's what writing is.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.000
Writing is using your
imagination but on paper.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.870
And I loved using my imagination.

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.460
I loved writing so much
that I wouldn't wait

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.390
for this to be a school project.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.380
Because when I was young, I
would come home from school

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.720
and when I was done with anything
else that needed to be done.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.110
Any homework or chores.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.560
I would take out pieces of paper.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.940
I would fold them in half.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.240
And I would staple them together.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.620
And I would make my own books.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.300
For no other reason but for the
fact that I loved to be creative.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.190
So here are characters
that I would write books

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.200
for when I was in the fourth grade.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.230
And I wrote these books
after school on my own.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.400
There was no teacher
giving me an assignment.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.890
There was no grownup at home
saying it's time to make a book.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.910
I did it on my own.

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.160 position:56%
So there was an egg and a tomato
and a head of lettuce and a pumpkin.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.460
And they were friends.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:11.760
And they went to this
haunted house in one

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.180
of the books I wrote
[inaudible] in this haunted house,

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.520
there were all sorts of dangers.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.060 position:56%
There was en evil blender [laughter]
that wanted to chop them up.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.580
There was an evil toaster
[laughter].

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:28.320
And there was an evil microwave
that wanted to melt them up.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.620
I would make my own books.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.100
I'd also make my own comments.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.600
And this was another way for me
to creative, another way for me

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.360
to tell stories using
words and pictures.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.960
Here's a comic that I made
when I was in the fifth grade.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.190
Here's another comic that I made
when I was in middle school.

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:50.560
When I got older, when I got to
high school, I continued to draw.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.610
And I took a lot of art
classes in high school.

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.260
And in those high school
art classes,

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.870 position:56%
we had to draw a lot of still lifes.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.510
Have you guys ever drawn a
still life in art class before?

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:01.810
It's when -- yeah.

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.710
It's when you take an
object, or a group of objects,

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.290
and you set it on the table.

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:06.590
And you take out your pad of paper.

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.000
And you look at what
you see in front

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.660
of you, and you try to draw it.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.880
And it helps you learn
how to draw better.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.400
Well one day, my art teacher
asked us to draw a paper bag.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.670
He said, here's your
homework assignment.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.570
Just go home, get a paper bag.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:24.750
Set it up in any way you
want to set it up and draw

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.050
that book -- draw that picture.

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.580
So I took my paper bag
and I cut a face into it.

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.940
I set the paper bag up on the
table, and I drew this picture.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.030
Now, this is the picture
I drew as a teenager.

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:38.520
But many years later,
I would go on to write

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:43.300
and illustrate a book called
Baghead that would be published.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.780
So when I was drawing this picture,

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.690
I didn't know that I would
someday write that book.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.650
So there's no telling what's
going to happen in the future.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:53.690
There's no way of knowing how the
work that you're making right now

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:57.350
in your life may inspire
you in the future.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.620
So these characters
that you're drawing now,

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.120
maybe you'll find these
papers again in 20 years,

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.640 position:56%
and you'll start drawing them again.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.470
And sending them out
on new adventures.

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:09.650
When I was a teenager, I
got to be the cartoonist

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:11.410
for the high school newspaper.

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:12.900
That was really exciting
because I could come

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.800
up with these jokes
and these stories.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.690
They'd be printed in the newspaper.

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:17.990
So kids at my high school

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.760
that I didn't even know
were reading my stories.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.820
And that was such a thrill
for me, and it made me realize

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.470
that this is what I
wanted to do with my life.

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:28.680
I wanted to share my
stories with people.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.850
I wanted to have my work published.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.570
So even when I was a
senior in high school,

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:36.060
I was still drawing characters
and thinking about books.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.940
So I went to college to study art.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:42.320
I went to Rhode Island School
of Design to study illustration.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.520
Now before I could get into taking
illustration classes and learning

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.110
about drawing characters for books,
I had to take these classes --

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:51.780
they're called foundation classes.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.490
So you're learning
about color and design.

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:56.750
How one color can affect
another color.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:00.350
How some colors are warm
and some colors are cold.

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:03.960
And how some colors can evoke
different emotions in a viewer.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.460
I had to take drawing classes,

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:09.840
where we were learning
about light and shadow.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.440 position:56%
We were drawing still lifes to learn
about perspective in architecture.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.480
I had to take painting classes,
where we had to paint still lifes.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.030
We had to paint the models
that would come in and pose.

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:24.320
But just like when I was a kid,
whenever I had some free time,

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.810
I would write and illustrate
my own stories.

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:31.020
I always went back to
telling stories with my art.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:34.930
But those required classes
began to influence my work.

00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:37.390
And I started painting
my characters and soon,

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:40.140
I was painting my characters
all the time.

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:41.440
And when I was in college,

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.110
every single semester I took
a different writing course.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:48.810
Because as much as I wanted to
be a professional illustrator,

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:51.290
I also wanted to be a
professional author.

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:53.600
And I wanted to be the one
who would write the stories

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.520
for the books I would illustrate.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.080
So I took every single writing
course I could get my hands on.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.510
My most favorite writing
class out of any

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:06.840
of the writing classes I took was
a class called picture and word.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.650
And it was all about picture books.

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:11.260
Writing and illustrating
picture books.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.050
And the big project for
the semester was to write

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:17.020
and illustrate our own book.

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:18.420 position:56%
And I wrote this book in that class.

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.910
It was called Hello Said the Slug.

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:25.740
A story about this orange slug who
wants to be friends with this kid,

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:30.140
and that kid has no patience
for that giant-talking slug.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:33.630
I was really excited about
how this book turned out.

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.800
So much so that when the class was
over, I had this book and I thought

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.100
to myself well my teachers
liked the book.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.320
My classmates like the book.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.440
Maybe somebody at a
publisher would like the book.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:48.370 position:56%
And if somebody at a publisher liked
the book, they would publish it.

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:50.670
And they would make all of
these copies of the book

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:55.260
that would get sent out to schools
and libraries and bookstores.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.560
And everybody could read my book.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.380
And that would be so exciting.

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:02.240
So I mailed my book
out to a publisher,

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.540
and I waited.

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:06.610
And I waited some more.

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:08.750
And I waited some more after that.

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:10.780
But they eventually got back to me.

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:12.080
And guess what happened?

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.840
Did they like my book
and publish it?

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.140
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:16.640
&gt;&gt; No. They didn't [laughter].

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.540
No. They didn't like my book.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.980
They rejected the book.

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.460
That means they mailed
the book back to me.

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:26.990
They wrote me a letter explaining
why they didn't like the book.

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:29.770
But I was lucky they took
the time to explain why.

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:32.420
Bottom line is they said
we're not interested.

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:34.970
So did I give up because
I had one rejection?

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:36.270
&gt;&gt; No.

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:39.650
&gt;&gt; No. Because I mailed that
book out to a second publisher.

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:43.100
And then that second
publisher, they wrote me back.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.280
And did they like the
book and publish it?

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.380
&gt;&gt; Yeah. No.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:48.680
&gt;&gt; No [laughter].

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:49.980
No. They too rejected the book.

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:52.120
But I mailed the book
out to a third publisher,

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.630
and did they like the book?

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:55.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah. No.

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:56.610
&gt;&gt; No [laughter].

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:59.080
They too turned the story away.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.800
But I kept trying, and I mailed
the book out to a fourth publisher.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.100
And then a fifth.

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:05.400
And a sixth.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.700
And a seventh.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:08.000
And an eighth.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.300
And a ninth.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:10.600
And a tenth publisher.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.530
But they all had the same reaction.

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:13.830
They all said no, we're sorry.

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:15.130
We don't like your book.

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:16.460
We don't want to publish it.

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:18.940
But I didn't give up
and I didn't quit.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:21.810
And I mailed the book out
to an eleventh publisher,

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:23.970
and guess what happened?

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:27.190
Did they like the book
and publish it?

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:28.490
&gt;&gt; Yeah. No.

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:31.230
&gt;&gt; They did not like
the book [laughter].

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:32.770 position:56%
And they did not want to publish it.

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:37.320
So there I was with this book
that I loved and I believed in,

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.740
but none of the publishers
were interested.

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.400
So I kept writing.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.840
And I wrote another story.

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:47.000
I wrote a story called
Josh Had a Bad Haircut.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.740
A story about a boy named Josh

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:50.500
who gets this terribly
embarrassing haircut.

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:55.870
I mailed this book
out to a publisher.

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:57.170
And did they like this new book?

00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:58.470
&gt;&gt; No.

00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:59.770
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:01.070
&gt;&gt; No. They didn't [laughter].

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:03.090
Thanks for that vote of
confidence down there, but no.

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:08.110
Every publisher that saw
this book rejected the book.

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:13.780
But in one moment of the story,
on one page of the book, the boy,

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:17.570
he wears a paper bag on his
head to hide the bad haircut.

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:22.430
And that one image was you know
inspired by that picture I drew

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:24.970
as a teenager but would
later inspire me

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:27.100
to write that book Baghead.

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:28.400
That would get published.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.800
This one scene would
later be expanded

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.280
to be the whole basis
for this book Baghead.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:38.220
But all of the books I had written,
though, were all getting rejected.

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.510
And so I began to think
it's just my writing.

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:45.840 position:56%
These publishers don't like my
stories, but maybe they like my art.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.640
And if they like my
art, they would hire me

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.650
to illustrate a book
that somebody wrote.

00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:54.910
And I thought maybe that's just
how I get my foot in the door.

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:56.890
By drawing pictures for
other authors' books.

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:59.330
So what I would do is [inaudible]
paint a picture like this.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:02.670
And I would take that picture
-- I'd put it on a postcard.

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:04.570
That postcard would have my art.

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:07.090
My name. And my phone number.

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:08.390
And my e-mail.

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:09.690
My website.

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:11.470
Like information for
carrier pigeons.

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:15.340
Anyway that they wanted to
get a hold of me to hire me

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:18.480
to illustrate a book, they
could get a hold of me.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.820
I printed up 80 of these postcards.

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:26.640
Printed 80 postcards, out to
80 different people at all

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.660
of these different publishers.

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:32.650
And how many of those 80
people got in touch with me?

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:33.950
&gt;&gt; One.

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:35.250
&gt;&gt; Well, one is a good
guess, but no.

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:36.550
Fewer than that.

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:37.850
Zero [laughter].

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:39.390
Yeah. Nobody did.

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:40.790
So I painted another picture.

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:44.020
The next week I printed
up another 80 postcards.

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.690
And how many people
got in touch with me?

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:46.990
&gt;&gt; Zero.

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:50.470
&gt;&gt; None. And so week after
week and month after month,

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:55.250
I mailed out these postcards,
and I wouldn't hear from anybody.

00:13:55.250 --> 00:14:00.930
And it got to the point where
I had been sending my books

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:03.450
out to publishers for two years.

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:07.060
Two years of sending my books
out and getting them rejected.

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:11.250
But I kept writing because
that's what I love to do.

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:14.230
And I wrote a book around that
time called Good Night, Monkey Boy.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:15.530
About a boy.

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:16.830
He wears monkey pajamas.

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:18.130
He doesn't want to go to bed.

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:20.540 position:56%
And then I painted this illustration

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:23.550
and I put this illustration
on a postcard.

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:25.710
I printed up 80 postcards.

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:28.180
I mailed them out to 80
different people at all

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:30.470
of these different publishers.

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:34.160
And of the 80 people who
received these postcards,

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.430
how many of those 80
people got in touch with me?

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:38.590
&gt;&gt; Zero.

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:41.550
&gt;&gt; One person did.

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:46.430
I received an e-mail from an editor
at Random House Children's Books.

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:47.940
And that's a big publisher.

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:49.750
And I couldn't believe it.

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:52.640
And to give you a perspective
of how long ago this was.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:53.940
From the time that I turned

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:55.660
on my computer till I
could download the e-mail,

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:57.430
it took me 20 minutes [laughter]

00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:59.710
because that's what life
was like in the late '90s.

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:02.310
You had to connect to a phone line.

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:04.430
There was an awful sound.

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:08.430
But 20 minutes later, after turning
on the computer, I got this e-mail

00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:10.700
from somebody at Random House.

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:12.840
And the subject of the
e-mail said nice work.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.880
And I couldn't believe it.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.080
And in this e-mail,
this editor wrote

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:19.560
that she had received my postcard.

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:23.390
And it prompted her to visit my
website, and she liked my artwork.

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:26.340
And she said, if you're ever in
New York City, please let me know.

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:29.980
We'd love to meet you and
see some more of your work.

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:32.300
So do you guys suppose that
I happened to be in New York

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:33.600
that next week [laughter]?

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.790
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I called her the next
day to say I'm going to be

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:38.090
in New York that next week.

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:39.390
And we set up a meeting.

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:41.380
And I went into New
York with my portfolio.

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:43.400
And I showed this editor
all of my artwork,

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.990
and I showed her all
of my book ideas.

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:48.140
And I left New York
with an agreement

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:50.590
to have my very first
book published.

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:52.590 position:56%
So Good Night, Monkey Boy was a book

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:56.300
that I only had started
writing a couple weeks,

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:57.880
really, before that meeting.

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.560
But because I kept
coming up with new ideas.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:03.100
I kept challenging
myself creatively.

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.030
I kept sending my work out.

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:08.420
That is how my first
book was published.

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:10.960
So I kept writing picture books.

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.000
And the books that my
publisher liked, they published.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.300
Like Baghead.

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:16.600
And Punk Farm.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:17.900
And My Buddy, Slug.

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:19.200
And Ollie, the Purple Elephant.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.840
I have a collection
of picture books.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.470
And I also have a graphic
novel series

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:27.300 position:56%
about a lunch lady who fights crime.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.890
So the very first book
was called Lunch Lady

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:33.920
and the Cyborg Substitute, and it
was followed up by nine other books

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.220
for a total of 10 books
in the series.

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:40.960
The most recent book is Lunch
Lady and the Schoolwide Scuffle.

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.260
And I'm going to tell you now.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:43.770
I'm going to shift gears.

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:47.180 position:56%
And now that I've told you about how
I got published, I'm going to talk

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:49.920
to you about how I got
the idea for the series.

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:53.740
And what I did with those ideas
to turn them from just a few notes

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:56.620
in my sketchbook to
be a book series.

00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:00.760
What happened was way back, when
my very first book was published.

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:03.800
I went back to my old elementary
school, Gates Lane School

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:07.950 position:56%
in Worcester, Massachusetts, to talk
to the students there about writing

00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:11.950
and illustrating and having
that first book published.

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:14.430
And they set me up
in the cafetorium.

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:16.600
You know what a cafetorium
is [inaudible]?

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:18.610
Yeah. Half cafeteria,
half auditorium,

00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:21.340
depending on what's going
on at school that day.

00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:23.420
And I had a slide projector.

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:25.380
You can ask your teachers --

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:27.690
maybe The Library of Congress has
one [inaudible] slide projector

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:30.990
looks like, so you could see what
this was like back in the day.

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:33.880
Way before iPads and
digital projection.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.630
And so I had a slide projector, and
I'm setting up my slide projector.

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:42.050
And I looked across the
cafetorium, and there she was.

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:44.520
My old lunch lady.

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:48.040
She was busy working and getting
lunches ready for school that day.

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.720
So I had to stop what I was doing.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.020
I went over to say hello.

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:52.840
And I said hi Jeannie, how are you?

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:55.830
You know, she looked at me, and
I could tell she recognized me.

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:57.130
The gears were turning.

00:17:57.130 --> 00:17:58.430
She was trying to place me.

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:00.750
And she looked at me, and
she said Stephen Krosoczka?

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:04.780
And I was amazed that she
knew I was a Krosoczka.

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:07.880
But Stephen is my uncle, who's 20
years older than I am [laughter].

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:12.120
And she had been his lunch
lady when he was a kid.

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:15.240
So she started telling me about
her grandkids, and it blew my mind.

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.940
I thought grandkids?

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:18.240
Wait a minute.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.540
You mean you leave the school
and have a life [laughter]?

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:22.160
I thought you lived in the kitchen.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:26.710
I had never thought about my lunch
lady's life outside of school.

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:31.390
And this chance encounter
inspired my imagination.

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:34.050
And I opened up my sketchbook
when I got home that day,

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:36.380
and I started drawing
this lunch lady character.

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:40.420
And I wrote a picture
book, not a graphic novel.

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:41.720
A picture book.

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.900
Remember my first picture
book had just been published.

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:46.960
I had just finished the art for
Baghead, which was my second book.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.260
Which was a picture book.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:52.560
So I thought lunch lady was meant
to be a picture book as well.

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.960
And it was a story about kids
who sat at their lunch table

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:59.350
and debated what they thought
their lunch lady did after school.

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:01.410
And whatever their
flights of fantasy were,

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:03.200
you would see that in the art.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.770
So if one kid said our lunch
lady's an opera singer.

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:08.780
And you would turn the page, and
you would see that in the art.

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:12.640
One of the students thought well,
maybe our lunch lady is a spy.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:13.940
And she knows karate.

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:15.870
And she keeps the school safe.

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:20.960
And that quickly became the
more interesting story to tell.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:27.330
The story of a lunch lady who is
actually secretly a super hero.

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:30.970
And she's like a spy
in the cafeteria.

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:32.800
But now that story
would no longer fit

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.360
into the format of a picture book.

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:38.110
A picture book is only
32 pages long.

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:40.770
And now that I'm dealing with a
story of heroes versus villains

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:44.420
and mysteries that would need to
be solved, I'd need a longer book.

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:46.130
And I wasn't sure what
kind of book it would be.

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:47.430
And that didn't matter.

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:48.750
What mattered was the story.

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:50.460
What mattered was the character,

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.680
and the characters that
would surround her.

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.310
So in my sketchbook, over
the next several years,

00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:56.730
I just kept drawing this character.

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:59.410
At one point I thought it was
supposed to be a chapter book.

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:00.710
That didn't

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:03.980
seem like the right fit either,
but I kept drawing the character,

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:06.010
thinking about how
she'd get around town.

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:07.310
How she'd go undercover.

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:10.300
I started thinking about who
the other characters were.

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:13.980
So she has an assistant named
Betty, who helps her fight crime.

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.980
She has these three meddling kids

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:18.100
that you know they
help her fight crime,

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:19.490
even though she doesn't
want them around.

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:21.660
She thinks they're
going to blow her cover.

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:23.760
But there's Hector,
Terrence and Dee.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.060
And they're the breakfast bunch,

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:27.300
and they become involved
in the mysteries.

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:31.220
And she uses items from the
cafeteria [laughter] disguised

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:33.000
as spy gadgets.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.480
So she has a spork phone.

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:36.780
She has a spatu-copter.

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:39.150
She has fish stick nun chucks.

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:41.560
Because see, if you saw your
lunch lady walking down the hall

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:43.620
with nun chucks, you
would tell your friend,

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:45.120
and that friend would
tell another friend.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.720
Those two friends -- and
then before you knew it,

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:51.110
the whole school would know that
your lunch lady is a crime fighter.

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:54.350
So she has to have her spy
gadgets disguised as things

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:55.650
that you would see
a lunch lady with.

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:56.950
Like fish sticks.

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:58.390
She has a milk camera
to spy on the classroom.

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:01.060
She has rubber glove suction
cups to climb the walls

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:02.360
with her yellow rubber gloves.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.200
She has a lunch tray laptop.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.850
Now it was around this time
that I was invited to be a part

00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:11.760
of this book called Guys Write
for Guys Reading [phonetic].

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.160
Which is edited by John Cheska.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:15.940
And he asked his author friends

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:20.480
to make a little contribution
to this anthology.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:23.800
Everyone would write a couple
of pages' worth of stuff.

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.830
And he wanted us to
connect ourselves

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:28.310
with our younger selves
to our current selves.

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:31.970
So I thought as an artist, I
would revisit some old artwork.

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:34.400
Now I'm very lucky that every year
my grandfather would give me a

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.700
storage bin.

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.300
He'd say save what you want.

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:38.860
And then we're going to
throw the rest of it --

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:40.690
clean your room and
throw things away.

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:44.100
So I was going through these bins,
and I found comics that I made

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.310
as an elementary school student.

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:49.570
I found comics that I made
as a middle school student.

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:51.260
And as a high school student.

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:53.950
I found comics that I
made as a college student.

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:56.410
But once my first picture
book was published,

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:59.470
I'd kind of stopped making comics.

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:02.800
So I found this comic that
I made in the fifth grade

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.060
about a character named
Lightning Man.

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:07.750
And I realized I didn't
finish his story.

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:11.060
So for Guys Write for Guys
Read, I continued his story.

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:15.560 position:56%
I completed his story and not only
was I redrawing a character I hadn't

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:20.870 position:56%
drawn in so many years, I remembered
what I loved about making comics.

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:22.500
And what you can do
with the storytelling.

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:23.800
And the action.

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.100
And the pacing.

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:26.400
And the humor.

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.700
With that visual storytelling
format.

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:30.390 position:56%
And I said well, this is perfect
for the story that I've been working

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:33.740
on for the past four and a
half years at that point.

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:35.560
Four and a half years of sketching.

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:37.110
A story about a crime
fighting lunch lady.

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:39.480
I sent these pages
off to my publisher.

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.000
They loved the idea.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.730
They wanted to publish the book.

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:45.620 position:56%
But they weren't sure how to because
they hadn't published graphic

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:46.920
novels then.

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:48.790
They didn't have any
graphic novels on their list

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:50.090
that they were publishing.

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:52.350
So they thought well, could we
print these books in full color?

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:55.600
And they realized they really
couldn't because it cost a lot

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.900
to print a book in full color.

00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:01.770 position:56%
And they didn't want to put a book
out to stores and libraries for $15.

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:04.170
So we thought what if these books
were printed in just black ink?

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:07.040
And they'd be printed in you
know just black and white.

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.670
And so the production
costs would be low,

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:11.070
so the retail cost would be low.

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:16.240
But the fear was there's no color
to really draw the reader in.

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:20.120
So ultimately, we decided to
print the book in just two inks.

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:22.050
Black ink and we would
choose a second color

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:24.590
that would become the
signature color for the series.

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:27.070
And we chose yellow
because that is the color

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:30.420
of the iconic dishwashing
rubber glove [laughter].

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:32.950
So now these books are going
to happen, I need to know how

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:35.660
to draw these characters, and
every time I draw the character,

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:38.570
it needs to look like
the same person.

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:41.970
So I draw the character over and
over and over and over again.

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:44.410
And I train myself
so every time I draw

00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:47.730
that character it looks
like the same person.

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:49.980
Then I set out to write the story.

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:53.020
Now I've done about five years
of brainstorming at this point.

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:56.100
And I like to spend more
time you know brainstorming.

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:57.400
Sketching out the characters.

00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:58.930 position:56%
Getting to know their personalities.

00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:01.810
Before I start worrying
too much about the plot.

00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:03.940
But when I start, I'm
ready for the plot.

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:06.580
I used this device
called a story mountain.

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:09.810
And it helps me -- as a visual
thinker and a visual learner,

00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:12.780
I like to see the whole
story mapped out.

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:14.850
And I think about the beginning.

00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:16.150
The rising action.

00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:17.450
And the climax.

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:18.750
And the falling action.

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:20.050
And the resolution of the story.

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:23.420
And it's important for me to point
out to you that when I start off

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:26.680
with this blank story
mountain, I don't start here.

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:30.910
I don't have to answer the question
of what happens in the beginning.

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:34.170
Because maybe the first idea
is the climax of the story.

00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:37.100
So I could jot that down first.

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:39.300
And I just keep coming up
with ideas and brainstorming

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:43.540
because I don't need to dream
up the story in the same order

00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:46.050
that my reader will
eventually read it.

00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:50.160
I dream up the story, and
I rearrange those elements

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:53.280
of the story how I see fit
to be revealed to the reader.

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.600
And I make page after
page of notes to myself

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.210
on what I want to happen
in the story.

00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:00.030
And I lay out the book.

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:03.880
So a 96-page graphic novel,
I make 96 little rectangles,

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:07.730
and I try to figure out what
event will happen on which page.

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:10.610
And you can see I'm
moving things around.

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:13.760
And I'm taking arrows and saying
no, this event should happen here.

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:16.420
This event should happen
earlier or later.

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:18.410
And every page starts
off looking like this.

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:23.630
This is a small thumbnail sketch
where I'm trying to figure

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:26.410
out where the panels are
going to go because I need

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:28.480
to recreate the reading experience.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:32.840
Like when you open up a book that
has text only, your eye goes where?

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:34.410
Your eye goes to the
top left of the page.

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:38.240
Right? And your eyes scan from left
to right, and then when you get

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:40.430
to the end of the sentence,
your eye goes back down

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:41.790
and you scan from left to right.

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:47.930 position:56%
So I have to, as the designer of the
graphic novel, design these panels

00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:50.660
to visually recreate
that experience.

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:53.940
So people just naturally know
where to send their eyes.

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:56.690 position:56%
And then when it comes to designing
the information within those panels,

00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:59.250
I have to do the same thing.

00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:02.120
So that people read
it from left to right.

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:06.170
So I make 96 pages'
worth of sketches.

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:08.740
I'll also write out a script.

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:11.420
A script is just what the
characters are saying,

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:12.720
descriptions of the actions.

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.020
My editor will read this.

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:15.570
She'll read the script.

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:17.320
She'll look at the sketches.

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:18.620
She'll think about it.

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:21.200
And she'll write me
an editorial letter,

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.520
stating this is what's
working [inaudible]

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:25.890
but this part here,
maybe not so much.

00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:28.880
So she's pushing me to
write a better book.

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:32.240
So I listen to her advice,
and I revise the story.

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:34.680
And I'll write a second draft.

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:36.260
And I'll make some changes.

00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:38.140
And she'll read that second draft.

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:41.970
And then maybe the third
draft, maybe a fourth, fifth.

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:43.660
Sometimes up to eight drafts.

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:47.010 position:56%
But when the story's in great shape,
I can start working on the artwork.

00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:48.430
And to create the artwork
for the books,

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:51.670
I start by just penciling
out the characters.

00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:55.190
And I use a special pencil
called non-photo blue.

00:26:55.190 --> 00:27:00.120 position:56%
It's the special shade of blue that
won't get recognized by the scanner.

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:04.690
Because what I do is I take out ink
and I dip my brush into the ink.

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:07.210
And I ink in the final line work.

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:10.460
And I scan that artwork
into black and white,

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:13.380
and the computer will only
see the black line work.

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:16.010
The computer won't see all
of those sketchy lines.

00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:17.810
Which is why you don't see
them in the finished books,

00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:20.710
but they're underneath
there in the finished art.

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:24.910
So I always start off by drawing
the major shapes of the character.

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:28.030
Every character is made
up of a series of shapes.

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:29.450
And I'm creating the gesture.

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:32.480
The gesture means what
is the character's pose?

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:36.510
And I'll add details on top of that
gesture, and I can make changes.

00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:39.520
So maybe her arm should go
in a different direction.

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:43.090
I'll then take out my ink, and
I'll dip my brush into the ink

00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:45.870
and draw the finished line work.

00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:49.530
And I draw with a brush because
you get a very dynamic line

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:51.000
when you draw with a brush.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.260
If you apply a lot of
pressure to that brush,

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:55.130 position:56%
that line is going to be very thick.

00:27:55.130 --> 00:28:00.920
As you lift the pressure away, that
line will go from thick to thin.

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:03.090
So as I finish each
piece of artwork,

00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:06.710
I collect on a bulletin board in
front of my desk so I can see all

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:09.750 position:56%
of the artwork and make sure all of
the characters are looking the same.

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:13.690
Make sure the environment that
they're in looks the same.

00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:17.670
And I take the artwork,
bring it over to my scanner,

00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:18.970
and scan it into my computer.

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:21.290
So now this artwork
that I created by hand,

00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:23.670
I can see on my computer screen.

00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:25.380
And you'll see that all of
the word balloons are empty.

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:27.000
I don't handwrite the words.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.660
I type them out.

00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:35.620
And once all of the
text is in place,

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:37.460
I'll select the different
shades of yellow,

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:41.270
and all of the yellow
will get plugged in.

00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:47.630
And then I tone down that black
ink to get shades of gray.

00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:51.450
So 96 computer files for
the 96 pages of the book.

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:53.430
I send those to the publisher
through the internet.

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:55.530
They print out just
one copy of the book.

00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:57.950
They're not going to print up
all the copies to distribute them

00:28:57.950 --> 00:29:00.200
to bookshelves just
yet because we want

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:02.460
to make sure there
are no mistakes here.

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:05.790
There's bound to be
a mistake or two.

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:08.620
So perhaps I've misspelled
a sound effect.

00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:10.510
Maybe there's something
weird about the art.

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:11.820
Maybe something is miscolored.

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:14.950
And we'll make notes to one
another on this one copy.

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:20.010
And I'll have one last
chance to open up Photoshop

00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:24.690
and make any changes, before these
files are released to the printer.

00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:26.410 position:56%
And they print up all of the copies.

00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:28.380
And this is the most exciting step.

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:31.440
This is the -- up until this point,
this has been thoughts and notes.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.250
I've yet to be able
to hold the book.

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:36.120
Hold the object and turn the pages

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:40.080
and watch the story unfold,
as I imagined it might.

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:43.800 position:56%
Now from that moment that I ran into
my old lunch lady and to the day

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:47.030
that I held this book in my
hands, eight years have passed.

00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:49.740
It was a number of
years of brainstorming.

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:51.930
To sticking with it.

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:54.590
Getting the artwork done
for that first book.

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:58.100
But like I said, now there
are 10 books all together.

00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:00.460
So ten 96-page

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:02.150
graphic novels.

00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:05.240
And this is what all of
the artwork looks like.

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:06.540
For all of the books.

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:10.050
I just recently moved, so I was
stacking up all of the artwork.

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:11.350
And I looked at it,
and I thought wow,

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:16.170
that represents a significant
percentage of my life.

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:21.080
I've been working on the
series now for 13 years now.

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:22.750
But it's been very
rewarding because I get

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:25.130
to meet young readers
who've read the books.

00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:26.430
Who know the characters.

00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:27.730
Who know the stories.

00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:29.430
And I get physical mail.

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:32.550
I get tweets from parents
and teachers of kids

00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:35.030
who are reading the books
in the printed form and kids

00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:36.870
who are reading them on tablets.

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:42.280
And I get wonderful letters
and drawings from kids.

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:43.830
And they're drawing the
way that I was drawing.

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:45.730
I learned how to draw
when I would draw my --

00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:47.770
I would draw Garfield,
or I would draw Snoopy.

00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:49.570
I'd draw some of my
favorite characters.

00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:52.550
[ Inaudible Response ]

00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:58.540 position:56%
And the American Library Association
invited me to design a read poster.

00:30:58.540 --> 00:30:59.840
So I designed this poster,

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:03.450
and I spot it at libraries,
as I travel the country.

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:06.130
A kid once trick-or-treated
at my house [laughter] dressed

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:09.310
as my character, which
was pretty cool.

00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:11.400
And I was lucky enough that twice,

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:14.170
a lunch lady book has won a
Children's Choice Book Award.

00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:17.150
And it's such an honor
to win any award.

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:20.040
But to win an award that's voted
on by the readers themselves

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:22.990
because then my readers
put my name up in lights

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:25.460
in Times Square because of that.

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:27.830
And, of course, I meet a lot
of lunch ladies [laughter],

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:30.870
as I travel the country, you know.

00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:35.460
And they tell me how much
the series means to them.

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:37.550
Because the lunch lady
-- in popular culture,

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:40.010
the lunch lady isn't
treated very kindly.

00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:42.600
You know often you see a cartoon
character [inaudible] lunch lady

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:45.390
and maybe they're mean or not
nice, or serve awful food.

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:48.260
And you know a lunch lady
in your real life you know.

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:50.560
That couldn't be further
from the truth.

00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:52.390
And it meant a lot to
my old lunch ladies.

00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:56.980
I gave them artwork when the
books were first published

00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:58.280
at the book signing in Worcester.

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:02.540
And I later learned how much that
acknowledgement meant to them,

00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:05.740
and I was really touched and moved
by how much that meant to them.

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:08.470
So I created a day called
School Lunch Hero Day.

00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:12.210
It's the first Friday in May.

00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:14.530
We've celebrated twice so far.

00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:18.110
It's a day where kids can
tap into their own creativity

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:21.230
to say thank you in
however way they choose.

00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:23.950
So kids came up with
the greatest projects.

00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:26.000
This student made a hamburger card.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.740
This classroom, they made a pizza

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:33.110
and every student signed a
pepperoni to say thank you.

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:38.700
Kids made their own comics,
starring the cartoon lunch lady

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:40.180
and their actual lunch lady.

00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:42.540
So they asked their lunch
lady to pose for photos,

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:45.690
and they printed them out
and put them in there.

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:49.720 position:56%
And I just saw you know through
social media and people emailing me,

00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:54.340
these wonderful smiles from
all across the country.

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:56.100
But then politicians get involved.

00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:57.690
And this is something
I wasn't expecting,

00:32:57.690 --> 00:32:59.270
but people started
sending me news clippings,

00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:03.220
where you know senators stopped
by their local elementary school.

00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:05.830
Lieutenant governors stopped by.

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:07.470
The mayor of Houston sent

00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:11.510
out an official legal proclamation
[laughter] proclaiming it School

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:15.050
Lunch Hero Day in the
city of Houston.

00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:18.570
And Michelle Obama's Let's
Move program has blogged

00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:21.820
about encouraging their members,
and the people that are involved

00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:23.460
with their program and
reading their blog,

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:25.240
to celebrate School Lunch Hero Day.

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:28.100
And it all goes back to the fact

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:30.960
that I was a kid just
like all of you.

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:33.680
I love stories.

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:35.390
I loved reading stories.

00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:37.480
I loved getting to know characters.

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:40.400
And I loved inventing
my own characters

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:42.740
and writing stories for them.

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:44.530
And I'm always working
on new stories.

00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:46.430
So I have a new picture book

00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:49.560
that was just published earlier
this year called Peanut Butter

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:50.860
and Jellyfish.

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:54.920
About a seahorse and a jellyfish
that are best friends and a crab,

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:57.040
who isn't exactly nice to them.

00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:02.400
But they kind of get to the bottom
of why he's behaving the way he is.

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:07.460
And I have a chapter book series
called Platypus Police Squad.

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:11.240
It's about these two cops,
detective Rick Zengo.

00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:13.880 position:56%
He's the hotshot young rookie, who
plays fast and loose with the rules.

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:16.570
And he's partnered with
the old gruff old-timer,

00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:19.810
who sort of lost his spark
named detective Corey O'Malley.

00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:21.110
They're total opposites.

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:22.820
They need to learn to work
together to keep the city safe.

00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:25.310
And they're platypuses.

00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:28.480
And the first book is
called The Frog Who Croaked.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:31.190
The second book is called
The Ostrich Conspiracy.

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:34.480
And the third book, which
I'm working on now at home,

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:38.610
is called Last Panda Standing.

00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:43.860
I'm also the proud coeditor of
an anthology called Comic Squad,

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:46.260
which recently was published.

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:48.500

and Jenny Holm

So they're good friends of mine.

00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:59.240
And we were talking online one
day about comics and kids' comics.

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:02.550
And the comics that we loved
when we were young and how,

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:06.340
wouldn't it be great if there was
an anthology that could team people

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:08.530
up to make little short stories?

00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:10.320
And we thought well, you know what?

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.140
Instead of saying somebody
should do that.

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:13.770
We said well, we'll do it.

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:16.230
And we came up with the theme
of recess for the first book.

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:19.250
So every cartoonist
made a little mini comic

00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:20.880
around the theme of recess.

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:25.670
And Dave Pilkey who created
Captain Underpants made a piece.

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:29.070
And Raina Telgemeier who
created Smile, did a piece.

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:31.470
And Dave Roman and Dan Santad.

00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:33.820
And we're really proud of the book.

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:36.070
And actually we have a new roster.

00:35:36.070 --> 00:35:38.590
There's a second comic
squad, and we're gathering

00:35:38.590 --> 00:35:41.320
up other cartoonists, as well.

to the comic section.

What inspired me to make

Well, it probably goes
back to what I read.

00:43:30.490 --> 00:43:32.160

to help me learn how

00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:45.320
to draw is I would
say take a picture.

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:47.390
Take a drawing of a
smurf or of Snoopy.

00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:50.850
And I would try to copy it,
and that taught me how to draw.

00:43:50.850 --> 00:43:55.250
And then that knowledge I gained
from copying those drawings,

00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:57.660

If I ever get frustrated by what
I'm working on, the best thing

00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:04.070
to do is just walk away
and do something else.

00:46:04.070 --> 00:46:08.500
Maybe I might walk my dog and
get outside for a little bit.

00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:10.670
I'm trying to every day
make a piece of art --

00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:13.720
that maybe it only takes
me 10 minutes to do,

but it's something not to do with
the art I need for the books.

00:46:16.350 --> 00:46:19.930
Because to write and to illustrate.

00:46:19.930 --> 00:46:21.920
There's so many things
you have to think about.

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:24.080
You have to think about your space.

00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:26.530
You need to think about
how you feel, too.

00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:30.550 position:56%
So getting you know good exercise
and making sure you're eating right.

of those things factor

00:46:33.350 --> 00:46:35.700
into the work that you make.

00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:37.880
Now I know there's so many other
people with their hands raised,

00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:41.960
but I want to be able to draw
some pictures for you guys.

00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:44.260
And I'm going to give
you guys a couple

00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:46.930
of little drawing lessons here.

00:46:46.930 --> 00:46:50.840
Now I mentioned in my slide
talk that when I'm at home

00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:53.460
and I'm working on the art
for these finished books,

00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:56.860
I have a special pencil
called non-photo blue.

00:46:56.860 --> 00:47:00.230
And if I were to draw with
a non-photo blue pencil,

00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:02.230
you wouldn't be able to
see those marks from afar

00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:05.830
because it's a very faint
mark, very faint line.

00:47:05.830 --> 00:47:09.940 position:56%
So I have this light blue marker
that will sort of stand in for that,

00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:12.390
to give you an idea of what
the process looks like.

00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:15.730
So like I said, every character
is made up of a series of shapes.

00:47:15.730 --> 00:47:17.630
So when I'm drawing lunch lady,

00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:21.140
I start off by drawing
an upside-down teardrop

00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:25.170
and then a regular-ended teardrop.

00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:27.550
And I'm drawing the gesture.

00:47:27.550 --> 00:47:29.730
The gesture is like
where the limbs are.

00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:31.510
Like how the character is posed.

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:33.500
And I'm going to have her
jumping through the air.

00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:36.960
So I think about where her legs go.

00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:41.430
Not a lot of detail yet, is there?

00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:46.200
Because it's a lot easier
to make changes now.

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:49.330
So if I were to start by drawing
the details of the character's eyes

00:47:49.330 --> 00:47:51.340 position:56%
and face and I would get to the end.

00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:52.640
And I said I want to make a change.

00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:55.090
But I spent all that time and
all that work on the detail.

00:47:55.090 --> 00:47:57.710
Because now I can look at
that and say, you know what?

00:47:57.710 --> 00:48:01.990
I'm going to make her head a
little bit smaller, like so.

00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:05.980
So now on top of that gesture
sketch, I'll layer the details.

00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:08.280
So I have the character's hair.

00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:16.560
And eyes and face.

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:19.970
And I'm pretty loose with my marks.

00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:25.000
Close her gloves.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.300
Her sleeves.

00:48:30.830 --> 00:48:35.180
So once I have a good foundation
down, then I would take out my ink.

00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:39.100
And again, when I'm at home, I take
a brush, and I dip it into ink.

00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:41.070
That would be logistically
difficult.

00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:42.590
And I flew here by
airplane this morning.

00:48:42.590 --> 00:48:44.850
I would need something
smaller than 4 ounces.

00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:46.780
I have a big old ink jar there.

00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:50.510
So, I going to use a Sharpie
marker as a stand-in for that.

[ Drawing ]

00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:03.820
And again, when this artwork
-- when it gets scanned in,

00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:08.490
and I set that scanner
to black and white,

00:49:08.490 --> 00:49:14.870
the computer doesn't register
the blue pencil marks.

00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:19.510
It only registers -- it can only
see that crisp black line work.

So, if you were ever able to get a
look at some of the original artwork

00:49:25.790 --> 00:49:28.270
up close, you would see all

00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:31.530
of the underworking
underneath all of the art.

00:49:31.530 --> 00:49:33.210 position:56%

00:49:33.210 --> 00:49:34.510
You just see the finished lines.

00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:38.730
So you may have been under the
assumption that I start off

00:49:38.730 --> 00:49:44.640
by drawing the lines that
intricate and that's spot-on.

00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:48.250

myself to make some mistakes

00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:50.510

I went to the final art.

00:49:58.730 --> 00:50:01.500
there's another character that's
very important to the story.

00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:06.950

up of a series of teardrops,

there's someone else who's
made up of a series of circles.

is made up of shapes.

to just the main shapes,

And we're going to
talk about emotions.

00:51:54.250 --> 00:51:58.900
Because illustration is all about
visually communicating the story.

00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:01.740
So how a character
feels is communicated

when you're really angry.

00:52:38.190 --> 00:52:40.050
You're angry.

00:52:40.050 --> 00:52:42.060
Your eyebrows cross.

00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:46.190
And what happens is your eyebrows
are pushing together towards the

00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:51.330
center of your face, and it's
wrinkling up your forehead a bit

00:52:51.330 --> 00:52:54.770 position:56%
And you also -- you were so angry --

00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:58.400
you were so angry that you
tilted your heads down.

00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:00.670
And you were looking up.

00:53:00.670 --> 00:53:05.350
So you can have those angry
eyebrows with that little line,

00:53:05.350 --> 00:53:08.520
but see how there's space
between the eyes and the eyebrows?

00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:11.360
It's not going to be the case here.

00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:14.840
Those eyebrows are going to be
covering the very top of the eyes

00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:16.640
because your head is tilted down.

00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:22.540
[ Drawing ]

00:53:22.540 --> 00:53:24.360
Show me what it looks like
when you're really sad.

00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:25.660
Like it was just an awful day.

00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:27.240
You're really sad.

00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:28.540
Your eyebrows.

00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:30.340
Okay, your eyebrows all came up.

00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:35.040
[ Background Conversations ]

00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:37.510
And you all pouted a little
bit with your lips right there.

00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:41.810
[ Background Conversations ]

00:53:41.810 --> 00:53:44.710
Now show me what it looks like --

00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:49.920
show me what it looks like
when you're scared [yelling].

00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:52.780
Your eyes all got really big.

00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:55.360
Your eyes got really big.

00:53:55.360 --> 00:54:02.550
And the trick to showing
that a character is scared is

00:54:02.550 --> 00:54:06.510
that not only are the eyes bigger
but the pupils are smaller.

00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:12.510

00:54:12.510 --> 00:54:16.700
[ Laughter ]

00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:19.650
Now there are so many other
emotions that we could cover.

00:54:19.650 --> 00:54:23.750 position:56%
And I encourage you to explore those
on your own by just sitting in front

00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:25.370
of a mirror and making faces.

00:54:25.370 --> 00:54:28.700 position:56%
Actually when I'm at home, my family
catches me doing this all the time.

00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:30.000
I'll be drawing.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.410
And I'm making the face of the
character that I'm drawing.

00:54:33.410 --> 00:54:34.750
I'm becoming that character.

00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:39.940
But now this applies if
your character is human,

00:54:39.940 --> 00:54:43.510
or if your character
is maybe a lion.

00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:49.180
[ Laughter ]

00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:50.980
Maybe a pig.

00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:57.180
[ Laughter ]

00:54:57.180 --> 00:54:58.980
Maybe a space alien.

00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:02.100
[ Laughter ]

00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:03.400
Maybe an elephant.

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:09.870
And with an elephant, I can use
that trunk to show the emotion.

00:55:09.870 --> 00:55:14.250
Or if I were drawing a rabbit,
I could use those ears to show

00:55:14.250 --> 00:55:18.110
that the character was
sad or surprised or happy.

00:55:18.110 --> 00:55:20.680
So out of everything that I
talked about this morning,

00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:27.630
what I hope that you remember the
most is that my career, my journey,

00:55:27.630 --> 00:55:32.010
as an author and as an artist,
began when I was your age.

00:55:32.010 --> 00:55:34.960
And I want you to make sure that
you consider yourselves authors

00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:36.260
and illustrators.

00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:40.730
And that please don't wait for
this to be a school assignment.

00:55:40.730 --> 00:55:44.580
Because it does not need
to be a required thing

00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:46.580
because it's so much fun.

00:55:46.580 --> 00:55:49.790
It's so much fun to
use your imagination.

00:55:49.790 --> 00:55:53.250
Escape from your real
life for a little bit.

00:55:53.250 --> 00:55:55.430
And take a blank piece of paper

00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:59.560
and pour your imagination
out onto that paper.

00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:03.450
So after school, on your own,
without any grownup asking you to,

00:56:03.450 --> 00:56:07.330
get a hold of some paper
and make awesome things.

00:56:07.330 --> 00:56:08.660
Okay? Thank you guys so much,

00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:10.620
and thank you the Young Reader
Center for having me today.

00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:12.420
Thank you.
