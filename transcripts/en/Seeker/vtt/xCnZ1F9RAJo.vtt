00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.770
Iceberg ahead!

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.870
Shhh...don’t scare it!

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.340
How else are we going to capture the berg
and bring it back home?

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.830
There are some downright crazy schemes out
there that defy common sense.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.010
Ready for one?

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:17.359
A United Arab Emirates company wants to tow
a 3.5 million-ton iceberg from Antarctica

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:19.289
and bring it back to their desert homeland.

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.079
They want to use the iceberg as a tourist
attraction and as a source of fresh, drinkable

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:25.439
water for their citizens.

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.429
In the firm’s splashy ad, animals in Antarctica
come along for the ride too, including polar

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:34.530
bears! … which don’t actually live in
Antarctica.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.719
Also, what happens when they get there?

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.739
They’re not exactly, like, set up for desert
life…

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:40.739
Humans suck.

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.289
Okay, we’ll play ball for a second.

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:49.430
This is how iceberg towing could “work,”
based on the latest computer simulations.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.949
An iceberg would be carefully selected for
shape and size, and then it’d be fitted

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.390
with a giant insulated skirt at the waterline.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.320
Then the berg would be pulled by a gigantic
tugboat that would travel at a speed of roughly

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:12.361
one knot… which means it would take 283
days of nonstop, full bore tugging, 24/7 to

00:01:12.361 --> 00:01:13.361
get there.

00:01:13.361 --> 00:01:18.409
BTW in that time they estimate the iceberg
would lose over 30% of its overall mass.This

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:24.909
all sounds totally doable in theory, and that’s
exactly where this zany idea has existed for

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:26.290
centuries: in theory.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.119
See, iceberg towing isn’t a new concept.

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:29.119
It’s one of those technological wonders
that’s floated around media circles and

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:30.119
keeps popping up like a never-ending game
of wac-a-mole.

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.490
The idea first appeared in the 1800s, initially
proposed as a way to "equalize the temperature

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.490
of the earth."

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.490
They were worried about rising temperatures
back then!

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.490
Neat huh.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.000
Iceberg towing kept circling in dream space
until it got some serious attention around

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
the 1970s.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.880
NASA and various think tanks wrote technical
reports on its feasibility (Spoiler: not

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.899
cost effective).

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.590
Then a French engineer and a Saudi prince
proposed using icebergs to solve the world’s

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.010
growing water crisis.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:59.750
There was a conference in Iowa, a landlocked
state of all places, devoted exclusively on

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.720
how to export icebergs.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.049
To get delegates excited, the Prince actually
shipped a “one-ton mini berg” from Alaska

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.590
to Iowa to be used for research and to keep
cocktails chilled.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.170
Suffice it to say, the plans were all at sea..

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.480
Beyond the technical challenges iceberg towing
poses, there are other factors that make this

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.330
incredibly impractical.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.980
First, the cost.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:29.200
One iceberg-towing vessel can cost $75,000
a day, and to get a massive berg from Antarctica

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.430
to UAE -- for this journey that might be 21-and-a-quarter
million dollars.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.550
And they might need multiple towing ships
for months.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.150
It might be easier to just build a desalination
plant.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.750
Secondly, taking icebergs out of their native
habitat could fly in the face of international

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.680
law and wouldn’t be great for the environment.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.920
The eco firm claims that the iceberg will
transform UAE’s desert landscape into a

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.590
lush paradise, creating a “microclimate”
around the glacier.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.489
While it’s true that icebergs can create
a mini climate within its proximity, it’s

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.950
not going to turn the desert into a cloud
forest.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.100
While iceberg towing to quench the world’s
thirst is still a lot of hype, moving ice

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.060
around to suit our human needs does actually
happen today.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.280
And guess who’s chiefly behind that?

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.280
Oil companies.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.680
Sometimes megaton icebergs can change direction
in a storm and when pushed by high wind speeds,

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.370
they'll be on a collision course with an oil
rig … which can't exactly run away.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:29.209
So, to make areas safer for oil and gas exploration,
companies will lasso looming begs and use

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.849
tugboats to move them just a bit away from
oil platforms.

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:37.550
I have to say, an iceberg posing a challenge
to an oil rig is a feat of poetic mother earth

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.960
justice.

Have you ever thought about that undersea oil?

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.470
It’s made of ancient plants and animals…
it’s a fossil fuel… so how did so much

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:07.980
of it get under the oceans?
