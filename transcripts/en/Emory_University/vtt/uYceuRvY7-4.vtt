00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:17.550
Medical education over the last 500 years, 
the single most important factor is

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:26.490
mentoring and that each each young
student has someone who is a role model,

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:33.789
and I think that the department has been
incredibly excellent in having a huge

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:40.329
number of people who are role models to
the young students and house staff.

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:46.179
And the people, the teachers in the Department of
Medicine, have given of themselves freely

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:54.329
to the house staff and students,
and this is a vitally important part of

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:01.089
producing excellent young physicians.
One of the notable characteristics of people

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:09.790
who go into medicine is that they have a
very very low threshold of boredom, and

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:19.240
it takes continually new challenges
to keep them alive and interested.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:28.680
And what teaching gives to
the faculty member is this continual

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:36.670
excitement and continual new things.
Most of the learning of faculty comes

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.790
from the house staff and students,
It's very much a two-way street.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:49.470
But what the students and house staff provide to
the faculty is a continual way of

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:56.840
keeping them from getting bored, 
because life in teaching is continually exciting.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:04.460
I've come to think in fact that
the word "teaching" probably shouldn't

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:13.940
exist, that the word is "learning," and what
makes successful teachers are people with

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:21.590
whom the student has a mutual learning
experience. And so what keeps the faculty

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.780
at Emory from being bored is the
outstanding students and house staff that

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:36.310
we have and they thereby avoid one of
the big traps of going into something

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:54.500
like medicine where one can become 
bored if you not careful.
