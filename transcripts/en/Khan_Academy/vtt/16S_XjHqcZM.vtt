00:00:00.037 --> 00:00:01.642
- [Instructor] What I'd
like to do in this video

00:00:01.642 --> 00:00:05.456
is explore the core
spiritual ideas of Buddhism.

00:00:05.456 --> 00:00:06.912
And we're going to do it relative to

00:00:06.912 --> 00:00:09.200
the core spiritual ideas of Hinduism

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.080
as described in the Upanishads.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.370
One, because there are
significant parallels

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.990
and also because Buddha and Buddhism

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.490
grew out of a Hindu tradition.

00:00:19.685 --> 00:00:23.485
So in both belief systems,
there's this notion

00:00:23.485 --> 00:00:27.652
that the reality that we
are in is a quasi illusion.

00:00:29.502 --> 00:00:33.633
In the Upanishads it's described as Maya.

00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:35.819
That there's a true self.

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:39.952
That there's this atman,
which is of the same substance

00:00:39.952 --> 00:00:43.109
as the true nature of reality, of Brahman.

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:45.910
That all things are actually connected.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.212
This notion of the individual
is just an illusion

00:00:49.212 --> 00:00:52.054
and it's illusion given
to us by this Maya.

00:00:52.054 --> 00:00:54.644
And the Maya isn't just
our sensory perception,

00:00:54.644 --> 00:00:57.358
it's even our notions of ego

00:00:57.358 --> 00:01:01.056
and possibly even
time-space and causality.

00:01:01.056 --> 00:01:03.419
In Buddhism, there is a parallel notion.

00:01:03.419 --> 00:01:06.479
That all of what we consider to be reality

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.749
is just happening in our mind.

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:12.074
There isn't anything more real than that.

00:01:12.074 --> 00:01:13.799
And we are subject to this reality

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.772
because of our constant craving

00:01:15.772 --> 00:01:18.066
for that which is impermanent.

00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:20.674
This craving is called Trishna,
which is the Sanskrit word,

00:01:20.674 --> 00:01:24.295
or Tanha, which is the Pali
word, the language of Buddha.

00:01:24.295 --> 00:01:26.011
Now because of this craving,

00:01:26.011 --> 00:01:27.969
it leads to this constant suffering,

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:31.126
this Dhukka, which is really this reality

00:01:31.126 --> 00:01:34.285
that we are subjecting ourselves to.

00:01:34.285 --> 00:01:37.262
Now in either case, we take action

00:01:37.262 --> 00:01:40.374
and that action leads to consequences.

00:01:40.374 --> 00:01:44.541
And so in both traditions,
we have this notion of Karma.

00:01:46.315 --> 00:01:49.205
And that the Karma, the
actions with consequences,

00:01:49.205 --> 00:01:52.548
lead to further actions and consequences,

00:01:52.548 --> 00:01:56.728
not just in this life,
but in future realities,

00:01:56.728 --> 00:02:00.333
in whatever next Maya or reality

00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:03.926
or life that we take on.

00:02:03.926 --> 00:02:06.931
And this constant cycle
of birth and rebirth

00:02:06.931 --> 00:02:11.189
is referred to as Samsara
in both of the traditions.

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:14.290
So you see this commonality.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.086
Now, in Hinduism there's this idea

00:02:17.086 --> 00:02:20.899
of trying to escape from
Samsara through meditation,

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:23.618
by being able to see through the Maya

00:02:23.618 --> 00:02:28.486
and merge your atman with
Brahman, seeing that all are one.

00:02:28.486 --> 00:02:31.155
In Buddhism, there is a similar idea.

00:02:31.155 --> 00:02:35.574
Through meditation, through
following the eightfold path,

00:02:35.574 --> 00:02:38.732
by recognizing the Four Noble Truths

00:02:38.732 --> 00:02:42.901
you should escape from this
craving of impermanent things.

00:02:42.901 --> 00:02:44.960
And in either tradition as you do that,

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.079
you escape from the Samsara.

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:51.079
And when you escape from the Samsara

00:02:52.858 --> 00:02:56.858
and this cycle of Karma
leading to more and more

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.037
and the Maya and the Dhukka disappear,

00:03:02.037 --> 00:03:05.314
in Hinduism the term is Moksha,

00:03:05.314 --> 00:03:08.849
you have freed yourself from this cycle.

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.240
In Buddhism, the Sanskrit
word is actually Nirvana,

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.461
which literally means blown out,

00:03:14.461 --> 00:03:17.341
but it's merging with the emptiness.

00:03:17.341 --> 00:03:21.091
So even though officially,
a Hindu might say,

00:03:21.942 --> 00:03:25.064
through the Moksha your atman is merging

00:03:25.064 --> 00:03:27.548
with the ultimate reality of Brahman,

00:03:27.548 --> 00:03:30.872
while in Buddhism, when
you achieve Nirvana,

00:03:30.872 --> 00:03:32.969
you have recognized your nonself

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:35.711
and it has merged with the emptiness,

00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:38.027
with the non-being.

00:03:38.027 --> 00:03:39.147
Now there is debate.

00:03:39.147 --> 00:03:41.708
Is Buddhism saying that
you should try to achieve

00:03:41.708 --> 00:03:43.649
a state of non-existence?

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:44.898
Many people would disagree.

00:03:44.898 --> 00:03:47.235
They would say Nirvana is
actually the ultimate bliss,

00:03:47.235 --> 00:03:49.402
to recognize your nonself.

00:03:50.401 --> 00:03:52.051
Some would say, hey this is just a matter

00:03:52.051 --> 00:03:53.380
of what words you use.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.916
In either case, you are recognizing

00:03:55.916 --> 00:03:57.806
that there isn't the individual,

00:03:57.806 --> 00:04:01.494
that you are merging
with the true reality.

00:04:01.494 --> 00:04:04.073
That you are merging with the universe,

00:04:04.073 --> 00:04:05.802
whether you consider the
universe to be Brahman

00:04:05.802 --> 00:04:10.093
or whether you consider the
universe to be emptiness.

00:04:10.093 --> 00:04:11.645
But in either tradition,

00:04:11.645 --> 00:04:13.853
this is viewed as a state of release,

00:04:13.853 --> 00:04:16.281
as a state of ultimate bliss

00:04:16.281 --> 00:04:19.352
and something that you should try

00:04:19.352 --> 00:04:21.602
to get to through practice.
