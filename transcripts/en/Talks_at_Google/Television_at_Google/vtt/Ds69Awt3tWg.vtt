00:00:00.324 --> 00:00:02.990
ALAN SEALES: Now here to discuss
their first book, "Dream Home,"

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.222
please welcome Jonathan
and Drew Scott.

00:00:05.222 --> 00:00:09.316
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.316 --> 00:00:10.690
DREW SCOTT: Well,
thank you, sir.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:11.564
ALAN SEALES: Welcome.

00:00:11.564 --> 00:00:12.435
Have a seat.

00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:13.810
Or you can sit
here, if you want.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:15.851
JONATHAN SCOTT: The fact
that you dressed like me

00:00:15.851 --> 00:00:17.167
is just so nice-- it's so kind.

00:00:17.167 --> 00:00:19.000
ALAN SEALES: It was
actually my wife's idea.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.530
DREW SCOTT: Oh, yeah?

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:20.270
Is she dressing you, still?

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:20.810
JONATHAN SCOTT: I prefer a suit.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:21.430
DREW SCOTT: Are you in here?

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:22.440
JONATHAN SCOTT: You should
be in a suit like me.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.640
ALAN SEALES: Yes.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.180
She's back there.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:23.595
JONATHAN SCOTT: Oh, hi.

00:00:23.595 --> 00:00:24.210
DREW SCOTT: Oh, hello.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.310
JONATHAN SCOTT: Love you.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.650
DREW SCOTT: I would prefer if
you dress him like me, not him.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:27.190
JONATHAN SCOTT: Oof.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:27.510
DREW SCOTT: Well,
yeah, if you're

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.890
a fan of "Property
Brothers," why aren't you

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:29.790
fan-girling more?

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:30.640
I wanted to hear
more high-pitched

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.758
squealing out of you.

00:00:31.758 --> 00:00:32.634
ALAN SEALES:
(SQUEALING) Oh, my god.

00:00:32.634 --> 00:00:33.510
It's the Property Brothers.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.650
DREW SCOTT: That's it.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:34.900
JONATHAN SCOTT: We did a talk.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.360
We were in Minneapolis.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.480
And there was-- not that I'm
bragging-- about 4,000 people

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.260
showed up.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.065
[LAUGHING]

00:00:41.065 --> 00:00:41.980
ALAN SEALES: We can't fit
that many in this room.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.090
JONATHAN SCOTT: So it
was a big convention.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.980
It was a big amphitheater.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.840
We were in there and we
were doing our talk, I mean.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.920
And when we first
walked up, there

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.544
was cheering and
cheering and cheering.

00:00:48.544 --> 00:00:51.950
There's always that one person
who's late to the party.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.810
And so just as everyone
was dying down,

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.300
this one voice booms
out, (DEEP VOICE) Yeah!

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.367
So we've got, like, a sea
of 3,999 women and one dude.

00:01:00.367 --> 00:01:02.450
DREW SCOTT: Yeah, it was
all, I said, so who here,

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.991
let's be honest-- because most
of our die-hard fans know that

00:01:04.991 --> 00:01:06.130
he's single [PURR]--

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.150
JONATHAN SCOTT: (LAUGHING) Yeah.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.000
DREW SCOTT: And so I'm like,
who here's Team Jonathan?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.120
You hear all the girls scream.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.140
And then, I'm like,
who here is Team Dew?

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.723
Literally, in a crowd
of 4,000 people,

00:01:12.723 --> 00:01:15.000
one dude's like,
(DEEP VOICE) Drew!

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.920
JONATHAN SCOTT: Yeah.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.720
DREW SCOTT: Like, thanks, man.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:16.950
Got you back.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.783
JONATHAN SCOTT: I'd
keep an eye on that guy.

00:01:18.783 --> 00:01:19.320
Yeah.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.320
ALAN SEALES: I just want to
point out, I have those socks.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.880
DREW SCOTT: Oh, do you?

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:22.560
ALAN SEALES: Yes.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.640
DREW SCOTT: I am a sock guy.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.990
JONATHAN SCOTT: Do you have
the matching underwear?

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.180
ALAN SEALES: I have my--
my wrench socks on today.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.760
DREW SCOTT: The wrench?

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.010
ALAN SEALES: Yes.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.710
DREW SCOTT: You should be
wearing the wrench socks.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.240
JONATHAN SCOTT: I don't even
know what I dressed myself

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.440
with today.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.660
DREW SCOTT: I'm wearing--

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:32.810
JONATHAN SCOTT: Oh, well,
they're still in there.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.170
DREW SCOTT: I'm wearing my
wrench underwear, though.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.530
It's--

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.600
JONATHAN SCOTT:
No, you sit down.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.990
DREW SCOTT: Yeah.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.850
JONATHAN SCOTT: By the
way, is anyone else

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.289
in here wearing a suit and tie?

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:39.330
Or, is Drew the only one?

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.996
DREW SCOTT: Yes.

00:01:39.996 --> 00:01:42.350
Our producer, back there,
somebody in the back.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.080
I like your style.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.660
JONATHAN SCOTT: So we went
to Nashville for the CMA.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.230
We were hosting CMA last
year-- country music festival.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.490
120 degrees out, and Drew
wore a three-piece suit

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.750
to a country music festival.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.890
DREW SCOTT: So?

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:54.380
JONATHAN SCOTT: And
I'm, like, the only guy.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.130
And I got on a bucking bull.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.670
And he jumped.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:58.530
He has to outdo me.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.880
And even if I'm walking to
the car, he has to outdo me.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.819
And he jumps on the
bucking bull, rips

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:04.610
the ass out of his
pants, and he had, like,

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:05.730
fuchsia underwear on.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.320
Drew brought fuchsia
to Nashville.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.813
And Getty was right on it.

00:02:09.813 --> 00:02:10.479
DREW SCOTT: Yep.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:11.009
There we go.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.310
Do I look more Google-esque?

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.920
ALAN SEALES: There you go.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:13.790
DREW SCOTT: Google-esque.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:14.810
ALAN SEALES: There, I
untied your tie for you.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.850
So you're actually here
to discuss your book.

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:17.516
DREW SCOTT: Yes.

00:02:17.516 --> 00:02:18.620
JONATHAN SCOTT: Oh, right.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.577
ALAN SEALES: So this
is your first book,

00:02:20.577 --> 00:02:22.410
"Dream Home, the Property
Brothers' Ultimate

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.340
Guide to Finding and
Fixing Your Perfect House."

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.000
I found it incredibly
helpful for me.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.290
I'm in the process of looking
for a townhouse in Brooklyn.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.520
So I want to hire you guys.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.100
I hope you're available.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.380
JONATHAN SCOTT: Done.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.920
DREW SCOTT: Let me
ask one question.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.550
Wife?

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:36.340
Wife?

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.346
Is he handy?

00:02:37.346 --> 00:02:38.470
AUDIENCE: Yes, he is handy.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.050
DREW SCOTT: Oh, really.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.383
I'm looking to replace Jonathan.

00:02:40.383 --> 00:02:41.591
JONATHAN SCOTT: All right.

00:02:41.591 --> 00:02:42.090
Good.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.130
ALAN SEALES: We've
got the stubble going.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.760
DREW SCOTT: Yeah,
I was going to say,

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.580
you're, like, literally
cloning Jonathan today.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.790
You could be the other brother.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:47.340
JONATHAN SCOTT:
What would you say

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.940
is the one thing
that stood out to you

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.400
that was, right off the top,
you're like-- oh, obviously.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.430
Yeah, that's good.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.600
That helps.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.810
ALAN SEALES: Making a list
between the must-haves

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:57.450
and the nice-to-haves.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.715
DREW SCOTT: Yeah.

00:02:57.715 --> 00:02:58.220
JONATHAN SCOTT: Yes.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.730
Which is true.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.271
So when we-- whenever
we're sitting--

00:03:00.271 --> 00:03:01.860
and this is how the
book came to be.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.890
So we've been doing
this for 20 years.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.929
Coming out of high
school, we started

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:06.970
investing in real estate.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.530
And we're like, we didn't
want to be struggling artists,

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.030
actors.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.040
He's a director.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.910
I'm a magician.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.369
So we're like, we want to
fund our creative efforts

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:14.160
with a real estate.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.560
DREW SCOTT: No big deal.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.360
Yeah, yeah, I'm a magician.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.861
Anyway, so--

00:03:15.861 --> 00:03:16.735
JONATHAN SCOTT: Yeah.

00:03:16.735 --> 00:03:17.315
No big deal.

00:03:17.315 --> 00:03:17.880
Kapow!

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.510
I always carry one
of those smoke bombs

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.840
with me, just in case.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.350
Anyway, so we wanted to make
sure that we knew everything.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.317
So we read every book
we could on real estate.

00:03:25.317 --> 00:03:27.150
I even watched the
infomercials with the guy

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.070
with the babes and boats.

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.110
And I'm like, oh, I could
have babes and boats.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.380
Still don't have it.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.730
So we thought, we want to
take this compilation of all

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:35.920
the information we've
learned all the years,

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.680
any mistakes we made when
we were starting out,

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.263
prevent other people
from making them,

00:03:39.263 --> 00:03:41.972
and really have one guide
that helps everybody.

00:03:41.972 --> 00:03:44.180
In the process, as we were
doing those live lectures,

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.900
like in Minneapolis,
we realized--

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.502
we would ask an auditorium
4,000 people, and we'd be like,

00:03:48.502 --> 00:03:50.960
how many of you did this with
your real estate professional

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.190
when you were looking to buy?

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.980
And go through the checklist
of all the questions

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.021
you have to ask yourself.

00:03:55.021 --> 00:03:58.479
And of 4,000 people, there would
maybe be 10 hands that go up.

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:01.020
So that's when we said, well,
then there needs to be a guide.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.970
There needs to be something
simple that people can follow.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:03.850
DREW SCOTT: That's
when we realized

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:04.967
that homeowners are dumb.

00:04:04.967 --> 00:04:05.800
JONATHAN SCOTT: Yes.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.480
DREW SCOTT: Oh, I mean, no.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.230
I didn't say that.

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.729
No.

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:08.422
I'm just joking.

00:04:08.422 --> 00:04:11.960
They're ignorant to how to
maximize their investment, how

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.780
to make sure they're
protecting themselves,

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.020
and what to do for design.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.501
99% of people out there don't
know how to design a space.

00:04:17.501 --> 00:04:19.500
They can know that they
love this big open room,

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.649
but what do I do with it?

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:21.240
So that's why we
came out with the--

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.290
JONATHAN SCOTT: Well, and
it's overwhelming, too.

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:23.800
Because we have
it, as well, where

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.460
we'll have clients that come to
us that are first-time buyers,

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.550
and you know it's scary.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.100
Like, they don't
know what to expect,

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.520
and this is the biggest
investment of their lives,

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.680
and what do I do?

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.490
And if they're not even paired
with the right professional--

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.448
sometimes they've worked
with other real estate

00:04:36.448 --> 00:04:39.030
professionals who are, like,
fast-talking city Realtors.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.720
You can't-- you have to find
someone who works at the same

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.490
pace that you do--

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.600
DREW SCOTT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.510
JONATHAN SCOTT: --and
will answer questions.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:44.980
If you're ever-- one of the
other things in the book

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.870
is, if you're ever working with
a professional-- contractor,

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.390
lawyer, Realtor,
whatever-- who makes

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.530
you feel like an idiot
for asking a question,

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.180
you are working with
the wrong person.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.140
You're in charge.

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.320
You're driving the ship.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.190
This is your money.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.310
So you want to make
sure that you're

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.340
going to be happy at
the end of the day.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.730
ALAN SEALES: That's the
culture we promote here, too.

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:01.000
JONATHAN SCOTT: Yeah.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.660
There you go.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:02.360
See, I should get a job here.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.840
ALAN SEALES: A team lead should
not make you feel like a jerk

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:04.390
for asking a question.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.730
DREW SCOTT: Never.

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.390
No, what's-- I've never heard
someone say that the best way

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.469
to learn is to have a boss who
is a jerk and belittles you

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:11.010
every minute.

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.720
Or, wait.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.390
Have I heard that before?

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.680
I don't know.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.780
That's what he does to me.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:14.160
JONATHAN SCOTT: Yeah.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.470
DREW SCOTT: But, yeah.

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:14.850
Exactly.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:15.300
We like to inspire--

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.110
JONATHAN SCOTT: We're siblings.

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.180
ALAN SEALES: Have you worked
with people like that?

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.221
JONATHAN SCOTT: Oh, yeah.

00:05:19.221 --> 00:05:21.510
There's a mentality,
sometimes, with people-- hey,

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.245
I'm the one who works every day.

00:05:23.245 --> 00:05:26.860
So there the mentality
that some people

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.780
like to lead by intimidation.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.210
I don't think that's successful.

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:31.980
I think that's a
very short-term goal,

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.830
but it doesn't lead
to-- we're very similar.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.010
And, actually, it was a
tour that we had done ages

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:38.980
ago with Google, as
well, that-- we wanted

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.840
to create for our office,
Scott Brothers Entertainment,

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.070
an environment where people
wanted to come and work.

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:44.420
We do fun things.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.660
I mean, we just had all
of our employees-- suck

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.820
on this, Google-- we booked
out an entire cruise ship

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.890
and took 2,000 fans and all
of our staff and everybody

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:56.410
through the Caribbean
for four days.

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:56.910
And it was great.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.900
It's great just to do
things outside of the office

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.000
space that help you bond.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.319
Because then, when
so-and-so hits you up,

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:04.610
when you're in a rush and
you need something real fast,

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:05.570
you're a little more
willing to do it,

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:06.350
because you guys have bonded.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.700
DREW SCOTT: I'm
pretty sure Google

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.062
owned the ship and
the island we went to.

00:06:09.062 --> 00:06:10.064
I'm just saying.

00:06:10.064 --> 00:06:11.230
JONATHAN SCOTT: That's true.

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.520
That's correct.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.640
ALAN SEALES: Well, you've
touched on some of this

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.877
already, but I wanted to kind of
get back into how you started.

00:06:15.877 --> 00:06:17.210
Like, so Drew, you're a Realtor.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.180
Jonathan, contractor.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.346
You're both business owners.

00:06:19.346 --> 00:06:21.690
You were both actors or,
obviously, still are,

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:22.283
at this point.

00:06:22.283 --> 00:06:23.310
Because you guys are--

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.810
DREW SCOTT: We still
do some acting.

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.260
And, I mean, that acting
background and our improv--

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.126
we did sketch comedy.

00:06:29.126 --> 00:06:31.250
So I'll back up, I'll tell
you a bit of that story.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.179
So as actors,
magician, director,

00:06:34.179 --> 00:06:35.720
we had these creative
outlets, but we

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.632
didn't want to be struggling
talent, struggling artists.

00:06:38.632 --> 00:06:40.590
And so what we-- yeah,
that's the biggest trick

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.050
he has is his thumb trick.

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.300
Anyway, so what we wanted
to do is make some money,

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.220
so we can make our own films,
and do our own endeavors,

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.010
and not have to worry
about being penny-to-penny.

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:49.940
And we heard real estate was
a great way to make money.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.140
So, at the time, we were
in Canada-- at the time,

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.200
we heard the Calgary
market was really booming.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.890
So we moved, when we
graduated high school.

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:58.015
First of all, we read every
book we possibly could,

00:06:58.015 --> 00:06:59.370
every VHS tape we could get.

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:00.374
I'm dating myself.

00:07:00.374 --> 00:07:01.790
For you guys at
Google-- you don't

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:08.850
know-- a VHS is a thick DVD,
which is a-- never mind.

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:10.364
Anyway, so yeah,
we got every bit

00:07:10.364 --> 00:07:12.030
of information, those
late infomercials,

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:13.130
and then we learned
what we could.

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:14.780
We bought our first place
right out of high school.

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:15.852
It was a $200,000 house.

00:07:15.852 --> 00:07:18.435
We used creative financing and
got it for a $250 down payment.

00:07:18.435 --> 00:07:19.460
ALAN SEALES: You were
18 when you did this.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:20.290
DREW SCOTT: At 18.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:21.916
Yeah, and then we
did a lit-- actually,

00:07:21.916 --> 00:07:23.165
barely anything to that house.

00:07:23.165 --> 00:07:24.480
We barely renovated the place.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.467
We sold it after a
year for a $50k profit,

00:07:26.467 --> 00:07:28.300
and we thought, OK, we
can start to do this.

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:29.600
So we continue, continue.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.016
Eventually, friends
were asking us

00:07:31.016 --> 00:07:33.810
to invest and help them
renovate some houses for them.

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:35.250
So that's when we thought,
let's be professional.

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:35.890
JONATHAN SCOTT: That
was the biggest thing

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:37.630
that we discovered
is, most people have

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.370
a very tunnel vision
view-- and it's

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:41.400
because it's been
drummed into their mind--

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.540
a very tunnel vision
view about how

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.460
you can invest in real estate,
how you can buy real estate.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.210
Some people don't want to
have a bunch of real estate,

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:47.751
they just want to
own their own home.

00:07:47.751 --> 00:07:51.390
And some people want to be the
next mogul of-- real estate

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:52.140
mogul of New York.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:53.330
DREW SCOTT: They want to
be (TRUMP VOICE) huge.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:53.740
JONATHAN SCOTT: Yeah.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:54.445
They want to be huge.

00:07:54.445 --> 00:07:55.760
DREW SCOTT: (TRUMP VOICE)
Huge with their real estate.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:56.735
ALAN SEALES: Key
political point.

00:07:56.735 --> 00:07:57.610
JONATHAN SCOTT: So
that's what we said is,

00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:59.344
it's about looking
outside the box.

00:07:59.344 --> 00:08:00.760
There are government
programs that

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.380
can offer you grants and
things toward renovations.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:04.896
There are programs,
as well, that

00:08:04.896 --> 00:08:06.270
will make it easier
to get a home

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:07.580
and to get approved
for financing.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:08.550
So that's what we did.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:10.300
We found the ability
to assume a mor--

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.800
you used to be able to assume
a mortgage without qualifying.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.170
So if somebody couldn't
afford to pay their mortgage--

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:16.128
DREW SCOTT: Very smart.

00:08:16.128 --> 00:08:18.990
Two, just out of high school--
two full-time students

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:20.560
buying a house for $250.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.910
Nothing could go wrong.

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:22.800
JONATHAN SCOTT: Yeah.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.490
JONATHAN SCOTT: So
we were fortunate.

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:24.280
You can't do that anymore.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.113
But we were fortunate
that we put the effort

00:08:26.113 --> 00:08:28.790
into looking at all of our
options, and it paid off.

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:30.120
So the book is the same thing.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.400
It's about asking you--
it's about getting

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.964
you to ask the questions that
you need to ask yourself.

00:08:34.964 --> 00:08:36.880
Because, at the end of
the day, our philosophy

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.049
is that your home should
make your life easier.

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:42.020
So, you know, whether you--
say, you have four kids,

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.210
and you spend half your
life doing laundry.

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:46.340
Well, maybe it's worth
putting a little more money

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.048
into the laundry
facilities in your home,

00:08:48.048 --> 00:08:50.850
because who knew you could get
an extra-large capacity washer

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:53.900
and dryer that'll do a 15-minute
wash, 15-minute dry, done.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.660
Well, then you don't have to
spend the entire weekend doing

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:55.880
laundry.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.254
So there's all these little
things that-- I know this,

00:08:58.254 --> 00:09:00.170
and most contractors and
designers know this--

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:01.669
but the average
homeowner doesn't.

00:09:01.669 --> 00:09:02.460
ALAN SEALES: Mm-hm.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.940
So I want to go back to the
magician thing for a second.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:06.720
Because you keep saying that
and people keep giggling.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.120
JONATHAN SCOTT: All right.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.578
ALAN SEALES: Like, I will come
back to the homeowner stuff,

00:09:09.578 --> 00:09:11.670
but I'm going to
talk about-- you're

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.127
an actual certified magician.

00:09:13.127 --> 00:09:14.210
JONATHAN SCOTT: Certified.

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:14.470
ALAN SEALES: "Certified."

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:14.730
DREW SCOTT: Yes.

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:16.290
DREW SCOTT: You went
to a magic school.

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:17.080
JONATHAN SCOTT: I have
a degree in magicianing.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:17.852
I don't know.

00:09:17.852 --> 00:09:19.060
ALAN SEALES: Magicianography?

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:20.518
JONATHAN SCOTT:
Yes, so I started--

00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:23.110
we actually both started when
we were eight years old--

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:23.660
DREW SCOTT: Six or seven.

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:24.493
JONATHAN SCOTT: Yes.

00:09:24.493 --> 00:09:27.137
Seven years old, we
were apprentice clowns.

00:09:27.137 --> 00:09:27.970
And I'm not kidding.

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:28.880
So we actually--

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.463
ALAN SEALES: That
was not in the book.

00:09:30.463 --> 00:09:31.330
JONATHAN SCOTT: No,
it's not in the book.

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:33.260
So, we were actually--
we were overachievers

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:34.051
since we were born.

00:09:34.051 --> 00:09:36.670
And so our dad said to us,
you're seven years old.

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:37.720
Get a job.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.985
So I remember looking through
the paper with my dad.

00:09:39.985 --> 00:09:40.490
DREW SCOTT: Literally.

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:42.823
JONATHAN SCOTT: And there was
a wanted thing that people

00:09:42.823 --> 00:09:43.880
to go to clown school.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.020
At parks and rec, they
had, like, a clown program.

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.889
And then, after that,
when you were "certified,"

00:09:48.889 --> 00:09:51.180
they would put you out for
parades and stuff like that.

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:53.110
So we were these two
kids-- tall, gangly kids.

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:54.130
When you have the
makeup on, nobody

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:55.171
can tell how old you are.

00:09:55.171 --> 00:09:57.942
And we got hired do parades,
and birthday parties,

00:09:57.942 --> 00:09:58.900
and all kinds of stuff.

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:01.524
By the time we were 12, we were
making, like, $50 bucks an hour

00:10:01.524 --> 00:10:03.400
doing a couple birthday
parties a weekend.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:04.540
DREW SCOTT: Yeah,
one here, one there.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:05.980
But it was pretty good for us.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.060
It was a fun outlet.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:07.980
My parents were like, do it.

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.760
Because they're so
energetic at home,

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.040
they need a release so
that they're just tired

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:11.970
and they go to sleep
when they come home.

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:12.780
JONATHAN SCOTT: So
that's what-- when

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.020
we started doing more and
more of that, I continued.

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.715
Drew kind of moved
away from that

00:10:16.715 --> 00:10:18.000
and started getting
obsessed with basketball.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:18.390
He was obsessed--

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:19.460
DREW SCOTT: Let me just
point out one thing.

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:20.293
This is what I said.

00:10:20.293 --> 00:10:22.980
Jonathan, you're going to
live a life as a magician

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.665
and never have a
date in your life.

00:10:24.665 --> 00:10:26.430
If you ever want to
meet a girl, you're

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:27.960
not going to meet them at
your little nerdy clubs

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.130
when you get together
with other magicians.

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:29.505
JONATHAN SCOTT: However--

00:10:29.505 --> 00:10:29.880
DREW SCOTT: Then--

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.005
JONATHAN SCOTT: Then we
would be at, like, a party,

00:10:32.005 --> 00:10:35.019
and I had this circle of
girls around me in high school

00:10:35.019 --> 00:10:36.560
doing magic, and
Drew would be, like,

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.240
dribbling a basketball
by himself in the corner.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.470
DREW SCOTT: Look what I can do.

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:40.680
JONATHAN SCOTT: But, anyway.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:41.300
So, anyway, yeah.

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:42.780
So the magic-- I
started doing that.

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.600
And also, like, doing
the clowning and stuff,

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.891
I didn't like putting on all
the makeup and everything.

00:10:46.891 --> 00:10:48.810
So I stopped doing
drag, as well,

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:50.894
and then I just decided
magic was the way to go.

00:10:50.894 --> 00:10:53.060
So I wanted to be, like,
the next David Copperfield.

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.160
And I'd won all these
awards performing

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.900
and did big, big,
Vegas-style shows.

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:57.520
DREW SCOTT: He was
ranked third-best--

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:57.600
JONATHAN SCOTT: I'll do it.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.730
Here, I'll do something
right now, actually.

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:00.230
Everybody-- if I
can see your hands.

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:02.604
It's bright up here, but if
everyone puts their hands up,

00:11:02.604 --> 00:11:04.310
like this, so I
can see your hands.

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:04.400
All right.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.110
And this is a tricky one.

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:05.901
You do it, as well.

00:11:05.901 --> 00:11:09.150
So now put your thumbs
down, like this,

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:11.367
and reach over-- so
right hand over left,

00:11:11.367 --> 00:11:13.700
interlinking your thumbs--
and make sure that your-- no,

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:16.070
your right-hand pinkie
is over top, on the top.

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:17.096
So just watch closely.

00:11:17.096 --> 00:11:18.970
And then, just go like
this with your thumbs,

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:21.491
and just put your thumbs up.

00:11:21.491 --> 00:11:22.240
ALAN SEALES: What?

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.764
JONATHAN SCOTT: Give that a try.

00:11:23.764 --> 00:11:24.680
ALAN SEALES: I can't--

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:25.940
DREW SCOTT: That's weird.

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:27.580
JONATHAN SCOTT: But if I had
a picture of what you all look

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:28.410
like, right now.

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:29.160
DREW SCOTT: Witch!

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:29.620
JONATHAN SCOTT: Yeah.

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:30.470
So, anyway, no.

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:31.450
It's just fun stuff.

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:32.600
But I used to do, like,
the big Vegas show.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.310
ALAN SEALES: I'm going to
run this video in slow-mo

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:34.430
to figure out how to do that.

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:35.095
DREW SCOTT: Yeah.

00:11:35.095 --> 00:11:36.240
JONATHAN SCOTT: So
we just had fun.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.510
And so whatever it was,
performing, entertaining,

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:39.900
we were always outgoing.

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:41.983
DREW SCOTT: You know what
he's never done, though.

00:11:41.983 --> 00:11:44.510
You're a magician, and you
have an identical twin brother.

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:46.140
He's never used me in a trick.

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:46.640
Duh.

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.310
JONATHAN SCOTT: Maybe this
is the ultimate illusion.

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:50.470
ALAN SEALES: I was going
to ask if you had ever

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:52.170
done that dating,
but, obviously, not.

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:52.730
JONATHAN SCOTT: Well, we--

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:53.010
DREW SCOTT: Well, we done that.

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:53.792
Ask my girlfriend.

00:11:53.792 --> 00:11:55.250
JONATHAN SCOTT:
Yeah, we did have--

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:57.680
we dated identical twin girls
in high school, which got really

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:58.180
creepy.

00:11:58.180 --> 00:11:59.830
Because they were,
like, identical.

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:01.720
And then the four of us would
always be like, oh, wait.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.120
Are you?

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:02.230
DREW SCOTT: Who am I with?

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:02.460
JONATHAN SCOTT: Who am I?

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:03.430
Are we going?

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:04.120
Did we just?

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:04.745
Oh, never mind.

00:12:04.745 --> 00:12:06.453
So, it got too confusing,
so we broke up.

00:12:06.453 --> 00:12:08.710
DREW SCOTT: But actually,
and that's the thing, too.

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:10.235
In "Dream Home," it's
not just about the buying

00:12:10.235 --> 00:12:10.880
and selling and everything.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.730
We tell a bit of our story--
where things started,

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:13.688
where things came from.

00:12:13.688 --> 00:12:15.850
Because the reason a lot
of people enjoy the shows,

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:17.474
we don't take ourselves
very seriously.

00:12:17.474 --> 00:12:19.315
We have fun when
we do the shows.

00:12:19.315 --> 00:12:21.440
And we're trying to portray
that, as well, in here.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.315
Because, our whole life,
we've been laughing.

00:12:23.315 --> 00:12:24.820
On set, when we're
filming, I don't

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.070
know how we get any work done.

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:28.497
We spend all day laughing
with our crew and goofing off,

00:12:28.497 --> 00:12:30.080
but we somehow still
manage to still--

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:31.570
JONATHAN SCOTT: Has everybody
seen "Property Brothers"

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:32.249
before?

00:12:32.249 --> 00:12:33.540
Have you ever watched the show?

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:34.200
Oh, thank you.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.340
DREW SCOTT: Who has
no idea who we are?

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:36.075
Put up-- show of hands.

00:12:36.075 --> 00:12:36.890
JONATHAN SCOTT: Over there.

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:37.723
DREW SCOTT: Get out.

00:12:37.723 --> 00:12:39.500
Green shirt-- green shirt, out.

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.409
JONATHAN SCOTT: So we
laugh, because-- so,

00:12:41.409 --> 00:12:43.200
the homeowners come
on, and the homeowners,

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.384
they're generally
great-- generally.

00:12:45.384 --> 00:12:46.550
DREW SCOTT: Yeah, generally.

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:47.020
JONATHAN SCOTT:
But there's, like,

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:49.647
this one moment in time, where
every single homeowner-- and we

00:12:49.647 --> 00:12:50.980
don't tell them to say anything.

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:52.010
We don't instruct them.

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:54.440
We don't want to say this and--
we just film them as they are.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.950
And some of them, they
come out, at first,

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:57.630
and they're very stilted,
and they're like, oh, yes.

00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:58.512
I love this house.

00:12:58.512 --> 00:12:59.970
And we're like,
what are you doing?

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:00.572
Stop it.

00:13:00.572 --> 00:13:01.280
Just be yourself.

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.196
DREW SCOTT: Be normal.

00:13:02.196 --> 00:13:03.245
JONATHAN SCOTT: And I--

00:13:03.245 --> 00:13:04.930
DREW SCOTT: They're trying
to portray what they

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:06.090
think they should be on TV.

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:06.810
ALAN SEALES: They're acting.

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:07.250
DREW SCOTT: Yeah.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:07.410
Definitely.

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:08.610
JONATHAN SCOTT: And then
I'll say, be yourself.

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:09.250
There's no script.

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:11.720
And then, I'll say to them, I'm
like, you know, here's a house.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.095
Here's what we
could possibly do.

00:13:13.095 --> 00:13:15.550
And every single one of
them is always like, pfft,

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:16.840
you can't do that.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:17.820
DREW SCOTT: Oh, I'm going
to give you an example of--

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:19.270
JONATHAN SCOTT: Have you not
watched the frigging show?

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:20.774
What the hell is wrong with you?

00:13:20.774 --> 00:13:22.190
DREW SCOTT: Jonathan
quietly nods.

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:23.690
And if you watch
on the show, you'll

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:25.120
see he has a vein
on his forehead,

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.922
and it'll throb when he wants to
just throat-punch a homeowner.

00:13:27.922 --> 00:13:29.380
JONATHAN SCOTT: I
have never wanted

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:30.650
to throat-punch a homeowner.

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:31.480
DREW SCOTT: Yeah.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:31.810
JONATHAN SCOTT: Once.

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:34.470
DREW SCOTT: Anyway, but most
of the homeowners are great.

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:36.250
I mean, it's a lot
of information.

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:37.040
JONATHAN SCOTT: I can't see him.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.248
DREW SCOTT: This is our time.

00:13:38.248 --> 00:13:39.570
JONATHAN SCOTT: OK.

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:40.990
DREW SCOTT: Yeah, it's a
lot of information, obvi--

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:41.060
JONATHAN SCOTT: I'm
feeling left out.

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:42.100
DREW SCOTT: If you're buying,
selling, or renovating,

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:43.602
it's a big stressful area.

00:13:43.602 --> 00:13:45.560
JONATHAN SCOTT: So what's
happening, over here?

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:46.030
DREW SCOTT: Anyway.

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:47.571
ALAN SEALES: What
about the schedule?

00:13:47.571 --> 00:13:50.370
Because you talk about, you
have a very tight schedule

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:51.355
per episode, right?

00:13:51.355 --> 00:13:52.280
Is it eight weeks?

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:52.780
Or so?

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:54.040
So it depends on the show--

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.410
JONATHAN SCOTT: First of
all, I'd like to point out,

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:57.370
you should never start
a conversation going,

00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:59.930
you have a very tight, tight--

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:01.620
ALAN SEALES: Schedule.

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:02.210
Schedule.

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:02.770
JONATHAN SCOTT: Glutes.

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:03.660
DREW SCOTT: You noticed?

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:04.540
JONATHAN SCOTT:
Yeah, the schedule.

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:05.640
Yeah, it's back to back.

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:07.180
So we shoot four shows.

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.430
So we're nonstop all the time.

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:10.130
So we're just starting up
here in New York again.

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:11.910
We're going to be doing
mostly Westchester

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:12.890
and surrounding area.

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:13.320
DREW SCOTT: Yeah, yeah.

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:13.970
JONATHAN SCOTT:
Actually, all the way

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:15.460
from the Bronx, right
up to Connecticut.

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:17.846
ALAN SEALES: Listen, I applied
for this upcoming season,

00:14:17.846 --> 00:14:18.720
thank you, very much.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.615
And I got no call back.

00:14:20.615 --> 00:14:21.240
DREW SCOTT: Aw.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.500
Where were you looking?

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:23.025
ALAN SEALES:
Looking in Brooklyn.

00:14:23.025 --> 00:14:23.290
DREW SCOTT: Yeah.

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:24.540
JONATHAN SCOTT: I'll tell you.

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:26.570
There is a secret to
applying to the show.

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:28.424
You have to have
a different story.

00:14:28.424 --> 00:14:30.840
So it's always, like-- they
get a lot of people who apply.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.460
So I don't know what the story
is, but some people, they'll

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:35.040
go in and the application's
pretty straightforward.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.540
They look for the applications
where you're like,

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:40.069
all this info, and, oh, I'm--
are you a secret acrobat,

00:14:40.069 --> 00:14:40.610
or something?

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:41.151
I don't know.

00:14:41.151 --> 00:14:42.266
The whatever it is.

00:14:42.266 --> 00:14:44.140
They like people that
have a different story.

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:44.940
ALAN SEALES: No secret now.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:45.550
DREW SCOTT: But
that's the thing.

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:46.720
Some people who
just submit, saying,

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.010
I'm looking to buy a house.

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:49.510
Let me know if I
can be on the show.

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:50.790
Well, they want
to see your story.

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:52.290
They want to see,
like, a family--

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:54.665
JONATHAN SCOTT: They're like,
we don't want that asshole.

00:14:54.665 --> 00:14:55.224
Yeah.

00:14:55.224 --> 00:14:56.640
ALAN SEALES: Anyway,
the schedule.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:57.473
JONATHAN SCOTT: Yes.

00:14:57.473 --> 00:15:00.140
Yes, but it's-- the schedule
is out of control sometimes,

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:00.807
but we enjoy it.

00:15:00.807 --> 00:15:03.306
Because, you know, especially
when we do face-to-face stuff.

00:15:03.306 --> 00:15:05.450
I love answering questions
live and finding out

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:07.930
what our fans enjoy.

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:09.691
And also through
social media, that's

00:15:09.691 --> 00:15:10.940
a great way for us to connect.

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:12.510
We're the show-- the
one benefit of us

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:14.843
doing nonstop shows-- ten and
a half months of the year,

00:15:14.843 --> 00:15:18.020
we film-- is that we will take
feedback through social media,

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:18.900
daily.

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:20.510
And so we have a whole team
that monitors the feedback

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:21.520
and takes the feedback.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.790
And we will implement that
into our shows, the next day.

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:26.270
So, instead of a
lot of shows where

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:27.811
they wait until the
end of a season--

00:15:27.811 --> 00:15:29.780
they'll do an analy--
oh, OK, we analyzed this.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:31.070
This is what the change
will be for next season.

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:33.191
We literally are constantly
evolving the show.

00:15:33.191 --> 00:15:35.440
So if somebody messages
through social media and says,

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.856
I really want to
see an apartment,

00:15:36.856 --> 00:15:39.560
or I really want to see this and
that, we get it into the show.

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:39.890
DREW SCOTT: Mm-hm.

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:40.320
ALAN SEALES: Wow.

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.490
DREW SCOTT: Doesn't mean we're
going to come down and do

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:43.629
Manhattan apartments, yet.

00:15:43.629 --> 00:15:45.920
Logistically, that would be
a nightmare for production.

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:46.980
But maybe one day.

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:47.190
JONATHAN SCOTT: Yeah.

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:47.570
I don't know.

00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:48.778
Like, it so restrictive here.

00:15:48.778 --> 00:15:51.797
And the co-ops and stuff
here, it's like impossible.

00:15:51.797 --> 00:15:53.130
I've done a couple for the show.

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:55.870
I did a one that we had a
co-op that we had to deal with.

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:56.620
Oh, my gosh.

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.740
They'd given me the
wrong information.

00:15:58.740 --> 00:15:59.340
I'd submit.

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:00.720
They'd given me the
wrong information,

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:01.760
so I'd have to resubmit.

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:03.120
But they're not meeting
for another month,

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.050
so I have to wait another
month before I resubmit,

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:06.040
because of their mistake.

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:07.440
So it's very difficult
to do Manhattan.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.300
DREW SCOTT: It's
the cold shoulder.

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:09.725
It's the same in
his dating life.

00:16:09.725 --> 00:16:10.600
JONATHAN SCOTT: Yeah.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.720
You'll notice 90% of the humor
usually is at my expense--

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:14.070
DREW SCOTT: Dating
expense, yeah.

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:14.990
JONATHAN SCOTT:
--or my dating life.

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:15.830
ALAN SEALES: That's what
good brothers should

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:17.060
do for each other, right?

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.400
Um, actually, I should
get to my questions.

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:19.176
We've just been--

00:16:19.176 --> 00:16:21.890
JONATHAN SCOTT: Eh,
questions, shmestions.

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:23.040
ALAN SEALES: So, OK.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:23.670
Childhood.

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:26.619
Your first job-- I thought your
first job was painting fences,

00:16:26.619 --> 00:16:28.660
but apparently it was
clowning around, literally.

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:30.326
DREW SCOTT: No, it
wasn't even clowning.

00:16:30.326 --> 00:16:32.290
We had a job before that,
which he passed over.

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:34.564
So our very first
job aside from-- we

00:16:34.564 --> 00:16:36.230
worked-- we grew up
on a ranch, so yeah.

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:38.271
Painting and stuff we had
to do around the house.

00:16:38.271 --> 00:16:41.030
But our first job was we made
these decorative hangers.

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:42.780
We would weave nylon
around these hangers.

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:44.760
Because that was when my
dad said to us, get a job.

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:45.800
You're seven years old.

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.934
And so, we were making
the little nylon hangers

00:16:47.934 --> 00:16:48.850
with a little rosette.

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:49.980
It's like an arts
and crafts thing.

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:50.490
JONATHAN SCOTT:
Yeah, have you ever

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:52.073
been in your grandma's
closet, and she

00:16:52.073 --> 00:16:53.380
had those nylon hangers?

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:54.230
We made those.

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:55.090
DREW SCOTT: Yeah.

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:55.676
It was cute.

00:16:55.676 --> 00:16:57.717
And people thought, oh,
just two kids doing that.

00:16:57.717 --> 00:16:59.119
But we actually were go-getters.

00:16:59.119 --> 00:17:00.410
We were going to the neighbors.

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:02.250
We were finding people
to sell them to.

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:03.708
And we hooked up
with this lady who

00:17:03.708 --> 00:17:06.150
had a chain of American
paraphernalia stores in Japan.

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:07.880
She started buying
them by the thousands.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:08.569
ALAN SEALES: When
you were seven?

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:09.424
DREW SCOTT: We're
seven years old.

00:17:09.424 --> 00:17:09.750
JONATHAN SCOTT: Yep.

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:10.936
DREW SCOTT: So we started
hiring our older brother.

00:17:10.936 --> 00:17:13.144
JONATHAN SCOTT: We're watching
cartoons with hangers,

00:17:13.144 --> 00:17:15.826
and were weaving hangers, hiring
our friends and everything.

00:17:15.826 --> 00:17:17.200
That was our very
first business.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.616
And I even remember--
and this all

00:17:18.616 --> 00:17:20.530
sounds like we're so
full of it, but-- we

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:22.490
have the most
bizarre-- We should

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:23.460
be like 90 for the amount
of stuff that we've done.

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.095
But I remember that
at seven years old

00:17:25.095 --> 00:17:26.970
we went over to Scotland
to visit our family.

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:28.300
And my parents'
credit cards had all

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.440
been cut off, because the
bank thought, oh, fraud.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.360
Something's going on.

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:33.900
So my parents had to have
us, as the seven-year-olds,

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:37.040
float them for three days until
the new cards were delivered,

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.897
because our little
hanger business.

00:17:38.897 --> 00:17:41.480
DREW SCOTT: So Jonathan was just
out there, at seven, balling.

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:42.530
JONATHAN SCOTT:
Popping juice bottles.

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:42.995
Making it rain.

00:17:42.995 --> 00:17:43.270
ALAN SEALES: That's right.

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:43.839
That's right.

00:17:43.839 --> 00:17:45.630
So then, fast forward
a little bit, and you

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:46.960
guys grow up a little.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:47.460
So--

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:47.923
DREW SCOTT: Not much.

00:17:47.923 --> 00:17:48.386
JONATHAN SCOTT:
Not much, though.

00:17:48.386 --> 00:17:48.885
Yeah.

00:17:48.885 --> 00:17:50.900
ALAN SEALES: Well,
you get taller.

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:54.000
So at what point did one of you
decide to be the contractor,

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000
and one was the Realtor?

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.395
And did you ever, like,
consider any other combinations?

00:17:58.395 --> 00:17:59.770
JONATHAN SCOTT:
Well, most people

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:02.190
don't realize that Drew used to
do all the work with me, back

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:02.690
in the day.

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:05.204
When we first started,
while we were in college,

00:18:05.204 --> 00:18:05.870
he would get in.

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:08.539
He would do flooring, siding,
everything with me, no problem.

00:18:08.539 --> 00:18:10.830
And then, like, 1996, he
broke a nail, and it was done.

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:11.649
No more after that.

00:18:11.649 --> 00:18:13.440
DREW SCOTT: These were
made to be innocent.

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:13.810
JONATHAN SCOTT:
No, the funny thing

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:14.722
was-- so when we
started the property

00:18:14.722 --> 00:18:16.300
business-- we've been doing--
we started our real estate

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:16.710
company.

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:17.560
We had a lot of investments.

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:18.750
We were doing this
for, like, 10 years

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:20.200
before we were approached.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:23.020
And then, originally,
the network

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:25.780
asked for Drew to be the
contractor, because he

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:27.196
looked more rugged
and-- Drew used

00:18:27.196 --> 00:18:28.270
to look like a homeless person.

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:28.650
DREW SCOTT: I used
to do the renos.

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:29.640
JONATHAN SCOTT: It
was just all shaggy.

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.330
DREW SCOTT: Yeah, we had
the same longer hair.

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:32.954
If you remember season
1 Jonathan hair,

00:18:32.954 --> 00:18:34.500
like that lioness mane.

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:35.270
It was terrible.

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:36.450
I had long hair, as well.

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:36.780
JONATHAN SCOTT: We were awesome.

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:37.950
DREW SCOTT: And so they
thought I looked more brawny.

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:39.991
And he was the broker for
our real estate company

00:18:39.991 --> 00:18:40.550
at the time.

00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:42.250
So he had more real
estate designation than me

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:42.787
at the time.

00:18:42.787 --> 00:18:43.620
ALAN SEALES: Really?

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:44.430
DREW SCOTT: And so
they thought, you

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:45.721
can be the rugged hands-on guy.

00:18:45.721 --> 00:18:47.240
You can be the whatever.

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.030
And I was like--

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:48.610
ALAN SEALES: The whatever.

00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:49.630
DREW SCOTT: --this sucks.

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:51.463
Because I did not want
to be doing the dirty

00:18:51.463 --> 00:18:52.700
renos every single day.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:54.158
JONATHAN SCOTT: So
we were actually

00:18:54.158 --> 00:18:56.820
flying in to do the
test shoot for the show,

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:59.130
and, on our way
there, I was bragging.

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:01.250
I was like, I'm going to
have, like, Armani suits

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:02.180
and you name it.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:04.200
And then, they found
out that I'm actually

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.890
a licensed contractor,
and he is not.

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:08.917
And they were like, well, then
that could go terribly wrong.

00:19:08.917 --> 00:19:09.750
So they switched it.

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:12.610
Which, in reality, it could
not have worked the other way.

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:13.730
So we switched it.

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:15.720
And then, when we got
there, Drew walks in,

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:18.070
and he's got all
these suits lined up,

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:19.380
and the wardrobe was amazing.

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:21.120
And the woman says to me,
like, what do you think?

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.161
Is there-- pull anything
that's in your wardrobe.

00:19:23.161 --> 00:19:24.947
It was all Wal-Mart
denim and, like,

00:19:24.947 --> 00:19:26.030
flannel-- the whole thing.

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:26.590
DREW SCOTT: It was flannel--

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:26.935
JONATHAN SCOTT: I was like--

00:19:26.935 --> 00:19:28.560
DREW SCOTT: It was overalls,
flannel, and plaid.

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:29.910
That's all that was
in the wardrobes.

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:30.659
I'm like, suck it.

00:19:30.659 --> 00:19:34.160
Can I have the Armani shoes?

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.949
ALAN SEALES: So you were
talking about the audition

00:19:36.949 --> 00:19:37.990
and going to the network.

00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:40.100
But how did you even
get to that point?

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:42.340
DREW SCOTT: So we
had been doing--

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:44.341
we got away from acting
and all that side of it.

00:19:44.341 --> 00:19:46.840
And for about 10 years, right
out of high school-- 10 years,

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:48.610
our real estate
company had grown.

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:49.930
We had been doing pretty well.

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:51.540
ALAN SEALES: You were in
business as flippers-- house

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:51.790
flippers.

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:52.350
DREW SCOTT: Yeah, exactly.

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:52.710
Exactly.

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:54.030
JONATHAN SCOTT: And we were
working with clients, too.

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:54.620
DREW SCOTT: We did
work with clients.

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:54.950
JONATHAN SCOTT:
A lot of clients.

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:56.825
DREW SCOTT: But the big
thing, at that point,

00:19:56.825 --> 00:19:59.479
after the 10-year
mark, I realized acting

00:19:59.479 --> 00:20:00.770
was my true passion, directing.

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:01.853
I want to do more of that.

00:20:01.853 --> 00:20:04.850
And so I actually left
Calgary, where our company was,

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:07.340
and moved back to Vancouver
to pursue the creative side

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:08.370
of what I wanted to do.

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:09.490
The whole reason we
were doing real estate

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:10.860
was to fund that and whatever.

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:12.350
And so I started
doing a bit more

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:13.600
acting out there, auditioning.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.672
But I started getting more
host auditions because

00:20:15.672 --> 00:20:17.130
of my real estate
expertise, than I

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:18.720
was getting acting auditions.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:19.430
So I never thought about it.

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:20.875
At first, Jonathan and
I were both like, well,

00:20:20.875 --> 00:20:21.830
we don't want to be hosts.

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:22.360
That's lame.

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:24.197
We want to be actors,
because it's cool.

00:20:24.197 --> 00:20:26.030
And then, now that we
look back, we're like,

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:27.340
it just makes so
much sense for us.

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:28.910
We're sort of doing-- it's
a blend of our two goals.

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:29.060
JONATHAN SCOTT: OK.

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:31.600
He is yada-yadaing the funniest
part of the whole story.

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:34.559
The first big gig that we
were-- or, he was offered,

00:20:34.559 --> 00:20:36.100
rather-- was not
"Property Brothers."

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:39.190
The first show he was
pitched for as the host

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:40.970
was called "Realtor Idol."

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:42.470
It was "American
Idol" for Realtors.

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:44.386
DREW SCOTT: (SINGING)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:20:44.386 --> 00:20:47.290
JONATHAN SCOTT: It was the
dumbest idea I have ever heard.

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:47.910
And the show went no where.

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:48.670
DREW SCOTT: But I
have an awesome voice.

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:49.090
JONATHAN SCOTT: Yeah.

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:50.006
The show went nowhere.

00:20:50.006 --> 00:20:51.780
So then, after that,
the same producers

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:52.820
found out that he
had a brother that

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:54.590
was a designer a
contractor, and then

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:55.970
that's when they
approached us about doing

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:56.830
what we do with clients.

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:58.200
DREW SCOTT: So they
pitched us exactly what

00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.324
we were doing with clients.

00:20:59.324 --> 00:21:03.150
And, in the beginning, the funny
thing is HGTV turned it down.

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:05.400
At first, they had said, we
don't really see an appeal

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:06.608
with two brothers renovating.

00:21:06.608 --> 00:21:07.579
No.

00:21:07.579 --> 00:21:09.120
And then, HGTV Canada
turned it down.

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.100
It was a network
in Canada, called

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:12.200
W network, that said, OK.

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.075
We'll give it a shot.

00:21:13.075 --> 00:21:17.500
And within three weeks, we went
to number one of the night.

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:19.492
And then, within a matter
of weeks after that,

00:21:19.492 --> 00:21:21.200
we were number one
show on their network.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.070
And they were blown away.

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:23.570
So then HGTV was
like, let's just

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:25.070
try a half-hour
cut-down version.

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:25.980
Same thing.

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:27.355
And then a few
months after that,

00:21:27.355 --> 00:21:29.772
we've been top shows on the
HGTV for, like, six years.

00:21:29.772 --> 00:21:30.980
Thanks to you guys who watch.

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:31.420
JONATHAN SCOTT: Job security--

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:33.320
DREW SCOTT: Not green shirt,
sweater, over there-- no her.

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:34.490
But, everyone else.

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:35.670
So thank you, you guys.

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:37.920
ALAN SEALES: So do you ever
film more than one episode

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:38.419
at a time?

00:21:38.419 --> 00:21:39.200
Or is it--

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:39.280
DREW SCOTT: Always.

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:39.920
10 at a time.

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:40.200
ALAN SEALES: Really?

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.090
DREW SCOTT: We do
10 at a time, yeah.

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:41.920
JONATHAN SCOTT: So
that's what I have.

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:44.086
Like, all day, I'm just
between three or four sites,

00:21:44.086 --> 00:21:45.242
every single day.

00:21:45.242 --> 00:21:46.310
DREW SCOTT: Those grays,
they were not there

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:47.280
before shooting 10
episodes at a time.

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.690
JONATHAN SCOTT: Drew's got
the best job in the world.

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:50.402
Because, once the
construction starts on

00:21:50.402 --> 00:21:52.110
"Property Brothers--
Buying and Selling,"

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:53.760
he's not needed at that point.

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:57.280
So spas, golf-- if you've got
recommendations for panini

00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:57.780
places.

00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:58.640
DREW SCOTT: I love Winged Foot.

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.230
Just saying, here,
if anyone golfs.

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:01.920
JONATHAN SCOTT: But
then-- so that's

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:02.960
why I love "Brother
versus Brother."

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.770
Because when we're filming
"Brother versus Brother,"

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:05.620
I'm not helping him.

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:06.980
So he's got his own house.

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:08.080
He does his own design.

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.070
He gets in there and
does hands-on work.

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:12.250
So, obviously, it's comical.

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:13.499
But--

00:22:13.499 --> 00:22:15.040
DREW SCOTT: Actually,
the funny thing

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.390
is-- we joke about all the time.

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:18.431
But because, when we
started "Property Brothers,"

00:22:18.431 --> 00:22:19.900
we wanted to define the roles.

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:21.060
I think you brought
this up earlier.

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:22.620
We didn't want it just
to be a twin gimmick.

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:24.090
So, I actually cut
my hair shorter,

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:25.850
so we didn't look the same.

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:26.810
We defined our roles.

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:29.200
Even though Jonathan had
licensing as a real estate

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:30.910
agent, I used to do
the hands-on work.

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:32.840
That way, people aren't
confused who's who.

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:35.400
And when he's doing, he just
does dirtier work than I do.

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.189
We run multiple
companies together.

00:22:37.189 --> 00:22:39.230
I get to keep a suit on
and stay clean, while I'm

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:40.271
doing all the other work.

00:22:40.271 --> 00:22:41.735
So we work from
7:00 in the morning

00:22:41.735 --> 00:22:43.860
until 10:00 at night, pretty
well every single day.

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:44.890
JONATHAN SCOTT: The
most annoying part

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:47.050
is that-- because we're
working together all the time,

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:49.100
we've got all these businesses
on the go-- then we go home,

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:50.010
and we're in bunk beds.

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:50.560
So it's just--

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:51.670
DREW SCOTT: Yeah, it's tough.

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:53.240
JONATHAN SCOTT: You can never
get separated from each other.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:53.770
DREW SCOTT: I can
hear his texting.

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:54.610
ALAN SEALES: And your
feet's hanging off

00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:55.230
the end of the bed, yeah.

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:56.136
JONATHAN SCOTT: Exactly, right?

00:22:56.136 --> 00:22:58.177
DREW SCOTT: His sexting
is so annoying, when it--

00:22:58.177 --> 00:22:59.887
JONATHAN SCOTT: Oh, so weird.

00:22:59.887 --> 00:23:00.720
DREW SCOTT: Awkward.

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:01.680
ALAN SEALES: It's after 5:00 PM.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:01.770
It's OK.

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:02.976
JONATHAN SCOTT: Oh, yeah.

00:23:02.976 --> 00:23:04.710
ALAN SEALES: So, as the
viewer, in your episodes,

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:06.029
we only get to see a few rooms.

00:23:06.029 --> 00:23:07.320
Do you do the whole house, too?

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:08.040
Or, is it just like--

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:09.270
DREW SCOTT: We leave them
to sleep on the ground.

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:09.655
JONATHAN SCOTT: Yeah.

00:23:09.655 --> 00:23:10.040
ALAN SEALES: Really?

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:10.900
JONATHAN SCOTT: No,
they-- that's actually

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:12.660
probably the biggest question
we get-- what happens

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:13.951
to the other areas of the home?

00:23:13.951 --> 00:23:15.727
So, we only have
time to film three

00:23:15.727 --> 00:23:17.310
or four rooms for
"Property Brothers."

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:17.580
ALAN SEALES: For
"Property Brothers."

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:19.090
JONATHAN SCOTT: So the
budget and the timelines

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:20.464
are only for three
or four rooms.

00:23:20.464 --> 00:23:23.100
I'm not renovating an
entire house for $80,000.

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:25.880
We usually do renovate the
whole house, inside and out.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.030
But that's a separate
timeline, separate budget.

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:30.594
And keep in mind, too, that
we work with local trades

00:23:30.594 --> 00:23:31.760
in every city that we go to.

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:34.420
So, you know, I do the
design on all the properties.

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:35.130
And I jump in.

00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:36.730
And the tighter the budget
gets, the more I do,

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:38.410
because I don't
charge for my time.

00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:40.260
Drew charges triple.

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:41.680
So, you know, it all depends.

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.390
Every home is different.

00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:43.830
Some of the houses, they
don't need anything else

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:44.672
done anywhere else.

00:23:44.672 --> 00:23:47.130
Most of the houses, there's a
lot of work to do everywhere.

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:48.170
ALAN SEALES: Do they
keep the furniture?

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:48.500
JONATHAN SCOTT: Yep.

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:48.810
On "Property Brothers."

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:50.570
DREW SCOTT: On "Property
Brothers," it's all built in.

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:53.111
I mean, Jonathan tries to reuse
some of their current pieces,

00:23:53.111 --> 00:23:54.400
just refurbishing them.

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.612
But they keep it all.

00:23:55.612 --> 00:23:57.570
On "Buying and Selling,"
typically, they don't.

00:23:57.570 --> 00:23:59.195
Because we're staging
a house, so we're

00:23:59.195 --> 00:24:00.840
just renting furniture to stage.

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:01.520
ALAN SEALES: When
you said reuse,

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:02.960
I thought-- I was
picturing that you

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.470
went into the last
house you just finished.

00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:05.526
And you were like, let me
borrow this for a second,

00:24:05.526 --> 00:24:06.560
I want to put it--

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:07.815
JONATHAN SCOTT: We're going
to throw all this stuff out.

00:24:07.815 --> 00:24:08.430
Don't follow us.

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:08.910
ALAN SEALES: Don't worry.

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:09.410
Don't worry.

00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:13.300
JONATHAN SCOTT: No, I laugh,
because I'll take-- on average,

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:15.030
I'll usually be able
to reuse about 50%

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:16.566
of a homeowner's existing stuff.

00:24:16.566 --> 00:24:18.440
So, you know, they'll
come in for the reveal,

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:19.330
and they'll be like,
(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) oh,

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:20.250
my gosh, I love it.

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:21.510
This is so fantastic.

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:23.150
Why does that look so familiar?

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:24.830
But I'll have
re-painted the table,

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:26.900
or I'll re-upholster
a couch, or something.

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:27.650
And they don't recognize it.

00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:28.870
So, it goes to
show that you don't

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:30.078
have to throw everything out.

00:24:30.078 --> 00:24:31.400
You can reuse tons of stuff.

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:32.710
DREW SCOTT: It adds
character to a design.

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:33.030
JONATHAN SCOTT: Right.

00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:35.510
ALAN SEALES: So, shifting
back to the book, here.

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:36.140
DREW SCOTT: By the
way, can I say,

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:38.590
I love the fact that you've
already, like, ear-marked so

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:39.650
many pages, there.

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:40.030
ALAN SEALES: Oh, this was--

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:41.540
DREW SCOTT: That means you've
actually done some work.

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:42.460
ALAN SEALES: I read
the whole thing.

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:42.690
Yeah.

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:44.870
And, well, this is how I
put my questions together.

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:45.750
DREW SCOTT: Oh, thank you.

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:47.600
ALAN SEALES: So I just wrote
squiggly lines, and went back

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:48.180
and made things up--

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:48.980
JONATHAN SCOTT:
Because, until now,

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:50.146
we thought you were a fraud.

00:24:50.146 --> 00:24:51.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:52.550
ALAN SEALES: I get that a lot.

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:53.550
JONATHAN SCOTT: [LAUGHS]

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:57.450
ALAN SEALES: So the book--
like I said, very easy to read.

00:24:57.450 --> 00:24:59.410
I enjoyed the personal
stories as much

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:02.730
as the business
how-to's, I guess.

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:07.994
But you divided it up into
very specific sections.

00:25:07.994 --> 00:25:09.910
Like, how did you come
up with those sections?

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:11.710
Because it's like, "How
to find a contractor,"

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:12.430
"How to do the design."

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:14.030
I particularly liked
the outdoor space,

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:15.570
because you don't get to
go into that in the show.

00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:16.278
DREW SCOTT: Yeah.

00:25:16.278 --> 00:25:18.610
Well, that's actually
one of our favorite areas

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:21.070
is outdoor, for
making over a space.

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:23.840
Even with QVC, when we
launched our outdoor furniture

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.580
and decor, the reason
we started outdoor

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:26.780
is because it's
our favorite space.

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:28.930
Now we're doing our indoor
collections, as well.

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:30.051
But it was tough.

00:25:30.051 --> 00:25:31.550
Because we have so
much information.

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:33.840
From over the years, we
started mid- to late-90s.

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:36.330
And we've renovated,
we've bought, we've sold,

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:37.100
we've built new.

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:39.354
We've-- even if it's just
redesigning furniture,

00:25:39.354 --> 00:25:41.270
designing the space to
maximize what you have,

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:42.340
even if you don't own.

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:45.320
We wanted to find ways to give
something-- everybody something

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:46.290
that they could take
out of the book.

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:48.623
JONATHAN SCOTT: And for it
to be an easy resource guide.

00:25:48.623 --> 00:25:52.030
So that if I'm like, you know
what, I'm prepping my house

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:54.564
to sell-- boom, they go
straight to a chapter that says,

00:25:54.564 --> 00:25:55.730
"Prepping my house to sell."

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:57.146
Or, if they're
just saying, I just

00:25:57.146 --> 00:25:59.860
want to be inspired of what I
could do for the spring-- boom,

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:00.693
there's stuff on it.

00:26:00.693 --> 00:26:02.764
So that was the
biggest thing for us.

00:26:02.764 --> 00:26:03.680
I was actually amazed.

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:06.000
When we started researching,
that we wanted to write a book,

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.160
we wanted to research what
was already out there.

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:10.810
There was not one
single resource

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:12.594
for people that is
simple to inspire them

00:26:12.594 --> 00:26:15.010
about what they should do,
what questions they should ask.

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:17.317
So we compiled all
of our knowledge

00:26:17.317 --> 00:26:19.900
and researched even more stuff
that you haven't seen the show.

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:22.192
There's a lot-- I'd say,
three-quarters of the projects

00:26:22.192 --> 00:26:23.858
and the photography
in this book are not

00:26:23.858 --> 00:26:25.360
from houses you've
ever seen before.

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.000
They're other projects.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:26.160
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.040
There's lots of
pictures in here.

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:27.915
JONATHAN SCOTT: Yeah.

00:26:27.915 --> 00:26:29.799
And all of it was so it
was all in one place.

00:26:29.799 --> 00:26:32.090
So you don't have to have 50
books trying to figure out

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:33.230
how to reno your place.

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:35.480
DREW SCOTT: You realize,
Jonathan's talking right now,

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:36.890
so no one's looking at you.

00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:38.120
You're like, I want
to show you pictures.

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:40.206
And all the women in the crowd
are just like, (DREAMY VOICE)

00:26:40.206 --> 00:26:41.405
what's Jonathan saying?

00:26:41.405 --> 00:26:42.080
JONATHAN SCOTT: I wish.

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:42.820
DREW SCOTT: Sigh.

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:43.890
No-- we're going get--

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:44.790
ALAN SEALES: He gives
you compliments,

00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:45.830
but you are identical.

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:46.380
I just want to point that out.

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:47.130
JONATHAN SCOTT: We
have the same face.

00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:47.350
ALAN SEALES: Yes, yes.

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:48.050
DREW SCOTT: He has fancier hair.

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:48.250
ALAN SEALES: Yes, yes.

00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:48.550
DREW SCOTT: We're identical.

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:50.220
He has fancier hair.

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:51.990
He's had more dust in
construction sites,

00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:53.490
so this is now.

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:54.657
This is four years from now.

00:26:54.657 --> 00:26:55.531
JONATHAN SCOTT: Yeah.

00:26:55.531 --> 00:26:56.150
Anyway.

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:57.520
Sawdust-- actually,
it's not sawdust.

00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:58.370
I call it man glitter.

00:26:58.370 --> 00:26:58.840
DREW SCOTT: Yeah, yeah.

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:00.970
JONATHAN SCOTT: Man glitter is
really rough on the complexion.

00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:02.430
DREW SCOTT: No, but it--
that's really, honestly,

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:04.170
one of the things we
wanted there for the book

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:06.550
was to make sure that there
was a ton of information,

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:09.380
it was easy, accessible, a lot
of lists, and a lot of charts.

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:10.920
Even charts to
help you if you're

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.580
looking at getting products
for your house-- appliances,

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:15.954
flooring, outdoor
furniture, whatever it is.

00:27:15.954 --> 00:27:17.620
We're also listing
off what time of year

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:20.250
you'll get the best deals
from the different retailers.

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:20.490
ALAN SEALES: Oh, yeah.

00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:21.090
That was helpful.

00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:21.755
DREW SCOTT: Yeah, super helpful.

00:27:21.755 --> 00:27:22.485
JONATHAN SCOTT: Yeah,
the deals calendar.

00:27:22.485 --> 00:27:22.984
Yeah.

00:27:22.984 --> 00:27:25.125
There's even actual
floor plans that

00:27:25.125 --> 00:27:27.250
are common problems we find
a lot of clients bring,

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:29.430
so that you can see the
solution to that floor plan.

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:30.220
So.

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:31.967
ALAN SEALES: Something
earlier you said,

00:27:31.967 --> 00:27:33.800
what was the section
that jumped out to me--

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.160
there was something else that
I thought, when I read it,

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:38.850
I was like, oh, yeah, that
makes sense was you saying,

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:41.612
list your house lower than
you want to get money.

00:27:41.612 --> 00:27:42.320
DREW SCOTT: Yeah.

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.390
ALAN SEALES: List your house
lower than you want someone

00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:44.310
to make an offer for.

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:45.436
DREW SCOTT: So, well, yeah.

00:27:45.436 --> 00:27:46.893
The whole strategy
here-- and we've

00:27:46.893 --> 00:27:49.370
done this for many, many years--
is, if you think about it,

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:51.780
if you have, say, three
houses in your neighborhood

00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:53.170
that are pretty comparable.

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:56.580
And you price yours really high,
you're going to sell a house.

00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:58.400
It may not be yours,
but you're making

00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.050
the other houses look better.

00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:00.160
So what we've always done--
because, if you think

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:01.830
about it, if all the
houses are pretty similar,

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:03.310
but you're the top priced
one, well, then, obviously,

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:04.726
they'll say, why
would I pay more?

00:28:04.726 --> 00:28:06.410
I'll go to the more
inexpensive one.

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:10.440
So what we always do is we make
our houses the nicer house, out

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:11.850
of all the comparable
properties.

00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:13.640
We have them staged beautifully.

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:15.850
Buyers can see the
way they want to live.

00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:18.710
Yet, we price it just
under-- maybe 5% under market

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:20.210
value-- then, all
of a sudden, you

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:21.800
have all these other
houses that are blah.

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.800
Your house just under
that price that's amazing.

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.320
Everyone gets in a frenzy.

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:28.922
And we also delay our offer
acceptance, about a week.

00:28:28.922 --> 00:28:30.380
I usually will list
on a Wednesday,

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:32.380
and then I'll accept
offers on a Sunday.

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:34.070
People get in a frenzy
for about a week,

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:35.510
and then they all of
a sudden bring offers.

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:37.270
And we always end up
getting a higher bid.

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:38.960
JONATHAN SCOTT: Every
strategy is different.

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.110
And you look at
the neighborhoods,

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:41.985
and you look at the
community and the demand.

00:28:41.985 --> 00:28:45.390
But one of the things people ask
is like, I'll do an open house,

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:46.610
and that will really sell it.

00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:50.220
But, you know, I would say that
maybe less than 5% of our sales

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.757
have ever happened
from open houses.

00:28:51.757 --> 00:28:54.340
Open houses are actually just a
way for your real estate agent

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:55.280
to meet more clients.

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.800
That's actually what it is.

00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:00.020
So, unless you have
something very specific

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:02.320
that you need people to
see inside the house that

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.486
will sell them on the house,
that they wouldn't know

00:29:04.486 --> 00:29:06.180
from looking on the
outside, there's

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:07.790
not a huge value
on the open house.

00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:09.872
So we always say, don't make
that your only-- you know,

00:29:09.872 --> 00:29:10.740
some people will
say, well, I'm just

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:12.870
going to try the market
at a really high price,

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:15.300
and maybe there'll be
that one, you know,

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:17.170
dumb buyer right there
who's willing to pay.

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:18.070
That's not how it works.

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:19.580
You get-- it's like
your first date.

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:21.680
You get one crack at
a first impression.

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:24.444
And the challenge, too,
is, if you list high,

00:29:24.444 --> 00:29:25.860
and then you chase
the market down

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:27.401
as we go into the
fall and the winter

00:29:27.401 --> 00:29:29.395
when less people
are looking, what

00:29:29.395 --> 00:29:31.520
you could have got at a
higher price in the spring,

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.232
you will not get
in the wintertime.

00:29:33.232 --> 00:29:34.440
So there's a lot of strategy.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.040
Most people think it's very
simple to sell a house,

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:36.860
so I can do it myself.

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:38.160
There's actually
a lot of strategy

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:39.700
involved in trying to sell
it, and get the top dollar.

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:39.900
DREW SCOTT: Yeah.

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:40.775
ALAN SEALES: You were
saying, too, the little bit

00:29:40.775 --> 00:29:42.983
of behind the scenes, you
also talk about in the book

00:29:42.983 --> 00:29:45.110
is with the MLS system--
which, I don't even

00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:46.735
know how much that
applies in New York.

00:29:46.735 --> 00:29:48.830
It's all a big mess here.

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:50.932
That you only get to
be a new house, once.

00:29:50.932 --> 00:29:52.390
DREW SCOTT: Well,
that's really it.

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:54.560
I mean, what you'll see
a lot of agents will do

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:56.076
is they'll list a
house really high,

00:29:56.076 --> 00:29:57.700
they'll sit it on
the market for a bit,

00:29:57.700 --> 00:29:58.980
and then they'll start
to bring price down.

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:00.040
Others will list it high.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:02.040
They'll take it off the
market, and then they'll

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.920
re-list it as a new
listing at a lower price

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:06.420
to try and get that initial
pop, because that will show up.

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:09.000
People-- when you're on the
MLS, what a lot of people do

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.310
is they select what
they want to see.

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:14.342
If a house is listed without
photos, 99% of buyers

00:30:14.342 --> 00:30:16.050
don't want to see a
house without photos.

00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:17.760
So even if it's the
most beautiful house

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.634
at a great price, they
won't even look at it.

00:30:19.634 --> 00:30:20.640
They'll skip over it.

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:22.747
And even if you add photos
later, a lot of times

00:30:22.747 --> 00:30:24.580
they'll check not to
bother looking at that.

00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:25.050
JONATHAN SCOTT: And
that's something

00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:26.799
that's very hard for
people to understand.

00:30:26.799 --> 00:30:29.210
It's an auto-mail-out,
an auto-email,

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:31.710
that happens when you're
a buyer on the MLS.

00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:33.296
You set your
criteria, and as soon

00:30:33.296 --> 00:30:35.670
as something comes on the
market that fits your criteria,

00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:37.000
it auto-emails it to you.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:37.500
But, yeah.

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:38.917
Most buyers, they
won't look at it

00:30:38.917 --> 00:30:40.125
if it doesn't have a picture.

00:30:40.125 --> 00:30:41.766
So if your agent ever
says, well, we'll

00:30:41.766 --> 00:30:43.140
just get the
listing up, and then

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:45.380
when the photos are done in a
couple days, we'll load them.

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:45.880
No.

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:46.480
Do not do it.

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:47.840
DREW SCOTT: Or even if
you're reducing the price

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:49.340
a week or two down
the road, a lot

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:51.250
of times people will check off
they don't care about that.

00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:52.530
They want to see
only fresh listings.

00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:52.800
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:53.480
Right.

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.916
So, if anybody has any
questions for them,

00:30:55.916 --> 00:30:57.540
there are two mics
in the aisles, here.

00:30:57.540 --> 00:30:59.767
They can-- anything
is fair game?

00:30:59.767 --> 00:31:01.350
JONATHAN SCOTT:
Anything is fair game,

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:03.030
and we can hear you
wherever you are right.

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:03.250
ALAN SEALES: Well--

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:03.520
DREW SCOTT: Oh, here it is.

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:04.890
ALAN SEALES: It's being
recorded, so we need to.

00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:06.639
So, while people are
lining up, I actually

00:31:06.639 --> 00:31:11.040
want to get you guys going
here with some white boards.

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:13.470
We're going to play a version
of the "Newlywed Game."

00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:14.130
JONATHAN SCOTT: Oh, gosh.

00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:14.610
DREW SCOTT: We suck at this.

00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:17.000
JONATHAN SCOTT: I will point
out, we are the worst at this.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.710
ALAN SEALES: We'll call it
the Drewlywed Game or the--

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:19.050
JONATHAN SCOTT: You
would think that we

00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:20.779
would be able to read
each other's minds.

00:31:20.779 --> 00:31:21.242
ALAN SEALES: --the
Twinlywed Game?

00:31:21.242 --> 00:31:22.170
DREW SCOTT: Yeah, there we go.

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:22.530
ALAN SEALES: OK.

00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:24.170
So, we'll do some
easy ones, here.

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:25.860
So, in terms of
property value, what's

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:27.735
the worst thing someone
can do to their house

00:31:27.735 --> 00:31:28.851
when renovating to sell?

00:31:28.851 --> 00:31:29.934
JONATHAN SCOTT: All right.

00:31:29.934 --> 00:31:30.434
Um.

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:33.886
DREW SCOTT: All right.

00:31:33.886 --> 00:31:34.380
JONATHAN SCOTT: All right.

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:35.696
ALAN SEALES: One, two, three.

00:31:35.696 --> 00:31:36.820
JONATHAN SCOTT: Add a pool.

00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:38.982
DREW SCOTT: Yep.

00:31:38.982 --> 00:31:39.940
ALAN SEALES: Very good.

00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:40.720
JONATHAN SCOTT: Ha!

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:42.120
DREW SCOTT: I mean, a pool
is great, if you love a pool.

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.390
But, if you put in a pool
today, and try and sell

00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:46.200
it tomorrow-- like you're
putting it as a feature--

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.410
you'll never make
the money back.

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:47.910
JONATHAN SCOTT: Yeah.

00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:49.330
ALAN SEALES: So, what's the
worst thing you've seen?

00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:51.100
Is it just a pool, or has
there been something, like, so

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:52.320
over the top that it sticks out?

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:53.070
JONATHAN SCOTT: Well, no.

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:54.270
One of things--
I can't stand it.

00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:55.765
And there have been
clients-- there

00:31:55.765 --> 00:31:57.470
are a lot of clients we
wouldn't take on if they weren't

00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:58.720
willing to work by our rules.

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:00.771
One is, you disclose
everything, and you're

00:32:00.771 --> 00:32:01.770
honest about everything.

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:03.978
We would have clients--
they'd be like, (GRUFF VOICE)

00:32:03.978 --> 00:32:07.274
well, so we may have had a mold
problem, but I painted over it,

00:32:07.274 --> 00:32:07.940
and it's hidden.

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:10.020
And I moved a piece of furniture
in front of the bad part.

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:10.360
And that's good.

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:12.609
DREW SCOTT: Or they'll dry
wall over foundation cracks

00:32:12.609 --> 00:32:13.210
and stuff.

00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:15.360
I even had-- I worked
up in Vancouver

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:17.800
as an agent for a long
time-- and in Vancouver, it's

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:21.240
like the North American capital
for grow ops in everyone's

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:22.040
basement and stuff.

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:22.355
ALAN SEALES:
(LAUGHING) Oh, right.

00:32:22.355 --> 00:32:23.580
DREW SCOTT: In this
one house, this guy

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:25.746
asked me to come and check
out his house to list it.

00:32:25.746 --> 00:32:27.980
And he had a door
locked in the basement.

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:30.542
And I saw signs
like the-- that you

00:32:30.542 --> 00:32:31.750
see for that sort of a thing.

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:32.380
He wouldn't open the door.

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:33.840
He said, oh, I
just lost the key.

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:35.910
That was where his grow op
was, and which I found out.

00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:37.451
I'm like, I'm not
listing your house,

00:32:37.451 --> 00:32:38.790
and I've reported your house.

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:40.010
ALAN SEALES: Which,
by the way, I

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:42.093
was looking back to
fact-check the magician thing.

00:32:42.093 --> 00:32:45.735
And "magician" is not in
your book's index, but--

00:32:45.735 --> 00:32:47.110
JONATHAN SCOTT:
Is "illusionist"?

00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:47.600
Did you look at "illusionist"?

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.970
ALAN SEALES: No,
magician is not in there,

00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:51.530
but grow op--
"marijuana grow op" is.

00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:52.290
DREW SCOTT: There you go.

00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:53.170
JONATHAN SCOTT: It is in there.

00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:54.336
DREW SCOTT: That's my magic.

00:32:54.336 --> 00:32:55.770
ALAN SEALES: So what we'll do--

00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:57.310
DREW SCOTT: Great
supplemental income-- oh, no.

00:32:57.310 --> 00:32:57.690
Never mind.

00:32:57.690 --> 00:32:58.140
Never mind.

00:32:58.140 --> 00:32:58.640
I never said that.

00:32:58.640 --> 00:32:59.530
ALAN SEALES: We'll
do one more question,

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:01.060
and then we'll take
an audience question.

00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:01.560
All right.

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:03.760
So, here.

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:07.476
Jonathan's dream home
number-one must-have feature is?

00:33:07.476 --> 00:33:09.350
JONATHAN SCOTT: My
feature in the dream home?

00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.960
DREW SCOTT: In his dream home?

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:10.890
ALAN SEALES: Yes, yes.

00:33:13.507 --> 00:33:14.590
JONATHAN SCOTT: All right.

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:15.030
ALAN SEALES: All right, ready?

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:16.030
JONATHAN SCOTT: I write
like a five-year-old

00:33:16.030 --> 00:33:17.860
with a broken hand, by the way.

00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:19.243
ALAN SEALES: One, two, three.

00:33:19.243 --> 00:33:20.368
JONATHAN SCOTT: What is it?

00:33:20.368 --> 00:33:20.854
ALAN SEALES: Aw.

00:33:20.854 --> 00:33:21.830
DREW SCOTT: Space for your dogs?

00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:22.510
JONATHAN SCOTT: Oh, water slide.

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:23.640
DREW SCOTT: Oh, you big jerk.

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:25.848
JONATHAN SCOTT: I shove my
dogs down the water slide.

00:33:25.848 --> 00:33:26.770
DREW SCOTT: You jerk.

00:33:26.770 --> 00:33:27.310
ALAN SEALES: All right.

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:28.195
JONATHAN SCOTT: I
do have two dogs.

00:33:28.195 --> 00:33:28.640
So, yeah.

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:29.973
ALAN SEALES: Question over here.

00:33:29.973 --> 00:33:30.840
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:31.340
Hi, guys.

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:32.517
I'm from Toronto originally.

00:33:32.517 --> 00:33:33.600
JONATHAN SCOTT: All right.

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.360
AUDIENCE: And I love going
back to the first season

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:37.045
and watching just for
the nostalgia value.

00:33:37.045 --> 00:33:37.950
DREW SCOTT: Just
to hear, "Toronah."

00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:38.720
Or to hear the--

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.970
JONATHAN SCOTT: A lot more
people are like, "Oh, sori,

00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:43.040
I'd really like to see
aboot the new designs."

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:44.081
DREW SCOTT: The new hoos.

00:33:44.081 --> 00:33:44.990
That's a new hoos.

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:46.420
AUDIENCE: Well, so,
actually I was wondering,

00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:47.980
what do you find is
the biggest difference

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:49.670
between working in Canada
and working in the States?

00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:50.370
JONATHAN SCOTT: Oh.

00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:51.280
Oh, I will tell you.

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:52.626
So.

00:33:52.626 --> 00:33:53.334
DREW SCOTT: Wait.

00:33:53.334 --> 00:33:53.834
Hold up.

00:33:53.834 --> 00:33:56.520
What's the one stereotype that
you all think about Canadians?

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:57.232
AUDIENCE: Polite.

00:33:57.232 --> 00:33:58.940
JONATHAN SCOTT: They're
so polite, right?

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:00.148
DREW SCOTT: Not on this show.

00:34:00.148 --> 00:34:03.297
JONATHAN SCOTT: So we will
be filming in Toronto--

00:34:03.297 --> 00:34:05.630
so we film usually-- because
the production company that

00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:07.240
does "Property Brothers" is
based out of Toronto-- so we

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:09.440
usually do, like, every second
or third season up in Toronto

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:10.409
for a few months.

00:34:10.409 --> 00:34:11.691
Anyway, so, we'll do a house.

00:34:11.691 --> 00:34:13.690
And we'll say to the
homeowners, like, oh, we're

00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:14.830
doing all this work on
your house and everything.

00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:17.300
Maybe we could film with you
on, say, Tuesday and Friday

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:18.230
at 2:00 o'clock.

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:20.150
And they'll be like, nah.

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:25.040
And we're like, oh, well, we're
giving you $10,000 and $40,000

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:27.592
in free stuff, and it would
be great if we could-- Nah.

00:34:27.592 --> 00:34:30.050
But if we're filming in the
States, they're like, oh, yeah.

00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:30.790
I'll quit my job.

00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:32.123
I'll pull my kids out of school.

00:34:32.123 --> 00:34:33.873
No problem, everything,
whatever you want.

00:34:33.873 --> 00:34:36.039
DREW SCOTT: I think it's
less about the polite side,

00:34:36.039 --> 00:34:38.130
and it's more about in
the US they'll do anything

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:40.016
to be on TV, kind of thing.

00:34:40.016 --> 00:34:41.310
Anyways, it is fun, though.

00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:43.750
We love mixing it up
between cities across the US

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:44.659
and across Canada.

00:34:44.659 --> 00:34:47.610
And we do-- we're going up to
Toronto again later this year.

00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:48.490
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:34:48.490 --> 00:34:48.980
JONATHAN SCOTT: Thank you.

00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:50.659
ALAN SEALES: Question over here.

00:34:50.659 --> 00:34:51.650
AUDIENCE: Hey, guys.

00:34:51.650 --> 00:34:53.092
I work in sales at Google.

00:34:53.092 --> 00:34:54.800
And one of my favorite
parts of the show,

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.580
I think is really
underrated, is--

00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:58.759
it always typically
happens like this--

00:34:58.759 --> 00:34:59.800
go to see a house, right?

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.600
And they go, oh, it's
listed at, like, $560,000,

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:02.200
and then Drew come in.

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:04.390
And he goes, well, I think the
market value's about $520,000.

00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:06.160
And the next thing you know,
you put in the offer, you

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.122
get it at $520,000.

00:35:07.122 --> 00:35:08.330
And it, like, always happens.

00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:09.470
So what I'd like
to really know is--

00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:09.660
JONATHAN SCOTT: Miracle worker.

00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:10.445
DREW SCOTT: Yeah.

00:35:10.445 --> 00:35:12.934
AUDIENCE: I'm giving you a big
compliment, here, but-- one,

00:35:12.934 --> 00:35:14.100
how do you know the markets?

00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:15.808
And you go to all
these different places.

00:35:15.808 --> 00:35:17.320
And then, two, just
giving a context

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:18.920
on how you actually go through
the negotiation process.

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:19.240
DREW SCOTT: So--

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:20.530
ALAN SEALES: And look at how our
sales guy dresses, by the way.

00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:21.410
JONATHAN SCOTT: Yeah,
and you know what?

00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:22.660
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:23.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:24.762
JONATHAN SCOTT: Sale are
rough these days, huh?

00:35:24.762 --> 00:35:25.120
Yeah.

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:26.130
DREW SCOTT: Actually,
I love the question,

00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:28.540
because one thing that annoys
me a little bit-- there's

00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:31.590
so much information that
we could show on our shows,

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:34.404
but we only have 42 minutes
with commercials and everything.

00:35:34.404 --> 00:35:36.070
We only have 42 minutes
to tell a story.

00:35:36.070 --> 00:35:38.620
And so, I don't always--
like, if a house

00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:40.900
is-- if the value of the
home is $520,000, well,

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:42.590
obviously, I go in a
little bit lower than that,

00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:44.350
unless I just want to
make a hard sale and say,

00:35:44.350 --> 00:35:45.330
this is as high as
we're going, we're

00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:46.600
going to come in at top price.

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:48.016
But sometimes we
don't get to show

00:35:48.016 --> 00:35:49.780
all of the back and
forth and everything.

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:52.090
We work with a team of
local agents, as well.

00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:53.751
It's pretty easy
for me to figure out

00:35:53.751 --> 00:35:55.500
market value on a
place, just because I've

00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:56.700
been doing this for so long.

00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:59.500
But I still always have
a team of local agents

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:01.259
who also work with
me, because they've

00:36:01.259 --> 00:36:02.300
been working that market.

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:02.770
JONATHAN SCOTT: And
it's the same with me

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:03.660
on the construction side.

00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:05.610
I don't know the local
amendments to the code.

00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:08.740
Every city has local amendments
the National Building Code.

00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:12.387
And so, I have local trades,
and we come about three months

00:36:12.387 --> 00:36:14.470
ahead of time to start
finding real estate agents,

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:16.880
find trades who set the
bar high like we do.

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:20.004
And the other big thing, too,
is, when I finish a renovation,

00:36:20.004 --> 00:36:21.420
and I leave, I
want there to still

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:23.070
be a warranty on all
the work for the people

00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:23.790
that I'm leaving behind.

00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:25.750
So we make sure that we work
with local GCs, as well,

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:27.620
who provide the warranty
on everything that happens.

00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:28.400
ALAN SEALES: Nice.

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.510
JONATHAN SCOTT: We create about
100 local jobs in every city

00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:31.130
that we go to.

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:33.595
So it's nice to be able
to surge into the--

00:36:33.595 --> 00:36:34.845
DREW SCOTT: Beat that, Google.

00:36:34.845 --> 00:36:35.755
Oh, wait.

00:36:35.755 --> 00:36:37.120
JONATHAN SCOTT: Oh.

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:38.070
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:38.910
JONATHAN SCOTT: I
thought your question was

00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:40.790
going to be, like-- because
everyone's always like, oh,

00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:42.623
you know the part where
you, like, show them

00:36:42.623 --> 00:36:46.380
the perfect house, and you're
like, ha, you can't afford it!

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:47.870
I hate that part of the show.

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:48.330
DREW SCOTT: I love it.

00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:48.500
Love it.

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:49.440
JONATHAN SCOTT:
The nice thing is

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:50.820
it's getting hard
now to do that,

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:52.070
because most people
have seen the show.

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:53.300
But, when that
happens, you'll be

00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:55.320
amazed how people, like, paint
this picture-- even if they've

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:57.190
been looking for two years
in a space, they're like,

00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:59.230
oh, Drew found the
perfect spot I can afford.

00:36:59.230 --> 00:36:59.870
DREW SCOTT: They
literally think I've

00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:01.384
found that magical
one property that

00:37:01.384 --> 00:37:03.300
fits their budget, when
they've been searching

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:04.260
that neighborhood for years.

00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:04.520
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:05.800
JONATHAN SCOTT: He's got
the most maniacal laugh

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:06.420
when that happens.

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:08.628
DREW SCOTT: I have this
hairless cat that I pull out,

00:37:08.628 --> 00:37:09.936
and I just pet it. [EVIL LAUGH]

00:37:10.792 --> 00:37:11.750
ALAN SEALES: All right.

00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:14.083
So we'll do the flip
of the other question.

00:37:14.083 --> 00:37:14.810
DREW SCOTT: Oh.

00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:18.160
ALAN SEALES: Drew's dream home
number-one must-have feature

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:18.660
is?

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:20.390
DREW SCOTT: [LAUGHS] I don't
know if he'll get this.

00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.890
But--

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:22.060
JONATHAN SCOTT: Mm-hm.

00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:23.654
DREW SCOTT: My girlfriend.

00:37:23.654 --> 00:37:24.320
ALAN SEALES: Aw.

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:24.720
JONATHAN SCOTT: [GAGGING SOUND]

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:25.636
DREW SCOTT: All right.

00:37:25.636 --> 00:37:27.140
That's not what I'm
putting on here.

00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:27.640
All right.

00:37:30.099 --> 00:37:30.890
JONATHAN SCOTT: OK.

00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:31.480
ALAN SEALES: He's still writing.

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:31.780
DREW SCOTT: OK.

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:32.571
ALAN SEALES: Ready?

00:37:32.571 --> 00:37:33.640
And go.

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:34.640
DREW SCOTT: Huge closet.

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:34.900
ALAN SEALES: Oh.

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:35.420
JONATHAN SCOTT: Gigantic closet.

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:36.620
ALAN SEALES: There you go.

00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:38.274
JONATHAN SCOTT: I would
like to point out-- so, who

00:37:38.274 --> 00:37:39.450
saw "Property Brothers
at Home," when

00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:40.625
we renovated our home in Vegas?

00:37:40.625 --> 00:37:40.841
AUDIENCE: Woo!

00:37:40.841 --> 00:37:40.950
Woo!

00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:42.240
JONATHAN SCOTT: So we got all
the cool stuff-- the water

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:43.890
slide and stuff like that.

00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:45.599
No sooner did we finish
that renovation--

00:37:45.599 --> 00:37:47.764
so it was, like, June of
last year-- we finished it,

00:37:47.764 --> 00:37:49.575
and it was a huge,
biggest residential reno

00:37:49.575 --> 00:37:50.200
I've ever done.

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:50.870
It was so much.

00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:52.540
It was so exhausting.

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:54.735
Literally, two days when
we're done, Drew comes out

00:37:54.735 --> 00:37:56.860
of his room-- because we
sold our individual places

00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:58.990
and got one big, kind of
compound, there in Vegas--

00:37:58.990 --> 00:38:00.535
and comes out and
he's like, I want

00:38:00.535 --> 00:38:01.910
you to rip the
back of the garage

00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:03.660
out and give me a bigger closet.

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:07.224
And so, I had to sa-- so he
now has 180 pairs of shoes.

00:38:07.224 --> 00:38:08.140
DREW SCOTT: He added--

00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:08.890
JONATHAN SCOTT: I'm not kidding.

00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:10.250
DREW SCOTT: He added
17 feet onto my closet.

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:12.060
I took it from the
back of the garage.

00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:12.990
JONATHAN SCOTT: All shoe racks.

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:13.522
ALAN SEALES: That's the size
of some people's apartment

00:38:13.522 --> 00:38:14.070
in New York.

00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:14.350
DREW SCOTT: Yes.

00:38:14.350 --> 00:38:14.630
Yes.

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:15.370
JONATHAN SCOTT: I'm
not kidding you.

00:38:15.370 --> 00:38:15.780
It is.

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:16.840
His closet is ridiculous.

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:18.840
DREW SCOTT: I like
my men's fashion.

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:20.520
And some of it is
ladies fashion.

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:22.594
That's for Linda, not for me.

00:38:22.594 --> 00:38:23.510
ALAN SEALES: Question.

00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:24.260
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:25.740
So that rings true for me.

00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:27.895
I just closed on my first
apartment on Friday.

00:38:27.895 --> 00:38:28.650
DREW SCOTT: Congratulations.

00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:29.483
JONATHAN SCOTT: Yay.

00:38:29.483 --> 00:38:30.670
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:34.487
After 100 open
houses, so feel lucky

00:38:34.487 --> 00:38:35.820
that you weren't a part of that.

00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:40.380
But I'm leaving from here to
go meet my general contractor.

00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:42.510
And that raises two questions.

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:45.832
First, floor color--
what's your go-to.

00:38:45.832 --> 00:38:46.740
What do you pick?

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:50.680
And, two, given the limited
space we have in New York City,

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:54.160
would you recommend ripping out
a bathtub for a shower, if you

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:56.795
don't plan to put kids in
there, and it's smaller, so.

00:38:56.795 --> 00:38:59.170
JONATHAN SCOTT: Well, we only
have time for 40 questions.

00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:00.060
DREW SCOTT: Yeah, exactly.

00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:00.440
AUDIENCE: I'll just--

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:01.898
DREW SCOTT: One
thing I want to say

00:39:01.898 --> 00:39:04.069
is, I feel sorry for your
agent taking you to--

00:39:04.069 --> 00:39:05.110
AUDIENCE: I did it alone.

00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:05.525
DREW SCOTT: Oh,
you did it alone.

00:39:05.525 --> 00:39:05.940
OK.

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:06.300
Hoo!

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:07.020
100 open houses.

00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:07.310
Anyway--

00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:08.720
AUDIENCE: That's
why it took so long.

00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:09.910
DREW SCOTT: Don't say
to your contractor,

00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:11.510
Jonathan can do it for $50,000.

00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:12.310
Can you do it?

00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:13.362
They hate that.

00:39:13.362 --> 00:39:15.660
If you only have one
ba-- is it one bathroom?

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:17.370
AUDIENCE: It's one
full bath, one half.

00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:18.300
DREW SCOTT: Yeah, so.

00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:19.610
Oh, one full and one half.

00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:21.860
So, the one thing
that's a little tricky--

00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:23.510
you know, condo
living is different,

00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:25.350
because it's not as
much a family thing--

00:39:25.350 --> 00:39:26.766
but what I always
say, if you only

00:39:26.766 --> 00:39:29.300
had one bathroom in the house
with a tub, don't take it out.

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:30.760
Because now you're
eliminating any families

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:31.300
that would look at it.

00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:33.180
However, when you're
here in Manhattan,

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:34.346
it's a little bit different.

00:39:34.346 --> 00:39:36.130
Your typical market
is not just family.

00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:37.010
So you may be OK.

00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:38.750
JONATHAN SCOTT: Are you planning
to have children and keep

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:39.340
this condo?

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:40.190
AUDIENCE: No, not keep it.

00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:40.480
It's a condo.

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:41.860
We'll hold on to
it, but we'll never.

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:42.210
JONATHAN SCOTT: OK, yeah.

00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:43.596
Because that's the big thing.

00:39:43.596 --> 00:39:45.720
Buyers, even though they know
they could just renovate it

00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:46.520
back, they never do.

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:48.480
They'll just wash their hands
and move on to something.

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:50.290
Because, if you have
kids, you need a bathtub.

00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:50.793
ALAN SEALES: There's
a whole section

00:39:50.793 --> 00:39:52.340
in the book about
renovating to sell.

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:52.800
DREW SCOTT: Yes.

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:53.920
JONATHAN SCOTT:
Yeah, well, exactly.

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:54.090
ALAN SEALES: Yes, yeah.

00:39:54.090 --> 00:39:55.631
JONATHAN SCOTT: And
we had one client

00:39:55.631 --> 00:39:56.853
who fought me tooth and nail.

00:39:56.853 --> 00:39:59.340
And she was like, no, I'll
teach my kids to shower.

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:00.374
Her kids were like two--

00:40:00.374 --> 00:40:01.290
DREW SCOTT: Two, yeah.

00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:02.373
JONATHAN SCOTT: --and one.

00:40:02.373 --> 00:40:04.960
I was like, what the hell
are you talking about?

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:08.790
I'm picturing this one-foot
tall kid-- yeah, all right.

00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:10.890
Breastfeed me.

00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:13.470
So, anyway, that was
the first question.

00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:13.610
What was your other question?

00:40:13.610 --> 00:40:14.070
Oh, flooring.

00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:14.370
AUDIENCE: Flooring.

00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:16.170
JONATHAN SCOTT: So, I
love a mid-tone wood,

00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:18.445
like a beautiful
hand-scraped look.

00:40:18.445 --> 00:40:19.820
The nice thing
about hand-scraped

00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:22.620
is it will mask any scratches
that you get on there,

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:25.580
or if you have a dog
that sheds hair, as well.

00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:27.590
Having a mid-tone is
a lot easier to hide,

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:29.530
because dark floors
show everything.

00:40:29.530 --> 00:40:31.950
And light, light
floors show everything.

00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:33.190
So mid-tone is great.

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:35.130
But also, depending on yourself,
if you have a dog that's

00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:36.780
going to trash or
if you've got, like,

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:39.490
three kids, two dogs,
and four husbands,

00:40:39.490 --> 00:40:41.920
you want to make sure you'll
have flooring that will last.

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:44.570
So you can do vinyl
plank flooring.

00:40:44.570 --> 00:40:46.730
It is indistinguishable
from hard wood.

00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:47.670
I even fooled Drew.

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:49.540
He went down and felt it, and
he thought it was hardwood,

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:50.240
and it wasn't.

00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:51.180
It was vinyl plank flooring.

00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:52.638
DREW SCOTT: Tricks
me all the time.

00:40:52.638 --> 00:40:54.780
Or plank style in
your kitchen space,

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:57.731
or a porcelain-- plank
style porcelain also works.

00:40:57.731 --> 00:40:59.480
It's more durable than
a regular hardwood.

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:01.220
JONATHAN SCOTT: Well, we're
out of time for everybody else.

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:01.980
So, um.

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:02.480
Yeah.

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:03.826
Congrats on the new house.

00:41:03.826 --> 00:41:04.784
ALAN SEALES: All right.

00:41:04.784 --> 00:41:05.590
Whiteboard question, here.

00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:05.650
JONATHAN SCOTT: Oh, whiteboard.

00:41:05.650 --> 00:41:06.270
DREW SCOTT: All right.

00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:08.853
ALAN SEALES: If Jonathan had to
pick a new profession, nothing

00:41:08.853 --> 00:41:10.130
that he has ever done before--

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:11.130
DREW SCOTT: Nothing?

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:12.130
ALAN SEALES: --he would be a?

00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:13.150
JONATHAN SCOTT: Oh,
so not a magician.

00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:13.420
OK.

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:14.961
ALAN SEALES: Yes,
not a magician, not

00:41:14.961 --> 00:41:16.057
a water slide connoisseur.

00:41:16.057 --> 00:41:16.890
JONATHAN SCOTT: Huh.

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:18.736
Let's see here.

00:41:18.736 --> 00:41:19.610
DREW SCOTT: Oh, wait.

00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:20.650
JONATHAN SCOTT: How can you
answer this question faster

00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:20.810
than I can.

00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:21.740
DREW SCOTT: I was going
to say a smart ass,

00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:22.991
but he does that all the time.

00:41:22.991 --> 00:41:25.615
JONATHAN SCOTT: Well, I'll tell
you what I always wanted to be,

00:41:25.615 --> 00:41:26.220
and I never--

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:27.136
DREW SCOTT: Let's see.

00:41:27.136 --> 00:41:28.631
Hold on.

00:41:28.631 --> 00:41:30.539
This is probably not it.

00:41:30.539 --> 00:41:31.500
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:33.400
JONATHAN SCOTT: When
I was five years old

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:34.840
and got up in
front of the class,

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:35.840
and everyone was
telling the teacher,

00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:37.690
you know, oh, I want
to be a policeman,

00:41:37.690 --> 00:41:39.020
and I want to be a fireman.

00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:40.740
I got up in front of
everyone and said,

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:43.244
I want to be a flower man.

00:41:43.244 --> 00:41:44.910
I don't even know
what the hell that is.

00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:46.280
DREW SCOTT: Party planner.

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:48.267
ALAN SEALES: What
would a flower man do?

00:41:48.267 --> 00:41:49.600
DREW SCOTT: It's like a florist.

00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:49.890
JONATHAN SCOTT: I don't know.

00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:51.270
DREW SCOTT: But he thought
it was called a flower man.

00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:52.540
JONATHAN SCOTT: I remember as
a kid, my dad would walk me,

00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:54.490
like when it was Mother's Day
or whatever, he would walk in,

00:41:54.490 --> 00:41:55.940
take me with him to the
floral shop kind of a thing.

00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:58.420
And I always just thought,
they must love working in here.

00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:00.107
It smells so good.

00:42:00.107 --> 00:42:01.510
And I wanted to be a flower man.

00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:03.330
ALAN SEALES: Question.

00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:07.490
AUDIENCE: So, like Alan, I
also applied for this season.

00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:09.109
And I got a very fast response--

00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:10.150
JONATHAN SCOTT: Oh, ouch.

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:11.820
ALAN SEALES: Oh.

00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:14.640
AUDIENCE: --thanking me for
my fantastic application.

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:16.820
But the one stipulation
for this season

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:20.370
is that I was responsible
for finding the property.

00:42:20.370 --> 00:42:22.405
And so my husband and
I did consider it,

00:42:22.405 --> 00:42:24.620
and we did it a
pretty big search.

00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:26.640
But we kept coming
back to the fact

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:29.350
that we were a little concerned
about finding this property,

00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:32.747
not knowing if it was really
a good-- had good bones,

00:42:32.747 --> 00:42:34.080
or if it was really a tear down.

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:36.300
So we would love your
advice, because we

00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:37.680
will continue to search.

00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:37.990
JONATHAN SCOTT: Yeah.

00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:40.480
So that's-- so when we first
started "Property Brothers"--

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:42.140
so now we're everything
in three-month blocks,

00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:44.090
where we come in and we shoot
all of the shows in three

00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:45.000
months when we go.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.570
We first started
"Property Brothers,"

00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:49.070
we started with people before
they had even started looking.

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:50.030
They didn't know
what they wanted.

00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:51.010
They hadn't put any offers in.

00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:52.093
They hadn't done anything.

00:42:52.093 --> 00:42:55.910
And it was taking so long, and
a lot of them would get outbid,

00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:56.960
and everything going on.

00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:59.740
So we opened it up to people
who had already been searching

00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:02.620
and who mostly have identified
a house that they like.

00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:04.590
We still show them other houses.

00:43:04.590 --> 00:43:07.420
And, rarely, will they actually
switch and go to another house.

00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:09.170
Most of the time, it's
the house that they

00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:10.310
have found that they love.

00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:12.434
I can renovate any home,
absolutely any home,

00:43:12.434 --> 00:43:13.600
and I can make it beautiful.

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:14.308
But you're right.

00:43:14.308 --> 00:43:18.320
We had one client, who, against
every piece of information

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:21.235
I gave him and everything that--
oh, the other thing, too is,

00:43:21.235 --> 00:43:23.360
you'll be working with a
Realtor, your own Realtor,

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:25.943
when-- I always laugh, because,
when we come into the picture,

00:43:25.943 --> 00:43:28.380
your Realtor is always
like, can I at least

00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:31.345
get a-- can I get a
referral fee or something?

00:43:31.345 --> 00:43:33.720
And we're like, we don't take
you away from your Realtor.

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:35.370
We work with your
Realtor to make sure

00:43:35.370 --> 00:43:36.480
that everything comes together.

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:37.430
DREW SCOTT: At the
end of the day,

00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:39.720
I mean, the main thing for
us is we work with locals.

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:40.870
Whether you're already
with them, or we

00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:42.020
introduce you to other agents.

00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:43.436
Because outside
of us filming-- we

00:43:43.436 --> 00:43:44.730
do up to 10 episodes at a time.

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:46.840
I can't be out there showing
every single property.

00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:49.060
Jonathan can't be out there
on every single property.

00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:51.552
So we have real estate
agents working under me.

00:43:51.552 --> 00:43:53.260
We have construction
leads, design leads,

00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:54.409
that work under us.

00:43:54.409 --> 00:43:55.950
The big thing would
be-- it's getting

00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:57.491
you closer to that
point where you're

00:43:57.491 --> 00:43:58.940
ready to pull the trigger.

00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:00.950
JONATHAN SCOTT: And one of the
conditions you should always

00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:03.190
have, if you're doing a
major, major reno on a place,

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:06.170
is that you have a contractor
come in and price out the work

00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:06.840
and see.

00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:09.421
So usually, I recommend
getting a couple in.

00:44:09.421 --> 00:44:10.670
They don't charge for a quote.

00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:11.795
They'll come, and they'll
look at everything,

00:44:11.795 --> 00:44:12.210
and tell you what they think.

00:44:12.210 --> 00:44:13.932
If you see that the
numbers are way more

00:44:13.932 --> 00:44:15.640
than what you thought
it was going to be,

00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:18.140
you can walk away from the deal
without losing your deposit,

00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:18.807
and that's that.

00:44:18.807 --> 00:44:20.348
That's the challenge
with me, though,

00:44:20.348 --> 00:44:21.620
to come in as the designer.

00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:23.320
A lot of times, I
won't even meet you

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:25.389
until you've already
narrowed down your search

00:44:25.389 --> 00:44:26.430
and you've done all that.

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:28.760
So that's why you want to
have somebody that you know

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:30.350
has got you in the ballpark.

00:44:30.350 --> 00:44:32.990
I know I can make a house
beautiful, absolutely.

00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:35.200
And I get you all kinds of
free stuff, which is nice.

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:36.800
DREW SCOTT: And I also know
that he'll never stop talking.

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:38.110
JONATHAN SCOTT: I
never stopped talking.

00:44:38.110 --> 00:44:38.830
Yeah.

00:44:38.830 --> 00:44:39.645
So, anyway.

00:44:39.645 --> 00:44:40.270
That'd be cool.

00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:40.590
DREW SCOTT: Good luck
with the house hunt.

00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:40.860
JONATHAN SCOTT:
They still haven't

00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:43.492
fully-- I think there's, like,
four families left that they

00:44:43.492 --> 00:44:44.700
haven't finished casting yet.

00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:47.100
But like I was saying earlier,
find something unique,

00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:48.391
if you stay in touch with them.

00:44:48.391 --> 00:44:50.697
Because we've had it before
where people were told,

00:44:50.697 --> 00:44:52.280
no, and then all of
a sudden something

00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:53.080
happened, and it worked.

00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:53.900
Everything lined up.

00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:54.150
AUDIENCE: I know.

00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:54.690
That's perfect.

00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:55.690
We're still in the
consideration set.

00:44:55.690 --> 00:44:57.390
We just have to find the
property, so we're excited.

00:44:57.390 --> 00:44:57.680
JONATHAN SCOTT: Nice.

00:44:57.680 --> 00:44:58.295
Very exciting.

00:44:58.295 --> 00:44:59.670
DREW SCOTT: Good
luck, good luck.

00:44:59.670 --> 00:45:00.120
ALAN SEALES: Cool.

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:01.371
So, the flip of the question--

00:45:01.371 --> 00:45:02.328
JONATHAN SCOTT: Sucker.

00:45:02.328 --> 00:45:03.080
Oh.

00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:06.590
ALAN SEALES: Listen, my story
is that I've interviewed you.

00:45:06.590 --> 00:45:08.190
Does that not count
for something?

00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:10.252
DREW SCOTT: No,
they're like, hell, no.

00:45:10.252 --> 00:45:11.210
ALAN SEALES: All right.

00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:13.380
So if Drew had to pick a
new profession, nothing

00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:18.900
you've already done
so far, he would be a?

00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:21.099
Oh, one of you is left-handed,
the other one isn't?

00:45:21.099 --> 00:45:22.390
DREW SCOTT: I can go both ways.

00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:23.150
JONATHAN SCOTT:
I'm more creative.

00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:24.109
DREW SCOTT: Whoa, whoa.

00:45:24.109 --> 00:45:24.941
JONATHAN SCOTT: Hey.

00:45:24.941 --> 00:45:26.214
DREW SCOTT: Whoa, whoa.

00:45:26.214 --> 00:45:27.510
Are we talking about writing?

00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.940
ALAN SEALES: I work here.

00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:28.750
I can't say that.

00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:29.250
All right.

00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:29.720
Ready?

00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:30.010
JONATHAN SCOTT: Ready?

00:45:30.010 --> 00:45:31.750
ALAN SEALES: One, two, three.

00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:32.880
Spa analyst?

00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:33.601
DREW SCOTT: What?

00:45:33.601 --> 00:45:36.184
JONATHAN SCOTT: A spa analyst,
because he spends half his life

00:45:36.184 --> 00:45:37.840
at a spa.

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:38.590
What did you put?

00:45:38.590 --> 00:45:39.270
DREW SCOTT: Pro golfer.

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:40.490
JONATHAN SCOTT: Oh,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:41.854
He would totally want
to be a pro golfer.

00:45:41.854 --> 00:45:42.690
DREW SCOTT: Spa analyst?

00:45:42.690 --> 00:45:44.940
JONATHAN SCOTT: Here's a
little tidbit of information.

00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:50.350
So Drew is so
frigging competitive.

00:45:50.350 --> 00:45:52.420
He takes lessons for everything.

00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:55.330
So he take golf
lessons, guitar lessons,

00:45:55.330 --> 00:45:57.341
like-- he's taking
ping pong less--

00:45:57.341 --> 00:45:59.340
he's been taking ping
pong lessons for two years

00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:01.390
from a ping pong master,
so he can beat me.

00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:01.570
That's--

00:46:01.570 --> 00:46:02.880
DREW SCOTT: Has anybody
here been to Spin?

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:04.754
Anybody here been to
Spin, the ping pong bar?

00:46:04.754 --> 00:46:05.489
Isn't it awesome?

00:46:05.489 --> 00:46:07.030
Wouldn't you like
to just go in there

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:08.710
and crush those guys
that are in there?

00:46:08.710 --> 00:46:08.880
Yeah.

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:10.320
JONATHAN SCOTT: Because wouldn't
that get you so far in life?

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:11.190
DREW SCOTT: Yeah.

00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:11.690
Totally.

00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:13.020
JONATHAN SCOTT: He does.

00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:15.500
So when we did our
cruise-- our fan cruise

00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:18.747
in the fall-- I beat him
two tournaments in a row,

00:46:18.747 --> 00:46:20.830
and he-- I thought he was
going to jump overboard.

00:46:20.830 --> 00:46:21.850
He was so mad.

00:46:21.850 --> 00:46:23.100
DREW SCOTT: It was the paddle.

00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:24.240
It was the crappy paddle.

00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:25.830
JONATHAN SCOTT: If he
uses a crappy paddle,

00:46:25.830 --> 00:46:26.705
I can still beat him.

00:46:26.705 --> 00:46:28.400
But if he uses his fancy--

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:29.150
DREW SCOTT: Ninja.

00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:31.358
JONATHAN SCOTT: --$5,000
paddle, then he can beat me.

00:46:31.358 --> 00:46:32.940
DREW SCOTT: It is not $5,000.

00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:33.170
ALAN SEALES: $4,999.

00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:34.420
JONATHAN SCOTT: Yeah, exactly.

00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:37.319
DREW SCOTT: $180.

00:46:37.319 --> 00:46:37.860
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:38.910
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:40.500
So, I'm also an identical twin.

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:40.990
JONATHAN SCOTT: Yay.

00:46:40.990 --> 00:46:42.448
AUDIENCE: And a
dream of mine would

00:46:42.448 --> 00:46:44.670
be one day to go into
business with my twin sister.

00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:46.378
But I think we've been
a little hesitant,

00:46:46.378 --> 00:46:48.164
because I don't think,
you know, we don't

00:46:48.164 --> 00:46:48.520
want to drive each other crazy.

00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:50.186
DREW SCOTT: Is her
dream very different?

00:46:50.186 --> 00:46:51.510
JONATHAN SCOTT: Yeah.

00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:52.790
AUDIENCE: Well, that
could be one problem.

00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:54.248
But I wanted to
hear from you guys,

00:46:54.248 --> 00:46:56.470
what's kind of-- from both
of your perspectives--

00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:59.370
what's the best part about
working with your twin brother,

00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:00.650
and what's the worst part?

00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:05.672
DREW SCOTT: So, I would say the
best part-- he's [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:05.672 --> 00:47:07.690
ALAN SEALES: His eyes lit
up when you said that.

00:47:07.690 --> 00:47:09.190
DREW SCOTT: The
most important thing

00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:12.271
is to be able--
I love him a lot.

00:47:12.271 --> 00:47:14.270
The most important thing
is to separate emotion.

00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:15.800
Anytime you're doing
something in business--

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:17.300
this is why a lot of
families can't work together

00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:19.244
is because they're always
emotionally charged

00:47:19.244 --> 00:47:20.410
with whatever they're doing.

00:47:20.410 --> 00:47:22.451
This is also why homeowners--
we tell homeowners,

00:47:22.451 --> 00:47:23.550
don't list your own house.

00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:26.501
Don't try and GC, general
contract your own renovation.

00:47:26.501 --> 00:47:29.000
Bring in a professional, because
we don't have the emotions.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.410
So that's the biggest thing.

00:47:30.410 --> 00:47:32.172
We're good at that.

00:47:32.172 --> 00:47:32.672
Uh.

00:47:32.672 --> 00:47:33.156
Love you, bro.

00:47:33.156 --> 00:47:33.640
JONATHAN SCOTT: Yeah.

00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:34.765
ALAN SEALES: Love you, bro.

00:47:34.765 --> 00:47:36.880
DREW SCOTT: I would say
the worst thing is that,

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:37.530
when we're--

00:47:37.530 --> 00:47:39.720
JONATHAN SCOTT: Well, I
think the big thing-- Our

00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:40.900
no BS policy is a big thing.

00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:41.750
We have a no BS policy.

00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:43.300
We get it out before it
turns into something bad.

00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:44.580
But the best thing
is that, if you've

00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:46.850
had a best friend who you can
finish each other's sentences

00:47:46.850 --> 00:47:48.560
and all that stuff-- it's
like that times a hundred

00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:49.810
when you're an identical twin.

00:47:49.810 --> 00:47:52.120
So he knows what I
can do in a design.

00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:53.220
So people are always
like, (GOOFY VOICE) well,

00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:55.053
I'm not going to ask
Drew a design question,

00:47:55.053 --> 00:47:56.579
because Jonathan knows it.

00:47:56.579 --> 00:47:59.120
I went-- yeah, I went to college
for construction and design,

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:01.020
but he knows how to
design a nice house.

00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:03.480
So people-- we work
very well in the fact

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:05.230
that we know where to
share our resources.

00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:06.688
DREW SCOTT: What's
the worst thing?

00:48:06.688 --> 00:48:08.230
I would say the worst thing is--

00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:09.610
JONATHAN SCOTT: Drew is
a robot who will work--

00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:10.160
DREW SCOTT:
--third-wheeling on a date.

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:12.750
JONATHAN SCOTT: --24 hours
a day, always, everywhere.

00:48:12.750 --> 00:48:14.290
We were in Paris--
they would go,

00:48:14.290 --> 00:48:16.540
him and-- you're just as
bad, Linda, wherever the hell

00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:17.324
you are.

00:48:17.324 --> 00:48:19.490
They would go home at 8
o'clock every night in Paris

00:48:19.490 --> 00:48:20.640
and work on the computer.

00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:22.965
I'm like, we're in Paris.

00:48:22.965 --> 00:48:24.340
We're on top of
the Eiffel Tower,

00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:26.160
and he takes a conference call.

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:26.660
So--

00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:28.076
DREW SCOTT: Really
good reception.

00:48:28.076 --> 00:48:30.110
JONATHAN SCOTT: --that's
Drew's downside.

00:48:30.110 --> 00:48:31.040
DREW SCOTT: Yeah.

00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:31.360
ALAN SEALES: Cool.

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:31.610
Oh, yeah.

00:48:31.610 --> 00:48:31.810
Over here.

00:48:31.810 --> 00:48:32.893
JONATHAN SCOTT: Thank you.

00:48:32.893 --> 00:48:35.100
AUDIENCE: So your work
is impeccable, of course.

00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:37.654
JONATHAN SCOTT: Thank you.

00:48:37.654 --> 00:48:39.070
AUDIENCE: But I
imagine that there

00:48:39.070 --> 00:48:41.278
are some people who are a
little difficult to please.

00:48:41.278 --> 00:48:43.850
So I'm wondering
what's the least

00:48:43.850 --> 00:48:46.661
enthusiastic or unexpected
response you've ever gotten?

00:48:46.661 --> 00:48:48.160
DREW SCOTT: I have
one funny client.

00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:50.710
So this is actually from season
one of "Property Brothers."

00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:52.570
And I don't know
if you remember.

00:48:52.570 --> 00:48:55.240
He was a little short guy--
he was a little Asian guy--

00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:55.720
JONATHAN SCOTT: (COUGH
TALKING) Keiran.

00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:56.928
DREW SCOTT: --with gray hair.

00:48:56.928 --> 00:48:58.230
Do you guys remember?

00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:59.134
Kieran was his name.

00:48:59.134 --> 00:49:00.800
And I just found him
the funniest thing,

00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:03.420
because he thought he was
the guru of everything.

00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:06.120
He would come into Google
and tell all of your execs

00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:06.980
how to do their job.

00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:08.210
Like, that's just how he was.

00:49:08.210 --> 00:49:10.209
And so he was bragging
to Jonathan, (SMUG VOICE)

00:49:10.209 --> 00:49:12.120
I've been renovating
properties for years.

00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:13.060
And then he would
be pointing out

00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:15.101
something that is a very
generic feature that you

00:49:15.101 --> 00:49:16.360
put in a renovation property.

00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:16.980
And he was like,
(SMUG VOICE) I've

00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:18.646
never seen this
ridiculous thing before.

00:49:18.646 --> 00:49:19.546
What is this?

00:49:19.546 --> 00:49:22.170
He would follow Jonathan around
with a tape measure, literally,

00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:23.760
the entire renovation.

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:25.119
Measures this, measures that.

00:49:25.119 --> 00:49:26.660
He would measure
the dist-- he called

00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:28.205
it his splash radius
from the toilet,

00:49:28.205 --> 00:49:30.330
and he would measure the
splash radius to the sink.

00:49:30.330 --> 00:49:30.870
ALAN SEALES: Oh.

00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:32.280
DREW SCOTT: It was the
most annoying thing to see.

00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:33.630
JONATHAN SCOTT: He made me
reconfigure the whole bathroom

00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:35.590
because the splash
radius was within two

00:49:35.590 --> 00:49:37.226
inches of his allowable amount.

00:49:37.226 --> 00:49:38.060
So.

00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:40.310
ALAN SEALES: Did he take
personal height into account?

00:49:40.310 --> 00:49:41.510
JONATHAN SCOTT: Well,
I said, I'm like, dude,

00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:43.010
from your height,
there's no splash.

00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:45.090
You're in the toilet already.

00:49:45.090 --> 00:49:47.250
So, you know, just watch
that you don't dip in.

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:49.550
So.

00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:50.430
So, yeah.

00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:51.960
Yeah, you get people like
that that are know-it-alls.

00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:52.810
They're the ones
that are probably--

00:49:52.810 --> 00:49:55.350
But the only other thing, too,
is I appreciate that this is

00:49:55.350 --> 00:49:57.994
a crazy process, and it's--
the clients are paying

00:49:57.994 --> 00:50:00.160
for the majority of the
reno on "Property Brothers,"

00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:01.670
so that's why they
get so emotional.

00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:05.410
But the big thing is, if we
come across a problem that

00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:08.590
was hidden inside the walls--
and every major renovation

00:50:08.590 --> 00:50:09.900
will come across a problem.

00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:12.410
You hope it's something small
that your contingency covers.

00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:15.094
But, if we find something,
and the homeowner-- and this

00:50:15.094 --> 00:50:16.760
has happened on more
than one occasion--

00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:19.060
says to me, (GRUFF VOICE)
well, I'm not paying for it,

00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:20.090
but you better fix it.

00:50:20.090 --> 00:50:21.390
You found it.

00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:22.880
I'm like, it's your
frigging house.

00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:23.770
What are you talking about?

00:50:23.770 --> 00:50:24.220
DREW SCOTT: That's
not how it works.

00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:24.960
JONATHAN SCOTT:
It's not my house.

00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:25.460
Yeah.

00:50:25.460 --> 00:50:28.026
So I'm not going to leave
a property that's unsafe,

00:50:28.026 --> 00:50:29.400
but, at the same
time, homeowners

00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:31.635
have to realize that
you, as the homeowner,

00:50:31.635 --> 00:50:33.260
are responsible, at
the end of the day,

00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:34.290
for the safety of the home.

00:50:34.290 --> 00:50:35.740
And I want to make sure
that, you know, fix it.

00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:37.030
DREW SCOTT: We can't
quote on some job

00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:38.390
that we don't see
behind the walls.

00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:38.540
JONATHAN SCOTT: Right.

00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:39.330
DREW SCOTT: Yeah.

00:50:39.330 --> 00:50:39.685
JONATHAN SCOTT: Good question.

00:50:39.685 --> 00:50:40.936
AUDIENCE: Can I ask a
follow-up and just say,

00:50:40.936 --> 00:50:43.590
do you really make the people
remove the toilet bowls?

00:50:43.590 --> 00:50:44.110
JONATHAN SCOTT: Hell, yeah.

00:50:44.110 --> 00:50:44.390
DREW SCOTT: He does.

00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.630
Yeah.

00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:45.790
JONATHAN SCOTT: I'm not
touching your toilet.

00:50:45.790 --> 00:50:45.800
DREW SCOTT: Have you ever?

00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:46.600
Have you ever lifted a toilet?

00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:48.490
JONATHAN SCOTT: There was
one, I think one episode.

00:50:48.490 --> 00:50:50.180
So, my entire
career, I have always

00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:52.180
made the homeowners carry
out their own toilets.

00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:55.120
Because I'm not-- that's
not my goal in life is to--

00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:56.352
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:56.352 --> 00:50:57.560
DREW SCOTT: He made me do it.

00:50:57.560 --> 00:51:01.001
And all I did is, I did
the whole, I went, oh!

00:51:01.001 --> 00:51:03.500
And I did the pretend fall, and
I splashed him with the pee.

00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:04.320
Yeah.

00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:06.820
JONATHAN SCOTT: Sometimes you
just have to get the job done,

00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:08.932
so I'll dive in and
[WHISTLE] right in there.

00:51:08.932 --> 00:51:10.140
DREW SCOTT: Hand in that pee.

00:51:10.140 --> 00:51:11.598
ALAN SEALES: Dive
into that toilet.

00:51:11.598 --> 00:51:12.227
Yes, question.

00:51:12.227 --> 00:51:13.060
AUDIENCE: Hey, guys.

00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:14.399
I'm from a small town.

00:51:14.399 --> 00:51:15.690
DREW SCOTT: Hold on one second.

00:51:15.690 --> 00:51:15.870
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:18.250
DREW SCOTT: Can I point out
that you're blending style.

00:51:18.250 --> 00:51:20.772
You have a Drew-style blazer
and Jonathan-style shirt.

00:51:20.772 --> 00:51:21.730
AUDIENCE: This is not--

00:51:21.730 --> 00:51:22.750
DREW SCOTT: Thank
you for the support.

00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:24.249
AUDIENCE: This is
not unintentional.

00:51:24.249 --> 00:51:24.984
[LAUGHING]

00:51:27.290 --> 00:51:30.040
So, everyone in the
town that I'm from

00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:32.520
has decided that I look more
like the Property Brothers

00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:34.860
than anyone else in the town.

00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:37.840
And so, people feel
the need to tell me--

00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:40.910
JONATHAN SCOTT: Is the
town called Crazyville?

00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:41.480
Is it?

00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:42.410
What is the name of your town?

00:51:42.410 --> 00:51:42.960
DREW SCOTT: You have the hair.

00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:43.770
You've got the dark hair.

00:51:43.770 --> 00:51:44.110
I see it.

00:51:44.110 --> 00:51:44.790
JONATHAN SCOTT: Yeah.

00:51:44.790 --> 00:51:46.010
AUDIENCE: And so,
people come up--

00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:46.470
ALAN SEALES: You're
tall any male.

00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:47.920
AUDIENCE: --every time they
watch you, they're like,

00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:49.630
oh, we watched your
brothers last night--

00:51:49.630 --> 00:51:52.500
which is every night, all the
time, and everyone in the town.

00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:54.000
JONATHAN SCOTT: Can
you come up here

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.550
and ask your question from up
here, so we can take a selfie?

00:51:57.550 --> 00:52:00.279
I also-- I'm curious--

00:52:00.279 --> 00:52:01.695
DREW SCOTT: Come
on in the middle.

00:52:01.695 --> 00:52:02.625
ALAN SEALES: Here, here.

00:52:02.625 --> 00:52:03.555
Want me to take your phone?

00:52:03.555 --> 00:52:04.770
JONATHAN SCOTT:
Does your whole town

00:52:04.770 --> 00:52:06.630
think that all tall
white guys look the same?

00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:07.108
AUDIENCE: I think so.

00:52:07.108 --> 00:52:08.858
ALAN SEALES: Want me
to take your picture?

00:52:10.982 --> 00:52:12.440
JONATHAN SCOTT:
It's a racist town.

00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:13.930
All white guys look the same.

00:52:13.930 --> 00:52:14.800
ALAN SEALES: Something's
not happening here.

00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:15.782
AUDIENCE: It's the east coast.

00:52:15.782 --> 00:52:16.282
It's Canada.

00:52:16.282 --> 00:52:17.450
It's pretty--

00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:18.700
DREW SCOTT: You opened a chat.

00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:19.160
ALAN SEALES: Oh.

00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:19.290
All right.

00:52:19.290 --> 00:52:20.820
JONATHAN SCOTT: I've spent so
much-- I've spent a ton of time

00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:20.960
taking pictures.

00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:21.918
ALAN SEALES: All right.

00:52:21.918 --> 00:52:23.110
One, two, three, Google.

00:52:23.110 --> 00:52:23.990
All right.

00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:25.070
JONATHAN SCOTT: I almost reached
in again at the same time.

00:52:25.070 --> 00:52:25.530
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:52:25.530 --> 00:52:26.571
DREW SCOTT: Derek, enjoy.

00:52:26.571 --> 00:52:27.150
Sit.

00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:29.250
Yeah.

00:52:29.250 --> 00:52:31.806
ALAN SEALES: So, also we need
a video release from you,

00:52:31.806 --> 00:52:32.680
so don't go anywhere.

00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:33.854
AUDIENCE: No sweat.

00:52:33.854 --> 00:52:35.770
So I've had a lot of
time to think about this.

00:52:35.770 --> 00:52:39.400
And I'm just saying, what if
there was a long lost "Property

00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:40.360
Brothers" episode?

00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:43.790
Now, I don't know how
to fix anything, really.

00:52:43.790 --> 00:52:46.145
But I could be the
drunk one on the couch.

00:52:46.145 --> 00:52:47.020
JONATHAN SCOTT: Yeah.

00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:47.890
AUDIENCE: And kind of hucking--

00:52:47.890 --> 00:52:48.860
DREW SCOTT: Like
you are, right now.

00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:49.526
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:52:49.526 --> 00:52:50.700
Exactly.

00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:54.050
And so I would be your
biggest project yet--

00:52:54.050 --> 00:52:55.050
DREW SCOTT: I like this.

00:52:55.050 --> 00:52:56.466
AUDIENCE: --my
emotional problems.

00:52:56.466 --> 00:52:59.920
DREW SCOTT: So you'll be--
we'll call you Proppy.

00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:00.796
AUDIENCE: Proppy Bro.

00:53:00.796 --> 00:53:02.961
JONATHAN SCOTT: By the way,
did anyone see the SNL--

00:53:02.961 --> 00:53:05.220
was it the 30th anniversary
or 40th anniversary--

00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:06.200
DREW SCOTT: 40th anniversary.

00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:07.449
JONATHAN SCOTT: --celebration.

00:53:07.449 --> 00:53:09.222

sketch in New York.

What's the name of
the guy who does

00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:11.960
all of the club breakdowns?

00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:12.730
I can't remember.

00:53:12.730 --> 00:53:13.000
AUDIENCE: Stefon.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:13.450
JONATHAN SCOTT: What is it?

00:53:13.450 --> 00:53:13.850
DREW SCOTT: S--

00:53:13.850 --> 00:53:14.650

00:53:14.650 --> 00:53:15.050
AUDIENCE: Bill Hader.

00:53:15.050 --> 00:53:15.790
JONATHAN SCOTT: Stefan, yeah.

00:53:15.790 --> 00:53:17.581
And in that, Stefon's
like, (BREATHY VOICE)

00:53:17.581 --> 00:53:19.780
the club was designed by
the lesser-known Property

00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:20.910

00:53:20.910 --> 00:53:21.894
That was you!

00:53:21.894 --> 00:53:22.862
AUDIENCE: That was me.

00:53:22.862 --> 00:53:23.830
JONATHAN SCOTT:
Yeah, so that's cool.

00:53:23.830 --> 00:53:24.150
DREW SCOTT: You know what?

00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.610
Tell you what.

00:53:24.610 --> 00:53:26.140
We will have our
agent contact you.

00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:27.000
You don't contact them.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:27.635
We will have them--

00:53:27.635 --> 00:53:29.050
JONATHAN SCOTT: Yeah, we'll
have them reach out to you.

00:53:29.050 --> 00:53:29.883
Anyway, that's nice.

00:53:29.883 --> 00:53:32.270
I would say that half of
the tweets that we get

00:53:32.270 --> 00:53:34.970
are from people whose families
have outed them as a Property

00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:35.790
Brother lookalike.

00:53:35.790 --> 00:53:37.550
And so, at some point, we
need to start our own club

00:53:37.550 --> 00:53:38.760
or something like that.

00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:39.593

00:53:39.593 --> 00:53:42.926
DREW SCOTT: Thank you for
making yourself known to us.

00:53:42.926 --> 00:53:44.351
The other brother.

00:53:44.351 --> 00:53:45.850
Actually it is the
cutest thing when

00:53:45.850 --> 00:53:47.680
we have-- our fans
will have their kids,

00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:48.630
will post pictures,
when they want

00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:50.750
to be us for Halloween
or something like that.

00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:52.630
And they all fight
to be the contractor.

00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:54.080
Like, the kids all want
to be the contractor.

00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:54.695
ALAN SEALES: Wear the tool belt.

00:53:54.695 --> 00:53:56.491
DREW SCOTT: Come on, [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:56.491 --> 00:53:58.240
JONATHAN SCOTT: Snapchat
has a face filter

00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:00.850
that puts a beard,
like a goatee, on you.

00:54:00.850 --> 00:54:02.740
And everyone now looks like me.

00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:05.566
I had a 10-year-old send a
picture with the beard on now,

00:54:05.566 --> 00:54:06.440
and it looks like me.

00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:09.470
So apparently it's that Jonathan
filter on Snapchat right now.

00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:11.732
ALAN SEALES: You need to
have your Realtor toolbelt.

00:54:11.732 --> 00:54:12.440
DREW SCOTT: I do.

00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:12.740
I mean--

00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:13.470
ALAN SEALES: So it's pink.

00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:15.553
DREW SCOTT: I would say,
I don't need a tool belt,

00:54:15.553 --> 00:54:18.180
because I just carry a tool
around with me all the time.

00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:18.360
ALAN SEALES: Ba-dum-bump.

00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:19.510
DREW SCOTT: I'm sorry.

00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:20.218
ALAN SEALES: Yes.

00:54:20.218 --> 00:54:21.236
A question over here.

00:54:21.236 --> 00:54:21.630
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:54:21.630 --> 00:54:23.838
You mentioned that you're
currently not in Manhattan,

00:54:23.838 --> 00:54:25.990
or you have only done a
limited number of projects.

00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:28.542
So my question is
what are your--

00:54:28.542 --> 00:54:30.542
JONATHAN SCOTT: Will you
marry me, is that what?

00:54:30.542 --> 00:54:32.310
AUDIENCE: Oh, I'm
already married.

00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:35.760
But my question is what are your
reservations with Manhattan?

00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:38.480
Because Manhattan can be tricky.

00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:40.370
And, if there were,
hypothetically,

00:54:40.370 --> 00:54:43.430
were a rooftop project in
Harlem that needed to be redone,

00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:44.286
is that-- you know--

00:54:44.286 --> 00:54:45.410
DREW SCOTT: Hypothetically?

00:54:45.410 --> 00:54:46.780
AUDIENCE: --something you
would be interested in.

00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:47.900
DREW SCOTT: Well,
the main thing is,

00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:49.660
we always have to think about--
there is the real estate

00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:50.474
side of what we do.

00:54:50.474 --> 00:54:52.140
And we love hitting
all different cities

00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:55.400
to show the country-- the
diversity of properties

00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:56.320
across the country.

00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:58.070
But the other side is
the production side.

00:54:58.070 --> 00:54:59.660
We have to think logistically.

00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:02.509
Shooting in Manhattan
gets very, very expensive.

00:55:02.509 --> 00:55:05.050
Because think about parking for
crew vehicles and everything.

00:55:05.050 --> 00:55:08.250
Construction, if you're
dealing with downtown property,

00:55:08.250 --> 00:55:09.425
it gets really expensive.

00:55:09.425 --> 00:55:10.350
JONATHAN SCOTT: There's
timelines for permits.

00:55:10.350 --> 00:55:11.280
Co-ops turnaround.

00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:12.970
Co-ops have to approve
everything that you do,

00:55:12.970 --> 00:55:14.200
and they only meet once a month.

00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:15.550
So if you don't get
approval on this one,

00:55:15.550 --> 00:55:16.550
if there's anything wrong--

00:55:16.550 --> 00:55:16.930
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:16.930 --> 00:55:18.263
JONATHAN SCOTT: --a month later.

00:55:18.263 --> 00:55:20.635
So the problem that I
have is the timeline.

00:55:20.635 --> 00:55:22.760
Now, so if I have to be in
and out in three months,

00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:26.300
good luck renovating anything
in Manhattan in three months.

00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:28.320
And as far as a rooftop
patio, I actually

00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:30.370
just did a phenomenal
rooftop patio design

00:55:30.370 --> 00:55:31.979
here for an actor
friend of ours.

00:55:31.979 --> 00:55:34.270
And then he ended up selling
the place before I did it.

00:55:34.270 --> 00:55:37.944
So I have a finished
design for a rooftop patio.

00:55:37.944 --> 00:55:38.444
Just saying.

00:55:38.444 --> 00:55:39.938
DREW SCOTT: Rrrr.

00:55:39.938 --> 00:55:40.440
Is, uh--

00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:41.500
JONATHAN SCOTT:
Party at your place.

00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:43.625
DREW SCOTT: --that proposal
back on the table, now?

00:55:43.625 --> 00:55:46.041
JONATHAN SCOTT: That's the one
great thing with Manhattan.

00:55:46.041 --> 00:55:48.180
Any time you're working
with a smaller space,

00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:50.829
try and utilize your outdoor
living area for something

00:55:50.829 --> 00:55:52.370
that you can use
throughout the year.

00:55:52.370 --> 00:55:54.650
I mean, of course, in Vegas, we
can use an outdoor space right

00:55:54.650 --> 00:55:55.441
through the winter.

00:55:55.441 --> 00:55:57.990
Yours is a lot more limited,
but even in some of the designs,

00:55:57.990 --> 00:56:00.311
you could have a reduced
area with some coverage

00:56:00.311 --> 00:56:01.810
that'll allow to
keep the snow away.

00:56:01.810 --> 00:56:02.300
So.

00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:02.675
ALAN SEALES: Cool.

00:56:02.675 --> 00:56:03.340
DREW SCOTT: Yeah.

00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:03.520
JONATHAN SCOTT: Thank you.

00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:03.780
ALAN SEALES: All right.

00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:05.711
So we've got time for
one more question.

00:56:05.711 --> 00:56:06.210
Yeah?

00:56:06.210 --> 00:56:07.090
JONATHAN SCOTT:
No pressure, but.

00:56:07.090 --> 00:56:07.540
ALAN SEALES: No pressure.

00:56:07.540 --> 00:56:08.000
Better be good.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:09.400
JONATHAN SCOTT: By
the way, there's

00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:10.640
no such thing as
a stupid question.

00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:12.000
But if you do ask
a stupid question,

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:12.290
we'll make fun of you.

00:56:12.290 --> 00:56:12.780
AUDIENCE: You'll let me know.

00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:13.500
DREW SCOTT: Yeah,
we'll make fun of you.

00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:14.374
JONATHAN SCOTT: Yeah.

00:56:14.374 --> 00:56:15.382
AUDIENCE: Fair game.

00:56:15.382 --> 00:56:17.465
So you mentioned that
there's lots of differences,

00:56:17.465 --> 00:56:19.310
and different
markets and cities.

00:56:19.310 --> 00:56:21.700
And, as someone
who's potentially

00:56:21.700 --> 00:56:24.220
going to be a first-time
buyer in Westchester-- I live

00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:25.960
in the city with
my husband now--

00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:29.330
do you have any watch-outs,
call-outs that you would say

00:56:29.330 --> 00:56:31.146
are unique to Westchester?

00:56:31.146 --> 00:56:33.270
Now that you've been there--
both with the buy side

00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:34.070
and the reno side.

00:56:34.070 --> 00:56:34.400
DREW SCOTT: Can I swear?

00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:34.730
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:56:34.730 --> 00:56:35.981
DREW SCOTT: Old shitty houses.

00:56:35.981 --> 00:56:36.855
JONATHAN SCOTT: Yeah.

00:56:36.855 --> 00:56:38.860
DREW SCOTT: That's very
common in Westchester.

00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:39.810
JONATHAN SCOTT: Well,
the one thing that we did

00:56:39.810 --> 00:56:41.230
discover-- because
we-- so we shot

00:56:41.230 --> 00:56:43.550
for five months in Westchester
and actually all the way

00:56:43.550 --> 00:56:45.350
up to Connecticut--
but there are

00:56:45.350 --> 00:56:49.482
all these pockets with the
most bizarre codes that I

00:56:49.482 --> 00:56:50.190
have come across.

00:56:50.190 --> 00:56:52.660
The strangest
things that-- like,

00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:55.710
I have renovated houses across
the country, up in Canada,

00:56:55.710 --> 00:56:57.460
everywhere-- and
there will be, like,

00:56:57.460 --> 00:57:01.730
this little hamlet
in Westchester that

00:57:01.730 --> 00:57:03.720
has some random code
that, like, no you can't

00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:06.220
do this because of XYZ in the
code says you have to do this.

00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:09.980
So be aware that renovating
in Westchester was trickier.

00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:11.340
The permits were more expensive.

00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:12.214
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:12.214 --> 00:57:15.880
JONATHAN SCOTT: And they
would shut us down constantly

00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:18.910
if you were working a minute
past the time that you

00:57:18.910 --> 00:57:20.010
were allowed to work past.

00:57:20.010 --> 00:57:23.200
So in normal areas where I can
work until maybe 9:00 at night,

00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:25.180
10:00 at night,
sometimes, in Westchester

00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:27.315
it was something
crazy like 7 o'clock.

00:57:27.315 --> 00:57:29.940
DREW SCOTT: Sometimes, from one
county or one city to the next,

00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:34.470
the small tweaks to code is
so drastically different.

00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:35.790
And, as well, state to state.

00:57:35.790 --> 00:57:37.370
So just know it inside and out.

00:57:37.370 --> 00:57:38.882
Or hopefully if you're
working with a contractor that

00:57:38.882 --> 00:57:39.520
knows what they're doing.

00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:41.030
JONATHAN SCOTT: I also did
find that as soon as you tell

00:57:41.030 --> 00:57:43.480
a trade, oh, you're coming
to Westchester to work,

00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:45.880
they're like, sweet,
I'm charging more.

00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:46.570
So be aware.

00:57:46.570 --> 00:57:48.280
AUDIENCE: My father's
a contractor,

00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:50.049
but he's licensed
in Rockland, so.

00:57:50.049 --> 00:57:50.840
DREW SCOTT: Oh, OK.

00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:51.596
Well, good luck.

00:57:51.596 --> 00:57:52.970
He'll probably
charge you triple.

00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:53.595
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:57:53.595 --> 00:57:54.470
JONATHAN SCOTT: Yes.

00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:55.296
DREW SCOTT: Yeah, good luck.

00:57:55.296 --> 00:57:55.752
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:57:55.752 --> 00:57:56.210
Thanks.

00:57:56.210 --> 00:57:57.835
ALAN SEALES: Well,
we are at time here.

00:57:57.835 --> 00:57:59.647
"Dream Home" came
out today, right?

00:57:59.647 --> 00:58:00.480
JONATHAN SCOTT: Yes.

00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:01.150
DREW SCOTT: Yes.

00:58:01.150 --> 00:58:02.858
ALAN SEALES: Yes, so
you in the room here

00:58:02.858 --> 00:58:05.170
are some of the first in
the world to own this book.

00:58:05.170 --> 00:58:05.440
JONATHAN SCOTT: Yes.

00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:06.980
ALAN SEALES: And it sold out
before the event even started.

00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:07.720
JONATHAN SCOTT:
It did, and if you

00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:09.386
didn't get a copy,
by the way, or if you

00:58:09.386 --> 00:58:11.741
have family that wants to
come and get a copy, tonight

00:58:11.741 --> 00:58:13.990
we're going to be at the
Union Square Barnes and Noble

00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:15.012
at 7 o'clock.

00:58:15.012 --> 00:58:16.220
We're doing a meet and greet.

00:58:16.220 --> 00:58:17.350
We're going to sign books.

00:58:17.350 --> 00:58:19.660
We're going to say, hello,
answer some more questions.

00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:20.882
So that's nice and close.

00:58:20.882 --> 00:58:22.590
So if any of you want
to come down there,

00:58:22.590 --> 00:58:24.800
we're going to pack the place
and have a bunch more fun.

00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:25.883
DREW SCOTT: Do me a favor.

00:58:25.883 --> 00:58:27.590
Everyone, grab a
photo with the book.

00:58:27.590 --> 00:58:28.320
Post it online.

00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:29.100
Help us spread the
word a little bit.

00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:30.600
I mean, we want to
go to number one.

00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:32.810
We put a lot of heart
and soul into the book.

00:58:32.810 --> 00:58:33.900
And, I mean, it's
already number one

00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:35.380
on Amazon, which
is really amazing.

00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:35.790
ALAN SEALES: Is it really?

00:58:35.790 --> 00:58:36.350
DREW SCOTT: It's amazing, yeah.

00:58:36.350 --> 00:58:37.120
So, thanks, to
everyone who bought.

00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:37.650
But--

00:58:37.650 --> 00:58:37.950
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:58:37.950 --> 00:58:39.430
DREW SCOTT: We're going
to do some autograph

00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:41.067
signing, some photos,
and, again, you

00:58:41.067 --> 00:58:42.150
can get the book anywhere.

00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:42.750
Go anywhere.

00:58:42.750 --> 00:58:43.587
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:58:43.587 --> 00:58:45.962
DREW SCOTT: It's better than
Jon, and it talks back less.

00:58:45.962 --> 00:58:46.390
ALAN SEALES: Cool.

00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:46.890
All right.

00:58:46.890 --> 00:58:47.500
Thank you.

00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:48.860
DREW SCOTT: Thank you, other
brother from another mother.

00:58:48.860 --> 00:58:50.720
ALAN SEALES: You even
took my whole closing.
