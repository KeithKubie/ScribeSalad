00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.330
GILBERT STRANG: OK.

00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:05.760
We're still solving systems
of differential equations

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.500
with a matrix A in them.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.620
And now I want to
create the exponential.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:18.420
It's just natural to produce
e to the A, or e to the A t.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.920
The exponential of a matrix.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:27.450
So if we have one
equation, small a,

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.636
then we know the solution
is an e to the A t,

00:00:31.636 --> 00:00:34.220
times the starting value.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:41.250
Now we have n equations with
a matrix A and a vector y.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:48.025
And the solution should be,
at time t, e to the A t,

00:00:48.025 --> 00:00:49.750
times the starting value.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.200
It should be a perfect
match with this one, where

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.710
this had a number
in the exponent

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.120
and this has a matrix
in the exponent.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.440
OK.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.620
No problem.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.090
We just use the series
for e to the A t.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.770
We plug in a matrix
instead of a number.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:18.280
So the identity, plus A
t, plus 1/2 A t squared,

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.450
plus 1/6 of A t cubed, forever.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.130
It's the same.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.840
It's the exponential series.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.480
The most important series
in mathematics, I think.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.590
And it gives us an answer.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.870
And that answer is a matrix.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.060
Everything here, every
term, is a matrix.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.860
OK.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.220
Now, is that the right answer?

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.570
We check that by putting it
into the differential equation.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.590
So I want to put that
solution into the equation.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.900
So I need to take
the derivative.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.360
The derivative of
this is the derivative

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.050
of-- that's a constant.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:02.170
The derivative of that is A.
The derivative of this is 1/2.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.520
I have an A squared,
and I have a t squared.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.250
The derivative of t squared
is 2t, so that'll just be a t.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.500
The 2 and the 2 cancel.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.430
OK.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.380
Now I have A cubed here.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.410
t cubed?

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.050
The derivative of t cubed is 3t
squared, so I have a t squared.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.460
And the 3 cancels
the 3 and the 6,

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:35.990
and leaves 1 over 2
factorial, and so on.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.040
And I look at that.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.240
And I say it's very
much like the one above.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.970
Look.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.130
This series is just
A times this one.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.260
Multiply the top one by A.
A times I is A. A times A t

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.860
is A squared t.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.990
Term by term, it
just has a factor A.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:02.210
So it's A e to the A
t, is the derivative

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.930
of my matrix exponential.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.030
It brings down an A.
Just what we want.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.970
Just what we want.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:16.150
So then if I add
a y of 0 in here,

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.870
that's just a constant vector.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.033
I'll have a y of 0.

00:03:19.033 --> 00:03:22.550
I'll have a y of 0 here.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.250
When I put this into the
differential equation,

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.470
it works.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:27.760
It works.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.610
Now, is it better than what
we had before, which was using

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.570
eigenvalues and eigenvectors?

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.650
It's better in one way.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.620
This exponential, this
series, is totally fine

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.910
whether we have n independent
eigenvectors or not.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.940
We could have
repeated eigenvalues.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.750
I'll do an example.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.420
So for with repeated eigenvalues
and missing eigenvectors,

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.360
e to the A t is still
the correct answer.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.810
Still the correct answer.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.850
But if we want to use
eigenvalues and eigenvectors

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.230
to compute e to
the A t, because we

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.050
don't want to add up an
infinite series very often,

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.990
then we would want n
independent eigenvectors.

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:19.374
So what am I saying?

00:04:19.374 --> 00:04:23.100
I'm saying that this e
to the A t-- All right,

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.796
suppose we have n
independent eigenvectors.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.410
And we know that that
means, in that case,

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:39.450
a is V times lambda
times V inverse.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.360
And we can write V
inverse because the matrix

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.710
V has the eigenvectors.

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.040
This is the eigenvector matrix.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.930
If I have n independent
eigenvectors,

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.840
that matrix is invertible.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.570
I have that nice formula.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.575
And now I can see
what is-- e to the A

00:04:56.575 --> 00:05:03.110
t is always identity plus A.

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.630
I'm now going to use
the diagonalization,

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:14.350
the eigenvectors, and
the eigenvalues for A.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.920
So I'm doing the
good case now, when

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.970
there are a full set of
independent eigenvectors.

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:28.390
Then the A t is V
lambda V inverse t.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:36.190
That's right, that's I, plus
A t, plus 1/2 A t squared.

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.110
Right?

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.190
So I need A squared.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:44.050
So everybody remembers
what A squared is.

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:51.190
A squared is V lambda V inverse,
times V lambda V inverse.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:06:00.230
And those cancel out to give
V lambda squared V inverse,

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.300
times t squared, and so on.

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:13.710
You remember this A squared,
so I'll take that away.

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.980
And look at what I've got.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.120
Look what I've got it.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.080
Yes.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.230
Factor V out of the
start, and factor

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.990
V inverse out of the end.

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:32.760
And in here I have V times V
inverse is I, so that's fine.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:37.460
V times V inverse,
I have a lambda t.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:44.210
V and a V inverse, so I
have a 1/2 half lambda

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.470
squared t squared.

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:52.130
And so on, times V inverse.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:55.120
This is all just
what we hope for.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.590
We expect that a V goes out
at the far left at the front.

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.400
This V inverse comes
out at the far right.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.800
And what do you
see in the middle?

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:13.010
You see-- so this is now my
formula for e to the A t, is V.

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:15.570
And what do I have there?

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:20.270
I have the exponential
series for lambda t.

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:26.300
So it's e to the
lambda t V inverse.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.420
And what is e to the lambda t?

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.460
Let's just understand
the matrix exponential.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:35.070
When the matrix is diagonal,
the best possible matrix,

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:39.660
this will be V. What
does my matrix look like?

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.240
V inverse.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.230
If I'm looking at
this, looking at this.

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:45.610
Lambda is diagonal.

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:49.780
All these matrices are
diagonal with lambdas.

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:56.025
So that'll be e to the lambda
1t down to e to the lambda nt.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.920
I'm not doing anything
brilliant here.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:10.730
I'm just using the
standard diagonalization

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:18.060
to produce our exponential
from the eigenvector matrix

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:19.760
and from the eigenvalues.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.600
So I'm just taking
the exponentials

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.900
of the n different eigenvalues.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.422
So e to the A t.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:37.409
This would lead to e to the A
t y at 0, would be-- y of 0 is

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:38.669
some combination.

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:43.770
And then there's an e to the
lambda 1t coming from here.

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:54.110
And there's an x eigenvector x1,
plus C2 e to the lambda 2t x2,

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:54.680
so on.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.910
That's the solution
that we had last time.

00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:02.600
That's the solution that using
eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:03.100
Now.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:08.240
Can Can I get
something new here?

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:12.120
Something new will be,
suppose there are not

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.880
a full set of n
independent eigenvectors.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.910
e to the A t is still OK.

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:23.130
But this formula is no good.

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:25.720
That formula depends
on V and V inverse.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.210
And suppose we have an example.

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:31.230
So all that is very nice.

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:33.480
That's what we expect.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:38.640
But we could have a
matrix like this one.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:42.215
A equals-- well,
here's an extreme case.

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:48.740
What are the eigenvalues
of that matrix?

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.200
It's a diagonal matrix.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.030
The eigenvalues are 0 and 0.

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:55.890
The eigenvalue of 0 is repeated.

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:57.800
It's a double eigenvalue.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.760
And we hope for
two eigenvectors,

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.710
but we don't find them.

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:05.510
That has only one
line of eigenvectors.

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:10.530
It only has an x1
equals 1, 0, I think.

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:16.480
If I multiply that A, times
that x1, gives me 0 times x1.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.440
That's an eigenvector.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.410
Well, because the
eigenvalue is 0,

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:24.330
I'm looking for the null space.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:28.270
There is in the null
space, but the null space

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:30.490
is only one-dimensional.

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:32.460
Only one eigenvector.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.090
Missing an eigenvector.

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:39.210
Still, still, I can
do e to the A t.

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:41.170
That's still completely correct.

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:42.870
That series will work.

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:45.500
So to do this series I
need to know a squared.

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:50.340
So I'm actually going
to use the series,

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:53.530
but you'll see that
it cuts off very fast.

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:56.770
a squared, if you work
that out, it's all 0's.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:07.755
So our e to the A t is just
I, plus A t, plus STOP.

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.440
A squared is all 0's.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.240
A cubed is all 0's.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:22.570
So the matrix e to the A
t is identity, a times t.

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:26.285
a is this, times t is
going to put a t there.

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:32.000
There you go.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.910
That's a case of the
matrix exponential,

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:40.070
which would lead us to the
solution of the equations.

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:42.556
Of course, it's a pretty
simple exponential.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.660
But it comes from
pretty simple equations.

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:52.900
The equations dy dt, that
system of two equations,

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:55.840
with that matrix in it.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:12:01.690
Our system of equations
is just dy1 dt,

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:05.170
I have a 1 there so
it would be a y2.

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:13.930
And dy2 dt is 0
on the second row.

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:17.000
Well, that's pretty
easy to solve.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.510
In fact, this tells you how
to solve-- you could naturally

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:24.460
ask the question, how do we
solve differential equations

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:29.810
when the matrix doesn't
have n eigenvectors?

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:31.750
Here's an example.

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:34.130
This matrix has only
one eigenvector.

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:37.820
But the equation that we just
solved by, you could say,

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:39.450
back substitution.

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:42.515
This gives Y2 equal constant.

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:51.330
And then that equation, dy1 dt
equal that constant, gives me

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:54.630
y1 equals t times constant.

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.191
That's what I'm seeing.

00:13:01.191 --> 00:13:01.690
Oh.

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:03.490
Yeah.

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:06.570
Are you surprised to
see a t show up here?

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:11.220
Normally I don't see a t
in matrix exponentials.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:14.980
But in this repeated
case, that's

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:17.290
the t that we're
always seeing when

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:19.150
we have repeated solutions.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:23.740
Everybody remembers that when
we have second-order equations,

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:29.520
and we have the two
exponents are the same.

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:33.260
So we only get one solution
of that, e to the st.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.090
And we have to look
for another one.

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:37.040
And that other one is?

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.800
te to the st. It's
that same t there.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.470
OK.

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:46.170
There is an example
of how a matrix

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:54.840
with a missing eigenvector,
the exponential pops a t in.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.840
The exponential pops a t in.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:59.810
And if I had two
missing eigenvectors,

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:01.800
then in the exponential.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.910
Shall I just show you an example
with two missing eigenvectors?

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:13.490
Let a be-- well, here it
would be 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:16.875
triple 0, with, let's say.

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:25.890
There's a matrix with
three 0 eigenvalues,

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:28.010
but only one eigenvector.

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:30.260
So it's missing
two eigenvectors.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.260
And I would, in the
end, in e to the A t

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:40.300
here, I would see
probably 1, 1, 1, t, t,

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.120
and probably I'll see
a 1/2 t squared there.

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.160
A little bit like that.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.950
But one step worse.

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:55.130
Because the triple
eigenvalue, well, that's

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:57.720
not going to happen
very often in reality.

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:02.530
But we see what it produces.

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:06.606
It produces a t squared
as well as the t's.

00:15:06.606 --> 00:15:07.452
OK.

00:15:07.452 --> 00:15:10.340
So, the x matrix
exponential gives

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:15.900
a beautiful, concise, short
formula for the solution.

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:21.380
And it gives a formula
that's correct,

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:25.690
even in the case of
missing eigenvectors.

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:27.430
Thank you.
