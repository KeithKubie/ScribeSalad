00:00:00.305 --> 00:00:01.500
MALE SPEAKER: Hi, everyone.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.280
Welcome to another Authors
at Google Talk.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.240
We're have to have DC
Pierson with us.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.280
First time I met him, he was
doing improv at the Upright

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.420
Citizens Brigade theater.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.660
And then I found out he had a
host of other things that he

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.170
did, which is write books.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.050
He wrote and starred in a
independent movie that he did

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.990
as part of his comedy troupe.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.410
And so we're very excited
to have him today.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.410
DC Pierson.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.990
DC PIERSON: Hey, guys.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.670
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:29.920
DC PIERSON: Hey.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:33.180
How's it going?

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.990
Thanks for coming out.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.080
So my name is DC Pierson.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.060
I wrote a book called "The Boy
Who Couldn't Sleep and Never

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:45.890
Had To." And then actually next
Thursday, March 7, my new

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.400
book is coming out.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.410
It's called "Crap Kingdom," and
I wanted to talk a little

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.970
bit about that, and a little bit
about the process of being

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.770
a writer while also doing a
bunch of other things and

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.100
hopefully be funny and
or interesting.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.400
I'd rather be funny
than informative.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.060
Hopefully I'll be one or
the other, though.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.120
So my book "Crap Kingdom" is a
young adult comedic fantasy

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.760
adventure about a kid who loves
Chronicles of Narnia, he

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.940
loves Harry Potter, he loves
basically anything where

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.530
there's a kid in the normal
world and he gets taken to a

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.340
crazy magical fantasy realm
where he gets told, you're the

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.920
chosen one, in this crazy
magical fantasy realm.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.240
And then that actually happens
to our main character.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.940
He gets taken to a crazy magical
fantasy realm from our

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.960
world, where he's told,
you're the chosen one.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.850
It just turns out that the crazy
magical fantasy realm in

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.920
which he's the chosen one is
really, really crappy.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.580
And so it's kind of a book,
among other things, about

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.610
trying to exist in two worlds.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.490
Because he kind of likes
his life on Earth.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.520
He thinks it's OK.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.020
He thinks it's maybe too OK, and
the fact that it's so OK

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.840
means that he'll never be taken
to another world and

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.420
told he's the chosen one.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.290
And when that actually happens
to him, and the world in which

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.440
he's the chosen one is really
crappy, he's like, maybe I

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.169
don't want to do this.

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:11.950
Maybe I just want to go back
to the real world.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.710
Maybe I wasn't fully
appreciating it or whatever.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.890
And that's kind of a little
bit what I wanted to talk

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.930
about in my own life, and kind
of my own journey, if you want

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.190
to pretentiously call it that,
with trying to exist in

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.830
multiple worlds.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.930
So part of the premise of my
book, and I think also part of

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.240
the premise of most fantasy
literature--

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.190
I don't know if there's any
people who have been or are

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.460
fans of fantasy literature
in here.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.190
I figured it was a
pretty safe bet.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.340
But it feels like in fantasy
literature--

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.940
like things in science fiction
or things in real life, they

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.630
take place in a universe.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.120
And universes are bound by
physical laws and science, and

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.540
they have actual boundaries.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.850
And if you're an avid "Radio
Lab" listener the way I am,

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.110
apparently there's multiple
universes, and they're

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.050
expanding like soap bubbles
or something.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.750
I don't really remember.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.330
I just thought it was very
interesting while I was

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.090
folding laundry and I was like,
hmm, this really changes

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.540
everything.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.510
And it did, but I don't remember
anything about it.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.230
But in fantasy literature, it's
almost like instead of

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.370
universes, we have worlds.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.360
We have that thing that's in the
front of the book that's

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.340
like the map.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.710
It's like Middle Earth or
Narnia or whatever.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.740
And worlds seem to be, instead
of like universes being bound

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:40.890
by like actual hard physical
science, worlds kind of seem

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.810
to be held together
more by vibe.

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.430
Like when you go to Middle
Earth, you know you're in

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.980
Middle Earth.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.310
When you go to Narnia, you know
you're in Narnia, because

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.840
everything represents things
from the Bible.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.740
That's what I love about
fantasy literature--

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.010
is that instead of these very
sort of hard, bound by

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.680
physics, soap bubble universes
that are constantly expanding,

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.470
you have worlds that are
connected by a wardrobe, or a

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:12.150
portal, or in my case in "Crap
Kingdom," a Goodwill donation

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.190
box in the parking
lot of a Kmart.

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.769
That should've been his
first clue, actually.

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.900
And I like, and have liked for
many years, as a person and as

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.050
an artist, enjoyed existing in
a lot of different worlds.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.830
Because in addition to
being an author, an

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.520
actor, I'm a comedian--

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.720
I started in sketch and then
studied improv and now I do

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.820
stand up as well.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.290
I'm in commercials.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.210
You may have seen me trying to
sell you Allstate Insurance,

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.520
which I'm sure is fine.

00:04:45.028 --> 00:04:48.080
I have Geico.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.000
But anyway, it's
not important.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.010
Dennis Haysbert's so mad
at me right now.

00:04:53.010 --> 00:05:02.070
So I've liked being the funny
comedian person in a room full

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.680
of other authors.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.780
And I've liked being the
literary authorial person in a

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:07.950
room full of comedians.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.020
I really enjoy it.

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.680
I like going between
different worlds.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.190
I like trying to learn
everything about whatever

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.440
world I'm in and mastering
it and trying to fit in.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.800
I also like just being like,
whatever, I'm just here for

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.240
the day, and screwing around,
the way I maybe

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.580
am doing right now.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.030
And I love that.

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.770
And the sort of interesting
thing about trying to pursue

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.320
multiple tracks at the same
time, or trying to be like a

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.560
polymath, if you want
to put it that way--

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.320
I do, because it sounds
awesome--

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.260
is not everybody wants
you to do that.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.700
I feel like for the most part,
what people want you to do is

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.010
go, I am this.

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.530
I am the best this
that there is.

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.250
But I've always kind of
preferred to be like, well,

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:54.120
I'm a lot of things.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.400
And if you encounter me
first doing one thing,

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.970
hey, I also do this.

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.610
And I can do all that
stuff, so I like

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:01.380
to do all that stuff.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.580
And it's been a little bit of
a struggle, but I have found

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.150
some synthesis with it in and
around my most recent book.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:13.660
But I wanted really quickly
talk about kind of where I

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:20.030
came from, which is a sketch
comedy background.

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.970
I'm from Arizona originally,
but I went school at NYU,

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:24.740
where I studied writing
for television.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.720
And once there, I sort of fell
in with-- that makes it sound

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.110
like a gang.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.950
I fell in with some sketch
comedy bad boys.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.770
Not really, at all.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.330
But I started doing sketch
comedy, and that led me to the

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.290
Upright Citizens Brigade
theater, where I learned

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:40.770
sketch and improv and stuff.

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.430
I'm trying to think of the
best way to approach

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:50.085
talking about it.

00:06:50.085 --> 00:06:53.420
So I was in a really large 15
person college sketch group.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:59.140
And then a bunch of those people
graduated, and a couple

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.320
friends of mine and myself got
put in charge of our college

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:01.980
sketch group.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:06.120
And those guys were myself,
Donald Glover, who you may

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.140
know, who's gone on to star in
"Community" and also raps

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.360
under the name Childish
Gambino.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.120
There was one dude that just
got like 10 times more

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.340
interested, and I like that.

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.280
He was like, oh, really,
OK, cool.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.060
Put down my yam that
I'm chewing on.

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.490
And another friend of mine named
Dominic Dierkes, and

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:26.530
then a film director named Dan
Eckman, and a producer named

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:27.780
Meggie McFadden.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:35.210
First of all, myself, Dominic,
and Donald, we ended up

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:36.510
running this college
sketch group.

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:40.070
We would put up these monthly
sketch shows, where the idea

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:43.260
was hey, all these 10, 12 people
that are going to put

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.180
on this show, everybody's
going to write original

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.120
material, we're all going to
band together and put on a

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.770
show, like we're kids in an
after school special that are

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:52.770
trying to save the teen
center, right?

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:57.520
And the problem was that
everyone else in the group was

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.620
all doing different things.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:07:59.760
They wanted to work
on their major.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.490
They were like, I can't write a
sketch this month because I

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:05.360
have to go be in a production
of "Pippin" that takes place

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.660
in space, so I can't
write anything.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.760
So the three of us
would end up all

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.035
writing material together.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.500
And I just realized I have
no way of knowing when

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:18.460
I'm going over time.

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:20.840
So Mike, if you could you give
me a light when I'm like half

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:21.500
an hour in?

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:21.786
All right.

00:08:21.786 --> 00:08:21.930
Cool.

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:22.910
And he's like, now.

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:24.570
It's now.

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:27.845
So we would end up writing a
bunch of material together,

00:08:27.845 --> 00:08:29.750
and it turned out we all really
liked each other's

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:32.350
style, and liked each
other's vibe.

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:35.640
I feel like I can use that word,
because we're in Venice.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:39.440
And so the three of us plus
Dan and Meggie ended up

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.820
forming another sketch group
unto ourselves, where instead

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.560
of performing stuff live--

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.240
because every time you do a
sketch live, you have to show

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.760
up at the bar or whatever, and
like place all the wigs and

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.150
prop guns under all
the chairs--

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:56.400
and we figured, let's just shoot
these sketches once, and

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.370
then they can just kind
of exist forever.

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.940
And this was around 2004.

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:04.070
And the most that we thought
could happened was, well,

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:05.680
we'll put them on our own
personal website.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.020
We'll pay for hosting, and
there'll be a little QuickTime

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:08.530
that shows up.

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:09.920
It'll take 12 minutes
to download.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:16.020
Someone can watch this three
minute penis joke, and then

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.250
move on, and then maybe we'll
get to be on "MadTV," which

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:20.110
was still a going concern
at the time.

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:25.130
And what ended up happening was
we shot a couple sketches,

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:29.590
and we didn't have the money to
buy a server to host all of

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:32.700
our three minute QuickTime
penis jokes.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:36.830
And the sketch "Lazy Sunday"
had just premiered on

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:39.330
"Saturday Night Live."
And that was--

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.890
maybe it's not the actual true
story, maybe like the literal

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:44.180
founder of YouTube is here,
and he'll disagree.

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:44.910
He's probably not.

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:46.730
He's probably in space.

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:50.320
But that sort of rocketed
YouTube

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.530
to prominence, weirdly.

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:53.490
The first time I ever heard
about YouTube was in

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:56.760
connection with "Lazy Sunday,"
and this sketch that played on

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.860
"Saturday Night Live" had had a
huge afterlife on this thing

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:00.620
called YouTube.

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:01.770
So I was like, oh, that
sounds interesting.

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:04.020
So I went into my school's
computer lab.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.750
I went onto YouTube.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:10.510
And I was like, I'll just upload
these sketches that I

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:12.890
have in my email onto to this
thing called YouTube, and

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:14.280
we'll just see what happens.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.340
Because we don't have the
money to put them online

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:19.660
ourselves, so this seems like
an easy enough workaround.

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:22.080
And the name of our group was
Derrick, and I ended up making

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:26.970
our user name on YouTube Derrick
Comedy, and that ended

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:28.500
up becoming the name
of our group.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.610
Which is a little bit weird--
it's like having music in the

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:31.845
name of your brand.

00:10:31.845 --> 00:10:33.580
You're like, oh, comedy!

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:34.810
It's a little bit obvious.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:39.380
But at the time, there was so
little on YouTube that wasn't

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:42.680
just cats dancing.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:46.320
It's still proportionally not
that much more than that.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.920
But because I wanted to be
like this is comedy.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.120
What you're watching is people
trying to be funny.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:55.060
And even despite that, most of
our early videos, the first

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.990
comment on them would
always be-- fake!

00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:58.500
This is fake.

00:10:58.500 --> 00:10:59.470
It's like, yeah, it is fake.

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:00.250
We made it.

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:00.470
It's fake.

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.860
You're right.

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.375
You're correct.

00:11:02.375 --> 00:11:03.550
You can't fool me.

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:05.800
It's like no, that's fine.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.000
I hope you think it's fake.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.780
If you think it's real,
that's a problem.

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:15.181
And so it ended up kind
of taking off.

00:11:15.181 --> 00:11:19.780
We had one sketch called
"Bro Rape," very cool--

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:23.630
very cool thing to say in
a professional setting--

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:27.380
that ended up kind of getting a
really huge, I guess, viral

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:28.800
audience, if you want
to call it that.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.370
And then from then on, a lot of
our sketches had a lot more

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:33.660
eyes on them.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:37.370
And instead of paying ourselves
with money that

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:39.530
ended up coming in when YouTube
started doing revenue

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:42.900
sharing, or from touring or
merchandising, which were also

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.680
things that we did with our
somewhat little slice of

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.260
notoriety that we were carving
out, we decided to put all of

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:54.150
that money into an LLC and try
to save up to make something

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:56.680
larger with it, like an
independent movie or a TV show

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.100
or something like that.

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:02.570
And that seemed like a
really great idea.

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:05.310
And then I graduated from
college, and I didn't have any

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:06.000
money anymore.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.390
And then it was kind of like,
wait, so are we sure about

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:08.120
this LLC thing?

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:12.010
Because I could kind of use,
like, rent and pizza.

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:18.380
But so being in that college
sketch group and then going on

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:20.130
to being in Derrick--

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:23.590
and we made a movie, I'll talk
about it in a second--

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:27.310
I sort of learned a couple
things that I'm still eating

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:31.730
off of to this day,
or thinking about.

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:35.740
And the first one was when I was
still in college, and my

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:38.220
friend Donald was still in
college or whatever.

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.780
He is now a very
famous rapper.

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:45.460
He was just nominated in the
same category as Jay-Z and

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.670
Kanye West at the MTV
VMAs last year.

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:51.780
At the time, he was just an RA
in his dorm who just made

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:54.460
beats and raps on the side.

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:56.170
And I sound like a dad
when I say that.

00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:58.710
He made some beats
and some raps.

00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:01.500
He turned the hip hop crank
and some raps came out.

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:02.180
It was great.

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:04.030
That's good.

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:05.280
Have an apple.

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:13.000
But we would often talk about
the idea that we wanted to--

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.800
like, our dream in life was to
be able to just make your

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.130
whole culture.

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:24.990
We liked the idea that us and
our friends would make enough

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:29.900
stuff that a person could
conceivably live culturally in

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:32.200
terms of listening to music,
reading, watching movies,

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.140
watching TV shows, off just
the stuff that we made.

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:39.450
And it's a super lofty goal,
but I still have that in my

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:41.900
mind as what I would like to do
more than anything-- is be

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:45.360
able to sustain someone, I don't
know for how long, but

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.730
through just what we do.

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:51.990
And I still have that in my
head, even though it's a

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:53.260
little bit ridiculous.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:54.750
And the other thing that I
noticed, and I was just

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:56.170
thinking about this yesterday,
actually.

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:57.930
When I first got into that
sketch comedy group in

00:13:57.930 --> 00:13:59.040
college, and there
were 15 of us.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:13:59.790
We were all very excited.

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:02.040
We were going to save
the teen center.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:05.060
We would always talk about oh,
we should do a radio show.

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:07.410
We should do puppets.

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:08.975
You know, I don't
know, whatever.

00:14:08.975 --> 00:14:10.480
Just all these different
pursuits that we

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.270
really wanted to do.

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:12.830
And this was my freshman year,
and I'm like, well, we'll have

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:14.040
all this time this summer.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.320
We would always talk
about this summer.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.100
We're going to do
it this summer.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:16.880
We have all this time.

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.360
And I'm sure you guys have
experienced the same thing,

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.350
when you're working on a project
and you're like, oh, I

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:21.830
had this other great idea
for this thing I

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:24.270
really want to do.

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:28.370
It's a comic strip about living
pastas or whatever.

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:30.210
And you're like, I'm going to do
that as soon as this thing

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:33.850
is done, and I just have this
huge vista of time.

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:36.040
Well, what ended up happening,
as I'm sure you've experienced

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:39.990
as well, is that vista of
totally unencumbered time

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:41.120
never actually came.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:43.470
It would always be the next
thing that we had to do, that

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:44.970
we had to keep working on.

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:48.280
And that still is true for
me to this day, where I'm

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.840
convinced, OK, after I finish--
like my book comes

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.320
out next week on Thursday, and
I have this foolish thing in

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:56.040
my head, like after that
happens, then I'll just be

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.750
free to just learn the guitar.

00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:59.440
Or whatever.

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.370
Not that.

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:06.570
And it never comes, that sort
of ethereal summer of

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:09.520
unlimited creativity where
you're going to get a shack

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:11.730
and put a drum in it.

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:13.090
Never actually happens.

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:18.530
But I like to think that if you
kind of live a full sort

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:22.440
of creative life, then you turn
around after a point and

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:25.410
you realize that you've been
doing all that stuff the

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:26.140
entire way along.

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.800
It just didn't feel like that
perfect creative time of just

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:33.800
letting your mind roam
free on a porch.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.680
And the final thing that I
kind of learned-- not the

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:38.830
final thing in my presentation,
no-- but the

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:41.720
final thing that I learned from
doing sketch and doing

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.240
improv and doing all these
different things is--

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.650
well, I didn't learn it from
this, but the first time I

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:48.690
heard it was in a Lauryn
Hill song.

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:50.130
I don't know if you guys are
Lauryn Hill fans, but she had

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:52.580
a follow up single to her first
smash single, "Doo-Wop

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:57.880
(That Thing)," in which she said
everything is everything.

00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.660
That's the hook of the song--
everything is everything.

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:00.480
Right?

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:01.090
Yeah, it's good, right?

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:01.380
Yeah.

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:02.660
There's a cool video.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:03.950
New York City's like a record.

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:04.430
It's great.

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:07.870
You can watch it on
Vevo after this.

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:09.260
Give her some ad money.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.370
Who knows what she'll
spend it on?

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:14.710
She's going to be so
mad at me for that.

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:18.400
But I first heard that song,
and it's a good song, but I

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.430
was like, that's such a silly,
meaningless thing.

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:21.640
Everything is everything.

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:26.010
That's such a silly sort of like
weird fake zen BS thing.

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:29.460
And what I realized through
doing sketch and doing improv

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:32.730
and then going out and trying
to do other things is that I

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:35.360
had already kind of in a weird
way learned not literally

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.920
everything I needed to know, but
a lot of what I needed to

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.630
know by learning how to do
sketch, learning how to do

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:41.710
improv, whatever.

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:43.940
Everything really
was everything.

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:48.720
I learned how to write like
children's TV and late night

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:51.440
jokes in college.

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.150
Because it wasn't
a real college.

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:59.690
And when I sat down to
write my first book--

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:02.030
this is what a book is--

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:06.920
I realized all of those skills
that I had learned trying to

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:11.160
write that "Law and Order:
Criminal Intent" spec scripts

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.060
were really helping
me write this big

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:17.020
work of literary fiction.

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:22.849
When we went to make our first
feature film, "Mystery Team"

00:17:22.849 --> 00:17:25.700
the fact that we had been
studying how to write sketch

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:30.240
helped us know how to write a
movie in terms of what to do,

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.760
but also in terms of what not
to do, because a sketch is

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:33.960
different than a movie.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:36.500
So the best thing I feel like
you can do if you want to

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:39.520
learn one thing is to learn
about anything,

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.880
because it all applies.

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:43.140
And that sounds very--

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:44.975
first of all, I'm certainly not
the first person to say

00:17:44.975 --> 00:17:49.350
it, but it sounds very kind of
zen and hippie-ish and vibey.

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:53.150
But it really has been true.

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:54.510
It has proven true for me.

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:56.770
Everything really
is everything.

00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:58.600
And I don't know.

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.770
Lauryn Hill is right
about everything.

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:03.090
Except for white people.

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:05.980
We're cool.

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:06.640
Let's see here.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.910
I have a lot of cards that I
decided at a certain point to

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:09.660
stop flipping through.

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.160
Oh, yeah.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.580
So I graduated from college.

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:17.380
And all throughout college, I
would go into the computer lab

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:19.070
really late at night, and rather
than working on the

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:20.920
work I was supposed to be
working on, I would just end

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:23.430
up writing short stories
or little

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:24.890
comedy pieces or whatever.

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:29.160
Because as I'm sure you well
know, the best time to get

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.640
anything done is to
have another thing

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:32.860
you're supposed to do.

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:35.000
And then you'll just be like
yeah, my living room is so

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.315
clean now or whatever.

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:42.240
And I would post them
on my website.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.870
And I always felt a little bit
weird about telling comedy

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:45.750
friends of mine about them.

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:48.355
Because when you think of
comedians, you think they're

00:18:48.355 --> 00:18:53.370
going to be like, hur, hur,
nice short story, dick.

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:54.730
Actually, I think I'm
thinking of Biff.

00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:01.960
But people started finding my
website, and friends of mine.

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.820
And then one day I was on the
subway, and I was coming in

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:06.580
from Queens, and I saw
my friend Eliza.

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:09.740
And she was like, I really like
these short stories you

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:11.140
write on your website.

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:11.680
I was like, oh, thank you.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.170
She was like, you should
write a novel.

00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:14.330
And I was like, oh,
I would really

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:14.960
like to do that someday.

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.040
That would be something
I would like

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.850
to do at some point.

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:20.020
And she got really serious.

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:21.810
And it wasn't actually
happening, because it couldn't

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:22.670
really happen on the subway.

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:23.330
There are no windows.

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:25.540
But in my memory, the wind
started blowing through her

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:26.760
hair-- you know what I mean?

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:30.970
And she was like, a lot of
people say that, but not a lot

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:32.520
of people ever do it.

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.170
And then again, in my memory,
she then blew away in the wind

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:39.570
like sand, but she actually
just got off at a stop.

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:42.010
But that was the effect that it
had on me, was of somebody

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:43.970
who would then disappear
or whatever.

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:52.615
And at the time, I was temping
in the accounting department

00:19:52.615 --> 00:19:55.420
at barnesandnoble.com.

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:56.310
RIP.

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:59.840
No, that's Borders, sorry.

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.380
Barnes and Noble is
still going great.

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:01.950
Go to their website.

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:04.890
Anyway, you have to suck up to
booksellers, I guess, when

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:07.230
you're an author.

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:10.430
But so I was working in their
accounting department.

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:13.530
And I was like, I'm on the
wrong side of books.

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:14.780
I want to be writing
something bigger.

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:15.240
She was right.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:15.970
A lot of people say it.

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:17.650
Not a lot of people
ever do it.

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:21.390
And as I've come to learn, my
great motivators are guilt and

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:25.200
fear and shame and competition,
not really like

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.090
inspiration and what they're
supposed to be, the higher

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:27.670
minded things.

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:29.900
It usually comes from somebody
being like, you can't do it.

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:32.990
And I'll be like, I'll
show you, dad.

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:39.500
So I told Eliza, I was
like, hey, I will--

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:40.460
I got so much louder.

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:41.230
Did you guys hear that?

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:42.350
Is that maybe because
I turned this way?

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:42.580
I don't know.

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:43.210
Yeah, you're right.

00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:45.280
Fair enough.

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:49.930
So I told Eliza, I was
like, hey, I'm

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:51.520
going to write a book.

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:52.580
I think I'm going
to write a book.

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:56.020
But I need you to every time
you see me just like bug me

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:59.150
about it-- just be like,
where's the book?

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:00.170
Where is it?

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:00.910
Hand over the book.

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:02.150
You know what I mean?

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:06.250
And I sort of made her into
my own mob enforcer of

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:07.150
motivation.

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:08.140
And she did it.

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:09.240
Every time she saw me, she
was like, where is it?

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:09.630
Where's the book?

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:12.120
And I was like, I'm trying.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.990
So I quit my temp job at
barnesandnoble.com, and I

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:16.410
didn't have any money.

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:19.640
And then I booked one little
tiny web commercial that

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:21.660
allowed me to then have
like a month off

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:22.830
just strictly to write.

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:24.840
And then that sort of
kept happening.

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:28.050
Because I had been an
improviser, and I worked at

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:30.340
the Upright Citizens Brigade,
I had ended up getting a

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:32.180
commercial agent, because
I bartended there.

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:34.250
And then the fact that I had a
commercial agent meant I kept

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:38.950
going out for commercials, and I
would book just one thing at

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:45.930
the totally right interval to
not be entirely broke, and I

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:46.900
could actually write.

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:50.530
I could do it for my
job, basically,

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:52.390
and work for myself.

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:55.150
And I would not have been able
to do that otherwise.

00:21:55.150 --> 00:22:02.870
So I finished the book, and
I sent it to my agent.

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:04.700
I didn't have a literary agent,
like somebody who could

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:05.470
go and sell a book.

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:08.530
I sent it to my acting agent
that I had gotten because me

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:10.630
and my friends made
popular dick joke

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:12.660
videos on the internet.

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:14.830
And she read the manuscript,
and she was like,

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:15.430
I really like this.

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:16.850
I have a friend who's
a literary agent.

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:19.320
I'll send it to him, and we'll
see what he thinks.

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:20.600
So she sent it to him.

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:21.060
He called me.

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:22.130
He was like, I really
like this book.

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:23.260
I want to represent it.

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:26.410
He sent it out to like nine
different publishing houses.

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:29.360
Eight of them said no, and
one of them said yes.

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:33.770
And I took the train in-- the
same train I'd met Eliza on--

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:35.680
to go and meet my editor.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.900
And I was like, man, when I walk
through those doors, I'm

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:40.050
not going to be dick
joke college

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:41.450
sketch group DC Pierson.

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:46.590
I'm going to be like august
literary specimen, future

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:51.950
Pulitzer Prize winner, "New York
Times" weekend magazine

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:56.780
interview having, literary
DC Pierson.

00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:59.650
And I walked through the
doors, and I go up,

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:00.710
and I meet my editor.

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:03.230
He's a guy named Jerry Howard.

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:04.560
He's been around forever.

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:08.270
He's super kind of tweedy and
literary and old school.

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:10.910
He's a person who you feel like
they're on Cape Cod even

00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:13.370
when they're not, they're
right there in front

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:15.220
of you in New York.

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:17.640
He did David Foster Wallace's
first book.

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:20.480
He edited Bret Easton
Ellis's first book.

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.390
And so I was like, this is
just going to be such a

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:23.220
literary guy.

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:25.850
I'm going to have to
speak in footnotes.

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:27.070
But that's cool, I'm prepared.

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:28.650
And so I went up there.

00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:30.320
And he turns to me.

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:32.310
Basically, the first thing he
says when he gets into the

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:36.260
room is, oh, hey, I just googled
Derrick and I love it.

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:36.890
It's hilarious.

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:40.400
That one video with the
dick, oh my God.

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:43.290
And what I came to find out was
that instead of keeping

00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:45.750
these worlds entirely segregated
like I had hoped

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:48.150
to-- so I could be like, I'll be
a dick joke guy over here,

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:50.850
and then I'll be an august
literary persona over here--

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:53.790
that the book people, with their
tweed patches on their

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:58.170
jackets, who still do a lot of
graphic design work on floppy

00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:05.570
disks, I swear to God, they
loved the dick joke videos.

00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:06.010
They loved them.

00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:06.890
They thought it was great.

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:09.670
It was a different thing than
what they were used to, which

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:12.630
is people that have like a
couple things published in the

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:14.260
"Utne Reader," and then they're
like, now here's a

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:15.510
novel about a novelist.

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:20.660
Not that there's anything
wrong with those.

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:22.240
And that was cool.

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.720
They seemed to kind of get it.

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:28.650
And like a year after I sold
them the book but a couple

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:30.710
years before it came out--
because that's how long

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:33.170
traditional publishing takes--

00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:36.500
I had a meeting with Jerry, my
editor, and a couple of other

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:40.140
publicity people about the book
coming out, and what I

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:42.150
was supposed to do and
everything like that.

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:43.730
They were talking about all the
promotional efforts they

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:46.990
were going to do.

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:50.030
And I was like, so, is there
anything that I can do between

00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:54.310
now and the book coming out,
Jerry, to help the book sell,

00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:56.660
to help its profile?

00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:59.320
And he just looked at me-- like
this tweedy Bret Easton

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:01.280
Ellis David Foster Wallace
dude-- and he was just like,

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.430
just get famous.

00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:05.380
And I was like, does
it matter for what?

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:07.110
And he was like, not at all.

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:11.640
He was telling me I could be
early Lindsay Lohan if I

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:13.660
wanted to and get famous for
being good at acting, or I

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:16.400
could be late period Lindsay
Lohan and get famous for

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:21.320
crashing a vodka truck into
another vodka truck.

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:27.280
And I was like, OK,
cool, I'll do it.

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.610
I'll try to get famous.

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:31.740
So right around that time, my
friends and I in Derrick had

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:34.530
shot our first movie, "Mystery
Team," which we financed

00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:37.160
through all that money that
we put into the LLC and I

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:40.700
therefore didn't get to spend
on rent and pizza, and also

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:48.240
some friends and family money
that they are slowly, slowly,

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.890
slowly getting back.

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:57.490
And we made our first feature
film, "Myster Team." And it

00:25:57.490 --> 00:25:58.930
went to Sundance.

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:05.690
And it was an interesting time,
because it was the just

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:09.660
perfect, perfect asshole
of the recession.

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:11.390
Just right in there.

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:14.120
Again, a really fun thing
to say in a workplace.

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:16.470
And nobody was buying movies.

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:19.160
And our movie in particular
was sort of a hard sell

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:22.870
because instead of, again, a
movie about a filmmaker or

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:27.600
whatever people buy at Sundance,
our movie was about

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:34.030
three sort of Encyclopedia Brown
style G rated aw shucks

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:38.720
detective kids having to solve
an R rated adult murder, and

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:41.150
then being sucked into a world
of crime and drugs

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:43.330
and boobs and stuff.

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:50.190
And so the movie didn't
sell at Sundance.

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:53.580
And people would continually
ask us about the movie when

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:56.000
sort of trying to tell us why
they weren't going to buy it

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.940
and release it on 50,000 screens
was, well, why is it

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:05.810
the G rated characters
in the R rated world?

00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:07.500
If it were just a G rated
thing, then that we get.

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:08.270
That's a G rated movie.

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:10.340
And if it were just an R rated
thing, that we understand,

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:11.520
because then it's R rated.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.535
But the G to the--

00:27:12.535 --> 00:27:13.540
And we were like, well,
that's the whole

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:15.260
premise of the movie.

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:16.902
That's what's funny
about it to us.

00:27:16.902 --> 00:27:18.660
That's the whole idea.

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:21.630
It would be like if somebody was
like, OK, so "Star Wars."

00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:24.260
We get Luke on the planet
at the beginning

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:25.330
on this home world.

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:26.740
We get that, that totally
makes sense.

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:28.120
And then we get the
stuff in space.

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:30.710
But why in the same movie?

00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:31.910
It's like, because
that's the movie.

00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:35.200
That's "Star Wars." That's the
whole premise, being on this

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.780
one world, and then going off
and having an adventure.

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:40.140
That's the whole what
makes it, it.

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:43.470
And they were like, hmm, bye.

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:46.130
And they pulled away.

00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:49.050
And so the movie did end
up selling, finally.

00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:51.540
We took it out here to LA and
back and forth to New York,

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:54.220
and it ended up getting
distributed.

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:57.970
And we, in conjunction with
our distributor, kind of

00:27:57.970 --> 00:28:01.700
developed this very
unconventional plan.

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:04.370
And when people have money
and they hear the word

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:07.150
unconventional, they start
to get really gun shy.

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:08.540
And there's a reason they do.

00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:10.880
It's because mostly conventions
are conventions

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:12.150
for a reason, because
they work.

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:14.770
We were doing something
unconventional, and it had

00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:15.580
mixed results.

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:17.750
We toured with our movie
in all these

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:18.560
different college towns.

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.130
Because we're popular
in colleges.

00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:21.980
We make dick joke videos.

00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:23.720
People will love us
in college towns.

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:26.550
We'll just put ourselves out
there, and then people will

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:27.430
come in droves.

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:28.030
Dick jokes!

00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:28.500
Dick jokes!

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:31.650
That's what they'll chant.

00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:36.530
And so we went to towns like
Iowa City, Iowa, Ames,

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:38.920
Tallahassee, Gainesville,
Florida.

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:41.980
And all throughout that entire
time, what we ended up

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:47.570
experiencing was very, very,
very empty auditoriums for the

00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:50.530
most part, but there would be
like three die hard kids in

00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:52.670
the front row that were so
excited to be there.

00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:54.520
And then we would do a Q&amp;A after
the movie, and then we

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:55.630
would sign posters.

00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:58.160
And I swear to God, in one of
the first towns that we were

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.110
in in Florida, the first kid
that came up to the table to

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:02.320
get his poster signed
was like, what are

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.190
you guys doing here?

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:06.130
Not in a way of, like, sweet,
but in a way of,

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:07.510
like, are you OK?

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:11.450
What has happened that you are
in Gainesville at this AMC

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:13.880
multiplex where all the
other movies have

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:16.410
$100 million budgets?

00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:19.230
And the answer was,
we don't know.

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:20.820
We don't know what
we're doing here.

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:21.830
But aren't you happy
we're here?

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:27.196
And he was like, it's more
disconcerting than anything.

00:29:27.196 --> 00:29:28.590
And no one knew we
were out there.

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:32.010
It would be a little bit
different now, I feel like,

00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:33.780
because Twitter is a little more
prominent or whatever,

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:35.440
there is a little more of a
precedent of like, I'm in your

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:36.510
town, show up.

00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:37.200
But maybe not.

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.320
It might have just been
the same thing.

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:41.950
So we kind of had to just get
our Henry Rollins on and just

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:43.930
kind of make it happen
somehow.

00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:46.090
So the fifth town that we went
to was a place called

00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:49.030
Columbia, Missouri, which is
an awesome college town.

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:50.890
I highly recommend it if you
guys are thinking of going

00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:54.750
back to undergrad, journalism
school, or whatever.

00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:56.920
And we were there, and it
was the same thing.

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:59.060
We were playing to like
three kids that were

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:01.490
like, why are you here?

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:04.310
Your parents are worried
about you.

00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:06.680
And I was like, we've
got to do something.

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:12.350
So I had been going to Targets
and stuff before doing Q&amp;As,

00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:15.420
because I was like, there's
three kids here.

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:17.630
We've got to give them something
for being the only

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:20.200
ones that are remotely active
enough to find out

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:21.230
that we're even here.

00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:24.450
So I would get them like
toy dinosaurs and weird

00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:25.910
foam bats and stuff.

00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:28.050
And then we were in Columbia,
and things

00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:29.060
were not going well.

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:30.830
And we were at Walmart.

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:31.770
Don't judge me.

00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:35.810
It's the only store in
a lot of places.

00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:36.940
And I was like, what
can we do?

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:37.480
What can we do?

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:40.740
And I just saw this bin
of foam swords.

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:42.730
I was like, swords.

00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:44.350
It's got to be swords.

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:47.560
So what we started doing to try
to build an audience in

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:49.810
this town that we were going
to be in for a week and

00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:52.630
playing in for a week is we
would tell the people that

00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:56.460
came to the movie, hey, if you
come tomorrow, you're going to

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:58.100
join Sword Club.

00:30:58.100 --> 00:30:59.220
And they were like,
what's Sword Club?

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:03.650
And I was like, we'll give you
a sword, and it'll be hand

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:07.360
numbered, unique to you,
with an inspirational

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:09.110
quote written on it.

00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:10.700
And they were like,
all right, man.

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:11.830
And they showed up
the next day.

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:13.050
They usually brought friends.

00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:14.840
Because it was like, why are you
going back to that movie?

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:15.680
He was like, Sword Club, man.

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:19.010
And then the friend
wants to go.

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:21.760
Before we went out on the road,
a friend of mine, this

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:24.390
guy named Todd Sklar, who's a
really cool filmmaker and a

00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:27.400
guy that also founded a company
that tours with little

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:31.520
independent movies to colleges,
strictly because he

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:33.600
wanted to get his first movie
that he made seen, and there

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.870
was no other way to do, he was
like, your main competition

00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:38.380
when you go into these college
towns, your main

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:41.610
competition is not--

00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:42.610
it's not even football.

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:44.520
It's not them going to
see another movie.

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.650
Your main competition is people
staying in their house

00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:50.010
and getting high and
eating doughnuts.

00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:51.790
And he was right.

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:53.065
And the doughnuts
were winning.

00:31:56.150 --> 00:31:59.620
So that was the impetus of Sword
Club, was to beat back

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:01.270
with foam swords
from Walmart--

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:03.320
again, that's the only place
that they sell these

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:05.460
particular swords, and they have
them in all Walmarts, and

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:06.450
they're great.

00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:07.700
Great product.

00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:14.120
We beat back the weed and the
doughnuts in Columbia.

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:15.100
People started coming.

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:18.430
By the end of the week, we were
playing to full houses.

00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:20.120
Oh, the other thing that we
promised was that if you

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:22.620
joined Sword Club, we'll take
your name and email address,

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:25.200
and we'll put your name
on the DVD, like

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.850
on a special feature.

00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:29.570
We have that on the "Mystery
Team" DVD--

00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:31.040
all the names of people that
joined Sword Club.

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:34.220
It ended up being about
300, 400 kids.

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:36.750
And it was also a way to let
people know that the DVD was

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:39.290
coming out and buy it so you can
see your name on the DVD,

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:40.110
and the movie.

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:41.540
It's pretty good too.

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:43.715
It's no your name or anything,
but it's all right.

00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:48.470
So we did that.

00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:52.510
And that battle against weed and
doughnuts has continued to

00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:55.790
be a battle for me, and I think
for a lot of artists.

00:32:55.790 --> 00:32:56.940
And especially now,
where it's like

00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:58.180
people have these computers.

00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:01.190
They don't have to go out and
do anything in particular.

00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:04.420
You're really having to present
a case as to why

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:09.750
whatever you have is better
than weed and doughnuts.

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:13.500
And I think back to when I first
started doing improv at

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:15.920
UCB in New York.

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:18.780
There's four people that founded
the UCB Theatre--

00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:21.500
Amy Poehler, Matt Walsh, Matt
Besser, and Ian Roberts--

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:27.180
and they built the theater not
from being like super famous

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:30.060
people on television, but
really from being on the

00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:32.390
street in New York and being
like, we are a thing.

00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:32.860
Come look.

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:35.830
It's better than just being
wherever you are right now.

00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:39.650
And my first year I started
doing stuff at the theater,

00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:41.433
which was during the magical
summer when we thought we were

00:33:41.433 --> 00:33:44.730
going to have all this time, I
was part of a thing called the

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:48.220
street ritual, which is what
they would do to promote their

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:51.130
annual event called the Del
Close Marathon, which is a 72

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:54.920
hour nonstop festival of long
form improvisation.

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:57.530
And what they would do is they
would have a trail of

00:33:57.530 --> 00:33:59.320
improvisers--

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:02.220
which is like the least
sexy phrase ever--

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:06.470
going from a park in the East
Village all the way up to the

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:07.712
theater, which is on
26th Street and

00:34:07.712 --> 00:34:09.260
8th Avenue in Chelsea.

00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:11.020
And you would pick up different

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:12.120
improvisers along the way.

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:17.540
And you would get a suggestion
at the beginning of the route

00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:20.070
from just a random passerby,
and then you would start

00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:22.080
chanting it, and then
it would morph.

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.400
And as you picked
up more people,

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:25.110
this chant would morph.

00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:27.920
At one point along the route,
it was just us, different

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:32.280
sections of the mob, chanting,
Bob Dylan, Jakob Dylan, Bob

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:35.040
Dylan, Jakob Dylan!

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:38.090
Obviously, the answer
is clear.

00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:42.600
But so as we were doing this,
we go into Union Square.

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:43.440
It's a beautiful summer day.

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:45.320
There's a bunch of people
sitting out just sunning

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:47.280
themselves, and we're
passing by.

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:49.120
And the most that you get out
of most people in New

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:50.820
York is like, huh.

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:52.639
Anyway.

00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:54.679
Or a stockbroker dude being
like, listen, who's

00:34:54.679 --> 00:34:55.480
paying for all this?

00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:57.398
Because that's what they want
to know-- like, what are you

00:34:57.398 --> 00:34:57.930
doing, what's the angle?

00:34:57.930 --> 00:34:59.960
Which happens a lot.

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:04.410
And as we're going along, I see
Matt Besser, one of the

00:35:04.410 --> 00:35:07.070
founders of the theater, run
onto the lawn and start

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:08.770
throwing flyers at all these
people that are sunning

00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:09.560
themselves.

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:11.620
And some people would look at
them and some people wouldn't,

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:13.130
and he'd just start screaming
at them--

00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:15.160
don't just be curious!

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:17.150
Don't just be curious!

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:19.560
Which is, when you think about
it, one of the most important

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:22.530
tenets of, I guess, marketing,
creativity, anything, is

00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:24.730
trying to get people to
not just be curious.

00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:26.550
Because I know I do
this all day.

00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:27.720
You get a link to something.

00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:28.540
This is pretty cool.

00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:29.580
Oh, Boing Boing.

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:30.700
Oh, it's a TomTom.

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:32.140
Anyway, I'll buy that later.

00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:33.460
And then they never do.

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:36.600
And the biggest thing that you
have to conquer is the idea of

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:39.330
people strictly being curious,
which is what most people are

00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:41.340
satisfied to do, to pick
something up and go, huh,

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:43.830
cool, anyway, and move on.

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:48.430
And that is still something that
I'm trying to conquer.

00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:52.350
And with Sword Club, we
did it a little bit.

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:56.160
The movie never turned into like
a overnight theatrical

00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:00.000
sensation, but it has since
picked up an afterlife on DVD.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.280
It was on Netflix for a while.

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:04.180
Now it's on Hulu.

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:07.400
Maybe it wants to
be on YouTube?

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:10.300
Legally.

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:15.760
So I realized that this sort of
thing has an outer limit.

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:18.320
When I was in Phoenix, and we
were still doing Sword Club,

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:20.120
it had become this weird
ritual at this point.

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:22.710
We'd go to whatever Walmart
was in our town.

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:24.050
We would sit down
with the swords.

00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:27.430
We would look up inspirational
quotes and be like, Elvis

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:32.990
said, and just do it like
a job at that point.

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:36.990
I ended up being in Arizona
all alone by myself doing

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:38.560
these Q&amp;As, because that's
where I'm from, and I was

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:39.560
staying with my family.

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:42.740
And I was getting a burrito one
night, and I saw a tattoo

00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:43.960
parlor across the road.

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:45.820
And I was like, that's
the next step--

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:47.780
Tattoo Club.

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:49.400
I was like, if people
come 10 times--

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:51.200
10 times--

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:55.420
I will get their name tattooed
somewhere on my body.

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:57.440
And so I announced
it that night.

00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.880
And I was basically--

00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:01.240
I don't know if you guys have
ever seen the documentary

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:03.780
"Hearts of Darkness" about
Francis Ford Coppola making

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:05.210
"Apocalypse Now?" You should
check it out if you haven't.

00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:06.800
But that's where I was at--

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:09.650
like Francis Ford Coppola mid
shooting "Apocalypse Now." I'm

00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:11.650
like, tattoos, that'll
make it happen.

00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:14.160
That'll take us over the top.

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:15.890
And so I announced it.

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:18.890
And then I was like, no one's
going to do it, right?

00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:20.070
Three kids.

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:22.320
Three kids went to the
movie 10 times.

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:24.580
And I was like, OK, cool, and
went back to LA and was like,

00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:26.680
I have to get a tattoo now.

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:28.860
And I kept in touch with them,
and after about a year, I was

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:30.390
like, guys, I can't get it.

00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:31.220
I can't do it.

00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:32.250
I just can't.

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:33.650
I'll make it up to
you somehow.

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:36.770
And then they're thanked
in my new book.

00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:39.330
I apologize to them in the
acknowledgements section--

00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:40.540
Tattoo Club, by name--

00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:43.930
and I plan to do it pretty much
with every book since,

00:37:43.930 --> 00:37:46.330
because that's the only
permanent thing I have to

00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:47.030
offer anyone.

00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:48.525
Because nobody wants
to be on my thigh.

00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:51.770
So--

00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:54.710
AUDIENCE: You should do it.

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:55.920
DC PIERSON: [LAUGHING]

00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:56.710
I can't.

00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:58.110
I can't do it.

00:37:58.110 --> 00:37:59.830
I have to do so many
nude scenes.

00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:00.245
I'm sorry?

00:38:00.245 --> 00:38:01.670
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:03.120
DC PIERSON: Fair enough.

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:03.570
Totally.

00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:07.046
You could say that
about anything.

00:38:07.046 --> 00:38:08.890
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:11.330
DC PIERSON: Oooooooh!

00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:13.360
For those of you watching at
home, that guy just said, a

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:15.040
lot of people say it, not a
lot of people ever do it.

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:16.290
Fair enough, sir.

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:25.890
I am, like I said, a stand-up
and an author and an actor.

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:28.590
And I started doing storytelling
stuff.

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:31.760
I do a storytelling show called
"DC Pierson is Bad at

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:35.030
Girls," about how bad
I am at girls.

00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:38.550
I started rapping a little bit
on some of Donald's early

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:40.860
albums, because I'm a huge hip
hop fan, and it was something

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:42.150
that I'd always wanted to do.

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:45.170
And so I still get the
occasional Twitter at reply

00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:48.280
from somebody being
like, you suck.

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:49.790
And a few people being
like, you're awesome.

00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:52.590
But a lot of people being like,
why did you do that?

00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:55.810
Um, serious.

00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:59.670
And when it came time to sell
this new book, "Crap Kingdom,"

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:03.160
to people in general, I was
like, what do I do?

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:07.310
I don't have a lot of money
to hire a publicist.

00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:08.660
I'm all these different
things.

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:11.850
How do I explain that to people,
and make it into

00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:13.060
something that is appealing
to them,

00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:14.580
instead of just confusing?

00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:16.810
Because it seems like it could
be a lot of messages.

00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:22.910
And what I realized about what
I wanted to do with this book

00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:28.585
in terms of actually getting
people to buy it was all of

00:39:28.585 --> 00:39:30.010
that stuff.

00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:31.260
All of the stuff.

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:37.820
And I've been living my life for
the past almost 10 years

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:40.720
now with a bunch of different
irons in the fire, and going,

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:42.550
like, when one of these irons
gets hot enough, then I'll be

00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:45.190
rich, and that'll finance doing
all these other things.

00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:47.090
And it hasn't happened yet.

00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:52.260
And what I realized is that
instead of kind of just going

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:54.100
like, OK, it's just going to
be one of these irons from

00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:55.200
here on out--

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.100
I have these irons.

00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:58.290
They've all been in the
fire for a long time.

00:39:58.290 --> 00:39:59.430
They're pretty hot.

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:00.830
They really are.

00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:02.180
They're all pretty hot.

00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:06.310
And at this point, I'm
like, fuck the fire.

00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:07.375
My irons are hot.

00:40:07.375 --> 00:40:09.260
They're the fire now.

00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:12.180
My irons are the fire.

00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:16.230
And to that end, what I've been
doing to promote this

00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:18.330
book, to get people to pre-order
it, among other

00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:21.810
things, is if anybody pre-orders
my book before

00:40:21.810 --> 00:40:26.060
March 7, which is this coming
Thursday, I've been writing

00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:30.240
their names, their full names,
into custom rap songs that I

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:33.320
then perform and
put on YouTube.

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:35.310
I've done 100 so far.

00:40:35.310 --> 00:40:37.650
I do 50 names per song.

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:40.980
And people seem to enjoy it.

00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:44.130
And it is that thing of being,
like, don't just be curious.

00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:46.320
It's that thing of fighting the
weed and the doughnuts,

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:47.570
and being like, wouldn't
you rather have

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:48.840
a custom rap instead?

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:51.570
And the book, coming out March
7, which is really good and

00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:52.820
funny, and you'll like it.

00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:57.390
And it's been going
pretty well.

00:40:57.390 --> 00:41:00.700
I owe a lot of raps,
but they're coming.

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:02.190
I wrote the third one, finished

00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:04.200
the third one yesterday.

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:06.280
And it's been great.

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:08.560
It's been really, really,
really, really cool.

00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:11.980
A couple of the other things
that I'm doing in terms of my

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:14.010
various irons--

00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:16.670
I had like 30 minutes of
stand-up up that I've

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:19.070
developed over the past couple
years, just to try to be a

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:21.340
stand-up and to try to get on
TV, try to get famous for

00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:23.470
doing stand-up and whatever.

00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:27.760
And this year, I auditioned
to try to get a special on

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:28.330
television.

00:41:28.330 --> 00:41:29.450
Didn't happen.

00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:31.550
And I was mad about it, because
I was like, this is

00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:31.940
really good.

00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:32.990
I worked really hard.

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:35.230
You know, how the yearbook staff
will do in high school,

00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:36.800
when you're like, my name is
misspelled, and they're like,

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:39.250
yeah, but we work really hard!

00:41:39.250 --> 00:41:40.460
But I was like, I did
work really hard.

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:41.100
I'm really proud of it.

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:42.600
I want to put it out there.

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:44.390
And I was like, oh, I have
this book coming out.

00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:45.410
How do those two
things relate?

00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:49.630
And I was like, oh, if enough
people pre-order the book,

00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:51.900
I'll put the stand
up out there.

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:53.100
And that's what I'm
doing right now.

00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:56.260
I'm having an offer where if 100
people pre-order the book,

00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:59.280
I'll put that stand-up special
for free on YouTube.

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.220
And I'm about a quarter of
the way there, and I

00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:03.580
announced it yesterday.

00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:08.340
And again with the rap stuff,
there have been for every five

00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:10.190
people that are like, you suck,
there's one guy that's

00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:11.740
like, when are you going
to put out a mix tape?

00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:14.770
And I wrote and recorded one
over the course of like two

00:42:14.770 --> 00:42:17.180
years just completely as a
hobby, because I know there's

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:18.825
a lot of people that are like,
you suck, but there's one dude

00:42:18.825 --> 00:42:20.290
that's being like, you're
all right, man.

00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:22.500
And I was doing it
for that kid.

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:23.160
And I did it.

00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:26.280
And I announced if 50 people
pre-order my book, I'll put

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:29.200
out my first mix tape, like that
one kid has been saying

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:30.270
he wanted all those years.

00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:31.280
And they did.

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:32.100
It happened last week.

00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:33.270
50 more people pre-ordered it.

00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:36.300
They sent me their receipts to
crapkingdom@gmail.com, which

00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:37.870
is where you send your receipt
if you want your name written

00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:41.030
into a custom rap song.

00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:41.845
And they did.

00:42:41.845 --> 00:42:43.390
And I put the mix tape out.

00:42:43.390 --> 00:42:44.530
And it's been getting
feedback.

00:42:44.530 --> 00:42:45.960
And have a track on there
where I'm like,

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:47.840
please buy my book.

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:49.760
And when I put the stand-up out
there, it's going to come

00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:51.880
with a little wrapper on it
that's me being-- not a rapper

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:54.000
like rapper, but a wrapper like
a little bumper at the

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.150
beginning-- it's like,
please buy my book.

00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:57.450
I'm putting this out
there for free.

00:42:57.450 --> 00:43:00.510
Or if you have already
bought it, thank you.

00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:01.980
I did the same thing with
my storytelling show.

00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:03.330
I taped it a couple weeks ago.

00:43:03.330 --> 00:43:05.880
And next week, I'm going to
announce that if 100 people

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:08.040
pre-order my book, I'll
put it out there.

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:13.390
And it is kind of my little
homemade way of trying to

00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:17.940
create the feeling that movies
or TV shows or celebrities can

00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:21.010
create because they have money
and time, and they can be

00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:21.840
everywhere.

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:24.000
I'm trying to, for those people
that have been checking

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.660
for me over the years-- that
one kid who's like, you're

00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:26.650
pretty all right--

00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:29.210
I'm trying to create that
feeling for him of, like,

00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:31.140
here's all the stuff I've
been working on.

00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:33.200
Here's all the irons
in the fire.

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:36.530
And then on March 7, they get
a book, and I think they're

00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:37.510
going to like it.

00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:43.490
And I didn't realize it
until I sat down to

00:43:43.490 --> 00:43:45.645
prepare this today.

00:43:48.584 --> 00:43:54.010
But it feels very appropriate
to me to kind of finally be

00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:58.140
opening all of the portal doors
and letting all of the

00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:01.190
gnomes and elves and dragons
from my various worlds that

00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:03.480
I've been cultivating over the
years, let them pour out and

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:06.900
let them help me try to have
a lot of people read

00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:08.090
and enjoy this book.

00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:10.810
It feels appropriate, because
the book is about the problems

00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:13.620
of living in two worlds, and
I've been living the problems

00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:14.770
of living in a lot of different

00:44:14.770 --> 00:44:16.940
worlds for many years.

00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:19.590
And I like that I'm finally
bringing it all together.

00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:21.060
Hopefully, I think it's
going pretty well.

00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:23.860
I like that I'm bringing it all
together to actually sell

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:25.760
this book that is about
living in two worlds.

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:34.950
And sort of, I guess, in
summation, I realized in

00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:38.240
preparing this speech
that I wouldn't--

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:41.010
because I've had to over the
years, or sometimes just in my

00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:42.510
mind and sometimes out loud--

00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:47.620
defend the idea that I need to
do all these things that I do,

00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:49.690
when maybe I should
just do one and

00:44:49.690 --> 00:44:52.240
wouldn't that be enough?

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:56.680
But everything is everything,
and I wouldn't be all of the

00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:59.420
things that I am without-- or
I wouldn't be any of the

00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:02.680
things that I am without being
all of the things that I am.

00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:07.340
And lions are cool, and witches
are cool, but you

00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:11.010
wouldn't get to see any of
them without a wardrobe.

00:45:11.010 --> 00:45:14.980
And to paraphrase "Pulp
Fiction," I am trying real

00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:18.700
hard to be the wardrobe.

00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:19.600
Thanks,

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:26.140
guys, [APPLAUSE]

00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:28.055
MALE SPEAKER: So I think DC
will take some questions--

00:45:28.055 --> 00:45:28.360
DC PIERSON: Sweet.

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:29.980
MALE SPEAKER: --if
anybody has any.

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:31.850
I'm going to get a marker,
[INAUDIBLE].

00:45:31.850 --> 00:45:35.050
AUDIENCE: My question is,
obviously, you do occupy all

00:45:35.050 --> 00:45:37.750
these different worlds that you
talked about, and you do

00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:39.390
them all very well.

00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:43.820
Have you ever ventured into sort
of your own crap kingdom?

00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:47.160
Is there a world that you have
tried to sort of occupy, and

00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:47.850
it didn't go great?

00:45:47.850 --> 00:45:48.620
Because it seems like--

00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:49.390
DC PIERSON: Well, I write
for award shows a lot.

00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:49.880
AUDIENCE: What was that?

00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:50.940
DC PIERSON: I write for
award shows a lot.

00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:53.790
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHING]

00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:55.625
DC PIERSON: For scratch,
for money.

00:45:55.625 --> 00:45:58.790
No, but even that is kind of
fun, because I get a lot of

00:45:58.790 --> 00:46:01.300
great stories out
of it and stuff.

00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:04.020
I met Gary Busey once.

00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:05.880
That was exciting.

00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:13.320
No, I mean, I don't know.

00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:16.560
I guess as far as the things
that I don't want to do, I

00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:23.200
hesitate to write a lot of stuff
where I'm shitting on

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:25.190
things that other people do,
because I feel like there's

00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:26.530
enough of that out there.

00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:30.200
And I definitely know people
that are artists and do, on

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:32.530
their Twitter feeds, like, this
sucks, or this whatever.

00:46:32.530 --> 00:46:35.260
I guess I do a little bit of
that, but it always feels like

00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:37.670
a., just sort of on a practical
level, you could

00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:39.950
potentially alienate people who
might later employ you, so

00:46:39.950 --> 00:46:44.050
just from a coward's point of
view, I don't like to do that.

00:46:44.050 --> 00:46:45.190
I try not to do that.

00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:47.320
Sometimes I can't help it.

00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:52.160
But then also, it seems like
really bad karmic strategy, in

00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:57.480
terms of putting that out there,
and then if somebody

00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:59.345
were to do that to me, I'd be
like, hey, man, come on.

00:46:59.345 --> 00:47:02.360
I'm just trying to
make a thing.

00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:06.140
But there haven't, thankfully,
been too many things that I

00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:13.460
have gone full bore into that
I haven't liked or wanted to

00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:15.716
stick around for.

00:47:15.716 --> 00:47:18.870
I mean, certain relationships.

00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:20.894
But yeah.

00:47:20.894 --> 00:47:22.295
It's a great question.

00:47:22.295 --> 00:47:24.170
Yes.

00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:27.000
AUDIENCE: So I have a friend
who loves that quote,

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.320
everything is everything,
and I never really

00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:30.575
understood what she meant.

00:47:30.575 --> 00:47:33.243
Because I was like, that
sounds repetitive.

00:47:33.243 --> 00:47:34.090
DC PIERSON: Right.

00:47:34.090 --> 00:47:35.330
AUDIENCE: So thank you
for clarifying that.

00:47:35.330 --> 00:47:36.840
Actually, that makes a lot
of sense and totally

00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:39.080
resonates with me.

00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:41.660
And so in that vein, since
everything that you do

00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:45.230
contributes to who you are as an
artist, when can we expect

00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:46.360
to see those tattoos?

00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:50.790
DC PIERSON: [LAUGHING]

00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:51.670
Oh, nice!

00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:52.920
OK, that guys just said henna.

00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:54.170
Yeah, totally.

00:47:56.790 --> 00:47:57.880
That's a really good question.

00:47:57.880 --> 00:47:59.460
So what you're saying,
basically, is that if I were

00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:00.855
to actually get the tattoos--

00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:10.200
which are owed to Jeremy
Seeliger, Darryl Seeliger, and

00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:16.430
Jason Artigas, whose names
are tattooed in here--

00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:18.500
that that would enrich
my artistic process.

00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:23.500
I don't know that it would.

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:35.450
And it just seemed like a lot
to explain to a girl on a

00:48:35.450 --> 00:48:36.700
third date, hopefully?

00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:43.440
Why do you have three
dudes' names?

00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:45.220
However you dress them up--

00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:47.380
you can put them in flames
coming out of a motorcycle

00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:51.270
being driven by a dragon,
but they're still--

00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:52.320
yeah, I don't know.

00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:53.640
I don't think I can do it.

00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:56.000
I think I'm going to have to
continue putting them in the

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.210
acknowledgements of
things, or working

00:48:58.210 --> 00:48:59.060
their names into things.

00:48:59.060 --> 00:48:59.820
And I think they're
cool with that.

00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:00.860
We talk over email.

00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:02.220
I think they're all
right with it.

00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:03.730
I don't think any of them
are too mad at me.

00:49:06.250 --> 00:49:08.000
One of the guys was like,
yeah, I get it.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:08.220
It's cool.

00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:11.400
He was like, I didn't expect
you to actually do it.

00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:14.611
And then I was like,
maybe I will do it.

00:49:14.611 --> 00:49:15.970
Does that make sense?

00:49:15.970 --> 00:49:17.850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:17.850 --> 00:49:19.317
DC PIERSON: I got some good
orange water here.

00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:30.420
AUDIENCE: So I was wondering,
do you see your lifestyle as

00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:33.300
something that might be viable
for others in the future, like

00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:37.540
a multi-talented individual
that doesn't have to be

00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:40.670
monolithically Hollywood
centralized famous but can

00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:43.530
still make a living off
of kind of more

00:49:43.530 --> 00:49:46.230
democratized media?

00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:48.180
DC PIERSON: That's
a great question.

00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:52.300
I was just, again, thinking
about this last night, when I

00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:56.090
was prepping.

00:49:56.090 --> 00:50:02.100
Because the whole reason that I
have been doing all of this

00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:03.770
pre-order campaign and
everything like that is

00:50:03.770 --> 00:50:05.650
because I do want the book
to be a success.

00:50:05.650 --> 00:50:08.330
I want it to really be a thing
where it's like, this is a

00:50:08.330 --> 00:50:10.470
"New York Times" best
selling everything.

00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:15.980
I do want that, in a very,
very I guess cynical--

00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:19.610
or not cynical, but just very
singularly focused, Daniel Day

00:50:19.610 --> 00:50:23.360
Lewis in "There Will Be Blood."
Not that I'll smash

00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:28.270
somebody's head in over
it, but I do want it

00:50:28.270 --> 00:50:30.550
to be a real success.

00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:31.250
I do.

00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:34.630
It's just that I don't know of
any other way to build that

00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:38.400
except for using all of the
other stuff that I've done.

00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:40.930
I don't think it would be
terribly effective to take out

00:50:40.930 --> 00:50:45.912
a bank loan to buy $20,000 worth
of Facebook banners.

00:50:45.912 --> 00:50:48.450
I do feel like the best way that
that sort of thing can

00:50:48.450 --> 00:50:50.200
spread is somebody being
like, hey, look at

00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:54.510
this, to their friend.

00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:56.000
Hey, come check this thing out,
because they're given

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.550
away swords.

00:50:57.550 --> 00:50:58.800
Sweet.

00:51:01.830 --> 00:51:04.460
But I do think that that's
definitely a viable option,

00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:09.790
and it's something that, as much
as I am still listening

00:51:09.790 --> 00:51:12.160
to Jerry Howard in my head being
like, just get famous,

00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:15.050
doesn't matter for what, no--

00:51:15.050 --> 00:51:17.830
I mean, I'm in an Allstate
commercial, dude.

00:51:17.830 --> 00:51:21.160
It doesn't matter for what.

00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:22.410
It really doesn't.

00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:27.630
I do think that-- let's say none
of that stuff happens.

00:51:27.630 --> 00:51:31.990
Let's say that it sort of
comes out and it doesn't

00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:34.180
immediately hit the top of the
charts, which is very unlikely

00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:36.680
that it will, as much
stuff as I've tried.

00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:39.220
It's just really, really, really
mysterious, and the

00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:41.590
algorithm that they
use to compile it

00:51:41.590 --> 00:51:43.830
is shrouded in mystery.

00:51:43.830 --> 00:51:46.340
Although maybe it doesn't
have to be--

00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:46.725
dcpierson@gmail.com.

00:51:46.725 --> 00:51:47.975
Hit me up, Google employes.

00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:54.090
But if it doesn't happen, I was
thinking about it, and I

00:51:54.090 --> 00:51:58.620
was like, oh, this sort of
campaign architecture that

00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:02.120
I've put in place in a very sort
of haphazard jury rigged

00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:05.030
kind of way throughout trying to
put this pre-order campaign

00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:07.960
together, it doesn't go away
once the book comes out.

00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:10.400
If anything, it continues to
help me stay in touch with

00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:11.260
those people.

00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:13.580
And all I have in terms
of people that

00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:14.770
go and by the book--

00:52:14.770 --> 00:52:17.550
most people that go and buy the
book, when they email me

00:52:17.550 --> 00:52:20.170
about it, they aren't buying it
just because they heard me

00:52:20.170 --> 00:52:21.300
on a single podcast and they've

00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:22.630
never heard of me before.

00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:24.970
Although that's happening
in some cases.

00:52:24.970 --> 00:52:27.940
Or they're seeing a single
tweet or whatever.

00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:31.470
It's that they have seen a
tweet by somebody, maybe

00:52:31.470 --> 00:52:36.460
somebody famous they follow, and
they remember me from when

00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:37.940
they were watching Derrick
videos when they were in

00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:41.730
college, like this point
like seven years ago.

00:52:41.730 --> 00:52:42.960
And it's great.

00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:44.710
It really is.

00:52:44.710 --> 00:52:46.870
Every time I can get in front
of your face is awesome,

00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:49.110
whether that's in the Allstate
commercial or whether that's

00:52:49.110 --> 00:52:52.800
in a dick and fart video from
seven years ago or whatever,

00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:56.480
it all sort of when you see that
next thing, where it's

00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:57.900
like, oh, that guy again.

00:52:57.900 --> 00:52:59.440
It all sort of builds to that.

00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:00.770
And so I do think that--

00:53:00.770 --> 00:53:03.215
let's say it isn't just a smash
out of the gate success.

00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:11.080
I will get to continue to do
these kinds of things, for

00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:11.760
their own sake.

00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:15.100
And I wouldn't even be getting
to do the strategy that I'm

00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:19.310
talking about, where I put out a
mix tape and a special and a

00:53:19.310 --> 00:53:22.430
storytelling show and whatever,
if I hadn't been

00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:25.990
doing those things over the
past five years just

00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:29.120
for their own sake.

00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:32.840
I guess the short
answer is yes.

00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:34.740
MALE SPEAKER: We can take maybe
one more question if

00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:36.090
anybody has a burning
question.

00:53:36.090 --> 00:53:37.890
Otherwise--

00:53:37.890 --> 00:53:39.295
DC PIERSON: Tempting fate.

00:53:39.295 --> 00:53:39.740
MALE SPEAKER: Huh?

00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:40.050
DC PIERSON: Tempting fate.

00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:41.020
There might not be
another question.

00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:42.380
MALE SPEAKER: [LAUGHING]

00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:42.950
All right.

00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:44.650
Thank you, DC Pierson,
for coming to see us.

00:53:44.650 --> 00:53:45.120
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:46.530
DC PIERSON: Thanks, guys, Thank
you so much for coming.

00:53:46.530 --> 00:53:48.410
I really appreciate it.

00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:52.500
Sweet.

00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:53.750
Y'all want some books?
