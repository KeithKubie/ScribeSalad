[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.325 --> 00:00:08.283
KELLY REILLY: Thank you
so much for joining us.

00:00:08.283 --> 00:00:09.574
CLEMANTINE WAMARIYA: Thank you.

00:00:09.574 --> 00:00:10.540
KELLY REILLY: Yeah.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.770
CLEMANTINE WAMARIYA:
Hello, everyone.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:13.630
How are you?

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:14.350
I don't bite.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.880
You could move a little
bit closer if you want,

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.490
so I could see you.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.027
KELLY REILLY: Yeah.

00:00:23.027 --> 00:00:28.990
So Clemantine was just six
when the mass killing of 1994

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.030
broke out in Rwanda.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.580
And she spent-- she
tells her wonderful story

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.470
in the book "The Girl
Who Smiled Beads"

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.410
of moving from country
to country in Africa,

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.200
and eventually to the
United States, to Yale,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.752
to tell here story.

00:00:42.752 --> 00:00:44.710
So we're going to tell
a little bit about that.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.918
We're going to go into the
narrative of "The Girl Who

00:00:46.918 --> 00:00:49.300
Smiled Beads" and talk
a little bit about what

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.180
it means for us, for identity,
for building community,

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.470
for forging connections.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.310
So with that, we'll kick off.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.354
So your life has been so dynamic
and full of accomplishments.

00:01:01.354 --> 00:01:03.520
So this might be one of the
least interesting things

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.965
about you, but you
were a Googler.

00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:08.090
I think the audience would
love to know about that.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.090
Can you tell us a bit
about your time at Google?

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.140
CLEMANTINE WAMARIYA: Yes.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.820
Well, first of all,
I want to say thank

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.020
you so much for having me.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.910
It's such a pleasure.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.570
And Kelly has gone above
and beyond to get me here,

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:20.690
to get the bookstore.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.280
So thank you so much for
having me and connecting--

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.980
reconnecting me back
to the community.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.420
And all of you, thank you
so much for taking the train

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.880
and being here, taking some
time from the office to be here.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.380
So I really appreciate it.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.500
And for everybody who's
viewing live, hello.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.260
Thank you for pausing and
to come and to listen.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.660
So my tour this fall
is Listening Tour.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.760
And so I'm doing a lot of
listening, as well as sharing

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.790
about "The Girl
Who Smiled Beads."

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.070
And it's so wonderful
to come back

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.210
to Google not to come to
hang out with my friend

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.650
and eat the food here, because
that's what I usually do,

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.150
but to come and share the book.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:22.480
I interned with Google Bold
in 2010 in San Francisco.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.530
And one of my mentors,
mentee as well,

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.840
Theresa, invited me
to the community.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.470
And I had so much fun.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.400
I connected with people
from all over the world.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.340
As you know, Google Bold
is super diverse, and not

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.120
only in different places
where you come from,

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.520
but also just perspective.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.750
And I fell in love
with San Francisco.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.192
But with Google, I was
like, oh, well, maybe I

00:02:52.192 --> 00:02:54.400
could go to South Africa
and do the same thing that I

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.050
was doing here at Google.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.420
And I was with Dot Org
and marketing team.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.670
And I was telling Kelly earlier
that I spent so much time

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.130
on the internet
trying to get so many

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.910
non-profits and small
businesses on a Google map.

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.350
So if you are a
non-profit and you

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.070
were on a Google Map
between 2010 and '11,

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.940
I'm that girl who made
sure that you were there.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.920
And yeah.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.770
But even that, so I've been
with the Content Creator Summit

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.720
for the past four years.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.370
And I've been traveling
back and forth

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.170
and meeting all these
incredible content

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.910
creators with YouTube in London,
and in LA, and here in New York

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:43.510
as well.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.426
KELLY REILLY: Very much
part of the community,

00:03:45.426 --> 00:03:46.960
a part of the family.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.430
So onto the book.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.310
The first episodes of
your life in Rwanda

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.810
are one of a totally
idyllic childhood.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.670
Can you paint a picture
for the audience

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.230
of what your childhood
was like maybe

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.119
through images of
your mother's garden

00:03:58.119 --> 00:04:00.160
or through the stories
your nanny would tell you?

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.201
CLEMANTINE WAMARIYA: Yes.

00:04:01.201 --> 00:04:04.000
How many of you have had
a chance to read the book?

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.510
All right.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.600
This is good.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.750
So half of you.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.540
So I had a childhood that
I would wish for anybody.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.510
And I have--

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.370
I grew up in nine
different countries,

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.570
and I have traveled to about
20 something countries.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.620
And the childhood that I had,
I wished it for my friends,

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.900
for my family, for anyone.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:37.690
And that means where you
feel accepted by everybody.

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.280
And those who don't accept
you, at least for me,

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.720
I didn't know what that was
like, except one instance

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.695
that I had.

00:04:47.695 --> 00:04:49.600
But a really great
example that I will

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.950
give you growing up in Kigali--

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.390
actually, two examples.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:01.060
One, our home, my
mother, I think maybe

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.040
after she married
my dad, she had

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.210
this idea of creating
the Garden of Eden

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.020
right in front of our house.

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.460
And so if you had to
come to our house,

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.700
my mom would have asked
you where you're from,

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.464
and you would say,
I'm from this place.

00:05:14.464 --> 00:05:15.880
And then after
that, she was like,

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.540
so what flower is the
flower from your state

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:20.560
or your country?

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.370
What fruit?

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.130
And my mom would engineer--

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.590
would ask you to bring the
seed, or she'll find it,

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.100
and then would engineer
the flower or the plant,

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.610
whatever it is.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.370
And so when you
come back next time,

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.980
you find the plant
of your country

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.030
or your state in our garden.

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.050
So I grew up with all
these different flowers

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.590
from all over the world, all
these different fruits, all

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.490
these different vegetables,
because my mother had this goal

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.440
of creating the Garden of Eden.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.800
She just didn't like the story
ending where Adam and Eve have

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.120
to walk out of the garden.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.990
She was like, nope,
we're not doing that.

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.390
So that's my mother.

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:04.660
And I always feel like
she's a soil whisperer.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.530
And she just is able
to grow anything.

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:11.500
And I spent some time
with her sending me.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.340
Go get this.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:13.030
Go do this.

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.150
Go do that.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.990
And so I grew up really
understanding the world

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.110
through flowers and
the world through all

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.700
these different plants.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:27.790
And another one, we had
this very young bride, maybe

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:31.150
she was 20 or 21.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.190
And she wanted to have children.

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:38.200
But for some reason, not yet,
because she was 20 something.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.270
But I remember on
weekends she would cook.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.130
I mean, she would
wake up and cook.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.050
And she would have
all kinds of treats--

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:50.260
I'm not sure if you know
bhajia and beignet--

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.680
and make lots of
like biryani rice,

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.160
because she was half
Rwandan, half Indian.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.160
And so she would make all
this biryani with rice,

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.150
with vegetables.

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.310
And she would make samosa.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.690
And then she would just
take this giant plate

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:07.210
and she would just bang it.

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:10.840
And all of us, I mean,
maybe like 20, 25 kids,

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.630
would all go and
just line up and eat.

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:15.950
And she'd play music for us.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.730
And so that is the
childhood that I had.

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.900
And I thought that
everyone, you know, everyone

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.790
in my neighborhood,
that's how they lived,

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:29.200
except this one person,
who I went to their house.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.820
And they were having lunch.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.290
And they didn't feed me.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:35.020
And my mom had told me
never to go there for lunch.

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:39.670
And I remember coming back.

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:40.660
And I was so sad.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:41.709
And I was crying.

00:07:41.709 --> 00:07:43.750
And my mom was like, I
told you never to go there

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:45.650
for lunch or dinner.

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:48.550
And I'm like, what is
it that she has done?

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:51.590
It was like--
[SPEAKING KINYARWANDA]

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:56.080
in Kinyarwanda means to separate
yourself from the creator.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.600
That means to not share.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:06.070
And so I grew up in a place
where sharing and connecting,

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:10.240
not only with your
neighbors, your friends.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:14.860
From the minute that I was
aware that I was conscious

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.260
and I was human,
that was the way.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.059
That was my childhood.

00:08:19.059 --> 00:08:21.350
KELLY REILLY: But things
changed for you very early on.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:23.474
You have that beautiful
story about your childhood,

00:08:23.474 --> 00:08:26.200
and then war broke out.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.450
You were forced from your
home with your older sister,

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:30.970
just the two of you,
out in the world.

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:35.049
You lived in several refugee
camps in Burundi, Tanzania,

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:36.096
Malawi.

00:08:36.096 --> 00:08:37.929
What was the day to day
reality like for you

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:41.190
in those situations?

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:48.490
CLEMANTINE WAMARIYA: Well, it's
taken me about 20 something

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:51.100
years to be able
to get to a place

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:55.300
where, first, I could
talk about it, and then,

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:59.580
second, I could be able
to rationalize about it.

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:03.850
And this is why I wrote
"The Girl Who Smiled Beads."

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:05.380
I wrote "The Girl
Who Smiled Beads,"

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:11.560
because I thought in all
the places and everything

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:17.230
that happened to us, I was just
an observer taking it all in.

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:20.860
And now sitting here with you
and in front of all of you,

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:24.200
I'm realizing that's
actually, in fact, true.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:31.610
So some of you may know what
happened in Rwanda in 1994,

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:35.270
where millions of
people were murdered.

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:39.180
And millions others were
displaced all over the world.

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:49.700
And it's because we believed in
a story and in the propaganda

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:53.570
that this person is less than.

00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:02.230
That's why we got into
a place where neighbors

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:03.880
turned against each other.

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:10.480
Neighbors killed
their neighbors.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.290
Friends killed their friends.

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:17.660
But also, there are those people
who decided not to do that.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:21.470
And all of it, as a
result from deep lack

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:28.990
of abundance in being human.

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:31.750
At least that's how I say it.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:36.640
And it's something as a child,
of course, I didn't understand.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:37.810
I couldn't even comprehend.

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:40.270
Even as an adult,
I don't understand

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:45.820
how a husband could kill
a wife and the children

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:51.640
because someone said that
they're Tutsi, or an ideology,

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.550
of course, in the practice.

00:10:54.550 --> 00:11:00.080
But learning about
it through books

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:03.860
later on as a college
student and a little bit

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:06.650
as a high school student,
I couldn't understand it.

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:10.670
So I started
studying more of what

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:14.720
has happened in different parts
of Europe, the Holocaust, what

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.130
has happened in Cambodia,
what has happened

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:19.580
in different parts of South
America, what's even happened

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:20.870
here.

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:23.750
Today is the Indigenous
Peoples' Day,

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:26.960
and thinking about that
that's not far away.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.720
We are not far away
from that in itself.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:34.280
So what happened here in
America also happened in Rwanda,

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:37.730
but what happened
in Rwanda was 1994.

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:42.650
And my older sister
and I were a few

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:45.230
of the people who
were able to escape

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:48.050
at the beginning
of the conflict.

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:53.570
And my sister Claire
was 15 at the time.

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:54.710
I was six.

00:11:54.710 --> 00:12:01.400
And for the next six years and
a half, we went from a country

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.770
to another seeking refuge.

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:08.540
And what is the day to day
of a person seeking a refuge?

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.770
I've written all about it.

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:18.800
I've gotten closer
to paint words,

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:22.080
and to be able to make you feel.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.660
And not just only to
help you intellectualize

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:28.340
who did it when and where.

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:29.990
To be a person who's
seeking a refuge,

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:31.400
you do not have
a piece of paper.

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.610
In fact, when I go to a
bar or a club sometimes

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:37.520
and they ask me for my ID,
it's such a huge trigger.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.570
I'm like, [GASPING],,
do I have an ID?

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:41.360
Because my whole life was that.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.680
We had to go from one
country to another.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:47.510
And if you don't have
an identification card,

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:49.880
then you were sent
to jail, or you

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:53.240
were put in a prison,
which is a jail or a prison

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:58.000
or a refugee camp, which
is equivalent of prison.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.680
And life in-- you walk.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.220
You wake up.

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.060
You walk.

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:07.430
And you sleep outside.

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:13.380
And you feel-- at least
for me as a child,

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:19.100
I felt very ashamed that
there were all these homes,

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:24.530
and we were not allowed
to be in it or near it.

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:29.210
And now as an adult, I still
feel that sense of how in which

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:33.850
we separate ourselves, that
some people have homes.

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:34.850
Some people have papers.

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:37.250
And some people
don't have papers.

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.460
And in a refugee camp--

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:44.000
oh, my goodness-- I cannot
wait for people to come forward

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.400
and share and add to "The
Girl Who Smiled Beads"

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.560
and tell you what
the life is like.

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:52.850
It's not a life that
I wish for anybody.

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:57.530
And of course, seeking
refuge in the United States,

00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:59.450
we came in 2000.

00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:03.990
Claire and I came in 2000 after
living in all those countries.

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:07.100
And we came with the
Organization International

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:11.390
Migration, which resettles
people who were seeking refuge

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:13.040
all over the world.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:21.040
And it was a moment to be
able to pause, definitely.

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.360
And so I hope that I have
answered your question.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.007
I was kind of trying to cover
all ground for everybody.

00:14:26.007 --> 00:14:27.340
KELLY REILLY: You certainly did.

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:28.798
Well, it's so
remarkable how you've

00:14:28.798 --> 00:14:32.960
turned such a powerful
and unfair situation

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:36.080
into a platform that so
hope-inducing for all of us.

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.210
It's super inspirational.

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:40.050
But you mentioned
themes of self-identity.

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:42.500
And that's super relevant to
this group, because for Women

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:44.060
in America's platforms,
we talk a lot

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:47.930
about both self-identity
and forging connections.

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:49.710
So on the topic
of self-identity,

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:51.830
I wanted to ask you
about your experience

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:54.860
that you write about in
"The Girl Who Smiled Beads."

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.630
You and Claire are
constantly trying

00:14:56.630 --> 00:15:00.320
to forge your own self-identity
despite these really

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.430
challenging circumstances.

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:05.325
And two scenes that struck
me as particularly visceral

00:15:05.325 --> 00:15:07.820
evocations of that
were when you were

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:11.370
first in a refugee camp,
six or seven years old,

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:13.280
and you were writing
your name in the sand,

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.177
saying it to anybody
who would listen,

00:15:15.177 --> 00:15:16.760
constantly reminding
yourself that you

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.590
were an individual with a name.

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:21.290
And the second scene was
when you were in Illinois

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:23.439
and had to apply for
your identification

00:15:23.439 --> 00:15:24.980
and choose what name
to put on there.

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:26.155
CLEMANTINE WAMARIYA: Yeah.

00:15:26.155 --> 00:15:26.690
KELLY REILLY: What
can you tell us

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:29.060
about how your relationship
with your self-identity

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:31.820
has changed over your journey?

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:39.430
CLEMANTINE WAMARIYA: Well,
it's been an incredible work.

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:41.290
It's not easy.

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:44.200
Each one of us in this
room, I'm sure there

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.120
was a point where
we've had to pause

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.950
to be able to say, who am I?

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:49.690
Where am I?

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:55.405
The person or the color,
or whatever it is,

00:15:55.405 --> 00:15:59.020
the label to be able to
be you, you don't fit in.

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:00.730
You don't-- it's a box.

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:01.910
You want to come out.

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:05.080
And so each one of
us has different ways

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:10.000
to be able to really go deep
into ourselves into our soul.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.190
For me, I feel like
every year varies.

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:18.490
And I probably could
just talk about recently.

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:22.970
I think recently, maybe
about two years ago,

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:24.670
I went out on a tour.

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:28.720
I made up this tour for
myself, and went around,

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:33.710
and started talking
to students about,

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:35.440
we're going beyond labels.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:38.890
And the students had to
fill out all the labels

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:41.770
that they feel like
they fit in, but all the

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:46.460
labels that they don't
want to fit in anymore.

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:48.940
And so it was all
the labels based

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:52.570
on like your gender, your
sexuality, your race,

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:53.710
your class.

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:55.690
And so all the students
were teaching me.

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:57.148
I thought that I
was teaching them.

00:16:57.148 --> 00:16:59.730
They were actually teaching
me how to be within myself.

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:07.650
And so with Rwanda, through,
of course, colonialism, first,

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:11.260
it was the Germans, and
then after, it was Belgians.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:17.079
And all the German experiments
through like your skull,

00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:19.869
your da-da-da, your this, your
this, your this, and therefore

00:17:19.869 --> 00:17:23.079
you fall into an
Aryan-looking person, which

00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:26.089
means your Caucasian features.

00:17:26.089 --> 00:17:29.661
And so growing up
with that, like later

00:17:29.661 --> 00:17:30.910
on starting to learn about it.

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:34.120
Actually, I started learning
about it in the camp,

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.200
in the first camp.

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.480
And I didn't understand it.

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.229
It was something
about your wrists

00:17:39.229 --> 00:17:41.020
and something about
your legs and something

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:43.210
about your nose and
something about your hair.

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:44.900
And I was just so confused.

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:46.510
I didn't get it.

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:52.210
And as I become an adult,
I'm seeing these kind

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:55.480
of ways of being in America.

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:56.989
And I'm seeing it
in South America.

00:17:56.989 --> 00:17:58.030
And I'm seeing in Europe.

00:17:58.030 --> 00:18:00.790
And I'm like, what
is going on here?

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:04.330
Because when you are a
child, you're just a baby.

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:06.940
You just are beautiful.

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:10.870
And so the practice
for me in terms

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:14.740
of understanding my identity
has been really getting deep

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:16.690
into my senses.

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:18.805
So if you ever come
to any of my parties,

00:18:18.805 --> 00:18:21.760
they're like a
five-sense experience.

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:23.500
Try to go to the
sixth sense, which

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:25.600
means your really deep soul.

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:33.310
And so from smell to touch
to sight to all the things

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:36.055
that are making me here now.

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:45.500
And so to really understand that
with myself and that as myself,

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:49.220
there's such a short
period that I'm on this--

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:52.310
when I can still breathe,
and when I can still hear,

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:54.175
and when I can still see.

00:18:54.175 --> 00:18:56.960
And I'm going to take
advantage of that,

00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:01.520
and be able to remind my friends
and my family like how awesome

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:02.720
that is.

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:03.990
And that is my identity.

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:07.550
My identity that I'm
connected to every creature

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:10.910
and every person and
everything around me.

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:11.990
But it's not easy.

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:18.200
And that's why you forge your
identity beyond your skin

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.270
color.

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:22.040
And to be able to--

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.990
skin color itself is
really important--

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:28.600
but to know that
all under it's just

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:36.310
this gooiness of muscles
and bones and stuff.

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:39.060
Sometimes it's creepy
when you think about it.

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:43.490
You're like, oh, there it is,
just a skeleton walking around.

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:46.090
So I hope that I've
answered the question.

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:49.310
And I'm still trying
to figure it out.

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:55.360
But through many authors and
many musicians or artists,

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:59.620
I'm still trying to
learn how to be me

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:06.120
in this world, [INAUDIBLE]
that I am not present.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:08.149
KELLY REILLY: There is a
beautiful feedback loop

00:20:08.149 --> 00:20:10.440
with something that we talk
about a lot in the employee

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:13.560
resources groups, which is
imposter syndrome or a sense

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:15.270
of not belonging.

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:18.180
You write about this
a little in your book,

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:20.640
because you landed at
an elite boarding school

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:24.720
in Yale, where you had
to adjust to people's

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.640
expectations of you.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:29.700
You were very enthused by what
you were learning, but also

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:34.110
challenged to find a way to
fit in, or whether to fit in.

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:36.330
What can you tell
us for those of us

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:37.860
who struggle with
imposter syndrome

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:39.240
or a sense of belonging?

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:42.459
How did you get through to
thriving in those situations?

00:20:42.459 --> 00:20:44.000
CLEMANTINE WAMARIYA:
So one, I always

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.340
said as a child, that
was forced on me.

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:51.870
And so Claire telling
me, all right, we

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:53.820
are going to learn Swahili now.

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:57.450
So we have about a month.

00:20:57.450 --> 00:20:58.200
Go.

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:01.530
And having to learn Swahili,
having to learn Nyanja,

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:05.220
having to learn Zulu, having
to learn Portuguese so that we

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:06.820
don't get thrown in jail.

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:08.640
So that is a high stake.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:11.440
And the millions of people
right now all over the world who

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:15.150
are seeking refuge are going
through that as I'm speaking,

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:16.740
so that they can try to fit in.

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:18.420
Different outfits.

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:19.987
Cut your hair.

00:21:19.987 --> 00:21:20.820
You braid your hair.

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:21.980
You do all these
different things

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:23.640
to just get the
body to be accepted.

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:31.550
I would say that the
first thing as people

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:38.090
who have food, shelter, friends,
family, at least on Maslow's

00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:44.300
hierarchy, if you have the
basics, to be able to realize

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:48.380
how others trying to make you
feel like you don't belong,

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:50.800
it's an illusion.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.900
It's absolutely an illusion.

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:53.880
It's not real.

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:54.420
It's fake.

00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:00.830
It's all fake,
because when you are

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:07.170
stuck in only that place of
fear that you don't belong,

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:11.100
you miss the whole
grand of your being

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:14.030
and of other people's being.

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:15.530
That's what I've realized.

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:23.750
And two, all of us come from
this place called a womb.

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:27.290
Until, of course, there's
going to be AI walking around

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:28.980
very soon.

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:33.260
We need to get our, literally,
shit together as a human,

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:36.680
because if we cannot get
our act together as human,

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:40.580
how are we expecting to be with
this new beings that are going

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:42.890
to be entering our daily lives?

00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:45.590
Well, my phone now, like I
always say, where does it go?

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:46.640
Where did it go?

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:51.050
Like that is taking all
my data every single day.

00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:53.490
That could be a part of my
conscious in the future.

00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:56.330
And so therefore
for our generation,

00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:58.610
we have an opportunity
in our generation

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:01.850
to be able to pass through
all these different molds.

00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:07.250
And so within that, I ask you
to really read Audre Lorde.

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:09.860
Audre Lorde is phenomenal.

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:11.270
Everything by Audre Lorde.

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:15.260
But "Sister Outsider,"
it's incredible.

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:17.540
Octavia Butler.

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:19.490
All of Octavia Butler's books.

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:22.760
Buy all of them,
and sit, and listen.

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:24.380
Sometimes listen to it.

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:27.560
And just understand the way
in which she was programming

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:29.360
our moment.

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:35.840
And I also say sometimes
James Baldwin also adds

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:42.980
so much into our senses and
being present as a human,

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:47.540
but also as the people who
want to be liberated out

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:53.210
of this thing that we so
truly believe it's only us.

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:58.150
And then also I will
close out by saying this

00:23:58.150 --> 00:24:03.490
with this question of belonging.

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:07.640
You belong here as
much as I belong here.

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:11.290
I belong here as much
as you belong here.

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:16.260
I'm not better than you, and
you're not better than me.

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:18.560
And when you wake
up every morning--

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:20.090
at least, I could
speak for myself--

00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:23.000
when I wake up every morning,
that's my meditation.

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:29.060
And going beyond that,
it's also all the animals,

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:35.240
and everything that is
around us also belongs here.

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:40.340
It sounds very hippy, but I hope
that our generation will become

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:47.270
the biggest hippies the world
can possibly accommodate,

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:53.360
because we are able to
communicate with our phones

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.410
across channels.

00:24:57.010 --> 00:24:59.050
People right now are
viewing from I don't know.

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:00.900
Who knows where?

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:05.180
That was not the
case 10 years ago.

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:07.570
We need to take advantage
of all the resources

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:12.020
to be able to be in ourselves
and belong within ourselves

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:17.170
so that we could allow others to
feel that they belong as well.

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:18.119
So it's a practice.

00:25:18.119 --> 00:25:18.910
KELLY REILLY: Yeah.

00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:20.260
Do you guys feel up
for the challenge

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:21.940
of being the world's
biggest hippies?

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:22.522
CLEMANTINE WAMARIYA: Yeah.

00:25:22.522 --> 00:25:24.130
KELLY REILLY:
They're ready for it.

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:25.850
CLEMANTINE WAMARIYA: I
got a few heads out there.

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:27.490
KELLY REILLY: There's a topic
I'm dying to ask you about,

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:29.950
which is about storytelling
and connections.

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:32.470
One of the central tenets of
Women at America's platforms

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:36.250
is building connections
across diverse sets of people.

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:39.490
And you did such a
beautiful job in this book

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:42.940
of making a very deliberate
choice that you were never

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:46.210
elevated to superhero
or mythological figure.

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:49.690
You are a very real person going
through these very difficult

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:51.910
circumstances.

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:53.780
You're always emphasizing
your humanity.

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:55.570
And I think that's so powerful.

00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:58.330
What can you tell us about
storytelling and its power

00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:01.199
to draw connections
between people?

00:26:01.199 --> 00:26:02.740
CLEMANTINE WAMARIYA:
Oh, my goodness.

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:05.260
Storytelling.

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:06.820
We are stories.

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:10.540
We are storytellers by
everything we create.

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:12.160
What we are is what we create.

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.260
What we create is who we are.

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:16.630
Sometimes we think you
are different from it,

00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:18.790
but we're not.

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:22.930
Well, speaking for
myself, I should say,

00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:27.820
I grew up with this
amazing caregiver.

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:30.670
Her name was Mukamana.

00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:37.030
Mukamana, probably, she came to
live with us maybe right when

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:38.380
I was just born.

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:42.900
And she sang to me probably
when I was a baby a lot,

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:46.630
but then as an adult, as like--
not an adult, as just a little,

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:50.150
when I started
taking in the world.

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:52.660
I remember my first time.

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:57.490
I literally remember my
first time noticing the sun.

00:26:57.490 --> 00:27:00.220
I walked outside, and I remember
looking at it just like I'm

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:03.190
looking at this light,
and then burning, and just

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:04.810
my eyes burning.

00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:05.770
And I walked in.

00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:07.630
And I was screaming.

00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:09.090
And I was like, what is that?

00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:10.710
What is that?

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:13.030
And she's like, it's the sun.

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:18.190
And I remember her walking me
through how the sun came up

00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:21.140
to the sky.

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:29.260
And so from the minute that
I could remember myself,

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:34.100
Mukamana was taking everything,
at least in terms of elements,

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:38.300
and teaching me how
they're all part of us,

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:41.870
and how they also have
these different characters.

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:43.010
And so I wake up.

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:44.990
I'm like, how is the sun today?

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:46.370
And how is the moon?

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:48.020
And how are the stars?

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:49.490
And how is the water?

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:50.960
And how is this?

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:54.250
Everything moved,
and everything shook.

00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:58.040
And her stories, Mukamana's
stories had no end.

00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:01.740
Of course, "The Girl Who
Smiled Beads," I ended it.

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:02.970
But I didn't like the end.

00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:04.220
So I keep ending.

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:05.150
I kept adding on.

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:06.680
I kept adding on.

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:13.620
Her stories, they were
not like, a long time ago.

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:17.090
It was just like, just not so
far from here, there was this,

00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:18.990
and there's that,
and that, and that.

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:21.360
And what do you
think happened next?

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:24.890
And so storytelling
to me has always

00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:29.120
been a way to be able to add
on and make sense of the world,

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:30.980
or make sense of people.

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:36.260
And if you did not, in
my family, till today,

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:40.940
if you did not know how
to add on to my story

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:47.720
that I had just started, we were
not going to be communicating.

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:50.750
And so now I use
that also as well.

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:54.550
It's like, if we meet each
other, and I said hello to you,

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:56.980
and I say, how are you?

00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:59.260
Or are you working on something?

00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:01.600
You're telling your own story.

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:04.270
If you are not
willing to add onto me

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:06.890
and you are not willing
for me to add onto you,

00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:09.950
we're not going to be friends.

00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:16.920
It's just not going to happen,
because then who am I to you?

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:19.280
And who am I to me?

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:22.400
And so I believe the
art of storytelling

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:25.130
is in our everyday relationship.

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:28.200
It's our connection
point as a human.

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:28.920
I forgot.

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:36.280
It's Chinua Achebe
that said that, humans

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:42.404
are the only creatures that
are connected through stories.

00:29:42.404 --> 00:29:43.570
There's something like that.

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:46.120
I'll put it on
Instagram later on.

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.570
You can find it the right way.

00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:49.270
But when I heard
that, it was like,

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:52.270
humans are the ones who can
pass on through stories.

00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:54.430
I mean, from like
Greek mythology

00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:57.790
to even different
parts of Africa.

00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:02.260
We have our own mythology
on how the world became.

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:05.590
And those stories are
about to come forward.

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:06.670
You know why?

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:11.140
Because through many African,
and also many indigenous

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:14.080
stories, the world doesn't end.

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.120
The world continues.

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:19.180
And at least from
different parts of Africa,

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:21.730
the stories are coming
from a place of abundance.

00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:26.290
It's a full circle, and
honoring every heart beat.

00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:30.210
And so I'm excited for that.

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:32.820
I'm excited for
stories to connect us.

00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:34.690
I'm excited for
story to connect us

00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:40.260
as women, as a connection point
to be able to be creators,

00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:42.930
to create babies, and
babies can be books,

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:45.030
and babies can be art pieces.

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:48.390
Babies could be normal
humans walking around.

00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:50.219
And I'm excited
for men and women

00:30:50.219 --> 00:30:52.010
to be able to come
together, because that's

00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:54.720
the join of creation.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:57.630
That's the point
that I'm excited

00:30:57.630 --> 00:31:00.720
for our generation,
generation to come,

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:03.630
for us to add onto each
other, and to connect

00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:05.075
from a place of abundance.

00:31:05.075 --> 00:31:06.450
KELLY REILLY: And
you're building

00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:08.040
a platform for that to happen.

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:09.480
You're always connecting people.

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:11.020
I've heard you call
yourself a Dot Connector.

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:12.103
CLEMANTINE WAMARIYA: Yeah.

00:31:12.103 --> 00:31:13.920
KELLY REILLY: I
love that phrase.

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:16.980
And building connections goes
beyond just the book, right?

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:18.930
You've traveled the
world as an advocate.

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:20.617
You've done TED Talks.

00:31:20.617 --> 00:31:22.200
What can you share
with us that you've

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:24.158
learned about building
connections between very

00:31:24.158 --> 00:31:26.340
diverse sets of people?

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:29.910
CLEMANTINE WAMARIYA: Well,
I would say that all of us

00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:31.440
are connectors.

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:33.990
All of us are dot
connectors, whichever part.

00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:36.270
And when I mean dot
connector, I actually

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:38.580
mean like a heart
beat connecting

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:39.990
to another heartbeat.

00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:40.800
KELLY REILLY: Oh,
that's beautiful.

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:42.758
CLEMANTINE WAMARIYA:
Yeah, because we all are--

00:31:42.758 --> 00:31:46.020
we're all the minute that
your heart is beating.

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:50.010
The first thing that they check
with the baby is your heart.

00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:53.250
And in anything,
any breathing thing.

00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:55.140
And so being able
to connect to that.

00:31:55.140 --> 00:32:03.640
But also like a recent example,
my friend Owen is over there.

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:08.970
Owen and I met maybe three years
ago as one of my connections

00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:11.340
three years ago in London.

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:14.097
And I was walking with
one of my friends,

00:32:14.097 --> 00:32:16.305
who was like, oh, I'm going
to take you to this shop.

00:32:16.305 --> 00:32:17.570
It was like chocolate.

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:19.290
It was Dark Sugar.

00:32:19.290 --> 00:32:21.780
If you're ever in
London, Dark Sugar.

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:24.480
And then I just hear
a tap, and a tap.

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:25.560
And I just turn around.

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:27.540
And he's like, open your mouth.

00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:30.800
I'm like, open my what?

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:33.090
You're just a strange man
in the road just telling

00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:34.529
me to open my mouth.

00:32:34.529 --> 00:32:35.820
And he's like, open your mouth.

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:37.890
And I'm like, no!

00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:40.000
And then he's like,
oh, my goodness,

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.484
why don't you trust me?

00:32:41.484 --> 00:32:42.900
I just want to
feed you chocolate.

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:45.690
And he had chocolate
in his hand.

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:46.940
KELLY REILLY: That's so sweet.

00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:51.840
CLEMANTINE WAMARIYA:
And so I was just

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:52.950
like, oh, my goodness, OK.

00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:53.640
I'll take the chocolate.

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.015
And I went to the
chocolate shop.

00:32:55.015 --> 00:32:57.150
It was just right
at a chocolate shop.

00:32:57.150 --> 00:33:00.230
And I went in.

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:01.980
And then we talked.

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:03.640
We kind of like played around.

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:04.950
There was music playing.

00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:06.070
And then I walked away.

00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:09.520
And then two years
later, I see someone.

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:12.660
I'm in this Nomadic
Garden, the Nomadic

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:15.960
Garden in Shoreditch in London.

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:20.880
And we're all gathered.

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:24.300
It was like all these different
beautiful people from like--

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:26.310
one of our friends
was from the Bronx.

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:28.380
The other people
were from Ireland.

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:30.210
Some people were
from who knows where.

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:32.820
It was just a bunch of
African, African diaspora, all

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:34.540
of us hanging out at
this Nomadic Garden,

00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:37.770
and like Middle
Eastern, Russians.

00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:39.120
We're all just hanging out.

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:42.127
And the next thing you
know, I see this person.

00:33:42.127 --> 00:33:43.710
And I'm like, I've
seen him somewhere.

00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:45.000
And I couldn't connect.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.200
And he was like, guys,
we're going, going, going.

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:50.040
And actually, my friend
Nima in just walked also.

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:52.560
So she was-- I had lost her,
and I couldn't find her.

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:56.070
The next thing you
know, it's like 15 of us

00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:58.260
just like following this--

00:33:58.260 --> 00:33:59.190
following Owen.

00:33:59.190 --> 00:34:01.257
And Owen was just dragging us.

00:34:01.257 --> 00:34:02.590
Oh, we're going to get burritos.

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:04.187
We're going to get some food.

00:34:04.187 --> 00:34:06.270
And then after that, I
wanted to go get chocolate.

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:07.811
And then when we
got there, they were

00:34:07.811 --> 00:34:10.400
like, you guys help us move this
thing for the event tonight.

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.360
So we're all helping
moving things.

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:15.030
And the next thing you know,
he's leading us into the bus.

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:19.389
And we were together until
like 3:00 AM, like 20 people

00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:22.050
all from the Nomadic Garden.

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:23.550
None of us had ever met.

00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:26.639
And when we met, we
were all like just

00:34:26.639 --> 00:34:29.080
taking care of each other.

00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:33.210
It was this connection
that I am just getting

00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:34.650
goosebumps thinking about it.

00:34:34.650 --> 00:34:37.110
I mean, that night we
went to hear some jazz.

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:39.420
And this jazz, it was
almost like it just

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:42.810
flew from New Orleans
to having this top jazz.

00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:45.840
And we heard this music,
it was like Afro-punk,

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:50.340
like from this Nigerian artist.

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:51.030
Name again?

00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:52.121
AUDIENCE: DemiGosh.

00:34:52.121 --> 00:34:53.370
CLEMANTINE WAMARIYA: DemiGosh.

00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:55.969
DemiGosh is Irish-Nigerian.

00:34:55.969 --> 00:34:59.017
And he's singing like this
really intense hard rock,

00:34:59.017 --> 00:35:00.600
but he's singing
like, oh, I love you.

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:01.660
Come back to me.

00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:04.930
But it's like hard
rock, like metal.

00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:06.650
And it's just so beautiful.

00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:10.890
There was a point
where I just couldn't.

00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:13.830
I was in so much joy
looking at this community,

00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:18.100
mostly queer, mostly
African, and mostly European.

00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:21.870
All of us in this like
basement together just dancing.

00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:28.860
I fell on the floor in tears
and in a joy that nothing,

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:34.620
not even invisible lines that we
call borders could ever divide

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:37.830
our hearts and our breath.

00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:41.820
And that's the true connection
that I'm talking about,

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:48.000
that I make just going on some
random tour that I've made up.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.190
But now I have a book.

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:50.690
I don't have to say
that I'm random.

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:52.356
I could actually be
like, I have a book.

00:35:52.356 --> 00:35:53.400
Will you let me in?

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:55.020
I'm just here to
connect that heart.

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:58.590
So as you see, these are
actually the symbols.

00:35:58.590 --> 00:36:02.910
It's all into very like
the mythology of Rwanda

00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:06.660
storytelling, where the colors
of white and black and red,

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:09.210
symbolizing all a
part of our human.

00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:13.920
And so-- and also, I want to
say, as you read the book--

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:15.825
well, the book has--

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:21.170
this is Claire's Odyssey.

00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:23.340
Claire's crazy journey.

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:24.570
She was like, let's just go.

00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:27.270
Let's go explore Africa.

00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:29.190
That's the story
that I told myself,

00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:34.740
but actually it was more
of wars and nonsense.

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:38.640
And so this is Claire's Odyssey.

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:41.160
And I cannot wait for her
to tell her story forward.

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:45.540
And then of course in every
chapter you have a timeline.

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:48.720
And the timeline
is our timeline,

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:50.800
but it is also your timeline.

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:53.340
And so when you get to chapter
3 or 4 and you're like,

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:59.130
I can't do it anymore, just take
your notepad, and just pause,

00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:00.540
and think about 2004.

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:02.040
Maybe 2004 was awesome.

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:03.000
Maybe it wasn't.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.360
Just get in there, and
just remember 2004.

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:08.030
Remember you
remember the people.

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:10.680
And so that's also still
connecting the dots.

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:12.720
The dots connecting
not only your timeline,

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:15.454
but your heartbeat and
everyone around you.

00:37:15.454 --> 00:37:16.370
KELLY REILLY: Amazing.

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:17.252
Good.

00:37:17.252 --> 00:37:18.575
That's so nice, right?

00:37:18.575 --> 00:37:19.900
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:22.252
And that connects so
nicely into something else

00:37:22.252 --> 00:37:23.710
I wanted to ask
you about, which is

00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:25.880
that I understand that
this story was originally

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:27.230
pitched as a fairy tale.

00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:27.690
CLEMANTINE WAMARIYA: Yeah.

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:29.330
KELLY REILLY: It could not be
more different from the story

00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:32.040
that was written, but
thematically really similar.

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:33.920
So can you tell us
about that impulse

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:35.150
to make this a fairy tale?

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:36.191
CLEMANTINE WAMARIYA: Yes.

00:37:36.191 --> 00:37:40.010
So right after I came
back from Rwanda in 2004

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:45.320
and graduating
from college, I was

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:48.920
so hungry to connect to
the child in all of us,

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:52.040
because when I went back to
Rwanda, that's the one that I

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:54.090
felt was filled the most.

00:37:54.090 --> 00:37:59.310
And it was not tinted
by any ideology.

00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:01.930
And so just remembering
like little Clemantine

00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:02.930
just going to everybody.

00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:03.740
I was like, what's your name?

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:04.300
What are you?

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:04.850
Who are you?

00:38:04.850 --> 00:38:08.686
What you could-- I just wanted
to remember like the four-

00:38:08.686 --> 00:38:12.560
or five-, six-year-old
Clemantine before the world

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:17.900
showed me the
other side of life.

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:23.200
I wanted to write about
the girl who smiled beads,

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:24.610
and how the girl
who smiled beads

00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:29.860
reminded me of me beyond labels.

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:34.720
And I had the
manuscript written down

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:41.980
actually from like 2013
when I went to South Africa

00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:44.050
to the Oprah Winfrey School.

00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:46.090
And I saw this doll.

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:48.370
It was beaded from head to toe.

00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:53.260
And all these beautiful beads,
these beautiful African beads.

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:55.660
Actually, also Indian beads.

00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:59.350
And I saw it.

00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:01.330
And I was just like,
oh, my goodness.

00:39:01.330 --> 00:39:02.240
I remember it.

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:03.190
I remember it.

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:04.640
It's the girl who smiled beads.

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:05.510
That's the story.

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:06.430
That's the fairy tale.

00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:09.940
That's my backstory.

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:11.230
That's my background story.

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:13.360
That's the story that
I've always lived.

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:15.110
That's why I have
all these buttons.

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:16.630
That's why I have
all these beads.

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:21.380
I had a bucket of beads like
under my bed in college.

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:24.730
And so I started illustrating
this whole scene of the--

00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:29.830
it was 12 scenes of
the girl smiling beads.

00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:34.180
And the girl who smiled
beads is of this woman

00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:39.540
who had everything you
could possibly dream of.

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:41.740
But there was one thing
that she did not have,

00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:43.900
she did not have a life.

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:47.830
And one day she cried
louder than a thunder.

00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:51.880
And her tears flooded
the whole city.

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:56.110
And the thunder and the rain had
to stop and come down and ask

00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:58.580
her, why are you crying?

00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:02.260
You have everything you
could possibly ever dream of.

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:04.030
And she said, yes, I do.

00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:08.120
But I don't have a life.

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:10.550
And so the thunder and
the rain walked away.

00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:12.620
And then they came
back, and said,

00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:19.520
well, we are going
to give you life,

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:23.880
but this life is going to
come with a lot of surprises.

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:29.480
And so a few months later, she
felt a life in her stomach.

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:31.840
And the next thing you know
she had this beautiful baby

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:36.840
that grew up to be
this beautiful girl.

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:40.480
But when the girl started
smiling, she noticed something.

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:43.820
There were all these
different gems everywhere.

00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:46.205
Every day, every day,
every day, the whole house

00:40:46.205 --> 00:40:48.290
was filled with gems.

00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:51.380
And so the mother
started building a wall

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:53.690
to be able to protect
her, but also to be

00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:58.040
able to not tell her neighbors
like, yes, I have this child.

00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:01.520
And this child, when she smiles,
gems just appear everywhere.

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:04.210
But the girl was able to--

00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:06.830
and also of course,
it sounds really crazy

00:41:06.830 --> 00:41:09.260
right now that I'm telling
the story like this.

00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:11.960
I was five and six when
I made this story up.

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:13.319
So bear with me.

00:41:13.319 --> 00:41:15.110
One day it's going to
be a children's book.

00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:17.750
So you will have more
characters into it.

00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:21.150
And so that's the
story that I pitched.

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:24.480
But the girl goes from
one place to another.

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:26.822
And when she gets there,
people look at her.

00:41:26.822 --> 00:41:28.280
And they look at
her, and they say,

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:30.790
we've never seen you before.

00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:31.520
What's your name?

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:32.090
Who are you?

00:41:32.090 --> 00:41:35.120
And before she could say
her name, she smiles.

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:37.340
Just beads appear everywhere.

00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:38.510
And people collect.

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:39.710
And they didn't see her.

00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:42.230
So in Rwanda, there's
a lot of hills.

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:44.720
So she goes from
one hill to another.

00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:46.940
And her mother could
follow the trails

00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:49.830
of beads she left behind.

00:41:49.830 --> 00:41:52.850
And so I pitched
this story to be

00:41:52.850 --> 00:41:54.830
able to talk about
how this story helped

00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:58.070
me remember me beyond labels.

00:41:58.070 --> 00:42:01.910
And I pitched it with like
a bunch of other newspapers.

00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:03.980
And they were not so into it.

00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:07.120
And then my agent, who was
able to say, you know what?

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:10.400
We would like the back
backstory before "The Girl

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:11.480
Who Smiled Beads."

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:15.260
And the story now
you have is this.

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:18.800
But it's about the story of
war and what comes after.

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:23.090
I'm excited of what comes after
now, because everybody gets

00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:25.490
to add on to what the girl
who smiles beads does,

00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:27.800
whatever you want her to be.

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:29.900
So that's the character
that I'm really

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:33.230
excited to evolve and to
bring into your homes.

00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:35.030
And you can add on.

00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:37.640
Your little nieces and
nephews could add on.

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:39.710
If you have children,
they could add on.

00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:42.680
I actually want children
to add on more than adults.

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:43.994
But adults can add on as well.

00:42:43.994 --> 00:42:44.910
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:45.460
CLEMANTINE WAMARIYA: Yeah.

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:46.262
KELLY REILLY: Yeah.

00:42:46.262 --> 00:42:47.345
CLEMANTINE WAMARIYA: Yeah.

00:42:47.345 --> 00:42:49.053
KELLY REILLY: We have
a few minutes left.

00:42:49.053 --> 00:42:51.290
I want to either invite
you to do a reading,

00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:53.090
or I can jump into
the next questions.

00:42:53.090 --> 00:42:54.630
What would you prefer?

00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:58.330
CLEMANTINE WAMARIYA: Well, since
we have a little bit of time,

00:42:58.330 --> 00:43:02.130
not a lot of time, I am
going to read an excerpt.

00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:03.380
Maybe we'll have a little bit.

00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:09.230
It's [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:11.060
This is when I knew
that was the spot.

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:13.610
When I got here, I was like,
oh, this is where it's at.

00:43:13.610 --> 00:43:17.870
So this is chapter 14.

00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:21.380
And to give you a little bit
of background in chapter 14,

00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:25.190
this is how my mother
used to test us.

00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:27.080
She would say, go get an orange.

00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:29.870
And we'd bring in an orange.

00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:31.790
And she would cut
out all the pieces,

00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:33.470
and share with everybody.

00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:37.580
And if you were
new at our house,

00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:40.850
my mother would know if
you were a sharer or not.

00:43:40.850 --> 00:43:43.750
If you didn't know how
to share, my mother then

00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:46.340
would literally invite
you to the family,

00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:48.220
and you would
learn how to share.

00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:51.260
And you're going to live
learning how to share.

00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:54.620
But it was her secret.

00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:57.810
I find myself sometimes doing
that to people, especially

00:43:57.810 --> 00:43:58.310
with food.

00:43:58.310 --> 00:43:59.560
And some people don't like it.

00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:08.740
I think back to
this often in trying

00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:13.210
to make sense of the world;
how there are people who

00:44:13.210 --> 00:44:17.110
have so much and people
who have so little,

00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:22.220
and how I fit in with them both.

00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:27.470
Often I find myself trying to
bridge the two worlds to show

00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:30.950
people either the
people who have so much

00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:36.600
or the people with so little
that everything's yours,

00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:40.160
and everything is not yours.

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:45.620
I wish to invite
you to understand

00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:52.470
that boxing ourselves into tiny
cubbies based on class, race,

00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:57.470
ethnicity, religion,
anything really,

00:44:57.470 --> 00:45:03.550
comes from a poverty of mind,
a poverty of imagination.

00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:08.110
The world is dull and cruel
when we isolate ourselves.

00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:17.120
Survival, the true survival
of the body and the soul,

00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:22.550
and now I've added on in spirit,
requires creativity, freedom

00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:26.270
of thoughts, and collaboration.

00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:29.810
You might have time,
and I might have land.

00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:33.650
You might have an idea,
and I might have strength.

00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:38.270
You might have a tomato,
and I might have a knife.

00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:40.940
We need each other.

00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:47.390
We need to say, I honor the
things that you respect,

00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:50.305
and I value the things
that you cherish.

00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:55.690
I am not better than you.

00:45:55.690 --> 00:45:57.760
You are not better than me.

00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:02.470
Nobody is better
than anybody else.

00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:07.400
Nobody is who you think
they are at first glance.

00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:12.490
We need to see beyond the
projection, the categories we

00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:16.120
cast into each other.

00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:25.920
Each one of us is so grand,
more nuanced, more extraordinary

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:29.490
than anybody thinks,
including ourselves.

00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:36.010
That's my favorite
passage, because it really

00:46:36.010 --> 00:46:40.780
goes back to one [INAUDIBLE]
over there is reminding us

00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:43.210
about the [INAUDIBLE]
presence, being

00:46:43.210 --> 00:46:46.270
able to be so into
presence, and being

00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:49.000
able to know that
we're all here together

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.910
in this beautiful
place called Earth.

00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:57.640
And I am just so
incredibly honored

00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:04.810
and grateful to be able to
share a piece of my life

00:47:04.810 --> 00:47:09.700
with all of you, as well as
to encourage you for you also

00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:15.370
to share some part of you
that all of us can learn from,

00:47:15.370 --> 00:47:20.740
and to remember that your
story is just another story

00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:23.800
connecting, just like
this beautiful bracelet,

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:26.470
or the necklaces, or
the beads come together.

00:47:29.290 --> 00:47:32.290
And I know that I
sound very optimistic.

00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:39.320
It's a practice, because you
can either be optimistic or not

00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:40.390
be optimistic.

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:42.740
And with optimistic
comes practice.

00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:44.960
And with practice comes work.

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:49.040
And work comes this full
circle of a community

00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:53.180
of people who are willing
and hoping for all of us

00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:55.010
to be together here.

00:47:55.010 --> 00:47:59.400
And if we continue
channeling that ideology,

00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:01.460
and if we continue
investing our time

00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:05.180
and energy and our resources,
and maybe it's possible.

00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:08.870
Because imagine all the
people who imagined us

00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:13.250
here, who wrote
our characters here

00:48:13.250 --> 00:48:16.190
to be in this room
with each other.

00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:21.290
So I hope that we continue and
extend also the imagination

00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:24.830
of us being here together.

00:48:24.830 --> 00:48:25.820
Thank you so much.

00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:29.080
KELLY REILLY: Please join me in
thanking Clemantine Wamariya.
