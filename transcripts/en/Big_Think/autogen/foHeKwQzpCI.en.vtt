adventurous so we've had that
 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.700

American consciousness I think all of

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050
American consciousness I think all of
 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.439
American consciousness I think all of
those are factors combined have made it

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:36.449
those are factors combined have made it
 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:38.569
those are factors combined have made it
possible for us to be in the forefront

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579
possible for us to be in the forefront
 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.439
possible for us to be in the forefront
of change social change as we had to

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449
of change social change as we had to

forth and also changes that have taken
 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.939
forth and also changes that have taken
place in innovative science because

America has had the best university

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750
America has had the best university
 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.020
America has had the best university
system in the world for a long time and

system in the world for a long time and
 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.079
system in the world for a long time and
so we have been innovators not only in

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089
so we have been innovators not only in
 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:02.660

and chemistry and physics and that sort

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320
and chemistry and physics and that sort
 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.650
and chemistry and physics and that sort
of thing but we've been able to put that

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:06.660
of thing but we've been able to put that
 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.680
of thing but we've been able to put that
into practical application with new

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690
into practical application with new
 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.670
into practical application with new
gadgets that people admire

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680
 
 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.070
 
we've had a serious problem in our

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080
we've had a serious problem in our
 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.780
we've had a serious problem in our
country in recent I'd say few decades in

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790
country in recent I'd say few decades in
 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.880

becoming more inclined toward

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890
becoming more inclined toward
 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.190
becoming more inclined toward
consumption and gratification oh how

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200
consumption and gratification oh how
 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.520
consumption and gratification oh how
much we own rather than have a spirit of

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530
much we own rather than have a spirit of
 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.910
much we own rather than have a spirit of
innovation and dynamism and producing

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920
innovation and dynamism and producing
 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.719
innovation and dynamism and producing
new products it was in the 1970s that

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729
new products it was in the 1970s that
 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.670
new products it was in the 1970s that
our nation first became a consumer

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680
our nation first became a consumer
 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.180
our nation first became a consumer
nation that is we bought from foreigners

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190
nation that is we bought from foreigners
 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.260
nation that is we bought from foreigners
more than we sold to foreigners and

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270
more than we sold to foreigners and
 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.330
more than we sold to foreigners and
increasingly that has been a blight on

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340
increasingly that has been a blight on
 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.359
increasingly that has been a blight on
our economic system increasingly every

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369
our economic system increasingly every
 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.330
our economic system increasingly every
year and now we have an enormous trade

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340
year and now we have an enormous trade
 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.430
year and now we have an enormous trade
deficit that is we buy from foreign

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440
deficit that is we buy from foreign
 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.130
deficit that is we buy from foreign
nations particularly China and others a

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140
nations particularly China and others a
 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.520
nations particularly China and others a
lot more than we sell them and it means

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530
lot more than we sell them and it means
 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.080
lot more than we sell them and it means
that they are producing the products

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090
that they are producing the products
 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.840
that they are producing the products
that we use and we used to be the main

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850
that we use and we used to be the main
 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.889
that we use and we used to be the main
producer of our goods to be sold to to

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899
producer of our goods to be sold to to
 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.840
producer of our goods to be sold to to
our competitive nations that were fairly

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850
our competitive nations that were fairly
 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.910
our competitive nations that were fairly
well-off and particularly to the

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920
well-off and particularly to the
 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.890
well-off and particularly to the
countries that were very poor that's

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900
countries that were very poor that's
 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.110
countries that were very poor that's
changed now so I think we've lost the

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120
changed now so I think we've lost the
 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.270
changed now so I think we've lost the
competitive edge that we had a number of

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280
competitive edge that we had a number of
 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.790
competitive edge that we had a number of
years ago
