&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.750
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernstein: Hi, everyone.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.060
I'm Lenny Bernstein.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.850
I'm a Health and Medicine
Reporter for the Washington Post.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:19.400
And I have the honor of introducing
our next author, Dava Sobel,

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.460
author of "The Glass Universe."

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.170 position:56%
Before we get there a couple of
things I'm supposed to tell you all.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.540
Obviously you're spending
the day here in the cool

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.380
and dry convention center,
instead of out on the mall.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.160
And we're very happy about that.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.730
The Library of Congress
puts this all together.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.370
They make it seem easy every year,
get people in and out of here.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.670
And you get to see a lot
of your favorite authors.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.720
It's a very large financial
undertaking.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.140
And it's only made possible by the
generous support of our sponsors.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.080
This presentation is sponsored
by the James Madison Council.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.010
We can't take for granted that
this event will continue to exist.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.300 position:56%
So we'd like to ask you to consider
making a contribution now using your

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.600
cell phone.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.910
You can do it right now before
you leave this presentation.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.810
You can send a text to
make a one-time gift.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.540
And the details are on the screen
and on the back of your program.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.280
A couple of things, sort of house,

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.140
some details about
what will happen next.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.000
Miss Sobel will have a
signing time from 3:00 p.m.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.860
to 4:00 p.m. of her new book.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.450
And she's in Line 5.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.950
So if you want to go get your book
signed, please do that after this.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.510
Dava Sobel has been writing
about science as a freelancer,

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.640
a New York Times reporter
and an author since 1970.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.930
She's best known for her
1995 bestseller "Longitude:

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.220
The True Story of a Lone Genius

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.940
Who Solved the Greatest
Scientific Problem of His Time."

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.120
Her book "Galileo's
Daughter" was a finalist

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.970
for the Pulitzer Prize
in Biography in 2000.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:15.060
Much cooler she has seen nine total
eclipses now, counting this one.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.730
She's an eclipse chaser.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.500
And even cooler than
that the asteroid

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:27.510
"30935 Davasobel" is
named after her.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.300
[ Applause ]

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.190 position:56%
During the Q&amp;A that comes at the end
of the presentation you might want

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.910
to ask how you get an
asteroid named after yourself.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.730
Her latest book is called "The
Glass Universe: How the Ladies

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.750
of the Harvard Observatory
Took the Measure of the Stars."

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.450 position:56%
And it reveals the extraordinary
discoveries made by a group of women

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.190
who analyzed and interpreted
the observations made

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.120
by male astronomers via telescope.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.510
So please welcome Dava Sobel.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:10.090
[ Applause ]

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.390
&gt;&gt; Dava Sobel: Thank you.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.740
It really is a thrill to be here.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.880
I was a little mystified by the
title of these sessions though.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.190
"Contemporary Life."

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:27.320
I'm wondering if it's a
euphemism for science.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.420
Maybe. Maybe.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.570
I also want to reiterate
the title of the book,

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.400
which you see on the slide.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.700
There it is.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.150
It's "The Glass Universe."

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.740
It wasn't an intentional play
on the term "glass ceiling."

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.050
But I find that it often gets
called "The Glass Ceiling."

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.340
And it's really not about that.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:57.420
It is really about a collection
of photographs of the sky

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.620
that were taken on glass plates.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.090
This is 19th-century technology

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.490
when photography was
brought into astronomy.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:16.960
And the medium for taking pictures
was an emulsion-coated glass plate.

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:23.400
And these half-a-million plates
are still kept at Harvard.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.910
They're still used.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.190
In fact, they were in
the news this week.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.880
I don't know how many of you
saw an article about a discovery

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.870
that was made in the
late 15th century

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:43.110
by some Korean astrologers
who saw a guest star.

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:50.650
And recently some historian
astronomers really wanted to figure

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:56.380
out whether that had
been a nova, a supernova.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:02.520
And they thought they would look
at the Harvard glass plates,

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.160
and try to figure out if they
could see that object again.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.460
And they did it.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.920
They found it on several
of the plates.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.010
So that's my bow to
contemporary life.

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:16.380
[ Laughter ]

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.940
But now to return to
the late 19th century.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:26.090
I first heard about these
women more than 20 years ago.

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.960
And I was fascinated to think
that there was a whole roomful

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.930 position:56%
of women doing astronomy at Harvard,

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.940
which is certainly not
a place people associate

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.430
with wide open opportunities
for women,

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.250
especially in the 19th century.

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.410
So I thought that was
definitely a story.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.600
And I was even more excited

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.470
when I saw how many pictures
there were of the women.

00:05:54.470 --> 00:06:01.730 position:56%
So I will try to show you as many of
those as I can in the time we have.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:06.300
And part of the reason there were

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:12.080 position:56%
so many women was the broad-minded
attitude of the very young director,

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:19.780
Edward Pickering, who took over in
1877 when he was just 30 years old.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.930
And he had been teaching at MIT.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.480
And he was really a physicist.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.130
And, so, people were worried what
sort of job he would do as head

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:32.410
of the observatory, because
he wasn't that interested

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:36.280
in doing what established
observatories did,

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:41.150
which was really study
the mapping of the sky,

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:47.740
the orbits of the planets and
asteroids, comets, and be largely

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.540
in the service of navigation.

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.310
But he was interested in
the physics of the stars.

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:56.340
And he started doing things

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:02.330
that other observatories were not
doing, including hiring women.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.130
And there was a strong prejudice

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:09.140
against higher education
for women at this time.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.220
Although Pickering
had been very open

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:16.650
about letting interested women
students come to his course at MIT.

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:23.790
And this book "Sex in Education, a
Fair Chance for the Girls" sounds

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:27.350
like something that
was good for women.

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:34.250
But actually the argument was that
going to college was dangerous

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:41.000
for women in the college-age
years, because devoting all

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.200
that mental energy to schoolwork
would cause their reproductive

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.210
organs to atrophy.

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:50.400
[ Laughter ]

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:57.360
And Pickering was also
able to laugh at that.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.580
Thank goodness.

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:03.730
And felt that women had already
demonstrated their ability

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:05.030
to do astronomy.

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:08.610
When he arrived at
Harvard the daughter of one

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:12.780
of the former directors was working
there, the sister of another one.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:16.620
So there were about six
women already employed

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.680
at the observatory as computers.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:25.220
And he saw no reason
not to keep that going.

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:27.310
This is what the observatory
looked like.

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:31.080
It was a very attractive
wooden building on a hill

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.630
about a mile from Harvard Yard.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:35.270
There were two telescopes.

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:40.390
And then the building that has
the three smokestacks was the

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:41.960
director's residence.

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.260
So he was right there.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.950
He could just roll in and
out of bed and be at work.

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:51.150
This was the big telescope
under the big dome.

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:52.450
It is still there.

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:53.830
It's no longer used.

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:55.790
Can't do much astronomy
from Cambridge.

00:08:55.790 --> 00:09:02.290
Sometimes when it was in good
repair, and it will be again,

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:06.270
it's used for public nights to
have people come, and get a look

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.770
at the planets, and get
turned on to astronomy.

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:12.690
And this telescope was a
gift to the observatory

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:15.500
from the people of Boston.

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:19.150
So here's one of these glass
plates that I'm talking about.

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:26.920
Some of them were photographs of
unusual phenomena such as a comet.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.980
Most of them are negatives.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:33.970
So the stars look black
against a white background,

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:37.470
stars or other objects.

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:44.690
And the most interesting
use of the plates, I think,

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:50.110
was started by this couple since
it was actually an astronomy love

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:56.760
story, because the man, Dr. Henry
Draper, was an amateur astronomy.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.970
Do we have any amateur
astronomers here?

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:02.470
Just a few.

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:06.290
Ooh, we need to get
proselytizing here in Washington.

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:12.180
And the amateurs were the ones
who could be at the forefront,

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:16.170
especially if they were
married to someone as wealthy

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:21.310
as an Anna Palmer Draper,
who was an heiress.

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:24.040
And she and her husband
worked together.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.720
They took images together.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:31.000
And he was the first person to
succeed in taking a photograph

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.290
of the spectrum of a star.

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:37.590
So the stars' light run
through a prism and spread

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:41.570
out into its component wavelengths.

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:44.440
And this was so important.

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.510
They were going to drop everything.

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:49.100
He was going to stop teaching.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:52.330
He was a medical doctor,
but he taught.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:57.620
And devote the rest of
their lives to this project

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:01.140
to photograph the spectra
of the stars,

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:05.570
and figure out why the
stars were different colors,

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:08.080
maybe how they worked,
what they were made of,

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.710
what were the chemical
components of the stars.

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:15.140
As recently as the 1840s,

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:18.950
1850s people had assumed
they would never find

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:22.930
out what the stars were made of,
because they were too far away.

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:25.830
So there was just no hope of that.

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:30.930
And now all of a sudden with
spectroscopy it was possible.

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:36.020
And Henry Draper said that the
spectroscope had made the chemists'

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:39.880
arms millions of miles long.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.140
So they were all set to do this

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:48.510
when he suddenly contracted
pneumonia and died at age 45.

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:52.610
And she was determined to
see his dream realized.

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:55.970 position:56%
And she was a friend of Pickering's.

00:11:55.970 --> 00:12:01.600
Everybody doing astronomy was
more or less friendly then.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.440
It's still a relatively
small community as you saw.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:09.970
And she offered Pickering
her personal fortune

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:14.560
if he would do the work
in her husband's name.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:20.580
And that's what gave him the
means to hire so many women.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:27.490
So here is a textbook example
of a spectrum, of course,

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:31.060
long before color photography
in the 1880s.

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:33.660
This was what some of the
best of the images looked

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:35.930
like for the very brightest stars.

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:39.740
And most of the time the
pictures looked like this,

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:46.010
because Pickering figured out that
if he put the prism at the far end

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:48.400
of the telescope, instead
of the eyepiece,

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.800
he could capture hundreds
on every plate.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.730
And then it would just be a
question of examining the plate

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:57.600
with a magnifying glass
or a microscope.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.100
And you could have all
those spectra together.

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:03.710
So every little smudge

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:07.820
in this illustration is
the spectrum of a star.

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:13.590
And the black circle is
a penny, just for size.

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:15.540
So here are the ladies.

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.860
There's Pickering standing
in the back.

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:21.910
And this is obviously
a staged photograph.

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:24.890
But this is pretty
much what they did.

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:28.690
In the foreground is a woman
with a magnifying glass.

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:30.820
And she's looking at
an angled stand.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:34.470
And that's how they held the
plates, which most of them were

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:36.860
about eight by ten inches.

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:39.890
And there was a mirror
under the stand.

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:41.670
And if the shades were
up in the room,

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:45.230
then the sunlight would come
in, bounce off the mirror,

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:46.710
and up through the plate.

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:49.000
So the plate would be illuminated.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.900
And then she would be
looking at the spectrum,

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:59.140
and deciding what classification
it was, and calling that out

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:02.250
to a partner who would
be writing the notes.

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:04.010
You didn't want to be
looking at the plate,

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:06.620
and then turning to
write in a notebook.

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:10.040
So they had a very
well-organized system.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:13.430
And their classification
system started

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:16.360
out just being letters
of the alphabet.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:22.400
They would look at these patterns,
and arbitrarily decide, okay,

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.690
this pattern is a,
this pattern is b.

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:29.500 position:56%
So at the beginning they had no idea
of really what the patterns meant.

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:31.570
Could have been any
number of things.

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:34.240
Different temperatures,
different ages of the stars.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.990
It was an open question.

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:43.560
So this lady, who was standing over
the group in the previous shot,

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:49.440
became the supervisor, which
is remarkable considering

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:54.590
that she started at the observatory
working as a domestic servant.

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:57.220
She came on the resident side,

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.410
because she was in
desperate straits.

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:02.450
She was a Scottish immigrant,

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:05.140
had come to this country
with her husband.

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:07.200
But now he was gone.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:11.600
And she was pregnant and
desperately needed a job.

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:15.590
And, so, she took this position as
the second maid in the household.

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:20.390
And the Pickerings immediately
recognized her intelligence,

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:23.460
and moved her into the
observatory, taught her how

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:29.340
to do computing and
analyzing plates.

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:34.610
And then they helped her go home
to Scotland to deliver her baby

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:37.370
with her mother and grandmother.

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:43.080
And they promised her a real job if
she would come back, which she did.

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:47.510
And she came back and
became the first woman

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:53.400 position:56%
to get a Harvard University title as
Curator of Astronomical Photographs.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:57.430
And she spent the rest of
her life working there.

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:58.730
Here's another one.

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:02.300
Antonia Maury was the
niece of Henry Draper.

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:06.290
And she was also a
graduate of Vassar College,

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:10.580
where she had eight
semesters of astronomy

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:14.010
under this formidable looking
lady with the telescope,

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:20.370
who was Maria Mitchell, the truly
first lady of American astronomy.

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:23.280
Here's another one.

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:26.340
Annie Jump Cannon.

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:32.290 position:56%
The original women were hired to do
computing and to analyze the plates.

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:37.050
But Miss Cannon, who was a
graduate of Wellesley College,

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:41.040
came with so much experience
as a telescope observer

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:45.340
that she did her own
observations from the beginning.

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:49.860
And this drawing of her at the
telescope is from a children's book

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:53.380
about her called "Annie
Jump Cannon, Astronomer."

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:58.420
So here is a typical plate.

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:05.120
Miss Cannon became the one to
perfect the classification system.

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:10.540 position:56%
And on the way to doing that she had
to juggle the alphabet a little bit

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:15.110
so that the system,
that is now in use,

00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:21.280
the way the letters are arranged
is no longer a, b, c, d, etcetera,

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:29.780 position:56%
but it's o, b, a, f, g, k, m. And if
you're wondering how I can remember

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:36.010
that it's with the mnemonic,
"Oh, be a fine girl kiss me."

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:37.380
[ Laughter ]

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:42.590
Which is how astronomy students
for decades have memorized,

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:43.890
they still memorize it that way.

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:47.960
Although now some of them say,
"Oh, be a fine guy kiss me."

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.530
Take your pick.

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:56.000
So she had a marvelous
ability to look at a spectrum,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.490
and instantly understand
what that star was.

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:04.300
So she would [inaudible] there are
numbers written all over the plate.

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:05.600
That's how she worked.

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.850
She would put numbers
next to the spectra.

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:11.850
And then she could call
out a number and a letter,

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:16.930
and the people writing them down
just tried to keep up with her.

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:19.350
Obviously it's not for everyone.

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:21.690
[ Laughter ]

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:25.470
One of the great helps to
me in writing the book,

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:29.900
trying to really bring out the
personalities of these people,

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:33.010
Miss Cannon was a lifelong diarist.

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:37.900
And I got to work in the
Harvard University Archives.

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:42.040
These are the boxes labeled
"Miss Cannon's Diaries."

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:45.620
And it was thrilling
the day I opened that.

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:48.660
I also spent some time here
at the Library of Congress,

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:53.220
because a lot of the Draper
family papers are here.

00:18:53.220 --> 00:19:01.430
And I did find in those folders
the guest list for the dinner party

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:06.130
that the Drapers held when the
National Academy of Sciences met

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:15.200 position:56%
in New York City in 1882 proving
that Thomas Edison really was there.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.140
Pickering wanted to
photograph the whole sky.

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:22.050
He had a tremendous vision of how
valuable a resource this would be

00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:24.930
if he could photograph
both the stars visible

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:27.940
from the Northern Hemisphere and
from the Southern Hemisphere.

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:32.110
And he had a wonderful
assistant, Solon Bailey,

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:35.160
also Bailey's wife,
Ruth Poulter Bailey.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:40.430
And he sent them to South America
to find a place that would be good

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:42.660 position:56%
for carrying on the work down there.

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:47.110
This was their first
set up on Mount Harvard.

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:49.800
Didn't look too promising.

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:56.160
Eventually they really got it
together in the [inaudible]

00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:00.540
of a thought to be extinct volcano.

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:02.710
Turned out to be dormant.

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:05.650
But they were there for many years.

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:10.940
And several of those
buildings house telescopes.

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:13.940
Although only one of
them is dome shaped.

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:17.290
You can have an observatory
with a slide-off roof

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:19.600
as well, as many of those are.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:23.830
But inside the dome is
this gigantic instrument.

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:27.050
This has a lens 24
inches in diameter.

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:30.970
And it was made specifically for
taking these kinds of images.

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:38.010
And this was the gift from another
heiress, Catherine Wolfe Bruce,

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:42.530
who read about Pickering's wish
to create a big telescope to use

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:43.960
in the Southern Hemisphere.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:48.030
And she just wrote him
a check for $50,000.

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:50.510
He was very charming.

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:53.790
[ Laughter ]

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:57.240
Here it wasn't all work in Peru.

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.200
Sometimes they had picnics.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:05.840
Ruth Bailey is the one without
a hat in the foreground.

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:13.100
And then her husband is two
people away from her in the hat.

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:15.340
And they were down there for years.

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.890
They brought their child with them,

00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:23.060
because they knew they were
going to be there for years.

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:25.650
Mostly they studied these objects,

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:27.610
which are called "globular
clusters."

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:31.370 position:56%
Astronomers are very straightforward
about the way they name things.

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:34.030
You know, Big Bang, black hole.

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:39.150 position:56%
This is a globular cluster of stars.

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:43.590 position:56%
And there were a lot of them visible
from the Southern Hemisphere.

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:47.630
And a lot of them that had a
lot of variable stars in them,

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:50.050
stars that changed
their light over time,

00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:54.540
which were of particular interest
to Pickering and the whole group.

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:56.430
And one of the things
they tried to do was

00:21:56.430 --> 00:22:01.310
to count how many stars
were in this object.

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:05.530
A daunting task as
I'm sure you'll agree.

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:11.980
Henrietta Leavitt is
another one who came.

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:14.890
She was deaf.

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:21.620 position:56%
Miss Cannon was also partially deaf,
but Miss Cannon wore a hearing aid,

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:26.110
and was able to go to the
opera and to concerts.

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:32.940
In fact, the Harvard Archives owned
many boxes of all the libretti

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:37.220
and programs she saved because
she was such a music lover.

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:41.640
But Miss Leavitt's job
was to look at the images

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:45.690
from the Southern Hemisphere,
and track the variable stars.

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:49.280
And she made a fascinating
discovery.

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:55.170
She was particularly interested in
this object, which is visible only

00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:56.480
from the Southern Hemisphere.

00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:00.460
It's called the "Small
Magellanic Cloud."

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:04.800
Got its name from Magellan's
round-the-world voyage,

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.190
because he was the first
person to mention them,

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:10.840
and say that they looked
like clouds.

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:13.350
They're actually satellite
galaxies of the Milky Way.

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:16.520
And she figured that
all the stars that were

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:21.120
in that body were roughly the
same distance from the Earth,

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:27.200
so that the stars that looked
brighter actually were brighter.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:32.180 position:56%
Usually when you look up at the sky
you can't tell whether a bright star

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:35.550
is bright because it's
extremely bright intrinsically,

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:39.210
or because it's very close
compared to the others.

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:41.720
But here in this object,

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.780
let's assume they're
all the same distance,

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:49.210
so the bright ones are truly
intrinsically brighter.

00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:51.680
And she tracked that.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:54.480
She published her findings.

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.300
That was the other
thing about Pickering.

00:23:56.300 --> 00:24:01.290
He published everybody's work
under each woman's own name.

00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:03.190
Always gave credit.

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:09.040
They were, all of them, world
famous in their own lifetimes.

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:13.720
So with her observation that
the bright stars were really the

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:20.790
brightest, she also noticed that
of the variable stars the variables

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:24.470
that got the brightest
also took the longest time

00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:26.910
to cycle through their changes.

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:32.970
And that observation
enabled astronomers

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:35.990
to calculate the distance
to this object,

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:40.770
and then the size of the Milky Way.

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:44.130
And that rule, which was
for a long time called the

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:52.290
"Period-Luminosity Relation," it's
now the Leavitt Law, pass it on,

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:59.520
that's what Edwin Hubble used
to show that the little spiral

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:04.590
in the constellation, Andromeda,
was actually another galaxy,

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:09.420
another Milky Way, an
unbelievable distance away.

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:16.710
After Pickering died Harlow Shapley
took over at the observatory.

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:20.350
And he was intent on
initiating a program

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:22.940 position:56%
of graduate education and astronomy.

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:25.140
That was not Pickering's focus.

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:30.990
Pickering's idea had been to
create information and share it

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:34.540
with the world, not
to train astronomers.

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:37.670
And Shapley felt it
was very important

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:40.840
to train the next generation
of astronomers.

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:45.350
And because of all the
interest in the women working

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:52.120
at the observatory several
heiresses had contributed money.

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:55.810
I've mentioned two of
them, Anna Palmer Draper

00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:57.580
and Catherine Wolfe Bruce.

00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:02.650
Another one, Lydia Henchman, who
was a relative of Maria Mitchell,

00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:08.450
began a scholarship program that
enabled a young woman to come work

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:12.800
at Harvard for a year, and
then be able to go on to work

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:16.620
at any other observatory
anywhere in the country.

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:20.140
And they infiltrated
the whole field.

00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:24.320 position:56%
And, you know, I like to say that my
Harvard ladies are the grandmothers

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:29.600
of the hidden figures, because
that's why NASA was so open

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:32.100
to hiring women as computers.

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:36.310
It dates back to these women.

00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:39.880
So these scholarships
came to be known

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:42.250
as the Pickering Fellowship
for Women.

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:47.810
And Shapley thought, okay, I'm
going to have graduate students.

00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:49.860
I have to have graduate
fellowship money.

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:52.820
And the only money he had,

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:58.320 position:56%
because Harvard University did not
support the observatory financially,

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:02.080
so the only money he had were these
Pickering Fellowships for Women.

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:06.500 position:56%
And he thought he could stretch them
to use them for graduate education.

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:08.530
But not stretch them
farther than that.

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:14.750
So the entire first crop of
graduate students were all women.

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:20.010
Well, Shapley was at Mount
Wilson in California,

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:22.820
and he had gotten his
degree at Princeton,

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:24.990
and he came from Missouri.

00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:27.930
So that history was his argument

00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:32.690
of why Harvard needed a
graduate program in education,

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:36.740
because they had been embarrassed
having to hire a Missourian

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:41.260
from California, you know, instead
of promoting one of their own.

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:46.960
But his other interest, when he
wasn't doing astronomy, was ants.

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:51.630
And he published several scientific
papers about ant behavior.

00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:53.900
And I just wish he could have lived

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:55.890
to see this cartoon
in The New Yorker.

00:27:55.890 --> 00:28:00.860
This was not one of those contests
that asks you to supply a caption.

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:04.360
It's just that the caption
got cut off in the slide.

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:09.510
But the caption is, "Kind of
makes you feel small, doesn't it?"

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:14.940
[ Laughter ]

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:17.850
So here are some of
our graduate students

00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:19.970
in astronomy, some
of the early ones.

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:23.600
The large picture is
Margaret Harwood.

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:26.270
She took over at Nantucket.

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:28.940
She ran the Nantucket Observatory

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:31.310
that had been started
by Maria Mitchell.

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:33.240
She ran it for 40 years.

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:38.950
And she got her graduate degree
before these fellowships were

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:42.380
instituted in California.

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:48.480
And the woman in the picture
with the globe is Adelaide Ames,

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:52.640
who came from Vassar on
a Pickering Fellowship.

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:58.150
And at the bottom is Cecilia
Payne, who came from England,

00:28:58.150 --> 00:29:03.060 position:56%
because she had been told in England
that there was no future for her

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:05.000
in astronomy in that country.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.830
And she knew about
the Harvard women.

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:11.120
She knew about Annie
Jump Cannon's work.

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:17.340
And she met Harlow Shapley when he
was in England giving a lecture.

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:21.300
So she told him she really
wanted to come and work there.

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:25.520
And he helped her get
one of those fellowships.

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:29.110
And he pushed her to
be the first one to go

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:32.440
on for a Ph.D., which she did.

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:36.720
And because she had been
in the Cavendish Laboratory

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:40.230
at Cambridge she was the first
person who worked at Harvard

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:42.530 position:56%
who really understood atomic theory.

00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:48.680
And she wanted access to
the glass plates to be able

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:51.770
to calculate the relative abundance

00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:54.920
of the different elements
in the stars.

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:57.160
That had not been done yet.

00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:02.260 position:56%
And as she worked she kept coming up
with a ridiculously high abundance

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:06.470
of hydrogen, which people
considered impossible.

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:08.430
You know, that many
of the same elements

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:10.740
in the Sun are found on the Earth.

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:12.250
And there was a widespread belief

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:14.930
that the proportions
would be similar.

00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:19.750
So the fact that hydrogen was maybe
a million times more prevalent

00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:22.250
than anything else, it
just seemed ridiculous.

00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:27.890
So Shapley sent her dissertation
to the reigning authority,

00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:31.490
who said that it was
impossible for hydrogen

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:34.880
to be a million times
more prevalent.

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:40.800
And, so, in her dissertation
she reported her result.

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:45.870 position:56%
But conceded that it could be an
error, it could be spurious finding.

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:49.800
There could be some explanation
that no one had come up with yet.

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:53.710
It took only four years
from the publication

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:59.370 position:56%
of her doctoral dissertation in 1925
for the entire astronomy community,

00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:02.080
including the person who
had said it was impossible,

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:04.980
who did the research,
to convince everybody

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:07.470
that that was, in fact, the case.

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:11.640
That, yeah, it really
is almost all hydrogen.

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:14.870
This is one of my favorite
pictures of them.

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:20.120 position:56%
Although it does give a sense of
maybe disrespect that they are lined

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:22.490
up like paper dolls,
although there are a couple

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:25.160
of men in the paper doll chain.

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:27.680
But these were some of the pictures

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:30.410
that really inspired
me to tell this story.

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:35.130
And I kept saying over and over
again I couldn't understand why

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:37.180
nobody had done it.

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:41.280
And it turned out that
there's really a lot of science

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:46.300
that goes on, the work that they
did, and what happened in the field

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:48.680
of astronomy over this time period.

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:52.520 position:56%
And I spent many days asking myself,

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:57.750
"Whatever made me think
I could do this?"

00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:59.530
But I hung in.

00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:00.830
Here's Miss Payne.

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:02.650
She was also a musician.

00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:06.020
The previous speaker mentioned
the connection between mathematics

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:07.800
and music, which is strong.

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:11.560
But I think it's even stronger
between astronomy and music.

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:16.670
Almost every astronomer I know
has some kind of musical bent.

00:32:16.670 --> 00:32:21.300
So Miss Payne was an
accomplished singer and violinist.

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:25.600
And she also started in
Observatory Orchestra.

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:28.890
And this was a performance
of a spoof they did called

00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:31.170
"The Observatory Pinafore,"

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:35.070
which used the music of
Gilbert and Sullivan.

00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:40.010
This is how the plates are stored
today, if any of you are wondering.

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:43.650
These are two pictures of the
same young woman, Lindsay Smith,

00:32:43.650 --> 00:32:45.250
who is the current curator.

00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:51.200 position:56%
So starting with Williamina Fleming
the curators have always been women.

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:54.030
And it's a big job.

00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:57.010
And, as I said, there are half
a million of these objects,

00:32:57.010 --> 00:33:02.060
and each one is in a paper
envelope, carefully barcoded.

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:03.420
There's a card catalog.

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:06.090
You have to be able to
get at the one you need.

00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:10.610
And in the picture,
in her gray sweater,

00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:13.910
she's looking at the logbooks
that were kept by the women

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:18.670
as they worked on the images,
and made notes about them.

00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:21.070
This is how the plate
stacks is that,

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:24.760
this building was constructed
expressly to hold the plates.

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:28.580
This was a brick building,
because the wooden observatory,

00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:31.470
the director feared,
was just a fire trap.

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:36.350
And as this collection amassed
everyone, not just at Harvard,

00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:42.040
everyone in the world viewed it
as a unique invaluable resource.

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:45.330
And, so, a brick building
was created for it,

00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:48.870
and definitely fireproof,
but as they found

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:52.210
out a year ago January,
not waterproof.

00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:55.320
A water main burst
underneath the building,

00:33:55.320 --> 00:34:00.960
and submerged about
60,000 of the plates.

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:03.390
But all is well.

00:34:03.390 --> 00:34:07.300
The entire collection was in
the process of being digitized,

00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:11.210
because the plates are still in
use, and it's awkward to have to go

00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:15.520
to Harvard, and handle
these very fragile plates.

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:19.980
So much better if they'll all
be available online to anybody.

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:23.880
But the digitization equipment,
which was all custom built,

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:27.800
was also drowned in the flood.

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:30.900
But the insurance money
has paid for new equipment,

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:33.730 position:56%
which is faster, better and cheaper.

00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:36.540
And, so, they are moving along.

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:42.320
And they probably will finish the
project more or less on schedule.

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:45.020
How many people have
seen "Hidden Figures?"

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:50.010
Yeah. So, as I said, I do believe
there's a direct connection.

00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:54.870
And the woman standing next to the
movie poster is Alyssa Goodman,

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:57.380
who's a Professor of
Astronomy at Harvard.

00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:02.510 position:56%
Her, what looks like a NASA t-shirt,
but it actually says "Nasty,"--

00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:07.040
[ Laughter and Applause ]

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:10.560
And she is one of the people I
asked to be a technical expert,

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:15.260
because I wanted the astronomy
to be all correct, of course.

00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:19.040
And she got completely sidetracked
by the story of the women.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:21.530
And told me, "I've worked
here all these years.

00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:22.830
I know these names.

00:35:22.830 --> 00:35:27.020
But I always thought they were
doing something cute or quaint.

00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:30.330
I never realized they were
actually doing science."

00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:33.970
So she said she needed
to have me come up

00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:35.290
and teach them their history.

00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:38.570
So we actually had the book
launch in the observatory.

00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:42.950
This is one of my very
favorite pictures of them,

00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:47.000
also obviously staged, because
so many of them are here.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.960
That's Margaret Harwood
sitting on the floor.

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:52.650
And Antonia Maury just behind her.

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:58.190
And toward the back is Miss
Cannon, too busy to look up.

00:35:58.190 --> 00:36:00.670
Cecilia Payne is at
the drafting table.

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:03.880
And they were a great
group, very convivial.

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:07.870
They worked together
six days a week,

00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:12.200
and they socialized
on Saturday night.

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:17.030 position:56%
And I'm noticing from my signs that
we have only about ten minutes left.

00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:18.950
So I'm going to stop here.

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:23.190
And ask you to come
up and ask questions.

00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:27.180
I think there will be questions.

00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:28.980
If not, okay--

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:37.200
[ Applause ]

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:40.080
&gt;&gt; Hi. Thank you very much
for your book, first of all.

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:42.680
I've started reading it,
and I'm really enjoying it.

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:43.980
&gt;&gt; Dava Sobel: Thank you.

00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:47.120
&gt;&gt; And I just wanted to know how
you got started in science writing.

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:51.060
I mean I have an interest
in science myself.

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:53.550
But I haven't really
thought about writing it.

00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:54.850
I'm a technical writer.

00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:56.150
So I'm just curious.

00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:57.450
&gt;&gt; Dava Sobel: Okay.

00:36:57.450 --> 00:37:01.250
Well, I wish somebody had told me
about science writing when I was

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:05.700
in high school, because I was
always interested in science,

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:07.610
and I always liked to write.

00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:11.610
And I had no idea that I
could put the two together.

00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:14.400
And it was a long unhappy road

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:18.530
through college with
that split idea.

00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:22.810
And I got hired by IBM
as a technical writer,

00:37:22.810 --> 00:37:25.270
because they recruited on campus.

00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:28.010
And I still didn't know
what I wanted to do.

00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:32.550
But I learned quickly that I was
not a fit for the corporate world.

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:36.300
And I was going to
go back to school,

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:39.910
because the thing I really always
loved to do was write term papers.

00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:42.890
So I thought I'd go
to graduate school

00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:45.260
and write some more term
papers while I figured

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:46.560
out what I was going to do.

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:48.620
And I bumped into a friend of mine

00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:51.540
who was working at
the local newspaper.

00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:53.860
And she said they had an opening,

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:55.530
and why didn't I come
down and apply.

00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:58.830
And, you know, it was such a
random thing to bump into her,

00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:00.710
and then to go and follow up on it.

00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:02.010
But that's what I did.

00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:04.970 position:56%
And I got hired on the women's pages

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:07.850
of the Binghamton Evening
and Sunday Press.

00:38:07.850 --> 00:38:12.850
And within that first week I felt,

00:38:12.850 --> 00:38:14.960
"So this is what I'm
supposed to be doing."

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:18.360
And it was great, because it was
the year of the first Earth Day.

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:24.030
So I was writing about
conservation issues, pollution,

00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:28.120
genetic counseling was
just coming into practice.

00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:30.910
So there was a lot of
science to write about.

00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:34.350 position:56%
And because it was the women's pages
nobody really cared what I did.

00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:37.170
I had a lot of freedom.

00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:38.960
And it was great.

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:40.550
We still have the women's pages.

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:46.180
You know, we just call them
"style" and "dining" and "living."

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:47.480
Yes.

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:50.100
&gt;&gt; How long did it take to
produce one of the plates?

00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:54.550
And how long does it take to
digitize one of the plates?

00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:55.850
&gt;&gt; Dava Sobel: Thank you.

00:38:55.850 --> 00:38:58.640
Some of the plates are
very long exposures.

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:05.410
So they represent several hours
of telescope tracking time.

00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:10.270
And it was very difficult
work to get good images.

00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:14.120
There were automated clock
drives on the telescopes.

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.710
But they didn't always work well.

00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:23.370
So the individuals who made the
plates really developed the art

00:39:23.370 --> 00:39:25.510
of doing that work.

00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:28.670
Then they had to be developed.

00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:31.940
And depending where you were,
if you were in South America,

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:33.770
you had to get them
back to Cambridge.

00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:38.380
And sometimes there were arguments
about should we look at them here

00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:42.010
in South America, because
maybe something is interesting

00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:44.090
and important in this
plate that we should follow

00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:46.290
up right away while we can.

00:39:46.290 --> 00:39:50.200
Whereas the women back in
Cambridge really wanted the credit

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:52.190
for making the discoveries.

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:57.890
So that became a friction
point at one point.

00:39:57.890 --> 00:40:02.320
And as for the digitization
process, it took a long time

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:06.040
to figure out how to do it.

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:07.560
The plates all had to be cleaned.

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:11.750
So those markings, anything
that's going to be digitized,

00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:13.310
all that has to be wiped off.

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:16.270
So all the plates had to
be photographed first,

00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:18.660
so that the markings were
preserved in some way.

00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:24.000
Some of them are considered
too historic to erase.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.330
The equipment had to be built.

00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:27.440
I think once they actually get it

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:31.950
on the machine the scanning
probably takes under a minute.

00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:37.050
But I will, if you stick around
and give me your email address,

00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:42.090
I will get you an exact answer
to how long the scanning takes.

00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:43.580
Not very long.

00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:51.220 position:56%
And they do them a big rush assembly
line now to get it all done.

00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:52.520
Thanks.

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:53.820
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:55.120
&gt;&gt; Dava Sobel: Yes.

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:56.420
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:57.720
I was just in the talk
earlier by the author

00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:00.410
on "Hidden Figures,"
and now in your talk.

00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:06.770 position:56%
And yet today we struggle with women
and African-Americans in particular,

00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:08.830
you know, and their ability to be,

00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:11.210
not their ability to
be, their acceptance-

00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:12.510
&gt;&gt; Dava Sobel: Their acceptance.

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:15.650
&gt;&gt; As scientists in
many of the STEM fields.

00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:19.870
Are there lessons you've learned
that would be appropriate both

00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:24.460 position:56%
for those faculty who are making the
decisions of which women come in,

00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:27.300
or which minorities are
allowed into programs,

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:30.330
or to the actual women themselves?

00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:32.530
&gt;&gt; Dava Sobel: I think probably one

00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:39.510
of the most important answers is
the presentation of role models,

00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:45.140
both to young women looking
to have that sort of future,

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:47.440
and to people hiring to realize.

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:50.420
You know, most people can
name only one woman scientist.

00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:52.000
And it's Marie Curie.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:58.670
So to be able to show a whole room
full of people, a whole lab full

00:41:58.670 --> 00:42:02.560
of people, is an important thing.

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:03.860
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:07.060
&gt;&gt; Thanks for this
great presentation.

00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:08.400
I just wanted to say that your book

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:12.240
"Longitude" is my favorite
non-fiction book of all time.

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:13.540
&gt;&gt; Dava Sobel: Oh, thank you.

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:15.790
Thank you very much.

00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:19.080
Thank you.

00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:20.380
Thank you.

00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:25.420
&gt;&gt; I'm amused by your remarks
about how you got into your field.

00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:28.910
My Jewish mother would
have called that the shift,

00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:30.720
which in Yiddish means faith.

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:34.460
So your faith took
you to your career.

00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:36.010
But that's not my question.

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:37.880
My question is--

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:40.010
&gt;&gt; Dava Sobel: Good, because I
don't have an answer for that.

00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:41.340
[ Laughter ]

00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:44.110
&gt;&gt; My question relates
to those plates

00:42:44.110 --> 00:42:46.780
that had multiple stars
on one plate.

00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:48.080
&gt;&gt; Dava Sobel: Yeah.

00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:51.430
&gt;&gt; Now I understand you could
magnify individual stars

00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:53.100
and analyze them.

00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:57.070
But when you magnify an image
you lose something in resolution.

00:42:57.070 --> 00:43:02.490
So I'm wondering did they
ever compare individual slides

00:43:02.490 --> 00:43:08.190
of individual stars with the plates
that had that star among lots

00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:12.490
of others to see whether you
actually did lose something

00:43:12.490 --> 00:43:16.130
in the resolution when you looked
at multiple ones on one slide?

00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:17.630
&gt;&gt; Dava Sobel: Yes, they did.

00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:22.090
And they satisfied themselves
that it worked well enough.

00:43:22.090 --> 00:43:25.280
&gt;&gt; Hi. Good afternoon.

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:26.580
Thank you for--

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:27.880
&gt;&gt; Dava Sobel: Hi.

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:29.180
&gt;&gt; Your talk.

00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:30.480
A friend of mine from
college is an astronomer.

00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:34.300
She works at Adler
Planetarium in Chicago.

00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:37.470
And I've always admired
her brain and her success.

00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:40.290
And I think she's great.

00:43:40.290 --> 00:43:44.390
And, you know, we're at the
age now, we're in our late 50s.

00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:48.140
Could you tell us like how like
the change for women in science

00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:51.380
and astronomy, from the women
that you profiled in this book,

00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:55.250
to now till, you know,
girls in grade school,

00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:59.020
high school who might be interested
in going to the field of astronomy?

00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:01.140
&gt;&gt; Dava Sobel: I'm not sure
I understand the question.

00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:02.440
Can I tell you--

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:03.740
&gt;&gt; Well, what has changed?

00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:05.040
And if someone--

00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:06.340
&gt;&gt; Dava Sobel: What has changed?

00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:07.640
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:08.940
&gt;&gt; Dava Sobel: Well, I think there
have been changes back and forth.

00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:13.420
I mean a situation like
this in the 1880s of having

00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:17.190
that many women working together
was highly unusual at the time.

00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:22.200
And yet the work that they did
was acknowledged and accepted.

00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:26.720
And the situation at
Harvard continued up till

00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:29.230
about the start of
the Second World War.

00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:33.320
After that there were
machine computers,

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:38.430
and less of an emphasis
on hiring women.

00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:43.230
I mean Pickering was a
man of great fairness.

00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:45.230
But he was also very practical.

00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:49.470
A room full of women cost a lot
less than a room full of men.

00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:51.100
It's still true.

00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:58.160 position:56%
So all I can say is may it continue.

00:44:58.160 --> 00:44:59.460
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:01.470 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dava Sobel: I think the one more,

00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:02.910
do we have time for
one last question?

00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:04.210
Yeah. Great.

00:45:04.210 --> 00:45:05.510
Perfect.

00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:06.810
&gt;&gt; Do you know what the glass
plates were treated with in order

00:45:06.810 --> 00:45:09.620
for the images to adhere
to the glass?

00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:12.740
&gt;&gt; Dava Sobel: You mean the actual
composition of the emulsion?

00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:15.330
No, I don't.

00:45:15.330 --> 00:45:17.010
I hate to end on that note.

00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:18.310
[ Laughter ]

00:45:18.310 --> 00:45:22.310
I don't like to pretend I know
something when I don't either.

00:45:22.310 --> 00:45:25.450
If you want to give me your
email address, I will find out.

00:45:25.450 --> 00:45:28.720
And, of course, the
emulsion is one of the things

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:32.400
that people worry about, why
the digitization is necessary,

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:36.590
because eventually the emulsion
separates from the plate.

00:45:36.590 --> 00:45:40.370
And then you're left with nothing.

00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:43.100
So thank you.
