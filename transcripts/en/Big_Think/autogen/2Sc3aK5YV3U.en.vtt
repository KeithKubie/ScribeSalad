estates projects so basically there's

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409
estates projects so basically there's
 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.920
estates projects so basically there's
nine or eight editions of animal estates

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930
nine or eight editions of animal estates
 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.300

Whitney Museum there was a stream and it
 

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:28.119
Whitney Museum there was a stream and it
was likely a site of beavers and beavers

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:28.129

ponds so with the Whitney Museum I
decided to make a home homes for 12

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:33.889
decided to make a home homes for 12
 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:35.949

the museum
400 years ago so in that way I'm making

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340
400 years ago so in that way I'm making
 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.309
400 years ago so in that way I'm making
fully-functioning homes for animals that

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319
fully-functioning homes for animals that
 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.679
fully-functioning homes for animals that

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.100
space of the street so it's that
threshold that I've been working with in

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110
threshold that I've been working with in
 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.860
threshold that I've been working with in
a lot of ways lately anyway so I really

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870
a lot of ways lately anyway so I really
 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.870

to meet the people on the street and

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690
to meet the people on the street and

the people in the museum
so these animal homes and the stories of

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669
so these animal homes and the stories of
 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:40.240
so these animal homes and the stories of
them become a way to bridge those two

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250
them become a way to bridge those two
 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.640
them become a way to bridge those two

a a secondary thing that you make

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:52.340
a a secondary thing that you make
 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.100

interacting with it is this part of the

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:01.790
interacting with it is this part of the
 

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:03.220
interacting with it is this part of the
whole way the idea for the work was

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:03.230
whole way the idea for the work was
 

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:06.700
whole way the idea for the work was
generated I I created a project where

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:06.710
generated I I created a project where
 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:08.890
generated I I created a project where
there's the animal homes in the sunken

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:08.900
there's the animal homes in the sunken
 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.600
there's the animal homes in the sunken
sculpture Court and then around the

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:10.610
sculpture Court and then around the
 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.280
sculpture Court and then around the
perimeter at the sidewalk there's 12

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:12.290
perimeter at the sidewalk there's 12
 

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:16.150
perimeter at the sidewalk there's 12
plaques one for each 12 animals with the

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:16.160
plaques one for each 12 animals with the
 

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.030
plaques one for each 12 animals with the
animal in first person telling you about

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:19.040
animal in first person telling you about
 

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.950
animal in first person telling you about
their home so the project is really

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:23.960
their home so the project is really
 

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.690
their home so the project is really
designed to be experienced from the

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:25.700
designed to be experienced from the
 

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.790
designed to be experienced from the
street from the sidewalk not necessarily

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:27.800
street from the sidewalk not necessarily
 

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.350
street from the sidewalk not necessarily
by people who are going into the museum

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:29.360
by people who are going into the museum
 

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:34.950
by people who are going into the museum
so I really viewed it as a project for

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:34.960
 
 

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.290
 
anyone who's passing by that can get

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:38.300
anyone who's passing by that can get
 

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.390
anyone who's passing by that can get
drawn into the story by these these

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:40.400
drawn into the story by these these
 

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.490
drawn into the story by these these
plaques and these stories by these

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:42.500
plaques and these stories by these
 

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:46.140
plaques and these stories by these
animals so I had the benefit of starting

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:46.150
animals so I had the benefit of starting
 

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:47.920
animals so I had the benefit of starting
installation about two or three weeks

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:47.930
installation about two or three weeks
 

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:49.660
installation about two or three weeks
before anyone else did and it's already

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:49.670
before anyone else did and it's already
 

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:51.790
before anyone else did and it's already
been installed now in place for a few

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:51.800
been installed now in place for a few
 

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.650
been installed now in place for a few
weeks so I've been really interested to

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:53.660
weeks so I've been really interested to
 

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:57.100
weeks so I've been really interested to
see how people have experienced it and

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:57.110
see how people have experienced it and
 

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:58.360
see how people have experienced it and
it's really nice to sit down in the

00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:58.370
it's really nice to sit down in the
 

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:00.130
it's really nice to sit down in the
sculpture court look up and see these

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:00.140
sculpture court look up and see these
 

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.980
sculpture court look up and see these
faces pop up read the plaques look

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:02.990
faces pop up read the plaques look
 

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:04.840
faces pop up read the plaques look
around you know there's the the Bobcat

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:04.850
around you know there's the the Bobcat
 

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:06.550
