00:00:07.222 --> 00:00:09.452
Giant gold-digging ants,

00:00:09.452 --> 00:00:14.181
a furious king who orders
the sea to be whipped 300 times,

00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:18.802
and a dolphin that saves
a famous poet from drowning.

00:00:18.802 --> 00:00:22.762
These are just some of the stories
from The Histories by Herodotus,

00:00:22.762 --> 00:00:26.761
an Ancient Greek writer from
the 5th century BCE.

00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:29.043
Not all the events in the text 
may have happened

00:00:29.043 --> 00:00:31.253
exactly as Herodotus reported them,

00:00:31.253 --> 00:00:35.883
but this work revolutionized
the way the past was recorded.

00:00:35.883 --> 00:00:40.222
Before Herodotus, the past was documented
as a list of events

00:00:40.222 --> 00:00:42.934
with little or no attempt to explain
their causes

00:00:42.934 --> 00:00:47.153
beyond accepting things
as the will of the gods.

00:00:47.153 --> 00:00:50.383
Herodotus wanted a deeper,
more rational understanding,

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:52.193
so he took a new approach:

00:00:52.193 --> 00:00:57.695
looking at events from both sides
to understand the reasons for them.

00:00:57.695 --> 00:01:01.195
Though he was Greek, Herodotus's
hometown of Halicarnassus

00:01:01.195 --> 00:01:03.874
was part of the Persian Empire.

00:01:03.874 --> 00:01:07.663
He grew up during a series of wars
between the powerful Persians

00:01:07.663 --> 00:01:09.665
and the smaller Greeks,

00:01:09.665 --> 00:01:13.885
and decided to find out all he could
about the subject.

00:01:13.885 --> 00:01:18.774
In Herodotus's telling, the Persian Wars
began in 499 BCE,

00:01:18.774 --> 00:01:23.994
when the Athenians assisted a rebellion
by Greeks living under Persian rule.

00:01:23.994 --> 00:01:30.595
In 490, the Persian King, Darius,
sent his army to take revenge on Athens.

00:01:30.595 --> 00:01:35.776
But at the Battle of Marathon,
the Athenians won an unexpected victory.

00:01:35.776 --> 00:01:40.535
Ten years later, the Persians returned,
planning to conquer the whole of Greece

00:01:40.535 --> 00:01:44.396
under the leadership 
of Darius's son, Xerxes.

00:01:44.396 --> 00:01:47.216
According to Herodotus,
when Xerxes arrived,

00:01:47.216 --> 00:01:51.335
his million man army was initially
opposed by a Greek force

00:01:51.335 --> 00:01:56.544
led by 300 Spartans at the mountain pass
of Thermopylae.

00:01:56.544 --> 00:01:58.286
At great cost to the Persians,

00:01:58.286 --> 00:02:02.496
the Spartans and their king, Leonidas,
were killed.

00:02:02.496 --> 00:02:07.687
This heroic defeat has been an inspiration
to underdogs ever since.

00:02:07.687 --> 00:02:11.277
A few weeks later, the Greek navy
tricked the Persian fleet

00:02:11.277 --> 00:02:14.937
into fighting in a narrow sea channel
near Athens.

00:02:14.937 --> 00:02:20.307
The Persians were defeated and Xerxes
fled, never to return.

00:02:20.307 --> 00:02:23.897
To explain how these wars broke out
and why the Greeks triumphed,

00:02:23.897 --> 00:02:28.187
Herodotus collected stories
from all around the Mediterranean.

00:02:28.187 --> 00:02:31.447
He recorded the achievements of both
Greeks and non-Greeks

00:02:31.447 --> 00:02:34.568
before they were lost
to the passage of time.

00:02:34.568 --> 00:02:38.148
The Histories opens 
with the famous sentence:

00:02:38.148 --> 00:02:42.089
"Herodotus, of Halicarnassus, 
here displays his inquiries."

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:44.170
By framing the book as an “inquiry,”

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.309
Herodotus allowed it to contain 
many different stories,

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:50.409
some serious, others less so.

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:52.938
He recorded the internal debates
of the Persian court

00:02:52.938 --> 00:02:56.218
but also tales of Egyptian flying snakes

00:02:56.218 --> 00:03:00.579
and practical advice 
on how to catch a crocodile.

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.458
The Greek word for this method
of research is "autopsy,"

00:03:03.458 --> 00:03:06.379
meaning "seeing for oneself."

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:08.970
Herodotus was the first writer
to examine the past

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.816
by combining the different kinds
of evidence he collected:

00:03:12.816 --> 00:03:15.007
opsis, or eyewitness accounts,

00:03:15.007 --> 00:03:17.124
akoe, or hearsay,

00:03:17.124 --> 00:03:19.824
and ta legomena, or tradition.

00:03:19.824 --> 00:03:22.350
He then used gnome, or reason,

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.350
to reach conclusions 
about what actually happened.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.780
Many of the book's early readers
were actually listeners.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.256
The Histories was originally written
in 28 sections,

00:03:33.256 --> 00:03:37.261
each of which took about 
four hours to read aloud.

00:03:37.261 --> 00:03:40.331
As the Greeks increased in influence
and power,

00:03:40.331 --> 00:03:46.473
Herodotus's writing and the idea of history
spread across the Mediterranean.

00:03:46.473 --> 00:03:49.934
As the first proper historian,
Herodotus wasn't perfect.

00:03:49.934 --> 00:03:53.039
On occasions, he favored
the Greeks over the Persians

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:56.416
and was too quick to believe
some of the stories that he heard,

00:03:56.416 --> 00:03:59.121
which made for inaccuracies.

00:03:59.121 --> 00:04:01.862
However, modern evidence 
has actually explained

00:04:01.862 --> 00:04:04.950
some of his apparently extreme claims.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.742
For instance, there's a species 
of marmot in the Himalayas

00:04:08.742 --> 00:04:11.638
that spreads gold dust while digging.

00:04:11.638 --> 00:04:16.828
The ancient Persian word for marmot
is quite close to the word for ant,

00:04:16.828 --> 00:04:21.728
so Herodotus may have just fallen prey
to a translation error.

00:04:21.728 --> 00:04:25.691
All in all, for someone who was writing
in an entirely new style,

00:04:25.691 --> 00:04:28.159
Herodotus did remarkably well.

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:32.838
History, right down to the present day, 
has always suffered from the partiality

00:04:32.838 --> 00:04:35.239
and mistakes of historians.

00:04:35.239 --> 00:04:38.299
Herodotus’s method 
and creativity earned him the title

00:04:38.299 --> 00:04:42.601
that the Roman author Cicero 
gave him several hundred years later:

00:04:42.601 --> 00:04:45.120
"The Father of History."
