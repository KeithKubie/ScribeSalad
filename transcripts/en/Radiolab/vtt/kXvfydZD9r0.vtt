00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.450
This is more perfect. I'm Jad Abumrad.

2
00:00:03.031 --> 00:00:07.080
So last season we profiled a guy named Edward Bloom.

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.850
This is a guy who, according to his critics,

4
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.330
had almost single handedly rolled back decades of civil rights law basically by

5
00:00:18.271 --> 00:00:20.880
himself. Wasn't a lawyer, wasn't a politician,

6
00:00:20.881 --> 00:00:25.881
but somehow he sort of found this way to play the courts to cook up just the

7
00:00:27.841 --> 00:00:31.230
right case, find just the right plaintiff to target voting rights,

8
00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:32.011
affirmative action,

9
00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:36.750
all kinds of different laws that take race into account seem to us at the time

10
00:00:36.751 --> 00:00:39.880
that he was sort of this hidden architect, not too much was known about him.

11
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.050
In fact, at the time that we did the story,

12
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.220
there was a big case of his targeting informative action that was coming before

13
00:00:47.221 --> 00:00:50.850
the Supreme Court. And there were these moments where his plaintiff, plaintiff,

14
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.010
he had found this young white woman, Abby Fisher,

15
00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:57.830
was on the steps of the Supreme Court giving an interview and he would literally

16
00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:58.130
be,

17
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.670
<v 1>be behind her in the shadows, like almost at the edge of the frame.</v>

18
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.410
Which one's a no, like who is this guy? What's his story?

19
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.150
So A, we produce a profile and a,

20
00:01:11.151 --> 00:01:16.151
what I'd like to do in this podcast is update that profile because recently I

21
00:01:16.311 --> 00:01:21.311
talked to Ed Blum again about what he's up to now and it's really interesting,

22
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.600
maybe troubling depending on where you stand. So gonna play, uh,

23
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.900
a chunk of the original just to sort of set the context and then follow it with

24
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:31.611
the new interview.

25
00:01:31.611 --> 00:01:36.140
And if you'd rather not hear the original skip to about minute 17,

26
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.430
otherwise, producer Catherine Wells starts us off again. We wanted to know like,

27
00:01:40.431 --> 00:01:42.920
who is this guy? So she paid him a visit.

28
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.140
<v 2>Yeah. So I went to Tallahassee. That's where he lives,</v>

29
00:01:47.141 --> 00:01:51.670
or he winters in Tallahassee. Oh Man. Golden retriever.

30
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.090
You walk in. What initially struck you?

31
00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.590
His golden retriever is what initially struck me.

32
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.450
Literally physically nice meeting you. Of course.

33
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.200
And I don't know what I was expecting, but when you hear about these cases,

34
00:02:08.201 --> 00:02:12.970
you know, there, I mean, critics are really, people are mad about these cases.

35
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.910
It is deeply disturbing, truly outrageous.

36
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.100
So betrayal of the American people.

37
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.160
So I go to meet him and your flight from Austin to Dallas to Tallahassee.

38
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.880
Uneventful and on time and good. Yep. Good.

39
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.840
He's like a totally nice guy. A regular guy was,

40
00:02:31.841 --> 00:02:33.190
he looked like like a dad.

41
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.180
There is something in me that just loves tradition and custom.

42
00:02:37.181 --> 00:02:41.500
He loves listening to the great American songbook. Life is a beautiful thing.

43
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.450
A Frank Sinatra. As long as I hold this string and

44
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.110
Ella Fitzgerald in heaven. I love art and museums. Uh,

45
00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.520
independent films. Golf. What's this guy's backstory? Well,

46
00:02:57.521 --> 00:03:02.521
he's 64 I born in a small town in Michigan.

47
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.570
My Dad owned a shoe store there. My mom worked with him in the shoe store.

48
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.440
What had been your kind of political leanings up to this point or, well,

49
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.890
I'm the first republican my mother ever met,

50
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.830
hate to use the word typical,

51
00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:22.030
but it really was a typical liberal Jewish household.

52
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.740
My mother and father were Franklin Roosevelt. Harry Truman,

53
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.040
Democrats always voted Democrat, Minnesota.

54
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.330
He was that way too. All the way through college.

55
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.020
The University of Texas Grad School, State University of New York,

56
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.050
where I spent a year studying of all things

57
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.250
African literature,

58
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.480
but he says somewhere along the way his political leanings and sort of started

59
00:03:49.481 --> 00:03:52.570
to shift. I spent a summer in Israel

60
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.050
living on a kibbutz and he says he came out of that experience a little less

61
00:03:59.051 --> 00:04:00.760
liberal than he was before

62
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.090
and you got married and then in the early eighties he's living in Houston

63
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.350
working as a stock broker

64
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.960
and we met aren't our neighbors,

65
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.510
this particular couple, they were New Yorkers who had moved to Houston,

66
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.530
both grew up as liberals and the guy,

67
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.590
he sort of opened my eyes to the world of the neo-cons.

68
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.410
The guy introduced him to these magazines,

69
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.630
weekly Standard National Review Commentary magazine,

70
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.120
like conservative magazines,

71
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.300
and this was around the time that the neo-con movement was really hitting its

72
00:04:40.301 --> 00:04:45.070
stride. You had all these New York liberals defecting is what he says.

73
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.100
Thousands of individuals who grew up in the 1960s that started to question the

74
00:04:51.341 --> 00:04:55.540
wisdom of these liberal policies. And he says slowly,

75
00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.520
slowly over time, very gradually he became one of those people.

76
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.200
And any case, fast forward a little bit, he's living in Houston,

77
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:10.230
kind of a garden variety existence and something happens that sends him on this

78
00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:15.040
entirely new path. Basically, he and his wife moved to a new neighborhood.

79
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.850
They moved from the suburbs into the downtown area, more urban.

80
00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.910
And in 1990 when we went to vote for the first time in our new neighborhood,

81
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.160
I realized that the Republican Party had not fielded a candidate to oppose the

82
00:05:33.551 --> 00:05:36.550
Democrat incumbent running for Congress.

83
00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.610
This is a district that has almost 600,000 people and you don't have a choice.

84
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:49.000
You've only got one person running. Blum decided to run himself.

85
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.180
I lost. I don't, that was no great surprise to anyone.

86
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.100
I actually lost by 32 points.

87
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.670
But along the way as something really happened, um,

88
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.530
during that campaign, he and his wife Lark, you know,

89
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.970
they decided they were going to go meet voters in their district.

90
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.530
They got a giant printouts of all of the addresses in the 18th congressional

91
00:06:09.531 --> 00:06:12.500
district to what was then called a walking list.

92
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.870
And they just started going door to door meeting people,

93
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.500
handing out literature and they'd walk down say Oak Street.

94
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.560
I would take the even side of Oak Street and my wife would take the odd numbered

95
00:06:26.301 --> 00:06:30.950
side of Oak Street and we would start to walk and,

96
00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:36.170
and he says very quickly they realized that the districts shape was funny.

97
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.510
Some houses on one side of the street would be in the district and then houses

98
00:06:41.511 --> 00:06:42.500
on the other side wouldn't.

99
00:06:42.501 --> 00:06:45.440
And sometimes the district would sneak down a highway,

100
00:06:45.441 --> 00:06:49.880
catch an apartment complex, come back. It just didn't make sense.

101
00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.460
This is lark bloom wife of Edward Bloom.

102
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:57.520
It was peculiar because we had maps that we had to follow and it was very odd

103
00:06:58.821 --> 00:07:02.390
the way some streets were in the districts and some weren't.

104
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.830
Took a while for it all to really sink in as to how this could happen. After,

105
00:07:06.831 --> 00:07:08.600
I guess about a week of this,

106
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:13.990
we realized that neighbors had been separated almost house by house because of

107
00:07:18.231 --> 00:07:19.370
their race.

108
00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:26.550
He comes to believe that the reason this was done was for the explicit purpose

109
00:07:26.551 --> 00:07:28.830
to create a majority African American district.

110
00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:31.870
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

111
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.030
<v 4>this is an untrue, that's acne</v>

112
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:37.810
flowed from a clear and simple wrong.

113
00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:42.490
<v 2>Part of the reason this was done was the voting rights act of 1960 5 million.</v>

114
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:42.820
<v 4>Oh,</v>

115
00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:47.820
the Americans are denied the right to vote because of their color.

116
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:53.420
<v 5>This act was a giant step forward in civil rights.</v>

117
00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:53.830
You know,

118
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:57.320
one of the primary things that did is eliminate barriers to voting like poll

119
00:07:57.321 --> 00:07:59.790
taxes and literacy tests. All these, you know,

120
00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:02.360
strategies that had been used to keep minorities from voting.

121
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:07.130
And then this other thing it did sort of in a roundabout way through a series of

122
00:08:07.131 --> 00:08:12.131
interpretations is it encouraged the creation of districts where the majority of

123
00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:13.970
voters were minorities.

124
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.590
And that's because one of the strategies that had been used previously to,

125
00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:19.670
um,

126
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:24.670
sort of dilute the minority vote was to take minority communities and they

127
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:25.750
called it cracking. They,

128
00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.450
they sort of split them apart into many different districts so that they were

129
00:08:29.451 --> 00:08:33.540
never in the majority enough to elect a representative. Right.

130
00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.050
So the voting rights act tried to correct that.

131
00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:41.530
The 18th congressional district was one of these majority minority districts

132
00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:41.830
<v 2>districts.</v>

133
00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:46.830
The district was drawn by the Texas legislature to have a slight African

134
00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:51.370
American majority, I think about 51% African American.

135
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:53.350
But this was the problem according to bloom,

136
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:57.870
the way they got to that African American majority was by creating this district

137
00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:00.390
that zigzagged all over the city and cut through neighborhoods.

138
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:03.870
I could not understand. People live close together.

139
00:09:03.871 --> 00:09:06.300
They sent their kids to the neighborhood schools.

140
00:09:06.301 --> 00:09:09.120
They shopped in the neighborhood shopping centers.

141
00:09:09.121 --> 00:09:14.121
They were worried about neighborhood issues to break these neighborhoods apart

142
00:09:14.131 --> 00:09:18.360
by race seemed so wrong to me.

143
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.740
In his mind,

144
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:23.970
this law was actually not limiting discrimination,

145
00:09:23.971 --> 00:09:26.500
but actually perpetuating it. Well, yeah.

146
00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:32.060
And I don't know what the average person upon realizing this would have done,

147
00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.640
but I decided to file a lawsuit.

148
00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:40.430
GE decided to sue the state of Texas,

149
00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.460
called a few friends who lived in the 18th district,

150
00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:48.140
a racially diverse group of people and African American, Hispanic, and an Asian.

151
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:52.850
Kept looking and looking and looking until I found a lawyer that I could afford

152
00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:54.050
$7,000 a month.

153
00:09:54.051 --> 00:09:59.051
We filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Texas's redistricting

154
00:09:59.451 --> 00:10:03.020
plan. The basic charge was yes, the voting rights act was good in its day,

155
00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:07.340
but now it was being used as this excuse to segregate people into racially

156
00:10:07.341 --> 00:10:11.480
polarized districts. Kid worked its way through the lower courts.

157
00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:16.540
And to my shock and surprise in 1995

158
00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:22.400
<v 6>well, your argument now, no number 94 eight oh five George W.</v>

159
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.570
Bush versus Alvera,

160
00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:27.530
<v 2>the Supreme Court took it up and you went to oral arguments. Yeah, we all did.</v>

161
00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:29.020
<v 6>Mr. Keith testified made please.</v>

162
00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:31.250
<v 2>All right, so there we all are.</v>

163
00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.990
Our opponents stepped to the lectern and okay,

164
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.120
<v 6>you can this direct appeal if the constitutionality of three congressional</v>

165
00:10:39.121 --> 00:10:39.580
districts,

166
00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:41.340
<v 2>they make their arguments.</v>

167
00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.370
<v 6>Hello erroneous. We rule where racially Gerrymander,</v>

168
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:48.670
<v 2>Texas basically said, y'all, we have to put people together by race.</v>

169
00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:53.740
<v 6>The Texas legislature has the obligation to satisfied federal requirements in</v>

170
00:10:54.141 --> 00:10:56.030
the voting rights act is a federal requirement.

171
00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:57.890
<v 2>Like remember the voting rights act.</v>

172
00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:01.100
We're trying to make sure that there are enough minorities in this district so

173
00:11:01.101 --> 00:11:04.790
that they have a chance to elect a representative than our advocate,

174
00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:06.920
<v 6>the chief justice and may it please the court.</v>

175
00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:08.110
<v 2>His arguments.</v>

176
00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:09.720
<v 6>It's strict scrutiny. [inaudible]</v>

177
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:13.190
<v 2>Bloom's lawyer basically said, but look at the map.</v>

178
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:18.430
The map is bizarre and the only reason it could have gotten this way is because

179
00:11:19.761 --> 00:11:23.240
you're only thinking about race only race. Right? Think about it.

180
00:11:23.241 --> 00:11:25.010
That seems messed up. Isn't that messed up?

181
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:27.030
<v 6>It doesn't matter what your ultimate goal is.</v>

182
00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:29.730
You cannot use certain forbidding tools.

183
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:32.870
Race is forbidden by the 14th amendment to be used as a tool in,

184
00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:35.600
in handling all the people at St Mary's. Yes.

185
00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:38.110
<v 2>You know, it's a very tense situation. Okay.</v>

186
00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:39.870
<v 6>I'm not asking you about your situation.</v>

187
00:11:39.871 --> 00:11:44.040
Do you know any other situation in the mall in which we allow race to be used

188
00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:45.990
as, it's not like it's fine to be unconstitutional,

189
00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:48.570
but to use it as a more cross domain. How was this done?

190
00:11:48.571 --> 00:11:52.510
I thought that's how you said they kind of see that or he'd be like, Hey,

191
00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:56.470
it would require [inaudible]. You did say that, didn't you? Let me explain.

192
00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:00.350
Let me find that. Did you say that or no? We want to make me

193
00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:02.090
<v 5>so in the end,</v>

194
00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.120
the supreme court gives out this very

195
00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:12.800
hairsplitting decision that I think gets at this deeper question that in our

196
00:12:13.201 --> 00:12:15.480
society and in our discourse,

197
00:12:15.481 --> 00:12:17.850
we just haven't figured out how to talk about it in a way.

198
00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.220
And it basically said this, you know, look,

199
00:12:20.221 --> 00:12:23.550
if you're defining race just as the color of someone's skin,

200
00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:28.350
the government cannot use that in any way. That's against the constitution.

201
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:29.333
On the other hand,

202
00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:34.490
if you take this wider view and you look at race in the context of history,

203
00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:35.910
social context,

204
00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:39.870
then how can the government address discrimination without taking race into

205
00:12:39.871 --> 00:12:43.290
account? They have to. So it's this difficult balance.

206
00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:44.440
<v 2>You can't look at race,</v>

207
00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:49.270
but you have to look at race and the Supreme Court says to Texas,

208
00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:49.960
look,

209
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.200
all you're doing in this case is sorting people based on how they're labeled on

210
00:12:53.201 --> 00:12:55.900
a census. You're not looking at that wider context.

211
00:12:55.901 --> 00:12:58.660
You're not looking at if these communities live next to each other,

212
00:12:58.661 --> 00:12:59.950
if they share common interests,

213
00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:04.100
you're just sorting them based on race alone and that's not good enough.

214
00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:07.370
You can't do that. When the opinion came down,

215
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:10.850
the supreme court ruled in our favor, five to four.

216
00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:14.630
That was quite a day.

217
00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.150
The day that we won that lawsuit, I was,

218
00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:24.270
ah, I've got the world on a string hooked forever.

219
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:28.800
After that, Edward Bloom decided that this would be his thing.

220
00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.690
It became a passion.

221
00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:35.280
You would use the courts to try to strike down every race based policy he could

222
00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:38.220
have. The legal team was taken on the road.

223
00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:41.910
I recruited plaintiffs in New York for Virginia,

224
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
South Carolina to challenge Congressional district plans and we won in each of

225
00:13:48.121 --> 00:13:48.870
those states.

226
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:53.310
He helped sue school districts in Florida and Texas to end the use of racial

227
00:13:53.311 --> 00:13:56.280
quotas in k through 12 magnet schools.

228
00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:59.480
[inaudible] after affirmative action in Houston city contracting today,

229
00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:02.460
Houston could become the first city to kill affirmative action.

230
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:04.920
That one was actually a valid initiative and it failed,

231
00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:08.460
but I've been the architect of over two dozen lawsuits,

232
00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:13.640
six of which six made it to the supreme court, including

233
00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:19.580
in 2013 and a five to four vote five to four very divided court.

234
00:14:19.581 --> 00:14:24.581
The Supreme Court today struck down a key part of the voting rights act of 1965

235
00:14:25.041 --> 00:14:28.340
supreme court today struck down a very important part of the voting rights act.

236
00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:31.010
He 1965 landmark law.

237
00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:35.300
It's considered one of the most important pieces of civil rights legislation

238
00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:37.620
ever passed. Shelby county versus holder.

239
00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:42.000
This decision gutted the voting rights act. Specifically.

240
00:14:42.001 --> 00:14:44.940
There was this part of it that said states and counties with a history of

241
00:14:44.941 --> 00:14:49.110
discrimination have to check with the federal government first before they go

242
00:14:49.111 --> 00:14:52.280
about changing their voting laws. Basically the federal was saying, look,

243
00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:55.010
<v 1>you've been up to all this stuff where now we're watching you.</v>

244
00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:59.040
The Supreme Court said, you know, times have changed.

245
00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:03.330
That list was made a long time ago, and it's outdated.

246
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:08.750
This decision restores an important constitutional order to our system of

247
00:15:09.331 --> 00:15:13.800
government. This was Bloom's biggest victory when Shelby county came down.

248
00:15:13.801 --> 00:15:14.970
I burst into tears.

249
00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:18.870
I think a lot of people burst into tears when that came down. You know, it it,

250
00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:20.940
yeah, I understand it

251
00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:24.350
<v 7>deeply disturbing. I am deeply disappointed,</v>

252
00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:27.890
deeply disappointed with the courts decision in this matter. Yes.

253
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.560
Decision as a beat trail of the American peaky.

254
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:34.430
That was a game changer. During the civil rights movement,

255
00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:36.830
people died for the precious right to vote.

256
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:39.870
<v 1>Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston, Texas.</v>

257
00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:43.370
<v 7>I would like to have the Supreme Court justice as go back in time.</v>

258
00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:45.770
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

259
00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:48.500
<v 7>go back in time and March with those who marched</v>

260
00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:50.293
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

261
00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:53.340
<v 7>after bloody Sunday. I'm from Selma to Montgomery.</v>

262
00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:55.650
Ed Blum has a right to his opinion.

263
00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:59.090
<v 1>It doesn't mean that it has to be the opinion of the United States.</v>

264
00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:02.380
I understand that people were, you know,

265
00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:07.480
gravely upset and also know that there were people who were greatly relieved and

266
00:16:08.361 --> 00:16:11.420
gravely gratified. Yeah,

267
00:16:11.421 --> 00:16:15.870
but I think what gets a lot of people is that you look at the civil rights

268
00:16:15.871 --> 00:16:18.000
videos, you see tens of thousands,

269
00:16:18.001 --> 00:16:22.650
40,000 people in the streets marching and you hold that and if you make a split

270
00:16:22.651 --> 00:16:24.940
screen in your mind, you hold that thousands,

271
00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:29.040
tens of thousands of people on one side, on the other side, you one guy,

272
00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:33.480
it does make you ask basic questions about democracy. That's a false paradigm.

273
00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:38.070
It's, that may be your split screen,

274
00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:41.700
but that's really not the reality of all of this.

275
00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:46.240
You look in 1964 1965, uh,

276
00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:51.250
America was held hostage by the legacies of slavery and the chokehold of Jim

277
00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:57.173
Crow.

278
00:16:57.210 --> 00:17:02.210
Fast forward to 2006 the reauthorization of the voting rights act,

279
00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:09.420
the chokehold had gone away.

280
00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:15.020
African Americans in the deep south registered to vote in numbers that often

281
00:17:16.561 --> 00:17:18.120
exceeded whites,

282
00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:23.360
participated in elections and numbers that exceeded whites in terms of electoral

283
00:17:26.491 --> 00:17:27.510
opportunities.

284
00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:32.760
We have come on 180 degrees from 1960 before we turn those degrees because of

285
00:17:36.481 --> 00:17:38.860
the law, which you've helped overturn and, and, and,

286
00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:42.400
and we don't know to what degree that is the psychology of America changing or

287
00:17:42.401 --> 00:17:47.110
the fact that we had a law that kept people in line and now that law is gone and

288
00:17:47.111 --> 00:17:49.710
now we see voter ID laws coming back into play,

289
00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:53.290
which I think any like sane person would admit is it is, it is,

290
00:17:53.291 --> 00:17:56.050
it is an attempt, a blatant attempt to disenfranchise people.

291
00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:59.250
So it feels a little bit strange to, I mean, I completely agree with you.

292
00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:01.330
Things have gotten better at the same time. I think,

293
00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:05.350
well that was because of the law that's now gone. Um, look,

294
00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:09.880
laws change, laws evolve and,

295
00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:13.930
and at some point they need to come to an end.

296
00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:19.613
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

297
00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:23.090
<v 1>so after winning the Shelby county case,</v>

298
00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:28.370
ed Blum turned his attention to affirmative action.

299
00:18:28.371 --> 00:18:32.510
Should universities be able to use racial preferences in college admissions?

300
00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.880
You found a young white woman named Abigail Fisher.

301
00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:37.970
Abigail Fisher believed her race may have hurt her chances to attend the

302
00:18:37.971 --> 00:18:39.200
University of Texas.

303
00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:42.430
<v 0>There were people in my class with lower grades who weren't in all the</v>

304
00:18:42.431 --> 00:18:45.370
activities I was in who were being accepted into ut.

305
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:48.460
And the only other difference between us was the color of our skin.

306
00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:51.850
<v 1>Case goes to the Supreme Court. And in that case,</v>

307
00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:55.710
<v 9>the Supreme Court has upheld the affirmative action program at the University of</v>

308
00:18:55.711 --> 00:18:57.100
Texas. Affirmative action.

309
00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:01.500
<v 1>Jenna and higher education is constitutional at bloom lost.</v>

310
00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:04.620
But at the end of that original piece,

311
00:19:04.621 --> 00:19:08.950
he made it clear to us he wasn't giving up. I'm a long distance runner. Uh,

312
00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:12.690
if there's something just emblematic about my personality,

313
00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.510
I run long distances.

314
00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:19.290
And even as the court was coming down with this decision against him,

315
00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:24.660
he was planning his next move that's coming up next after the break.

328
00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:12.440
I wonder if it is legal for president Trump to initiate military action against

North Korea.

330

What happens if Mueller turns on an indictment against the president?

334
00:20:35.851 --> 00:20:37.560
so now let's bring the action up to the present.

335
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:42.120
After Ed Blum lost that Supreme Court case against the University of Texas last

336
00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:42.750
year,

337
00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:47.440
he kept the case going on the state level and he took aim at two more schools.

338
00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:52.530
I have retained counsel to litigate Harvard's admissions policies and

339
00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.210
University of North Carolina's admissions policies.

340
00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:58.910
He formed an organization called students for fair admissions.

341
00:20:58.911 --> 00:21:03.911
And this time the target was perceived discrimination against Asian Americans.

342
00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:07.670
Case against Harvard is in the early stages,

343
00:21:07.671 --> 00:21:12.671
but I recently called them up to just kind of get an update on this crusade.

344
00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:16.700
The ultimate goal is to have the supreme court revisit.

345
00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.620
It's we think,

346
00:21:18.621 --> 00:21:23.450
unfortunate opinion and Fisher and end the use of race and ethnicity once and

347
00:21:23.451 --> 00:21:24.020
for all.

348
00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:28.100
That's the goal of this organization and this organization will stay active

349
00:21:28.101 --> 00:21:29.450
until that happens.

350
00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:33.880
Is this a situation where like with a ut you, uh,

351
00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:37.640
actively recruited plaintiffs? Yes, it is. It is.

352
00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:42.260
So I did with students for fair admissions,

353
00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:45.980
what I did with the University of Texas,

354
00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:51.550
and that is I'm working with friends and allies,

355
00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:57.110
uh, who yearn for the day that race and ethnicity is not a part of university

356
00:21:57.111 --> 00:22:01.250
admissions set up three new websites, Harvard,

357
00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.590
not fair.org,

358
00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:06.980
u n c not fair. Dot.

359
00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:10.310
O R G and u w not

360
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:14.090
fair.org w being Wisconsin.

361
00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:19.930
So it was our hope to find students who had been rejected from those three

362
00:22:20.031 --> 00:22:20.750
schools,

363
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:25.750
willing to join students for fair admissions and let us proceed into federal

364
00:22:26.121 --> 00:22:29.720
court. And that's, that's what we did. Ed Tell me,

365
00:22:29.721 --> 00:22:34.190
he got hundreds of responses to these websites from students who felt like

366
00:22:34.191 --> 00:22:35.390
they'd been discriminated against.

367
00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:38.990
He went out it down to just the students he felt had the most merit.

368
00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:41.810
I talked to the kids, I talked to their parents,

369
00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:47.290
each of those kids and their parents who agreed to join and participate as sort

370
00:22:49.911 --> 00:22:52.220
of a participating member in a lawsuit.

371
00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:56.450
I got on a plane and went to visit with them,

372
00:22:56.930 --> 00:23:00.830
learned about their background, let them ask me questions. And who are they?

373
00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:03.950
Well, can you tell me about them? Well, for the Harvard case,

374
00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:06.590
they are all Asian. Um,

375
00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:11.330
many of them are uh, children of immigrant,

376
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.950
uh,

377
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:17.950
Chinese children of first generation Korean and Vietnamese and they have

378
00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:21.560
relative academic records.

379
00:23:21.561 --> 00:23:26.390
I mean just startlingly so perfect GPA, A's,

380
00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:31.010
perfect sats and HTTS active in sports,

381
00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:35.280
lots of volunteer efforts. And how many, how many of them are, uh,

382
00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:36.770
directly associated with the case.

383
00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:43.690
That is something that the judge in the Harvard case has placed under seal,

384
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:47.270
uh, wisely. And why? And I think, ah,

385
00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:51.530
well we remember what happened with the,

386
00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:55.970
the harassment of Abigail Fisher.

387
00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:58.730
If you don't take your last on somewhere,

388
00:23:58.731 --> 00:24:01.380
maybe if her grades didn't suck your dumb ass,

389
00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:03.860
maybe you would've gotten into a good college.

390
00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:06.400
<v 10>Becky, with the bad grades, really happy,</v>

391
00:24:06.401 --> 00:24:08.140
you and your racist lawyer got shot down.

392
00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:10.480
<v 1>Abby was hounded.</v>

393
00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:14.380
Abby was threatened. Um,

394
00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:18.610
we learned an important lesson and that is,

395
00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:24.240
although there may be students who are brave enough to put their name on a

396
00:24:25.181 --> 00:24:25.990
lawsuit,

397
00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:30.940
the consequences can be dangerous and frightening.

398
00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:36.070
So all of the students involved in those three cases, Harvard,

399
00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:37.270
UNC,

400
00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:42.600
and the University of Texas have standing as members of the organization and

401
00:24:44.801 --> 00:24:47.440
their names, their addresses,

402
00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:51.160
their email will never be made to the public. It's a, I mean,

403
00:24:51.161 --> 00:24:55.390
it's a funny thing though because I mean, the idea of a plaintiff,

404
00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.790
even if it is often, uh,

405
00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:01.940
in a way a theatrical construct, it,

406
00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:06.970
it's strange to have plaintiffs that you can't examine and that you can't say,

407
00:25:06.971 --> 00:25:09.700
okay, well who are these people? Exactly. What are their circumstances?

408
00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:12.040
And you're right, Abigail Fisher,

409
00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:16.870
I think was the subject of some very hurtful kind of harassment at the same

410
00:25:16.871 --> 00:25:18.040
time, who she was,

411
00:25:18.041 --> 00:25:21.550
was a helpful starting point for the conversation about whether this should

412
00:25:21.551 --> 00:25:23.050
exist. I mean,

413
00:25:23.051 --> 00:25:26.050
affirmative action or whatever you would call this doesn't happen in the court.

414
00:25:26.051 --> 00:25:27.970
It happens in the world that happens in society.

415
00:25:27.971 --> 00:25:30.130
And this is something that affects all of us. Well,

416
00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:34.840
th th th this is very common in federal lawsuits in the ACL,

417
00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:39.990
which is a membership organization often sues in the name of the organization

418
00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:43.690
disclosing only to the courts.

419
00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:46.000
There are members who have been directly harmed by this.

420
00:25:46.001 --> 00:25:50.260
So what we're doing is not unusual. Gotcha. Okay.

421
00:25:50.261 --> 00:25:54.640
So you've said in interviews on this lawsuit that Asian American students are

422
00:25:54.641 --> 00:25:58.340
being penalized for being a high achieving minority. How do you argue that,

423
00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:01.510
that they're being penalized? Well, in litigation like this,

424
00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:06.160
we know that the court allows the use of race and ethnicity and admissions.

425
00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:11.600
What we also know is that you cannot as a university have too heavy of a hand

426
00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:18.160
using race and ethnicity. And furthermore,

427
00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:22.840
numeric quotas are completely forbidden.

428
00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:28.380
And how we show that Asians are being targeted in the Harvard case is to look at

429
00:26:28.631 --> 00:26:33.631
the number of Asians that have applied to Harvard and what percentage year after

430
00:26:34.541 --> 00:26:37.930
year after year has Harvard admitted.

431
00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:43.380
And what we found is that from 1992 through two and 13,

432
00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:45.870
um,

433
00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:50.870
the percentage of Asians that Harvard admits has been remarkably flat.

434
00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:55.620
In fact, in 1992,

435
00:26:55.800 --> 00:27:00.800
19% of Harvard's freshman class was Asian.

436
00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:05.520
Wow. In 2013,

437
00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:08.700
18% were Asian.

438
00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:14.060
Now that doesn't mean much until you realize that the number of Asians applying

439
00:27:15.181 --> 00:27:19.650
to Harvard during this period of time better than doubled.

440
00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:20.990
Just a quick note here, uh,

441
00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:25.140
Harvard hasn't actually released data on ethnicity and admissions for the years

442
00:27:25.141 --> 00:27:27.780
he was talking about. So we can't confirm the numbers he just use.

443
00:27:27.781 --> 00:27:32.781
We know that Ed Blum was drawing in part from the National Center for Education

444
00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.870
Statistics, which is a government organization. And by the way,

445
00:27:36.871 --> 00:27:39.570
when he says 19% of the freshman class,

446
00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:43.680
it turns out the number he was using refers to more than just freshmen.

447
00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:49.470
If those kinds of data points were presented in court,

448
00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:54.900
in an employment lawsuit against a major corporation like Walmart,

449
00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:59.640
Walmart would lose. Any judge would look at that and say,

450
00:27:59.641 --> 00:28:02.010
you've got a quota. Walmart,

451
00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:07.050
your employment practices fall afoul of title seven. Well,

452
00:28:07.051 --> 00:28:10.760
let me just push back against that for a second. Um, you know, the, the,

453
00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:14.520
that idea that you're expressing and the, and the sort of the fight, uh,

454
00:28:14.521 --> 00:28:14.941
the sort of,

455
00:28:14.941 --> 00:28:18.100
the spirit of the lawsuit is premised on this idea that if you take away race

456
00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:20.190
based filtering in admissions,

457
00:28:20.191 --> 00:28:23.550
that w what we would have as a more meritocratic system that's based purely on

458
00:28:23.551 --> 00:28:28.350
grades. But I mean, hasn't the meritocracy,

459
00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:32.160
isn't that just a myth? I mean, especially at a place like Harvard. I mean,

460
00:28:32.161 --> 00:28:33.600
if you look at the data at Harvard,

461
00:28:33.601 --> 00:28:36.030
you see the people whose parents went to Harvard,

462
00:28:36.031 --> 00:28:37.470
who have family members who went to Harvard,

463
00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:40.860
they get preferential treatment in the admissions process.

464
00:28:40.861 --> 00:28:43.140
And if you take that out just a few rungs, okay.

465
00:28:43.141 --> 00:28:47.970
People who have families that can afford to send them to Kaplan prep courses for

466
00:28:47.971 --> 00:28:50.910
the standardized tests, will they get a better leg up?

467
00:28:50.911 --> 00:28:53.640
And isn't that just kind of affirmative action for white people?

468
00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:56.130
So there's two ways I want to answer that question.

469
00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:00.450
The first is that it is not up to me,

470
00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:03.240
it is not up to this organization, uh,

471
00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:08.750
to dictate how Harvard or Texas or the University of North Carolina fashion

472
00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:12.150
their admissions policy.

473
00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:17.540
The only thing legally that we are advocating for is the end of racial

474
00:29:19.471 --> 00:29:23.490
distinctions in the admissions process. Number two,

475
00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:29.150
I agree that colleges and universities cannot use just strictly grades and sat

476
00:29:32.671 --> 00:29:35.100
scores as an admissions criteria.

477
00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:40.490
I believe legacy preferences should have been ended at Harvard and throughout

478
00:29:40.651 --> 00:29:42.820
the country decades ago.

479
00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:48.400
I think people who write big checks to universities whose children then get a

480
00:29:48.401 --> 00:29:51.940
leg up in the admissions process. I think that ought to end.

481
00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:57.270
I think the colleges and universities have an obligation to reach out to kids

482
00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:00.160
from disadvantaged backgrounds.

483
00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:05.470
Kids whose family income is small and below average,

484
00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:07.570
whose parents didn't go to college,

485
00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:11.380
who maybe grew up in a tough neighborhood.

486
00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:16.920
Colleges should use that and not race if they're going to give a leg up in

487
00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:22.510
helping kids from these disadvantaged backgrounds,

488
00:30:22.511 --> 00:30:26.200
and that means that there will be lots of African American kids,

489
00:30:26.201 --> 00:30:27.280
lots of Hispanics,

490
00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:32.110
but also lots of Asians and lots of white kids that get,

491
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:35.890
you know, a helping hand from Harvard and Princeton and Yale and Stanford.

492
00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:41.020
There is no reason why an Asian applicant to Harvard,

493
00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:44.140
whose parents are laborers.

494
00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:49.770
Mom works as a maid at a hotel in New York and dad works as a kitchen worker at

495
00:30:51.611 --> 00:30:52.750
a Chinese restaurant.

496
00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:56.680
There is no reason why that kid should be penalized.

497
00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:58.720
And White Kids,

498
00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:02.740
African American kids and Hispanic kids who come from professional backgrounds

499
00:31:02.741 --> 00:31:07.741
should be elevated ending racial classifications and preferences and instead

500
00:31:08.141 --> 00:31:13.141
substituting socioeconomic preferences is something that both the left and the

501
00:31:13.631 --> 00:31:14.830
right can agree on.

502
00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:19.570
But it's interesting to think about what might happen in the transitional space

503
00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:25.200
between say an ED balloon victory and that remedied admission system.

504
00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:27.370
Cause I was just thinking I might.

505
00:31:27.371 --> 00:31:31.390
Okay so take someone like Abigail Fisher and let's hold her in the right side of

506
00:31:31.391 --> 00:31:32.740
our mind and the left side of our mind.

507
00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:38.010
Let's say you get the Harvard case to Scotus and you win and the court agrees

508
00:31:39.401 --> 00:31:43.570
that there is some kind of quota in place and they no longer support that there

509
00:31:43.571 --> 00:31:47.590
should not be any kind of limit on high how many high achieving Asian American

510
00:31:47.591 --> 00:31:50.080
students get into Harvard or any university.

511
00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:55.240
It's interesting to think of the effect that might have on white applicants like

512
00:31:55.780 --> 00:32:00.070
Abigail Fisher. Well we make this argument in our lawsuit.

513
00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:03.580
The argument is that African Americans,

514
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000
Hispanics and whites are getting a preference over better qualified Asian

515
00:32:12.011 --> 00:32:14.410
applicants. So it is very likely.

516
00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:17.920
And what interesting is Andy Whites, so you leave you.

517
00:32:17.921 --> 00:32:20.440
We asserted that in our lawsuit,

518
00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:25.390
so this is not an attempt to, I don't know,

519
00:32:25.391 --> 00:32:26.590
reinvigorate,

520
00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:31.680
protect white applicants at all of the Ivy League and schools like Duke and

521
00:32:32.171 --> 00:32:34.480
Stanford outside of the Ivy League. Well,

522
00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:36.850
the number of whites is likely to go down.

523
00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:40.320
The number of Asians is likely to go up. That's,

524
00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:45.110
that's why we don't have any whites as plaintiffs in our Harvard lawsuit.

525
00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:50.630
That's why none of the kids that join students for fair admissions to challenge

526
00:32:50.631 --> 00:32:55.631
Harvard we're white is because they're benefiting from the discrimination that

527
00:32:56.751 --> 00:32:58.360
Asians are suffering there.

528
00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:04.130
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

529
00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:05.180
<v 0>that's Edward Bloom.</v>

530
00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:11.630
Harvard sent us a statement which didn't directly respond to Ed Blum specific

531
00:33:11.631 --> 00:33:12.231
allegations,

532
00:33:12.231 --> 00:33:16.280
but they did say that they do make an effort to create diversity in their

533
00:33:16.281 --> 00:33:21.170
student body because when a student encounters diverse types of people with

534
00:33:21.171 --> 00:33:22.010
diverse experiences,

535
00:33:22.011 --> 00:33:26.870
that student grows and you can read their full statement on our website,

536
00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:30.020
but we'll also have some additional information about the lawsuits we talked

537
00:33:30.021 --> 00:33:32.870
about, which again are in the early stages. That's it.
