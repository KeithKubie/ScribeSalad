00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.080
Will lower tax lead to higher growth for lower
growth?

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.710
You know, it really depends what's the level
of tax you start from in what country and

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.500
it really depends what you do with your tax
revenue.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.359
In Europe it's interesting because we have
28 different countries in the European Union

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:18.949
with very different level of taxation.

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:24.970
Now the countries with the lowest tax level,
countries like Bulgaria or Romania where the

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:32.000
total tax revenue is 20 or 30 percent GDP,
whereas the richest countries like Sweden

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.120
or Denmark have 50 percent of GDP in tax revenue.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.620
So if it was enough to have low tax in order
to be rich then Bulgaria and Romania would

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.370
be richer than Sweden and Denmark and apparently
this is not working this way.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:53.440
Probably because what Sweden and Denmark do
with their high tax revenue is to invest them

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.989
in education, in public infrastructure.

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.260
So if you do useful things with your tax revenue,
in fact it can be very good for growth and

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.350
you need public infrastructure, you need public
investment in education in order to grow.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.310
Now of course, if you don't to do all these
good things with your tax revenue then higher

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.360
taxes can certainly be bad for growth.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.780
So it all depends what you do with your tax.
