00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:01.570
- [Instructor] In a previous
video we started thinking

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:04.370
about strategies for dividing numbers

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.098
where either the numbers are decimals,

00:00:06.098 --> 00:00:09.090
or their quotients are
going to be decimals.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.306
So now let's continue that,

00:00:10.306 --> 00:00:13.155
and we're gonna do a slightly
more involved examples.

00:00:13.155 --> 00:00:17.322
So let's say we wanna figure
out what 500 divided by 200 is.

00:00:19.794 --> 00:00:21.377
Divided by 200.

00:00:21.377 --> 00:00:25.545
Pause this video and see
if you can figure that out.

00:00:25.545 --> 00:00:28.313
Well, one strategy for doing this is

00:00:28.313 --> 00:00:30.425
to just re-express this as a fraction

00:00:30.425 --> 00:00:32.849
and see if you can simplify
this fraction in a way

00:00:32.849 --> 00:00:35.570
that it's straightforward
to express it as a decimal.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.457
So for example, this is
going to be the same thing.

00:00:38.457 --> 00:00:40.207
This is equal to 500,

00:00:42.045 --> 00:00:43.128
500 over 200.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.757
And now we can simplify this.

00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:53.176
We can say this is the same
thing as five times 100,

00:00:53.176 --> 00:00:54.426
five times 100,

00:00:55.584 --> 00:00:57.912
over two times 100.

00:00:57.912 --> 00:00:59.663
The reason why that is useful is you say,

00:00:59.663 --> 00:01:01.607
"Hey look, I have a
hundred in the numerator,

00:01:01.607 --> 00:01:03.079
"I have a hundred in the denominator,

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.511
"a hundred divided by a hundred
is just going to be one."

00:01:06.511 --> 00:01:08.544
So, you could just do this.

00:01:08.544 --> 00:01:10.961
This is equal to five halves.

00:01:12.268 --> 00:01:13.768
Five halves times.

00:01:16.896 --> 00:01:18.479
Times 100 over 100.

00:01:20.982 --> 00:01:22.565
Times 100 over 100.

00:01:24.206 --> 00:01:26.774
Which is just going to be equal to,

00:01:26.774 --> 00:01:28.567
which is just going to be equal to one.

00:01:28.567 --> 00:01:29.575
Another way to think about it,

00:01:29.575 --> 00:01:32.481
you could divide the
numerator by a hundred.

00:01:32.481 --> 00:01:33.823
And you would have five,

00:01:33.823 --> 00:01:36.073
and as long as you divide the
denominator by the same thing,

00:01:36.073 --> 00:01:38.703
you're not changing the
value of the fraction.

00:01:38.703 --> 00:01:40.687
So if you divide the
denominator by a hundred,

00:01:40.687 --> 00:01:42.063
you're going to get two.

00:01:42.063 --> 00:01:43.391
So, any way you think about it,

00:01:43.391 --> 00:01:45.983
this could be simplified as five halves.

00:01:45.983 --> 00:01:47.223
But we're not done yet.

00:01:47.223 --> 00:01:50.199
That is what 500 divided by 200 is.

00:01:50.199 --> 00:01:52.919
But can we express this as a decimal?

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:56.615
Well we can rewrite five
halves as a mixed number.

00:01:56.615 --> 00:01:59.865
So five halves is going to be equal to,

00:02:01.199 --> 00:02:03.415
well how many times does two go into five?

00:02:03.415 --> 00:02:05.255
Well it goes two times,

00:02:05.255 --> 00:02:08.167
and then you have one half left over.

00:02:08.167 --> 00:02:11.500
So this is going to be two and one half.

00:02:14.166 --> 00:02:17.894
And now how do we express this
right over here as a decimal?

00:02:17.894 --> 00:02:19.573
Well, you might recognize that one half

00:02:19.573 --> 00:02:21.917
is the same thing as five tenths.

00:02:21.917 --> 00:02:26.084
So this is going to be equal
to two and five over ten,

00:02:29.204 --> 00:02:32.204
which of course we can write as 2.5,

00:02:33.386 --> 00:02:35.748
or two and five tenths.

00:02:35.748 --> 00:02:38.165
So 500 divided by 200 is 2.5.

00:02:40.134 --> 00:02:42.030
Let's do another example.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.622
Let's say we wanted to figure out

00:02:44.622 --> 00:02:47.039
what 0.63 divided by 0.07 is.

00:02:56.249 --> 00:02:57.497
Pause this video and
see if you can come up

00:02:57.497 --> 00:03:00.080
with a strategy for doing this.

00:03:01.535 --> 00:03:04.056
Well there's multiple ways to tackle it.

00:03:04.056 --> 00:03:06.407
One way is to think about both of them

00:03:06.407 --> 00:03:07.865
in terms of hundredths.

00:03:07.865 --> 00:03:11.032
So for example, this is 63 hundredths.

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:18.149
And this right over here
is seven hundredths.

00:03:20.751 --> 00:03:22.519
And so if you have 63 of something,

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.269
and you're dividing that
by seven hundredths,

00:03:28.534 --> 00:03:31.126
what are you going to get?

00:03:31.126 --> 00:03:35.293
Well, you're going to, if you
took your seven hundredths,

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.600
and you multiply it by nine,

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.240
you're going to get 63 hundredths.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.154
And so 63 of something divided by seven

00:03:44.154 --> 00:03:47.432
of that same something is
going to be equal to nine.

00:03:47.432 --> 00:03:50.265
This is going to be equal to nine.

00:03:51.661 --> 00:03:54.141
Seven times nine is 63.

00:03:54.141 --> 00:03:58.308
So seven hundredths times nine
is going to be 63 hundredths.

00:04:00.324 --> 00:04:01.951
Another way to think about it

00:04:01.951 --> 00:04:04.732
is we can express this as a fraction.

00:04:04.732 --> 00:04:07.884
So in the numerator, you have 0.63

00:04:07.884 --> 00:04:11.051
and in the denominator, you have 0.07.

00:04:12.607 --> 00:04:14.535
And if the decimals are bothering us,

00:04:14.535 --> 00:04:16.583
we can multiply both the
numerator and the denominator

00:04:16.583 --> 00:04:19.407
by the same value to
get rid of the decimals.

00:04:19.407 --> 00:04:22.495
So let's multiply the numerator by 100,

00:04:22.495 --> 00:04:25.948
and also multiply the denominator by 100.

00:04:25.948 --> 00:04:27.532
This doesn't change the
value of the expression

00:04:27.532 --> 00:04:29.788
because multiplying by 100
over 100 is just the same thing

00:04:29.788 --> 00:04:31.636
as multiplying by one.

00:04:31.636 --> 00:04:35.803
So this would be equal to
63 hundredths times 100.

00:04:36.807 --> 00:04:39.160
Well we would move the
decimal two to the right.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.183
This is going to be equal

00:04:40.183 --> 00:04:43.350
to 63 over seven hundredths times 100.

00:04:46.385 --> 00:04:49.819
Once again we move the
decimal two to the right.

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:51.898
This is going to be seven.

00:04:51.898 --> 00:04:54.815
So 63 divided by seven, once again,

00:04:55.963 --> 00:04:58.796
that is going to be equal to nine.
