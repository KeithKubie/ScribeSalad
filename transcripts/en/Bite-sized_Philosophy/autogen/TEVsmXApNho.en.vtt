now this the baboon here who's supposed

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970
now this the baboon here who's supposed
 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.640
now this the baboon here who's supposed
to be basically just a fool when the

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650
to be basically just a fool when the
 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.260
to be basically just a fool when the
story was first written he turned into

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270
story was first written he turned into
 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.299
story was first written he turned into
what's essentially a shaman across time

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309
what's essentially a shaman across time
 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.540
what's essentially a shaman across time
and so he represents the self from the

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550
and so he represents the self from the
 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.370
and so he represents the self from the
Union perspective now the self is

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380
Union perspective now the self is
 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.829
Union perspective now the self is
everything you could be across time so

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839
everything you could be across time so
 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.510
everything you could be across time so
you imagine that there's you and there's

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520
you imagine that there's you and there's
 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.460
you imagine that there's you and there's
the potential inside you whatever that

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470
the potential inside you whatever that
 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.529
the potential inside you whatever that
is you know and potential is an

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539
is you know and potential is an
 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.630
is you know and potential is an
interesting idea because it represents

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640
interesting idea because it represents
 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.970
interesting idea because it represents
something that isn't yet real yet we act

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980
something that isn't yet real yet we act
 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.800
something that isn't yet real yet we act
like it's real because people will say

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810
like it's real because people will say
 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:28.970
like it's real because people will say
to you you should live up to your

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980
to you you should live up to your
 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.370
to you you should live up to your
potential and that potential is partly

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380
potential and that potential is partly
 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.740
potential and that potential is partly
what you could be if you interacted with

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750
what you could be if you interacted with
 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.900
what you could be if you interacted with
the world in a manner that would gain

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910
the world in a manner that would gain
 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.299
the world in a manner that would gain
you the most information right because

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309
you the most information right because
 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.470
you the most information right because
you build yourself out of the

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480
you build yourself out of the
 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.630
you build yourself out of the
information in the piagetian sense but

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640
information in the piagetian sense but
 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.250
information in the piagetian sense but
it's deeper than that too because we

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260
it's deeper than that too because we
 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.779
it's deeper than that too because we
know that if you take yourself and you

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789
know that if you take yourself and you
 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.400
know that if you take yourself and you
put yourself in a new environment new

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410
put yourself in a new environment new
 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.470
put yourself in a new environment new
jeans turn on in your nervous system

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480
jeans turn on in your nervous system
 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.660
jeans turn on in your nervous system
they encode for new proteins and so

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670
they encode for new proteins and so
 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.450
they encode for new proteins and so
you're full of biological potential that

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460
you're full of biological potential that
 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.010
you're full of biological potential that
won't be realized unless you move

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020
won't be realized unless you move
 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.380
won't be realized unless you move
yourself around in the world in two

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390
yourself around in the world in two
 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.240
yourself around in the world in two
different challenging circumstances and

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250
different challenging circumstances and
 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.250
different challenging circumstances and
that'll turn on different circuits so

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260
that'll turn on different circuits so
 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.209
that'll turn on different circuits so
it's not merely that you're

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219
it's not merely that you're
 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.740
it's not merely that you're
incorporating information from the

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750
incorporating information from the
 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.299
incorporating information from the
outside world in the constructivist

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309
outside world in the constructivist
 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.789
outside world in the constructivist
sense it's that by exposing yourself to

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799
sense it's that by exposing yourself to
 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.100
sense it's that by exposing yourself to
different environments you put different

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110
different environments you put different
 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.230
different environments you put different
physiological demands on on yourself all

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240
physiological demands on on yourself all
 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.300
physiological demands on on yourself all
the way down to the genetic level and

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310
the way down to the genetic level and
 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.240
the way down to the genetic level and
that manifests new elements of you and

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250
that manifests new elements of you and
 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.130
that manifests new elements of you and
so one of the things that happens to

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140
so one of the things that happens to
 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.539
so one of the things that happens to
people and this is a very common

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549
people and this is a very common
 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.179
people and this is a very common
cultural notion is that you should go on

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189
cultural notion is that you should go on
 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.550
cultural notion is that you should go on
a pilgrimage at some point to somewhere

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560
a pilgrimage at some point to somewhere
 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.440
a pilgrimage at some point to somewhere
central and that would be say like the

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450
central and that would be say like the
 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.840
central and that would be say like the
rock in the Pride Rock and the Lion King

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850
rock in the Pride Rock and the Lion King
 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.370
rock in the Pride Rock and the Lion King
because you take yourself out of your

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380
because you take yourself out of your
 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.380
because you take yourself out of your
dopey little village and that's just a

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390
dopey little village and that's just a
 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.179
dopey little village and that's just a
little bounded you that everyone knows

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189
little bounded you that everyone knows
 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.190
little bounded you that everyone knows
and that isn't very expanded and then

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200
and that isn't very expanded and then
 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.319
and that isn't very expanded and then
you go somewhere dark and dangerous to

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329
you go somewhere dark and dangerous to
 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.149
you go somewhere dark and dangerous to
the central place and while you do that

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159
the central place and while you do that
 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.100
the central place and while you do that
you have adventures and they toughen you

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110
you have adventures and they toughen you
 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.830
you have adventures and they toughen you
and pull more out of you like partly

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840
and pull more out of you like partly
 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.289
and pull more out of you like partly
because you're becoming informed which

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299
because you're becoming informed which
 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.899
because you're becoming informed which
means in formation it means you're

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909
means in formation it means you're
 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.730
means in formation it means you're
becoming more organized at every level

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740
becoming more organized at every level
 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.590
becoming more organized at every level
of analysis but there's also more of you

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600
of analysis but there's also more of you
 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.020
of analysis but there's also more of you
too and so that's a very classic idea

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030
too and so that's a very classic idea
 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.670
too and so that's a very classic idea
and then in in cathedrals in Europe

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680
and then in in cathedrals in Europe
 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.679
and then in in cathedrals in Europe
especially at Chartres there's a big

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689
especially at Chartres there's a big
 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.050
especially at Chartres there's a big
maze on the floor a circular maze which

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060
maze on the floor a circular maze which
 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.060
maze on the floor a circular maze which
is a symbolic representation of the

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070
is a symbolic representation of the
 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.800
is a symbolic representation of the
pilgrimage for people who couldn't do it

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810
pilgrimage for people who couldn't do it
 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.169
pilgrimage for people who couldn't do it
and so it's a huge circle divided into

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179
and so it's a huge circle divided into
 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.270
and so it's a huge circle divided into
quadrants which is a union Mandela and

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280
quadrants which is a union Mandela and
 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.820
quadrants which is a union Mandela and
you enter the maze at one point

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830
you enter the maze at one point
 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:14.870
you enter the maze at one point
then you have to walk through the entire

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880
then you have to walk through the entire
 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.230
then you have to walk through the entire
maze north east west and south before

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240
maze north east west and south before
 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.480
maze north east west and south before
you get to the center and the center is

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490
you get to the center and the center is
 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.790
you get to the center and the center is
symbolized by a flower that's carved in

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800
symbolized by a flower that's carved in
 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.680
symbolized by a flower that's carved in
stone it looks like this it's big this

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690
stone it looks like this it's big this
 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.170
stone it looks like this it's big this
maze a it's it's large so that you can

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180
maze a it's it's large so that you can
 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.510
maze a it's it's large so that you can
walk it and that's a symbolic pilgrimage

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520
walk it and that's a symbolic pilgrimage
 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.340
walk it and that's a symbolic pilgrimage
it takes you to the center that's the

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350
it takes you to the center that's the
 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.110
it takes you to the center that's the
center of the cross because it's in a

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120
center of the cross because it's in a
 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.720
center of the cross because it's in a
Cathedral and that's the point of

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730
Cathedral and that's the point of
 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.220
Cathedral and that's the point of
acceptance of voluntary suffering that's

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230
acceptance of voluntary suffering that's
 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.890
acceptance of voluntary suffering that's
what that means and so you walk through

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900
what that means and so you walk through
 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.620
what that means and so you walk through
you call that a circumambulation you go

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630
you call that a circumambulation you go
 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.570
you call that a circumambulation you go
to all the quarters of the world to find

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580
to all the quarters of the world to find
 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.740
to all the quarters of the world to find
yourself and so well the self is the

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750
yourself and so well the self is the
 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.170
yourself and so well the self is the
baboon in this particular in this piece

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180
baboon in this particular in this piece
 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.390
baboon in this particular in this piece
of mandrill actually in this particular

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400
of mandrill actually in this particular
 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.220
of mandrill actually in this particular
representation and he lives in the tree

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230
representation and he lives in the tree
 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.260
representation and he lives in the tree
he lives in the tree of life it's a bale

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270
he lives in the tree of life it's a bale
 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.390
he lives in the tree of life it's a bale
bob tree in this particular so he's the

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400
bob tree in this particular so he's the
 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.100
bob tree in this particular so he's the
spirit that inhabits the Tree of Life

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110
spirit that inhabits the Tree of Life
 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.550
spirit that inhabits the Tree of Life
and he's the eternal wise man that's a

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560
and he's the eternal wise man that's a
 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.470
and he's the eternal wise man that's a
way of thinking so is the king but that

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480
way of thinking so is the king but that
 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.270
way of thinking so is the king but that
he's he's sort of a superordinate king

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280
he's he's sort of a superordinate king
 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.460
he's he's sort of a superordinate king
or an outside king in some sense he's

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470
or an outside king in some sense he's
 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.100

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.810
the repository of ancient wisdom and the
king is the manner in which that wisdom

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820
king is the manner in which that wisdom
 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.250

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120
world and so they're friends and that
 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.000

and that would make him shallow and
 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.370
and that would make him shallow and
one-dimensional and that would make him

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380
one-dimensional and that would make him
 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.680
one-dimensional and that would make him
a bad ruler no Union with the traditions

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690
a bad ruler no Union with the traditions
