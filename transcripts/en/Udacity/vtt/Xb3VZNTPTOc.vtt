00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Here is the answer--a 6, 0, and a 6.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The way the 6 is calculated is by a product.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We are in this position the 2 is the true answer with 1/3 chance.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
When 2 is the correct answer, he'll never pick 2,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
because he'll just show me that my guess is correct, so he'll pick 1 or 3.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Each of those he picks with half chance.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
As a result, for the joint of these two things to occur,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
you multiple 1/3 by 1/2 and get 1/6, and the same over here.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
This is the truth table for any combination of the true location and what Monty shows me,

00:00:30.000 --> 99:59:59.000
provided that I pick door number 2.
