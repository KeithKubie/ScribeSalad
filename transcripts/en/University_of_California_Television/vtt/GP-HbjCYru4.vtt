00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:03.610
- [Announcer] This
program is a presentation

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.823
of UCTV for educational and
non-commercial use only.

00:00:10.913 --> 00:00:13.496
(gentle music)

00:00:43.706 --> 00:00:44.811
- Good afternoon.

00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:46.850
- [Woman] Good afternoon.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.940
- I'm Andrew Szeri, Dean
of Graduate Division

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.714
and I'm pleased, along with
the Moses Lecture Committee

00:00:52.714 --> 00:00:55.760
to present Carolyn Merchant,
this year's speaker

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.670
in the Bernard Moses
Memorial Lecture Series.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.020
As a condition of this
bequest, we're obligated

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.770
to tell you how the endowments
supported the lectures,

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.053
supporting the lectures,
came to UC Berkeley.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.310
In 1937, University of California

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.070
President Robert Gordon Sprowl
and the UC Board of Regents

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.190
established the Bernard
Moses Memorial Lectureship

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.470
in the Social Sciences.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.910
The lectureship honors the
memory of the late Bernard Moses,

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.360
a professor of history
and of political science

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.360
at the University of
California from 1875 to 1911

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.443
and a emeritus professor from
1911 until his death in 1930.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.410
Professor Moses earned
a worldwide reputation

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.984
for his contributions in
understanding the problems

00:01:43.984 --> 00:01:48.700
of Latin American republics
and is a pioneer scholar.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.420
Professor Moses served as a member

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.163
of the United State Philippine
Commission from 1900 to 1904.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.000
Past lecturers in this series
have included Herma Hilkay,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.210
Llyod Ulman, Nicholas
Riasanovsky, George Lakoff,

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.003
Kenneth Stampp, Eugene
Hammel, and Ken Jowitt.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.770
And now I'd like to
invite Margaret Chowning,

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.610
Professor of History and chair

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.150
of the Moses Memorial Lecture Committee

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.900
to introduce today's
lecturer, Carolyn Merchant.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:20.733
Thank you.

00:02:22.334 --> 00:02:25.334
(audience applauds)

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.740
- Thank you.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.623
Carolyn, I don't want to
touch your computer here, so.

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.320
Professor Carolyn Merchant
is a renown historian

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.270
of many things.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.700
Of science, of the environment,
of scientific culture,

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.040
of economic change, and of women.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.596
Her path-breaking book
The Death of Nature:

00:02:54.596 --> 00:02:58.610
Women, Ecology, and the
Scientific Revolution

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.750
which was published in 1980
led to her being called

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.000
an eco-feminist philosopher,
which is a label

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.580
I think is quite astounding
for a historian to earn,

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.670
because of the rich and complex argument

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.140
about the ways that
the modern exploitation

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.890
of nature subordinated women.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.688
In addition to the Death of Nature,

00:03:20.688 --> 00:03:23.700
Carolyn Merchant has
authored numerous books

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.170
including Ecological
Revolutions: Nature, Gender,

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.390
and Science in New England in 1989,

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.160
Radical Ecology: The Search
for a Livable World in 1992,

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.878
Earth Care: Women and
the Environment in 1996,

00:03:38.878 --> 00:03:41.791
The Columbia Guide to
American Environmental History

00:03:41.791 --> 00:03:46.729
and Reinventing Eden: The Fate
of Nature in Western Culture

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:51.160
in 2003, as well as many articles

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.660
on the history of science,
environmental history,

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.890
the women in the environment.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.770
Carolyn Merchant received
her B.A. from Vassar College

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.580
and her PhD in the history of science

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.300
from the University of
Wisconsin at Madison.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.379
She is a professor of
environmental history,

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:09.480
philosophy, and ethics here at Berkeley

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.060
where she has been a member of the faculty

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.290
for the past three decades.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.210
Merchant's lecture today will
focus on humanity's shift

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:19.154
from the ethic of control of nature

00:04:19.154 --> 00:04:22.640
to one of partnership
with the natural world.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.160
Since the scientific
revolution of the 17th century,

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.170
the long-term goal for the
betterment of humankind

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.077
was to understand science
and manage nature,

00:04:32.077 --> 00:04:35.330
but in the 21st century,
this has given way

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.720
to environmental awareness
and the formation

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.410
of a viable, sustainable relationship

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.010
in which connections to the
global world are recognized

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.480
through science, technology,
and ecological exchanges.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.716
On that optimistic note, let
me introduce Carolyn Merchant.

00:04:52.716 --> 00:04:55.716
(audience applauds)

00:05:00.057 --> 00:05:04.280
- Thank you very much for
those wonderful introductions

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.890
and for inviting me to give this lecture.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.861
I'm just delighted to be
here and to see all of you.

00:05:11.861 --> 00:05:16.861
Today, what I want to talk
about is the transformation

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.326
from the period prior to
the scientific revolution

00:05:23.326 --> 00:05:28.040
of the 16th and 17th
century when basically,

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.330
people had to play the
hand that nature dealt

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.020
and did not have very much
or very low level capacity

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.100
for the control and management of nature.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:45.100
During the scientific
revolution of the 17th century,

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.508
and by that I mean the period basically

00:05:47.508 --> 00:05:52.230
from Copernicus in the
mid 16th century to Newton

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.460
at the end of the 17th century.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.910
A transformation came about
in which the possibilities

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:04.310
for the contained, controlled experiment

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.310
and therefore, the control
of nature and the management

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:13.620
of the environment became possible.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:18.620
That philosophy of nature
has remained with us

00:06:20.052 --> 00:06:24.000
and is still with us to the present day,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.580
but I want to outline what I
think are new possibilities

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.223
for a new ethic for the
future and that is what I call

00:06:32.223 --> 00:06:34.353
a partnership ethic.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.600
We can talk about an era
before environmentalism

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.940
and that would be the period at the end

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:51.940
of the medieval era and the beginnings

00:06:52.763 --> 00:06:56.010
of the explorations of the New World,

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:59.770
the rise of nation states, in particular,

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:04.770
the emphasis that now became possible

00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:08.350
on mining the earth for metals,

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:13.350
especially for iron and for
coal and for other metals

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:19.520
that would make the nation
states of Europe strong

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:23.473
and have power and be able
to vibe with each other.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:29.500
The process of mining
and also of the extension

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.430
of trades, such as the wool trade,

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:39.430
meant that European forests
all over the continent

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:44.900
and especially in England,
were being depleted of trees.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:48.830
Forests were being cut
down, marshes were drained,

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:52.823
and much of the land was
being converted to pasture.

00:07:54.216 --> 00:07:59.100
As this very early phase
of industrialization

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:04.100
began to spread and began to increase,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:09.260
we had a change from the worldview

00:08:10.379 --> 00:08:15.379
of nature as a living
organism and an economy

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:21.540
based on human labor, animal
labor, wind, and water.

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:28.750
In other words, organic forces of nature

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:33.120
to one that was based on
the metals and on coal

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:37.363
and non-renewable
inorganic energy sources.

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:43.570
During the process of this
immense transformation in Europe,

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:48.570
the capability through
science and technology

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:52.520
to dominate and control the environment

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:57.450
became more and more feasible
and it's during this period

00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:02.450
when we have the two-sided
development of science

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:08.620
and technology, that is,
the rise of experimentation

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:12.970
and the rise of a
mathematical understanding

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:17.970
of the world, the ability
to derive mathematical laws

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:22.400
that described first the heavens and then

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:26.693
the terrestrial lands, and
then as we move forward,

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:32.560
eventually to hydrodynamics
and electricity

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:38.390
and magnetism, 19th century
thermodynamics, et cetera.

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:45.581
It is the experimental method
and the mathematical method

00:09:45.581 --> 00:09:50.581
that together, begin to
give people the sense

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:56.560
that they have the technology
and the understanding

00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:59.960
of the natural world.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.350
They are able, through experimentation,

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:07.310
to define a closed controlled space

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:10.870
and through mathematics, a closed system,

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:15.070
and therefore, to describe and
understand the natural world

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:20.070
which then gave them the
capacity for domination

00:10:20.553 --> 00:10:22.253
and control.

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:28.130
The Renaissance philosophy of nature

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:30.955
was one of a living organism.

00:10:30.955 --> 00:10:35.827
It was a projection of the
human body onto the cosmos.

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:40.490
The cosmos, like the human
being, had a body, soul,

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:41.870
and spirit.

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:45.580
The earth, also, was alive and the earth

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:49.550
was conceptualized as a nurturing mother

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:55.670
which had systems like the human being.

00:10:55.810 --> 00:11:00.810
A circulation, reproduction,
and even elimination systems.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:05.837
Earthquakes were said to
be the earth breaking wind.

00:11:05.837 --> 00:11:07.410
(audience laughs)

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:12.410
And the metals grew in the earth's womb

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:17.600
and once a mine was dug and
the metals dug out of it,

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:20.910
it was thought that the metals were alive

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:22.433
and would grow back.

00:11:23.818 --> 00:11:28.818
Nature was the servant of God, the deity,

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:34.260
carrying out God's will in the world below

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:39.260
and so in this picture we see
here by Athanasius Kircher

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:47.170
in his book, Mundus
Subterraneus, we see the interior

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:53.330
of the earth and is an
earth that looks alive,

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:58.330
as if it has wounds and
veins and circulatory devices

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.253
and elimination as well.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:10.280
Kircher went to, wrote
this book in conjunction

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:13.853
with a trip up Mount Vesuvius.

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:18.820
Plinny, the elder, had
been killed in the eruption

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:23.820
of Vesuvius in 79 C.E. and
Kircher wanted to understand

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:29.610
the interior of the earth
mother, and so he took

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:33.930
a journey down into the
interior of Mount Vesuvius.

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:37.800
I was in Naples about three
years ago and I decided

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.200
I'd like to follow in
the footsteps of Kircher

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.290
and so I commissioned
my friends to take me

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:49.290
up Mount Vesuvius and we
got as far as the road

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:54.490
that continued up to the
top, but it was closed.

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:59.070
Unfortunately, I had to be
satisfied with just seeing

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:00.453
the outside.

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:06.087
The other primary view
of nature in the 16th

00:13:06.087 --> 00:13:10.350
and 17th centuries was
the opposite of nature

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:15.330
as a nurturer or as a
mother, but rather nature

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:20.330
as the bringer of famine,
of disease, of hurricanes,

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:26.990
of drought, and therefore,
a more negative side

00:13:27.137 --> 00:13:32.137
of the aspect of nature as female.

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:39.180
Nature also was thought to,
in the interior of the earth,

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:45.520
in the interior of
nature, to harbor secrets,

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.380
and it's the extraction of those secrets

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:53.380
which were the goal of the
17th century scientists.

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:59.440
In some ways, this was nature
being put to the question.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:04.060
A question would be asked of
nature and then one would pry

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:08.710
into the inner workings of an organism

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:12.853
or of the earth itself to
try to answer that question.

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:19.690
It is the vision of Francis
Bacon to whom we owe

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:25.080
the idea that it would
be possible to extract

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:29.560
the secrets of nature through
science and technology,

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:31.083
through the arts.

00:14:32.737 --> 00:14:36.127
"Humans", Bacon said,
"should endeavor to establish

00:14:36.127 --> 00:14:40.505
"and extend the power and
dominion of the human race itself

00:14:40.505 --> 00:14:43.218
"over the universe."

00:14:43.218 --> 00:14:48.120
This is a major goal
of vision, which we owe

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:52.890
to Francis Bacon and which
inspired his followers

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:54.920
throughout the 17th century

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:58.203
and for several centuries beyond.

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:04.630
Bacon's idea was one of experimentation.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:10.360
How was one, through
experiment, going to reveal

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:14.330
the secrets of nature to everybody

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.620
for the good of humankind?

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:21.620
Up until this time, much
of this work was done

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:26.400
by alchemists and natural
magicians and astrologers

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:31.400
and those who believed that
they had their own idea

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:35.580
of how to extract the secrets.

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:38.593
Bacon wanted to make
this public knowledge.

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:45.780
In 1620, he wrote The Novum
Organum or The New Organon

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:52.900
which was a revision of Aristotle's work.

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:57.520
He called it, or it translates
as The New Instrument,

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:00.310
and basically it means
that the human being,

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:05.310
through hands and eyes and mind, can act

00:16:05.806 --> 00:16:08.923
as an instrument on nature.

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:14.820
Bacon's idea was that it
was important to recover

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:18.137
the lost Garden of Eden and he said, "man,

00:16:18.137 --> 00:16:22.760
"by the fall, fell from his
dominion over creation,"

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:26.305
but he argued that, through
science and technology,

00:16:26.305 --> 00:16:29.570
that is, what he called
the arts and science,

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:34.570
it was possible to repair
that loss and therefore,

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:39.760
to retain and regain the original garden.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:43.507
He said, "man can recover
that right over nature

00:16:43.507 --> 00:16:46.907
"which belongs to it by divine bequest."

00:16:48.081 --> 00:16:51.810
The goal of extracting
the secrets of nature

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:56.810
through technology meant
that because the earth

00:16:56.930 --> 00:17:01.170
was conceptualized as
a female or a mother,

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:06.170
that he used language such as the idea

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:11.320
that the secrets are still
locked in nature's bosom

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:15.010
and that the miners and
smiths were searching

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:20.010
into the bowels of nature,
again, organic imagery,

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:23.483
and shaping nature as on the anvil.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:31.400
The idea of the experiment
comes through Bacon

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:35.480
and it's developed in ever
greater sophistication

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:38.790
as we move through the 17th century,

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:43.790
but what I want to talk
about is Bacon's nascent idea

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.300
of experimentation.

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:50.300
He used the word experiment
and what he meant by it

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:53.883
was that we should ask
a question of nature.

00:17:55.292 --> 00:17:59.290
He did not have the full
idea of a contained,

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:02.276
controlled experiment or
what he would have called

00:18:02.276 --> 00:18:04.250
nature in bonds.

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.750
He said there were three states of nature.

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:10.960
Nature as free and at liberty to develop

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:15.410
all the animals and plants that
we find on the earth today,

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:20.410
nature in error meaning
nature who had gone astray

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.300
and somehow created
monstrosities that shouldn't

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:29.370
have been there, and then nature in bonds.

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:34.370
Nature in bonds, he
argued, was the control

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:42.540
of nature and the process
of using technology

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:45.890
to extract nature's secrets.

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:50.880
If we think about the rise
of the experimental method,

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:55.880
what Bacon is suggesting is
that we have a questioner,

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.948
or a scientist, we would later call them,

00:18:58.948 --> 00:19:03.948
or an inquisitor, who sets up the question

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:10.150
and dictates the conditions
for the procedure.

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:13.600
The objects, then, should be manipulated

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:18.130
in order to extract an
answer, and most importantly,

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:23.130
you need witnesses or
observers, in order to compare

00:19:24.141 --> 00:19:28.080
the observations of each of them.

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:32.510
Data need to be recorded and then it needs

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:36.170
to be repeated in other places and times.

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:38.330
Bacon wasn't there yet.

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:42.400
He did not put this procedure in the way

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.927
I have just done it, but he was,

00:19:44.927 --> 00:19:48.840
through vivid metaphor and language,

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:51.253
he was moving in that direction.

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:57.030
I wanna talk about three
settings out of which

00:19:57.030 --> 00:20:00.980
his concept of experiment
emerges and therefore,

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:04.240
the idea of the possibility of controlling

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:07.303
and therefore having dominion over nature.

00:20:08.409 --> 00:20:11.960
The first setting is the courtroom.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:16.960
Bacon was an attorney
general and the lord keeper

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:22.210
and ultimately, the lord
Verulam and Bacon rose up

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:25.513
through the court system.

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:30.580
He was the clerk of the
Star Chamber early on

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:35.580
in his career where
criminals were questioned

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:42.050
under very tightly controlled conditions.

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:49.370
The courtroom becomes
an example of this idea,

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:54.070
this nascent idea of the
contained, controlled experiment.

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:58.790
You have a room that is set in inside

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:05.270
where only the people who
are privileged are allowed

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:09.183
to enter, like the privileged scientist.

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:14.210
Those who have passed
the bar can move in front

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:18.750
of the bar and be allowed to be the judge

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:22.170
or the lawyers or the jury.

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:27.170
In this case, we see nature
on trial in these two images.

00:21:28.786 --> 00:21:33.786
We could think of the court
case as science V nature

00:21:34.893 --> 00:21:39.893
where you have a scientist,
an inquisitor or a judge,

00:21:40.441 --> 00:21:44.310
versus nature as the witness.

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:48.300
The importance of the
witness is clear here.

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:53.300
Nature must testify and nature
must be able to recognize

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:57.583
the questions that are asked of it or her.

00:21:58.809 --> 00:22:02.770
One has to devise a
language and ask questions

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:05.193
that nature is capable of asking.

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:11.010
This was an important
consideration in the 17th century

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:14.230
and a move away from what the alchemists

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:17.260
and natural magicians were doing.

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:21.120
Nature must be able to
repeat the same answers

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:26.120
again and again, not just one
time and a different answer

00:22:26.685 --> 00:22:29.000
the next time.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.140
A second setting which is
similar to the courtroom,

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:36.340
which is an enclosed space
where only privileged people

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:40.053
are allowed to be is the anatomy theater.

00:22:41.045 --> 00:22:46.045
An example of the anatomy
theater that Bacon

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:50.160
was well aware of was that of Vesalius

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:56.580
in his 1543 corpus,

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:02.930
De Humani Corporis Fabrica,

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:07.930
or the picture here which shows a corpse

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:15.710
being dissected on a table
in front of a great crowd

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:18.423
of people.

00:23:18.423 --> 00:23:22.540
The early anatomy theaters sloped downward

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:26.350
to the central table and the

00:23:28.016 --> 00:23:33.016
anatomist or barber
surgeon stood at the table

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:38.090
and did the dissection in the
view of all those witnesses

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:42.690
around it and opened
up the corpse to reveal

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:47.520
the secrets of nature that
were contained by the body.

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:51.660
In this particular example
of the anatomy theater

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:56.660
of Vesalius, the female body
is being dissected here.

00:23:56.730 --> 00:24:00.010
The womb is cut open just as if this were

00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:05.010
the womb of the earth being
mined by the miners and smiths

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:12.150
and Vesalius, as the
surgeon is standing erect

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:17.940
over the supine body of
the female or what Bacon

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:22.030
would later term, the corpse of nature

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:27.030
and he argued that we must
build an anatomy of the world

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:31.677
and we must attempt to dissect nature.

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:36.310
Although Bacon did not
talk specifically about

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:39.880
the anatomy theater,
he did use the language

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:44.880
of the anatomy theater
in his effort to portray

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:50.340
a method for extracting
secrets from the natural world.

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:55.340
A third setting is that of
the alchemical laboratory.

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:59.005
Bacon was very influenced by the magical

00:24:59.005 --> 00:25:02.883
and the alchemical traditions.

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:07.292
There were books in the 16th century

00:25:07.292 --> 00:25:10.360
on the secrets of nature and Bacon wanted

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:13.090
to take those ideas of the alchemists

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:15.640
and make them public
knowledge for the benefit

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:19.840
of humankind, and so in
this picture, you can see

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:24.110
all the kinds of apparatus
in this enclosed space

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:27.640
which we would now term a laboratory.

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:30.130
Bacon did not use the word laboratory,

00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:32.980
although it was introduced by Ben Johnson

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:36.340
in his play The Alchemist during the time

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:41.340
that Bacon was at the court
of James the First in 1610.

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:50.490
Experimentation in an
enclosed space is exemplified

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:53.880
by the alchemical laboratory.

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:57.310
A question is asked by the scientist,

00:25:57.310 --> 00:26:01.270
the scientist devises
an apparatus to answer

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:05.826
the question, records
the data, and that data

00:26:05.826 --> 00:26:09.213
is verified by witnesses.

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:13.470
Bacon termed this nature in constraint.

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:16.428
He said, "nature in constraint is molded

00:26:16.428 --> 00:26:19.980
"and made new by art in the hand of man."

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:24.853
This is his third state of
nature or nature in bonds.

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:31.430
In the New Atlantis,
which was Bacon's utopia,

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:35.880
which was based on Plato's
description of Atlantis

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:40.340
in his monologue, actually, The Critius,

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:45.340
and Bacon wrote the New
Atlantis and it was published

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:50.500
posthumously a year
after his death in 1627.

00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:55.740
In it, he describes a set of laboratories

00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:59.790
or what we would now think of
as a scientific institution,

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:03.400
which he called Solomon's
House, and in it,

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:07.870
he describes perspective houses where one

00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:11.070
would use lenses to understand light,

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:14.820
engine houses, furnaces, sound houses,

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:16.800
mathematical houses, all these

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:21.430
would be separate laboratories
in the New Atlantis

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:26.430
and he talks about gardens
and mines and caves, pools,

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.800
streams, and fountains,
which can be studied

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:34.800
by the apprentices who are
working in the laboratories.

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:40.820
Dissections and surgeries are carried out,

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:44.580
just as we saw in the
previous illustrations.

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:48.140
Experiments with medicines,
and most importantly,

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:52.080
creation of new animals and plants.

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:57.080
Animals that would bear young earlier

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:02.710
in their period of maturation.

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:09.890
Plants that would come to
fruition earlier in the season.

00:28:09.913 --> 00:28:14.807
He could study weather
and basically, this is

00:28:16.684 --> 00:28:21.684
what we would now think of as
a form of genetic engineering

00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:25.847
and the goal of all this, Bacon said, was

00:28:25.847 --> 00:28:28.457
"the end of our foundation
is the knowledge

00:28:28.457 --> 00:28:31.437
"of causes and secret motions of things,

00:28:31.437 --> 00:28:34.467
"and the enlarging of the
bounds of human empire

00:28:34.467 --> 00:28:37.760
"to the effecting of all things possible."

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:40.959
This is the grand vision
which Bacon prepares

00:28:40.959 --> 00:28:45.860
by the end of the first
quarter of the 17th century

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:49.513
and which is to inspire his followers,

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:55.180
the Academy Deltumento in
Italy, The Royal Society

00:28:55.180 --> 00:29:00.180
in England, the French
Academy of Sciences in France

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:06.470
all were modeled on this
vision of Bacon's New Atlantis

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:09.403
and Bacon's vision of dominion.

00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:14.750
The idea of the contained,
controlled experiment

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:18.460
toward which Bacon was
tending, but was not there yet,

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:23.460
is epitomized by the
1660s by Robert Boyle.

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:28.547
The air pump is shown here
in these illustrations

00:29:28.547 --> 00:29:33.547
and science is pointing
upward to the heavens

00:29:33.981 --> 00:29:38.170
with her fingers, but
downward to Robert Boyle

00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:39.423
with her elbow.

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:45.510
On one side we have the
alchemical laboratory.

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:49.043
This is the place from
whence science has come.

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:55.150
On the other side, the bell
jar which is the epitome

00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:59.893
of the scientific experiment by the 1660s.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:06.200
One could put a living
animal or a plant or a bird

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:10.760
inside the bell jar and evacuate the air

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:13.303
and then study what happened.

00:30:15.365 --> 00:30:20.250
The bell jar is to us
today as the Cyclotron was

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:27.120
to the 20th century or as
the large Hedron Collider

00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:30.743
is to the 21st century.

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:35.573
This was the epitome of science.

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:41.210
It was not without its critics, however,

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:45.110
and the bell jar is shown
here in an experiment

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:50.110
by Joseph Wright of
Derby in which he shows

00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:55.010
an experiment on a bird in the air pump

00:30:55.010 --> 00:31:00.010
and you can see here how the
experimenter, the scientist,

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:06.470
has taken the bird, the
cockatoo, from the cage up here

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:14.890
and the cockatoo is now in the bell jar

00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:19.890
and he holds in his hand
the power of life and death.

00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:25.540
The ability to turn the
stopcock and evacuate the air

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:28.883
and kill the bird in the bell jar.

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:33.810
If you look at the gendered
responses of the men

00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:38.230
and women here, the men
are looking right at

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:43.010
the experiment or
contemplating as the older man

00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:47.140
down here, contemplating
death by looking at a skull,

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:52.140
but the women are looking
at the men experiencing

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:57.720
the experiment vicariously
or hiding their eyes

00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:00.654
from the experiment.

00:32:00.654 --> 00:32:05.654
The men are witnessing the
emergence of a scientific truth

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:11.950
but the women are experiencing
a visceral reality.

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:19.630
By the the end of the
17th century, we have

00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:23.905
the experimental tradition
coming into conjunction

00:32:23.905 --> 00:32:27.160
with the mathematical tradition.

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:30.196
The mathematical tradition being revived

00:32:30.196 --> 00:32:35.196
by philosophers such
as Descartes and Hobbs

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:41.440
and by scientists in
the late 17th century,

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:44.963
epitomized by Newton.

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:50.930
Newton's philosophy of
the mechanical universe

00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:57.160
brought together the heavens
and the work of Kepler

00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:00.870
and Copernicus and the terrestrial world

00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:05.870
with the work of Galileo
and pulled them together

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:13.330
in a world that is a
contained, controlled space

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:19.130
in which there are ideal
spheres, the planets

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:22.550
must be conceptualized as ideal spheres

00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:27.540
with their point of
gravitation at the center

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:32.540
and of a frictionless
world, no air resistance,

00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:38.383
in order for the
mathematical laws to hold.

00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:42.899
The mechanistic view
of nature is the result

00:33:42.899 --> 00:33:47.899
of the period between
Copernicus and Newton

00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:51.283
at the end of the century.

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:57.860
The worldview changes from
an organism to a machine.

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:02.100
Nature now, as a machine,
is made up of parts,

00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:07.100
of hard, glassy atoms or
particles, as Newton called them,

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:12.380
that can be rearranged
from outside by a scientist

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:14.070
or an engineer.

00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:18.390
The world becomes a
clock-like universe as opposed

00:34:18.390 --> 00:34:20.620
to a nurturing mother.

00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:25.420
God becomes an engineer
and a mathematician.

00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:30.060
Mathematics becomes the
source of valid knowledge

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:33.000
or truth of the external world,

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.960
and it is through
mathematics that one is able

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:39.360
to solve equations and
therefore, to predict,

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:42.739
and if you can predict,
therefore you can control

00:34:42.739 --> 00:34:45.263
and therefore dominate nature.

00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:50.390
The control of nature
through experimentation,

00:34:50.390 --> 00:34:53.495
which was Bacon's vision,
and through mathematics,

00:34:53.495 --> 00:34:58.260
leads to this idea of
the domination of nature

00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:03.260
through controlled spaces and
closed mathematical systems.

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:10.500
This vision accompanies
the spread of Europe

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:13.436
and the rise of the nation
states into the New World

00:35:13.436 --> 00:35:17.080
and it's through the rise
of science and technology

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:21.130
that Bacon's vision of
the recovery of Eden

00:35:21.130 --> 00:35:23.733
begins to be played out.

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:29.350
Eden can be reinvented
or recreated on earth

00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:34.350
and as the New World is settled
and people move westward,

00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:40.930
first the forests of the
eastern states of the US

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:46.080
are cut down and turned into
farms and managed gardens

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:49.400
and then the western deserts are irrigated

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:52.640
and turned, also, into gardens.

00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:56.737
The biblical idea of not
only recovering Eden,

00:35:59.452 --> 00:36:01.890
but of making the desert
blossom as the rose,

00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:04.810
occurs in the process of the settlement

00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:07.130
of the United States.

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:10.170
Nature now can be thought of as a garden,

00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:14.250
very much like the
controlled, contained spaces

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:17.500
that Bacon was working toward.

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:21.480
Nature as a garden surrounded by fences

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:26.250
in which one puts fertilizers,
whether it's manures

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:31.250
or later chemical fertilizers,
and still later, pesticides.

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:38.780
What about the challenges
to this mechanistic view

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:41.410
of the control and management of nature

00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:46.410
which we inherit from the 17th century?

00:36:48.364 --> 00:36:52.973
One of the first challenges
is that of ecology.

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:59.540
The word devised by
Ernst Haeckel, it comes

00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:03.520
from the Greek word
oikos meaning household.

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:07.051
The root of both the
word ecology and economy,

00:37:07.051 --> 00:37:12.051
and he wrote in 1866 about
the science of the relations

00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:17.170
of living organisms to the external world.

00:37:17.170 --> 00:37:20.496
This is not the contained,
controlled system.

00:37:20.496 --> 00:37:24.700
This is now relationships of all organisms

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:27.860
to each other and to their environment.

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:32.260
In 1869, he wrote that,
"the body of knowledge

00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:37.260
"concerning the economy of
nature," is what he means

00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:39.320
by the oikos.

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:42.387
The "study of the complex interrelations

00:37:42.387 --> 00:37:44.250
"in the struggle for existence."

00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:48.180
He was influenced here by Darwin's work

00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:53.180
and he used that word
ecology spelled O-E-K

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:57.023
at this point in 1873.

00:37:58.050 --> 00:38:02.880
The person who introduced
ecology from Haeckel

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:06.700
into the United States
was a woman and her name

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:09.470
was Ellen Swallow Richards.

00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:12.570
Ellen Swallow attended Vassar College

00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:16.240
and then she went on to
MIT as a special student

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:20.233
where she married a chemist
by the name of Richards.

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:26.200
In 1892, she gave a talk to
the Boston Boot and Shoe Club

00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:31.610
(laughs) in which she
christened a new science

00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:36.420
which she called ecology
and it was reported

00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:38.720
in the newspapers the next day.

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:42.893
A new science, Mrs.
Richards names it ecology.

00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:50.080
She introduced the term
into the United States.

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:54.250
We have to credit her with that and also

00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:59.250
using the term human ecology,
the concept of human ecology

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:05.140
which she developed in 1907 in her book

00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:07.860
The Sanitation in Daily Life.

00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:10.870
Here she is shown
slightly before her death

00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:13.750
with an honorary doctorate
which she received

00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:15.293
from Smith College.

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:20.300
Ecology introduced by
men was a little later

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:25.300
and one of those who used the
word was Frederic Clements

00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:32.170
in 1905 and he developed the
science of plant succession

00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:37.730
where some of his ideas
have been criticized

00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:42.360
in recent years, but he moved us back

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:45.730
toward the idea of the
organism, the living organism

00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:50.730
or the organismic character
of community and ecology.

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:55.160
During the early 20th
century, we have the emergence

00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:59.550
of ecology, of ecological
systems which are based

00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:02.630
on relationships and
which are open systems

00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:04.690
rather than closed systems.

00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:07.630
In which matter and energy are exchanged

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:10.290
across boundaries.

00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:13.170
Another challenge to mechanistic science

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:18.170
was at the level of the very
minute and the very large.

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:24.720
Einstein's special theory of relativity

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:27.620
followed later by his general theory

00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:32.620
and especially his ideas
about the quantum structure

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:36.663
of light or as light made up of photons.

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:42.240
Einstein challenged mechanistic science

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:46.420
at the level of the very
small and at the level

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:51.420
of the speed of light, but
in the every day world,

00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:55.470
a major challenge came
through the development

00:40:55.470 --> 00:41:00.470
of the science of chaos
followed later by the idea

00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:02.950
of complexity science.

00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:07.950
Edward Lorenz, in 1972,
wrote a foundational paper

00:41:09.972 --> 00:41:13.502
entitled Can the Flap
of a Butterfly's Wings

00:41:13.502 --> 00:41:18.502
in Brazil Result in a Tornado in Texas?

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:21.960
Known later as the Butterfly Effect.

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:26.333
The idea being that the atmosphere

00:41:26.333 --> 00:41:31.320
is fundamentally irregular and unstable

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:35.640
and that weather patters are
chaotic and unpredictable

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:39.690
and the best you can do
is the one day prediction.

00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:43.585
Similarly, most environmental
and biological systems

00:41:43.585 --> 00:41:48.585
are non-linear systems and chaotic.

00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:51.820
Chaos is the usual situation.

00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:55.966
It is the very unusual
situation that we can think of

00:41:55.966 --> 00:42:00.966
as the closed, contained
world where we can predict

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:04.003
the outcomes.

00:42:05.561 --> 00:42:09.470
All of this, to me, means that we need

00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:13.960
to rethink the foundations
of our ethical systems

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:17.910
of our relationship to the natural world.

00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:19.960
We are part of the ecosystem.

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:23.690
We are part of nature and
we are in a relationship

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:28.690
with other organisms and
non-living things as well.

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:33.600
How do we get, then, from
the control of nature

00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:36.610
and the management of
nature, which was so powerful

00:42:36.610 --> 00:42:40.590
by the end of the 19th
century and which was really

00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:45.590
the underlying ethic of the
settlement of the New World

00:42:46.035 --> 00:42:49.576
to the idea of a partnership ethic

00:42:49.576 --> 00:42:52.533
in terms of a different relationship

00:42:52.533 --> 00:42:55.130
between humanity and nature?

00:42:55.130 --> 00:42:58.723
Where did it come from
and how can it help us?

00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:03.730
I formulate the idea of
the partnership ethic

00:43:03.730 --> 00:43:05.010
as the following.

00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:10.010
A combination of utilitarian
ethics and ecological ethics.

00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:14.352
The greatest good for the
human and non-human communities

00:43:14.352 --> 00:43:19.147
is in their mutual living interdependence.

00:43:19.147 --> 00:43:24.147
I argue that in order to
actuate a partnership ethic,

00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:31.800
we need to think about
five additional precepts.

00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:35.610
First of all, that we have equity between

00:43:35.610 --> 00:43:37.963
the human and non-human communities.

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:44.120
We are living in a urban
community here in Berkeley,

00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:48.990
but we are dependent on
an ecological community,

00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:53.990
a natural world in which we
are in a vital relationship.

00:43:55.763 --> 00:44:00.240
We need to give moral
consideration, not only for humans,

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:04.540
but for other organisms,
for other species.

00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:08.331
We need to respect both cultural diversity

00:44:08.331 --> 00:44:13.220
and biodiversity and we
need to include women,

00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:17.110
minorities, and non-human
nature in the code

00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:18.993
of ethical accountability.

00:44:20.410 --> 00:44:23.770
In order to bring this
out, we need a new kind

00:44:23.770 --> 00:44:25.100
of management.

00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:29.060
Not the domination and control of nature

00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:32.910
but an ecologically sound
management that is going

00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:36.494
to maintain the health
of the human community

00:44:36.494 --> 00:44:38.933
and the non-human community.

00:44:40.119 --> 00:44:42.070
Why do we need it?

00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:47.070
Because we are in the midst
of a global ecological crisis.

00:44:47.330 --> 00:44:52.100
We are experiencing climate
change, ozone depletion,

00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:57.100
deforestation, soil erosion,
loss of our forests,

00:44:57.330 --> 00:45:02.330
and the endangerment of thousands
of species on the planet,

00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:07.370
and because population is still growing,

00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:10.480
although its growth rate is tapering off,

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:14.630
but we now are close to
seven billion people.

00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:18.120
In another year or two, we
will be at seven billion

00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:21.920
and perhaps by 2040,
somewhere between eight

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:26.590
and 12 billion, depending
on the rate of decline.

00:45:28.973 --> 00:45:33.973
The origins of partnership
ethics come about

00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:37.660
with the rise of conservation,
with the conservation

00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:41.000
and then followed by the
environmental movements.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:46.000
The forest reserves created
in the 19th century,

00:45:46.361 --> 00:45:50.480
range lands and the conservation movement

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:54.223
of the turn of the 19th
into the 20th century.

00:45:55.320 --> 00:46:00.320
George Perkins Marsh in 1864,
argued for what I think of

00:46:01.330 --> 00:46:03.280
as a partnership relationship.

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:06.927
He said, "man should become
a co-worker with nature

00:46:06.927 --> 00:46:10.510
"in the reconstruction
of the damaged fabric."

00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:14.540
He argued that we could
restore the waters and forests

00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:17.120
and the bogs that were laid waste

00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:20.873
by human improvidence or malice.

00:46:22.690 --> 00:46:26.820
And then in the middle
of the 20th century,

00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:29.729
we have the work of the ecologist,

00:46:29.729 --> 00:46:34.729
originally wildlife
biologist, Aldo Leopold,

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:37.550
and he uses the word partnership.

00:46:37.550 --> 00:46:40.257
He says, "when land
does well for its owner

00:46:40.257 --> 00:46:43.157
"and the owner does well by his land,

00:46:43.157 --> 00:46:46.557
"when both end up by better of reason

00:46:46.557 --> 00:46:50.167
"of their partnership,
then we have conservation."

00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:55.415
Women, also, have been instrumental

00:46:55.415 --> 00:46:59.960
in helping to formulate
and move us toward the idea

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:02.760
of partnership based on relations,

00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:06.750
based on relationship
between men and women,

00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:10.060
between men and men,
between women and women,

00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:13.480
and between humanity
and the natural world.

00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:16.750
Val Plumwood, an Australian philosopher

00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:19.796
wrote Feminism and the Mastery of Nature

00:47:19.796 --> 00:47:23.900
and she said that
relation must be the basis

00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:27.640
for a new ethic, an ethic of care,

00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:32.640
and the relational self
is based in friendship

00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:36.795
and respect and care for the other.

00:47:36.795 --> 00:47:41.540
My idea of the partnership
ethic is grounded in the idea

00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:46.010
of relation, not in the
ego, not in society,

00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:49.210
not in the land, as Leopold had said,

00:47:49.210 --> 00:47:52.070
but in the idea of relationship,

00:47:52.070 --> 00:47:54.750
of non-dominating interactions

00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:57.840
that allow the earth to flourish.

00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:01.750
How do we get in touch
with nature in a different

00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:02.960
and new way?

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:06.590
One idea is proposed by David Abram,

00:48:06.590 --> 00:48:10.200
the philosopher who wrote
The Spell of the Sensuous

00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:13.220
and he argues that we
can hear nature's voice

00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:14.700
in a different way.

00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:19.700
Nature speaks differently
to us if we listen,

00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:25.534
if we smell, if we
taste, if we be in nature

00:48:25.534 --> 00:48:29.630
in a different way than Francis Bacon

00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:31.770
would have wanted us to.

00:48:31.770 --> 00:48:35.810
By hearing the rustling
of leaves in the oak tree

00:48:35.810 --> 00:48:38.590
or by listening to the rhythm and lilt

00:48:38.590 --> 00:48:40.513
of the local soundscape.

00:48:41.570 --> 00:48:46.570
Nature is fundamentally unpredictable

00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:49.040
and what are unpredictable?

00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:54.040
Hurricanes, tornadoes, fires, earthquakes.

00:48:56.230 --> 00:49:01.230
These are the aspects of
nature that make it necessary

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:06.400
for us to rethink our relationship to it.

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:11.400
And here is an example from
Yellowstone National Park

00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:17.180
of simulations of what
the land looked like

00:49:17.547 --> 00:49:22.410
when fire suppression began in 1872

00:49:22.410 --> 00:49:27.410
and when fires took over and
transformed Yellowstone Park

00:49:29.310 --> 00:49:31.013
in 1972.

00:49:34.170 --> 00:49:37.653
How do we work in partnership with nature?

00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:43.780
Landscape architects, urban planners,

00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:48.780
have devised ways to think
about nature and partnership

00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:53.466
with humans through design
and in this illustration,

00:49:53.466 --> 00:49:58.466
it shows how the river has
continually been straightened

00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:04.440
over time, channel wise,
between 1912, 1925, 1945,

00:50:07.077 --> 00:50:12.077
and 1965, and then how we
can restore the meander

00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:17.260
in the river and restore the wetlands

00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:20.926
which will allow us now,
instead of controlling

00:50:20.926 --> 00:50:25.926
and dominating nature, to
become a partner with it.

00:50:27.450 --> 00:50:30.820
Another example here in Oakland

00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:33.180
and the University of
California's the work

00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:38.170
of Louise Mozingo in
landscape architecture

00:50:38.170 --> 00:50:41.440
who has worked with a
culturally diverse group

00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:45.098
of citizens in the Oakland Hills.

00:50:45.098 --> 00:50:50.098
European Americans, African
Americans, Asian American,

00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:54.970
Hispanic Americans
working together to devise

00:50:54.970 --> 00:50:59.970
a new landscape for the
area in which they live.

00:51:01.675 --> 00:51:06.675
In Los Angeles, another
example from California,

00:51:06.942 --> 00:51:11.942
Achva Stein and Norman
Millar worked out a plan

00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:18.100
for using the spaces
under freeways for gardens

00:51:19.310 --> 00:51:23.630
or having vegetable gardens on the roofs

00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:28.630
of parking structures and
of using the neighborhood

00:51:30.035 --> 00:51:35.035
which is also culturally
diverse to grow food

00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:41.520
and to transform it
from concrete structures

00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:46.483
into a living, organic,
revitalized system.

00:51:48.190 --> 00:51:52.240
I would like to propose in concluding

00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:55.260
that we have come a
long way from the world

00:51:55.260 --> 00:51:56.850
of Francis Bacon.

00:51:56.850 --> 00:51:59.530
We've come a long way from the idea

00:51:59.530 --> 00:52:02.780
that we need to dominate
and control nature

00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:07.200
in order for humans to
survive on the planet

00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:11.310
and we are now at the point
where we need a new ethic

00:52:11.310 --> 00:52:15.560
for our survival and that
is an ethic of partnership

00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:18.580
between humanity and the natural world.

00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:20.177
Thank you very much.

00:52:20.177 --> 00:52:23.177
(audience applauds)

00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:30.717
- [Man] In terms of the
degradation of nature

00:52:30.717 --> 00:52:35.590
and the attitude, you
got as far as science

00:52:35.590 --> 00:52:37.960
and technology and the mechanistic,

00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:40.140
but what about the corporate mentality,

00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:42.340
the whole corporatization of the world,

00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:45.933
how that's affecting the
ecological imbalance?

00:52:45.933 --> 00:52:49.220
And that's another
human being, as it were,

00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:52.580
and has the stages of a person,
how do we deal with that?

00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:57.120
- Right, well, the egocentric
ethic is what is good

00:52:57.120 --> 00:53:00.910
for the individual or
the corporation acting

00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:05.910
as an individual is good
for society as a whole.

00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:10.740
The egocentric ethic, which
I wanna move away from,

00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:15.740
is exemplified potentially
in our oil spill

00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:20.940
off the gulf, and that is
a attempt to make nature

00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:27.680
into a closed, confined space
and now that it has blown up,

00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:33.221
the forces of nature have
come through to the surface.

00:53:33.221 --> 00:53:36.770
They are trying to cap
it off and close it off

00:53:36.770 --> 00:53:40.700
with a tube and then a top over it.

00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:45.490
That is a mechanical system
and that is a mechanical system

00:53:45.490 --> 00:53:49.420
devised by corporate capitalism
which goes hand in hand

00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:50.563
with mechanism.

00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:55.140
We live in in a corporate,
capitalist world

00:53:55.140 --> 00:54:00.140
that has an ethic of mechanism
and the egocentric approach

00:54:01.410 --> 00:54:06.410
to ethics, so I would argue
that a partnership ethic

00:54:06.571 --> 00:54:11.571
can sometimes work with
respect to corporations.

00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:16.660
There are numerous
examples where a company

00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:20.670
wanting to develop a new research site

00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:25.600
on a large piece of land
will need to negotiate

00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:30.600
in partnership with the
community to create wetlands

00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:36.980
and open spaces and migratory bird flyways

00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:40.870
through the place that they are working.

00:54:40.870 --> 00:54:44.290
They need to have green architecture

00:54:44.290 --> 00:54:48.340
and recycled water systems and so on,

00:54:48.340 --> 00:54:52.300
so we don't have to give
up corporate capitalism,

00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:55.800
but we need to be able to work with,

00:54:55.800 --> 00:55:00.583
especially small businesses,
in a partnership relationship.

00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:02.824
- [Woman] Thank you very much.

00:55:02.824 --> 00:55:06.320
I have two questions, if that's okay.

00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:09.100
The first one is linked
to the area of the world

00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:12.380
that I'm honored to work in
which is the Bolivian Andes

00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:14.470
and when I go there to work, I work

00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:17.980
with local Aymara natives who live there

00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:21.690
and their worldview about
nature, they're farmers.

00:55:21.690 --> 00:55:24.260
They've been farmers for 4,000 years,

00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:27.690
so it's not recent, but
their view of nature

00:55:27.690 --> 00:55:31.090
is that it is a relationship
that you cannot get rid of it.

00:55:31.090 --> 00:55:35.290
It's like you're born into a
family and you can move away,

00:55:35.290 --> 00:55:39.452
but that's your mother and
that is your relationship.

00:55:39.452 --> 00:55:43.480
They see it as a partnership,
I think, as you're seeing it,

00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:48.480
but it's much more intimate and
almost mutually responsible.

00:55:49.490 --> 00:55:53.100
The concept of responsibility
goes both ways for them

00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:57.320
and it seems to me that there
may be some indigenous views

00:55:57.320 --> 00:56:02.320
of working with nature, where
the humans aren't so different

00:56:03.692 --> 00:56:05.970
or desperate, which I
think is what you're saying

00:56:05.970 --> 00:56:08.243
my moving the table out in the forest

00:56:08.243 --> 00:56:09.076
and having their voices.

00:56:09.076 --> 00:56:11.380
They just don't see that dichotomy.

00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:12.810
I know this is our western tradition,

00:56:12.810 --> 00:56:14.480
but there are other
traditions where people

00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:16.680
have been more sustainable,
so it seems to me

00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:20.100
that might be helpful
in a new conversation

00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:23.020
and the second thing is that
keeps lurking in my mind

00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:28.020
is these Copenhagen, Tokyo,
and recently in Bolivia itself

00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:32.036
in Cochabamba, there was
a meeting just last week.

00:56:32.036 --> 00:56:37.036
Why are those, do you
think those are progressing

00:56:38.030 --> 00:56:39.360
and moving in the right direction?

00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:41.610
Why do we keep hearing
that those are stalling

00:56:41.610 --> 00:56:46.610
and how can we merge models
that you're proposing

00:56:47.150 --> 00:56:49.670
with on the ground, not just corporations,

00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:51.113
but on the ground action?

00:56:52.130 --> 00:56:55.149
- Well, thank you very
much for the contribution

00:56:55.149 --> 00:56:59.680
about the Andes and
especially indigenous peoples

00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:04.455
and I agree completely with
you that there are practices

00:57:04.455 --> 00:57:09.455
and models for us to
engage with and all people

00:57:11.308 --> 00:57:15.180
with ideas such as this
coming to the table

00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:20.180
may help us move toward
what you're asking for,

00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:24.100
which is to have the people who are doing

00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:29.070
the negotiations at these
meetings take on ideas

00:57:29.070 --> 00:57:34.070
of partnership in that
we come to the table

00:57:34.670 --> 00:57:37.802
with the expectation
that we are going to take

00:57:37.802 --> 00:57:42.802
a year, two years at the
table to try to reach

00:57:43.550 --> 00:57:45.000
an understanding.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.890
We don't go to the meeting
and then we go home

00:57:47.890 --> 00:57:52.440
and things fall away, but we stay at it

00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:57.440
until we get to the point of
a sustainable relationship.

00:57:58.270 --> 00:58:00.350
Thank you very much for everything.

00:58:00.350 --> 00:58:01.841
I appreciate it.

00:58:01.841 --> 00:58:04.841
(audience applauds)

00:58:06.216 --> 00:58:08.799
(gentle music)
