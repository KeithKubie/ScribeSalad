00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.060
Alright. This is totally easy once 
you understand the physics.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.760
Watch this. Left, yep right, go back to the right. It's easy!

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.930
[unintelligible] flip. 1..2..3.. Yeah!

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.930
Awesome!

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.280
So, as a kid

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.460
I spent many an hour in a book about the drawings of Leonardo Da Vinci. In particular

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.650
his flying machines. Check out this medieval helicopter. 
It looks like

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.840
it would work, but you can't really judge a book by it's cover because there's no way to provide counter torque to the

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.010
body of the aircraft. Modern day helicopters do this by providing a counter

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.200
torque rotor on a boom, a tail rotor. This works by

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.300
stopping the rotation of the helicopter. But here's what you haven't thought about.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.480
You are, after all, applying a force to a free floating body, 
which means that

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.660
body wants to drift. So how does a helicopter 
keep from drifting?

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.840
We're gonna take a journey. We're gonna go from a top level knowledge of how helicopters

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.010
work to a really deep understanding.
How you doing Mr Ledbetter?

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.210
Hi, I'm Richard Ledbetter. I'm a docent at the National Air and Space Museum.
(Destin) Alright! So what do you have to show us today

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.250
about how helicopters work.
(Mr Ledbetter) Well, I guess what we're gonna talk about is kinda the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.320
main rotor system on a conventional helicopter, and the main rotor system basically provides

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.500
both the lift and the control for the helicopter.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.680
And how we control the helicopter is by varying the pitch at each of the rotor blades.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.030
(Destin) So how do you vary the pitch on a helicopter when it's rotating, when the blades are rotating?

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.220
We use, on most helicopters, we use something called a swashplate,

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.270
and essentially what a swashplate does, is it converts non-rotating to rotating

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.460
control motion. We have two kinds of control for the helicopter, and

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.640
for cyclic inputs, what happens is that that

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.700
swashplate will just simply rotate forward or rotate aft, and that

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.870
changes the input to each of the rotor blades, but for collective pitch what will happen is that

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.040
swashplate will actually move up or down. That will actually change

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.210
the pitch in both of those rotor blades at exactly the same time.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.400
(Destin) Ohh! OK I just learned something.
So in summary there's

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.600
three types of control. There's collective pitch, there is cyclic pitch,

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.780
and there's antitorque. Of course antitorque is the rotor system on the back.
(Destin) So lets start with

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.960
collective Carl. So what is this magical device right here?

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.150
(Carl) This is the swashplate, and this is the source of all control for any helicopter.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.330
Any direction the swashplate moves, for the most part, the helicopter

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.470
follows. So the collective is where you change the

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.630
pitch of both blades, either up or down, and that pulls the helicopter

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.800
up or down. You do not control the altitude of the helicopter by the speed 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.990
of the blades. That stays the same.
(Destin) It's translated up or down, and that

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.200
controls how much of a bite of air the rotors take. Is that correct?

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.240
(Carl) That is. Yep. Absolutely. And that'll actually make the helicopter either go up or

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.290
down. Or if it's upside down, it's backwards.
(Destin) Oh yeah, cause it's upside down.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.490
Cause I'm a helicopter genius. [laugh]
(Carl) The tail rotor, just like the main blades

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.690
never changes speed, so in order to control the thrust, we

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.870
change the pitch on the blades, so it can push or pull

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.050
in both directions.
(Destin) And the reason it does that, it's basically a reaction

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.240
torque to what's going on up here. The blades are putting a torque into the body

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.420
is that correct?
(Carl) Yep the act of spinning the blades makes the helicopter want to go the opposite direction.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.620
(Destin) Makes sense. Can you show me what cyclic pitch looks like now.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.810
(Carl) Cyclic pitch is where the swashplate tilts, and through the linkage

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.010
controls the pitch of the blades and changes it every revolution

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.200
to control the pitch and roll of the helicopter.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.390
(Destin) Give me cyclic pitch in this direction.. 
OK but then if I rotate it

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.480
it'll change as it goes around correct?
(Carl) It does change.
(Destin) So.. so.. that

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.590
linkage rides on the swashplate and then pushes up on the side of the

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.760
blade, and then that in turn changes the blade depending on where it is in the

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.940
rotation of the rotor shaft right?
(Carl) Correct.
(Destin) Alright. And so, what does that do for ya?

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.120
(Carl) That lets me flip it any way I want to.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.310
[laughs]
(Destin) That lets me do wizardry.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.390
[rotor noise]

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.750
OK now you speak helicopter.

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:24.940
And for the next few videos, prepare for your mind to be blown, but we're going to be using these fundamental terms

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.980
so get ready.
