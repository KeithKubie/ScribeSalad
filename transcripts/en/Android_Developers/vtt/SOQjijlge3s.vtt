00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.780
So now that we can sign
the user in all the way

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.020
to the Games service, let's
sign them out as well.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.379
Now for the purpose of this
tutorial and to help debugging,

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.020
I'm going to put this as a
button on the front page.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.470
Realistically, I don't
think you'd want to do this.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.410
Sign-out, you'd
probably want to keep

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.280
more hidden in a menu
option somewhere.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.590
My hunch is it's going
to be fairly uncommon

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.420
for an actual user to want
to sign out from Play Games

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.885
once they've signed in.

00:00:33.885 --> 00:00:35.260
No one's going to
say, I'd really

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.120
like to stop earning
achievement progress now.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.920
However, it does
make your life easier

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.900
for testing against both sort
of the signed-in and signed-out

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.770
state.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.510
So let's do that.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.930
I'm going to switch over to
my {NIB.} And quite possibly,

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.160
for the reasons I just stated,
there is no official artwork

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.630
for Google+ sign-out button.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.880
However, I did include
some with the artwork ZIP

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.550
file that we're going use.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.220
So first things first, I'm going
to add a button onto the screen

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.720
here.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.360
This is going to be a
custom button with no text.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.970
And I have a-- notice we have
a whole lot more images now.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.730
That's thanks to the
Play Games services

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.711
bundle that we've
added to our project,

00:01:25.711 --> 00:01:26.710
and here's our sign-out.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.800
And we're just going to keep
this for all of our states.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.760
All right.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:55.220
Next, let's open up
our assistant editor,

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.380
and I'm going to Control-drag
to add an ID outlet-- sorry,

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.670
IB outlet, and we're going
to call this signOutButton.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.430
And then, let's say
underneath my sign-in button

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.730
was pressed method, I
will add a sign-out button

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.600
was pressed method.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.020
Now, let's fill this out.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.740
You might think, gosh, since we
signed in through GPP sign-in,

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.940
we could sign out
through GPP sign-in.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.240
And indeed, there is
a sign-out method.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.180
However, we're not
going to do that here.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.740
And that's because
there is no equivalent

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.550
finish with auth
handler for signing out.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.190
And you'll end up
in this weird state

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.480
where you'll have signed out
from your GPP sign-in object,

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.000
but your GPG manager, the
Google Play Games manager,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.720
has no idea that you signed out.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.820
It still might try to
access the cache data

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.960
and might try to submit
scores and achievements

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.740
without realizing, until
later, that something is wrong.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.960
So we're not going to do this.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.370
And instead, we're
going to call GPGManager

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.810
sharedInstance signout.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.720
And this method will
do a number of things.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.810
One, the GPG manager will talk
to GPP sign-in shared instance

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.560
and call sign-out on that.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.080
In addition, it will clear
out any cache data that

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.860
gets stored on
behalf of the user

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.040
and perform some
additional cleanup tasks.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.250
So this is really the
right way to sign out.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.910
We can try this and
see what happens.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.790
Whoops, looks like
my sign-in button

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.290
is offscreen or my sign-off
button is offscreen--

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.860
and that's because I
forgot to go back in here

00:03:51.860 --> 00:04:01.430
and adjust my auto sizing to
make sure that it is anchored

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.600
to the bottom
instead of the top.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.980
Sorry about that.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.650
And yes, I suppose
I should really

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.380
be starting to use auto
layout and constraints here.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.000
I just haven't gotten
used to it yet.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.880
Anyway, with that out of
the way, let's run it.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:16.380
There we go.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.269
There's our buttons.

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.210
So I'm already signed in,
as you can see in our NSLog,

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.350
and now I'm going to sign out.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.520
And actually, nothing happens.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.600
But I am actually signed out
because if I sign in again,

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.440
it will take me back to the
OAuth 2.0 permissions screen.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.070
Because I have signed
out, the service

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.280
says, OK, if you want
to sign in again,

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.910
we are going to double check
and confirm rather than sign you

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.180
in silently, which is
the right behavior.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.506
So I'm going to go
back and click Accept.

00:04:49.506 --> 00:04:54.370
I'm going to go back in, and it
looks like I'm signed in again.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:55.730
So this is nice.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.090
However, your
typical user is not

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.300
going to be able to look
at their console log

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.690
to figure out whether they're
signed in or signed out.

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.050
So let's add one more
refinement, which

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.620
is hiding or showing the
appropriate buttons based

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.090
on your signed-in status.

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.630
So I'm going to
stop this, and we're

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:17.880
going to go into my intro
view controller dot m file,

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.710
and let's create
another method-- I'm

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:37.840
going to put it up here-- called
refreshInterfaceBasedOnSignin,

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.809
because I like
long method names.

00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:41.600
The first question we
need to ask ourselves

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.640
is, how do we know if the
user is signed in or not?

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.340
One way, I suppose, to do it
would be to set up an instance

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.670
variable, and perhaps, it
might finish with auth handler.

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.010
I could set this to true or yes.

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.120
And then the sign-out,
I could set it to no.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.030
Turns out we can also
get this information

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.240
by asking the GPG manager.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:05.210
And the way you do this is we
create a little BOOL, signedIn

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:13.370
equals GPGManager
sharedInstance hasAuthorizer.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.120
And this is essentially a way of
asking, is the user signed it?

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.090
The engineer who has
written this method

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.000
would like me to let you know
that technically, it's really

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.560
a method that determines
whether the library sees

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.450
an auth object associated
with this user.

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.310
It doesn't actually confirm
that this auth object is valid

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:32.000
or not.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.130
But for all intents
and purposes,

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:37.370
this is a good way to find
out if the user is signed in.

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.780
And then, we can simply hide
or show buttons based on this.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.540
So we're going to call our
self that sign-in button.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:50.160
We'll hide this, if
user is signed in.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:57.240
And our sign-out button, we
will set to not user signed in.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.390
In addition, let's
change that label

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.227
where we tell the
user to sign in.

00:07:01.227 --> 00:07:03.560
Probably don't need to tell
them that if they're already

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.480
signed in.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:10.050
So if signed in,
self.signinlabel.txt

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:13.230
equals Welcome, player!

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:23.880
Otherwise, and this is
where you can tell them

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.490
sign in for achievements
and leaderboards.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:32.380
All right.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.050
Now, we just have
to call this method

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:35.950
at the appropriate moments.

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:37.650
Turns out there are
three places where

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:39.900
we want to call this method.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.680
The first would be to finish
with auth, after we've

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.360
called sign in to
Google Play Games.

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:49.510
It would also be
appropriate to put this

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:52.360
at the end of our sign-in
to Google Play Games

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.650
method, either one works.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:00.140
Next, we're going to want to
do it on sign out was pressed.

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:01.790
Remember that
signing out does not

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:04.210
hit our finish with
auth error handler,

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:06.460
so we'll also want to
make sure we call it here.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.740
And then finally, we do want
to call it in view will appear.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:32.280
This last call is nice to
have in something like this,

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:35.232
where you've got your views
inside a navigation controller,

00:08:35.232 --> 00:08:36.940
and maybe you're
switching back and forth

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.360
between different views.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.429
When this view is
ready to come up again,

00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:42.950
it's good to make sure that
all the interface elements are

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:46.864
as they should be based
on user's sign-in status.

00:08:46.864 --> 00:08:47.780
So let's try this now.

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:56.770
And this time, we have a little
"Welcome, player!" message.

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:59.400
The sign-in button is hidden,
and the sign-out button

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.790
is the only one
that's available.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:04.090
If I click Sign Out,
nearly immediately,

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:07.410
the sign-out button goes away,
the sign-in button is back.

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:09.570
I get back the prompt
again to sign in

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:11.330
for leaderboards
and achievements.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:18.660
I'm going to say, yes, I'm
going to accept, and we're back.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:26.250
So now that this is done, I can
go back into my [? NIB ?] file,

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:28.720
and I'm going to move
my sign-out button

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.430
right on top of my sign-in
button, since only one of them

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:34.060
will ever be
visible at any time.

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:34.840
So there you go.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.790
We're now properly changing the
look of the interface depending

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:40.440
on whether or not the user
has signed into Play Games.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.587
So this is great.

00:09:41.587 --> 00:09:43.170
There are a couple
of more refinements

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:44.810
I would like to make,
and we'll handle

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:45.940
those in the next lesson.

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:46.860
Stay tuned.

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:57.332
