10 Offensively Racist Moments In Kids Movies
That You Never Noticed

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.380
Kids movies, by their very nature, are generally
quite lighthearted and innocent.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.070
Anything that's aimed at the younger generation
should have as little offensive material in

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.270
it as possible - but that's not always the
case.Disney in particular - as you'll see

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.270
in this video - are guilty of some truly terrible
racism.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.609
Granted, most of the movies in this video
are quite old - so it's a tiny bit more understandable

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.100
- but there are some modern movies - both
Disney and non-Disney - that have some really

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.860
shocking racism and racial stereotyping in
them.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.340
In recent times, Disney have become known
for their sensitivity and awareness about

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.910
being politically correct.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.420
This year, for example, they've tried to tackle
the subject of racism quite admirably in Zootopia,

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.690
but other movies can't say the same.So, let's
take a look at ten offensively racist moments

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.949
in kids movies that you never noticed.

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.450
Despicable Me 2
Whilst still an enjoyable movie, Despicable

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.809
Me 2 didn't quite live up to its predecessor
for a number of reasons - and one of those

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.920
reasons is undoubtedly its portrayal of fairly
racist Mexican stereotypes.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.740
The movie's main villain Mexican - and he's
presented in quite an offensive way.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:15.479
An obese Mexican restaurant owner with a mustache
and a gold chain around his neck, "El Macho"

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.600
had a very thick accent and, when he spoke,
he sort of danced around in a way that suggested

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.850
the people behind the movie just assumed all
Latin people did that.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.740
Moreover, his son Antonio was presented as
an exaggerated version of the stereotypical

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.460
smooth "Latin lover" - and he even ended up
cheating on his love interest, Margo.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.520
Happy Feet
It's hard to imagine that a movie about penguins

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.890
could possibly be racially offensive to the
Latino community, but Happy Feet managed to

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.280
be exactly that.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.320
The Arctic in the movie had an area best described
as a "ghetto", where the supposed underclass

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.659
lived, that managed to incorporate pretty
much every racist Latino stereotype.

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.000
The late Robin Willams' character, Ramón,
was a prime example of this.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.250
There were bad Latino accents, words like
"Mami" and "homies" being thrown around, and

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.270
there were passionate Latin lovers.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.280
To be saying this about a movie made as recently
as 2006 is quite unforgivable.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.680
Fantasia
In the original release of this classic Disney

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.430
movie, there was a character included who
is now seen as being very a controversial

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.430
creation.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.700
“Sunflower” was a small, dark-skinned
centaur with braided hair who was a servant

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.150
to the larger, light-skinned, blonde and dainty
centaurs.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.580
The implications of black slaves working for
white people are obvious but, these days,

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.900
the scene has been removed from the movie,
so you won't see it without looking online

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.450
or into the archives.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.710
But it was definitely there back in the day
and it's a prime example of Disney being incredibly

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.080
racist.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.290
Dumbo
Dumbo is one of the cutest Disney characters

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.790
to ever grace the screen, and it's both difficult
and sad to say that his movie was tarnished

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.269
by some quite despicable racism.

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:01.180
For example, jet black crows appear in the
movie, one of whom is called "Jim Crow" - a

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.489
reference to the Jim Crow racial segregation
laws that existed in the USA until 1965.

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.500
There is also a scene that shows faceless
black men performing menial labour, whilst

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.379
singing songs about how they never learned
to read or write - that scene in particular

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:20.870
is arguably one of the most offensive and
cringeworthy movie scenes of all time.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.129
Song of the South
Disney have actually not allowed the sale

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:30.330
of Song of the South since the 1980s - it's
that unabashadly racist throughout.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:44.939
For starters, there is a character called
the "Tar-Baby", which is seen by many as a

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:46.629
derogatory term for African Americans.

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:47.870
The character is involved in a scene in which
he gets caught in a beehive and, on Disney's

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.610
Splash Mountain rides, Br'er rabbit is depicted
in the scene instead, as the character is

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.969
currently seen as being unsuitable for modern
viewing.

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:55.969
Another character in the movie, Uncle Remus,
is a black ex-slave who comforts another character

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:56.969
called Johnny with various tall tales about
mythical animals, who themselves are mostly

00:03:56.969 --> 00:03:57.969
terribly racist stereotypes.

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:01.121
Peter Pan
There's an extremely offensive racial stereotype

00:04:01.121 --> 00:04:05.340
in the Disney classic Peter Pan - and it relates
to Native Americans.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.790
Following Peter's rescuing of Princess Tiger
Lily, she takes him to meet her father - Big

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.319
Chief - and his tribe of “Indians.”

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.440
The tribe break out into song and that’s
where things start getting offensive.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:24.940
The song is called “What Makes the Red Man
Red?” and was meant to teach Peter and the

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.950
Lost Boys about Native Americans and their
culture but, in hindsight, it was very racist

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:35.570
indeed, and its lyrics suggested that their
skin was "red" because the first "Injun prince"

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.460
kissed a girl and it made him blush.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.420
Surely you agree that that's highly inappropriate.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.660
Lady and the Tramp
Lady and the Tramp has a couple of very racist

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.110
aspects, not least in the form of the movie's
cunning and sneaky villains, Si and Am.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:05:01.220
Si and Am are Siamese cats who are portrayed
with stereotypical Asian speech and, for want

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.750
of a better term, stereotypically slanted
eyes.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:10.100
They also move in complete symmetry and have
no individuality - as if suggesting that they're

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.440
"all the same" in that sickening old-fashioned
way.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:19.760
The movie also has Pedro, the chihuahua with
exaggerated Mexican attributes, but that's

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.190
not quite as bad.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.830
The Little Mermaid
In The Little Mermaid, there are a number

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.910
of problems regarding racist portrayals of
characters.

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:34.060
For example, Ariel's friend Sebastian the
crab has a Jamaican accent and advocated staying

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:39.830
"Under the Sea" because you don’t have to
get a job down there.

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.600
Disney really do have a terrible history of
portraying dark skinned people as being lazy,

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.160
which is absolutely awful.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.060
In addition to that, the Duke of Soul and
Blackfish characters are made to look and

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.290
sound like popular black musicians and singers
and are drawn with much more prominent and

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.970
plump lips than the other characters.

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.880
The Jungle Book
The Jungle Book features an abundance of great

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.840
and beloved characters, but there's something
inherently racist about a particular type

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.280
of animal in the movie.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.470
The society of apes in the movie were quite
obviously meant to demean black people.

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:16.320
They speak with African American accents and
sing about a desire to be human, with lyrics

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.310
describing how they want "to walk like you"
and "talk like you" - all of which had an

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:22.920
offensive minstrel show feel to it as well.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:27.030
In fact, the ape leader - King Louie - was
quite obviously modelled on legendary black

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:28.870
jazz musician Louie Armstrong.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:33.440
Thankfully, the live action 2016 remake of
the movie didn't make the same mistakes as

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.030
the classic version.

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:39.650
Aladdin
Aladdin is the only movie on this list in

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.830
which the lead character himself is actually
quite a racist creation.

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.870
In spite of the fact that Aladdin comes from
the same Arabic nation as the other Arab characters

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:55.910
who are portrayed as barbaric savages, he
is basicalled designed as a white character.

00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:00.430
Moreover, Jafar - the film's main villain
- is depicted with far more striking Arab

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:01.990
features than he is.

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:05.490
The movie is essentially saying that people
with Arabic appearances couldn't possibly

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:09.470
be portrayed as heroes, and that the more
Arabic in appearance a character is, the more

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.870
evil they are - which is absolutely horrific
when you think about it.

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:16.710
