Here's the answer, we're going to define is yummy within our restaurant class

00:00:04.668 --> 00:00:08.953
because it's a method it's going to take self as a parameter. We'll have a doc

00:00:08.953 --> 00:00:13.289
string that explains what it does. It returns true if this restaurant is yummy,

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:18.244
otherwise it returns false, and we'll define it to just return false. So that's

00:00:18.244 --> 00:00:20.269
all we need to do to create the is yummy method.
