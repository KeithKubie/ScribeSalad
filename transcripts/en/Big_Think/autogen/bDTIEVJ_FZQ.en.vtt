I should really research the origin of

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:10.880
I should really research the origin of
 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.769
I should really research the origin of
the 10% of the brain a meme which is

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:16.779
the 10% of the brain a meme which is
 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:22.030
the 10% of the brain a meme which is
wildly repeated in many places I don't

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:22.040
wildly repeated in many places I don't
 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.640
wildly repeated in many places I don't
know exactly what the original statement

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650
know exactly what the original statement
 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.450
know exactly what the original statement
was referring to but probably it was

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460
was referring to but probably it was
 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.480
was referring to but probably it was
referring to the fact that the neurons

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490
referring to the fact that the neurons
 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.700
referring to the fact that the neurons
in the brain the neurons in the cortex

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710
in the brain the neurons in the cortex
 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.900
in the brain the neurons in the cortex
of the brain a fire sparsely in the

of the brain a fire sparsely in the
 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.240
of the brain a fire sparsely in the
sense that they are not you know active

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250
sense that they are not you know active
 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.969
sense that they are not you know active
all the time sending electrical impulses

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:42.979
all the time sending electrical impulses
 

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:48.549
all the time sending electrical impulses
the the fire at much lower rates than

the the fire at much lower rates than
 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.109
the the fire at much lower rates than
their you know that they would be

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:53.119
their you know that they would be
 

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:57.399
their you know that they would be
capable of hardware wise and but this

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:57.409
capable of hardware wise and but this
 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:00:59.500
capable of hardware wise and but this
does not mean that they are not in use

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510
does not mean that they are not in use
 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.890
does not mean that they are not in use
all the time namely a neuron being

silent means something as opposed to not

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000
silent means something as opposed to not
 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.850
silent means something as opposed to not
meaning anything and therefore I I

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860
meaning anything and therefore I I
 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.890

really have no idea what it would mean

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900
really have no idea what it would mean
 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.130
really have no idea what it would mean
to say we are only using 10% of the of

to say we are only using 10% of the of
 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.100
to say we are only using 10% of the of
the brain a as far as I'm aware

everybody uses most of the brain most of
