00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.360
&gt;&gt; Ted Widmer: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.660
My name is Ted Widmer.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.330
I'm the brand new director of
the Kluge Center and really happy

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:26.630
to welcome all of you here.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.960
Some of you came a great distance.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.770
And it's an honor to host this
important event today organized

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.110
by Toyin Falola.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.260
I came from not all that far away.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.170
I came from the city of Providence,
Rhode Island where there is a small

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:48.040
but thriving Liberian community
and a growing abundance

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.120
of African restaurants, which
one of my sorrows at moving

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.440
to Washington is I don't know
the local restaurants as well

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.680
as I did where I come from.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.240
But in our old northeastern city,

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.610
this new immigrant population
constituted a really important

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.930
source of vitality.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.630
So we're all looking forward
to this conference today.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.020
And I want to thank Toyin
Falola for organizing it.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.030
I also want to pause briefly to
acknowledge my-- I joked yesterday,

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.090
my predecessor's predecessor's
predecessor's predecessor,

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.210
Carolyn Brown who is
here with us as well.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.710
The Kluge Center was created
with a gift in the year 2000

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.280
from John W. Kluge to
the Library of Congress.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.940
It's still the largest gift that
ever has come to the Library

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.750
of Congress and it is a center
for scholars doing research

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.940
and for public events
such as this one.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.610
And we're so grateful to have Toyin

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.870
in our community which
he is deeply in.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.820
He serves the Kluge
Center in many ways.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.350
He's on the Scholars Council

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.180
which is a very distinguished
board appointed by the librarian

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.940
of congress to give
advice on a range

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.970
of scholarly issues
to the librarian.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.000
But he's also very much
among us on a daily basis.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.300
He has an office down the hall.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.160
He comes to all of our events
and we're really grateful

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.510
to him personally, as
well as professionally

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.220
for all that he brings to us.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.760
Toyin is a professor
at University of Texas

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.550
and specifically he's the Jacob
and Frances Sanger Mossiker Chair

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.750
in the Humanities and University
Distinguished Teaching Professor

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.640
at UT Austin.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.330
He's also a fellow of the
Nigerian Academy of Letters,

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.650
a fellow of the Historical
Society of Nigeria,

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.620
the author of numerous books
including "Violence in Nigeria:

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.970
The Crisis of Religious
Politics and Secular Ideologies",

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.160
"the Power of African
Cultures", and "Nationalism

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.700
and African Intellectuals".

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.810
He's also the series
editor of "Rochester Studies

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.150
in African History and the
Diaspora" and the series editor

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.750
of "Global Africa" by
Routledge, and also series editor

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.090
of "African Histories and
Modernities" by Palgrave Macmillan.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.710
Actually as I continue to read,

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.180
I see he's series editors
of a few more.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.130
"Carolina Studies on
Africa and the Black World"

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.410
and "African Identities" with
Cambridge University Press

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.180
and he's the co-editor
of the "Journal

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.040
of African Economic History"
and the "Yoruba Studies Review".

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.710
And he is well known to
all of you here today

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.390
and he has personally
invited you here.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.360
So he is the person you
really should listen

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.670
to to get things underway.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.710
But I'm personally very happy to
introduce him and to thank him

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.160
for all he does for
the Kluge Center.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.510
So please welcome Toyin Falola.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.500
[ Applause ]

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.640
&gt;&gt; Toyin Falola: It's a
pleasure for me to be here.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.170
We've agreed as to how we are
going to divide the short time

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.800
that we have, five people,

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.540
encouraging each one to
speak for 25 minutes.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.480
Although Ken Harrow said he
will speak for 30 minutes.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.900
So that we can manage our time
efficiently, we will take questions

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:28.810
at the end because if we stop paper
by paper, we will run out of time.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:34.340
I have to follow the convention.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:40.890
As you can see, I am wearing
some of my tight shoes.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.830
And usually I'm supposed to bring
greetings to some of the kings

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:53.790
that I represent and greetings
from three of them as I usually do

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.010 position:56%
so as not to violate the convention.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:04.320
The long introduction of
the speakers is in the piece

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.260
that I took, so I'll be very brief.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.440
Starting with Ken Harrow
who has done a lot of work

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.650
on African cinema,
he has been teaching

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.210
at Michigan State for
a long, long time.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.840
And he's done so many major
books, including the latest one

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.100
by Indiana University
Press on "Trash:

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.850
The History of African
Cinemas Viewed From Below".

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:36.420 position:56%
He's very well known in the academy.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:45.170
And then we have Abdul Bangura
who speaks close to 20 languages

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:52.660
and is currently-- had in
Arabic, Hebrew, and hieroglyphics.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:57.570
He is extremely prolific
in languages and he serve

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:04.850
as a special envoy of the African
Union Peace and Security Council.

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.130
He is current successor
in this role.

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:14.270
I'm involved in the South Sudan
Peace Mission myself at the moment.

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:20.740
And he's done so many
books, so many articles,

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.670
and he's at the moment
researcher-in-residence

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:28.030
at the American University.

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:33.870
Then we have Nemata Blyden who
is in the History Department,

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:38.030
International Affairs and
Director of the Women's Program

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:42.310
at George Washington University.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.980
She's done a lot of work
on women in Liberia,

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.850
African and African diaspora.

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:54.360
She's lived in the Africa,
the Soviet Union and in the US

00:06:54.360 --> 00:07:02.480
as she brings all these locations
into bearing as she reflects

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.930
on a wide range of topics.

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:15.390
And then we have Moses Ochonu who
is a noted public intellectual.

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:20.400
He writes op-ed pieces on a very
regular basis at The Chronicle

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.660
of Higher Education,
the Time Magazine,

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.010
Global Post and many others.

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:35.360
And he's done three major
books, all very well respected,

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.790
including the finalist
for the Herskovits and is

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:45.490
at the moment working on
what Nigerian Muslims think

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:50.740
about Imperial Britain in the
first half of the 20th century.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.800
Please join me in welcoming
all of them.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.600
You want to take a seat?

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.450
[ Applause ]

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:00.890
Please come and take your seat.

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:02.620
Let me start.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:10.110
And my PowerPoint is
there but my interest

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:13.670
in this topic has expanded
very widely.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:22.860
And last year, when I gave
the usual presidential speech

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.370 position:56%
of the African Studies Association--

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:28.630
By the way, those of you who are
involved with the association,

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:31.120
one of the reasons why people
don't want to serve is because of

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:36.570
that speech, because it's
so difficult to write.

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:41.580
What I did was to map out how a
new discipline can emerge arising

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:43.160
from this topic.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:49.560
I was taking a lot of risk because
for that discipline to be created,

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:53.770
we have to fragment what
is called Black Studies

00:08:53.770 --> 00:09:01.540 position:56%
or fragment African-American
Studies and either drew an insertion

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:09.090
of the new field that I proposed
which was very well received.

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:15.200
Turn it into a separate self-field
on its own in the academy.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:21.170
And I have been-- like an onion,

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:25.440
I've been peeling this
project in various dimensions.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:32.670
And I ran into one of the Kluge
staff in the train one day

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:35.600
when I was going for an interview.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:42.380 position:56%
And since September, I've been doing
a lot of interviews in three states,

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.940
in Virginia, Baltimore and DC.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:48.840
I thought I'll be able
to report on this

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:53.410
but they're crunching all
this data for me in Austin.

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:56.950
But I've been able to
cover associations.

00:09:56.950 --> 00:10:00.050
I'm now on comfortable
ground talking

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:02.880
about immigrant associations.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:08.340
Unlike the big state of Texas, it's
so much easier to do research here

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:14.170
because of the density and the
nearness of all of the spaces.

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:20.030
And I'll be reporting on
this data in due course.

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:25.000
Is there a way I can
control it from here, sir?

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.310
&gt;&gt; The thing right next to you.

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:27.850
&gt;&gt; Toyin Falola: Where is it?

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:29.150
Oh, this one?

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:30.450
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:31.750
&gt;&gt; Toyin Falola: OK.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:38.910
So, I've been preceded in
this by a variety of scholars.

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:46.740
The trouble is that many of
them are based on conjectures,

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:54.420
in which they do personal
reflections.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:11:00.180
And the reason is the
options for quantitative data,

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:02.440
the options are very limited.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.000
We can rely on the
limited census data

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.350
by the federal government
that exists.

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:13.310 position:56%
And then we can do sample data which
we can collect from specific places

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:21.380
like in Western campuses
which I've done.

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:24.240
We can-- And for instance
we have figures

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:27.910
to say how many Africans
scholars at yield?

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:29.210
That is available.

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:30.810
That's not a problem.

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:33.480
Or how many, you know,
students that are white?

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.410
That one we can do.

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:41.030
Or we can do specific research and
we can just take a narrow topic

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:44.070
and then they answer
specific questions.

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:46.140
That we can do.

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:54.090
And then you have a variety
of official categorization

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:56.890
that we can follow up on.

00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:01.420
So, I've gone beyond those to do
what is called snowballing samples.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:07.590 position:56%
I've interviewed various
locations, Houston, Dallas, Chicago.

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:12.490 position:56%
I was to go to Minnesota this summer
but it didn't work out because if--

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:18.310
I do not know how many of you are
following this story which a number

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:22.610
of people from Somalia, some young
people, there are four of them,

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:25.280
who are arrested for joining ISIS.

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:27.500
And the community became very angry

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:33.830
that some members reveal
the identity of these kids,

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:41.460
and there's a lot of tension
on that to cancel that project.

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:46.540
So in doing snowballing
samples, there's no time for me

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:52.060
to explain these limitations but it
has been very effective in trying

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:59.840
to see how a new set of data
can compliment existing ones.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.600
Here are the problems.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:10.330
We have double counting, double
counting in which children born

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:15.070
in the US and children born in
Africa, parent's identification

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:17.730
of children's nationality
are very complicated.

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:23.950
And double counting in so
many snowballing samples,

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:29.510
the percentage is very high,
and also self-identification.

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:31.600
By self-identification I mean

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:37.730
that somebody can say she's
American but she's also Nigerian.

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:44.690
And accounting for that
self-identification is

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:46.310
very difficult.

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:51.290
Even universities, it
has been very difficult.

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:55.720
Part of the complication is
issues around dual citizenship,

00:13:55.720 --> 00:14:00.120
in which a person like
me, I carry two passports.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.140
When I'm leaving the US
I use Nigerian passport,

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:05.890
when I'm coming back
I use the US passport.

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:10.460
And sometimes I have a third one
which is a diplomatic passport.

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:18.630 position:56%
So, that notion of dual citizenship,
whether it's a federal census

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:23.190
or the ACLS, has created
its own complications.

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:27.900
Then you have the tendency
for naturalized Americans

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:32.210
to also call themselves
Africans so that this--

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:36.960
it disconnect both in
the official figures.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:41.070
I know that figures between
citizenship by birth,

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:46.050
citizenship by naturalization,
and what people see.

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:50.420
Then you have how ethnicities
define itself.

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:56.070
In many African ethnicities, you
claim the birth place of your dad.

00:14:56.070 --> 00:15:02.900 position:56%
So if you are to go to an American
campus and you run to a negro person

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:07.670
who has never left the US,
the student may tell you he

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:10.590
or she is evil but he has never--

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:13.430
he or she may not have
left the country.

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:16.100
That's not uncommon.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:22.880
And those complications
make it extremely difficult

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:26.970
to use many of these samples.

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:35.270 position:56%
In Dallas this summer, I was looking
at kids who got into drug problems,

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:41.430 position:56%
and parents who are trying to adjust
the citizenship definition based

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:44.050
on another variable of shame.

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:48.220
So, then you have-- which you have

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:52.540
for all immigrant populations
undocumented labor.

00:15:52.540 --> 00:16:00.090
So if we go by official figures,
this is the US figures now.

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:09.910
And they tend to be lower than
what alternative sources tell us.

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:21.600
In 1960, 33,000 Africans, in 1970,
80,000, we need to put that 1%

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:25.850
of the total population,
and in 2007, 1.4 million.

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:30.950
The figure expanded in
the '70s for two reasons.

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:40.990
First, preference expanded as
people began to come to the US.

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:46.490 position:56%
People who used to come to the US do
so because they can speak English.

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:49.950
And they tend to go to
former colonial masters.

00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:51.880
People in Angola will
go to Portugal.

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:54.380 position:56%
People in Senegal will go to France.

00:16:54.380 --> 00:17:01.020
That's very common because if
language is a problem in migration,

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:05.100
if you can't speak the
language, it's difficult--

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:09.770
adjustments become difficult
and insertion becomes difficult.

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:15.820
But as European economy
enters into this problem,

00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:17.780
they began to come
here in large number.

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.000
So today, for instance, at Harlem,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.340
there were a large
number of Senegalese.

00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:24.680 position:56%
They've created a Senegalese colony.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:29.520
And then you have the crisis in the
'80s in Liberia, Ethiopia, Somalia

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:32.970
and Sudan, special
category of asylum.

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:37.300
And in this special category
of asylum, more Africans came,

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:42.400
and in this asylum, they
changed the dynamics of location.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.250
We know those who come voluntarily,
where they stay in the US.

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:48.030
But with respect to asylum,

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:50.160
the federal government
dictates where they go.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.680
So that's why you now
find Africans in Dakota.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.840
On their own they won't
go to Dakota.

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.570
It's just not going
to work for them.

00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:03.570
So by 2022, according to
the US federal figures,

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:07.800
there'll be 3 million
Africans living in the country.

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.360
Is that a big number?

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.870
Well, some people would say
it's a small number relative

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:17.110
to the rest of them, foreign bond.

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:19.350
We've been able also
to break distance

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:21.930
down into where people come from.

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:28.330
With West Africa, having
almost 29%, Northern Africa 17,

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:36.120
Eastern Africa following
and then North Africa.

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:42.060 position:56%
And the largest populations are from
Nigeria and Ghana, Ethiopia, Kenya,

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:44.740
Somalia and East Africa and Egypt.

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:51.440
We're able to know where people
come from and the various numbers

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:58.840
in terms of-- And we're also able
to know where they go to, New York,

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:03.780
Washington, DC, Atlanta, Los
Angeles, Minneapolis-Saint Paul.

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:08.090
These have the highest
numbers of people.

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:14.670
And then you have them
Columbus, Ohio, Baltimore,

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:17.380
Providence, Rhode Island.

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:24.670
And we can discuss what this
means in terms of what they do.

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:28.620
There are variations in
some of these numbers,

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:32.620
as you find the higher number
of Ethiopians in Dallas.

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:35.840
And you have a large
number of Ghanaians

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.510
in Chicago, Columbus and New York.

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:41.650
Then we have the Cape
Verdeans in Providence.

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:48.590
And you have a lot of, in DC, a
lot of Ethiopians and Nigerians.

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:51.620
And in Minneapolis you
have Somalian, Egyptian.

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:58.050
LA and San Francisco, they were
from Egypt, Nigeria and Ethiopia

00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:03.490
and then when-- This
population is highly educated,

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:05.050
extremely highly educated.

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:11.010
When we draw in the asylum seekers,
we-- you find them in North Dakota,

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:15.820
Minnesota, South Dakota, Maryland,
and the District of Columbia.

00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:21.130
And the advantage of this is that
it makes research much easier

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:24.610
and it makes snowballing easier.

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:31.420
As we do some of this
research, we begin to find how--

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:33.320
My eyes is not very good.

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:36.710
I can't see the PowerPoint.

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:46.630
We begin to find how there's a lot
of disconnect in the literature.

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:52.650
The reason why people migrate is
similar to why Italians migrates

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:56.790
to what are the-- why the
people migrate, but we have a 3%

00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:59.530
that does not conform
to any of this data.

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:02.900
In other words, they are not
migrating for political reasons,

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:07.370
they are not political exiles
and they're not spending money

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:10.520
that they make in the US.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:15.400
Rather, they are spending the
money that they made abroad.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:23.990
So that represent doesn't
plug into the narratives.

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:30.200
As of today we have tremendous data
to support to our broad topics.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:35.880
We now have solid data or
movements of a time between Africa

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:43.730
and the West, including Europe,
and most recently Eritrea.

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:46.670
Not the tie is pretty
well established.

00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:52.970 position:56%
And the European Union is also very
good in giving us a new set of data.

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:58.140
And then we have data about
adjustment on political exiles,

00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:01.430
ethnic and religious associations.

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:06.150
We now have close ties
on Pentecostalism.

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:11.820 position:56%
As a rising force, we now have solid
data on Pentecostalism, on Islam,

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:14.000
which Abdul will be talking about.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:21.970 position:56%
Occupations and entrepreneurship and
how immigrants call us are trying

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:26.250
to frame a variety of topics.

00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:33.050
Then we have data that do
not conform to what we find

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:34.870
in established literature.

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:40.250
One of the data that
doesn't conform is I believe

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:45.220
in immigration literature that
it's poor people who migrate.

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:48.760
The data from Western and Central
Africa is telling us the opposite,

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:52.390
that it's people with
resources who migrate.

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:55.820 position:56%
That's not what we teach in schools.

00:22:55.820 --> 00:23:01.670
It is the children of parents
with money, or people with money

00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:05.490
who actually tend to migrate.

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:12.110
And we also are beginning
to have data on education

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:24.870
and it's frightening in terms
of how US figure and sample data

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:31.040
in Baltimore by federal
government officials conclude

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:35.800
that African immigrants
are the highest educated.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.700
That's what the data is saying.

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:43.310
Well there's a disconnect between
job satisfaction and education.

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:48.890
And almost 40% say that
they are not very happy.

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:51.520
And the reason has
to do with the fact

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:55.570
that many cannot relate their
diplomas to the jobs they do.

00:23:55.570 --> 00:24:01.230
So there's a disconnect,
and a very large percentage.

00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:07.890
When as you take Uber or you take a
taxi, you will notice that for many

00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:10.370
of those African immigrants,
they already have degrees,

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:16.140
PhD statistics, MA chemistry,
and that disconnect is well

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:22.940
in a wide range of our
society and complain

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:28.510
that although they are
educated they are not happy.

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:34.690 position:56%
Then you have what we did not expect
to find in snowballing samples,

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:42.660 position:56%
which is that migration is framed as
an alternative to home conditions.

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:45.810
But a large percentage says
that they made a mistake.

00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:48.670
We're not expecting to find that.

00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:51.710
We're expecting to say that they're
happy that they've left Ghana

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:58.290
or Sierra Leone, but that's not
what we've been able to find.

00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:02.020
And we've been asking the
questions, why are they sad,

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:08.170
why are they not very
happy with this issue?

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:12.740
And there are so many answers,

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:15.220
but two of which are
very important issues

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:17.540 position:56%
around what I call cultural capital.

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:20.200
What is it that you have
before you come here?

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:23.220
And issues are on social prestige.

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:28.320
Values of social prestige
are not universal.

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:31.940
For instance, it was when I got
to the US that I washed a car

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:33.760
for the first time in my life.

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:37.640
A professor doesn't wash
cars where I come from.

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:43.270
Nobody does that, because of
the higher social prestige

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:44.830
of the professor.

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:49.500
What you call a business card, I
can write a note at the back of it

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:51.600
and it will give you a job.

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:55.450
Not here. That's why I
don't carry one anymore

00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:59.500
because I quickly realize
that it's just an address.

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:02.620
It's just to say I'm in Austin.

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:05.860
It's not tied to issues
around prestige.

00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:12.580
And you find and later in Dallas
and Houston how they've been trying

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:15.940
to recreate those notions
of social prestige.

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:19.410
I once attended a party
as part of this research

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:23.180
and with the celebrant came into
the hall with a white horse.

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:32.630 position:56%
So, we find that that is problematic
in terms of what the host think

00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:37.720
about them and what they
think about themselves.

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:44.100
And then you find the bigger
issue, do you want to go back and--

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:47.890
I'm skipping because
I'm running out of time.

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:52.720
And we have the percentage
of those who go back.

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:56.480
Very quickly, here's
what is going on.

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:59.600
We've been able to track those
who go back and been able

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:02.200
to track them to where they go to.

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:06.860
But the percentages who comes
back, and there's a distinction

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:11.680
which is very clearly
reflected between men and women.

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.980
More men want to go back to Africa.

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:16.140
Most women don't want to go back.

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:21.300
And the decisive answer
is tied to patriarchy.

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:25.470
Because in many times laws
and divorce regulations,

00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:29.220
they are very different, although
some countries in South Africa

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:35.410
and Kenya are beginning to
revise many of these regulations.

00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:38.730
But for most of Africa,
the women don't want

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:44.560
to go back, which is very clear.

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:49.430
When we collect all these
data, there are a number

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:53.530
of theoretical paradigms that we
have to reflect upon and shift some

00:27:53.530 --> 00:27:55.140
of the existing arguments.

00:27:55.140 --> 00:28:00.120
For many of you who have read
for instance "Things Fall Apart",

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:03.770
"Ambiguous Adventure",
and many of the classics

00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:09.350
in the African writing series,
the trope is that of alienation.

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:13.990
And it's very well established,
but that has to be modified,

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:18.130
because this trope of
alienation is no longer useful.

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:23.480
There is a-- we have to
look for another explanation

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:27.250
because that longstanding
literature--

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:32.760
and I'm sure maybe Ken Harrow
is going to disagree with this--

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:35.760
is no longer working with this
set of African immigrants.

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:40.600
Today, you can live in DC and
not watch American television

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:43.040
for the rest of your life.

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:45.330
You can watch Nigerian
television station.

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:47.770
You don't have to watch Hollywood.

00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:50.410
You can watch Nollywood.

00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:54.280
So you don't have to put
hamburger in your mouth

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.070
for the rest of your life.

00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:59.030
You can just eat your
food as a Ghanaian.

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:01.780
They sell them here.

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:03.820
Just as the director
said about restaurants,

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:06.810
there's so many restaurants,
African restaurants here,

00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:11.010
Cameroonian restaurant, Ghanaian
restaurants, Nigerian restaurants.

00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:18.850
So you can get your cassava and yam
and you can communicate rapidly.

00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:21.730
So, we have to change our concept.

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:23.820
What do we call them?

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:26.640
I think they are more
like transnationalists

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.800
because of the heavy traffic.

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:32.780
You still can go to Ghana
tonight if you have the money.

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:36.020
And because they are
transnationalists,

00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:41.080
we have to find a way to reframe
some of the arguments on the table.

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:44.910
Then you have two contentions,
one back to the [inaudible]

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:52.690
on cosmopolitanism and it's
been advancing this project.

00:29:52.690 --> 00:30:00.710
And [inaudible] has connected
more with people in this part

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:05.040
of the world and his argument is
don't walk with people in Africa.

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:08.830
His cosmopolitan argument
has been very problematic

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:10.460
on the African side.

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:16.250
And then you have issues
around Afropolitanism

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:21.030
in which a new generation is
now working within the paradigm

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:24.290
of nationalism of Du
Bois [inaudible].

00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:30.420 position:56%
They're working with another set of
nationalism, [inaudible] and others,

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:36.310 position:56%
[inaudible] the musician, redefining
the notion of Africa based

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:39.450
on the space that they occupy here.

00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:42.520
So we are at the frontier
of a new topic

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:46.510
and I'm sure my colleagues was--

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:50.580
I've just done some
small introduction to it

00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:54.640
and there was plus some of
these in greater detail.

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:58.080
Let me call on our second speaker.

00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:59.970
Nemata, yeah, you're next, right?

00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:01.740
Yes. Is it?

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:03.040
&gt;&gt; Moses Ochonu: Moses.

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.340
&gt;&gt; Toyin Falola: It's Moses.

00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:05.640
OK, Moses.

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:06.940
&gt;&gt; Moses Ochonu: Thank you.

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:08.740
&gt;&gt; Toyin Falola: Thank you.

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:11.830
[ Applause ]

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:15.070
Yes. And do you have a PowerPoint?

00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:16.370
&gt;&gt; Moses Ochonu: Yes, I have.

00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:17.670
&gt;&gt; Toyin Falola: OK.

00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:18.970
I couldn't see.

00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:20.580
My eyes are bad.

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:24.300
I can't see.

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:28.360
&gt;&gt; Moses Ochonu: I want
to thank Professor Falola

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:30.660
for inviting me to this event.

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:36.240 position:56%
And I want to also thank the Library
of Congress, the Board of Scholars

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.940
for extending this invitation.

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:40.550
And I want to thank you
guys for taking time

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:44.340
out of your busy schedules
to be part of this event.

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:52.980
I am deeply implicated in what we
are here to discuss, obviously.

00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:54.280
I'm an immigrant myself.

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:58.230
And as Professor Falola was
going through his slides,

00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:00.910
I could see myself in
some of those slides.

00:32:00.910 --> 00:32:02.600
I could see myself in
some of those slides,

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:08.700
so it'll be really interesting to
sit up here and try to reflect.

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:10.220
It's almost like what they used

00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:12.700
to call self-study,
right, in those days.

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:15.970
And, you know, when I was
in grad school they said,

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:19.580
my professors warned
me, don't do self-study.

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:21.380
Don't study yourself.

00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:26.870
So, but I'm here this-- to talk
about why Africans come to America.

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:30.420
It's a pretty self-explanatory
title for the talk.

00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:36.260
I don't have all the answers but
my aim is to raise some questions,

00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:42.010
some of which actually I
think piggyback on the points

00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:44.170
that Professor Falola
raised earlier.

00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:46.180
So I'm going to raise those
questions with regards

00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:49.650
to motivations, what
motivates Africans to come

00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:52.980
to migrate to the United States.

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:55.810
And I'll raise those
questions and I'll put

00:32:55.810 --> 00:33:00.670
on the table some tentative answers
that we can talk about in the Q&amp;A.

00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:01.970
All right.

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:07.530
So, the classic African migration
story has been told in the idiom

00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:12.980
of economic [inaudible] and of
destitution and displacement.

00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:16.080
Many scholars and observers
advance economic pressure

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:19.400
and other involuntary
factors as the primary drivers

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:24.380
of African migratory itineraries,
especially when the migration is

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:27.330
from Africa to Euro-America.

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:33.200
In this spring, African migrants
in America are economic refugees.

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:37.910
Voluntary strategic migration
to America is often buried

00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:41.840
under this paradigm of
forced exile and escape

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:45.520
from imminent death or destitution.

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:49.260
This overarching motive of economic
and personal danger is extended

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:52.560
to African professionals who
relocates to America as part

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:54.790
of what's called as--

00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:58.410
have lamentably called
the African brain drain.

00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:02.100
It is also applied to an
increasingly strategic

00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:06.750
and voluntary group of
African migrants to America,

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:11.090
Africans whose migration
stories hardly conform or fitting

00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:15.020
to the familiar paradigm of
escape and economic desperation.

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:19.640
On the line that notion that
Africans are migrating away

00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:22.640
from their continent
for economic refuge

00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:25.030
in America is an understanding
of Africa--

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:29.720
African migration as a novel
phenomenon, or as a new phenomenon,

00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:34.200
a modern event threatening the
demographic and economic fates

00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:38.050
of both the origin and
destination of such migration.

00:34:38.050 --> 00:34:41.770
It is sustained-- This idea is--

00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:45.890
This belief or this argument is
sustained by illusion of Africans

00:34:45.890 --> 00:34:50.220
as traditionally on adventures, and
people who can only be separated

00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:54.620
from their homelands by
existential pressures.

00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:59.290
The truth, however, is that much
as African migration to America

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:03.430 position:56%
and other countries of the global
note has accelerated in recent times

00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:08.000
and has indeed been affected or
induced by economic collapse,

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.630
dysfunction and crisis,
voluntary migration

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:16.290
to far-flung lands has always been
a defining social characteristic

00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:18.040
of African societies.

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:20.120
And I'm a historian.

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:24.420
I should know this, and we can
talk about this more in the Q&amp;A.

00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:30.000
This voluntary strategic migration
has often occurred alongside

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.160
involuntary ones.

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:35.740
But it has often been
overshadowed by stories of dramatic

00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:39.840
and violent removal
or escape from Africa.

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:43.110
Given this backdrop, I would
like to introduce and argue

00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:46.820
and alternative thesis of
African migration to American.

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:51.390
One that will I argue become even
more relevant in the coming decades

00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:53.140
as the mobility of skilled

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:58.060
and talented workers increasingly
defy international borders.

00:35:58.060 --> 00:36:02.550
This thesis may not explain
the majority of cases

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:06.540
of African migration to America but
it is increasingly proven useful

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:10.250
as a way to understand newer
generations of migrants.

00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:12.670
My thesis here is quite simple.

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:17.090
There is a motivational shift
occurring in the familiar story

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:19.450
of African migration to America.

00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:24.180
It shift away from the
economic refugee paradigm.

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:28.560
African migrations to America
are not always attributable

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.760
to economic reasons.

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:36.630
An increasing number of African
immigrants resist this category

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:39.770
of economic refugee.

00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:42.110
They resist the category
of economic refugee.

00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:48.170
More and more Africans self-- more
and more Africans, self-selected

00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:51.680
and well-educated are relocating
to America from their homelands

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:57.160
in Africa not to escape poverty
or danger, but for adventure

00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:02.270
and the pursuit of intangible
psychosocial conveniences.

00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:06.890
This migratory process outside the
refugee paradigm has been going

00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:09.840
on for a long time and has
been growing in proportion

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:12.270
to the overall growth
in African migration

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:14.930
to America in recent decades.

00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:18.570
Yet, it has gone unrecognized
because of the long terms

00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:21.950
on the part of Americans
and Africans alike

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:27.710
to highlight migratory motivations
outside of the refugee frame work.

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:30.700
These were long terms to see
the African migrant outside

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:36.790
of the refugee narrative stems from
multiple factors, I would argue.

00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:40.480
The trope of refuge and
induced exile sustains

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:46.850
for many Americans the avuncular
humanitarian gaze on Africans.

00:37:46.850 --> 00:37:50.280
It enables them to assume
that self-defining position

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:53.940
of helper, nurturer and savior.

00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:57.810
Americans' sense of their
paternal mission works only

00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:01.180
by imagining the African
migrant as someone in need

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:05.160
of American paternal attention.

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:08.990
Paternalistic American attitudes
towards African immigrants walk

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:12.780
better when the migrant
is theorized as a refugee

00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:14.950
and as a displaced hopeless

00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:20.490
and helpless basket case needing
the help of good natured Americans.

00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:24.820
For Africans, including migrants,
sustaining the refugee narrative

00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:29.130
and suppressing migratory stories
outside of it is a strategic effort

00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:34.660
to leverage the humanitarian
"White savior complex" of Americans

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:40.450
to obtain empathy, legalization
and access to resources in America.

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:47.140
The logical endpoint of my argument
about recognizing the importance

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:49.600
of psychosocial motivations
is simple.

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:53.610
Africans are not very different
from other peoples of the world,

00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:56.780
and this is a point that
Professor Falola made earlier.

00:38:56.780 --> 00:39:00.340
Like Europeans, Americans,
Asians, and others,

00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:03.420
Africans do not migrate
only because of poverty,

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:06.090
hardship destitution
and helplessness.

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:10.710 position:56%
They also migrate because migrations
sometimes make you feel better

00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:12.010
about yourself.

00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:16.340
Sometimes migration is,
to put it quite simply,

00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:20.750
its own justification,
its own reward.

00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:24.000
It satisfies an innate
human psychosocial desire

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.610
to explore the unfamiliar,
the other,

00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:30.610
the distant, and the different.

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:33.030
For those who could
afford to migrate or those

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:36.360
who can afford migration, spend
in a lifetime in one corner

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:38.670
of the world is unappealing.

00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:43.030
Many Africans are in this category
and their story is quite important.

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:46.140
Well, this story goes untold
because there's little appetite

00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:48.450
for it in the West, in America.

00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:54.140
To advance an alternative thesis
of African migration to America,

00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:57.850
especially one that embraces a
more universal generic motivation

00:39:57.850 --> 00:40:03.050
for migration is to make a larger
argument about racial essentialism.

00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:06.000
It is to argue against
the notion that biological

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.370
and genetic signatures
confer innate,

00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:13.010
inescapable socio-behavioral
propensities

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:17.160
that differentiate Africans from
Euro-Americans in a fundamental way

00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:20.250
and make their migration
stories different.

00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:24.910
To be sure, my thesis is not a
disavowal of the obvious economic

00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:28.320
and existential stimuli
driving African migration

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:29.840
to the United States.

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:34.570 position:56%
Rather, I'm trying here to
synthesize the economic push factors

00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:39.750
on the idea that migration is also
a quest for psychosocial relief.

00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:44.080
If we must account for the range of
motivations for African migration

00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:48.990 position:56%
to America in the 21st century, we
have to embrace an explanatory model

00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:52.760
that recognizes the obvious
economic motivations,

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:55.620
as well as the increasingly
significant factor

00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:58.860
of convenient relocation.

00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:02.740 position:56%
One does not have to discount one
factor in order to stress the other.

00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:04.510
The psychosocial factors

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:09.040
that influence some African
migratory decisions are not removed

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:13.650
from issues of poverty and
economic alienation either.

00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:16.690
In fact, I would argue that
there is a symbiotic relationship

00:41:16.690 --> 00:41:20.790
between the economy of suffering
and the psychosocial quest

00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:25.070
that I am trying to
enunciate in this paper.

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:29.280
Psychosocial longings are sometimes
coextensive, I would argue,

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:33.570
with poverty, although, albeit
a different kind of poverty.

00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:37.450
And I'll talk about this
different kind of poverty shortly.

00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:38.750
It is obvious that poverty

00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:41.930
and economic destitution make
people want to move to places

00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:43.680
of perceived economic opportunity.

00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:46.000
This is quite obvious.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.140
It doesn't have to be explained.

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:50.030
But if we define poverty
and hardship,

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:53.470
not only in starkly economic
terms but also in terms

00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:58.310
of what one may call the quality of
life poverty, then it is possible

00:41:58.310 --> 00:42:01.790
to see how an economically
successful African professional

00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:06.800
in Africa could be poor in terms
of the quality of his or her life.

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:11.950
For analytical convenience,
let me call this kind

00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:15.220
of poverty psychosocial poverty.

00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:22.650 position:56%
OK? This kind of poverty is also an
impetus for migration out of Africa,

00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:26.560
for migration to America.

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:31.230
What I am positing here is what
one may call vicarious poverty,

00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:34.570
a situation in which
there will be migrant,

00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:38.730
migrant African does not experience
poverty directly but indirectly

00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:42.890
through the trauma of living in
the midst of grinding poverty

00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:47.310
and of being assaulted daily by the
reminders and images of poverty,

00:42:47.310 --> 00:42:51.780
economic collapse, infrastructural
deficits, and so forth.

00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:54.450
The psychological torture and
burden of such an environment

00:42:54.450 --> 00:43:01.010
of poverty can be as depressing
as actual personal poverty itself.

00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:03.930
There are two aspects
to this phenomenon.

00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:06.540
The first one revolves
around the fact

00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:11.830 position:56%
that no matter how successful one is
in Africa, one still has to depend

00:43:11.830 --> 00:43:15.750 position:56%
to various degrees on state-provided
social services, among them;

00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:19.140
electricity, water,
sewage, roads and security.

00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:24.180
As we know or as we should
know, these services are poor

00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:26.120
in many African countries.

00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:29.750
So, one is forced to participate
in the broader experience

00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:32.210
of poverty and underdevelopment.

00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:36.250
One's economic success cannot
insulate one from this.

00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:40.330
Your quality of life will therefore
be poor and may motivate you

00:43:40.330 --> 00:43:44.000
to migrate to America or another
country in the Global North

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.060
where social services are
delivered more efficiently.

00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:51.150 position:56%
In other words, there is a limit to
the amount of comfort and material--

00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:55.660
that material success can
confer on you in Africa.

00:43:55.660 --> 00:44:00.050
The second aspect has to do with
the ironic psychosocial trauma

00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:01.950
of being successful in Africa.

00:44:01.950 --> 00:44:06.320 position:56%
In Africa, more so than in the West,

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:10.310
the successful professional is
confronted daily by sights, sounds,

00:44:10.310 --> 00:44:13.340
and smells of acute poverty.

00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:16.060
He is surrounded and
tortured by this poverty.

00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:19.680
He sees it in his employees or
colleagues, junior colleagues,

00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:24.500
neighbors, relatives, friends, and
coreligionists, as well as kinsmen.

00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:28.590
On his daily commute to work, his
sense of accomplishments is diluted

00:44:28.590 --> 00:44:32.080
and deflated by disturbing and
haunting images of destitution

00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:33.900
and economic hopelessness.

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:38.460
These images nibble at his edifice
of-- at this edifice of success,

00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:41.750
filling him at once with
guilt and anxieties,

00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:45.440
and about what might have
been and what might still be.

00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:48.710
The images erode the
joys of economic success

00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:50.010
and make lofty economic

00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:55.060
and professional perches seem less
secure than they actually are.

00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:59.590
Insecurities, anxieties, guilt,
alienation, dissatisfaction,

00:44:59.590 --> 00:45:02.760
and depression take a toll
on the quality of one's life.

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:06.790
I would argue that not a
few successful Africans,

00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:10.570
economically successful
Africans, have migrated to America

00:45:10.570 --> 00:45:13.220
to escape this quality
of life conundrum,

00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:15.320
this unspoken existential turmoil

00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:19.670
that hunts successful
professionals in Africa.

00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:24.860 position:56%
The paradox of being psychologically
miserable even while being

00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:28.680
materially successful allows the
African professional to migrate

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:32.290
to America, not to escape
poverty, I would argue,

00:45:32.290 --> 00:45:35.110
or to survive economically
but to escape mentally

00:45:35.110 --> 00:45:38.490
and improve his quality of life in
the psychosocial sense of the word.

00:45:38.490 --> 00:45:42.880
What the migrant is escaping
is a kind of poverty,

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:45.210
a different kind of poverty.

00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:48.820
Not the poverty portrayed by
CNN or National Geographic

00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:52.510
or in Hollywood movies, right?

00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:55.610
So, increasingly, we are talking

00:45:55.610 --> 00:46:00.870
about strategic migrants
and strategic migration.

00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:05.610
Many of today's African migrants to
America are most strategic migrants

00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:07.650
than they are economic
refugees, I would argue.

00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:11.090
This is a not radical
statement to make actually

00:46:11.090 --> 00:46:14.290
since African migrants are
generally well-educated,

00:46:14.290 --> 00:46:17.740
even though the findings from
Professor Falola's work is--

00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:21.200
complicates that argument
a little bit.

00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:24.180
But generally, they
are very well-educated.

00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:27.140
There are arguments that they
are also self-selected, right?

00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:29.880
And strategically mobile,
people who are chosen

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:31.860
to be strategically mobile.

00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:34.870
Whether they are beneficiaries
of the US Visa Lottery program

00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:39.230
or students who came here to study,
like myself, or professionals

00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:42.830
who came here to take up positions
in US firms and institutions,

00:46:42.830 --> 00:46:47.120
many African migrants to the United
States increasingly do not fit

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:51.670
into the refugee-- the
refuge and exile paradigm.

00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:55.850
Instead, they are a
pre-selected, relatively privileged

00:46:55.850 --> 00:46:59.440
and prepared collection of
people who, for the most part,

00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:02.090
were already set apart
to varying degrees

00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:06.120
in their home countries prior
to their migration to America.

00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:08.040
There are people who
are not representative

00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:11.290
of the general populations
of their countries.

00:47:11.290 --> 00:47:16.060
Their migrant itineraries and
biographies undermine the concept

00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:21.150 position:56%
which so many of you have heard, the
concept of model minority, right?

00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:25.930 position:56%
This prior preparation and privilege
rarely makes it into the scholarly

00:47:25.930 --> 00:47:30.300
and popular discussions of
African migration to America.

00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:34.150
Studies on African migration to the
United States rarely acknowledge,

00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:37.200
let alone illuminate
this growing phenomenon

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:41.460
of psychosocial strategic migrants.

00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:44.730
This phenomenon has grown
and will continue to account

00:47:44.730 --> 00:47:46.860
for more African migration
to America

00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:50.380
in the coming years given
the continued growth

00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:54.170
of the African middle class in
the midst of expanding populations

00:47:54.170 --> 00:47:58.770
of poor people on crumbling
infrastructure.

00:47:58.770 --> 00:48:03.250
This dynamic of middle class
expansion, deepening poverty

00:48:03.250 --> 00:48:06.570
and deteriorating infrastructure,
I would argue,

00:48:06.570 --> 00:48:08.400
is key to understanding the rise

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:11.690
of strategic African
migration to America.

00:48:11.690 --> 00:48:16.390
This migratory flow caused
by psychosocial alienation

00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:20.240
and yearning for-- yearning, as
well as a systemic-- systematic--

00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:24.270 position:56%
systemic poverty and infrastructural
collapse, is likely to continue

00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:29.020
as corporations and institutions in
the United States aggressively seek

00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:33.300
out talent without regard to the
north-south dichotomies of old.

00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:40.700
We already see that African
professionals in multiple fields,

00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:43.920
some of them with experience
in multinational corporations

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:45.650
on the African side are take--

00:48:45.650 --> 00:48:48.410
increasingly taking
positions in the global note

00:48:48.410 --> 00:48:49.730
and relocating with their families.

00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:53.350
I have-- actually I have friends
who used to work in these--

00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:55.610
some of these multinational
companies back home who have--

00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:59.070
who are doing very well, much
better than I am doing in America

00:48:59.070 --> 00:49:03.400 position:56%
but who nonetheless chose to migrate
with their families to America.

00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:06.060
This is happening increasingly.

00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:09.640
So, my argument is then that
we need a new vocabulary,

00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:14.320
a new conceptual idiom to
explain the migratory choices

00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:17.680
of these new African
migrants and to tell--

00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:21.930 position:56%
to be able to tell their stories
alongside the other stories as well.

00:49:21.930 --> 00:49:25.940
In the African immigrant's
journey to--

00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:30.780
If the African immigrant's journey
to America is a manifestation

00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:37.690
of his efforts to make--
to take control of his life

00:49:37.690 --> 00:49:41.530 position:56%
and destiny while escaping the
conditions that diminish the quality

00:49:41.530 --> 00:49:43.670 position:56%
of his life in Africa, the processes

00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:46.700
that make the journey
possible are shaped by forces

00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:50.130
and narratives beyond his
or her control in America.

00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:55.260
The African-- beyond his
or her control in America.

00:49:55.260 --> 00:49:58.760
But these forces are also
available to him to manipulate.

00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:02.050
Furthermore, once he
is situated in America,

00:50:02.050 --> 00:50:06.040
the African immigrant's life and
choices are no longer his own.

00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:08.670
Rather, they are shaped
by the circumstances

00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:12.660
and ideological positions
produced by the political dynamics

00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:15.720 position:56%
and the politics of
self-fashioning in American society.

00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:17.900
Both the migratory process

00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:23.040
and the way the migrant narrates
his experience are then constrained

00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:27.150
and reshaped by preexisting
discursive regimes in America,

00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:30.450
which perhaps explains why
in spite of the increase

00:50:30.450 --> 00:50:34.250
in professional migrations,
strategic migrations from Africa,

00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:37.470
the migration as economic
escape paradigm continues

00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:39.850
to dominate perspective
and discussions

00:50:39.850 --> 00:50:42.660
on African migration
to the United States.

00:50:42.660 --> 00:50:46.590
This dissonance between the
complexity of the African story

00:50:46.590 --> 00:50:50.920
of migration to America and its
simplistic reduction to story

00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:54.410
of suffering and rescue
should be explained.

00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:59.470
So, I return now to
my earlier question.

00:50:59.470 --> 00:51:04.480
Why is the economic refugee
exile paradigm so persistent?

00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:08.500
Why does it seem to overshadow
the increasing phenomenon

00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:12.010
of African strategic
migration to the United States?

00:51:12.010 --> 00:51:15.230
I want to conclude by offering
a few tentative answers

00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:17.270
to these questions.

00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:21.950
The paternalistic racial attitude
of Western Liberals construct

00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:26.020
and legitimize certain migratory
stereotypes, I would argue.

00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:31.110
It also privileges and silences
certain migratory narratives

00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:36.460 position:56%
and cause African migrants to become
active participants in this process

00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:39.160
of silencing in a myth-making.

00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:43.270 position:56%
Liberal America's appetite for
dramatic African immigration stories

00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:49.150
of escape, heroic, self-redemption
and exile confers validity

00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:54.400
on immigrant narratives that
confirm these same stereotypes.

00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:59.430
These stories reaffirm America's
fate in the foundational reputation

00:51:59.430 --> 00:52:05.230
of their country as a land of
refuge and compassionate to rescue,

00:52:05.230 --> 00:52:09.340
and of Africa as a land
of poverty and misery.

00:52:09.340 --> 00:52:13.040
Other narratives of migration
and other migratory experiences

00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:16.440
and trajectories are marginalized
when stories of poverty

00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:19.960
and suffering-induced
migration are privileged.

00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:24.330
The refugee is also a trope of
the conservative American view

00:52:24.330 --> 00:52:26.760
of African migration to America.

00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:29.850
And migrant stories and realities
that depart from the figure

00:52:29.850 --> 00:52:35.320 position:56%
of the refugee are unintelligible to
American conservative sensibilities.

00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:38.350
Americans of the conservative
bend buy into the narrative

00:52:38.350 --> 00:52:43.660
of African economic dysfunction and
therefore imagine Africans largely

00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:47.460
as objects of American
humanitarian intervention.

00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:49.550
This means that they
cannot imagine Africans

00:52:49.550 --> 00:52:52.790
that are economically
successful in their homelands.

00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:57.840
This in turn makes it easy for them
to discount stories of successful,

00:52:57.840 --> 00:53:00.720
talented African migrants
to America.

00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:04.940
It also makes it easy for them to
believe that Africans are desperate

00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:08.550
to escape the horrors of their
homelands to come to America.

00:53:08.550 --> 00:53:12.050
Here too, the gaze is
self-assuring because it works

00:53:12.050 --> 00:53:15.700 position:56%
to reaffirm the belief that
America is a generous, compassionate

00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:17.300
and humanitarian country.

00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:21.010
One that is receptive
to African refugees.

00:53:21.010 --> 00:53:24.360
The template seems clear and
it's summed by its simplicity.

00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:30.580
Africa is a land that
perennially produces refugees

00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:33.470
and America is a country
that motivated

00:53:33.470 --> 00:53:36.880
by Christian compassion takes
them in and nurtures them back

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:39.280
to socioeconomic stability.

00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:41.940
The power of this idiom
of exile and escape has

00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:45.670
in turn shaped how African
immigrants themselves narrate their

00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:50.530
own experiences for the consumption
of American interlocutors.

00:53:50.530 --> 00:53:53.870
Examples of this genre
includes Ishmael Beah's--

00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:58.150
this book right here,
some of you know about it,

00:53:58.150 --> 00:54:03.630
Ishmael Beah's "A Long Way Gone"
and Chris Abani's autobiographical

00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:07.490
and semi-biographical works,
in which, you know, I kind of--

00:54:07.490 --> 00:54:11.100
it goes into all this lurid quite
frankly untenable, you know,

00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:15.210
quite frankly fantastical tales
about what he went through, what--

00:54:15.210 --> 00:54:17.370
how he escaped and
how he was detained.

00:54:17.370 --> 00:54:20.950
And we're talking about
penises being nailed to tables.

00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:22.490
These are stories that
just simply never happened,

00:54:22.490 --> 00:54:24.640
nobody can remember any
of these things happening,

00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:26.820
but there's an appetite
for these kinds of stories.

00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:29.010
These are the kinds of
stories that play well

00:54:29.010 --> 00:54:32.190
with this paradigm of
the refugee, right?

00:54:32.190 --> 00:54:35.500 position:56%
The more dramatic, the more dramatic
you are in telling the stories,

00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:37.170
the greater the market for it.

00:54:37.170 --> 00:54:40.400
So we have this genre,
this genre that is growing.

00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:45.610
So-- And we can talk
more about this later.

00:54:45.610 --> 00:54:51.760
This entails-- So you have
sometimes the narrative basically,

00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:54.610
the narrative pressures
placed on African immigrant,

00:54:54.610 --> 00:54:58.140
immigrant autobiographers
like Chris Abani.

00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:02.260
This is just a sampling of-- There
are so many works in this genre.

00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:05.320
These narratives ponder to
Western audiences' hunger

00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:08.520
for dramatic migrations
stories of African suffering

00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:11.590
and American humanitarian heroism.

00:55:11.590 --> 00:55:14.580
They cause these migrant
storytellers to make up events

00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:17.980
and scenarios to fit
certain prepackaged Western

00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:21.100
aesthetic expectations.

00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:24.810
This entails suppressing
stories of migration to America

00:55:24.810 --> 00:55:29.040
that lack this elements
of desperation and rescue.

00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:31.970
The resulting stories of
exile penned by Africans--

00:55:31.970 --> 00:55:36.070
African migrants in America
perpetuates the stereotypes

00:55:36.070 --> 00:55:40.730
of helpless, displaced migrants
seeking refuge in America

00:55:40.730 --> 00:55:44.560
and displaced alternative
stories of African migration

00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:49.860
where the motives are less
familiar and less sensational.

00:55:49.860 --> 00:55:55.290 position:56%
African immigrants themselves become
unwittingly active participants

00:55:55.290 --> 00:55:58.130
in a particular Western
trope of validating

00:55:58.130 --> 00:56:03.140
and rewarding personal narratives
of African migration that conforms

00:56:03.140 --> 00:56:04.790
to a certain valued template.

00:56:04.790 --> 00:56:08.630
And I'll close by just--
This is just a screen grab.

00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:11.290
If you go-- If you just-- and
just Google the name Chris Abani,

00:56:11.290 --> 00:56:13.460
this is one of the first
few pages you will see.

00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:15.510
And in this short piece-- I
don't know if you can read it--

00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:16.890
it tells about his suffering,

00:56:16.890 --> 00:56:18.220
how [inaudible] was
detained and tortured.

00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:22.820
And a lot of Nigerian sleuths have
done research, people who lived

00:56:22.820 --> 00:56:25.080
in those places, people who
lived through those times

00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:27.390
who were involved in the
pro-democracy struggle

00:56:27.390 --> 00:56:28.690
in the time that he claimed.

00:56:28.690 --> 00:56:29.990
Nobody remembered him.

00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:31.360
Nobody even remembered him on
the campus where he claimed

00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:33.730
to have been an activist, where
he claimed to have been arrested.

00:56:33.730 --> 00:56:35.580 position:56%
But this-- If you go to his website,

00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:37.290
to his personal website,
these stories persist.

00:56:37.290 --> 00:56:39.460
He has this website,
widely displayed.

00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:42.670
Wherever he's invited to talk
about his-- He's a great novelist,

00:56:42.670 --> 00:56:45.550
don't get me wrong, fantastic
novelist, fantastic writer.

00:56:45.550 --> 00:56:51.110
But, you know, he gets in the door
in most cases with these kinds

00:56:51.110 --> 00:56:53.830
of biographical narrative
of how he suffered

00:56:53.830 --> 00:56:56.270
and how ultimately he
escaped to America, right?

00:56:56.270 --> 00:56:57.590
So that becomes the catch.

00:56:57.590 --> 00:57:01.050
That becomes a way to get people
interested in his stories,

00:57:01.050 --> 00:57:03.930
even in his literature,
brilliant, he writes as is.

00:57:03.930 --> 00:57:07.000
You know, he cannot stand on
the merit of his literary works.

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:08.740
He has to kind of come
up with a story.

00:57:08.740 --> 00:57:10.410
Everywhere you go, when
it's been introduced,

00:57:10.410 --> 00:57:13.170
when his biographies are
being written, you know,

00:57:13.170 --> 00:57:15.670
they'd always talk about how he
was detained for so many days,

00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:17.840
how his penis was nailed to some--

00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:20.630
the floor, and how he was
hung up on a ceiling and left.

00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:22.360
You know, all kinds of
fantastical stories.

00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:26.540
So, that's what I'm trying to get
at, this appetite on this pressure

00:57:26.540 --> 00:57:30.600 position:56%
on the part of Africans to tell the
stories to validate the stereotypes.

00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:31.900
And I'll leave it at that.

00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:33.700
Thank you so much.

00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:37.970
[ Applause ]

00:57:37.970 --> 00:57:41.920
&gt;&gt; Toyin Falola: And let
me-- had to weigh in.

00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:48.400
For those folks who call
upon by immigration services,

00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:54.590
immigration attorneys, you find
many of these fantastic stories.

00:57:54.590 --> 00:57:58.670
And Western feminists have
also contributed to it.

00:57:58.670 --> 00:58:03.870
There was a [inaudible] for
instance, a [inaudible] of 10 years

00:58:03.870 --> 00:58:09.890
when you can see-- because they
want to avoid female circumcision,

00:58:09.890 --> 00:58:11.190
they should-- left [inaudible].

00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:15.310
Even in regions where those
practices have stopped

00:58:15.310 --> 00:58:17.800
since the 1940s.

00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:20.550
I come from a part of Nigeria

00:58:20.550 --> 00:58:24.910 position:56%
where the Christian community have
abolished female circumcision before

00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:27.680
I was born.

00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:30.570
Or stories of witchcrafts
which are made up.

00:58:30.570 --> 00:58:38.710
Look, I don't want to leave
Uganda because of witchcraft.

00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:40.400
Stories of senior wives.

00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:46.700
My father is married to four wives,
the first wife is about to kill me.

00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:54.510
So as Moses is saying, these
stories connect to some kind

00:58:54.510 --> 00:58:58.150
of ideological template
in this part of the world

00:58:58.150 --> 00:59:03.060
that validates some--
a number of issues.

00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:08.440
Then there are how
scholars also frame Africa,

00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:10.200
a project that I'm doing.

00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:14.630
And there is a way I'm
putting up this project,

00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:17.610
that we have a generation of
scholars who have been writing

00:59:17.610 --> 00:59:19.810 position:56%
about Africa when they're in Africa.

00:59:19.810 --> 00:59:24.610
And then, when they're
relocated here,

00:59:24.610 --> 00:59:26.730
they begin to write
Africa differently

00:59:26.730 --> 00:59:29.280
from how they are doing before.

00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:33.120 position:56%
In other words, the audience changes

00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:38.500
and the presentation
of Africa changes.

00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:42.770
I used to think that it's theories
that drew this because any time,

00:59:42.770 --> 00:59:49.690
you think out a theory, the
narrative automatically will shift.

00:59:49.690 --> 00:59:58.480
But locations also begin to shift
the conception of Africa depending

00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:02.390
on the signals they are given.

01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:07.080
And part of what we
want to do is also

01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:15.520
to see how migrations do
change the presentation,

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:20.790
not just by great scholars
like Chimamanda.

01:00:20.790 --> 01:00:26.630
The Nigerian Civil War is
50 years old next year.

01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:31.340
But to find a generation of
writers who are not even born,

01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:35.880
they are born after the war
but they talk about the war

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:39.160
as if they really,
really experienced it.

01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:42.860
And how many of the things
that Moses has said plug

01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:47.290
in to a bigger narrative
outside the frame of Africa.

01:00:47.290 --> 01:00:51.230
Let me now call on Nemata Blyden.

01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:56.060
And I want to use her
last name, Blyden.

01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:59.430
Any of you must have
heard about Wilmot Blyden.

01:00:59.430 --> 01:01:06.090 position:56%
She-- Wilmot was Africa's-- arguably
the most distinguished intellectual

01:01:06.090 --> 01:01:12.670
of the 19th century, who left the
West to go back to West Africa.

01:01:12.670 --> 01:01:17.220
And he began to frame a different
set of arguments around Islam,

01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:20.530
around the recovery of Africa.

01:01:20.530 --> 01:01:26.590
And she comes from the
lineage of the Blyden family,

01:01:26.590 --> 01:01:28.610
three greats or two greats?

01:01:28.610 --> 01:01:29.910
&gt;&gt; Nemata Blyden: Two.

01:01:29.910 --> 01:01:31.210
&gt;&gt; Toyin Falola: Two greats.

01:01:31.210 --> 01:01:32.510
&gt;&gt; Nemata Blyden: Actually one.

01:01:32.510 --> 01:01:33.810
&gt;&gt; Toyin Falola: One.

01:01:33.810 --> 01:01:36.230
And her dad was a professor
of political science at Nsukka

01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:39.620
in Nigeria and work
in very many places.

01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:44.100
We are grateful for this long
line of African intellectuals.

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:45.400
Thank you.

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:46.700
&gt;&gt; Nemata Blyden: Thank you.

01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:48.350
&gt;&gt; Toyin Falola: Yeah.

01:01:48.350 --> 01:01:50.690
[ Applause ]

01:01:50.690 --> 01:01:51.990
&gt;&gt; Nemata Blyden: Thank
you for that.

01:01:51.990 --> 01:01:53.830
He always embarrasses me like that.

01:01:53.830 --> 01:01:58.560
&gt;&gt; Toyin Falola: Sorry, excuse me.

01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:02.760
&gt;&gt; Nemata Blyden: And I'd like to
thank Dr. Falola for including me

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:06.360
in this event as well as
the Library of Congress.

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:13.900
I'm going to take license in
defining contemporary by going back

01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:18.040
to the 19th, late 19th
and early 20th century

01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:21.520
to take a historical approach
to the subject matter by looking

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:24.810
at a few individuals
that I characterize

01:02:24.810 --> 01:02:28.010
as immigrants from that period.

01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:30.530
And what I'm trying to do
with this in a larger study is

01:02:30.530 --> 01:02:34.720
to problematize how immigrants
and immigration are constructed

01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:39.920
in American history, typically
privileging European immigrants.

01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:43.470
So Africans are not black people
in general but for our purposes,

01:02:43.470 --> 01:02:46.730
Africans are not considered
immigrants in some ways

01:02:46.730 --> 01:02:49.380
in this country before the 1960s.

01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:54.210
And I'm going to try and play
with that a little bit in my talk.

01:02:54.210 --> 01:02:57.080
And I have these wonderful slides

01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:59.060
which I'm not going
to use all of them.

01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:03.940
And I forgot to include one of
them so I'm going to skip to--

01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:05.820
Let me skip to this
for now, I'll come back

01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:12.090
to the others if I have time.

01:03:12.090 --> 01:03:16.130
In a January 1915 letter
to the Washington Post,

01:03:16.130 --> 01:03:19.320
the African-American
Booker T. Washington,

01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:23.270
head of Tuskegee Institute made
an appeal to the American Congress

01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:27.010
and to the people of the United
States in favor of fair play

01:03:27.010 --> 01:03:30.990
and justice in connection with the
immigration bill now pending before

01:03:30.990 --> 01:03:35.060
the United States Senate, which
by amendment excludes from coming

01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:39.250
into this country any
person of African descent.

01:03:39.250 --> 01:03:43.340
He went on to empathically
state that the bill was "unjust,

01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:45.940
unreasonable and unnecessary."

01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:49.940
It is unnecessary, he proclaimed,
because only a few thousand people

01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:52.950
of African descent enter
this country annually.

01:03:52.950 --> 01:03:56.580 position:56%
Practically, all of these that do
come are mainly from the West Indies

01:03:56.580 --> 01:04:00.350
and almost none from
the continent of Africa.

01:04:00.350 --> 01:04:03.960
Washington went on to cite
the 1910 census pointing

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:09.370
out that only 40,319 blacks in the
United States were foreign born,

01:04:09.370 --> 01:04:13.280
and only 473 of those
were from Africa.

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:17.880 position:56%
He further noted that the
immigration bill puts an unnecessary

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:22.980
slight upon colored people by
classing them with alien criminals.

01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:26.810
Booker T. Washington argued that
the bill put unnecessary hardship

01:04:26.810 --> 01:04:31.780
on countries like Liberia, Cuba
and Haiti by restricting the entry

01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:34.000
of citizens from those countries.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.070
Blacks from the Caribbean
and Africa, he said,

01:04:36.070 --> 01:04:39.680
had proved as a whole
to be a law-abiding,

01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:43.140
intelligent, industrious class.

01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:45.950
Recent narratives exploring
the relationship between blacks

01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:49.900
from Africa and native-born black
Americans have constructed it

01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:55.570
as fraught with friction, tension,
rivalries and sometimes hostility.

01:04:55.570 --> 01:04:58.010
Characterized as a
recent phenomenon,

01:04:58.010 --> 01:05:01.440
this new African diaspora
has been highlighted

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:04.170
in sometimes sensational ways.

01:05:04.170 --> 01:05:07.350
"More Africans Enter US
Than in Days of Slavery",

01:05:07.350 --> 01:05:10.760
a 2005 New York Times'
headline read.

01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:13.620
While another article
from the same paper opined

01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:16.090
that the one million
Africans that had immigrated

01:05:16.090 --> 01:05:20.350
in the last 30 years
provided a "New Interpretation

01:05:20.350 --> 01:05:22.490
of African American History".

01:05:22.490 --> 01:05:24.990
Yet Africans had been
arriving as immigrants

01:05:24.990 --> 01:05:27.630
to the United States long
before Washington commented

01:05:27.630 --> 01:05:29.680
on their presence in 1950.

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:33.210
And though not in the drill
suggested by the times,

01:05:33.210 --> 01:05:36.170
they made a mark on
American society.

01:05:36.170 --> 01:05:39.220
Although the large African presence
in the United States resulted

01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:42.230
from the involuntary migration
of men and women and slave

01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:45.340
on the continent since
the 17th century,

01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:49.140
beginning in the 19th century,
Africans from the continent came

01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:51.200
to the United States
in small numbers.

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:54.450
And the most studied group
of African immigrants

01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:57.330
in that period are
probably the Cape Verdeans.

01:05:57.330 --> 01:05:59.840
Most people know about that group.

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:03.180
Throughout the late 19th
century, Africans trickled

01:06:03.180 --> 01:06:07.710
into the United States largely
interacting with African-Americans.

01:06:07.710 --> 01:06:09.780
In the late 19th and
early 20th century,

01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:12.320
many came as students
attending black institutions

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:16.700
of higher learning and frequently
interacted with black Americans,

01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:20.240
allowing for exchanges
on various levels.

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:23.170
Africans often came to study
in the United States with hopes

01:06:23.170 --> 01:06:26.550
of returning to their homeland
upon completion of their studies.

01:06:26.550 --> 01:06:32.100
At institutions like Fisk, Howard,
Lincoln and Livingston College,

01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:35.220
African students interacted with
their native-born American--

01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:37.330
black American counterparts.

01:06:37.330 --> 01:06:40.530
These interactions were often
guided by prevailing stereotypes

01:06:40.530 --> 01:06:44.440
of Africa held by Americans
in general.

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:47.440
The predominant view held by
most Americans was, of course,

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:50.000
of Africa as the Dark Continent.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.050
Largely negative portraying the
continent as savage, barbaric,

01:06:54.050 --> 01:06:57.790
needing uplift from
those more civilized.

01:06:57.790 --> 01:07:01.020
Because of the difficulties
adjusting to the African climate,

01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:03.570
like their white counterparts,
black churches

01:07:03.570 --> 01:07:07.480
and black missionaries start to
train Native Africans to serve

01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:09.170
as missionaries in
their own native land,

01:07:09.170 --> 01:07:12.300
so black missionaries
would encourage Africans

01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:16.030
to come to the United States.

01:07:16.030 --> 01:07:19.360
And these students came to the
United States a lot of times

01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:22.710
under the auspices of these
African-American missions.

01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:25.680
They offered African-Americans
the first opportunities to see

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:27.110
that the prevailing stereotypes

01:07:27.110 --> 01:07:29.750
about Africa and Africans
were wrong.

01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:31.910
Most Africans coming
to the United States

01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:35.040
in that era would have been
educated within colonial systems,

01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:38.800
missionary schools particularly
those who came and they mainly came

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:41.550
from the British colonies
in the earlier years.

01:07:41.550 --> 01:07:45.060
They were westernized, largely
Christian, with some knowledge

01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:46.570
of the society they were entering.

01:07:46.570 --> 01:07:51.660
In fact, in 1899, Bishop
Henry McNeal Turner

01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:55.140
of the African Methodist
Episcopal Zion Church noted,

01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:59.380
"Everybody appears to be amazed
at their learning refinement

01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:01.410
and general intelligence.

01:08:01.410 --> 01:08:02.710
So many of our people

01:08:02.710 --> 01:08:05.440
in this country believe all
Africans are mere heathens,

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:10.240
that they are paralyzed with
surprise to find such boys coming."

01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:13.780
And I'm sorry the slide I left
out is on the next section.

01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:17.210
James Aggrey was perhaps the
most famous African to arrive

01:08:17.210 --> 01:08:21.210
in the United States in that
era, and might well be deemed one

01:08:21.210 --> 01:08:24.270
of the first African
immigrants in the United States,

01:08:24.270 --> 01:08:26.310
although he isn't often
thought of as such.

01:08:26.310 --> 01:08:28.010
Now, I grew up listening to stories

01:08:28.010 --> 01:08:30.260
about James Aggrey
at the dinner table.

01:08:30.260 --> 01:08:32.800
My father hero worships
James Aggrey.

01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:36.050
But in anything that he said
or in anything that I ever read

01:08:36.050 --> 01:08:40.200
about James Aggrey, he's never
mentioned as an African immigrant

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:44.480
in the United States and
I construct him as such.

01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:48.070
Born in the Gold Coast, later
Ghana, Aggrey attended mission

01:08:48.070 --> 01:08:51.890
and colonial schools in the British
colony excelling in his studies.

01:08:51.890 --> 01:08:55.960 position:56%
He soon came to the notice of
missionaries and colonial officials.

01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:57.920
And in 1898, he was sponsored

01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:01.340
by Bishop Bryan Small
of the AME Zion Church.

01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:05.530
And he came to-- was brought by
Bishop Small to the United States

01:09:05.530 --> 01:09:10.700
in 1898 to study at Livingston
College in North Carolina.

01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:13.890
Aggrey completed his studies at
Livingston, later becoming a member

01:09:13.890 --> 01:09:16.790
of faculty and an administrator.

01:09:16.790 --> 01:09:19.100
He remained in the United
States until his death

01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:24.400 position:56%
in 1927 marrying Rose Douglas, an
African-American woman from Virginia

01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:28.140
and raising his family
in North Carolina.

01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:31.900
Although he continued to highlight
his African heritage expressing his

01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:35.210
love and devotion to his
homeland, he dedicated himself

01:09:35.210 --> 01:09:38.230
to the improvement and
uplift of African-Americans.

01:09:38.230 --> 01:09:41.350
He was popular with students
and had a great reputation,

01:09:41.350 --> 01:09:45.130
a classmate of his noted.

01:09:45.130 --> 01:09:50.010 position:56%
WJ Trent, this classmate also
observed that Aggrey's influence was

01:09:50.010 --> 01:09:53.060
"very precious and had a great
deal to do with the improvement

01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:55.510
of the moral and spiritual
conditions

01:09:55.510 --> 01:09:57.830
of the whole college life."

01:09:57.830 --> 01:10:01.080
Having been ordained in the AME
Zion Church, Aggrey preached

01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:03.600
in black churches all
over North Carolina.

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:05.720
He pastored two African
American churches

01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:09.210
in rural communities
in that state as well.

01:10:09.210 --> 01:10:12.660
His parishioners were mostly
poor, illiterate, rural people,

01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:14.860
mainly farmers and laborers.

01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:18.180
Working with these communities was
one of the most fulfilling aspects

01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:20.740
of Aggrey's work in
the United States.

01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:25.180
His biographer tells us, "it took
him out of an academic atmosphere

01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:27.210
and introduced him
to the actualities

01:10:27.210 --> 01:10:30.140
of life led by the American Negro."

01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:33.800
Clearly, his relationship with
African-Americans was characterized

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:37.590
by mutual respect as is evident
from the many outpourings of grief

01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:40.240
from African-Americans
after his death.

01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:43.980
The bibliophile Arthur
Schomburg, in remembering Aggrey,

01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:47.390
pointed out his influence and
legacy in the United States,

01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:51.140
describing his contributions
to black Americans.

01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:54.600
"At a Native American
school, Livingston College,

01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:57.980
set in the panoramic mountains
of Salisbury, North Carolina,"

01:10:57.980 --> 01:11:00.950
Schomburg said, "he
received the milk of kindness

01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:03.240
and remained with his own people.

01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:06.540
Later his loved joined
that of an American Rose

01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:09.990
and made his stay permanent
among us."

01:11:09.990 --> 01:11:12.570 position:56%
Yet Aggrey also felt his difference.

01:11:12.570 --> 01:11:14.920
And there are signs that
he was not fully accepted

01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:17.280
as an American despite
his citizenship

01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:19.940 position:56%
and Aggrey actually was naturalized.

01:11:19.940 --> 01:11:23.290 position:56%
He felt the strain of being excluded
from the larger white society,

01:11:23.290 --> 01:11:27.070
but he also felt slighted
by African-Americans.

01:11:27.070 --> 01:11:31.040
His biographer writes that Aggrey
was accepted by whites more easily

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:34.550
than native-born blacks, making
it harder for him to get along

01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:36.940
with some African-Americans.

01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:40.580
He gained the respect and ardent
affection of a number of these

01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:44.780
but in the minds of not a few,
the old prejudice persisted.

01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:47.640
In 1917, Aggrey was
up for the position

01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:50.190
of president of Livingston College.

01:11:50.190 --> 01:11:52.860
He was not offered the
position and believed it was

01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:56.820
because he was not a
native-born black American.

01:11:56.820 --> 01:11:59.080
Though he later was
offered the position,

01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:01.410
he declined it at that time.

01:12:01.410 --> 01:12:03.660
He appears to have been
passed up for other positions

01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:07.790
which he attributed to his foreign
status rather than his race.

01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:11.270
In a letter to his wife
he wrote, "I am convinced

01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:14.300
that being a foreigner," and
he puts foreigner in quotes,

01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:18.350
"I could never command in any sort
of place the decent kind of a job

01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:21.460
in this country that would
keep me to take care of you

01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:24.710
and give the children the
education they deserve.

01:12:24.710 --> 01:12:26.210
That is the way I see it.

01:12:26.210 --> 01:12:27.790
You may not see it that way.

01:12:27.790 --> 01:12:30.310
I am resigned to my fate."

01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:33.560
He went on to tell Rose of
another African, one Norman Wilson

01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:37.520
from Sierra Leone, living in
New York who faced the same sort

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:41.180
of discrimination, "Thwarted
at every turn in his desire

01:12:41.180 --> 01:12:43.290
for advancement," Aggrey noted,

01:12:43.290 --> 01:12:46.040
"that Wilson was considering
a return to Africa

01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:50.160
because he tells me his brother
priest have been fighting him

01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:52.000
because he's a foreigner.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.930
He has had to go to the bishop.

01:12:53.930 --> 01:12:56.150
He says he's getting tired of it.

01:12:56.150 --> 01:12:59.230
They acknowledged his work and
his influence but they fight him

01:12:59.230 --> 01:13:02.180
in an underhand way
because he is a foreigner.

01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:05.030
Too bad for our race, too bad.

01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:07.420
He has finished his
work for his BA degree.

01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:11.030
He tells me he hopes this will
be his last year at this working

01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:15.770
under such stress, the
everlasting foreigner nag."

01:13:15.770 --> 01:13:18.800
No doubt their foreign
status was significant.

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:22.870
But in the 1920s when Aggrey
wrote their race was surely just

01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:26.490
as important to their
inability to advance.

01:13:26.490 --> 01:13:28.200
Like Aggrey-- And I
do have the slide

01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:36.390
for this, if I can get back to it.

01:13:36.390 --> 01:13:40.810 position:56%
Like Aggrey, Orishatukeh Faduma came
to the United States as a student

01:13:40.810 --> 01:13:44.190
and stayed becoming an immigrant.

01:13:44.190 --> 01:13:48.240
Born William Davis in Sierra Leone,
Faduma came to the United States

01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:54.880
in 1890-- sorry, a slide one back.

01:13:57.030 --> 01:13:59.470
Here we go, sorry.

01:13:59.470 --> 01:14:02.970
OK, I should stop touching it.

01:14:02.970 --> 01:14:09.330
Faduma came to the United States
in 1890 to study at Yale--

01:14:09.330 --> 01:14:11.420
It's doing it on its own.

01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:13.410
Am I pressing it too hard?

01:14:13.410 --> 01:14:16.510
It's not that important.

01:14:16.510 --> 01:14:17.810
OK.

01:14:17.810 --> 01:14:19.320
&gt;&gt; Toyin Falola: Very sensitive.

01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:20.720
&gt;&gt; Nemata Blyden: Is it looping?

01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:23.100
He came to study at the
Yale Divinity School

01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:24.400
in New Haven, Connecticut.

01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:27.910 position:56%
After completing his degree in 1894,

01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:30.140
he took a position in
the American South.

01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:33.630
Like Aggrey, he married an
African-American woman Henrietta

01:14:33.630 --> 01:14:37.190
Adams from Georgia, and
taught at the Peabody Academy,

01:14:37.190 --> 01:14:41.630
a black institution in Troy,
North Carolina for 17 years.

01:14:41.630 --> 01:14:44.300
Served as a missionary and
educator to African-Americans

01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:49.190
in North Carolina for 50
years until he died in 1946.

01:14:49.190 --> 01:14:51.800
In 1913, Faduma worked closely

01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:54.410
with the African-American
Chief Alfred Sam and his Back

01:14:54.410 --> 01:14:58.940 position:56%
to Africa movement, encouraging
black Americans to return to Africa.

01:14:58.940 --> 01:15:03.780
Though he himself never returned
becoming naturalized in 1902,

01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:05.330
he spent the rest of his life

01:15:05.330 --> 01:15:09.210
in the United States living
among African-Americans.

01:15:09.210 --> 01:15:12.560
Both Faduma and Aggrey, like
many Africans in that era,

01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:16.510
lived in a segregated south and
operated within a world in which

01:15:16.510 --> 01:15:18.620
by virtue of the color
of their skin,

01:15:18.620 --> 01:15:20.860
they were thought to be inferior.

01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:23.240
Both men adapted to
their lives as black men

01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:26.980
in a racially segregated nation,
at a time when discrimination

01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:31.200
and racism were leveled at men
and women of African descent.

01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:34.760
Both lived and worked among the
less privileged African-Americans

01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:38.530
and saw it as their responsibility
and duty to enhance their lives

01:15:38.530 --> 01:15:43.170
and improve their condition, which
was kind of a reverse, right,

01:15:43.170 --> 01:15:44.470
with Faduma referring

01:15:44.470 --> 01:15:47.700
to African-Americans
as his kith and kin.

01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:51.820
His contributions were
recognized in the 1904 publication.

01:15:51.820 --> 01:15:55.690
In an article profiling him, he
was lauded for his contributions

01:15:55.690 --> 01:15:59.580
to African-Americans and for
his missionary work among them.

01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:01.980
The article noted, "We question

01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:05.280
if this Native African could
have made a better investment

01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:08.940
of his powers had he
remained in Africa.

01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:10.990
Africa is here."

01:16:10.990 --> 01:16:14.710
Although Aggrey and Faduma settled
in the south, a few Africans lived

01:16:14.710 --> 01:16:16.980
in northern cities like New York.

01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:20.350
And over the years, blacks from
Africa continued to migrate

01:16:20.350 --> 01:16:23.100
to the United States
for various reasons.

01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:24.400
While relations

01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:26.350
with African-Americans
were not always positive,

01:16:26.350 --> 01:16:30.260 position:56%
Africans found more
commonalities with African-Americans

01:16:30.260 --> 01:16:32.410
than with the larger white society.

01:16:32.410 --> 01:16:34.160
For the most part in
these early years,

01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:37.440
Africans faced the same
discrimination from white Americans

01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:39.740
as their native-born counterparts.

01:16:39.740 --> 01:16:42.560
Although some highlighted their
difference and distinctiveness

01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:46.260
from black Americans, what white
Americans often saw was their

01:16:46.260 --> 01:16:47.630
black skin.

01:16:47.630 --> 01:16:52.180 position:56%
On the other hand, African-Americans
frequently welcome them as brethren.

01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:57.280
In a 1971 interview, Bishop William
Jacob Walls, an African alumnus

01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:01.050
of Livingston College where
Aggrey had attended remembered

01:17:01.050 --> 01:17:05.900
that Africans were not looked down
upon us inferior by this campus.

01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:11.000 position:56%
For many Africans, the issues facing
African-Americans came to be theirs.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.280
In the period before the 1960s,

01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:15.950
perhaps because their
numbers were small and because

01:17:15.950 --> 01:17:18.810
of the hostile environment in
which they often found themselves,

01:17:18.810 --> 01:17:22.400
Africans living in the
United States lived alongside

01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:24.500
and among black Americans.

01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:26.980
Although they may have held
particular views and stereotypes

01:17:26.980 --> 01:17:30.930
of African-Americans-- of Africans
before arriving as they lived

01:17:30.930 --> 01:17:33.400
in the United States
for extended periods,

01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:37.050
they relied on African-Americans
for an understanding of the society

01:17:37.050 --> 01:17:38.980
into which they had come.

01:17:38.980 --> 01:17:43.430
The 1965 Hart-Celler Immigration
Bill would change the size,

01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:45.830
composition and demographic profile

01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:48.800
of the African population
in the United States.

01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:52.240
This act, liberalizing
American immigration laws,

01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:55.640
would change to some extent too
the nature of the relationship

01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:58.230
between African-Americans
and Africans.

01:17:58.230 --> 01:18:01.630
Coming at the height of the Civil
Rights Movement, Africans studying

01:18:01.630 --> 01:18:04.220
in American colleges often
found themselves in the midst

01:18:04.220 --> 01:18:07.930
of agitation, civil rights
protests and marches, sit-ins

01:18:07.930 --> 01:18:10.370
and other attempts
by African-Americans

01:18:10.370 --> 01:18:13.530
to desegregate public
spaces and institutions.

01:18:13.530 --> 01:18:16.460
Africans sometimes were
mistaken for black Americans

01:18:16.460 --> 01:18:18.750
and face the same racial profiling.

01:18:18.750 --> 01:18:23.230
As the United States increasingly
became a desegregated society

01:18:23.230 --> 01:18:26.970
and one that was more open to
foreigners, Africans continue

01:18:26.970 --> 01:18:31.130
to arrive on its shores in larger
numbers now finding themselves

01:18:31.130 --> 01:18:34.400 position:56%
with more options and opportunities.

01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:38.190
Coming from newly African-- newly
independent African nations,

01:18:38.190 --> 01:18:42.000
many saw a little need to
settle among black Americans.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:45.030
As the number and composition
of African immigrants has grown,

01:18:45.030 --> 01:18:48.150
so have the perceptions that
they, like other immigrants,

01:18:48.150 --> 01:18:50.720
are different from
African-Americans.

01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:54.260 position:56%
While during the era of segregation,
black immigrants were often forced

01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:57.250
to live alongside black
Americans, the new liberal

01:18:57.250 --> 01:19:01.300 position:56%
and relatively tolerable post-civil
rights America has given more recent

01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:05.330
immigrants the opportunity to live
apart from and distance themselves

01:19:05.330 --> 01:19:07.630
from African-American populations.

01:19:07.630 --> 01:19:10.000
These black immigrants
are no longer settling

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.410
in traditional gateway cities
like New York or Miami but more

01:19:13.410 --> 01:19:16.680
and more attracted to suburban
areas or as in the case

01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:19.920
of Somalis in Maine to rural areas.

01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:22.120
Despite the racial stereotypes,

01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:24.590
some black immigrants
prefer settling among mixed

01:19:24.590 --> 01:19:27.920
or largely white populations
believing that assimilating

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:32.680
with African-Americans would hinder
their socioeconomic advancement.

01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:36.350
African immigrants also fear
the loss of ethnic identity

01:19:36.350 --> 01:19:38.860
and they highlight their
distinctive heritage.

01:19:38.860 --> 01:19:41.770
As immigrants, they have sometimes
lacked an understanding of

01:19:41.770 --> 01:19:43.600
and do not identify

01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:47.850
with post-slavery issues affecting
native-born American blacks.

01:19:47.850 --> 01:19:50.840
As one young African
immigrant interviewed

01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:53.340
for an Arizona news article stated,

01:19:53.340 --> 01:19:56.260
"I don't associate
myself with slavery."

01:19:56.260 --> 01:20:00.080
The article notes that these
new African-Americans lack ties

01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:04.230
to American slavery and the inner
city culture frequently associated

01:20:04.230 --> 01:20:05.810
with black America.

01:20:05.810 --> 01:20:09.650
Many grew up in middle-class,
two-parent families and have access

01:20:09.650 --> 01:20:13.100
to social networks that include
doctors, nurses, engineers,

01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:15.970
professors and business executive.

01:20:15.970 --> 01:20:19.300
Nonetheless, urban areas
remain important destinations

01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:22.350
for some African immigrants
who choose or are forced

01:20:22.350 --> 01:20:25.610
by economic circumstances
to settle in areas

01:20:25.610 --> 01:20:28.580
with significant black
American populations.

01:20:28.580 --> 01:20:31.800
These immigrants recognize
their status as a minority

01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:34.060
and understand the
consequences of ethnicity

01:20:34.060 --> 01:20:36.260
and race in the United States.

01:20:36.260 --> 01:20:39.330
African immigrants increasingly
recognize the struggles

01:20:39.330 --> 01:20:43.180
of African-Americans in providing
the world into which they came.

01:20:43.180 --> 01:20:46.920
One immigrant remarked, "We feel
that those African-Americans

01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:49.400
who were here before
were the pioneers.

01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:53.170
If it wasn't for Martin Luther King
Jr. and the Civil Rights Movement,

01:20:53.170 --> 01:20:55.640
we wouldn't be here
in the first place."

01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:58.470
And as one scholar has
noted, black migrants,

01:20:58.470 --> 01:21:02.380
unlike light-skinned migrants,
also face an entirely different set

01:21:02.380 --> 01:21:06.850
of issues directly related to
fitting in with American society.

01:21:06.850 --> 01:21:10.290
They must reconstruct and
redefine their identity in terms

01:21:10.290 --> 01:21:15.240
of the American society's system
of race relations and hierarchy.

01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:18.180
This, they sometimes
find difficult to do.

01:21:18.180 --> 01:21:22.130 position:56%
As one immigrant noted, African
immigrants sometimes struggle to fit

01:21:22.130 --> 01:21:24.710
into black American
culture that has been shaped

01:21:24.710 --> 01:21:27.470
by civil disobedience
and peaceful protest.

01:21:27.470 --> 01:21:32.000 position:56%
Many hesitate to speak out on race
issues because they fear deportation

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.960
or showing disrespect to
their adopted homeland.

01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:36.950
They have, largely, not
integrated themselves

01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:38.650
into African-American institutions

01:21:38.650 --> 01:21:41.750
and organizations often
creating separate ethnic,

01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:44.970
hometown or country associations.

01:21:44.970 --> 01:21:46.930
This reluctance to identify fully

01:21:46.930 --> 01:21:49.240
with the African-Americans
has sometimes led

01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:51.650
to tensions between the two groups.

01:21:51.650 --> 01:21:53.820
For example, at the turn
of the 21st century,

01:21:53.820 --> 01:21:57.800
several incidents highlighted the
differences between the two groups.

01:21:57.800 --> 01:22:02.870
In 2005, an Ivorian street vendor
in Harlem frequently harassed

01:22:02.870 --> 01:22:08.280 position:56%
by black Americans lashed out in
return, resulting in a street brawl.

01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:11.830
While these incidents are
infrequent, they nevertheless point

01:22:11.830 --> 01:22:13.540
at continued misunderstandings

01:22:13.540 --> 01:22:16.540
between African-Americans
and black immigrants.

01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:19.660
Stereotypical views and
representations of Africa continue

01:22:19.660 --> 01:22:21.340
to be shown in mainstream media.

01:22:21.340 --> 01:22:23.410
Negative images and ideas

01:22:23.410 --> 01:22:26.880
about Africa still persist
among African-Americans,

01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:29.900
largely because African Americans
students still are not taught much

01:22:29.900 --> 01:22:33.090
about Africa, and when
exposed to Africans fall back

01:22:33.090 --> 01:22:36.720
on old stereotypes of Africa
as the "Dark Continent".

01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:39.010
Also at the heart of
African-American suspicion

01:22:39.010 --> 01:22:42.330
of black immigrants is the belief
that they are competing for jobs

01:22:42.330 --> 01:22:45.240
and other opportunities
and resources with them.

01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:49.120
As the scholar John Bracey
observed of the Harlem incident,

01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:52.390
Africans are seen as
another immigrant group

01:22:52.390 --> 01:22:55.340
that is pushing past
African-Americans.

01:22:55.340 --> 01:22:57.470
This is particular issue
of black immigrants

01:22:57.470 --> 01:23:01.200
who some African Americans believe
are given preference for employment

01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:03.970
by white employees-- employers.

01:23:03.970 --> 01:23:08.620
Louis Chude-Sokei points out that
"whites have historically tended

01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:11.530
to regard black immigrants
as a model minority

01:23:11.530 --> 01:23:14.970
within a troublesome
native-born black population.

01:23:14.970 --> 01:23:17.660
A good proportion of immigrants,
tend to be better educated

01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:21.390
than African-Americans, don't
have the chip or racial resentment

01:23:21.390 --> 01:23:24.930
on their shoulder and exhibit
the classic immigrant optimism

01:23:24.930 --> 01:23:28.940
about assimilation into the
mainstream culture," he argues.

01:23:28.940 --> 01:23:30.560
On the other hand, misconceptions

01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:34.040
about African-Americans
persist among Africans as well.

01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:37.590
The belief perpetuated by
the media and other sources

01:23:37.590 --> 01:23:40.920
that African-Americans are not hard
working and frequently fall back

01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:42.520
on the history of racism

01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:46.560
to make excuses still
persists among some Africans.

01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:50.490
As Bill Fletcher, president of
TransAfrica Forum commented,

01:23:50.490 --> 01:23:52.580
"Many African-Americans
are embarrassed

01:23:52.580 --> 01:23:53.960
or ambivalent about Africa.

01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:56.620
And many Africans have
misconceptions

01:23:56.620 --> 01:24:00.040
about the opportunities
available to African-Americans.

01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:03.100
They often fail to appreciate
what the African-Americans have

01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:04.970
gone through."

01:24:04.970 --> 01:24:08.520
African immigrant attempts to
maintain a distinct identity

01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:11.100
from African-Americans,
allows them the hope

01:24:11.100 --> 01:24:16.180
of protecting their children from
racialization in American society.

01:24:16.180 --> 01:24:19.420
Nonetheless, while African
immigrants in their attempt to cope

01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:20.720
with the racial hierarchy

01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:24.100 position:56%
in the United States have
frequently claimed a foreign status,

01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:27.920
they find it hard to insulate
themselves from white--

01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:30.650
racial stereotypes
and discrimination.

01:24:30.650 --> 01:24:33.580
Africans settling in urban
areas are more likely to closer

01:24:33.580 --> 01:24:36.620
to the African-Americans
resulting in some tensions

01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:39.200
but also providing the
opportunity for the group to learn

01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:42.720
about each other and in some
instances to work together

01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:47.060
in both social and political
causes and on an individual level.

01:24:47.060 --> 01:24:51.230
Though misunderstanding persists,
in recent years, as in past years,

01:24:51.230 --> 01:24:53.720
these groups have cooperated
with each other rather

01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:56.350 position:56%
than highlighting their differences.

01:24:56.350 --> 01:25:00.800
And in most major metropolitan
areas and even in smaller suburbs,

01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:04.320
African businesses and
organizations can now be found

01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:06.530
as established institutions.

01:25:06.530 --> 01:25:10.150 position:56%
Whether they're hair braiding salons
or Senegalese restaurants in Harlem,

01:25:10.150 --> 01:25:14.220
or the many African grocery
stores in Woodbridge, Virginia,

01:25:14.220 --> 01:25:17.740
these businesses have become a
familiar part of the landscape.

01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:20.270
They are patronized not
only by other Africans

01:25:20.270 --> 01:25:22.630
but also African-Americans.

01:25:22.630 --> 01:25:25.540
Likewise, the many African
churches springing up in cities

01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:28.370
and suburbs all over the
country are drawing African

01:25:28.370 --> 01:25:29.950
American congregants.

01:25:29.950 --> 01:25:32.970
In other words, the relationship
between black immigrants

01:25:32.970 --> 01:25:37.290
and American-born blacks is not
always characterized by tension.

01:25:37.290 --> 01:25:41.070
Like Aggrey and Faduma, black
immigrants are also intermarrying

01:25:41.070 --> 01:25:43.500
in greater numbers with
the African-Americans.

01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:45.890
The children of these
unions frequently identify

01:25:45.890 --> 01:25:47.970
with both parts of their heritage.

01:25:47.970 --> 01:25:51.120 position:56%
Furthermore, children of black
immigrants born in the United States

01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:54.490
or brought here as young
children, more often than not,

01:25:54.490 --> 01:25:55.790
think of themselves

01:25:55.790 --> 01:25:58.180
as African-Americans
in different context.

01:25:58.180 --> 01:26:01.920
Identifying with that-- Sometimes
identifying with that culture often

01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:04.460
with some resistance
from their parents.

01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:06.110
However, the American-born children

01:26:06.110 --> 01:26:08.610
of African immigrants have
often been most successful

01:26:08.610 --> 01:26:12.570
at understanding American society
than their parents have as evident

01:26:12.570 --> 01:26:16.540
in their increased participation
in civic and political issues.

01:26:16.540 --> 01:26:20.750
Recent events have highlighted
these commonalities and of course,

01:26:20.750 --> 01:26:24.430
the most high profile
one was the 1999 shooting

01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:28.710
of the Guinean immigrant Amadou
Diallo where African-Americans--

01:26:28.710 --> 01:26:32.560
activists rallied around
African immigrants.

01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:35.310
And more recently, many
African immigrants,

01:26:35.310 --> 01:26:37.950
particularly of the younger
generation have been involved

01:26:37.950 --> 01:26:39.890
in the Black Lives Matter movement.

01:26:39.890 --> 01:26:43.140
More formal ties and
connections are also being created

01:26:43.140 --> 01:26:45.840
between African-Americans
and black immigrants.

01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:47.710
Just as Booker T. Washington spoke

01:26:47.710 --> 01:26:52.230
out against the 1915
immigration bill, in 2006,

01:26:52.230 --> 01:26:55.720
a group of black American and black
African immigrants came together

01:26:55.720 --> 01:27:00.450
in Oakland, California to form the
Black Alliance for Just Immigration

01:27:00.450 --> 01:27:04.110
to "support the demands of
the immigrant rights movement

01:27:04.110 --> 01:27:08.900 position:56%
and to engage African-Americans in
a dialog about the underlying issues

01:27:08.900 --> 01:27:14.140
of race and economic status that
frame US immigration policy."

01:27:14.140 --> 01:27:16.100
The relationship between
blacks and--

01:27:16.100 --> 01:27:20.580
from Africa and African-Americans
has been long and continuous.

01:27:20.580 --> 01:27:23.380
Since the late 19th
and early 20th century,

01:27:23.380 --> 01:27:26.500
black immigrants have been
arriving in the United States.

01:27:26.500 --> 01:27:30.360 position:56%
Although at times they may have seem
invisible to the largest society,

01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:32.280
black immigrants were
never invisible

01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:36.410
to African-Americans among whom
they settled, worked, married,

01:27:36.410 --> 01:27:39.970
and who were often their
entry point into the society.

01:27:39.970 --> 01:27:43.050
Although in adjusting to American
society they have experienced

01:27:43.050 --> 01:27:44.930
difficulty in assimilating,

01:27:44.930 --> 01:27:48.420
the presence of an established
native-born black population has

01:27:48.420 --> 01:27:50.870 position:56%
been beneficial to black immigrants.

01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:54.790
As more black immigrants arrive in
the United States, the definition

01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:58.220
of African American will
expand as black immigrants

01:27:58.220 --> 01:28:01.020
and native-born blacks
find common cause.

01:28:01.020 --> 01:28:02.820
Thank you.

01:28:02.820 --> 01:28:05.390
[ Applause ]

01:28:05.390 --> 01:28:07.070
Did I run overtime?

01:28:07.070 --> 01:28:09.940
Oh no, I have 11 seconds left.

01:28:13.090 --> 01:28:19.930
&gt;&gt; Toyin Falola: Thank you very
much for locating this subject,

01:28:19.930 --> 01:28:30.320
in terms of historical evolution
and contemporary tension.

01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:34.630
For those of you who
follow the recent politics,

01:28:34.630 --> 01:28:38.220
the recent election, and even
through Africa [inaudible],

01:28:38.220 --> 01:28:41.790
many of you will be
shocked there is a lot

01:28:41.790 --> 01:28:44.250
of support for Trump in Africa.

01:28:44.250 --> 01:28:48.580
I would try to Moses,
for instance, was--

01:28:48.580 --> 01:28:55.720
wrote a piece on why
that massive support.

01:28:55.720 --> 01:29:04.420
And issues that you-- for those
of you who has come in to America,

01:29:04.420 --> 01:29:08.220
a theme that was done
over 20 years ago,

01:29:08.220 --> 01:29:14.730
some of what Nemata is
saying is captured in that.

01:29:14.730 --> 01:29:21.180
But there are issues
that we have to--

01:29:21.180 --> 01:29:24.230
First of all, we need a
long book on this subject

01:29:24.230 --> 01:29:26.830
because it's used to
be from last kinship.

01:29:26.830 --> 01:29:32.130
And then they're reframing.

01:29:32.130 --> 01:29:38.480
And if you look at how we define
Africa today, how we teach Africa,

01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:42.730
the person we hold the most is
Du Bois because he's the one

01:29:42.730 --> 01:29:48.420
who actually framed it in
a way that we now accept.

01:29:48.420 --> 01:29:52.320
If you look at the-- We've
rejected the Arab framing of it

01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:55.170
as the land of the black.

01:29:55.170 --> 01:30:00.560
We rejected the European
framing of it.

01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:04.360
And Washington, DC takes
the earlier European framing

01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:09.130
in which they lumped part of
North Africa with the Middle East

01:30:09.130 --> 01:30:14.270
and it is Du Bois in that
generation who said, "No,

01:30:14.270 --> 01:30:19.110
we are going to frame-- We are
now going to disconnect Africa

01:30:19.110 --> 01:30:21.770
from Egypt from North Africa."

01:30:21.770 --> 01:30:24.460
And that is what that
state in Africa itself

01:30:24.460 --> 01:30:30.610
and the way in which we teach.

01:30:30.610 --> 01:30:37.040
And you'll find when we go into the
academic understanding of Africa--

01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:38.340
&gt;&gt; The restroom is this way, yes.

01:30:38.340 --> 01:30:41.490
&gt;&gt; Toyin Falola: -- part of
what you'd find in literature is

01:30:41.490 --> 01:30:45.080
that it was created
in London in the '40s,

01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:48.560
whereas African-Americans
have actually created many

01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:54.500
of this discipline long,
long time before this.

01:30:54.500 --> 01:30:58.620
It is true that contemporary
immigrants are not connected

01:30:58.620 --> 01:31:01.160
with the civil rights movement.

01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:04.940
Many of them are beneficiaries
of the struggles

01:31:04.940 --> 01:31:11.160
but they did not contribute to
the struggle and it shapes some

01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:14.070
of what they see and
some of what they do.

01:31:14.070 --> 01:31:21.270
But fundamentally, since the fall
of apartheid, we've been struggling

01:31:21.270 --> 01:31:25.350
to create one common-- one
reason, one common cause

01:31:25.350 --> 01:31:30.900
that will unite blacks on
both sides of the Atlantic.

01:31:30.900 --> 01:31:36.630
So, anti-colonial struggles,
domestic US politics

01:31:36.630 --> 01:31:38.750
and civil rights united them,

01:31:38.750 --> 01:31:41.790
anti-apartheid struggles
united them.

01:31:41.790 --> 01:31:46.770
But today, there has been
not a single one cause.

01:31:46.770 --> 01:31:54.780
And until we get that one cause,
it's a little bit of challenge

01:31:54.780 --> 01:31:56.180
to bring people together.

01:31:56.180 --> 01:31:59.250
And we're searching for
that one common cause.

01:31:59.250 --> 01:32:04.010
Maybe struggles against
poverty may be adapted.

01:32:04.010 --> 01:32:12.100
But what the African Union has done
is to join Africa into six regions.

01:32:12.100 --> 01:32:16.030
The older definition, it's
a continent of five regions.

01:32:16.030 --> 01:32:19.330
But now, officially,
Africa has six regions

01:32:19.330 --> 01:32:24.070
in which they now include
the African diaspora

01:32:24.070 --> 01:32:26.660
as an official sixth region.

01:32:26.660 --> 01:32:34.090
And how this will be connected to
textbook writings, on politics,

01:32:34.090 --> 01:32:38.820
on policies are things we
have to pay attention to.

01:32:38.820 --> 01:32:41.710
Let me now call on Ken,
right, you're next.

01:32:41.710 --> 01:32:43.150
Is it Ken?

01:32:43.150 --> 01:32:44.840
Where is Abdul?

01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:47.520
OK. But Ken is next, right?

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:48.820
Yeah.

01:32:48.820 --> 01:32:50.380
&gt;&gt; Kenneth Harrow: Yeah.

01:32:50.380 --> 01:32:52.630
[ Applause ]

01:32:52.630 --> 01:32:57.800
OK. I'd like to start
my presentation again

01:32:57.800 --> 01:32:59.820
by thanking-- Yeah.

01:32:59.820 --> 01:33:02.750
[Inaudible] so wait another minute?

01:33:02.750 --> 01:33:07.890
OK. Thanking Professor
Falola for the invitation

01:33:07.890 --> 01:33:12.770
and thanking Edward Widmer, the
director of the Kluge Center

01:33:12.770 --> 01:33:14.450
and for bringing me
to this gorgeous,

01:33:14.450 --> 01:33:18.580
gorgeous building in
this cold, cold day.

01:33:18.580 --> 01:33:23.220
So, hello everyone.

01:33:23.220 --> 01:33:26.460
I gave my presentation-- I
had lost, is this thing here.

01:33:26.460 --> 01:33:30.790 position:56%
Here we go, with the title "What is
African Literature or Cinema Today?"

01:33:30.790 --> 01:33:34.130
Where do we look for
African literature?

01:33:34.130 --> 01:33:39.810
Is there a-- Does that
look funny on the screen?

01:33:39.810 --> 01:33:45.550
No? OK. I made Ama Ata Aidoo
with brown a couple of years ago.

01:33:45.550 --> 01:33:46.850
It is quite emotional.

01:33:46.850 --> 01:33:50.820
She was warm and greeting me and
I expatiated on how much I love

01:33:50.820 --> 01:33:53.580
to work and had written about it.

01:33:53.580 --> 01:33:56.850
When I told her I was interested
in the question of the production

01:33:56.850 --> 01:34:00.930
of African culture by Africans
living outside the continent,

01:34:00.930 --> 01:34:03.580
she got so upset, she
got up to leave.

01:34:03.580 --> 01:34:05.920
And I had to beg her to stay.

01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:09.150
She thought I was going to
accuse those living outside

01:34:09.150 --> 01:34:11.720
of the continent of not being
authentic in their work.

01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:14.780
And so the only way to
answer the question,

01:34:14.780 --> 01:34:18.470
what is an African author would
have to be someone who grew

01:34:18.470 --> 01:34:20.820
up in Africa and who lives there.

01:34:20.820 --> 01:34:24.440
Such an answer today would
disqualify a very large number

01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:28.650
of those considered major
African authors or filmmakers.

01:34:28.650 --> 01:34:32.360
True, we are all made into
something different when we travel,

01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:35.630
and especially live abroad.

01:34:35.630 --> 01:34:41.130
True, the notion of authenticity or
autochthony is an anthropological

01:34:41.130 --> 01:34:45.260
and political term grounded
in outsider points of view.

01:34:45.260 --> 01:34:49.330
That is those on the outside
trying to define who is an insider

01:34:49.330 --> 01:34:53.160
and where the inside and
outside begins where it ends.

01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:55.580 position:56%
This is, as Johannes Fabian puts it,

01:34:55.580 --> 01:34:58.680
a colonial anthropological
understanding.

01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:04.660
I detest authenticity, the word
and concept, the police who tried

01:35:04.660 --> 01:35:07.450
to define it and especially
those in Africa

01:35:07.450 --> 01:35:11.020
for whom it is the test
of genuineness or not.

01:35:11.020 --> 01:35:14.150
So I was embarrassed that
she took my question so hard

01:35:14.150 --> 01:35:18.350
and I made every effort to reassure
her I meant something different.

01:35:18.350 --> 01:35:20.810
Well, what did I mean?

01:35:20.810 --> 01:35:24.710
These days, I see large swathes of
African culture as being created

01:35:24.710 --> 01:35:27.930
by those living abroad, from
Elach Nusani [assumed spelling]

01:35:27.930 --> 01:35:34.350
to Chris Abani to Pius Adesanmi,
Aminatta Forna, Chimamanda Adichie,

01:35:34.350 --> 01:35:36.530
just as I may-- might have listed--

01:35:36.530 --> 01:35:41.820
might have listed Achebe in past
years, not to mention, Teju Cole

01:35:41.820 --> 01:35:46.080
or Binyavanga Wainaina
and our own Toyin Falola.

01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:49.240
This is not to say that an
even greater contribution

01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:53.140
to African cultural production is
not being created on the continent.

01:35:53.140 --> 01:35:55.870
But those whose works are
likely to enter onto the stage

01:35:55.870 --> 01:35:59.280
of world literature or cinema
are largely living abroad.

01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:01.040
And this is not new.

01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:03.770
But it's testimony to
a changing context.

01:36:03.770 --> 01:36:07.090
And I would argue now that the
literature of Taiye Selasi,

01:36:07.090 --> 01:36:11.150
of Helen Oyeyemi, or NoViolet
Bulawayo, to mention three

01:36:11.150 --> 01:36:14.600
of the most prominent women authors
is radically different from that

01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:18.030 position:56%
of women publishing on the continent
and especially women authors

01:36:18.030 --> 01:36:21.600
of the past, like Flora
Nwapa, Mariama Ba,

01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:25.260
or even Buchi Emecheta whose
own life had been marked

01:36:25.260 --> 01:36:27.250
by beginning her career as an expat

01:36:27.250 --> 01:36:30.670
in London before returning
to Nigeria.

01:36:30.670 --> 01:36:34.820
From the outset, the great
Cameroonian author Ferdinand Oyono

01:36:34.820 --> 01:36:37.680
was living in France and
writing Une vie de boy,

01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:40.940
when Camara Laye was writing
L'Enfant noir in Paris

01:36:40.940 --> 01:36:44.870
and when Senghor and Sedar were
composing their poems in Paris,

01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:48.170
it was common for African authors
to have traveled and lived abroad

01:36:48.170 --> 01:36:51.140
where they pen much
of their early works.

01:36:51.140 --> 01:36:52.900
But that was a different time.

01:36:52.900 --> 01:36:54.630
Their crafts were marked
by an upbringing

01:36:54.630 --> 01:36:57.380
in a world radically
different from today's.

01:36:57.380 --> 01:37:01.010
Marked by colonial or
neocolonial culture and milieu,

01:37:01.010 --> 01:37:03.810
today's African authors
and [inaudible] often live

01:37:03.810 --> 01:37:06.370
in Paris and London and New York.

01:37:06.370 --> 01:37:09.170
Life and culture abroad
remains radically different

01:37:09.170 --> 01:37:12.700
from what is accessible to
Africans living at home.

01:37:12.700 --> 01:37:16.170
It isn't that African culture
isn't being diffused abroad

01:37:16.170 --> 01:37:19.380
but the flows are highly uneven.

01:37:19.380 --> 01:37:23.090
Some like Abani turned to totally
new directions of expression.

01:37:23.090 --> 01:37:26.000
Abani now calls himself a
writer, not an African writer.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:30.590
And his writing shares little with
those writing on the continent.

01:37:30.590 --> 01:37:34.320 position:56%
Others can live in New York's little
Senegal or London's Peckham Rye,

01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:38.410
eat their thieboudienne or
poulet yassa every night.

01:37:38.410 --> 01:37:41.900
Youssou N'Dour's concert in Bercy
is completely unlike the one

01:37:41.900 --> 01:37:45.500
in his home club in
Thiossane, Dakar.

01:37:45.500 --> 01:37:46.800
The food abroad for all

01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:50.280
of us doesn't taste the
same as it does at home.

01:37:50.280 --> 01:37:53.290
The music depends on its
audience for the performance

01:37:53.290 --> 01:37:56.150
to acquire its full flavor.

01:37:56.150 --> 01:37:59.200
What is ordinary at home
becomes exotic abroad.

01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:00.940
And even when the name is the same,

01:38:00.940 --> 01:38:04.450
the ingredients can
never be identical.

01:38:04.450 --> 01:38:08.890
All of these presupposes a static
culture which is never the case.

01:38:08.890 --> 01:38:12.120
The cook in New York might wind
up getting all the right flavors

01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:14.820
of pepper soup, only
to learn that the chefs

01:38:14.820 --> 01:38:19.310
in Lagos have found a better way
to make the fish taste spicy.

01:38:19.310 --> 01:38:21.350
Something new is happening.

01:38:21.350 --> 01:38:22.950
There are new conditions
of production,

01:38:22.950 --> 01:38:25.010
new times, new people on the scene.

01:38:25.010 --> 01:38:29.000
We are three generations away from
the early writers of the '50s.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:32.270
Try to imagine what the
Biafran war meant for Achebe.

01:38:32.270 --> 01:38:37.790
In his memoir, there was a country,
a personal history of Biafra.

01:38:37.790 --> 01:38:41.420
He takes, which he wrote
in 2012, he takes us back

01:38:41.420 --> 01:38:45.720
to a late British colonial
period before independence.

01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:48.890
In a radical revision
of his early fiction,

01:38:48.890 --> 01:38:51.080
he tells us the British
rule is a lot better

01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:53.630
than we imagined it to have been.

01:38:53.630 --> 01:38:55.740
Readers raised on "Things
Fall Apart"

01:38:55.740 --> 01:38:58.480
and its truths must have
been astonished to read this,

01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:02.630
Achebe with age turning more
indulgent had done so much

01:39:02.630 --> 01:39:05.550
to shape our thinking about
those early missionaries

01:39:05.550 --> 01:39:08.570
and administrators as
arrogant and small minded

01:39:08.570 --> 01:39:11.840
and had given generations
a clear understanding

01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:13.850
of Eurocentric colonial thought.

01:39:13.850 --> 01:39:16.700
The adjustment is difficult.

01:39:16.700 --> 01:39:19.970
Many of today's African
writers are in fact mixed race.

01:39:19.970 --> 01:39:23.560
When Achebe and Emecheta and
[inaudible] wrote about Biafra,

01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:29.730
none of them could have imagined a
heroine like Kainene in Adichie's

01:39:29.730 --> 01:39:36.440 position:56%
"Half Yellow Sun" whose elegance and
standoffishness redefined the image

01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:38.730
of the African urban sophisticate.

01:39:38.730 --> 01:39:40.210
It's Kainene I'm talking about.

01:39:40.210 --> 01:39:43.080
You could say that about
Adichie too if you want.

01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:44.750
She didn't care a whit.

01:39:44.750 --> 01:39:46.050
That is Kainene now.

01:39:46.050 --> 01:39:50.300
Did not care a whit for something
called evil cultural politics

01:39:50.300 --> 01:39:52.110
and the character in the novel.

01:39:52.110 --> 01:39:56.010
Instead she gave herself to a
struggle despite her wealthy

01:39:56.010 --> 01:39:57.570
and privileged upbringing.

01:39:57.570 --> 01:39:59.990
She married a white man,
a character the likes

01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:02.480
of whom it would be
impossible to find

01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:05.530
in the first two generations
of African literature.

01:40:05.530 --> 01:40:07.600
If there is a single
story of the African

01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:10.730
which Europeans have been
constructing for centuries,

01:40:10.730 --> 01:40:14.520
simultaneously there is a
single story of the European

01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:17.300
which Africans have
also constructed.

01:40:17.300 --> 01:40:21.280
That construction dissolves
as Adichie creates characters

01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:24.200
like the Englishman
Richard whose engagement

01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:27.950
with Nigerian Kainene
somehow led him

01:40:27.950 --> 01:40:30.770 position:56%
to embrace a new form of commitment.

01:40:30.770 --> 01:40:34.280
One not at all like what have
been required for those engaged

01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:37.240
in the original struggle
for national liberation

01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:40.440
as it had been during the
period of imperialism.

01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:45.530
Now, the struggle entailed a new
configuration of national economy

01:40:45.530 --> 01:40:49.090
like that of Eritrea,
South Sudan or Biafra,

01:40:49.090 --> 01:40:52.050 position:56%
for whom seeking independent freedom

01:40:52.050 --> 01:40:55.160
from the autocratic
sometimes brutal state whose

01:40:55.160 --> 01:40:57.850
by politics have reshaped
what's used

01:40:57.850 --> 01:41:01.220
to be called [foreign
language] commitment.

01:41:01.220 --> 01:41:04.070
Biafra was in fact the harbinger.

01:41:04.070 --> 01:41:08.820
The language of the new freedom
fighter, not only the new African

01:41:08.820 --> 01:41:13.150
but the new Afro-European comes
with Richard whose encounter

01:41:13.150 --> 01:41:16.880 position:56%
with other white foreigners
discombobulates their binary notions

01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:19.720
of "us" and "them"
as he plays his role

01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:22.730 position:56%
as official spokesperson for Biafra.

01:41:22.730 --> 01:41:26.390
Here's a fragment of the novelist's
depiction of Richard's encounter

01:41:26.390 --> 01:41:28.880
with two white American
journalists who come

01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:32.100
to Port Harcourt for their story.

01:41:32.100 --> 01:41:35.580
"Richard was not sure how long they
had waited before boarding their

01:41:35.580 --> 01:41:38.940
flight at Lisbon, but the wait
at Sao Tome for a relief flight

01:41:38.940 --> 01:41:41.420
to Biafra had stretched 17 hours.

01:41:41.420 --> 01:41:42.910
They needed a bath.

01:41:42.910 --> 01:41:44.570
When the plump one,
sitting next to Richard,

01:41:44.570 --> 01:41:48.300
began to talk about his first
visit to Biafra at the beginning

01:41:48.300 --> 01:41:51.860
of the war, Richard thought
he needed a mouthwash too."

01:41:51.860 --> 01:41:55.300
As we get the back story of
Richard's role in escorting them,

01:41:55.300 --> 01:41:57.340
we're provided more
and more material

01:41:57.340 --> 01:41:59.170
that signifies their difference

01:41:59.170 --> 01:42:03.640
where Richard has become
one of us and less of them.

01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:05.300
"Richard disliked him.

01:42:05.300 --> 01:42:09.290
He disliked his washed-out green
eyes and his red-freckled face.

01:42:09.290 --> 01:42:12.300 position:56%
When he had met them at the
airport and handed them their passes

01:42:12.300 --> 01:42:14.370
and told them he would
be their guide

01:42:14.370 --> 01:42:16.820
and that the Biafran
government welcomed them,

01:42:16.820 --> 01:42:20.310
he had disliked the redhead's
expression of scornful amusement.

01:42:20.310 --> 01:42:26.330 position:56%
It was as if he was saying, 'You are
speaking for the Biafrans?'" We need

01:42:26.330 --> 01:42:29.400
to remember how Cesaire
problematized his own youthful

01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:33.660 position:56%
arrogance in thinking he could speak
for his people in Fort-de-France

01:42:33.660 --> 01:42:36.870
and set that against this
reinvented global figure

01:42:36.870 --> 01:42:41.120
of a spokesperson in
a post-colonial age.

01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:43.990
Richard's whiteness changes
with his [foreign language]

01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:47.830
but [foreign language] too has
changed radically into something

01:42:47.830 --> 01:42:51.660
that we now express in terms
of the globally complex.

01:42:51.660 --> 01:42:55.360
It's to be found not in the white
American journalist scornful retort

01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:59.680
"you" speaking for the Biafrans
but rather than narrative itself

01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:05.200
that prepares us to accept
Richard's reflective self-awareness

01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:09.260 position:56%
as he judges the failures of the
two American's paltry understandings

01:43:09.260 --> 01:43:11.340
of his situation.

01:43:11.340 --> 01:43:14.660
This self-awareness translates
into his ability to put himself

01:43:14.660 --> 01:43:18.850
in their position so as
to judge its inadequacies.

01:43:18.850 --> 01:43:22.310
This is mirrored in Adichie's
ability to put herself

01:43:22.310 --> 01:43:24.790
into her white roommate's shoes

01:43:24.790 --> 01:43:27.580
in her famous TED Talk
on the single story.

01:43:27.580 --> 01:43:31.130 position:56%
Or, in the shoes of her white
character, Richard, who can also see

01:43:31.130 --> 01:43:35.720
and judge the perspective of his
fellow white racist journalists.

01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:42.040
Does the skin color still
function to create compatriots?

01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:45.540
Not so much in Adichie's
constructions.

01:43:45.540 --> 01:43:47.970
Other wonderfully constructed
white characters appear

01:43:47.970 --> 01:43:51.380
in recent fiction like, Aminatta
Forna's "Memories of Love".

01:43:51.380 --> 01:43:55.770
Where the British Dr. Adrian
has become an inverted Bintou,

01:43:55.770 --> 01:43:59.740
one who Sierra Leone has generated
and prolonged the longer he stays

01:43:59.740 --> 01:44:02.500
in Africa, in love with Mamakay.

01:44:02.500 --> 01:44:04.260
His and Richard's discourses
are new.

01:44:04.260 --> 01:44:06.280
Their complexity more compelling

01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:08.900
than the more one-sided
representation

01:44:08.900 --> 01:44:13.560
of white expat experts seen
in Soyinka's early novel,

01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:16.790
"The Interpreters", or Achebe's
white characters in "Anthills

01:44:16.790 --> 01:44:21.780
of the Savannah", Dick with Mad
Medico, who still quotes Lord Acton

01:44:21.780 --> 01:44:25.760
in establishing his difference
from colonials of the past.

01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:28.370
For me, he's part of
another single story

01:44:28.370 --> 01:44:30.890
like the white stereotype
figures of Mr. Brown

01:44:30.890 --> 01:44:34.420
and Reverend Smith in
"Things Fall Apart".

01:44:34.420 --> 01:44:37.910
In the Adichie and Forna novels,
the native guy now takes the form

01:44:37.910 --> 01:44:42.470
of enamored white men like
Richard who are positioned as "us"

01:44:42.470 --> 01:44:47.640
and "them" as figures who are
more than hybrid but now double.

01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:53.700 position:56%
They simultaneously are us and them
or at least partly so for as we all,

01:44:53.700 --> 01:44:58.110
in fact, inhabit multiple
subjectivities.

01:44:58.110 --> 01:45:02.000
In "The Thing around My
Neck", Adichie writes a story

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:05.360
about a Nigerian wife who joins
her husband in New Jersey.

01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:09.350 position:56%
Nkem raises the kids in the states
while Obiora commutes back and forth

01:45:09.350 --> 01:45:14.520
to home in Africa and has a second
bureau as they call it in Lagos.

01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:17.250
Nkem meanwhile has
become Americanized.

01:45:17.250 --> 01:45:19.910
This is how Adichie puts it.

01:45:19.910 --> 01:45:24.610
"She really belonged to this county
now, this country of curiosities

01:45:24.610 --> 01:45:27.160
and crudities, this country
where you could drive at night

01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:29.090
and not fear armed robbers,

01:45:29.090 --> 01:45:33.450
where restaurants serve one
person enough food for three."

01:45:33.450 --> 01:45:35.950
Still, she missed home.

01:45:35.950 --> 01:45:39.220
Home is conveyed through the
familiar ties of family and friends

01:45:39.220 --> 01:45:42.200 position:56%
of language and the music of speech.

01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:45.010
But it's the immediacy of
the physical environment

01:45:45.010 --> 01:45:49.110
that brings her home
to her this difference.

01:45:49.110 --> 01:45:52.600
"And when the snow covers the
yellow fire hydrant on the street,

01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:56.990
she misses the Lagos sun that
glares down even when it rains.

01:45:56.990 --> 01:45:58.980
She has sometimes thought
about moving back home

01:45:58.980 --> 01:46:01.700
but never seriously,
never concretely.

01:46:01.700 --> 01:46:05.520
She goes to a Pilates class twice
a week in Philly with her neighbor.

01:46:05.520 --> 01:46:07.730
She bakes cookies for
her children's classes

01:46:07.730 --> 01:46:09.690
and hers are always the favorites.

01:46:09.690 --> 01:46:12.330 position:56%
She expects banks to have drive-ins.

01:46:12.330 --> 01:46:16.720
America has grown on her, snaked
its roots under her skin."

01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:19.160
I like that last sentence a lot.

01:46:19.160 --> 01:46:23.450
Adichie is sensitive to the
registers of accent, culture, food,

01:46:23.450 --> 01:46:26.470
gender relations, taste,
and contemporary styles

01:46:26.470 --> 01:46:28.760
that constitute the
American presence.

01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:32.330
And her language records them in
her double consciousness at times

01:46:32.330 --> 01:46:35.550
with ironic tones, but more
often in sheep pastures

01:46:35.550 --> 01:46:38.840
and idiomatic turnings of the
phrase that render the perfect--

01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:40.450
the portrait so perfectly

01:46:40.450 --> 01:46:43.830
as to suture the native-born
American reader

01:46:43.830 --> 01:46:48.290
into the African narrator's
perspective occluding the

01:46:48.290 --> 01:46:53.340
non-narrative position, excuse me,
occluding the nonnative position

01:46:53.340 --> 01:46:55.980
of the narrative subjectivity.

01:46:55.980 --> 01:46:59.960
I'm using the cinematic term suture
to signify the identification

01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:03.980
of the spectator with the character
on the screen as specifically

01:47:03.980 --> 01:47:06.410
with the character's point of view.

01:47:06.410 --> 01:47:10.050
This is accomplished in film by
positioning the camera in the place

01:47:10.050 --> 01:47:14.010 position:56%
of the actor so that we can
experience what the character feels,

01:47:14.010 --> 01:47:17.780
fears, loves and especially
sees or doesn't see.

01:47:17.780 --> 01:47:20.270
The techniques for moving
that suture from one character

01:47:20.270 --> 01:47:24.090
to another involve camera placement
and movement as in the shot,

01:47:24.090 --> 01:47:27.490
counter shot where two characters
speaking to each other are viewed

01:47:27.490 --> 01:47:29.990
from the position of
their interlocutors

01:47:29.990 --> 01:47:33.290
with whose perspective
we come to identify.

01:47:33.290 --> 01:47:36.410
Who are we at that moment
of suture when we let go

01:47:36.410 --> 01:47:39.660
of our own real position
in the theaters?

01:47:39.660 --> 01:47:41.350
We pass in the moment of suture

01:47:41.350 --> 01:47:46.200
into what Lacan calls
meconnaissance or misrecognition.

01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:47.650
Because it constitutes us

01:47:47.650 --> 01:47:51.560 position:56%
as gathering together the fragmented
pieces of knowledge that we hold

01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:56.630
of ourselves, especially those
pieces reflected back to us

01:47:56.630 --> 01:48:00.760
in the eyes of others, whose name
for us we might wish to accept

01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:04.380
as our own and thus
to identify with.

01:48:04.380 --> 01:48:08.730
These moments of fragile and fraud
with the perils of being disrupted

01:48:08.730 --> 01:48:12.880
by a name calling, we might
not wish to acknowledge.

01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:16.450
It's most telling for the immigrant
who goes so far as to change,

01:48:16.450 --> 01:48:21.110
not only her homeland but
also her home, her home boys,

01:48:21.110 --> 01:48:26.730
her girlfriends, family, language,
status and ultimately name itself.

01:48:26.730 --> 01:48:32.050
Call me John, not John
Pierre, Jack, not jackamo,

01:48:32.050 --> 01:48:36.810
Joe not Juso, or Feller not fella.

01:48:36.810 --> 01:48:40.410
What is retained here
is the new identity

01:48:40.410 --> 01:48:43.120
which then obscures what's
responsible for making

01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:46.630
that identity in giving it reality.

01:48:46.630 --> 01:48:48.310
This is the ultimate
goal of the suture.

01:48:48.310 --> 01:48:53.330 position:56%
Its act of violence in accomplishing
the act of identification for those

01:48:53.330 --> 01:48:57.770
who take themselves to be American,
Nigerian, Senegalese or French,

01:48:57.770 --> 01:49:01.290
to be the holder of the green
card while occluding the presence

01:49:01.290 --> 01:49:05.270
of the camera that captures the
eye of the spectator or that

01:49:05.270 --> 01:49:09.200
of the narrative that
enchants the ear of the rear.

01:49:09.200 --> 01:49:12.420
The violence that springs from
this assumption of oneness

01:49:12.420 --> 01:49:16.500 position:56%
in the suture consists in forgetting
the violence involved in the act

01:49:16.500 --> 01:49:21.000
of constituting oneself
as one, as authentic.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:25.730
The suturing of the subject in the
Caine awardee Binyavanga Wainaina's

01:49:25.730 --> 01:49:28.750
"One Day I Will Write About
This Place" is complicated

01:49:28.750 --> 01:49:32.720
by the radical violence that marks
the narrator's conflictual diaspora

01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:34.710
sites of enunciation.

01:49:34.710 --> 01:49:36.010
At one moment in the text,

01:49:36.010 --> 01:49:38.240
he describes taking
the Hudson Line train

01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:41.620
into the city while Togo is
playing in the World Cup.

01:49:41.620 --> 01:49:43.510
Eyadema's corrupt family
has been put

01:49:43.510 --> 01:49:46.750
in the limelight while
stealing from the cookie jar.

01:49:46.750 --> 01:49:52.510
Wainaina's writing speaks of the
new Africa in a new global style

01:49:52.510 --> 01:49:56.000
that captures the still
existent old world of politics

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:59.310
with the old autocracies
emerging in the icy waters

01:49:59.310 --> 01:50:02.070 position:56%
of new journalistic instant texting.

01:50:02.070 --> 01:50:05.650
He's created a new story
not because of the scandal

01:50:05.650 --> 01:50:10.360
of the west preoccupation with Afro
pessimistic plucking but because

01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:13.290
of how we now desuture
ourselves from what we thought

01:50:13.290 --> 01:50:15.020
to be African literature

01:50:15.020 --> 01:50:19.630
and resuture the identification
with the reportage.

01:50:19.630 --> 01:50:23.230
"International correspondents
with their long Dictaphones,

01:50:23.230 --> 01:50:26.580
and dirty jeans, and 500
words before whiskey,

01:50:26.580 --> 01:50:29.720
are slouched over the red velvet
chairs, in the VIP section

01:50:29.720 --> 01:50:35.440 position:56%

01:51:07.640 --> 01:51:11.590
Wainana invites us to
occupy cosmopolitan spaces

01:51:11.590 --> 01:51:14.220
of language and geography.

01:51:14.220 --> 01:51:17.070
In this third generation of
African literature prose,

01:51:17.070 --> 01:51:20.070
clearly a new language
that is complete--

01:51:20.070 --> 01:51:23.080
that was completely
inaccessible to Ngugi

01:51:23.080 --> 01:51:26.450
when he imagined an authentic
cultural vehicle only

01:51:26.450 --> 01:51:28.600
in African languages.

01:51:28.600 --> 01:51:30.680
The new generation of
African women writers,

01:51:30.680 --> 01:51:34.290
particularly those living abroad
have redrawn the landscape

01:51:34.290 --> 01:51:36.550
of contemporary African
literature living

01:51:36.550 --> 01:51:39.440
and writing globally their
works offering the remarks

01:51:39.440 --> 01:51:46.240 position:56%
by the occupation of multiple
spaces and militant gender politics.

01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:50.190 position:56%
But these perspectives have been
translated into their writing styles

01:51:50.190 --> 01:51:53.240
with global settings in
Afropolitan postures.

01:51:53.240 --> 01:51:57.490
Fatou Diome and Chimamanda
Adichie addressed gender issues

01:51:57.490 --> 01:52:01.740
in ways very similar to those
employed by Aminatta Forna,

01:52:01.740 --> 01:52:05.240
Doris Baingana, Helen
Oyeyemi, Sefi Atta;

01:52:05.240 --> 01:52:10.360
they articulate subject positions
that speak directly to doubleness.

01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:13.650
Fiction like Forna's "Memories
of Love" and Adichie's "The Thing

01:52:13.650 --> 01:52:16.340
around My Neck", create
epistemologies

01:52:16.340 --> 01:52:20.030
with dual standpoints both in
terms of the past and the present,

01:52:20.030 --> 01:52:22.980
in terms of the global
north and south.

01:52:22.980 --> 01:52:26.680
They have abolished
old-school hybridity.

01:52:26.680 --> 01:52:30.240
Often it's through the
evocation of family memories

01:52:30.240 --> 01:52:31.830
that the subjective locations

01:52:31.830 --> 01:52:36.430
of immigrants today are
defined but at home and abroad.

01:52:36.430 --> 01:52:39.240
This can be seen in
Forna's "Ancestor Stones",

01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:44.410
Oyeyemi's "Icarus Girl", and
Diome's "Belly of the Atlantic".

01:52:44.410 --> 01:52:48.110
In the latter, Diome
creates a telling portrait

01:52:48.110 --> 01:52:51.240
of the dual locations
and double subjectivities

01:52:51.240 --> 01:52:54.230
of the immigrant/emigrant.

01:52:54.230 --> 01:52:57.520
She writes of her homeland in
Senegal, seen from the dark

01:52:57.520 --> 01:53:01.300
of the night in Strasbourg where
she's watching a football match

01:53:01.300 --> 01:53:03.940
which she will have to recount
in detail later to her brother

01:53:03.940 --> 01:53:06.600
who has no TV in Casamance.

01:53:06.600 --> 01:53:09.260
She too feels the pull
of here and there,

01:53:09.260 --> 01:53:11.780
the tension of the writer's
pen that seeks to put it all

01:53:11.780 --> 01:53:15.610
into place while there
are two different places,

01:53:15.610 --> 01:53:17.670
inside here and outside there.

01:53:17.670 --> 01:53:19.460
Here is how she puts it.

01:53:19.460 --> 01:53:20.760
"It's late at night.

01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:24.030
Strasbourg has lowered its
eyes to sleep or demurely

01:53:24.030 --> 01:53:26.890
to avoid watching the
intimacy of lovers

01:53:26.890 --> 01:53:29.520
and the nocturnal sorrow of others.

01:53:29.520 --> 01:53:32.200
It's always at this time
that my memory chooses

01:53:32.200 --> 01:53:36.800
to project films shown
elsewhere, under different skies,

01:53:36.800 --> 01:53:40.910
stories buried deep down
inside me like ancient mosaics

01:53:40.910 --> 01:53:44.430
in a city's subterranean tunnels.

01:53:44.430 --> 01:53:47.930
Then she speaks of her
homesickness, guilt, absence,

01:53:47.930 --> 01:53:51.540
and sadness whose lacunae she
attempts to bridge with words,

01:53:51.540 --> 01:53:55.680
her words, especially where it's
connoting travel and distance

01:53:55.680 --> 01:53:59.490
which she calls suitcase
words, words too limited

01:53:59.490 --> 01:54:03.040
to convey the miseries of
exile, words too fragile

01:54:03.040 --> 01:54:07.680
to break open the sarcophagus
that absence has cast around me,

01:54:07.680 --> 01:54:11.040
words too narrow to serve as a
bridge between here and there.

01:54:11.040 --> 01:54:15.870 position:56%
Words, then, always used in place of
absent words, definitively drowned

01:54:15.870 --> 01:54:18.650
at the font of the tears to
which they lend their taste.

01:54:18.650 --> 01:54:23.500
And finally, suitcase words
whose contents are contraband,

01:54:23.500 --> 01:54:27.770
whose meaning, despite the
detours, leads to a double life,

01:54:27.770 --> 01:54:31.000
the me from here and
the me from over there."

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:34.140
We can read this passage as
that of a shot, reverse shot,

01:54:34.140 --> 01:54:37.830
where two figures are in
dialogue and confront each other.

01:54:37.830 --> 01:54:41.390
Here, Fatou abroad,
there Fatou home,

01:54:41.390 --> 01:54:45.370
the two sides of Fatou Diome
simultaneously occupying the

01:54:45.370 --> 01:54:48.840
different locations of
the traveler's suitcase,

01:54:48.840 --> 01:54:52.320
the suitcase words, the suitcase
images, the suitcase lives.

01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:58.640
In 1994, Homi Bhabha
wanted to play subjectivity

01:54:58.640 --> 01:55:00.710
in the interstitial
space of hybridity.

01:55:00.710 --> 01:55:05.050
In the present world of globalized
traveling, the time for hybridity,

01:55:05.050 --> 01:55:08.430
for mixing, for mixing in,
is no longer available.

01:55:08.430 --> 01:55:13.000
And doubling has replaced the
interplay of otherness himself.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:17.280
As in a fugue, where traveling
is a flight from oneself,

01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:20.150
there's a crossing, the
occupancy of a space

01:55:20.150 --> 01:55:22.980
that separates two
worlds while belonging,

01:55:22.980 --> 01:55:26.660
paradoxically, in both
and in neither.

01:55:26.660 --> 01:55:30.930
An immigrant/emigrant always
occupies two subject locations

01:55:30.930 --> 01:55:34.000
but the sense of belonging
in one comes to be supplanted

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:37.230
by the physical location
of the other.

01:55:37.230 --> 01:55:41.030
Traveling shots in cinema carry
us from one location to another

01:55:41.030 --> 01:55:42.370
in order that the vision

01:55:42.370 --> 01:55:45.650
of a traveling subjectivity
could be normalized.

01:55:45.650 --> 01:55:48.510
It smooths over the
bumps in the road.

01:55:48.510 --> 01:55:51.440
Fatou says she feels free.

01:55:51.440 --> 01:55:53.730
"I want to write into
everything that--

01:55:53.730 --> 01:55:57.640
everything that my mother
didn't dare say and do.

01:55:57.640 --> 01:56:00.690
Identity papers, all
the folds of the earth,

01:56:00.690 --> 01:56:04.480
they didn't place a
birth here and now.

01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:08.470
Identity papers, my
memory is my identity."

01:56:08.470 --> 01:56:11.400
Together with her sense of
being a foreigner and stranger,

01:56:11.400 --> 01:56:15.640
her subject position returns and
splits her into a double identity

01:56:15.640 --> 01:56:20.440
of the newly constructed
subjectivity for the global frame.

01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:25.000
"An outsider everywhere, I carry an
invisible theater inside me teaming

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:26.440
with ghosts."

01:56:26.440 --> 01:56:29.850
Her subject location like
that which Gilroy defines

01:56:29.850 --> 01:56:33.540
in "Black Atlantic" is marked
by the spaces she traverses

01:56:33.540 --> 01:56:39.080
where immigration and
emigration cross with each voyage.

01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:42.100
"To leave is to die of absence.

01:56:42.100 --> 01:56:45.300
You return, of course, but
you return a different person.

01:56:45.300 --> 01:56:49.630
On going back, you seek but
never find those you left behind.

01:56:49.630 --> 01:56:52.330
Tears in your eyes, you
resign yourself to noticing

01:56:52.330 --> 01:56:55.230
that the masks you'd made
for them no longer fit.

01:56:55.230 --> 01:56:58.400
Who are these people I call
my brother and my sister?

01:56:58.400 --> 01:57:00.300
Who am I to them?

01:57:00.300 --> 01:57:03.780
The intruder who carries insider
her the woman they're waiting for,

01:57:03.780 --> 01:57:06.990
whom they despair of
ever finding again?

01:57:06.990 --> 01:57:08.290
The stranger who turns up?

01:57:08.290 --> 01:57:10.030
The sister who leaves?

01:57:10.030 --> 01:57:14.910
My dance between the two continents
is fraught with these questions."

01:57:14.910 --> 01:57:16.500
In the story "Imitation",

01:57:16.500 --> 01:57:20.640
Adichie similarly constructs a
dance between two continents.

01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:25.200 position:56%
As Obiora leaves Nkem in the US,
making frequent trips home to Lagos,

01:57:25.200 --> 01:57:28.240
her world becomes divided
and split into two homes

01:57:28.240 --> 01:57:30.670
that she cannot not occupy.

01:57:30.670 --> 01:57:35.490
Nkem describes how her neighbors
try to understand their situation

01:57:35.490 --> 01:57:39.000 position:56%
as a divided couple but their
points of reference aren't adequate.

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.320
They would ask, "'Where
was her husband?

01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:42.740
Was something wrong?'

01:57:42.740 --> 01:57:44.490
Nkem said everything is fine.

01:57:44.490 --> 01:57:48.370
He lived in Nigeria and
America; they had two homes.

01:57:48.370 --> 01:57:50.520
She saw the doubt in their
eyes, knew they were thinking

01:57:50.520 --> 01:57:54.780 position:56%
of other couples with second homes
in places like Florida and Montreal,

01:57:54.780 --> 01:57:59.330
couples who inhabited each home
at the same time, together.

01:57:59.330 --> 01:58:02.210
When Nkem speaks to the
wife of another big man

01:58:02.210 --> 01:58:05.980 position:56%
about how she managed with a similar
arrangement, and whether she planned

01:58:05.980 --> 01:58:09.800
on returning home to Nigeria, she
has asked, as the woman turned,

01:58:09.800 --> 01:58:12.550
her eyes round, as though
Nkem had just betrayed here.

01:58:12.550 --> 01:58:15.340
'But how can I live
in Nigeria again?'

01:58:15.340 --> 01:58:18.990
The woman then explains that this
change was beyond her control.

01:58:18.990 --> 01:58:21.270
'When you've been here so
long, you're not the same,

01:58:21.270 --> 01:58:22.780
you're not like the people there.'

01:58:22.780 --> 01:58:25.800
'How can my children blend in?'

01:58:25.800 --> 01:58:30.250
And Nkem, although she disliked the
woman's severely shaved eyebrows,

01:58:30.250 --> 01:58:31.550
had understood."

01:58:31.550 --> 01:58:34.410
In the works of these
African women writers,

01:58:34.410 --> 01:58:38.590
there's a strong undercurrent
of loss that draws attention

01:58:38.590 --> 01:58:40.790
to their double subjectivity.

01:58:40.790 --> 01:58:43.970
The pain of this loss creates
accounts for the world of this--

01:58:43.970 --> 01:58:47.510
for the work of the suture and
the melodramatic effect to stitch

01:58:47.510 --> 01:58:52.060
over loss through the doubling
of the subject's position.

01:58:52.060 --> 01:58:54.210
In this new age, doubling
is the condition

01:58:54.210 --> 01:58:56.750
for traveling subjectivities.

01:58:56.750 --> 01:59:00.410
The African labor force travels
often dangerously between Africa

01:59:00.410 --> 01:59:03.260
and the west, as the
same time as the wealthy,

01:59:03.260 --> 01:59:07.190
highly educated Afropolitans
jet set between

01:59:07.190 --> 01:59:11.100
and in their adopted
and original homes.

01:59:11.100 --> 01:59:16.200
For the immigrant, the original
homeland becomes a ghostly presence

01:59:16.200 --> 01:59:20.950
while the adopted one remains
a continually moving target.

01:59:20.950 --> 01:59:25.620
The homeland is changed, it
shifts, they wear strange hats,

01:59:25.620 --> 01:59:28.070 position:56%
red on one side, black on the other.

01:59:28.070 --> 01:59:33.050
That deluded think they could
recognize the owner of the house.

01:59:33.050 --> 01:59:36.570
Where on earth is this
new-old homeland?

01:59:36.570 --> 01:59:39.610
For Teju Cole, it is
a moving target.

01:59:39.610 --> 01:59:45.450
According to the 2011 "Open City",
which is Cole's famous novel,

01:59:45.450 --> 01:59:48.910
"Open City", the random house
blurb, he was raised in Nigeria

01:59:48.910 --> 01:59:52.030
and came to the US in 1992.

01:59:52.030 --> 01:59:54.620
Notice the hat.

01:59:54.620 --> 01:59:57.420
And he lives in New York City.

01:59:57.420 --> 02:00:00.780
His public persona now embellished
with his New York Times column

02:00:00.780 --> 02:00:04.420
on photography is close to what
we imagined the protagonist

02:00:04.420 --> 02:00:07.040
of the novel, Julius, to be.

02:00:07.040 --> 02:00:11.820
Cole publishes for the New Yorker,
he is hipness, come to the center.

02:00:11.820 --> 02:00:14.570
On the jacket of an earlier
novel, his earlier novel,

02:00:14.570 --> 02:00:18.710
"Every Day Is for the Thief", we
learned something astonishing.

02:00:18.710 --> 02:00:21.140
Namely, that the Cole
who came to the US

02:00:21.140 --> 02:00:26.250
in '92 had already been
born there in 1975.

02:00:26.250 --> 02:00:29.440
So that when the Cole of "Open
City" is presented to the reader

02:00:29.440 --> 02:00:33.050
as essentially a Nigerian who
immigrated to New York City

02:00:33.050 --> 02:00:38.070 position:56%
like his hero Julius, we are being
instructed to read the novel as that

02:00:38.070 --> 02:00:42.320
of an outsider who has refashioned
himself as a New York sophisticate,

02:00:42.320 --> 02:00:48.040
whereas in truth, Cole was always
already that insider-outsider born

02:00:48.040 --> 02:00:51.320
in Kalamazoo, Michigan,
of all places.

02:00:51.320 --> 02:00:54.630
I see that as a spark.

02:00:54.630 --> 02:00:56.900
Moreover, his website
stipulates he was born

02:00:56.900 --> 02:00:59.420
to Nigerian parents
and raised in Nigeria.

02:00:59.420 --> 02:01:00.970
So the question might really be,

02:01:00.970 --> 02:01:06.410
depending on where one
stands, is he an Oyinbo or not.

02:01:06.410 --> 02:01:10.260
In "Open City", Julius' people
on the father side are Yoruba.

02:01:10.260 --> 02:01:14.150 position:56%
And we know that in the best of ways
since his father is buried in Lagos.

02:01:14.150 --> 02:01:15.660
On his mother side, it's German,

02:01:15.660 --> 02:01:18.950
the side where the loss
appears most to mark him.

02:01:18.950 --> 02:01:24.790
In New York, Belgium, or Lagos, he
remains distant, never [inaudible].

02:01:24.790 --> 02:01:27.590
At one point in "Every
Day Is for the Thief",

02:01:27.590 --> 02:01:29.480
he goes to the city market.

02:01:29.480 --> 02:01:32.670
The essence of the city where
he is in search of himself,

02:01:32.670 --> 02:01:35.950
or as he states, "If he'll
refuse to go to market,

02:01:35.950 --> 02:01:37.850
how would you know the
existence of others?

02:01:37.850 --> 02:01:40.720
How would you know of
your own existence?"

02:01:40.720 --> 02:01:43.270
But the answer in the
market comes quickly,

02:01:43.270 --> 02:01:48.230
depending on whether you were there
to buy tomatoes or garri or masks.

02:01:48.230 --> 02:01:49.780
In this case, it was the latter.

02:01:49.780 --> 02:01:54.680
And the distance this implied
came back to him immediately,

02:01:54.680 --> 02:01:57.470
"When I started speaking Yoruba,
the man I've been haggling

02:01:57.470 --> 02:02:00.920
with over some carved
masks laughs nervously.

02:02:00.920 --> 02:02:03.910
Ah oga, he says, 'I didn't
know you knew the language,

02:02:03.910 --> 02:02:07.980
I took you for an oyinbo,
or an Ibo man."

02:02:07.980 --> 02:02:10.550
Teju, narrated, is irritated.

02:02:10.550 --> 02:02:14.130
Not at the man's mistaken
attribution, who would want

02:02:14.130 --> 02:02:17.110
to be taken for an
outsider in one's own home,

02:02:17.110 --> 02:02:21.060
but rather at his relatively
correct automatic perception,

02:02:21.060 --> 02:02:23.750
"'What subtle tells of dress

02:02:23.750 --> 02:02:27.970
or body language have again
given me a way,' he asks.

02:02:27.970 --> 02:02:30.330
This kind of thing didn't
happen when I lived here,

02:02:30.330 --> 02:02:33.080
when I used to pass through
this very market on the way

02:02:33.080 --> 02:02:36.420
to my exam preparation lessons."

02:02:36.420 --> 02:02:38.470
Some subtle shift in the direction

02:02:38.470 --> 02:02:43.720 position:56%
of the west has now tainted his skin
color as the words for outsider,

02:02:43.720 --> 02:02:47.480
white man, other, rich
man coalesce around him

02:02:47.480 --> 02:02:49.860
in the very heart of home.

02:02:49.860 --> 02:02:52.480
He is subject to the
same treatment according

02:02:52.480 --> 02:02:56.110
to Saidiya Hartman whose
return home is to Ghana,

02:02:56.110 --> 02:02:58.840
where her ancestors come from.

02:02:58.840 --> 02:03:01.080
Life of Teju, Julius narrated,

02:03:01.080 --> 02:03:04.690
Saidiya also an academic
is somehow betrayed

02:03:04.690 --> 02:03:07.250
by her absence of local color.

02:03:07.250 --> 02:03:09.980
And when approaching
Cape Coast Castle

02:03:09.980 --> 02:03:13.860
for the ultimate homecoming
tourist experience, she is treated

02:03:13.860 --> 02:03:18.210
with Oburoni, which she
glosses as outsider.

02:03:18.210 --> 02:03:20.380
Of course, she's mistranslating.

02:03:20.380 --> 02:03:23.480
Not willing to confess to
herself much less to us

02:03:23.480 --> 02:03:26.650
that she's being called
the same thing as Oyinbo.

02:03:26.650 --> 02:03:30.320
The urban dictionary
on Oburoni is astute.

02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:34.780 position:56%
Oburoni is the tree word for a white
person but sometimes used to refer

02:03:34.780 --> 02:03:36.690
to foreigners in general.

02:03:36.690 --> 02:03:39.200
The words often used by
Ghanaians in the diaspora,

02:03:39.200 --> 02:03:43.320
when speaking amongst themselves
as a code word for white man.

02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:46.400
Despite the relatively widespread
and casual use of the word,

02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:50.430
its origins are not entirely
benign, the word Oburoni derives

02:03:50.430 --> 02:03:54.060
from the word aburofo
which means trickster.

02:03:54.060 --> 02:03:57.810
In "Every Day Is for the
Thief", the text self-translates,

02:03:57.810 --> 02:04:01.510
giving us the authenticating
terms like oga while

02:04:01.510 --> 02:04:06.180
at the same time not only glossing
but interpreting the usage.

02:04:06.180 --> 02:04:10.600
"The masks are beautiful, but the
price he's asking is exorbitant.

02:04:10.600 --> 02:04:12.590
I leave his shop and move on.

02:04:12.590 --> 02:04:13.890
Other vendors call me.

02:04:13.890 --> 02:04:17.820
Oga, boss, look my side now,
I go give una good price.

02:04:17.820 --> 02:04:20.820
Others simply call out,
oyinbo, white man."

02:04:20.820 --> 02:04:24.270
At this point, the
narrator turns tour guide.

02:04:24.270 --> 02:04:29.530
"Young men sit in the interior
of the small stalls on rafia mats

02:04:29.530 --> 02:04:31.880
or on low stools, their
limbs unfurled.

02:04:31.880 --> 02:04:35.260
I move through the warren
shops, which like a souk is cool

02:04:35.260 --> 02:04:38.680
and overstuffed, delighting
in its own tacky variety,

02:04:38.680 --> 02:04:43.140
spilling seamlessly into
the cavernous indoor shop."

02:04:43.140 --> 02:04:47.330
The writing here is become novel
souk, describing itself much

02:04:47.330 --> 02:04:51.100
as we had expect from the
creative writing student.

02:04:51.100 --> 02:04:55.130
And we remembered this is Cole's
first foray into long fiction,

02:04:55.130 --> 02:04:57.580
written after his return
home to western Michigan,

02:04:57.580 --> 02:05:01.150
and then Kalamazoo College
for his undergrad years.

02:05:01.150 --> 02:05:04.510
Cole throbs on the notion
of home self-consciously.

02:05:04.510 --> 02:05:07.780
His sense of being away then
back, though still mentally away,

02:05:07.780 --> 02:05:10.860
emerges when he mentions
a friend named Ben,

02:05:10.860 --> 02:05:14.000
to his Aunt Folake and Uncle Bello.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:17.720
His uncle tells him, he's
a good man, this Ben,

02:05:17.720 --> 02:05:19.690
pretty hard working, conscientious.

02:05:19.690 --> 02:05:21.670
He's Ogoni, you know.

02:05:21.670 --> 02:05:24.550
A young Teju narrator then
expostulates to his uncle

02:05:24.550 --> 02:05:28.520
about the hard times the Ogoni
and Saro-Wiwa have experienced.

02:05:28.520 --> 02:05:33.290
The response he receives is given
in Yoruba and translated for us.

02:05:33.290 --> 02:05:35.790
"Aren't they the ones
who eat people?

02:05:35.790 --> 02:05:38.160
Now, eating people might
be taken several ways

02:05:38.160 --> 02:05:41.250
but what's most commonly
understood is that it's witches

02:05:41.250 --> 02:05:45.400
who eat people especially at night
when their windows are left open.

02:05:45.400 --> 02:05:49.900 position:56%
Those most likely to engage in this
devouring are those nearest to home,

02:05:49.900 --> 02:05:52.700
close relatives because that's
the Native Cameroon say,

02:05:52.700 --> 02:05:56.750
there was jambe, the strongest
witchcraft is jambe [inaudible],

02:05:56.750 --> 02:05:59.390
the witchcraft of home.

02:05:59.390 --> 02:06:01.810
Teju, narrator, plays
the Oyinbo role perfectly

02:06:01.810 --> 02:06:04.040 position:56%
in his response to his own relative.

02:06:04.040 --> 02:06:05.940
"Oh come on, Uncle, come on, I say,

02:06:05.940 --> 02:06:09.210
why are you Nigerians
so fond of rumors.

02:06:09.210 --> 02:06:12.900
We, what I mean is you, are
so tribalistic sometimes.

02:06:12.900 --> 02:06:18.560
And anyway, don't our Yoruba people
also have some kingship-related

02:06:18.560 --> 02:06:23.200
and grimly nonvegetarian ritual?"

02:06:23.200 --> 02:06:26.100
Uncle Bello then left and
treats Teju, narrator,

02:06:26.100 --> 02:06:29.750
to story about an albino
being eaten in Ondo State

02:06:29.750 --> 02:06:33.990
in some fairly remote
region near the tribals.

02:06:33.990 --> 02:06:38.240
Our youthful narrator's
eyes widened and we read,

02:06:38.240 --> 02:06:42.950
"The particular Yoruba choice of
words made the story even funnier."

02:06:42.950 --> 02:06:46.960
The global reader can
appreciate that.

02:06:46.960 --> 02:06:54.730
The refusal to translate directly
the words [foreign language] leaves

02:06:54.730 --> 02:06:59.210
us outside and inside
doubles in the sense

02:06:59.210 --> 02:07:03.220
that we can't entirely represent
the local reader wanting to share

02:07:03.220 --> 02:07:06.960
in the pleasure of the words
nuances, yet sure enough

02:07:06.960 --> 02:07:09.920
as the outsider being
presented with his most delicate

02:07:09.920 --> 02:07:12.940
of insider African
secret tale-telling

02:07:12.940 --> 02:07:16.510
that we should not really believe
but maybe believe all the worst

02:07:16.510 --> 02:07:19.970 position:56%
of the tribals, whatever that means.

02:07:19.970 --> 02:07:24.560
With the shift from you Nigerians
to we, what I mean is you,

02:07:24.560 --> 02:07:26.750
we are asked to share
the joke and laughter

02:07:26.750 --> 02:07:30.850
as though the author were
one of us or we one of them.

02:07:30.850 --> 02:07:35.100
The outsider really brought
into the fold, the insider knows

02:07:35.100 --> 02:07:38.920
that he cannot write this book
without a glance over his shoulder

02:07:38.920 --> 02:07:42.720
to some remote tribal community.

02:07:42.720 --> 02:07:49.170
To end with the words of [foreign
language], "I think it's important

02:07:49.170 --> 02:07:51.990
to be on the right side of history
and that means coming to terms

02:07:51.990 --> 02:07:56.450
with the fact that our faith isn't
written in a foreign language

02:07:56.450 --> 02:07:58.300
but in our own languages."

02:07:58.300 --> 02:08:02.710
But what is that language
for Adichie, for Cole,

02:08:02.710 --> 02:08:05.450
for any of us who might
be each in his

02:08:05.450 --> 02:08:10.060
or her own way not a
speaker of just one language.

02:08:10.060 --> 02:08:13.610
Not someone who can lay
claim to just one home.

02:08:13.610 --> 02:08:15.510
Thank you.

02:08:15.510 --> 02:08:22.330
[ Applause ]

02:08:22.330 --> 02:08:23.630
&gt;&gt; Toyin Falola: Thank
you very much.

02:08:23.630 --> 02:08:27.720
I wanted to raise the
issues of audience.

02:08:27.720 --> 02:08:34.610
Who is the new generation,
what they're writing for?

02:08:35.640 --> 02:08:38.370
And issues on our own
African languages.

02:08:38.370 --> 02:08:41.810
But time is not on us our side.

02:08:41.810 --> 02:08:43.120
We still have one more speaker.

02:08:43.120 --> 02:08:49.390
And we want to invite the
audience to also participate.

02:08:49.390 --> 02:08:56.780 position:56%
I want to invite him, Professor
Bangura to talk about Islam in terms

02:08:56.780 --> 02:09:01.970
of how it plays out with these
new contemporary immigrants.

02:09:01.970 --> 02:09:04.270
Professor Bangura.

02:09:05.510 --> 02:09:09.500
[ Applause ]

02:09:14.470 --> 02:09:16.770
&gt;&gt; Abdul Karim Bangura: OK.

02:09:31.470 --> 02:09:39.180
Because of time, we'll make it
shorter than I had anticipated.

02:09:39.180 --> 02:09:44.270
And hopefully, there'll be other
opportunities some other time.

02:09:44.270 --> 02:09:47.040
But first, I want to just
to make quick corrections

02:09:47.040 --> 02:09:50.640
on the brief bios you have.

02:09:50.640 --> 02:09:55.550 position:56%
I am no longer a professor at
American University for a long time.

02:09:55.550 --> 02:09:57.770
I'm still with the
Center for Global Peace.

02:09:57.770 --> 02:10:00.190
I don't want some young
person registering for a cause

02:10:00.190 --> 02:10:03.240
and looking for me all over campus.

02:10:03.240 --> 02:10:06.440
And I'm no longer also
the ambassador

02:10:06.440 --> 02:10:10.700
of the ATWS to the United Nations.

02:10:10.700 --> 02:10:13.870
This is what happens when we gain
information from the internet.

02:10:13.870 --> 02:10:17.640
Some of this information
can be quite dated.

02:10:17.640 --> 02:10:22.410
Just so that, I don't get
into trouble with anybody.

02:10:26.140 --> 02:10:29.400
Let's contextualize.

02:10:29.400 --> 02:10:35.260
The first thing we learn
about African Muslims

02:10:35.260 --> 02:10:40.810
in the United States usually
begin with the slave trade.

02:10:40.810 --> 02:10:49.040 position:56%
How they came in tight ships and how
Soliman Job, this is the ancestor

02:10:49.040 --> 02:10:53.220
of my mother from Futa Jallon.

02:10:53.220 --> 02:10:56.070
So it's not just the Banguras
are the kings in potluck

02:10:56.070 --> 02:10:59.180
but my mother also come
from very high royalty.

02:10:59.180 --> 02:11:02.750
I see Peter is laughing back there.

02:11:02.750 --> 02:11:08.230
And we already saw the
PBS series on Abdurakman,

02:11:08.230 --> 02:11:11.200
which went on for two weeks.

02:11:11.200 --> 02:11:15.200
And we all know the famous
story about the Amistad

02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:18.960
in a greatly extensive learn and
give the Amistad lecture on that.

02:11:18.960 --> 02:11:22.720
You can get out on the internet.

02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:27.720
And we also know about the
Islamic connections to the Amistad.

02:11:27.720 --> 02:11:33.590
We are asked-- even the pastors
that went to examine the busqu,

02:11:33.590 --> 02:11:38.070
we are being taught
about Christianity,

02:11:38.070 --> 02:11:41.140
about Muslims they
encountered in the place.

02:11:41.140 --> 02:11:45.020
And we also know that the
Yoruba Muslims and [inaudible]

02:11:45.020 --> 02:11:50.260 position:56%
in particular were very instrumental
in the reeducation of the Amistad

02:11:50.260 --> 02:11:53.450
when they returned to Sierra Leone.

02:11:55.890 --> 02:12:02.690
And when we talk about the African
presence is very well-established,

02:12:02.690 --> 02:12:08.670
is well-noted and many times,
many of these facts were denied

02:12:08.670 --> 02:12:14.390
by Eurocentric scholars,
that we have myths

02:12:14.390 --> 02:12:16.430
that Africans scholars were making.

02:12:16.430 --> 02:12:22.390
We know about the great
documents of the Piri Reis.

02:12:22.390 --> 02:12:28.740
We know about the Qatar Emir
[assumed spelling] even its own

02:12:28.740 --> 02:12:32.880
document of China, and a lot

02:12:32.880 --> 02:12:37.220
of other historical
evidence that has been birth.

02:12:37.220 --> 02:12:45.620
But until the PBS and the BBC
corroborated what many African

02:12:45.620 --> 02:12:50.980
scholars were saying, these things
were rejected as just myths,

02:12:50.980 --> 02:12:53.180
that Africans wanted to feel good

02:12:53.180 --> 02:12:56.160
and that's why we're
talking about these things.

02:12:56.160 --> 02:13:00.240
And the reconstruction by
the PBS on the possibility

02:13:00.240 --> 02:13:04.310
of how King Abu Bakri
could have sailed from Mali

02:13:04.310 --> 02:13:07.930
to here is well-documented.

02:13:07.930 --> 02:13:12.790
And yes, the PBS series on that.

02:13:12.790 --> 02:13:17.640
And the great calling power as
you see the quote felt at home,

02:13:17.640 --> 02:13:21.830
said I'm an American, though when
he stepped foot on Bunce Island,

02:13:21.830 --> 02:13:24.000
he felt that spiritual connection.

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:28.390
And this is what many of us who
are pan-African is always striving

02:13:28.390 --> 02:13:30.640
to get our people connected
on both sides

02:13:30.640 --> 02:13:34.520
of the islands of the Atlantic.

02:13:34.520 --> 02:13:43.910 position:56%
So, quickly to understand the
African Muslim in the United States,

02:13:43.910 --> 02:13:47.730
to contextualize the African
Muslim in the United States,

02:13:47.730 --> 02:13:54.840
we go back to Hajar
or Hagar in English.

02:13:54.840 --> 02:13:59.380
And being a Muslim, I'm
attending a Roman Catholic school

02:13:59.380 --> 02:14:03.630
and served mass as an altar boy,
I was fortunate to study my Bible

02:14:03.630 --> 02:14:06.700
from beginning to end, end
to beginning and won the love

02:14:06.700 --> 02:14:09.980
of Bible scholarships and awards.

02:14:09.980 --> 02:14:14.400
I love the Bible so much while
I still studied my Koran.

02:14:14.400 --> 02:14:20.970
And I was fortunate when I study
in Italy to be supported by rabbis

02:14:20.970 --> 02:14:25.260
and had no choice but in respect
for the people who give me food

02:14:25.260 --> 02:14:29.530
and shelter to study Judaism.

02:14:29.530 --> 02:14:33.430
And I then began to learn more
about this great African woman

02:14:33.430 --> 02:14:41.470
and how she connected
Christianity, Islam, and Judaism.

02:14:41.470 --> 02:14:45.510 position:56%
And if you-- those of you who are
familiar with the Hebrew Pentateuch,

02:14:45.510 --> 02:14:50.680
you can see the story from
Genesis, 13 through 17.

02:14:50.680 --> 02:14:58.700
For those of you who are familiar
with the Holy Bible particularly

02:14:58.700 --> 02:15:02.260
in Galatians, don't just limit
yourself to Matthew, Mark,

02:15:02.260 --> 02:15:06.310
Luke and John, you begin to see
where the connection is made

02:15:06.310 --> 02:15:11.040 position:56%
that Abraham went on and built the
Kaaba, which we Muslims do the honor

02:15:11.040 --> 02:15:15.980
as a very sacred place for our
[inaudible], our way of living

02:15:15.980 --> 02:15:18.720
and how he constructed it.

02:15:18.720 --> 02:15:23.770
Many, us, Christians don't
read far past those four books,

02:15:23.770 --> 02:15:26.150
so we are not exposed
to that knowledge.

02:15:26.150 --> 02:15:30.110
And when we read our Holy Koran, we
see the reconstruction of what is

02:15:30.110 --> 02:15:33.670
in the Pentateuch all the way
to the Galatians to the Bible

02:15:33.670 --> 02:15:38.840
and how Ishmael became the
father of the Ishmaelite

02:15:38.840 --> 02:15:41.380 position:56%
from which Prophet Muhammad emerged.

02:15:41.380 --> 02:15:44.300
So, when we talk about
the African roots to Islam

02:15:44.300 --> 02:15:49.890
and the transcendentalization
of Islam, we Africans,

02:15:49.890 --> 02:15:55.260
we black folks are in the
center of this great experience.

02:15:55.260 --> 02:15:59.980
And there's a great book Pentateuch
called "Libre de la Biblia",

02:15:59.980 --> 02:16:03.510
which explains some
of these connections

02:16:03.510 --> 02:16:08.460
and there's another great Italian
book "Il Vangelo e la Torah",

02:16:08.460 --> 02:16:11.110
that is the gospel and the Torah.

02:16:11.110 --> 02:16:13.620
That makes these connections.

02:16:13.620 --> 02:16:19.060
And of course there is the
great "In Ascorto del la tora",

02:16:19.060 --> 02:16:21.720 position:56%
which is the listening to the Torah,

02:16:21.720 --> 02:16:25.740
which also make these wonderful
connections, for those people

02:16:25.740 --> 02:16:28.700
who are more interested in
learning about these things.

02:16:28.700 --> 02:16:37.280 position:56%
I say that to say, to give a
background of why we African Muslims

02:16:37.280 --> 02:16:44.260
or black Muslims are very
fortunate, very fortunate,

02:16:44.260 --> 02:16:48.800
because we find ourselves in a
land that has a lot of tolerance

02:16:48.800 --> 02:16:53.350
for religion even though there
are certain schisms every now

02:16:53.350 --> 02:16:55.650
and then that emerge.

02:16:56.830 --> 02:17:01.770
And we can then say,
how has Africans

02:17:01.770 --> 02:17:06.520
or African Muslims
made these connections?

02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:15.440 position:56%
We can begin by looking at the
transnationalism of African Muslims,

02:17:15.440 --> 02:17:22.780
that is an African Muslim
that is African-centered.

02:17:22.780 --> 02:17:29.470
And as the great scholar
Molefi Kete Asante

02:17:29.470 --> 02:17:35.670
of Temple University tells us,
African centrism involves placing

02:17:35.670 --> 02:17:40.790
at the center of every
discourse of the African,

02:17:40.790 --> 02:17:43.960
whether on the continent or
in the diaspora at the center

02:17:43.960 --> 02:17:47.020
of that particular discourse.

02:17:47.020 --> 02:17:50.690
And we also know

02:17:50.690 --> 02:18:07.700
that African-centered encounters
go back to the Tariq ibn Ziyad.

02:18:07.700 --> 02:18:14.270
We all know that Ziyad
not only funded some

02:18:14.270 --> 02:18:22.270
of the great Islamic schools,
the Moorish Science Temple

02:18:22.270 --> 02:18:25.190
for example in Newark, New Jersey.

02:18:25.190 --> 02:18:32.950
On that, the great Noble Drew was
funded by this Moorish gentleman.

02:18:32.950 --> 02:18:37.850
We also know and Professor
Omoyeni Falola just mentioned

02:18:37.850 --> 02:18:44.460
in briefly passing
that the great Wilmot,

02:18:44.460 --> 02:18:52.640
Edward Wilmot Blyden
was very instrumental

02:18:52.640 --> 02:19:02.040 position:56%
in creating a connection between the
African and the Islamic religion.

02:19:02.040 --> 02:19:04.610
Even going to the fact that he
preferred, even though he was--

02:19:04.610 --> 02:19:07.570
is a Christian, even
going to the fact arguing

02:19:07.570 --> 02:19:14.560 position:56%
that he preferred blacks or Africans
to embrace Islam over Christianity.

02:19:15.970 --> 02:19:27.710
And we also know that there
are certain challenges,

02:19:27.710 --> 02:19:31.690
modes of challenges that
African Muslims encounter

02:19:31.690 --> 02:19:34.010
in this part of the world.

02:19:34.010 --> 02:19:40.610 position:56%
They encounter continuous especially
in the areas of environmental

02:19:40.610 --> 02:19:45.270
and attitudinal concerns.

02:19:46.850 --> 02:19:58.540
We see how since the very vicious
terrorist act of September 11,

02:19:58.540 --> 02:20:03.610
how Muslims, not just Muslims
from the Middle East and East Asia

02:20:03.610 --> 02:20:06.960
but African Muslims also have
encountered the same sort

02:20:06.960 --> 02:20:16.240
of harassment, the same sort of
deportation in very large numbers

02:20:16.240 --> 02:20:20.970
than compared to all
the non-Muslim Africans.

02:20:26.210 --> 02:20:35.520
We also see factors that impact
the success of African Muslims.

02:20:35.520 --> 02:20:43.310
These include cultural, economic,
political and sociological factors.

02:20:43.310 --> 02:20:53.310
We see that even our government
have gone to the extent

02:20:53.310 --> 02:21:00.560
of imposing discriminatory
security checks for all Muslims

02:21:00.560 --> 02:21:09.930
who would be entering the country
at 115 airports, 14 seaports

02:21:09.930 --> 02:21:15.130
and these are usually entry
points for many African Muslims

02:21:15.130 --> 02:21:17.640
that come to the society.

02:21:18.770 --> 02:21:24.410
The challenges for
the role of the State,

02:21:24.410 --> 02:21:27.210
we see that the State has
some challenges dealing

02:21:27.210 --> 02:21:29.890
with African Muslims.

02:21:31.110 --> 02:21:36.860 position:56%
This seemed to be most predominantly
targeted at African Muslims

02:21:36.860 --> 02:21:39.940
than other Africans, both in terms

02:21:39.940 --> 02:21:43.970
of the politics and
in the legal arena.

02:21:43.970 --> 02:21:51.100
And these were documented by even
the United State government itself

02:21:51.100 --> 02:21:57.960 position:56%
in targeting of certain groups that
send phones to communities in Africa

02:21:57.960 --> 02:22:01.470
where they support
Muslim organizations.

02:22:01.470 --> 02:22:07.100
And we had the hijab
as even legally stated

02:22:07.100 --> 02:22:14.980
as a trigger for security checks.

02:22:17.430 --> 02:22:20.950
But with all these challenges,
there are also opportunities

02:22:20.950 --> 02:22:25.610
that have come with them.

02:22:25.610 --> 02:22:30.640
Unfortunately, the time is not on
our side so this may be a rush job.

02:22:30.640 --> 02:22:33.900
I apologize.

02:22:33.900 --> 02:22:42.060
I was able to delineate
nine particular aspects

02:22:42.060 --> 02:22:45.630
where new challenges have emerged

02:22:45.630 --> 02:22:51.020
and where opportunities
have also come to the floor.

02:22:51.020 --> 02:22:55.520
And Muslim and non-Muslim
relations but for us

02:22:55.520 --> 02:23:03.360
to understand these aspects, we
have to not only rely on one theory

02:23:03.360 --> 02:23:06.400
but in multiplicity of theories

02:23:06.400 --> 02:23:10.700
and methodologies for
us to examine this.

02:23:10.700 --> 02:23:15.800
When Omoyeni Falola asked me to be
part of this, I started writing.

02:23:15.800 --> 02:23:21.150
Believe it or not, I end up
writing 85 pages of a paper

02:23:22.170 --> 02:23:25.910
and I just started
scratching the surface

02:23:25.910 --> 02:23:30.700
because there was a whole lot
more that I have to leave out.

02:23:30.700 --> 02:23:39.930
And here, you can just
quickly see our definition

02:23:39.930 --> 02:23:44.510
of the American family,
Christian white middle class.

02:23:44.510 --> 02:23:47.790
The ideal family has evolved
though with the father who works

02:23:47.790 --> 02:23:49.120
as a manager in [inaudible].

02:23:49.120 --> 02:23:51.860
They want you to slap you.

02:23:51.860 --> 02:23:57.730
They kiss mother if you kick
them on the sheen and 2.5 kids.

02:23:57.730 --> 02:24:02.200
And as a recent methodologist, I
am still looking for that half kid.

02:24:02.200 --> 02:24:06.050
It's possible statistically but
in reality, it is impossible.

02:24:06.050 --> 02:24:09.480
I keep looking for the
kid without a head.

02:24:09.480 --> 02:24:11.170
And that goes spell well

02:24:11.170 --> 02:24:16.470
for the Muslim definition
of what a family is.

02:24:16.470 --> 02:24:20.950
And so, they are sometimes
starting conflicts.

02:24:20.950 --> 02:24:26.780
And even the hijab becomes a
problem, this social identity.

02:24:28.030 --> 02:24:29.490
So what's our real work?

02:24:29.490 --> 02:24:31.790
Of course--

02:24:40.520 --> 02:24:45.950
Omoyeni Falola is now
checking for his time.

02:24:47.770 --> 02:24:58.210
Cultural relativism, yeah we
have the hijab, the great Maryam,

02:24:58.210 --> 02:25:00.470
the number one revered
woman in Islam.

02:25:00.470 --> 02:25:04.250
As a mater of fact,
the Surah Maryam is one

02:25:04.250 --> 02:25:07.950
of the most beautiful
surahs in the Koran.

02:25:07.950 --> 02:25:12.510
And what we, Christian did
was we cut it into half.

02:25:12.510 --> 02:25:15.080
Hail Mary, Mother of
Grace, you know.

02:25:15.080 --> 02:25:16.400
It is good.

02:25:16.400 --> 02:25:21.790
But I got to read beyond that
to appreciate the great Maryam.

02:25:21.790 --> 02:25:23.690
Mother Teresa, we all love her.

02:25:23.690 --> 02:25:28.260
She wears a hijab.

02:25:28.260 --> 02:25:32.880
And you see all these great
African-- these Muslim women.

02:25:32.880 --> 02:25:37.070
They wear hijab and some
choose not to wear hijab.

02:25:37.070 --> 02:25:42.800
All of a sudden, hijab is
now something suspicious.

02:25:42.800 --> 02:25:53.080
We also see challenges in
integrating Muslims in America.

02:25:53.080 --> 02:25:57.580
And then you see, I
gave you a theory,

02:25:57.580 --> 02:26:02.030
a methodology that I have meant to
do that and I have all the results.

02:26:02.030 --> 02:26:04.260
So, whoever is interested,
send me an email.

02:26:04.260 --> 02:26:07.770 position:56%
I'll be happy to send you the paper.

02:26:07.770 --> 02:26:15.220
So I will conclude by saying
that a people who emerged

02:26:15.220 --> 02:26:23.040
from the great Hagar or Hajar, a
people who today have the leader

02:26:23.040 --> 02:26:33.670
or the Chief Imam, the sheikh of
the grand mosque in Saudi Arabia,

02:26:33.670 --> 02:26:39.890
have a whole lot of things to
hope for despite the trials

02:26:39.890 --> 02:26:43.370
and the tribulations
and the challenges.

02:26:43.370 --> 02:26:48.070
And I conclude with
a very short story,

02:26:48.070 --> 02:26:54.420
as soon as Donald Trump won the
election, I have two web pages,

02:26:54.420 --> 02:26:59.590
my own person web page on Facebook

02:26:59.590 --> 02:27:04.550
and the African Books Heritage
web page, one of the folks

02:27:04.550 --> 02:27:09.460
on my web page wrote,
"For you Muslims

02:27:09.460 --> 02:27:13.590
who have been badmouthing
Donald Trump,

02:27:13.590 --> 02:27:17.410
now that he has won the
election, is people are going

02:27:17.410 --> 02:27:21.100
to be searching your Facebook pages

02:27:22.620 --> 02:27:26.830
and you might find
yourself deported.

02:27:31.050 --> 02:27:37.760
The next day, I went and checked at
those websites of all those folks

02:27:37.760 --> 02:27:42.850
who were writing so many
bad things about the Donald.

02:27:42.850 --> 02:27:52.040
And I am not lying to you,
all of them had deleted all

02:27:52.040 --> 02:27:55.470
of the comments pertaining
to the Donald.

02:27:55.470 --> 02:27:58.940 position:56%
And two, three days later, I checked
all the folks who were not even

02:27:58.940 --> 02:28:02.290
on my list that we just
communicate, those folks who were

02:28:02.290 --> 02:28:07.490
so vehemently opposed to Trump
had already deleted everything

02:28:07.490 --> 02:28:10.530
on their web pages on Donald.

02:28:10.530 --> 02:28:16.510
But more particularly, the African
Muslims that I communicated with,

02:28:16.510 --> 02:28:18.190
some of them are not
even communicating

02:28:18.190 --> 02:28:20.770
with me anymore about the Donald.

02:28:20.770 --> 02:28:24.710
Why? Because I think I was the
only African, if I can remember,

02:28:24.710 --> 02:28:26.430
or the Muslim that predicted

02:28:26.430 --> 02:28:29.240
that the Donald was going
to win this election.

02:28:29.240 --> 02:28:36.200
I went in to write 11 factors
of why Sister Hillary will lose.

02:28:36.200 --> 02:28:40.330
And I am, by the way,
a card carrying member

02:28:40.330 --> 02:28:45.600
of the National Democratic Council.

02:28:45.600 --> 02:28:50.990
So, for me, it was very difficult
to accept Sister Hillary's loss

02:28:50.990 --> 02:28:53.810
because I'm the one that
coined the name Sister Hillary

02:28:53.810 --> 02:28:55.620
that became popular when she ran

02:28:55.620 --> 02:29:00.130
against Barack Obama
two elections ago.

02:29:00.130 --> 02:29:04.420
But we African Muslims, as
I've been talking to them,

02:29:04.420 --> 02:29:10.560
have to engage the Donald
just like we did George Bush.

02:29:10.560 --> 02:29:14.600
George Bush came and said Africa
was not in his radar screen.

02:29:14.600 --> 02:29:18.180
When the terrorist attack happened,
he has a war against Islam.

02:29:18.180 --> 02:29:23.770
But we are able to communicate
and educate and exchange ideas.

02:29:23.770 --> 02:29:26.550
It changes views.

02:29:26.550 --> 02:29:28.550
And what happened?

02:29:28.550 --> 02:29:33.180
George Bush turned out to be the
best president towards Africa

02:29:33.180 --> 02:29:38.050
than any other president
before him, and definitely more

02:29:38.050 --> 02:29:39.820
so than the one after him.

02:29:39.820 --> 02:29:42.510
I thank you and I'll shut up.

02:29:42.510 --> 02:29:46.500
[ Applause ]

02:29:49.650 --> 02:29:52.050
&gt;&gt; Toyin Falola: Thank
you very much.

02:29:52.050 --> 02:30:02.590
We now have to manage in
20 minutes for all the--

02:30:02.590 --> 02:30:08.870
&gt;&gt; Abdul Karim Bangura: I
gave you a little bit of time.

02:30:08.870 --> 02:30:10.170
&gt;&gt; Toyin Falola: Where is John?

02:30:10.170 --> 02:30:12.250
You want to do this
or you should what--

02:30:12.250 --> 02:30:14.480
[ Inaudible Remark ]

02:30:14.480 --> 02:30:22.110
Yeah. There have been so
many issues on the table

02:30:22.110 --> 02:30:25.380
and the last one on
specific identity.

02:30:25.380 --> 02:30:31.590
And by the time, we're throwing
the nation of Islam into it,

02:30:31.590 --> 02:30:36.860
you find more-- Mary, please,
you want to-- Please go ahead.

02:30:41.410 --> 02:30:47.770
&gt;&gt; Mary: Happen to have lunch with
a group from Fulbright organization

02:30:47.770 --> 02:30:50.670
and one of the women
who had come here

02:30:50.670 --> 02:30:57.340
from Latin America originally came
on a Fulbright and over a period

02:30:57.340 --> 02:31:02.050
of time, she became a resident,
US resident and citizen.

02:31:02.050 --> 02:31:07.520
And she mentioned that when
Fulbright brought people

02:31:07.520 --> 02:31:12.110
from another country, they
took great care to orient them

02:31:12.110 --> 02:31:16.690 position:56%
to a new culture, and then they took
great care to orient the community

02:31:16.690 --> 02:31:24.180
that they were going into to the
immigrant, to the person coming in.

02:31:24.180 --> 02:31:29.530
And I am wanting to ask you,
folks, whether you've experienced

02:31:29.530 --> 02:31:32.610
that happening for
African immigrants

02:31:32.610 --> 02:31:36.790
and would it be a good
idea if it isn't happening

02:31:36.790 --> 02:31:41.610
and where could it
possibly begin to happen?

02:31:41.610 --> 02:31:44.440
&gt;&gt; Toyin Falola: What-- Let
me start to answer that.

02:31:44.440 --> 02:31:48.480
My introduction to the
US was made possible

02:31:48.480 --> 02:31:52.600
by what we call Crossroads
Africa Operation.

02:31:52.600 --> 02:31:55.240
It was a New York agency.

02:31:55.240 --> 02:32:02.360 position:56%
It was a sort of NGO, it was an NGO.

02:32:02.360 --> 02:32:07.290
And in 19-- I was finishing
my PhD back then, 1980,

02:32:07.290 --> 02:32:12.320
and they invited me to--
like 12 of us to come

02:32:12.320 --> 02:32:17.320
and they took us to so many states.

02:32:17.320 --> 02:32:21.810
So, I had that kind of
formal introduction.

02:32:21.810 --> 02:32:25.530
Well, for most people,
I don't-- I'm not sure.

02:32:25.530 --> 02:32:30.240
Bear in mind that the majority
of people come in terms of--

02:32:30.240 --> 02:32:37.590
they don't come as professionals
like those first folks for me.

02:32:37.590 --> 02:32:41.710 position:56%
For those who come as professionals,
they have done their PhDs here,

02:32:41.710 --> 02:32:44.070
the school system has
already done that.

02:32:44.070 --> 02:32:48.190
I don't know what.

02:32:48.190 --> 02:32:51.920 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Nemata Blyden: I could-- I just--
I'm not answering her question

02:32:51.920 --> 02:32:53.680
but I just want to say in light

02:32:53.680 --> 02:32:58.050 position:56%
of I think my talk was Crossroads
is an African-American organization,

02:32:58.050 --> 02:32:59.350
is it not?

02:32:59.350 --> 02:33:01.780
&gt;&gt; Toyin Falola: I think so.

02:33:01.780 --> 02:33:03.830
&gt;&gt; Kenneth Harrow: Yeah.

02:33:03.830 --> 02:33:05.130
&gt;&gt; Toyin Falola: OK.

02:33:05.130 --> 02:33:06.430
&gt;&gt; Kenneth Harrow: In
response to that and thinking

02:33:06.430 --> 02:33:09.210
of Moses' presentation,
it's kind of ironic.

02:33:09.210 --> 02:33:11.530
We have a-- I'll speak only
from Lansing but I bet--

02:33:11.530 --> 02:33:14.180
Lansing, Michigan, but I think
it's typical around the country.

02:33:14.180 --> 02:33:17.550
We have a refugee center and
when refugees are brought in,

02:33:17.550 --> 02:33:21.000
there's a good deal of attempt
to assist in the integration

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:25.370
into the culture and whatever,
life, jobs and so forth.

02:33:25.370 --> 02:33:29.900
But when students come to the
university, we have very little

02:33:29.900 --> 02:33:32.890
of that, unless they don't
speak English, then they have

02:33:32.890 --> 02:33:37.190
to pass an exam in English before
they can go on and take courses.

02:33:37.190 --> 02:33:40.590
In other words, those who were the
best educated get the least amount

02:33:40.590 --> 02:33:44.790
of what you're describing
and- whereas those who come

02:33:44.790 --> 02:33:48.410
in the most conditions
of duress get the most.

02:33:48.410 --> 02:33:49.710
It's kind of ironic.

02:33:49.710 --> 02:33:51.010
There's kind of inversion.

02:33:51.010 --> 02:33:52.310
&gt;&gt; Abdul Karim Bangura:
In this area,

02:33:52.310 --> 02:33:54.010 position:56%
the best is the Ethiopian community.

02:33:54.010 --> 02:33:59.160
Not only do they have a TV
station now, a radio station,

02:33:59.160 --> 02:34:03.580
but they do even organize
an annual conference.

02:34:03.580 --> 02:34:07.940
And they have a center in
Arlington whenever Ethiopians come

02:34:07.940 --> 02:34:12.220
and they meet them at the
airport and then immerse them

02:34:12.220 --> 02:34:14.530
into the society on what happens.

02:34:14.530 --> 02:34:18.210
And they give them also the
support network, the transition

02:34:18.210 --> 02:34:21.710
from being immigrants
into the society.

02:34:21.710 --> 02:34:27.190
So I have to give the Ethiopians
kudos for that great initiative.

02:34:28.280 --> 02:34:31.010
&gt;&gt; Toyin Falola: Questions
or comments?

02:34:31.010 --> 02:34:32.840
Yes, please.

02:34:32.840 --> 02:34:36.980
&gt;&gt; So, thank you very much
for the presentations.

02:34:36.980 --> 02:34:40.150
And I have a question that
occurred to me, Moses,

02:34:40.150 --> 02:34:42.500
during your presentation, but
I think it could be a question

02:34:42.500 --> 02:34:46.730
for the panel particularly
Nemata and Kenneth as well,

02:34:46.730 --> 02:34:49.930
which was thinking
about your discussions

02:34:49.930 --> 02:34:54.180
of US populations of
African immigrants.

02:34:54.180 --> 02:34:58.890
And the particularities
of the sort of US history

02:34:58.890 --> 02:35:02.480 position:56%
in which these immigrant communities
find themselves implicated

02:35:02.480 --> 02:35:08.000
for a variety of reasons and
how that may or may not differ

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:11.280
if anybody can speak to this
from immigrant populations

02:35:11.280 --> 02:35:15.480
that are moving to places of
former direct colonization.

02:35:15.480 --> 02:35:18.050
And I was thinking particularly,
Moses, of your discussion

02:35:18.050 --> 02:35:20.910
of the sort of US idealism
and humanitarian sort

02:35:20.910 --> 02:35:25.660
of white savior complex
and the, perhaps,

02:35:25.660 --> 02:35:28.270
historically inaccurate
sense in the US

02:35:28.270 --> 02:35:30.630
of the US is not a
direct colonial power.

02:35:30.630 --> 02:35:33.690
And so, Kenneth, I was thinking
of this in your juxtaposition

02:35:33.690 --> 02:35:36.500
of a number of these authors who
are writing from different kinds

02:35:36.500 --> 02:35:42.480
of spaces of immigration from
the US or from places in Europe

02:35:42.480 --> 02:35:45.630
of former direct colonization.

02:35:45.630 --> 02:35:46.930
&gt;&gt; Toyin Falola: Moses.

02:35:46.930 --> 02:35:48.950
&gt;&gt; Moses Ochonu: Yeah, I'm going
to-- I think there is a certain--

02:35:48.950 --> 02:35:56.110
there's a certain ideal that
operates within the US sense

02:35:56.110 --> 02:35:59.090
of itself, the way that
Americans perceive themselves,

02:35:59.090 --> 02:36:02.120
and it goes back to the
history of how Americans--

02:36:02.120 --> 02:36:04.750
when it's obviously it's
debatable because at some point,

02:36:04.750 --> 02:36:07.600
the US did have colonies, whether
you want to call them colonies

02:36:07.600 --> 02:36:09.560 position:56%
or not, that's a different question.

02:36:09.560 --> 02:36:13.070
But it goes to the sense of the--
that Americans have of themselves

02:36:13.070 --> 02:36:18.300
as people who have natural
solidarity for sovereign people,

02:36:18.300 --> 02:36:21.740
for marginalized people, for
displaced people, and for people

02:36:21.740 --> 02:36:24.220
who have been colonized and
brutalized and so on and so forth

02:36:24.220 --> 02:36:28.630
because we too went through those
things and we came out of it ahead.

02:36:28.630 --> 02:36:31.660
And so, therefore, it
is our responsibility,

02:36:31.660 --> 02:36:34.260
almost a moral responsibility
to help others.

02:36:34.260 --> 02:36:36.160
So, it's a moral discourse, right?

02:36:36.160 --> 02:36:38.190
It's a moral discourse.

02:36:38.190 --> 02:36:41.400
Of course that then
becomes almost like a--

02:36:41.400 --> 02:36:44.840
It's almost like a blind spot
that develops out of that.

02:36:44.840 --> 02:36:49.580
Becomes a blind spot that prevents
Americans, as I argued in my paper,

02:36:49.580 --> 02:36:52.240
from seeing the ways
in which, you know,

02:36:52.240 --> 02:36:56.760
they've basically constructed
an image of Africa as a place

02:36:56.760 --> 02:36:59.230
that produces refugees, right?

02:36:59.230 --> 02:37:02.290
And as America, as a
counterpart image of America,

02:37:02.290 --> 02:37:03.780
as a place that receives
and nurtures

02:37:03.780 --> 02:37:06.610
and rehabilitates these
refugees, right?

02:37:06.610 --> 02:37:11.860 position:56%
So, I think that sense of self, it's
a very-- it's a moral discourse.

02:37:11.860 --> 02:37:13.160
And most societies have that.

02:37:13.160 --> 02:37:14.460
There's nothing wrong with that.

02:37:14.460 --> 02:37:15.760
I mean, that's the
root of nationalism

02:37:15.760 --> 02:37:17.060
and patriotism and all of that.

02:37:17.060 --> 02:37:20.400
Well, that then becomes this
discourse that, you know,

02:37:20.400 --> 02:37:22.960
is then projected even on
through the immigrants themselves

02:37:22.960 --> 02:37:24.400
and constrains the way

02:37:24.400 --> 02:37:27.420
that immigrants themselves
tell their stories, right,

02:37:27.420 --> 02:37:30.760
because they assume that, you
know, stories, these stories have

02:37:30.760 --> 02:37:35.180
to fit a certain image of the
African immigrant, being a refugee,

02:37:35.180 --> 02:37:39.060
looking for a economical
opportunities and it leads

02:37:39.060 --> 02:37:44.750 position:56%
to what examples that I give of
outright fabrication, embellishment,

02:37:44.750 --> 02:37:49.940
of making up stories, of you know,
talking about impossible events

02:37:49.940 --> 02:37:52.180
that are simply not true.

02:37:52.180 --> 02:37:55.140
Because the more melodramatic,
the better,

02:37:55.140 --> 02:37:57.760
the more positive the
reception, right?

02:37:57.760 --> 02:37:59.390
So it works both ways.

02:37:59.390 --> 02:38:01.580
It works under their hand
to reinforce this image

02:38:01.580 --> 02:38:07.430
of America's humanitarian side,
side of humanitarian intervention.

02:38:07.430 --> 02:38:11.330
But it also then becomes at least
for the purpose of this panel,

02:38:11.330 --> 02:38:15.430
becomes a way to close
off an examination

02:38:15.430 --> 02:38:18.020
of alternative migrant itineraries

02:38:18.020 --> 02:38:21.400
that do not fit into
that template, so.

02:38:21.400 --> 02:38:24.940
&gt;&gt; Toyin Falola: And there
are two complications.

02:38:24.940 --> 02:38:29.840
The first is the unreliable
nature of the data

02:38:29.840 --> 02:38:35.350
of immigrants fed into Africa.

02:38:35.350 --> 02:38:42.160
It's-- I have read many of
them and they're so unreliable

02:38:42.160 --> 02:38:46.520
because they deal with
exaggerations.

02:38:46.520 --> 02:38:51.400 position:56%
It is very difficult for individuals
to say that they are not successful.

02:38:51.400 --> 02:38:57.120
It's easier for them
to do the opposite.

02:38:57.120 --> 02:39:02.960
Even photography, you find someone
taking a photograph in front

02:39:02.960 --> 02:39:06.150
of a car that doesn't belong to him

02:39:06.150 --> 02:39:10.040
and sending the photograph
back to Africa.

02:39:10.040 --> 02:39:14.910
So the slogan is, you either
make it or you fake it.

02:39:14.910 --> 02:39:20.140
As for me, doing this
project, intensely data-driven,

02:39:20.140 --> 02:39:22.890
the complications are so many.

02:39:22.890 --> 02:39:30.580
The other myth which we have to
explore is that it is not true

02:39:30.580 --> 02:39:40.530
as you'll find in literature that
movement to the west is far more--

02:39:41.910 --> 02:39:47.420
Actually, internal movements
within Africa is far more intense.

02:39:48.620 --> 02:39:56.860
So, when Boutros-Ghali left the
United Nations for the first time

02:39:56.860 --> 02:40:02.630
and was looking for a new thing to
do, he was able to persuade Mubarak

02:40:02.630 --> 02:40:06.040
to set up the Arab Summit.

02:40:06.040 --> 02:40:10.460
And Mrs. Mubarak adopted it.

02:40:10.460 --> 02:40:18.130
And that became, in one
word, drafted into it.

02:40:18.130 --> 02:40:23.940
And that zone, Egypt,
Palestinian, Libya, that zone,

02:40:23.940 --> 02:40:27.250
2 million people migrate
every year, 2 million.

02:40:27.250 --> 02:40:31.970
So, not only do we have to
understand this damnation of Africa

02:40:31.970 --> 02:40:38.890
in the west, I think we may
also have to begin to lock it

02:40:38.890 --> 02:40:43.460 position:56%
within Africa itself, especially
the extensive nature of the movement

02:40:43.460 --> 02:40:45.500
between Nigeria and Gambia.

02:40:45.500 --> 02:40:47.720
It's so extensive.

02:40:47.720 --> 02:40:52.390
But what we tend to focus is
the Nigerians going to New York,

02:40:52.390 --> 02:40:53.930
the Kenyans going to London.

02:40:53.930 --> 02:40:58.000
Now, we begin-- We have to
begin to rethink some of this.

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:02.710
You what, I saw you yesterday,
at Georgetown University, right?

02:41:02.710 --> 02:41:04.930
Yeah.

02:41:04.930 --> 02:41:06.360
&gt;&gt; Can you-- Is this on?

02:41:06.360 --> 02:41:09.120
Oh, yeah. My question is--

02:41:17.530 --> 02:41:27.620
Africans coming to America and
the refugee status, the poverty,

02:41:27.620 --> 02:41:30.470
that's right, the poverty status.

02:41:30.470 --> 02:41:34.840
My question is the Africans who--

02:41:34.840 --> 02:41:38.630
the professionals who
have found their homes

02:41:38.630 --> 02:41:46.640
in America left their countries
but they left their ties

02:41:46.640 --> 02:41:49.840
with the people back home.

02:41:49.840 --> 02:41:55.560
In that, in America, the sense
is that you're an individual

02:41:55.560 --> 02:42:02.430
and that you may--
you're a self-made person

02:42:02.430 --> 02:42:07.280
and that you've pulled yourself
up from your own bootstraps.

02:42:07.280 --> 02:42:14.300 position:56%
Wherein Africa, you're a member of a
family and that family is extensive.

02:42:14.300 --> 02:42:22.780
You have cousins and uncles
and grandparents but now, you--

02:42:22.780 --> 02:42:28.970
from the presentation that I've
heard, now, you've set this notion

02:42:28.970 --> 02:42:34.370
that you don't have
to have a family.

02:42:34.370 --> 02:42:43.250
You don't have to have
extensive village or tribe, even.

02:42:43.250 --> 02:42:46.730
You can come to America
and separate yourself

02:42:46.730 --> 02:42:50.250
from what you had back home.

02:42:50.250 --> 02:42:56.270
Is that a good thing?

02:42:56.270 --> 02:42:57.570
&gt;&gt; Toyin Falola: OK.

02:42:57.570 --> 02:42:59.230
Well, that is not what
our data is telling us.

02:42:59.230 --> 02:43:02.730
The data is telling us the
opposite of what you said.

02:43:02.730 --> 02:43:08.810
Yeah, because I-- when I was
introducing this subject,

02:43:08.810 --> 02:43:11.430
I told you about the data
I'm collected in three states

02:43:11.430 --> 02:43:16.270
around here, Pentecostalism
associations.

02:43:16.270 --> 02:43:18.100
They're very strong.

02:43:18.100 --> 02:43:24.830
So, take the Redeemer's
Church of Christ by Adeboye.

02:43:24.830 --> 02:43:29.480
There is no American city where
that church doesn't exist.

02:43:29.480 --> 02:43:32.880
Moses attends the one in Nashville.

02:43:32.880 --> 02:43:35.220
I've been to his church.

02:43:35.220 --> 02:43:41.340
So that-- So, he, if somebody--
let me give you one example.

02:43:41.340 --> 02:43:43.620
If somebody calls me
Toyin, that's my name.

02:43:43.620 --> 02:43:44.920
&gt;&gt; Bad example.

02:43:44.920 --> 02:43:46.300
&gt;&gt; Toyin Falola: I definitely
know this is a stranger

02:43:46.300 --> 02:43:48.440
because nobody calls me Toyin.

02:43:48.440 --> 02:43:51.060
Nobody calls me that name.

02:43:51.060 --> 02:43:53.530
So in Austin, they call me Baba.

02:43:53.530 --> 02:43:55.190
That's what they call me.

02:43:55.190 --> 02:43:58.670
Well that Baba, which is a father
and they're not my children

02:43:58.670 --> 02:44:03.270
and I'm the patron of say
the Yoruba Association.

02:44:03.270 --> 02:44:05.360
I'm a patron of so
many of this event.

02:44:05.360 --> 02:44:09.380
They've recreated them,
the sociological time

02:44:09.380 --> 02:44:11.080
of affection and kinship.

02:44:11.080 --> 02:44:13.660
Many of these things
have been recreated.

02:44:13.660 --> 02:44:17.860
So, what people have done is

02:44:17.860 --> 02:44:22.440
to rework this community
back, only redefining them.

02:44:22.440 --> 02:44:25.320
Since I came, we have
attended meetings

02:44:25.320 --> 02:44:28.020
in Baltimore, firewood places.

02:44:28.020 --> 02:44:30.870 position:56%
So these things have been recreated.

02:44:30.870 --> 02:44:32.170
Yes.

02:44:32.170 --> 02:44:33.470 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Nemata Blyden: I was going to add

02:44:33.470 --> 02:44:34.770
that I think it's an
individual choice.

02:44:34.770 --> 02:44:37.070
My students just finished their
final project where they had

02:44:37.070 --> 02:44:39.930
to interview an African immigrant.

02:44:39.930 --> 02:44:44.430
And I heard a whole host of ways
in which the various immigrants

02:44:44.430 --> 02:44:47.490
that they interviewed are
adapting to and choosing

02:44:47.490 --> 02:44:49.540
to live in the United States.

02:44:49.540 --> 02:44:52.840 position:56%
From the young man who's decided
he's done with his country in Africa

02:44:52.840 --> 02:44:56.940
and doesn't have any
extended family to a woman

02:44:56.940 --> 02:45:02.730
who has a significant network and
has essentially recreated her life

02:45:02.730 --> 02:45:05.600
in the United States as it would
have been in her home country.

02:45:05.600 --> 02:45:08.630
So I don't think we can
generalize in that way.

02:45:08.630 --> 02:45:09.930
&gt;&gt; Moses Ochonu: Also-- OK.

02:45:09.930 --> 02:45:14.260
I wanted to add briefly that we
also have to understand that,

02:45:14.260 --> 02:45:15.750
even their decision to migrate,

02:45:15.750 --> 02:45:18.400
whether their decision is
voluntary or involuntary.

02:45:18.400 --> 02:45:19.700
&gt;&gt; Nemata Blyden: Makes
a difference.

02:45:19.700 --> 02:45:22.100
&gt;&gt; Moses Ochonu: There's a lot of
people invested in their decision,

02:45:22.100 --> 02:45:25.410
beyond the individual
back in Africa, right?

02:45:25.410 --> 02:45:29.140
So that the choices that the
immigrant makes when he or she gets

02:45:29.140 --> 02:45:32.090 position:56%
to America, those choices themselves
are constrained and shaped

02:45:32.090 --> 02:45:36.650 position:56%
to a large extent by the
expectational economy back in Africa

02:45:36.650 --> 02:45:38.620
in terms of what they
choose to study in school,

02:45:38.620 --> 02:45:40.190
what kind of professional
they're going to,

02:45:40.190 --> 02:45:41.740
these things are connected.

02:45:41.740 --> 02:45:44.330
So there's no separation,
I would say.

02:45:44.330 --> 02:45:45.630
&gt;&gt; Toyin Falola: Yes, please.

02:45:45.630 --> 02:45:49.930
Ah, but later ask a question.

02:45:49.930 --> 02:45:51.470
Last two people here.

02:45:51.470 --> 02:45:53.310
Please, let's take
them-- who wants to.

02:45:53.310 --> 02:45:56.180
Let's take-- who wants to--

02:45:56.180 --> 02:46:03.340
&gt;&gt; I am very intrigued
about the forced migration

02:46:03.340 --> 02:46:10.870
of Muslim Africans here
in the United States.

02:46:10.870 --> 02:46:20.480
And when you started your lecture
about the Muslims, I've read a book

02:46:20.480 --> 02:46:29.020 position:56%
by Sylviane Diouf who talks about
the Muslims that were very important

02:46:29.020 --> 02:46:38.290
to the slavery work
that had to be done to--

02:46:38.290 --> 02:46:41.320
for the Africans here, let's say.

02:46:41.320 --> 02:46:46.840
And I wondered-- And also,
you talked about Amistad,

02:46:46.840 --> 02:46:50.050
I've never you-- No, I'm
hearing more and more

02:46:50.050 --> 02:46:56.200 position:56%
about that particular Muslim
collection-- information about that.

02:46:56.200 --> 02:47:04.010 position:56%
And I just wondered how that affects
all the Muslims who are coming

02:47:04.010 --> 02:47:13.630
from the continent here, from west,
south whatever, because this--

02:47:13.630 --> 02:47:24.310
the Muslims were a great force
to destroy as the type of slavery

02:47:24.310 --> 02:47:28.120
that was held, hear and
in sight for long time.

02:47:28.120 --> 02:47:35.120
And no one-- well, some people do
know that, but I just want to--

02:47:35.120 --> 02:47:40.380
how does it follow through with
current immigration in terms

02:47:40.380 --> 02:47:42.810
of the Muslim collection.

02:47:42.810 --> 02:47:44.110
&gt;&gt; Abdul Karim Bangura:
Unfortunately--

02:47:44.110 --> 02:47:45.410
&gt;&gt; Toyin Falola: Abdul,
please hold them.

02:47:45.410 --> 02:47:46.710
They'll begin to asks.

02:47:46.710 --> 02:47:48.010
&gt;&gt; Abdul Karim Bangura: OK--

02:47:48.010 --> 02:47:49.510
&gt;&gt; Toyin Falola: So that
we're not disrespectful.

02:47:49.510 --> 02:47:52.900
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

02:47:52.900 --> 02:47:55.920
Actually, what I want to touch
on is and I'll be very brief.

02:47:55.920 --> 02:48:01.770
I actually wanted to dwell a
little on more on what Professor--

02:48:01.770 --> 02:48:07.950
Dr. Ochonu remarked but it
probably wouldn't be the time

02:48:07.950 --> 02:48:09.470
to dwell on that at this time.

02:48:09.470 --> 02:48:13.230
So, in the interest of time, I
will touch on what he said there

02:48:13.230 --> 02:48:21.720
and then maybe a subsequent venue,
we could get into what he deals

02:48:21.720 --> 02:48:26.330
with because I really
wonder if we have the--

02:48:26.330 --> 02:48:30.430
I'll just abbreviate it by
saying that Africans who are here

02:48:30.430 --> 02:48:33.170
in America, they've
done stellar things.

02:48:33.170 --> 02:48:37.120
You look at the instance
of Lupita Nyong'o.

02:48:37.120 --> 02:48:42.180
I think she's probably the last
Black Academy Award winner to date.

02:48:42.180 --> 02:48:47.330
There is also, you
look at Victor Oladipo.

02:48:47.330 --> 02:48:49.470 position:56%
He just won an $84 million contract.

02:48:49.470 --> 02:48:54.270
He is one of the-- these are
all Africans who are here,

02:48:54.270 --> 02:48:57.280
they are born of African parents
so if they wanted to be identified

02:48:57.280 --> 02:48:59.810
as Americans but at least
they're all born of Africans.

02:48:59.810 --> 02:49:01.760
And they're continental Africans.

02:49:01.760 --> 02:49:03.060
And he is a rookie.

02:49:03.060 --> 02:49:05.990
He's getting approximately
$21 million a year.

02:49:05.990 --> 02:49:10.500
The person who just designed this
new museum of African-American--

02:49:10.500 --> 02:49:11.800
&gt;&gt; Toyin Falola: Adjaye.

02:49:11.800 --> 02:49:13.100
&gt;&gt; -- history and culture--

02:49:13.100 --> 02:49:14.400
&gt;&gt; Nemata Blyden: Adjaye.

02:49:14.400 --> 02:49:18.080
&gt;&gt; -- David Adjaye, you know, I
think British-African architect.

02:49:18.080 --> 02:49:21.430
Obama, you know, I can go on.

02:49:21.430 --> 02:49:23.540
So, the stellar things
have been done.

02:49:23.540 --> 02:49:30.870
So, my point, I just want to
raise is that Dr. Ochonu does talk

02:49:30.870 --> 02:49:36.340
about the fact that we're
coming here and for this--

02:49:36.340 --> 02:49:39.680
his thesis of psychosocial
strategic migrants.

02:49:39.680 --> 02:49:42.100
I would like to get him
to that at some point

02:49:42.100 --> 02:49:45.460
but the point is we are coming here
in droves and we're doing well.

02:49:45.460 --> 02:49:46.760
So let's try to admit that.

02:49:46.760 --> 02:49:51.200
There are still lots to deal
with back in-- on the continent.

02:49:51.200 --> 02:49:56.390
So probably maybe it's time for
us to look at probably trying

02:49:56.390 --> 02:49:58.340
to see the best of both worlds.

02:49:58.340 --> 02:50:01.200
You know, like for
instance, Americans, those--

02:50:01.200 --> 02:50:05.210
the [inaudible] for instance like
to live in New York when it's warm

02:50:05.210 --> 02:50:07.400
and they like to live in
Florida when it's hot.

02:50:07.400 --> 02:50:12.900
So probably, we Africans too
probably could consider, you know,

02:50:12.900 --> 02:50:16.500
coming here for technology and
so on and then when it's all cold

02:50:16.500 --> 02:50:18.010
like now, we're back in Africa.

02:50:18.010 --> 02:50:19.410
That's just this.

02:50:19.410 --> 02:50:21.130
&gt;&gt; Moses Ochonu: That was good.

02:50:21.130 --> 02:50:22.430
&gt;&gt; Toyin Falola: I'm sorry.

02:50:22.430 --> 02:50:26.230
We won't be able to
answer the questions.

02:50:26.230 --> 02:50:31.800
I should have timed the Kluge
Center when I started but I was

02:50:31.800 --> 02:50:34.190
in total panic about time.

02:50:34.190 --> 02:50:36.590
So, I now want to close--

02:50:36.590 --> 02:50:39.380
&gt;&gt; Moses Ochonu: Prof.
just one sentence.

02:50:39.380 --> 02:50:40.680
&gt;&gt; Toyin Falola: Please, go ahead.

02:50:40.680 --> 02:50:41.980
&gt;&gt; Moses Ochonu: OK.

02:50:41.980 --> 02:50:45.130
My wonderful sister
raised a very question,

02:50:45.130 --> 02:50:48.460
unfortunately, time did not permit.

02:50:48.460 --> 02:50:53.780 position:56%
Prof. Omoyeni Falola's colleague,
Denise Spellberg, wrote a great book

02:50:53.780 --> 02:50:56.090
"Thomas Jefferson's Qur'an",

02:50:56.090 --> 02:50:59.990
how the Koran shaped the United
States Constitution and the debates

02:50:59.990 --> 02:51:02.700
that went around the Constitution.

02:51:02.700 --> 02:51:05.900
What she was able to document
was Jefferson was learning

02:51:05.900 --> 02:51:11.530 position:56%
from the enslaved Africans under him
saw them worshipping facing the east

02:51:11.530 --> 02:51:13.280
and asked them, why
you facing the east?

02:51:13.280 --> 02:51:18.430 position:56%
They said, that's because that's our
mecca, the Kaaba and Africa unite.

02:51:18.430 --> 02:51:21.010
So there are so many things
Jefferson was able to learn

02:51:21.010 --> 02:51:24.530
from the enslaved people under
him that shaped his own thinking.

02:51:24.530 --> 02:51:27.520 position:56%
It's not just the Koran that we
have here in the Library of Congress

02:51:27.520 --> 02:51:30.000
that is displayed,
that we know about.

02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:31.300
But she has done a great job.

02:51:31.300 --> 02:51:33.590
Anybody who wants to know
more, please, get that book.

02:51:33.590 --> 02:51:37.130
I'm not promoting it, but you
know, I think it's a good source.

02:51:37.130 --> 02:51:38.960
&gt;&gt; Toyin Falola: That's
my colleague.

02:51:38.960 --> 02:51:42.410
So let me thank Jason
Dan [assumed spelling],

02:51:42.410 --> 02:51:44.880
the Director of the Kluge Center.

02:51:44.880 --> 02:51:50.910
Dan was worried about the audience
and when I got here, I was so happy

02:51:50.910 --> 02:51:52.680
because the audience is similar

02:51:52.680 --> 02:51:56.610
to what's they've had
with other programs.

02:51:56.610 --> 02:52:00.450
And hopefully, this
conversation will continue,

02:52:00.450 --> 02:52:04.370
great books be written, a new
sub-field will be created.

02:52:04.370 --> 02:52:09.020
And we are very grateful
that you are part

02:52:09.020 --> 02:52:10.420
of the history in the making.

02:52:10.420 --> 02:52:12.510
Thank you very much.

02:52:12.510 --> 02:52:15.510
[ Applause ]

02:52:15.510 --> 02:52:19.200
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
