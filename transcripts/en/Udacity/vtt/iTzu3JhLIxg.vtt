00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.840
&gt;&gt; That's a smart answer David.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.860
Recall that originally I had said that I'll explain structural similarity, and

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.330
I have not done it so far. I'm going to use the spherical example and

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.110
David's answer to explain it now. Given the solar system as the source case, and

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.810
the atomic structure as target problem. We can see that there is little semantic

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.370
similarity between them. The kinds of objects that occur in the solar system

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.690
are not at all like the kinds of objects that occur in the atomic structure.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.400
We can also see that pragmatic similarity is not a major issue here. We're not

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.370
talking about the goal of the solar system or the goal of the atomic structure.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.170
Although we might have the goal of understanding atomic structure in the solar

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.370
system, there is nothing in the solar system, or in the atomic structure,

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.310
which has a goal. Yet, David was able to answer this question correctly.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.440
This is because of structural similarity. Let us consider the top part of

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.070
the model of the solar system. You can think of this top part like a graph.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.170
The vertices in this graph, correspond to objects and their properties.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.912
The edges in this graph correspond to relationships, such as force between Sun

00:02:11.912 --> 00:02:16.910
and Planet. Or, Sun attracts Planet, and Planet attracts Sun. Once again,

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.060
this graphical representation of the model atomic structure.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.390
The words are representing the objects and the features. And the edges

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.080
are representing the relationships between the objects. Although there's little

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.880
semantic similarity, or pragmatic similarity between the two situations,

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.760
we can see a structural similarity. A similarity in the structure of the graphs.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.960
Because this part of the graph of the representative of the solar system.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.250
The similar this part of the graph of the representative of the atomic

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.780
structure. We can differ infer that we can transfer this part of the graph

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.040
of the solar system to infer this part of the graph of the atomic structure.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.860
Structural similarity then captures relational similarity.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.570
What is common between these two situations is neither the objects or

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.740
the goals. Where as common here as the relational similarity, and

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.480
that is what structure similarity captures.
