00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.750
- [Voiceover] We are asked to
draw the line of reflection

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.070
that will map quadrilateral SORT,

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.950
S-O-R-T

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.760
onto the other quadrilateral below.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.490
So this is the other
quadrilateral right over here.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.190
So we wanna reflect SORT

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.130
so it maps onto this other quadrilateral,

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.580
and we wanna draw or define

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.200
the line of reflection using
this tool right over here.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.720
And so see if I just kind of eyeball it,

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.480
it looks like, it looks like something,

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.030
something like, that is
starting to get close

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.310
but not quite.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.860
And the way I could tackle this,

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.730
I could look at corresponding points.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.500
I could say look, point S right over here

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.030
in the image after the reflection

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.360
the corresponding point
is that right over there.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.087
And so the line of reflection
should contain a point

00:00:53.087 --> 00:00:56.810
that is half way between these two points.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.000
And so what's a point
that's halfway between them?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.760
Well, let's see, where I have
it right now isn't halfway.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.000
If I put it there, that
actually looks halfway

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.750
between this point and the
corresponding point in the image.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.960
Notice, to get from here to there,

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.220
I took one to the left,

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.530
I had to take one step to
the left, three steps up

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.730
to go from here to here,

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.460
I take one step to the
left, three steps up.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.730
So these are definitely the same distance

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.830
away from this point and this point,

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.760
are both the same distance
away from this line

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.776
or this point that's on this line.

00:01:30.776 --> 00:01:32.930
So now let's see where
this point could go,

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.490
and I could do something similar.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.610
I could try to find,

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.750
let's see, I need to
find a different point.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.390
Let's see, maybe a point that's halfway

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.978
between this point and T

00:01:44.978 --> 00:01:46.450
and the corresponding point of the image

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.060
which is that over there.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.460
And let's see, I can probably put it,

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.550
that actually looks pretty good

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.590
because this is one step to the left,

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.184
three steps up, and then
to get from here to there,

00:01:59.184 --> 00:02:01.580
one step to the left and three steps up.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.090
So this looks pretty good.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.620
This looks like I have drawn

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.090
the line of reflection.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.100
This point that I'm
highlighting right now in orange

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.060
is halfway between T and
the corresponding point

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.200
to the image.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.760
This point right over here is halfway

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.560
between S and the corresponding
point of the image.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.820
You need to just to have two points

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.550
to define our line, this looks like

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.230
my line of reflection.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.590
Let's see whether I'd got it right.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.750
And I did.
