00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.350
&gt;&gt; So now we're going to look at a persona that

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.130
we can use for our pizza app, and we're going

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.800
to call her Dorm Room Debbie. So this is going

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.660
to be an, a good example so you can learn how

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.030
to use personas in the apps that you design in

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.480
the future. So let's look at Dorm Room Debbie's attributes. She's

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.350
a college student. She doesn't have a lot of money.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.120
She lives in a dorm. And Debbie doesn't have a car.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.750
&gt;&gt; This looks like a really good persona. Because it seems to be representative

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.480
of college students. Most of them don't have a lot of money, and probably

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.280
don't have cars, and live in dorms, so.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.550
&gt;&gt; Yep. Exactly. It looks like a very accurate

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.710
attribute for that type of user. And it's really important

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.770
to mention that you shouldn't denature attributes. And what

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.630
that means is try and put in an incompatible attribute,

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.780
within Debbie's list. So, if we put something in

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.933
there that really wouldn't make sense with the rest of

00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:48.250
them it makes the persona really imprecise and it doesn't

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.550
make a good product. Let's take a look at three

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.930
additional attributes and see which one doesn't fit with the rest.
