different learning is different so
 

00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:05.230
different learning is different so
teaching and learning must also be

00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:05.240
teaching and learning must also be
 

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:07.150
teaching and learning must also be
different but when it's all said and
