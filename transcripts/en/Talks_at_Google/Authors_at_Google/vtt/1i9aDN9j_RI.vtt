FEMALE SPEAKER: All
right, everyone.

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.916
Thank you so much for joining us
for this edition of our Authors

00:00:05.916 --> 00:00:08.145
at Google talk with Audrey Lee.

00:00:08.145 --> 00:00:09.520
We're excited to
have Audrey here

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.880
to discuss her new book,
which she co-authored

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.560
with Jane Hyun, "Flex",
the new playbook

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.770
for managing across differences.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.200
So who is Audrey?

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.420
Audrey S. Lee is an executive
coach and global leadership

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.620
and diversity strategist who
consults with Fortune 500

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.450
companies to develop
integrated leadership

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.970
strategies that impact
business practices

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.860
throughout organizations.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.640
She expertly combines program
facilitation, coaching,

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.520
and leadership
consulting practice

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.990
with more than 13
years of experience

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.700
in marketing communications,
product and program strategy,

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.850
alliance and channel marketing.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.380
So we decided to
bring Audrey here

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.590
to Google because of
her vast experience,

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.570
and also because
Google is committed

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.850
to bringing people together in
our workforce, our industry,

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.080
and on the web, who have a
broad range of attributes,

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.360
experiences and points of view.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.760
We believe our differences
make us stronger,

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.100
and produce better,
more innovative work.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.960
We recognize, though,
that we're not

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.480
where we want to be when it
comes to diversity, especially

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.060
in tech and leadership.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.590
And that's where
"Flex" comes in.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.410
The book expounds
on the vital skill

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.760
of flexing, the art of switching
between leadership styles

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.510
to more effectively
work with people

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.300
who are different than you.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.270
This critical skill
allows managers

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.710
to navigate successfully
the diverse business

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.840
environment of
today and tomorrow.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.435
So with no further ado, I'd
like to invite Audrey up

00:01:34.435 --> 00:01:35.470
to the stage.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.670
AUDREY S. LEE:
Thank you so much.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:38.847
Thank you so much.

00:01:38.847 --> 00:01:40.680
I'm really grateful to
have this opportunity

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.760
to come to Google
here in Mountain View.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.690
And I just wanted to say
that I started my career

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.010
and worked out here in
Silicon Valley for 12 years

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.140
before moving to New York City
and making that my current home

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.764
and starting my work in
leadership development.

00:01:55.764 --> 00:01:57.180
So I'm really
grateful to be back,

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.940
and I just-- I remember
Silicon Valley when

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.160
237 was a two-lane highway
and the biggest thing

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.000
here in Mountain View was
Shoreline Ampitheater.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.030
So it's changed a lot.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.420
I'm grateful to be here, and
I really thank the [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.540
for inviting me to talk a
little bit about Asian diversity

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.310
and leadership
development here at Google

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.330
and in this conversation.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.300
I just wanted to start
out by telling you

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.650
a little bit about myself.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.070
I am a first-generation
Asian-- American-born Chinese.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:35.360
My parents immigrated from China
here in the late '50s and '60s,

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.060
and I was born here in the
United States and raised here.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.690
So I have lots of stories
and a lot of experience that

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.080
crosses cultures, because
I grew up very bicultural.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.010
My father was very
Chinese, and my parents

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.720
had very strong Confucian values
which they instilled in us.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.260
There was no English
spoken at home.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
We ate only Chinese food.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.280
And one of my first bicultural
navigating experiences

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.580
happened when I was very young,
in elementary school, when

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.430
I went to school with my
lunch and a tupperware

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.890
with rice and some
soy sauce chicken.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.130
It's delicious, because
my mom was a great cook.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.420
But as I sat down for
lunch, I realized that when

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.130
my friends took out their brown
bags with their peanut butter

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.590
and jelly and their
bologna sandwiches

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.390
with Fritos, that
I basically had

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.850
a lunch that was not tradable.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.240
So I had completely
destroyed my social capital.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.300
Nobody wanted
anything that I had.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.110
And in elementary school,
that's a really big deal.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.640
All of a sudden you
find yourself not quite

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.170
fitting in with a group.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.350
I have to say that my father's
Confucian values kind of went

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.960
a little bit deeper
than just food

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.460
and language and
that type of thing.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.590
And his values were especially
pronounced and especially deep

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.260
in the area of
authority and humility,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.050
and how the different roles in
the family-- as the youngest

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.740
girl the family--
the different roles

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.240
that you played in the family.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.010
And what that meant
in our family,

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.420
with the respect for authority,
was that my dad was king.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.880
You did not question him,
you did not challenge him.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.589
You didn't look at him wrong.

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:22.079
Certainly not with any
direct eye contact.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.020
He also made it very clear
that my sister and I were not

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.990
to talk about our
accomplishments.

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.560
So we weren't to talk
about how well we did.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.560
And I have a distinct
memory of coming back home

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.290
one day after doing particularly
well on an assignment

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.750
and getting praise from
my peers and my teacher

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.960
and saying-- I was so excited,
I did great on this project.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.960
And he looked at me and
really frowned and said,

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.780
really adamantly, "that
is not for you to say".

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.360
It is not for you to say
that you did a good job.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.080
You let your teacher tell
you that you did a good job.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.190
And then don't say
anything about that.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:59.930
Don't even really accept it.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.740
Because they will
tell you when you're

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.700
doing a good job, and
that is your role.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.050
And that's what humility
looked like from my father.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.790
And I know for some
of you-- some of you

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.490
are nodding with this
experience-- and some of you

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.600
might be thinking, wow,
that's really foreign

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.950
or that's really harsh,
that he would do that.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.410
But for my father,
his value of humility

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.480
was so strong that he really
wanted to instill that in us.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.300
And that's what humility
looked like to him.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.670
Don't talk about yourself.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:28.930
Don't ever do that.

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.200
And it's the role
of the person who's

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.690
in authority, or the teacher,
to tell you what you're worth.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.270
So fast forward about 15 years.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.790
I'd started my
career in technology.

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.810
I thought I was doing pretty.

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:49.380
I was able to initiate a
lot of my career direction.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.020
I really loved
networking, and I thought

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.860
I was doing pretty well
in starting my career.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.340
And every once in
awhile, I would

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.300
have a moment where I felt
like I brought the wrong lunch.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.580
Where sometimes my
values didn't quite

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.610
match up with the
environment around me,

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.970
or I wasn't
communicating in a way

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.542
that everyone else
was communicating.

00:06:10.542 --> 00:06:12.000
Maybe I was a little
bit different.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.140
But I couldn't really
put my finger on it

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.760
until I started my own
marketing practice,

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.480
about six to seven
years into my career.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.820
And that's where I had an "aha"
moment about how my values

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.070
and how my cultural
background really

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.790
impacted how I behaved
in the workplace.

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:30.730
I had just started my
marketing practice,

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.700
and I was starting
to put out proposals

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.630
and talking to
prospective clients.

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.090
And in doing that,
I discovered I

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:41.930
had to put a dollar sign behind
my experience and my expertise.

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.350
And not only that,
I had to defend it.

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:47.820
And I remember being in
front of my future client

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.330
and talking about the proposal
and getting to that line item

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.340
and having him start
negotiating with me.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.680
And then I thought,
at that moment,

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.720
I realized I had
never in my career

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.680
talked about my value
in terms of my salary.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.310
I had never asked for a raise.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.250
I had never asked
for a promotion.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:10.030
Whenever I got a feedback
or performance review,

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:11.830
I just listened
to what was said.

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:15.110
Positive, constructive, and sort
of tried to run out of the room

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.780
quickly, because
it was something

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.260
that I was just going to accept.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.810
I was going to accept any
salary raise that I got,

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:26.400
because who would know better
than my boss what I was worth.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.640
So I learned that
that was not my job

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.080
to ascribe value to who I was.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.700
I was perfectly happy
with that until I

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.260
started my own business.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.910
And it was in that moment
that I learned I actually

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:41.350
had to play by a
different set of rules.

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:43.200
But I could still--
I had to think

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.110
through what my values were
with respect for authority,

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:49.730
with humility, and
decide how I was

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:51.830
going to act in that situation.

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:55.610
Because the person I was talking
to expected me to negotiate.

00:07:55.610 --> 00:08:00.480
They expected me to know my
own value and to defend it.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.190
And that was the
exchange I was having.

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:05.840
And in that moment I realized
that I had to do a little bit

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:10.120
to adapt to my environment,
and to understanding

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.850
what that played in my career.

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:16.170
This incident and many others
early in my career really

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:19.630
started me on this long journey
of doing some deep digging,

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:22.200
deep soul searching,
and really finding out

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.810
what was in my background.

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:25.820
Really what was
underneath the surface

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.440
that really impacted
how I communicated,

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.310
how I came across,
and ultimately

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:34.010
what perceptions were out
there about me in the workplace

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:36.870
where my career
decisions really mattered

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:41.330
and people were making judgments
on me based on what they saw.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:43.700
I think that might be
true for some of you,

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.470
that sometimes when you go
out there, if you are perhaps

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:49.475
different than the dominant
culture of your team

00:08:49.475 --> 00:08:52.710
or the organization, you might
maybe feel a little bit out

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:55.160
of place, or maybe
you fall outside

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.740
of the old boys' network.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:59.170
You might be communicating
a little bit different.

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:00.400
You might feel that.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.960
And what do you do
if you're different

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.250
from the dominant culture?

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:07.930
And maybe those
who are listening

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:10.030
who are in the
dominant culture, what

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:12.400
do you do when you see
or you experience someone

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.972
who is different than you?

00:09:13.972 --> 00:09:15.180
Who leads different than you?

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.930
Who communicates
different than you?

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:20.410
Who maybe seems to be exhibiting
behaviors that aren't what

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:23.300
you would consider
leadership potential.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.430
What do you do in
those situations?

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:28.940
And what do we all do to move
the conversation of diversity

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:31.700
just beyond a sectioned-off
department that

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.710
talks about differences
into the realm of management

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:36.320
and leadership development.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.900
So that's what I really
want to talk about,

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:42.970
is the changing landscape of
our workforce and our talent

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:44.530
and our environment.

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:46.672
How it's changing here
in the United States,

00:09:46.672 --> 00:09:48.880
and how that affects us,
because I think a lot of you

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.490
also have global
roles in addition

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:54.820
to perhaps working with a
lot of diverse team members.

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:59.955
So let's take a quick look just
through some of the numbers.

00:09:59.955 --> 00:10:02.190
We won't dwell too much
on this, but women now

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:04.580
make up about half
of the workforce,

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:09.590
and they hold about 70 percent
of global buying decisions.

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:13.300
Multiculturalists as a group,
36 percent of the labor force,

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.590
$3.3 trillion dollars
in buying power.

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:19.690
And millennials, the new
generation, 80 million

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:22.770
millennials comprising 46
percent of the labor force

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:24.030
by 2020.

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:27.712
And they also hold $1.3 trillion
dollars in buying power.

00:10:27.712 --> 00:10:29.170
And there's quite
a bit of research

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:32.740
that shows companies who
have diverse leadership

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:35.270
and workforces really have
a higher profitability

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:37.410
and increasing bottom line.

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:39.980
A recent Catalyst
report shows that there

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:44.140
is an increase in
sales by 73 percent,

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:47.840
and 83 percent return
on equity for companies

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:51.380
that had diverse board
and executive committees.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.650
Usually they were
doing a study on having

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:55.850
women in those
executive positions.

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:58.470
So we see that we have
this changing landscape.

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:00.120
We have a changing workforce.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.410
They actually have
quite a bit of influence

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:06.110
on both our companies
and the market.

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:07.350
It's quite a bit of power.

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:08.950
How do we leverage this?

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:12.740
And as we look at the
numbers, the workforce

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:16.660
is so different than when I
first started my career back

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:17.790
in the '90s.

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:19.790
And it's really
grown to present.

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:23.770
And in 2050, we're going
to see that there's

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:25.042
no majority culture.

00:11:25.042 --> 00:11:26.500
With the fastest-growing
population

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.780
being Latinos, and
currently in 2012,

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:34.030
Asians and Asian Americans
are the fastest-growing ethnic

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:36.020
group here in the United States.

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:42.470
And of course, Google-- just to
take a look at Google numbers--

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:45.080
how do they compare
against the growth

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.580
of the diverse
population in the States?

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:49.820
And I know you are very
familiar with these numbers

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:52.300
and what they mean, and
articles that have come out

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:55.160
about it over the
last number of weeks,

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.840
and sort of where
the opportunities are

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:02.942
to grow for women, as well as
African Americans and Latinos.

00:12:02.942 --> 00:12:04.650
I've have quite a
number of conversations

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:07.680
with people about
these Asian numbers.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.422
Because they look fantastic.

00:12:09.422 --> 00:12:11.630
And I'm going to show you
sort of the numbers overall

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:16.300
for the rest the United States
as far as how Asians are doing.

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:22.870
But with Asians being 30
percent of Google globally

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:28.260
and 23 percent of leadership,
that looks like it's great.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.820
So where do we go
from here, and what

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:33.120
are some of the questions
that arise from that?

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.660
Some of the questions that I
would have been in conversation

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:40.220
with Googlers is, these
are global numbers.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:43.870
What's the percentage of Asian
Americans here in the States

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:46.880
that are in leadership,
that are part of this, that

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.050
are part of the
fabric of Google?

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:51.390
And how many are
people who are here

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:54.220
who might be H1 visa holders?

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:56.430
What are the other
barriers that are presented

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:59.770
to Asian Americans in
their actual experience?

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:01.840
So I would be very
interested to continue

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.310
the conversation
with Google to see

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:07.670
what is the experience of
Asian Americans here Google.

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:10.970
What kind of engagement
issues, what kind of barriers

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:14.347
are people facing here,
are Googlers facing here,

00:13:14.347 --> 00:13:16.180
that they need to talk
about, that they need

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:18.560
to verbalize and take a look at.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:21.540
And as we look at that, we can
really look at the real issues

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:25.050
that impact the work,
as well as the numbers.

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:27.577
Because the numbers are a
really great place to start,

00:13:27.577 --> 00:13:29.910
but we have to move beyond
the numbers in representation

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:30.930
when we look at that.

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:32.050
So Asian Americans.

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:34.109
Where are we now?

00:13:34.109 --> 00:13:36.650
When we first started this work
with a lot of Asian Americans

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:40.700
and diversity back
in 2000, the numbers

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:44.850
were Asian Americans were
4.2 percent of population.

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:47.650
Now were 5.6 percent
of the population,

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:50.610
been the fastest-growing
ethnic group in the States.

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:55.190
Interestingly enough, 1.2
percent of Fortune 500 CEOs

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:56.290
are Asian.

00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:58.785
And now we're at 1.8.

00:13:58.785 --> 00:14:00.560
But that's actually fallen.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:06.390
In 2011, we had 15 Asian
CEOs, and now we have 10.

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:10.010
The trend is actually for
African American, Asian

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:14.637
American, as well as
Latinos, the trend

00:14:14.637 --> 00:14:16.470
is that there actually
has been a decreasing

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:20.040
number of CEOs in
the last five years.

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.310
So that's an
interesting statistic.

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:25.050
Corporate boards, we now
hold 2 percent of that.

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:27.415
We have a really high
rate of college graduates

00:14:27.415 --> 00:14:30.010
in the Asian
population, as well as

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:32.930
median income, which translates
to buying power in the market.

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:36.870
So currently we're at more than
$1 trillion in buying power.

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:38.250
So that's kind of where we are.

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:41.830
We have a great deal of
influence in the market.

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:44.320
We are very educated.

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.740
We're ready to go.

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:49.560
But the numbers are not
being reflected, really,

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.320
in leadership.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.880
So that's our story.

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.930
We're getting in the door.

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:58.080
And I'm hearing again and again
that we go through our careers

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:01.500
and somehow there's this
ceiling that happens,

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:04.720
and we're not necessarily
advancing into the leadership

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.230
positions and
positions of influence.

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:09.980
And that really affects,
I think, the way

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:12.980
we are seen in the workplace.

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:15.320
And there are a lot of
stories that are out there.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.340
So I just wanted to
take a quick look

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:21.045
at some of these stories
that are out there.

00:15:21.045 --> 00:15:23.045
Some of these narratives
that are out there that

00:15:23.045 --> 00:15:25.660
are being told about Asians.

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:27.500
Let me just start
with this first one.

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:30.410
Asians don't really want to be
in top leadership and executive

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:31.230
roles.

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:31.980
What do you think?

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:33.812
Is that a myth or a fact?

00:15:33.812 --> 00:15:35.020
What do you think about that?

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.112
It's a fact.

00:15:40.112 --> 00:15:42.320
Well actually we had a little
conversation about this

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.300
at lunch time, because
there are actually--

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:47.490
when I talk to Asians, I
get different responses

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:49.440
about their career aspirations.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:53.190
But this is actually a myth that
is quite prevalent out there.

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:56.420
When managers talk about
Asians and Asian Americans

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:58.810
and their career aspiration,
what I hear a lot is,

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:00.290
I don't hear from them.

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:02.600
They don't tell me, "I want
that stretch assignment".

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.600
Or they didn't tell me
they wanted that new role

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.340
or that their aspiration
is to make partner.

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:09.950
They didn't say that.

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:12.940
There's an interesting study
that came out from the Center

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:16.140
for Talent Innovation in New
York City headed by Sylvia Ann

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:16.920
Hewlett.

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:19.780
And this study talks
about Asians in America.

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:22.380
They interviewed 3,000
people nationwide,

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:24.780
and they talk to Asians
and Asian Americans

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:26.040
about their careers.

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.440
And what's interesting
is that 64 percent

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:33.960
of Asian professionals said
that they wanted top jobs.

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.440
And it was greater
than the number

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.930
of Caucasian professionals
that also expressed

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:41.420
the same kind of
aspirations for top jobs.

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:44.560
So it's not that Asians don't
want to be in leadership.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:48.030
If that's the myth, that's the
perception, it's just not true.

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:50.480
And of course, I don't know
those numbers for Google,

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:53.850
but I would suspect that Asian
Americans and Asians really

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:59.130
want to get ahead, and there may
be this myth that they don't.

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:00.990
The other statistic
that's very interesting

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:04.800
is that 63 percent of Asian
men, 44 percent of Asian women,

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.450
feel stalled in their careers.

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:09.500
And 19 percent of Asian men
and 14 percent of Asian women

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:13.089
plan to leave their company
within the next year.

00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:17.160
So organizations are faced--
and they should be afraid

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.880
that they're going to lose some
of their best talent because

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.230
of disengagement.

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:28.220
In a Gallup survey, they found
that about $450 billion to $550

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:31.740
billion is what is lost
by companies from employee

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:34.127
disengagement every year.

00:17:34.127 --> 00:17:36.210
So if you lose an employee,
you can't retain them,

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:39.830
they don't stay engaged, they're
not going to be in a place

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:42.090
where they can actually
feel like they're

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:43.530
bringing themselves to work.

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:47.260
It's not going to work out
for retaining that employee.

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.140
It's costing companies
a lot of money.

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:54.060
What do you think
about this statement?

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:56.840
It's best to be "color-blind"
and not really important

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:59.420
to focus on differences
in the workplace.

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.460
After all, it's
just about respect

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:03.339
and treating everyone the same.

00:18:03.339 --> 00:18:04.380
Treating everyone fairly.

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:07.670
What do you think
about that statement?

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:09.000
No?

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.130
Any comments about that?

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:12.850
Have you heard that
statement going around?

00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:14.490
Great to be colorblind?

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:16.360
We're a post-racial
society, right?

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.470
We have Obama in the office.

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:20.761
There are no barriers
anymore, right?

00:18:20.761 --> 00:18:22.510
What's interesting
about this statement is

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:25.640
there are a lot of people who
do think this is a great thing,

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:28.211
to be color blind or to
not notice differences,

00:18:28.211 --> 00:18:30.460
because it sounds like, if
we don't notice differences

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:32.014
and we don't have
to talk about them,

00:18:32.014 --> 00:18:33.180
there won't be any conflict.

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:37.550
We can just appeal to the
universal values of fairness

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:39.840
and respect, and
everything will be good.

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.870
But actually, what
we can't get beyond

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:47.070
is unconscious, inherent
biases that we all

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:49.700
have toward each other,
and the judgments

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:54.250
that actually are reached
even without us realizing it.

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:57.340
I was reading about
Laszlo Bock and engaging

00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:00.730
Doctor Brian Wells here Google
to do quite a number of studies

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:03.100
on unconscious bias and
what they discovered.

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:07.850
There's also a number of studies
done by Harvard Business School

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:11.110
and Doctor [INAUDIBLE]
and University of Virginia

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:12.900
that talk about
unconscious bias,

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.150
where they've actually
found that people--

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:18.380
as an example of one of the
tests that they've done,

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:22.200
they had a list of positive
traits, positive adjectives,

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:26.940
and people actually correlated
that with Caucasians.

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:28.200
Caucasian people.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.770
Caucasian faces.

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:32.500
And then they gave people
a list of negative traits

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.360
and negative
adjectives, and those

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:36.230
were more likely
to be correlated

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:39.080
with African American
and minority faces.

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:43.410
And those correlations
show those kind of biases.

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:46.100
So really I think
when-- Doctor Wells,

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:49.120
it was reported when he started
doing this work with Google,

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:52.740
he also found that there was
a systemic bias against women.

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:55.330
And that's why
women have not risen

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:56.870
to the ranks of leadership.

00:19:56.870 --> 00:20:00.910
So it's a very interesting
thing to see how bias works out.

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:04.710
And also dangerous is the idea
of color blindness itself.

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:09.810
Because why do we want
to not see differences?

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:12.890
Differences are actually
what brings that innovation

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:16.420
and, ultimately, productivity
into the companies.

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:17.340
Into your teams.

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.020
Into the work that you do.

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:20.710
And what's interesting
is another study

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:26.800
that was done at
Harvard talks about how,

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:30.730
when you get a team
together that's diverse,

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:35.010
the team actually is
chaotic and full of conflict

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:37.910
and actually very
unproductive when they first

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:40.240
start working together.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.660
And the only thing
that will help

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:45.170
that team become
productive and innovative

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:48.140
is if the leader of that team
and the people in the team

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:51.710
understand how to integrate and
recognize their differences,

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:55.560
and appreciate how that
adds value to the team.

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:57.880
There's actually a lot
of skills and training

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.280
that needs to happen
before you get

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.730
all these different opinions
and different backgrounds

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:06.100
into a room, and styles, before
it can become productive.

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:07.650
So the argument
that, oh we just need

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:11.010
to treat everybody the same, and
just to sort of lump leadership

00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:13.250
development into
this general category

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:15.680
and hope that we
will get it, actually

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:19.630
doesn't go with how
we're hardwired.

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:21.920
Because we are actually--
neuroscientists

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:24.110
and behavioral
scientists, they really

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:26.260
have done a lot
of studies to say,

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:30.380
when we see someone different
than us, we run away

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:31.910
or we get really defensive.

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:35.070
Because if there's something
unknown and unfamiliar,

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:36.780
we're not going
to flock to that.

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:38.250
And we see that
that's especially

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:40.900
dangerous in this
homosocio phenomenon

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:43.870
where we like people
who are like us.

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:48.270
Which means in the workplace,
we hire people who look like us,

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:50.640
we promote people
who look like us,

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:52.500
and we gravitate
toward people, when

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:55.787
we're thinking about
mentoring, who look like us.

00:21:55.787 --> 00:21:57.870
I can't tell you the number
of times I've actually

00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:00.380
heard people say, oh
I've met this person

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:03.770
and I can't wait to start
mentoring them and coaching

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:04.410
them.

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:06.170
They're just like me!

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:08.190
I've got a mini-me,
and we're going

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:11.200
to have a whole
team of mini-mes.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.760
People act so excited
when they find

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:15.270
that, they find someone
who's just like them.

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:17.110
And that is a natural tendency.

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:19.490
So when we start looking
at these natural tendencies

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:21.780
that we all have, what
do we do about them?

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:23.140
Unconscious bias.

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:25.580
And speaking of bias,
I think this is really

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:29.150
an interesting-- one of the
latest studies in talking

00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:32.590
about the ceiling for
Asians and Asian Americans

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:33.470
has just come out.

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:36.440
And let's take a look
at this myth or fact.

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:40.710
If Asians just developed more
assertive leadership styles,

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:42.210
they would advance
in their careers.

00:22:45.701 --> 00:22:47.200
What do you think
of that statement?

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.740
Have you heard that before?

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:50.240
Yeah?

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.646
So it seems true, right?

00:22:51.646 --> 00:22:53.020
And we want to
believe it's true.

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:55.740
If we just acted
more like leaders,

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:59.130
it would be great
for our careers.

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:01.440
But I want to say
what's interesting is,

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:05.780
the University of Toronto
released a study in 2012 that

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:10.700
talks about how the bias is
so strong that they found

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:16.700
that East Asian leaders that
behaved with a dominant style--

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:19.080
if they were warm, if
they were personable,

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:21.540
and if they had a
very strong style,

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:25.890
they were actually disliked more
than any other style of people.

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:28.100
So people would actually
like and would rather

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:31.470
work with an East Asian
who is non-dominant

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:34.910
or a Caucasian who is
dominant or non-dominant.

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:38.250
And the stereotype, explicit
stereotype, that they tested

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:42.500
was that East Asians
were cold, they

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:46.620
were competent, extremely
so, and non-dominant.

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:49.250
And the expectation
of East Asians

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:51.420
was that they stay
in their place.

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:52.900
They stay in their place.

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:56.410
And when Asians behaved
outside of these stereotypes,

00:23:56.410 --> 00:24:00.310
they were harassed for it, or
they were seen unfavorably.

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:02.700
So I looked at the results
of the study and I thought,

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:04.650
what do we do about this myth?

00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:06.880
What do we do about
this, because we're

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:10.890
being asked to behave more
assertively, but what we do,

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:12.590
we're disliked.

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:14.710
And that also works against us.

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:16.250
So I have to say,
when I saw this,

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:19.500
I thought, organizations
and upper management

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:22.530
and people who are really
guiding and mentoring

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:26.830
and hiring and promoting people
within their organizations,

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:30.060
really need to take a look
at their unconscious bias.

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:32.880
We really need to change
how we see leadership

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:34.910
and the leadership styles
that are out there,

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:37.910
when we see people acting
outside of stereotype

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:40.760
trying to better their
leadership development

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:44.190
and really think, how are
we going to start working?

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:45.670
What do Asians do about this?

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:48.590
I think it's really
an art to do--

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:51.200
we're going to start talking
a little bit about flexing

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.160
and what we can do
in these situations--

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:54.400
to actually change this.

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:57.490
Because these are
narratives are happening.

00:24:57.490 --> 00:25:00.190
These are stories about
Asians and Asian Americans

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:03.770
that are out there that
we have to confront.

00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:05.780
I think maybe some
of you have heard

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:09.470
these stories, these narratives
about Asian Americans.

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:11.550
They're about Asian
Americans, but they're not

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:13.050
by Asian Americans.

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:14.650
So we have someone--
we have people

00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:18.030
out there telling these
stories about us, about Asians,

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:21.340
and not necessarily
having our input to get

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:24.820
the full fabric, the
full story of us.

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:27.590
The first one is the
model minority myth.

00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:30.860
How many have heard of
the model minority myth?

00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:36.310
In the 1960s, sociologists wrote
about Asians-- specifically,

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:38.660
at the time, Japanese
Americans-- being

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:41.530
the model minority
immigrants that

00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:44.850
came to the States
who did really well.

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:48.090
And they sort of pitted
that story, that narrative,

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:50.450
against other minority groups.

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:53.660
Because the thought was,
they came, they did it,

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:55.300
so there's no barrier.

00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:59.120
So if you're not making it,
it's probably your fault.

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:01.260
It doesn't have anything
to do with the system.

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:04.500
And the idea is,
it also invalidated

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:06.390
a lot of what Asians
and Asian Americans

00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:08.380
have to say about
their own experience,

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:11.490
about quote unquote what
their experience was

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:14.250
making it and actually
working in the United States.

00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:17.290
So that is also a
myth because it's not

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:18.500
even true for all Asians.

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:21.049
There's a 13 percent
poverty rate for Asians,

00:26:21.049 --> 00:26:22.840
in the different groups
of Asians, as well.

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:26.730
So they're not all
experiencing this huge success

00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:28.600
that everyone is
talking about as we

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.150
think about the
model minority myth.

00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:32.430
So it's very incomplete
when we look at that.

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:35.810
Also the perpetual
foreigner syndrome.

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:38.810
The same implicit
bias test that was

00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:42.450
created by Doctor
[INAUDIBLE] at Harvard

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:46.450
showed a test where a
bunch of celebrities

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:48.080
were shown flashed
on the screen,

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:51.010
flashed in front of the
participants, the test takers.

00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:56.580
And celebrities like Michael
Chang, Kristie Yamaguchi,

00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:58.610
they were identified
as foreigners,

00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:02.400
while Hugh Grant,
and Katarina Witt

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:05.670
were identified as Americans.

00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:08.380
And they're not Americans.

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:11.080
But it was clear that the
bias for Asians-- they

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:14.670
didn't necessarily see Asians
as people from America.

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:17.580
And I have to say that
my own experiences would

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:20.030
echo that, even though I'm
shocked every time it happens.

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:23.670
Earlier this year with at
JFK, New York City airport.

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:27.670
And I was sitting there in
line and someone approached me

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:30.260
and said, hey are
you going to Hawaii?

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:33.055
I said, no, I'm not
going to Hawaii.

00:27:33.055 --> 00:27:34.110
Why do you ask that?

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:36.020
Because I didn't
have any indicators

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:37.260
that I was going to Hawaii.

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:38.676
And he said, oh,
because there are

00:27:38.676 --> 00:27:40.480
a lot of people who
look like you there.

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.280
And I thought wow.

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:42.794
OK.

00:27:42.794 --> 00:27:45.210
Well there are a lot of people
who look like me here, too.

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:48.110
So this bias, I
think you thought

00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:50.500
you might have had
experiences like this.

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:54.340
What it really is, including
all the stereotypical behaviors

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:58.000
that might be associated with
a lot of Asian Americans,

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.850
these narratives that are
about us really add up

00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:05.270
to a question about
not just the fact

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:08.200
that Asians aren't in the
numbers for leadership--

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:12.280
and are Asians
leaders-- but do Asians

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:14.960
have leadership potential?

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:17.420
Are they ready for leadership?

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:21.425
Are they ready to be part
of the influential voice

00:28:21.425 --> 00:28:24.460
of organizations and causes.

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:26.620
And that's why I
think that we have

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:28.580
to take a look at
these narratives.

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:31.130
We really have to
look at them and say,

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:33.020
what is our voice in this?

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:34.680
What is our narrative?

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:37.380
When we're putting it out
there, the more narratives

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:39.790
and the more stories we
have about our background

00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:42.750
and how we approach
our careers, how

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:46.290
we approach leadership,
how we approach our work--

00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:48.400
the more that gets out
there, the more people

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.270
will start seeing
and having options

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:53.270
to understand what
the full picture is.

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:56.360
One of the models I've found
very helpful in my work

00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:00.230
is, when we talk about culture,
we look at the iceberg.

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:03.890
Iceberg, 1/10 of it
is above the surface.

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:08.290
And what does someone see
when they first meet you?

00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:10.750
What do they
experience about you?

00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:12.050
Language.

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:13.540
Your dress, maybe.

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:14.860
What you eat.

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:15.970
Behavior.

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:17.610
The way you talk.

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:20.580
All of those things
are above the surface.

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:25.130
But there is a full
9/10 below the surface

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:28.070
that people do not see.

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:31.120
When people saw me eat
my Chinese food at lunch,

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:34.650
they didn't necessarily ask me
all of the cultural elements

00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:37.190
and values and things
that came with that.

00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:40.390
They just saw what I was
doing on the surface.

00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:44.370
So it's really important
that we understand

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:45.970
how to get beneath
the surface when

00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:48.150
we have this conversation
of difference.

00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:49.926
And sometimes it's
helpful for us

00:29:49.926 --> 00:29:51.550
to know how to get
beneath the surface,

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:53.590
because what's
underneath the surface

00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:56.700
are those cultural values
and things that I call,

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:57.970
basically, part of your core.

00:29:57.970 --> 00:29:59.410
Your personality.

00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:00.860
Your expertise.

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:04.230
Your years of experience
that really play into it

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:07.970
and influence ultimately
your behavior.

00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:09.950
And then perception.

00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:11.990
And as you unpack
that, you can start

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:14.630
to see, what's my own narrative?

00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:18.300
What are my values that
drive what people see,

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:21.000
and what perception
is happening?

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.980
And so when you
start unpacking that,

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:26.680
it's interesting because-- let's
take the value of humility,

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:31.170
which is a very, very strong
Asian Confucian value.

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:35.040
If that is a very strong
value that I have,

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:38.980
the action might be that I don't
talk about my accomplishments.

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:42.460
That might be what
humility looks like to me.

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:48.430
But the perception I'm hoping
is that people think I'm humble.

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:50.670
Because I'm so humble, right?

00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:55.870
But the perception
in a Western culture

00:30:55.870 --> 00:31:00.265
isn't that you're humble, it's
that you don't have confidence

00:31:00.265 --> 00:31:02.390
and that you don't know
how to talk about yourself.

00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:05.350
Maybe you're not
even a contributor,

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:07.280
and you don't even
have that expertise.

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:09.920
So the perception is
completely different than what

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:12.050
I hope to project out there.

00:31:12.050 --> 00:31:13.845
And when I take a
look at this equation

00:31:13.845 --> 00:31:16.250
and I look at the
dynamics of this,

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:19.300
I have to ask myself--
is there a way that I

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:23.920
can keep who I am, with
my value of humility,

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.280
and have it look different
on the action side

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:28.650
but still retain
my value so that I

00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:30.440
can manage that perception?

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:33.740
Because I want people to
experience me in a certain way,

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:37.760
is there a way I could talk
about myself in a humble way

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.239
and still keep my values?

00:31:39.239 --> 00:31:41.030
And that's really the
opportunity, I think,

00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:43.840
is for us to look at
the values that we have.

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:46.790
And for Asians,
traditionally Asian values

00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:50.750
are respect for
authority-- we really

00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:53.490
look at authority
in a way that we

00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:55.920
like to keep the distance
because that means we respect

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:58.740
them, so oftentimes we
don't speak up in meetings

00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:00.890
when our boss is
there, and sometimes

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:03.060
we may not talk
about who we are,

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:05.270
talk about accomplishments,
as I mentioned.

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:08.200
Humility is a great
example of a value.

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:09.670
Collectivism.

00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:12.960
We don't necessarily
think in terms of "I."

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:14.130
We think in terms of "we."

00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:15.880
So when we talk about
our accomplishments,

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:19.300
maybe we talk about what we
did instead of what I did.

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:22.870
And if we're in a very
individualistic environment--

00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:25.020
as America and Western
corporations are

00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:28.540
very individualistic--
we might butt heads

00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:31.116
with people who had different
values, who see that, wow, you

00:32:31.116 --> 00:32:32.240
didn't talk about yourself.

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:33.790
You used the word "we".

00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:35.720
You don't talk about
your accomplishments,

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:39.220
and you're not
necessarily standing out.

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:41.626
And they see you as someone
who's not remarkable.

00:32:41.626 --> 00:32:43.000
You don't stand
out in the crowd.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.510
But you think you're
behaving in a way that

00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:51.070
is very successful for
how you were raised.

00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:55.090
Other values that play into
very traditional Asian values

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:57.380
are saving face.

00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:00.030
A lot of indirect communication.

00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:02.680
And the idea of fate.

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:03.570
Long suffering.

00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:05.380
If you're seeing a
barrier or you're

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:07.300
going through a
really hard time,

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:11.120
you don't necessarily raise your
hand and be the squeaky wheel.

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.850
You're going to just sort of
hunker down, put your head

00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:15.060
down, and get through it.

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:16.850
And that might be
how you deal with it.

00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:18.540
And the way other
people perceive

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:20.920
you may be just
that you don't know

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:22.850
how to speak up for yourself.

00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:25.612
You don't initiate change.

00:33:25.612 --> 00:33:27.320
You don't go and raise
your hand and say,

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:28.861
I can do something
about it because I

00:33:28.861 --> 00:33:30.380
believe I can
change my situation.

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:32.600
And when people see
that, that's actually

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:33.740
a dangerous perception.

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:36.847
Because they might not
go through this process

00:33:36.847 --> 00:33:39.430
where they're trying to figure
out what's beneath the surface.

00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:42.330
They're thinking, that person
doesn't take initiative.

00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:44.990
I guess they're not
really a leader.

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:46.670
So this process of
looking through it--

00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:49.550
as we were doing research
for the book, Jane and I

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:53.640
looked at more than 100
leaders that we interviewed.

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.090
And the leaders that
we found were the most

00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:59.090
successful-- in their
career, in navigating

00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:02.610
across the different cultures
throughout their career,

00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:05.880
and were quite senior in
their roles-- they were also

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:07.910
really great at this.

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:09.810
Getting beneath the surface.

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:14.989
Finding out, and being curious
about, not just the behavior,

00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:17.860
not just perceptions and
not just their biases,

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:20.040
but really questioning
their assumptions

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:23.511
and getting the real story
and having the conversation

00:34:23.511 --> 00:34:25.969
with the people around them
who were a little bit different

00:34:25.969 --> 00:34:28.739
than them.

00:34:28.739 --> 00:34:31.750
They had those traits, and we
called them fluent leaders.

00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:33.790
And we found that
these fluent leaders

00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:35.800
were really able
to do this well.

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:38.030
And that's what
we're looking at when

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:40.600
we're looking at successful
global leaders and people who

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:41.820
work with diverse teams.

00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:48.540
For Asian Americans, I
think the tips are really

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:50.639
understanding the context.

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:52.350
Understanding the
unwritten rules

00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:55.560
of the game that actually are
running that people don't tell

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:59.210
you when you first are
onboarded at Google, that this

00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:01.630
is how you succeed here.

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:03.330
This is how you do it.

00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:07.160
Understanding that context,
understanding the narratives

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:11.900
that are going on about
Asians and Asian Americans.

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:13.670
Understanding stereotypes.

00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:16.350
Knowing that context
really helps you

00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:18.090
when you start your
career, when you

00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:20.280
start working for
career success.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:23.672
And also the idea of
flexing, which Erica

00:35:23.672 --> 00:35:25.380
shared with you in
the beginning of this.

00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:29.730
We call it the art of switching
behaviors and styles in order

00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:32.160
to communicate with those
who are different than you.

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:35.080
So basically, can you talk to
the person across the table

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:36.050
from you?

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:37.240
Are you on the same page?

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:38.930
Are you speaking
the same language?

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:41.950
And are you able to
communicate with them?

00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:45.290
Do you even know if
you're relating with them?

00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:49.950
The onus here is partly on
us, but it's also partly

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:53.895
on the managers, the people who
mentor, the people who develop,

00:35:53.895 --> 00:35:57.960
the people in the minority,
Asian Americans included.

00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:00.330
As they're looking,
do they flex?

00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:01.390
Do they flex to us?

00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:02.730
Do we flex to them?

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:04.650
Are we able to
understand our style

00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:08.616
so well that we can identify
when we need to flex?

00:36:08.616 --> 00:36:10.490
And this is really
important because it's not

00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:14.024
about style compliance, which
is the old way of doing it.

00:36:14.024 --> 00:36:15.690
You have the dominant
culture, everybody

00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:17.840
walks in, everyone
has to act like that.

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:19.290
Women have to wear ties, right.

00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:21.530
So we're not talking
about compliance.

00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:23.360
We're talking about adapting.

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:26.440
And let me just share an
interesting story about

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:29.780
an executive, Bobbi Silten who
at the time was the president

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:32.460
of the Dockers brand at Levi's.

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:37.630
And Bobbi Silten actually
when people heard her name

00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:39.670
thought she was a
man, Caucasian man.

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:42.250
And then she would walk into
the boardroom or the meeting

00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:43.935
that she was going
to and people would

00:36:43.935 --> 00:36:45.760
be completely taken aback.

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:48.560
First of all, Bobbi
Silten was not a man.

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:51.430
And She was a
petite Asian woman.

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:54.960
And she sat down-- she actually
has a very-- she describes it

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:58.820
as a warm, very open
style, very relational.

00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:01.646
She wants to sit down and
start to get to know people.

00:37:01.646 --> 00:37:03.520
And she found that this
style, even though it

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.800
was very genuine
to who she was, she

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:08.490
had to adapt it a little
bit, because sometimes

00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:12.440
the stereotypes that people
had and those judgments

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:15.540
and assessments that people had
about her when they saw her,

00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:17.340
she had to counter them.

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:20.230
She had to actually get down to
business right away for people

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:23.297
to take her seriously,
for people to say yeah,

00:37:23.297 --> 00:37:24.130
she knows her stuff.

00:37:24.130 --> 00:37:24.820
She's an expert.

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:26.380
She belongs here in this room.

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:29.430
She had to kind of
adapt her style and flex

00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:32.360
to the environment and the
context that she was in.

00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:33.820
Did it change who she was?

00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:35.670
No, she was still
the same person.

00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:37.240
Still warm, still relational.

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:38.990
But she was very aware
of her environment

00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:42.100
and how she needed to behave
in that moment at that time.

00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:44.590
So I think that's a challenge,
is that we understand

00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:46.920
the contexts in which
we need to flex.

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:50.860
And lastly, also we have to
understand our narrative.

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:53.300
We have to know
this process of what

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:56.230
is beneath the surface
for us so well that we

00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:57.870
can tell that story.

00:37:57.870 --> 00:37:59.300
And then we have to defend it.

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:00.840
We have to defend
our lunch, right?

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:04.350
We have to tell our story
and stand behind it, and see

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:07.870
if that style actually
offers something of value

00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:11.260
that somebody may
not have seen before.

00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:13.250
Someone asked me,
OK so if you have

00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:15.460
a different kind of
communication style,

00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:17.780
is there any way that you
can kind of let people know

00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:21.010
that that actually really
works in the situation?

00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:21.900
Absolutely.

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:25.500
If you have a style that
is a little bit more quiet,

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:28.880
if you're more collectivistic
and you look to get buy-in

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:30.980
and you're really
effective at that,

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:34.340
if you're a little bit
more emotionally restrained

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:38.570
and you're able to actually
not kneejerk react in crisis

00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:43.040
situations, those are all things
that could be really great when

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:45.070
you're managing a team
or you have a project

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:46.444
with a lot of fire drills.

00:38:46.444 --> 00:38:47.860
And you're not
reacting and you're

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:50.220
thoughtfully strategic
in the way you manage

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:52.940
your team and your
resources, those

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:56.390
are things that if you know that
come from who you really are

00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:58.450
and your values,
and you present it

00:38:58.450 --> 00:39:02.320
to somebody, to your manager,
to the people at Google,

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:05.330
people might say, oh my gosh,
I didn't think of it that way.

00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:09.304
When I think of a leader, I
think of someone who's strong,

00:39:09.304 --> 00:39:10.720
someone who's
charismatic, someone

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:13.130
who's outgoing and extroverted.

00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:14.970
And those are very,
very common biases

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:17.010
for what leaders look like.

00:39:17.010 --> 00:39:18.874
So when you tell your
story, all of a sudden

00:39:18.874 --> 00:39:20.290
we have a different
story for what

00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:23.190
another leader looks
like in that context.

00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:26.610
And I was just sharing
over lunch with some

00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:30.210
[INAUDIBLE] leaders
that people don't always

00:39:30.210 --> 00:39:33.020
know what they
haven't seen before.

00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:36.760
Joshua Bell, who was
a violinist virtuoso,

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:39.990
did an experiment with
Washington Post many years ago

00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:44.280
where he set his violin case
down in the Washington subway

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.160
and started playing.

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:48.905
And people didn't
notice him at all.

00:39:48.905 --> 00:39:50.530
The funny thing is,
a couple hours went

00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:53.120
by-- if you had gone to
see him in Carnegie Hall,

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:55.162
you would have probably
paid about $200 a ticket,

00:39:55.162 --> 00:39:57.828
and you would've clapped and you
would've been like, oh my gosh,

00:39:57.828 --> 00:39:59.310
I saw Joshua Bell
at Carnegie Hall.

00:39:59.310 --> 00:40:01.400
And it would've been this
great experience for you,

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:03.210
and you would have said, he's
the most amazing violinist

00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:03.980
I've ever heard.

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:06.420
But when he was in the
subway, nobody knew.

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:09.350
Because we might find a
Picasso in the dumpster.

00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:12.580
But we don't know it until
someone puts a frame around it,

00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:15.110
a didactic panel,
and auctions it off.

00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:17.200
And says, this is the value.

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:18.830
So maybe that's
what we need to do.

00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:20.880
We actually need
to frame our value.

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:24.990
We need to share this
narrative with people

00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:26.615
so that we can start
this conversation

00:40:26.615 --> 00:40:29.520
and we can flex across
the differences.

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:32.320
This is really an art,
it's not a science,

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:33.740
and it requires practice.

00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:37.580
I know that all of us have
many situations every day

00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:38.690
that we can practice.

00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:40.310
And one of the
dimensions-- I just

00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:43.980
want to share a dimension,
a couple dimensions,

00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:50.350
with you that talk to
understanding differences.

00:40:50.350 --> 00:40:52.290
One of the differences
that we noted,

00:40:52.290 --> 00:40:54.510
borrowed from
cultural anthropology,

00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:56.660
is the difference
of the power gap.

00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:59.740
And this is a very critical
dimension to understand,

00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:02.580
because we've found that people
who understood the power gap

00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:05.260
and knew how to bridge
the power gap actually

00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:08.600
were the ones that were the
most effective at flexing.

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:11.910
The power gap is
basically the distance

00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:15.510
between the different levels
of hierarchy that exist.

00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:17.270
There are formal power gaps.

00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:20.840
Every organization
has a hierarchy

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:23.960
between bosses, the
titles and the authority

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:27.470
that's given to people
in different positions.

00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:29.300
But there are also
informal power gaps

00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:31.580
between people in
different departments--

00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:34.550
maybe one's function is
valued over the other-- even

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:35.720
between peers.

00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:38.430
There are power gaps between
mentors and mentees, people

00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:40.130
who are coaching.

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:42.690
So these levels of hierarchy
are very important,

00:41:42.690 --> 00:41:45.490
and that distance
often keeps people

00:41:45.490 --> 00:41:47.966
from building relationships.

00:41:47.966 --> 00:41:49.840
And there are two extremes
in that power gap,

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:52.790
in the way people
prefer to work.

00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:56.820
So we might have someone on the
egalitarian end of the power

00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:58.800
gap, where they
have a preference

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:00.700
for actually
minimizing that gap.

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:03.520
They say OK, I'm your boss,
I'm an egalitarian boss,

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:05.980
and I'm your boss
and I have this team.

00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:08.980
But I'm not going to exert
my authority over them.

00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:10.210
I'm not going to be the boss.

00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:12.010
I'm here to guide.

00:42:12.010 --> 00:42:14.340
I want to listen to their ideas.

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:17.510
I'm really proud, if I have
an egalitarian preference,

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:19.960
that I have an open door policy.

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:21.630
We hear this a lot.

00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:24.660
I expect my team members
to come into my office,

00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:27.620
chat, get to know me a little
bit, I'll get to know them.

00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:29.410
We'll share ideas.

00:42:29.410 --> 00:42:31.230
We'll talk about
questions they have.

00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:32.964
They can even challenge me.

00:42:32.964 --> 00:42:33.880
They can challenge me.

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:35.380
They can look me
directly in the eye

00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:38.310
and say, Audrey, I'm not
sure if that's going to work.

00:42:38.310 --> 00:42:39.890
Or I have a problem with that.

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:42.070
Or this is where I
want my career to go.

00:42:42.070 --> 00:42:43.800
I'd really like that
stretch assignment.

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:46.606
And if I'm an egalitarian
boss, I'm OK with that.

00:42:46.606 --> 00:42:50.370
That doesn't usurp my
respect or my authority.

00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:51.290
It's perfectly fine.

00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:52.700
I want that.

00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:54.520
But if I have a team
member that doesn't

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:57.520
do that when I've invited them
to do that, I might think,

00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:01.290
oh my gosh, that person
has no initiative.

00:43:01.290 --> 00:43:03.171
That person's a
really hard worker.

00:43:03.171 --> 00:43:05.170
They do a really great
job with their teammates,

00:43:05.170 --> 00:43:07.490
but they're not leaders.

00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:10.870
They're not somebody I can count
on for that stretch assignment.

00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:14.180
So if you're the other end, the
other extreme of the power gap

00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:17.830
preference, you
might think, I think

00:43:17.830 --> 00:43:21.050
about the gap as
something that translates

00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:22.720
to respect for authority.

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:25.990
So if you have that preference,
it's a hierarchical preference.

00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:28.540
Asian cultures
tend to norm toward

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:29.820
hierarchical preferences.

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:31.653
And there are many other
cultures and groups

00:43:31.653 --> 00:43:33.360
that do, as well.

00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:35.247
So as someone with a
hierarchical preference,

00:43:35.247 --> 00:43:37.830
you don't want to be on the same
level as your boss or someone

00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:40.980
who's in authority, because
that's not your level,

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:43.960
and it's not your place
to be at that level.

00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:47.440
So that gap represents
your sign of respect.

00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:52.830
You're going to let that boss
or that superior call the shots,

00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:56.360
give directions, be the person
that speaks up in the meeting.

00:43:56.360 --> 00:44:00.760
And depending on how wide that
gap is for you, that's the way

00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:02.460
you think it should be.

00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:04.610
And so if you have a
boss that says, hey you,

00:44:04.610 --> 00:44:05.855
I expect you to come to me.

00:44:05.855 --> 00:44:08.355
You might be thinking, that
boss is not a really great boss,

00:44:08.355 --> 00:44:10.680
because they're not
doing their job.

00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:12.930
They're not being that director.

00:44:12.930 --> 00:44:17.540
They're not being that
strong boss that I need.

00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:21.250
And the concept for,
again, for a lot of Asians

00:44:21.250 --> 00:44:24.090
who have this very strong
hierarchical preference,

00:44:24.090 --> 00:44:27.842
is that when they're ready,
their boss will tell them.

00:44:27.842 --> 00:44:29.550
They'll tap them on
the shoulder and say,

00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:30.847
you're ready for that raise.

00:44:30.847 --> 00:44:32.180
You're ready for that promotion.

00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:33.680
Or you're ready for
this assignment.

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:35.500
And when that
doesn't happen, they

00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:38.922
might get frustrated, because
that's the boss's job.

00:44:38.922 --> 00:44:40.380
So what do we do
to close this gap,

00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:44.210
and what happens
in the situation?

00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:47.370
An egalitarian boss,
how do they flex

00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:51.400
to a more hierarchical employee?

00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:54.770
I think there's an opportunity
here for that egalitarian boss

00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:56.520
to close the gap.

00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:58.170
First of all, by
having a conversation.

00:44:58.170 --> 00:45:01.510
They might identify again
what's underneath the surface,

00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:05.630
and ask that employee, I
noticed these behaviors.

00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:08.890
I notice that I never
see in my office.

00:45:08.890 --> 00:45:10.840
I know you have a
lot of ideas, but I

00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:12.940
don't hear you bring
them up in meetings.

00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:14.560
What's going on?

00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:16.980
And just really start digging
underneath the surface

00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:18.470
to see what are
those motivations

00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:21.760
and values that
they can actually

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:24.670
translate into behaviors and
talk about how effective it

00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:26.720
is in that context.

00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:31.270
And maybe that egalitarian boss,
in order to flex to this style,

00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:33.710
might actually give
permission to say,

00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:35.630
you know what, you
have great ideas.

00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:38.370
I'd like to hear you speak
up in the next meeting.

00:45:38.370 --> 00:45:39.850
I'm going to call on you.

00:45:39.850 --> 00:45:41.180
Just so you're prepared.

00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:43.080
Or, I'm going to put
you on the agenda,

00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:45.400
and actually want you to
talk about it this time.

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:47.040
You're going to talk
about this topic.

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:50.130
That's really one way
that they can reach out

00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:51.630
to close that gap.

00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:54.222
We've talked about this with
several managers before,

00:45:54.222 --> 00:45:55.930
and the question that
inevitably comes up

00:45:55.930 --> 00:45:58.619
is, wow I don't know if I want
to do all that handholding.

00:45:58.619 --> 00:46:00.910
Sounds really high maintenance
that we have to do that.

00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:02.595
And I have to say
that, part of flexing

00:46:02.595 --> 00:46:05.050
and part of understanding
our own biases

00:46:05.050 --> 00:46:07.580
and understanding how to
work across differences

00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:12.480
might have these initial
skills, these initial actions

00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:14.930
that you have to take that
are a little uncomfortable.

00:46:14.930 --> 00:46:16.620
They might feel
like handholding.

00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:20.580
But as you coach and as you
mentor these people to do that,

00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:22.580
obviously they're going
to get more comfortable

00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:23.800
in those situations.

00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:26.710
You're actually opening
the door and recognizing

00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:28.816
where that plays so
that you can flex.

00:46:28.816 --> 00:46:30.700
But if you're the
hierarchical employee,

00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:33.410
there's opportunities for
you to flex, too, I think.

00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:36.770
For you to really go
through your own process

00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:38.630
of looking what's
beneath the surface,

00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:41.620
and thinking about what
values do you really have that

00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:44.470
are driving those
certain behaviors.

00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:47.190
If humility is important
to you, if hierarchy

00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:50.770
is important to you,
what does that mean?

00:46:50.770 --> 00:46:52.410
Respect for authority?

00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:54.210
Does that mean you
can't talk to your boss

00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:57.930
in a way that is
questioning or offering

00:46:57.930 --> 00:47:00.820
information about yourself
or your accomplishments?

00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:02.720
What does that mean to
you to have respect,

00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:05.410
and how do you redefine
or recalibrate that

00:47:05.410 --> 00:47:07.020
in the environment
that you're in?

00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:09.455
So that's one way that you
can flex across the power gap

00:47:09.455 --> 00:47:11.080
and to take that
initiative to do that.

00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:13.070
And it might be
uncomfortable at first,

00:47:13.070 --> 00:47:16.500
but this is where I think
the conversation starts of,

00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:19.680
when you're flexing, what
does that look like for you,

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:21.580
and where do you practice it.

00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:24.840
And I think you can all go
back to your desks after this

00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:28.910
and just make a list of people
that are around you every day--

00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:31.700
your boss, your teammates,
maybe people who

00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:35.130
report to you, people
within your group-- and say,

00:47:35.130 --> 00:47:38.580
what are my power
gap preferences?

00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:39.340
Am I egalitarian?

00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:41.370
Am I more hierarchical?

00:47:41.370 --> 00:47:46.500
Actually personally, I'm more
hierarchical with my superiors,

00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:50.190
but with people that I work with
and people who report to me,

00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:52.010
I'm much more egalitarian.

00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:55.260
So just to know
your own preferences

00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:58.090
with how you work with
people, and that awareness,

00:47:58.090 --> 00:48:00.920
and then knowing other
people's preferences, too.

00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:03.940
And to start flexing
in that way becomes

00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:06.530
something really important.

00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:13.560
I'm just going to cover
one more dimension.

00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:16.810
And this is about communication.

00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:20.180
So direct and indirect style.

00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:23.431
Direct styles, say what you
mean and mean what you say.

00:48:23.431 --> 00:48:25.180
And you might even be
thinking-- if you're

00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:28.380
direct-- I hate it when
people beat around the bush.

00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:31.410
So passive aggressive.

00:48:31.410 --> 00:48:34.020
In direct communication
styles-- you

00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:36.240
might relate with this
statement-- people know

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:40.696
what I mean even if I
don't say it explicitly.

00:48:40.696 --> 00:48:42.820
I mean I don't want to come
across as rude or harsh

00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:44.150
to anyone.

00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:45.770
The relationship's
really important,

00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:47.445
and I don't want
to say it that way

00:48:47.445 --> 00:48:49.600
because it might
hurt their feelings.

00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:51.250
So how many people are direct?

00:48:51.250 --> 00:48:53.000
How many people relate
with the first one?

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.160
Yep.

00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:54.700
Direct.

00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:55.720
Totally direct.

00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:58.349
How many people indirect?

00:48:58.349 --> 00:48:59.390
Kind of relate with that?

00:48:59.390 --> 00:49:00.230
OK.

00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:01.720
And you know,
there's a spectrum.

00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:03.220
Just like for the
power gap, there's

00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:05.050
a spectrum you fall in between.

00:49:05.050 --> 00:49:06.410
I'm totally direct.

00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:08.380
Feedback has told me,
my husband has told me.

00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:11.586
Very, very, very,
very, very direct.

00:49:11.586 --> 00:49:12.835
He's actually pretty indirect.

00:49:12.835 --> 00:49:14.570
So sometimes I'm just like,
just say it, just say it.

00:49:14.570 --> 00:49:15.140
Say it.

00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:17.007
Say it.

00:49:17.007 --> 00:49:17.840
Ask me to marry you.

00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:20.180
Say it.

00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:22.540
But direct styles--
it's interesting.

00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:25.210
For those direct
communicators, what

00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:28.376
do you think about
indirect communicators?

00:49:28.376 --> 00:49:29.741
AUDIENCE: Drives me crazy.

00:49:29.741 --> 00:49:30.866
AUDREY S. LEE: What's that?

00:49:30.866 --> 00:49:32.080
AUDIENCE: Probably
drive me a little crazy.

00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:33.020
AUDREY S. LEE: Drives
you a little crazy?

00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:34.100
Yeah.

00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:34.790
Why?

00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:36.540
AUDIENCE: It's just
not [INAUDIBLE] style.

00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:37.998
AUDREY S. LEE: It's
not your style.

00:49:37.998 --> 00:49:38.820
Right.

00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:40.810
What are your impressions-- if
you're a direct communicator,

00:49:40.810 --> 00:49:43.061
what are your impressions
of an indirect communicator?

00:49:43.061 --> 00:49:43.560
Yeah.

00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:45.270
AUDIENCE: They're
unsure of themselves.

00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:47.103
AUDREY S. LEE: They're
unsure of themselves,

00:49:47.103 --> 00:49:49.300
right, because why
else can't they say it.

00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:50.270
Right?

00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:50.770
Yeah.

00:49:50.770 --> 00:49:52.603
AUDIENCE: It also seems
like it's more work.

00:49:52.603 --> 00:49:54.060
AUDREY S. LEE:
It's so much work.

00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:55.442
It's so much work.

00:49:55.442 --> 00:49:56.400
We can talk afterwards.

00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:59.450
It's so much work.

00:49:59.450 --> 00:50:04.670
Here's the danger of this kind
of assessing and judgments.

00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:07.410
Being a direct communicator,
my first thought

00:50:07.410 --> 00:50:10.970
is, I'm just honest.

00:50:10.970 --> 00:50:12.790
I tell the truth.

00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:15.050
And the implication is what?

00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:17.346
Indirect communicators
aren't really honest.

00:50:17.346 --> 00:50:18.720
They don't really
tell the truth.

00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:21.410
That's a pretty dangerous
assessment, I think.

00:50:21.410 --> 00:50:26.370
So when I'm thinking this, in
my work in fluent leadership,

00:50:26.370 --> 00:50:28.740
in flexing, I have to
catch myself at that moment

00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:31.660
and say, don't think that way.

00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:33.665
I have to challenge
my assumption

00:50:33.665 --> 00:50:37.914
of that truthful,
honest equals to direct.

00:50:37.914 --> 00:50:39.330
What about indirect
communicators?

00:50:39.330 --> 00:50:41.850
What do you think about when
you encounter someone like me?

00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:43.308
Someone like a
direct communicator.

00:50:43.308 --> 00:50:44.201
What do you think?

00:50:44.201 --> 00:50:45.885
AUDIENCE: They think
that you are rude.

00:50:45.885 --> 00:50:47.530
AUDREY S. LEE: I'm so rude.

00:50:47.530 --> 00:50:48.032
So rude.

00:50:48.032 --> 00:50:49.990
I'm from New York, so I
have sort of an excuse,

00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:51.040
but you know.

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:53.804
I'm so rude.

00:50:53.804 --> 00:50:54.970
You don't care about people.

00:50:54.970 --> 00:50:57.320
I hear that a lot, too.

00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:59.200
You're not political.

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:01.780
You don't really know how
to navigate with grace.

00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:03.480
You're too blunt.

00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:05.760
Too-- I hear too honest, too.

00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:07.410
You're just too honest.

00:51:07.410 --> 00:51:09.670
So you start to
see how these gaps,

00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:11.860
and if you have
people on extremes,

00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:18.630
start to really generate
conflict and misunderstanding.

00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:20.170
And if you are
indirect [INAUDIBLE],

00:51:20.170 --> 00:51:21.380
how do you navigate this?

00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:23.610
I think this is a particularly
interesting dimension,

00:51:23.610 --> 00:51:27.470
because if you master indirect
and direct, the spectrum

00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:29.640
of this-- if you know how
to communicate directly

00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:31.490
and you know how to
communicate indirectly,

00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:33.330
you can flex anywhere.

00:51:33.330 --> 00:51:36.990
And mitigating a message is
just an art in and of itself.

00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:39.840
So if you tend to
communicate very directly--

00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:41.020
do this on Friday.

00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:42.700
I need this on Friday.

00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:45.770
You might learn how to mitigate
by asking questions, inviting

00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:49.440
people into the conversation,
changing your tone of voice.

00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:51.130
Instead of saying,
do this by Friday.

00:51:51.130 --> 00:51:53.100
It's like, could you
do this by Friday.

00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:54.440
The use of conditional.

00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:55.110
If.

00:51:55.110 --> 00:51:55.610
Could.

00:51:55.610 --> 00:51:56.170
Would.

00:51:56.170 --> 00:51:58.190
Possibly.

00:51:58.190 --> 00:52:01.160
If you had time, would
you do this by Friday.

00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:02.430
It invites people in.

00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:03.654
Mitigating it.

00:52:03.654 --> 00:52:05.070
If you're an
indirect communicator

00:52:05.070 --> 00:52:07.966
and you find maybe people
don't really know what I mean

00:52:07.966 --> 00:52:10.090
or it takes too long for
me to get my point across,

00:52:10.090 --> 00:52:12.000
how do you become more direct?

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.610
Addressing the
issue specifically.

00:52:14.610 --> 00:52:15.740
Talking directly to people.

00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:19.670
Sometimes indirect communicators
use third parties to talk.

00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:22.369
There's indirect ways
of communicating.

00:52:22.369 --> 00:52:24.660
Back in my day, it was leaving
a voicemail at 3 o'clock

00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:25.284
in the morning.

00:52:25.284 --> 00:52:27.280
It was super indirect, right?

00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:29.900
I don't know, now
everything is direct

00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:33.830
because everyone is
always communicating.

00:52:33.830 --> 00:52:36.640
Also for a lot of--
I hear this a lot

00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:39.160
with women and other
minority groups.

00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:40.170
The word sorry.

00:52:40.170 --> 00:52:41.475
Apologizing.

00:52:41.475 --> 00:52:44.154
It mitigates things,
but if you tend

00:52:44.154 --> 00:52:45.820
to be an indirect
communicator or people

00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:47.820
have that impression
about you, make

00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:49.540
sure you watch the
way you apologize.

00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:53.320
Because what does
saying I'm sorry mean?

00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:54.342
What can it mean to you?

00:52:54.342 --> 00:52:56.008
AUDIENCE: That you
will not do it again.

00:52:56.008 --> 00:52:57.757
AUDREY S. LEE: That
you won't do it again.

00:52:57.757 --> 00:52:59.100
It's your fault.

00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:00.750
You did something wrong, right?

00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:02.730
But sometimes I'm
sorry just means,

00:53:02.730 --> 00:53:04.320
I'm sorry you feel that way.

00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:07.090
Or that's maybe a terrible
thing and I'm-- empathy.

00:53:07.090 --> 00:53:08.540
Right.

00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:10.540
But for a lot of women
and a lot of minorities

00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:14.010
who say I'm sorry, people hear
that the wrong way, and it

00:53:14.010 --> 00:53:16.810
mitigates it in a way that
the message doesn't become

00:53:16.810 --> 00:53:20.020
as strong as you need it to
be when you're making impact.

00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:22.890
So really looking
at this dimension,

00:53:22.890 --> 00:53:25.930
how you can flex across if
you're whatever preference it

00:53:25.930 --> 00:53:28.239
is to the other side
and mastering that,

00:53:28.239 --> 00:53:29.780
is going to become
a really great way

00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:33.590
to understand the different
styles and how it plays out.

00:53:33.590 --> 00:53:35.290
The different
perceptions that happen

00:53:35.290 --> 00:53:38.820
at either extreme in
different situations.

00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:40.770
So I really want to hear
some of the questions

00:53:40.770 --> 00:53:42.870
that you might
have, so I'm going

00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:45.000
to pass through
these dimensions.

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:48.454
But I want to say that
they are in the book,

00:53:48.454 --> 00:53:49.620
they're covered in the book.

00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:52.890
I talk about individualistic
and collectivistic cultures

00:53:52.890 --> 00:53:54.920
and style preferences,
as well as

00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:58.650
expressive, restrained,
task-oriented and

00:53:58.650 --> 00:54:01.920
relationship-oriented
preferences, and some others.

00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:07.982
But I want to say for people who
are in the minority population

00:54:07.982 --> 00:54:10.440
or find themselves a little
bit different than the dominant

00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:16.260
culture, there is a message
for us to really understand

00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:19.330
our narrative, as I said,
and understand your values.

00:54:19.330 --> 00:54:21.380
Understand what
you have to offer

00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:23.790
and how that translates
to the results,

00:54:23.790 --> 00:54:26.176
and what you're doing
in the organization.

00:54:26.176 --> 00:54:27.550
Knowing your
context and how that

00:54:27.550 --> 00:54:30.170
differs from your own
values and your behaviors.

00:54:30.170 --> 00:54:33.380
Those unwritten
rules of the game

00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:36.110
may be at odds with
how you were raised.

00:54:36.110 --> 00:54:40.140
So the behavior that you
need to be exhibiting

00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:43.270
may be at odds with how
you're used to behaving.

00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:45.000
Think about that.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.870
Be visible and be heard
in the organization.

00:54:47.870 --> 00:54:50.330
That develops influence, and
it's really important for you

00:54:50.330 --> 00:54:51.170
to do that.

00:54:51.170 --> 00:54:53.830
But do it in your own style.

00:54:53.830 --> 00:54:56.750
If you go out there,
how are you going

00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:59.260
to become visible and be heard?

00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:02.620
With your own story, with your
own work, with the own value.

00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:05.630
And I know I was just
talking about [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:05.630 --> 00:55:10.780
The value of you as a group,
of this ERG as a group, what

00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:12.740
is the value to Google?

00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:14.780
Be visible and be heard.

00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:16.860
Initiate that
dialogue that allows

00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:19.880
flexing, that closes
the power gap.

00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:22.750
And sometimes it gets
a little tiring, right,

00:55:22.750 --> 00:55:25.140
if you're in a minority
group and you're thinking,

00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:26.977
I'm always the one
flexing anyway.

00:55:26.977 --> 00:55:28.310
I'm always the one reaching out.

00:55:28.310 --> 00:55:30.300
Why don't people
reach out to me?

00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:33.530
If we think of
ourselves as leaders--

00:55:33.530 --> 00:55:35.880
and we need to start thinking
of ourselves as leaders--

00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:38.060
the leaders have to
take that initiative.

00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:40.160
Because I can't tell
you how uncomfortable

00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:42.920
this conversation
is for everybody,

00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:44.650
talking about differences.

00:55:44.650 --> 00:55:47.366
Nobody's going to initiate--
it's very rare that someone

00:55:47.366 --> 00:55:49.240
else will initiate the
conversation with you,

00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:51.074
because it's so hard to have.

00:55:51.074 --> 00:55:52.490
What are they going
to say to you?

00:55:52.490 --> 00:55:55.620
They may not even know.

00:55:55.620 --> 00:55:57.940
Build mentor and
sponsor relationships.

00:55:57.940 --> 00:56:00.614
This is really important,
that once you--

00:56:00.614 --> 00:56:02.030
when you know your
narrative, when

00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:05.590
you know your value, when
you understand your story,

00:56:05.590 --> 00:56:08.530
you can start building
these relationships

00:56:08.530 --> 00:56:10.050
in a very organic way.

00:56:10.050 --> 00:56:12.630
And that's important because
you need the sponsors

00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:15.340
and you need the
mentors who advise you

00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:17.540
and who also influence
on your behalf,

00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:21.080
advocate for you on your behalf
when you go for those stretch

00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:23.390
assignments and those
promotions and you're

00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:25.027
advancing in the organization.

00:56:25.027 --> 00:56:25.610
You need that.

00:56:25.610 --> 00:56:28.920
And you can't just make these
relationships overnight.

00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:31.170
You really have to know how
to communicate and build

00:56:31.170 --> 00:56:32.480
those relationships.

00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:34.860
For those in the
dominant culture,

00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:36.830
I would say that the
role is really important

00:56:36.830 --> 00:56:38.030
to understand here, too.

00:56:38.030 --> 00:56:40.520
And when I talk to upper
management and other parts

00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:43.100
of the organization, the
role for you to flex,

00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:44.350
it's more important than ever.

00:56:44.350 --> 00:56:48.400
To challenge your unconscious
biases, the judgments that you

00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:51.332
make automatically, those
assumptions that you have.

00:56:51.332 --> 00:56:53.540
You have to learn how to
flex across the differences,

00:56:53.540 --> 00:56:57.100
open the dialogue to people who
seem like they're the other.

00:56:57.100 --> 00:57:00.350
And you have to create a fluent
leader culture around you.

00:57:00.350 --> 00:57:02.950
And that's your opportunity to
multiply that effect, really

00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:07.100
understanding how to create this
culture where you can actually

00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:10.780
integrate peoples and understand
the value of people who

00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:13.229
are different than you and
integrate that into your work

00:57:13.229 --> 00:57:14.020
and into your team.

00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:16.970
So that really
requires for you to be

00:57:16.970 --> 00:57:19.950
curious to understand what
is beneath the surface,

00:57:19.950 --> 00:57:22.514
and to become a fluent leader.

00:57:22.514 --> 00:57:24.180
I just want to end
with saying that that

00:57:24.180 --> 00:57:26.550
is our opportunity
and our challenge,

00:57:26.550 --> 00:57:29.830
to grow the fluent leader
culture here at Google

00:57:29.830 --> 00:57:32.150
and to actually make
that second nature.

00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:34.400
And it's really hard
to do, but there's so

00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:38.110
many ways that we can start
identifying those gaps

00:57:38.110 --> 00:57:41.850
and how we can start
flexing across differences.

00:57:41.850 --> 00:57:44.680
Thank you so much for letting
me talk a little bit about that.

00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:47.320
I'd love to continue the
conversation with you.

00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:49.080
You can follow me on Twitter.

00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:52.641
I have a hashtag #CeilingStories
that I'm starting.

00:57:52.641 --> 00:57:54.390
I would actually love
to hear a little bit

00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:58.230
about your experiences
as hopefully we

00:57:58.230 --> 00:57:59.780
continue this discussion.

00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:01.480
Barriers that you might see.

00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:05.890
How you engage with the team
and the organization around you.

00:58:05.890 --> 00:58:08.520
And some challenges
that you might see,

00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:11.760
and how you've gotten over them
or if they still exist for you.

00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:14.510
So I'd love to continue that
conversation with you, too,

00:58:14.510 --> 00:58:15.350
beyond just today.

00:58:15.350 --> 00:58:16.550
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank
you so much, Audrey.

00:58:16.550 --> 00:58:17.591
AUDREY S. LEE: Thank you.

00:58:17.591 --> 00:58:20.200
[APPLAUSE]
