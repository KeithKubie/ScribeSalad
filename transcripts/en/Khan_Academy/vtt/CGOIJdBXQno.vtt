00:00:12.288 --> 00:00:13.479
So even when I read that

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.810
what felt really awkward

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:17.459
was saying wise or exceptional lucky

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:19.799
this exceptional felt really strange

00:00:19.799 --> 00:00:23.635
because it's trying to modify the lucky

00:00:23.635 --> 00:00:26.119
it's trying to tell us what type of lucky we were

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:27.809
we were not exceptional lucky

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:28.467
this is an adverb

00:00:28.467 --> 00:00:29.427
an adverb

00:00:29.427 --> 00:00:30.295
it should say

00:00:30.295 --> 00:00:32.255
we were EXCEPTIONALLY

00:00:32.255 --> 00:00:34.945
EXCEPTIONALLY lucky

00:00:34.945 --> 00:00:37.515
so the error right over here is in D

00:00:37.515 --> 00:00:39.005
We don't need just an adjective

00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:40.485
We need an adverb

00:00:40.485 --> 00:00:43.485
We are modifying another adjective

00:00:43.485 --> 00:00:44.525
We are modifying lucky

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.630
What type of lucky we were?

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.000
We were EXCEPTIONALLY lucky

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So the error is in part D
