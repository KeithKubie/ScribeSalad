00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.400
Almost everyday

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.040
with slightly dispiriting inevitability,

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.080
someone in our vicinity will hurt us in some way.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.440
It could be a friend,

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.200
a colleague,

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.720
a child or, most likely,

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.160
a partner.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.000
They'll be neglectful of something that matters

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.340
immensely to us.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.960
They'll be, to a greater or lesser extent,

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.480
unkind, thoughtless, offensive or brusk.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.160
We may never have given much thought to observing the way

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.920
we characteristically respond.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.940
And yet, our style of reacting to maltreatment

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.460
goes right to the heart of who we are

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.980
and can make the difference between:

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.720
A life of constant frustration and bitterness

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.520
and one of tolerable coexistence.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.680
A crucial part of the art of living

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.460
seems to lie in knowing how to

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.560
complain constructively and sanely to

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.040
those who do us wrong.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.520
There are broadly 3 main ways in which one might complain.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.440
The first is live fury.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.760
Here, we explode, shout, insult, belittle and

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.380
attempted to crush our opponent.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.960
What lies behind this response is it hard panic and agitation

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.320
and a catastrophic feeling of hurt and betrayal.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.080
The slights to our dignity cuts us so deep,

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.860
unsettled us so much,

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.120
we attempt to ROAR our way out of humiliation.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.880
Our bark may be loud but it

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.060
comes from a place of extreme vulnerability.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.060
We're living without a psychological skin.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.400
Unfortunately, of course,

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.040
live fury is guaranteed to

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.840
prevent our complaint from ever being heard.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.400
In the face of our ranting,

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.880
those who've offended us, will themselves get offended,

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.180
begin to resent us,

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.100
refuse to listen and accuse us of a raft of things,

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.600
which entirely bury our original

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.560
complaint against them.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.420
We achieve nothing.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.640
There is a second option:

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.380
Cold fury.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.170
Here one says very little but

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.840
hates very deeply and quietly.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.500
We don't dare to complain directly from a despair

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.600
that the other would ever understand.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.960
Fuelled with a feeling that we don't

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.880
deserve ever to be listened to.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.549
A primitive self-hatred encases us in

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.440
cynicism and melancholy.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.020
We become experts at withdrawal.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.500
We've probably been like this from a young age.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.420
The adults we grew up around were probably

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.849
too touchy, busy, domineering or absent to

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.260
give us much of a hearing.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.340
So we learn to swallow our pain and while seething inside,

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.500
act with brittle courtesy and veiled aggression against those hated

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.780
characters who've done us wrong.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.560
Then comes that far rarer achievement:

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.460
Mature complaint.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.400
In order to master such a feat,

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.560
we must work with a background sense that

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.000
we don't fundamentally deserve meanness

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.060
and also that it won't on its own ever

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.880
be able to destroy us.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.599
We are calm because we like ourselves well enough,

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.980
a legacy of being cared for by people who

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.180
liked us and refuse to endure

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.580
punishment quietly or with masochistic patience.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.080
We have the confidence not to

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.360
be thrown into complete disarray by insult.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.140
We can seek restitution and

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.580
tend to do so fairly fast while the incident

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.800
is still fresh in everyone's mind

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.620
but with a measured, strategic, calm manner

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.440
of people secure in their right to have their say.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.040
We're careful not to insult or

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.420
belittle our opponents.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.860
We always simply say: How we feel.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.620
Rather than declaring: You're vindictive and selfish for doing X;

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.580
We say: I feel hurt :( by the way you do X.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.540
We don't give others easy excuses to get

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.440
insulted and block their ears in turn.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.860
We don't want to make it that simple for them.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.269
Nevertheless we don't have

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.250
unlimited faith that people are always

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.410
going to understand and accept what

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.580
we're trying to tell them,

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.060
yet we want to speak out anyway.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.400
Because we know it's not good for us to swallow our

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.060
complaints and we don't want ulcers.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.420
We are at once realistic about the chances of

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.240
dialogue and determine to talk in any case.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.910
We deserve a huge amount of

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.130
compassion for our failure to know how

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.860
to complain wisely.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.400
Our inability is a snapshot into our past and into some

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.540
properly troublesome dynamics that occurred long ago.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.060
But by sketching the ideal style of complaining,

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.420
we can start to imagine what we're not natively capable of

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.460
and to fill in through reason and reflection

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:18.400
what we haven't been able to achieve

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.600
through upbringing and love.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.900
We can take our first stumbling steps

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:23.920
on the path

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.660
to mature compliant.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.600
you
