00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.676
Where were we last time?
Last time we had discovered

00:00:12.676 --> 00:00:16.895
that radiation,
and we're going back to Lecture

00:00:16.895 --> 00:00:22.489
4 notes, because I think I have
a little bit left on Lecture 4

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:27.441
notes, we discovered that
radiation also behaves like a

00:00:27.441 --> 00:00:31.648
particle.
And it behaves like a particle,

00:00:31.648 --> 00:00:35.152
as exhibited in this
photoelectric effect.

00:00:35.152 --> 00:00:38.570
That is, in order to get an
electron out,

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.270
what we needed to do was to put
in a particle of energy.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.517
We needed to put in a packet of
energy.

00:00:46.517 --> 00:00:49.849
We needed to put in a quantum
of energy.

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:54.976
And as long as that quantum of
energy, that packet of energy,

00:00:54.976 --> 00:00:59.847
that particle of energy was
larger than the work function,

00:00:59.847 --> 00:01:06.000
we would get one electron out
for every packet we put in.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.649
That's an example of the
particle-like nature to

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:15.975
radiation, this photoelectric
effect.

00:01:15.975 --> 00:01:22.706
But Einstein also went on to
show an even more convincing

00:01:22.706 --> 00:01:28.596
property of the particle-like
nature of radiation,

00:01:28.596 --> 00:01:34.456
or a photon.
And that is he showed that a

00:01:34.456 --> 00:01:40.506
photon has momentum,
even though a photon does not

00:01:40.506 --> 00:01:45.197
have mass, or essentially no
rest mass.

00:01:45.197 --> 00:01:49.271
And, of course,
momentum is a very

00:01:49.271 --> 00:01:54.086
particle-like property.
p, for momentum,

00:01:54.086 --> 00:01:58.407
is equal to the mass times
velocity.

00:01:58.407 --> 00:02:02.647
If a particle,

00:02:02.647 --> 00:02:07.117
if a photon,
if radiation has momentum,

00:02:07.117 --> 00:02:12.058
then it's acting very much like
a particle.

00:02:12.058 --> 00:02:17.000
How did he do this?
Well, Einstein took the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.470
relativistic equations of
motion, which he himself wrote

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.705
down.
And what he showed from that is

00:02:27.705 --> 00:02:33.000
that a photon had momentum p
here.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.524
And the momentum of the photon
is defined by the frequency of

00:02:38.524 --> 00:02:42.207
the radiation.
That is, that momentum was

00:02:42.207 --> 00:02:45.982
given by h, again Planck's
constant there,

00:02:45.982 --> 00:02:51.046
that quantization constant,
times the frequency over the

00:02:51.046 --> 00:02:54.360
speed of light.
And since, of course,

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.240
we know the relationship
between the frequency and the

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.580
wavelength, we can write the
momentum of a photon as h over

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.000
lambda.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.085
So, if you have radiation of
some wavelength lambda,

00:03:15.085 --> 00:03:18.545
that radiation,
those photons,

00:03:18.545 --> 00:03:24.988
have this momentum h over
lambda, this photon momentum,

00:03:24.988 --> 00:03:30.000
even though photons don't have
mass.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.545
And the actual demonstration of
this experimentally took a few

00:03:35.545 --> 00:03:39.181
more years.
And it was demonstrated first

00:03:39.181 --> 00:03:43.909
in something called the Compton
Effect, which was the

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:48.181
interaction of an X-ray photon
with some matter.

00:03:48.181 --> 00:03:51.727
And you could see it,
transfer momentum.

00:03:51.727 --> 00:03:57.272
And I've got to show you here
this website from the University

00:03:57.272 --> 00:04:02.345
of Colorado again.
And this is just a video of a

00:04:02.345 --> 00:04:05.094
photon gun, here,
shooting photons.

00:04:05.094 --> 00:04:08.409
And here is this enemy atom
coming at you.

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:11.078
And you're shooting these
photons.

00:04:11.078 --> 00:04:14.636
And, sure enough,
you can repel that atom and

00:04:14.636 --> 00:04:19.487
make it go the other direction
because of the momentum of the

00:04:19.487 --> 00:04:21.185
photon.
But of course,

00:04:21.185 --> 00:04:25.876
if you lower the power and
you're not really good with your

00:04:25.876 --> 00:04:30.000
fingers here,
you can get clobbered.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.343
Here now I am going to try this
again.

00:04:33.343 --> 00:04:38.132
This is almost too easy.
Now I lower the power so that

00:04:38.132 --> 00:04:43.554
the rate of the photons are much
slower, and I am going to be

00:04:43.554 --> 00:04:47.168
able to turn this guy around.
No problem.

00:04:47.168 --> 00:04:50.240
There we go.
Repelled it right off.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.933
So it really is the case that--
Let me see if I can get this guy

00:04:55.933 --> 00:05:00.000
here, I got clobbered.
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.346
Well, you'll be better at that
game than I am.

00:05:04.346 --> 00:05:09.852
It is just that phenomena.
What I am showing you here that

00:05:09.852 --> 00:05:14.198
led to the experimental feat of
atom trapping,

00:05:14.198 --> 00:05:18.642
trapping an atom in space.
How do they do that?

00:05:18.642 --> 00:05:24.244
Well, what they did is they
took some unsuspecting atom and

00:05:24.244 --> 00:05:28.494
they came in with some photons,
a laser beam,

00:05:28.494 --> 00:05:34.000
a high power laser beam
directed in this way.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.565
And, of course,
that pushed this atom down.

00:05:36.565 --> 00:05:39.619
But now, if you come in with
the laser beam in that

00:05:39.619 --> 00:05:42.918
direction, all the photon
momentum is going to push the

00:05:42.918 --> 00:05:45.667
atom up so now you have
constrained it in this

00:05:45.667 --> 00:05:48.171
dimension.
And you send another laser beam

00:05:48.171 --> 00:05:51.837
this way and another one this
way, and now you've constrained

00:05:51.837 --> 00:05:54.769
it in this dimension.
And then you send the laser

00:05:54.769 --> 00:05:58.434
beam in this way and a laser
beam in that way and constrained

00:05:58.434 --> 00:06:04.610
it in the third dimension.
You've trapped an atom in space

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:10.433
via photon momentum.
And this is what Steve Chu and

00:06:10.433 --> 00:06:17.538
Stanford and Bill Phillips at
NIST did in the middle 1990s and

00:06:17.538 --> 00:06:22.895
received a Nobel Prize for,
this atom trapping,

00:06:22.895 --> 00:06:25.574
here, in 1977.
No, 1997.

00:06:25.574 --> 00:06:30.000
Sorry.
Photons have momentum.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.702
And the reason this is so
important, the reason this

00:06:35.702 --> 00:06:42.747
experiment was also so important
is because it is the first step

00:06:42.747 --> 00:06:47.108
in producing a Bose-Einstein
condensate.

00:06:47.108 --> 00:06:52.923
A Bose-Einstein condensate is
where you take an atom,

00:06:52.923 --> 00:06:58.178
which is a boson,
actually, and you cool it down

00:06:58.178 --> 00:07:05.000
to such low temperatures that
these atoms condense.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.486
So, you've got to cool it down
very much so.

00:07:08.486 --> 00:07:11.810
You have to get to the micro
Kelvin range.

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:16.189
And the first step in cooling
an atom down is this atom

00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:18.945
trapping, this laser atom
trapping.

00:07:18.945 --> 00:07:23.486
This will get you down to
Kelvin or a little bit lower or

00:07:23.486 --> 00:07:24.945
so.
And, of course,

00:07:24.945 --> 00:07:29.648
what I mean by lowering the
temperature is that I've slowed

00:07:29.648 --> 00:07:34.212
this atom down.
The temperature of the gas

00:07:34.212 --> 00:07:37.531
related to how fast this atom is
moving.

00:07:37.531 --> 00:07:40.851
If I slow it down,
I am cooling the gas.

00:07:40.851 --> 00:07:45.957
This here is that first step in
getting the atom to condense.

00:07:45.957 --> 00:07:49.617
It's the first step in cooling
the gas down.

00:07:49.617 --> 00:07:52.255
Then there are many other
steps.

00:07:52.255 --> 00:07:55.234
And, actually,
the boson condensate,

00:07:55.234 --> 00:08:00.085
one of the individuals who
accomplished that feat is right

00:08:00.085 --> 00:08:05.784
here in the Physics Department.
One of my colleagues,

00:08:05.784 --> 00:08:09.692
Wolfgang Ketterle.
Many of you will get to meet

00:08:09.692 --> 00:08:13.346
Wolfgang Ketterle.
In fact, he might even be

00:08:13.346 --> 00:08:16.830
teaching a section of 8.01.
Is that right?

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.869
Pardon.
Recitation, okay.

00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:21.673
Great.
Maybe he will tell you some

00:08:21.673 --> 00:08:24.647
more about it,
if he hasn't already.

00:08:24.647 --> 00:08:30.000
So, photons have momentum.
Now, what have we seen?

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.819
Well, what we have seen is that
radiation exhibits both the

00:08:34.819 --> 00:08:38.975
wave-like behavior and this
particle-like behavior.

00:08:38.975 --> 00:08:43.296
And, just in general,
experiments where the radiation

00:08:43.296 --> 00:08:48.116
produces a change in matter,
like the photoelectric effect,

00:08:48.116 --> 00:08:50.775
that's a change in matter,
right?

00:08:50.775 --> 00:08:54.349
An electron gets ripped off of
the material.

00:08:54.349 --> 00:09:00.000
Experiments in which a change
in the matter is effected.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.972
In that case,
usually the radiation exhibits

00:09:03.972 --> 00:09:08.315
particle-like behavior,
experiments in which the

00:09:08.315 --> 00:09:13.396
radiation interaction results in
a change in the spatial

00:09:13.396 --> 00:09:18.293
distribution of the radiation.
Well, in that case then

00:09:18.293 --> 00:09:22.081
radiation exhibits its wave-like
behavior.

00:09:22.081 --> 00:09:27.347
And so it's not really a proper
question or an appropriate

00:09:27.347 --> 00:09:34.000
question to ask whether light is
a particle or is it a wave.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.528
The appropriate question is to
ask whether light behaves like a

00:09:39.528 --> 00:09:44.789
particle or behaves like a wave,
depending on the particular

00:09:44.789 --> 00:09:49.694
experimental conditions.
Now, this kind of wave-particle

00:09:49.694 --> 00:09:55.401
duality, or the ability of it to
behave like a wave or a particle

00:09:55.401 --> 00:09:59.681
is not a contradiction.
It's just the fundamental

00:09:59.681 --> 00:10:03.703
nature of light.
It might seem like a

00:10:03.703 --> 00:10:08.813
contradiction to you because
your everyday experience doesn't

00:10:08.813 --> 00:10:13.072
allow you to see that both
properties can be there.

00:10:13.072 --> 00:10:18.182
Your everyday experience says
it's a particle or it's a wave,

00:10:18.182 --> 00:10:22.952
but this is a part of nature,
of our world that you don't

00:10:22.952 --> 00:10:29.000
have the experience with every
single day so it seems strange.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.761
But it is the way light works.
It's like someone asked me,

00:10:33.761 --> 00:10:38.689
what is the form of a photon?
And when you ask that question

00:10:38.689 --> 00:10:43.366
that's fine, but you have to
realize what you want for an

00:10:43.366 --> 00:10:48.378
answer is to draw an analogy
between that photon in something

00:10:48.378 --> 00:10:51.051
that you can experience
everyday.

00:10:51.051 --> 00:10:55.227
And the bottom line is you
cannot draw that analogy

00:10:55.227 --> 00:11:00.071
correctly because that photon is
not something that you can

00:11:00.071 --> 00:11:05.000
relate correctly to your
everyday experience.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.672
It's a different part of
nature.

00:11:07.672 --> 00:11:11.293
It's just one that you don't
see every day,

00:11:11.293 --> 00:11:15.172
so it seems strange.
You have to be willing to

00:11:15.172 --> 00:11:19.655
accept kind of new rules,
new phenomena that are just

00:11:19.655 --> 00:11:22.672
outside of your everyday
experience.

00:11:22.672 --> 00:11:26.724
They're out there.
As you delve into nature more

00:11:26.724 --> 00:11:32.485
deeply, you will see that.
Okay, so we've taken care of

00:11:32.485 --> 00:11:37.455
radiation, the wave-particle
duality of light and matter.

00:11:37.455 --> 00:11:42.603
Now what we've got to do is
we've got to talk about matter,

00:11:42.603 --> 00:11:47.928
and we've got to talk about its
wave-like properties and also

00:11:47.928 --> 00:11:52.544
its particle-like properties.
Well, its particle-like

00:11:52.544 --> 00:11:57.248
properties are certainly
something that is within your

00:11:57.248 --> 00:12:03.050
everyday experience.
You can understand matter as a

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:06.406
particle.
What's more difficult to

00:12:06.406 --> 00:12:10.576
understand is matter behaving
like a wave.

00:12:10.576 --> 00:12:14.644
For example,
if you had a situation where

00:12:14.644 --> 00:12:18.711
you have the surface of a nickel
crystal.

00:12:18.711 --> 00:12:24.508
And what I am showing you right
here are two nickel atoms,

00:12:24.508 --> 00:12:30.000
just two nickel atoms of this
surface here.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.012
And the two nickel atoms are
spaced about 2x10^-10 meters

00:12:35.012 --> 00:12:39.129
from each other,
given the lattice spacing of a

00:12:39.129 --> 00:12:42.978
nickel crystal.
And now if I went and I sent

00:12:42.978 --> 00:12:46.648
electrons into this nickel
surface, again,

00:12:46.648 --> 00:12:49.959
I'm just showing you two of the
atoms.

00:12:49.959 --> 00:12:55.240
If I came in with electrons,
electrons are particles because

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:55.598
J.
J.

00:12:55.598 --> 00:13:00.986
Thompson showed us that.
Eventually the mass of those

00:13:00.986 --> 00:13:04.745
electrons was determined.
But what you might expect is

00:13:04.745 --> 00:13:09.215
that those electrons would come
in and then backscatter from the

00:13:09.215 --> 00:13:13.329
surface atoms and do so in all
directions so that out here,

00:13:13.329 --> 00:13:16.947
where we have a phosphor
screen, and now that screen

00:13:16.947 --> 00:13:21.203
happens to be curved just so it
will be easier for us to talk

00:13:21.203 --> 00:13:23.970
about the geometry of this
problem here,

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:28.155
you might expect naively that
these electrons scatter in all

00:13:28.155 --> 00:13:32.456
directions.
And everywhere where they hit

00:13:32.456 --> 00:13:35.166
the screen, the screen lights
up.

00:13:35.166 --> 00:13:39.401
Well, this is just the
experiment that Davidson and

00:13:39.401 --> 00:13:42.112
Germer did in 1927,
along with G.

00:13:42.112 --> 00:13:45.669
Thompson, George Thompson,
so the son of J.

00:13:45.669 --> 00:13:46.601
J.
Thompson.

00:13:46.601 --> 00:13:50.158
Actually, G.
Thompson did the experiment in

00:13:50.158 --> 00:13:54.139
a little different way than
Davidson and Germer.

00:13:54.139 --> 00:13:59.136
And I am going to explain the
Davidson and Germer experiment

00:13:59.136 --> 00:14:03.410
here.
And now what I've done is I've

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:07.267
taken my nickel atoms and just
made them smaller,

00:14:07.267 --> 00:14:12.089
and I did so because I need to
clean up this diagram a little

00:14:12.089 --> 00:14:17.151
bit for the geometry that we're
going to do, but I have left the

00:14:17.151 --> 00:14:21.812
lattice spacing accurate here.
And what Davidson and Germer

00:14:21.812 --> 00:14:26.714
did was to bring in an electron
beam at 54 electron volts.

00:14:26.714 --> 00:14:30.447
And they looked to see how

00:14:30.447 --> 00:14:35.811
these electrons scattered back
from that surface onto that

00:14:35.811 --> 00:14:38.164
screen.
And lo and behold,

00:14:38.164 --> 00:14:43.341
what they found was that those
electrons did not scatter

00:14:43.341 --> 00:14:46.729
isotropically.
They did not go in all

00:14:46.729 --> 00:14:52.564
directions, but there seemed to
be a preferred scattering angle

00:14:52.564 --> 00:14:55.576
here.
And one of those scattering

00:14:55.576 --> 00:15:00.000
angles right here is 50.7
degrees.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.202
This angle right in here,
that's the angle from the

00:15:04.202 --> 00:15:09.498
surface normal to the direction
in which this electron scatters.

00:15:09.498 --> 00:15:14.542
They observed some scattered
intensity, lots of electron flux

00:15:14.542 --> 00:15:17.736
at this angle here,
about 50.7 degrees.

00:15:17.736 --> 00:15:22.359
And they observed a lot of
intensity right at the normal

00:15:22.359 --> 00:15:26.310
angle, right here.
So, the electron comes in and

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:30.537
scatters right back.
And, depending on the

00:15:30.537 --> 00:15:34.565
experimental conditions,
they observed some intensity at

00:15:34.565 --> 00:15:37.054
a very large scattering angle
here.

00:15:37.054 --> 00:15:40.789
What does this look like?
It looks like interference

00:15:40.789 --> 00:15:44.084
phenomena, right?
It looks like the results of

00:15:44.084 --> 00:15:46.647
the two-slit experiment that we
did.

00:15:46.647 --> 00:15:50.748
There is a very bright spot,
a very intense spot right in

00:15:50.748 --> 00:15:53.457
the center.
Then there is a dark spot.

00:15:53.457 --> 00:15:55.874
Then there is a very intense
spot.

00:15:55.874 --> 00:16:01.000
Then there is a dark spot.
Then another intense spot.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.456
It looks like interference
phenomena.

00:16:04.456 --> 00:16:09.546
Well, let's see if we can
understand that interference

00:16:09.546 --> 00:16:13.003
phenomena.
Here is that same diagram.

00:16:13.003 --> 00:16:16.172
I just cleaned it up a little
bit.

00:16:16.172 --> 00:16:21.357
What we're doing in the
experiment is we're bringing in

00:16:21.357 --> 00:16:24.430
a continuous stream of
electrons.

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:30.000
And here is my continuous
stream of electrons.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.782
And I am only showing you two
atoms, but the same thing is

00:16:35.782 --> 00:16:41.260
happening on a lot of atoms.
What it looks like is that

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:46.942
these electrons are coming in,
and then each one of these

00:16:46.942 --> 00:16:52.826
atoms are kind of acting like a
point source reflecting the

00:16:52.826 --> 00:16:56.173
electrons isotropically as a
wave.

00:16:56.173 --> 00:17:02.057
That is that there is a wave
that's emanating out from each

00:17:02.057 --> 00:17:06.325
one of the atoms.
And, of course,

00:17:06.325 --> 00:17:11.360
as time goes on that propagates
out, and then another wave

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:14.452
front, another maximum emanates
out.

00:17:14.452 --> 00:17:18.427
And, of course,
the distance between these two

00:17:18.427 --> 00:17:23.992
maxima is the wavelength because
this is the maximum wave front,

00:17:23.992 --> 00:17:27.968
here is another one.
With time it continues to

00:17:27.968 --> 00:17:32.027
emanate out.
With time it continues to

00:17:32.027 --> 00:17:36.567
emanate out, as long as we are
throwing electrons at that

00:17:36.567 --> 00:17:40.297
nickel crystal.
And it continues to emanate out

00:17:40.297 --> 00:17:44.837
until it gets to the screen.
And then we see some bright,

00:17:44.837 --> 00:17:47.432
dark, bright,
dark, bright spots.

00:17:47.432 --> 00:17:50.837
It looks just like the two-slit
experiment.

00:17:50.837 --> 00:17:53.513
And now, if we go to analyze
this.

00:17:53.513 --> 00:17:56.027
Again, this is the same
drawing.

00:17:56.027 --> 00:18:00.000
I just cleaned it up a little
bit.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.066
If you look at this point right
here, what do you see?

00:18:04.066 --> 00:18:08.746
Well, you see the maximum of a
wave scattered from atom one at

00:18:08.746 --> 00:18:13.272
the same point in space as the
maximum of the wave scattered

00:18:13.272 --> 00:18:16.341
from atom two.
Constructive interference.

00:18:16.341 --> 00:18:18.949
Next point here,
again, two maxima,

00:18:18.949 --> 00:18:22.862
the same points in space,
constructive interference.

00:18:22.862 --> 00:18:25.931
Here two maxima,
the same point in space,

00:18:25.931 --> 00:18:31.330
constructive interference.
Everywhere along that line we

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:36.073
have constructive interference.
And so if you project out to

00:18:36.073 --> 00:18:40.172
the screen you're going to have
a bright spot there.

00:18:40.172 --> 00:18:44.914
You're going to have electrons
being scattered right in that

00:18:44.914 --> 00:18:46.683
angle.
And now we know,

00:18:46.683 --> 00:18:50.782
we talked about last time what
the condition was for

00:18:50.782 --> 00:18:54.801
constructive interference.
And the condition is the

00:18:54.801 --> 00:18:59.302
difference in the distance
traveled by the two waves that

00:18:59.302 --> 00:19:05.450
are constructively interfering.
Now I use the letter D instead

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:07.901
of R.
But the difference in the

00:19:07.901 --> 00:19:12.312
distance has to be equal to an
integral multiple of the

00:19:12.312 --> 00:19:15.498
wavelength.
And if you analyze this line

00:19:15.498 --> 00:19:18.194
here of constructive
interference,

00:19:18.194 --> 00:19:23.095
you would find it was N equals;
the difference in

00:19:23.095 --> 00:19:25.873
the distance traveled was 1
lambda.

00:19:25.873 --> 00:19:28.650
And over here,
you can see a row of

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:33.824
constructive interference.
And if you analyze this

00:19:33.824 --> 00:19:38.186
constructive interference,
you would find the difference

00:19:38.186 --> 00:19:41.121
in the distance traveled was 2
lambda.

00:19:41.121 --> 00:19:45.563
This is our second-order
diffraction spot or second-order

00:19:45.563 --> 00:19:48.815
interference feature.
And then, of course,

00:19:48.815 --> 00:19:52.147
we had the zero-order
interference feature.

00:19:52.147 --> 00:19:55.240
These electrons are behaving
like waves.

00:19:55.240 --> 00:20:00.000
It's constructive and
destructive interference.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.778
Now, what we are going to do is
we're going to analyze the

00:20:04.778 --> 00:20:08.131
geometry of this setup a little
bit more.

00:20:08.131 --> 00:20:12.826
We didn't do this for the
two-slit experiment with light.

00:20:12.826 --> 00:20:15.173
We could have,
but we didn't.

00:20:15.173 --> 00:20:19.616
We're going to do it here for
the electron scattering.

00:20:19.616 --> 00:20:24.311
It's really the same thing.
And we're going to do it just

00:20:24.311 --> 00:20:30.215
like Davidson and Germer did it.
Because from this analysis,

00:20:30.215 --> 00:20:34.728
in particular from knowing what
the scattering angle is,

00:20:34.728 --> 00:20:39.158
this is the quantity that
Davidson and Germer wanted to

00:20:39.158 --> 00:20:42.194
measure, or were really
interested in,

00:20:42.194 --> 00:20:47.035
this scattering angle which
turns out to be 50.7 degrees for

00:20:47.035 --> 00:20:49.743
this first-order diffraction
beam.

00:20:49.743 --> 00:20:53.764
We're going to use that
knowledge to calculate the

00:20:53.764 --> 00:20:58.358
wavelength of the electron.
That's what we're aiming for,

00:20:58.358 --> 00:21:02.217
here.
And we're going to do that

00:21:02.217 --> 00:21:07.420
because of this known condition
for constructive interference,

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:12.026
that the difference in the
distance traveled by the two

00:21:12.026 --> 00:21:16.461
waves that gives the
constructive interference has to

00:21:16.461 --> 00:21:19.958
be an integral multiple of the
wavelength.

00:21:19.958 --> 00:21:24.564
That's where we're headed.
Now, see this line from atom

00:21:24.564 --> 00:21:29.000
number two to the screen?
I called it D2.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:35.137
D2 is the length of that line.
It's the distance that the wave

00:21:35.137 --> 00:21:39.161
has traveled from atom two to
the screen.

00:21:39.161 --> 00:21:44.896
D1 is the distance that the
wave scattered from atom 1 has

00:21:44.896 --> 00:21:49.725
traveled to the screen.
Now, I am going to draw a

00:21:49.725 --> 00:21:54.253
perpendicular right here.
I am going to draw a

00:21:54.253 --> 00:21:58.378
perpendicular from atom 1 to
this line D2.

00:21:58.378 --> 00:22:04.454
Here is the right angle.
That is really nice because

00:22:04.454 --> 00:22:08.545
look at what this leg of the
triangle is then.

00:22:08.545 --> 00:22:13.909
It's D2 minus D1.
That's a quantity that's going

00:22:13.909 --> 00:22:18.909
to be interesting to us.
Now, what you have to do is you

00:22:18.909 --> 00:22:23.909
have to convince yourself that
this angle right in here,

00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:27.909
in this triangle,
is equal to this scattering

00:22:27.909 --> 00:22:32.278
angle theta.
If you're good at geometry you

00:22:32.278 --> 00:22:36.151
can see that immediately,
or you might have to think

00:22:36.151 --> 00:22:39.645
about it a little bit,
but it is equal to that.

00:22:39.645 --> 00:22:44.202
Well, that's good because now
I've got a triangle right here.

00:22:44.202 --> 00:22:46.708
And I know the length of one
side.

00:22:46.708 --> 00:22:50.354
That is the distance,
the spacing between the two

00:22:50.354 --> 00:22:54.303
nickel atoms in the crystal.
And I know what theta is

00:22:54.303 --> 00:22:57.949
because that's what Davidson and
Germer measured.

00:22:57.949 --> 00:23:02.719
Pretty good.
I can use this geometry to say

00:23:02.719 --> 00:23:08.066
that sine theta is equal to the
length of the opposite side,

00:23:08.066 --> 00:23:11.148
D2 minus D1,
over the hypotenuse A.

00:23:11.148 --> 00:23:16.042
And now, if this is the

00:23:16.042 --> 00:23:21.661
condition that has to obtain to
have constructive interference,

00:23:21.661 --> 00:23:27.280
and then this expression comes
from the geometry of the problem

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:31.960
that I'm solving --
So, this is the theory,

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:35.965
this is the geometry of the
problem I'm solving.

00:23:35.965 --> 00:23:40.312
Well, then N lambda has to be
equal to A sine theta.

00:23:40.312 --> 00:23:43.977
And, therefore,

00:23:43.977 --> 00:23:48.664
I can rearrange that to get
lambda, lambda is equal to A

00:23:48.664 --> 00:23:53.267
sine theta divided by N.

00:23:53.267 --> 00:23:57.613
And now I can use this
information here to calculate

00:23:57.613 --> 00:24:02.191
what lambda is.
I know that the scattering

00:24:02.191 --> 00:24:05.477
angle is 50.7 degrees.
I know what N is.

00:24:05.477 --> 00:24:09.691
It's the first-order
diffraction feature because it

00:24:09.691 --> 00:24:14.578
is the most intense spot that is
closest to the zero-order.

00:24:14.578 --> 00:24:19.466
The zero-order is always going
to be normal to your sample,

00:24:19.466 --> 00:24:23.511
normal to the crystal.
Therefore, I can plug some

00:24:23.511 --> 00:24:27.303
numbers in there.
And I get for the wavelength

00:24:27.303 --> 00:24:33.218
1.66x10^-10 meters.
This experiment says that if

00:24:33.218 --> 00:24:38.160
you have electrons that are 54
eV in energy,

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:44.482
the wavelength of those
electrons is 1.66x10^-10 meters.

00:24:44.482 --> 00:24:48.275
So, Davidson,
Germer and Thompson,

00:24:48.275 --> 00:24:54.942
not only did they demonstrate
the interference phenomena of

00:24:54.942 --> 00:25:00.000
particles, particles that had
mass.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.583
But they were able to calculate
from that experiment the

00:25:04.583 --> 00:25:07.916
wavelength, the corresponding
wavelength.

00:25:07.916 --> 00:25:12.000
But now I just want to take a
moment, as an aside,

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.166
to tell you that this geometry
that I illustrated right here is

00:25:17.166 --> 00:25:21.833
the identical geometry that is
used in X-ray diffraction.

00:25:21.833 --> 00:25:26.416
X-ray diffraction is the
interference or the diffraction

00:25:26.416 --> 00:25:31.260
of X-rays, photons.
This is electron diffraction.

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:35.781
But the geometries are the
same, the concepts are the same.

00:25:35.781 --> 00:25:40.224
The reason I bring up X-ray
diffraction is because it is a

00:25:40.224 --> 00:25:43.888
very important technique for you
in your future,

00:25:43.888 --> 00:25:48.331
whether you're going to be
looking at materials to get the

00:25:48.331 --> 00:25:52.775
structure of materials or
whether you're going to be doing

00:25:52.775 --> 00:25:55.347
some kind of biological
chemistry.

00:25:55.347 --> 00:25:59.322
Because X-ray diffraction is
used to get structures,

00:25:59.322 --> 00:26:04.000
crystal structures,
particularly of proteins.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.149
And the reason why you want to
know the structure of a protein

00:26:09.149 --> 00:26:14.214
is because that structure does
give you some hints as to what

00:26:14.214 --> 00:26:17.928
the function of the protein is.
And actually,

00:26:17.928 --> 00:26:21.727
Professor Drennan,
who is going to lecture the

00:26:21.727 --> 00:26:25.694
second half of the course,
that's her specialty,

00:26:25.694 --> 00:26:30.000
is X-ray diffraction of crystal
proteins.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.585
And I am sure she'll tell you
much more about that.

00:26:34.585 --> 00:26:39.263
In X-ray diffraction,
what they do is they use those

00:26:39.263 --> 00:26:44.124
results, not to get the
wavelength, but they use those

00:26:44.124 --> 00:26:49.352
results to get this distance
here, A, the distance between

00:26:49.352 --> 00:26:52.928
the atoms.
That's what I mean by getting

00:26:52.928 --> 00:26:56.505
out the structure.
In X-ray diffraction,

00:26:56.505 --> 00:27:01.000
they're coming in with an X-ray
beam.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.027
And they know what the
wavelength is of their X-ray

00:27:05.027 --> 00:27:07.686
beam, so they know what lambda
is.

00:27:07.686 --> 00:27:11.069
And then they go and measure
what theta is,

00:27:11.069 --> 00:27:15.177
the scattering angle.
And from those two quantities,

00:27:15.177 --> 00:27:18.641
lambda and theta,
they figure out what A is,

00:27:18.641 --> 00:27:23.152
the distance between the atoms
and therefore work out the

00:27:23.152 --> 00:27:27.502
structure of the protein.
That is how X-ray diffraction

00:27:27.502 --> 00:27:35.191
is actually used.
I think I can turn these back

00:27:35.191 --> 00:27:40.203
on.
Let me just get this up a

00:27:40.203 --> 00:27:47.722
little bit.
I'm not going to get the screen

00:27:47.722 --> 00:27:56.135
all the way up because I still
want that number,

00:27:56.135 --> 00:28:01.575
actually.
Not only did Davidson and

00:28:01.575 --> 00:28:06.624
Germer, and Thompson,
demonstrate the interference

00:28:06.624 --> 00:28:13.012
phenomena, but they also got out
of all of that a value for the

00:28:13.012 --> 00:28:17.030
wavelength.
And that was very important.

00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:23.212
And the reason why it was so
important is because a few years

00:28:23.212 --> 00:28:27.745
before, 1924,
there was a prediction for what

00:28:27.745 --> 00:28:33.000
the wavelength of particles
ought to be.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.702
And that prediction was made by
this gentleman,

00:28:37.702 --> 00:28:41.281
de Broglie.
De Broglie, in his Ph.D.

00:28:41.281 --> 00:28:45.881
thesis, no less,
he made a prediction for what

00:28:45.881 --> 00:28:49.869
the wavelength of particles
ought to be.

00:28:49.869 --> 00:28:55.492
What he did is took the
relativistic equations of motion

00:28:55.492 --> 00:29:01.830
of Einstein, the same identical
equations he knew of Einstein's

00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:05.000
work, Ph.D.
thesis.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:11.818
He realized that those
relativistic equations of motion

00:29:11.818 --> 00:29:18.510
applied to matter as well as to
photons, to radiation.

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:22.550
And so he said,
that if you have,

00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:28.737
of course, a photon which has a
wavelength lambda,

00:29:28.737 --> 00:29:31.433
--
-- of course,

00:29:31.433 --> 00:29:35.625
then that momentum of that
photon is p.

00:29:35.625 --> 00:29:40.698
But since those equations also
apply to matter,

00:29:40.698 --> 00:29:45.220
he then said,
well, if you have a particle

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:50.183
with momentum p,
that particle ought to have a

00:29:50.183 --> 00:29:54.375
wavelength lambda.
He turned Einstein's

00:29:54.375 --> 00:30:00.000
relativistic equations of motion
around.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.256
Well, if radiation has a
wavelength lambda,

00:30:04.256 --> 00:30:09.831
it ought to have momentum p.
This is what Einstein said.

00:30:09.831 --> 00:30:13.885
De Broglie said,
well then, matter with a

00:30:13.885 --> 00:30:18.141
momentum p better have a
wavelength lambda.

00:30:18.141 --> 00:30:23.209
That's de Broglie's wavelength.
Isn't that amazing?

00:30:23.209 --> 00:30:28.277
I think that's amazing.
Why didn't Einstein realize

00:30:28.277 --> 00:30:33.097
this?
Or did Einstein realize that?

00:30:33.097 --> 00:30:37.048
I don't know.
But let's see about this

00:30:37.048 --> 00:30:41.961
prediction here.
What we know is that in the de

00:30:41.961 --> 00:30:47.194
Broglie experiment that we had
electrons of 54 eV.

00:30:47.194 --> 00:30:52.961
That is the kinetic energy,
that's one half m v squared.

00:30:52.961 --> 00:30:57.766
You can write kinetic energy as

00:30:57.766 --> 00:31:03.000
p squared over.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.387
You can convince yourself of
this.

00:31:06.387 --> 00:31:11.519
This is useful to know for
these kinds of problems,

00:31:11.519 --> 00:31:15.523
p squared over 2m is the
kinetic energy.

00:31:15.523 --> 00:31:21.066
Therefore, if this is the
energy, you can calculate the

00:31:21.066 --> 00:31:24.453
momentum of those 54 eV
electrons.

00:31:24.453 --> 00:31:30.304
So, the momentum is 4.0x10^-24
kilograms meters per second.

00:31:30.304 --> 00:31:37.245
Now we can use de Broglie's

00:31:37.245 --> 00:31:42.413
wavelength here,
that expression that he had

00:31:42.413 --> 00:31:49.144
gotten out of Einstein's
relativistic equations of motion

00:31:49.144 --> 00:31:55.033
to solve for lambda.
That is h, 6.626x10^-34 joule

00:31:55.033 --> 00:31:59.000
seconds over the momentum.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.524
And that gives 1.7x10^-10
meters.

00:32:07.524 --> 00:32:13.691
The same as the experiment.
It predicted exactly what the

00:32:13.691 --> 00:32:20.189
experimentalist measured for the
wavelength of the electron.

00:32:20.189 --> 00:32:26.356
This was a real coup here for
de Broglie and for science.

00:32:26.356 --> 00:32:30.669
What do we have?
We have Davidson,

00:32:30.669 --> 00:32:35.383
Germer and George Thompson who
have demonstrated,

00:32:35.383 --> 00:32:40.785
and in particular George
Thompson, who have demonstrated

00:32:40.785 --> 00:32:44.616
that an electron has wave-like
behavior.

00:32:44.616 --> 00:32:48.250
In contrast,
here is George Thompson's

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:49.428
father, J.
J.

00:32:49.428 --> 00:32:55.419
Thompson, who has demonstrated
that an electron is a particle,

00:32:55.419 --> 00:32:59.348
has mass.
And both the son and the father

00:32:59.348 --> 00:33:06.378
are correct.
How often does that happen?

00:33:06.378 --> 00:33:15.621
It's a really amazing story.
Now I am going to have to put

00:33:15.621 --> 00:33:23.891
the lights off here.
I'm getting my lights confused.

00:33:23.891 --> 00:33:33.297
Now we're at the point where we
can begin to understand the

00:33:33.297 --> 00:33:41.720
structure of the atom.
Because it was this realization

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:47.720
of wave-like properties,
it was that realization of

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:55.279
those wave-like properties that
led this gentleman right here to

00:33:55.279 --> 00:34:02.240
realize that maybe he had to
treat the electrons as a wave,

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:05.000
Mr.
Schrödinger.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.298
It was that realization that
led Mr.

00:34:09.298 --> 00:34:15.438
Schrödinger to write down the
Schrödinger equation,

00:34:15.438 --> 00:34:20.842
the wave equation,
the equation of motion for

00:34:20.842 --> 00:34:28.210
particles like an electron that
actually have a wavelength on

00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:36.388
the order of their environment.
Actually, I just realized that

00:34:36.388 --> 00:34:42.487
I skipped something in your
notes that I wanted to talk

00:34:42.487 --> 00:34:45.988
about.
And I apologize for that.

00:34:45.988 --> 00:34:51.749
We're going to get to the wave
equation in a moment,

00:34:51.749 --> 00:34:57.057
it's very important.
But I did want to just talk

00:34:57.057 --> 00:35:02.705
about, for a moment,
why if particles have waves or

00:35:02.705 --> 00:35:08.352
have wake-like phenomena,
then why then hadn't this

00:35:08.352 --> 00:35:14.000
wave-like phenomena been seen
before?

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.456
What this also should mean with
de Broglie is that you and I

00:35:19.456 --> 00:35:23.526
have a wavelength because we've
got momentum,

00:35:23.526 --> 00:35:28.427
we've got mass times velocity,
we also ought to have a

00:35:28.427 --> 00:35:31.022
wavelength.
Pardon?

00:35:31.022 --> 00:35:35.698
They take a while to go up,
yeah.

00:35:35.698 --> 00:35:43.150
Let's consider the problem with
our wavelength here.

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:50.602
Well, let's talk about the
wavelength of a baseball.

00:35:50.602 --> 00:35:59.223
We have a five ounce baseball
being pitched by Curt Shilling

00:35:59.223 --> 00:36:04.580
at 90 mph.
And it's being pitched at a

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:10.027
very large nickel crystal.
Let's think of an experiment of

00:36:10.027 --> 00:36:15.569
diffraction of baseballs from a
large crystal just like the

00:36:15.569 --> 00:36:20.634
diffraction of the electrons
from that nickel crystal.

00:36:20.634 --> 00:36:25.508
Well, let's calculate the
momentum of that baseball.

00:36:25.508 --> 00:36:30.000
That momentum is m times v.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.517
And 5 ounces,
90 miles per hour,

00:36:33.517 --> 00:36:39.191
get all your units right,
is 5.6 kilogram meter per

00:36:39.191 --> 00:36:42.936
second.
Then we're going to use de

00:36:42.936 --> 00:36:49.063
Broglie's relationship right
here to calculate what the

00:36:49.063 --> 00:36:53.375
wavelength is of that pitched
baseball.

00:36:53.375 --> 00:36:58.709
And when we do that lambda is
equal to h over p.

00:36:58.709 --> 00:37:03.272
He put in this p.
He put in h.

00:37:03.272 --> 00:37:07.303
That comes out to be 1.2x10^-34
meters.

00:37:07.303 --> 00:37:10.803
Pretty small.
But what do we know?

00:37:10.803 --> 00:37:16.848
Well, we know the condition for
constructive interference,

00:37:16.848 --> 00:37:21.621
D2 minus D1 has to be equal to
N times lambda,

00:37:21.621 --> 00:37:24.909
has to be equal to A sine
theta.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.397
Now let's calculate what the
angle theta ought to be for the

00:37:35.397 --> 00:37:40.611
first-order diffraction feature
of baseballs from a nickel

00:37:40.611 --> 00:37:43.447
crystal.
You have Curt Schilling

00:37:43.447 --> 00:37:48.570
throwing these baseballs one
after another at this nickel

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:54.059
crystal, and you're trying to
see at what angle you are going

00:37:54.059 --> 00:37:59.000
to see that first-order
diffraction feature.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:06.849
Well, we can set this up so
that sine theta here is going to

00:38:06.849 --> 00:38:14.699
be equal to N lambda over A.
So N is 1, lambda is 1.2x10^-34

00:38:14.699 --> 00:38:20.021
meters, and then A is
2.15x10^-10 meters.

00:38:20.021 --> 00:38:26.008
If you go and evaluate what
theta ought to be,

00:38:26.008 --> 00:38:32.839
it's 3x10^-23 degrees.
That means if I have my huge

00:38:32.839 --> 00:38:38.416
nickel crystal here and here's
the normal to the sample,

00:38:38.416 --> 00:38:44.195
well, then that first-order
diffraction feature here is at

00:38:44.195 --> 00:38:47.846
about 10^-23 degrees from the
normal.

00:38:47.846 --> 00:38:51.902
Are you going to be able to
resolve that?

00:38:51.902 --> 00:38:55.248
No.
You're not going to be able to

00:38:55.248 --> 00:39:01.477
see the normal reflection.
And then no baseballs.

00:39:01.477 --> 00:39:06.095
And then a very intense beam of
baseballs.

00:39:06.095 --> 00:39:12.064
You're not going to be able to
resolve 10^-23 degrees.

00:39:12.064 --> 00:39:16.682
You say, well,
okay, if that's the problem

00:39:16.682 --> 00:39:23.215
then maybe I can help myself out
by changing this A here by

00:39:23.215 --> 00:39:29.409
changing the distance of my
particles that are doing the

00:39:29.409 --> 00:39:34.116
diffracting.
My two nickel atoms.

00:39:34.116 --> 00:39:40.040
Let's change that distance.
Let's find some other crystal

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:44.907
such that I change that distance
to, let's see,

00:39:44.907 --> 00:39:50.515
how about 7x10^-33 meters.
When I do that and I go and

00:39:50.515 --> 00:39:56.969
calculate what theta ought to
be, that first-order diffraction

00:39:56.969 --> 00:40:01.095
feature, well,
that comes out to about 1

00:40:01.095 --> 00:40:06.515
degree.
If I was pitching baseballs at

00:40:06.515 --> 00:40:12.492
the normal angle and I was
looking to see if I had a

00:40:12.492 --> 00:40:18.585
maximum of baseballs 1 degree
from that normal angle,

00:40:18.585 --> 00:40:21.750
could I resolve that?
Maybe.

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:27.960
Maybe you could get an
experiment like that and set it

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:33.000
up, but the problem is right
here.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:40.264
The problem is in this A,
the distance between the atoms

00:40:40.264 --> 00:40:47.132
in the nickel crystal that are
going to reflect these

00:40:47.132 --> 00:40:51.754
baseballs.
This distance is 7x10^-33

00:40:51.754 --> 00:40:56.377
meters.
How big is the diameter of a

00:40:56.377 --> 00:40:58.094
nucleus?
What?

00:40:58.094 --> 00:41:03.230
Negative 10?
How about another number.

00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:06.531
Negative 11?
How about another number.

00:41:06.531 --> 00:41:08.048
14.
10^-14 meters,

00:41:08.048 --> 00:41:12.955
that's a good number to know.
What am I looking at here?

00:41:12.955 --> 00:41:17.594
I'm looking at a distance
between the atoms of 10^-33

00:41:17.594 --> 00:41:20.717
meters.
We're 20 orders of magnitude

00:41:20.717 --> 00:41:25.000
smaller than the size of the
nucleus.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:30.473
Do we have a crystal to
diffract baseballs off of where

00:41:30.473 --> 00:41:33.819
the atoms are 10^-33 meters
apart?

00:41:33.819 --> 00:41:37.873
Uh-uh, we don't.
And that's why wave-like

00:41:37.873 --> 00:41:43.550
phenomena on macroscopic
particles has not been observed,

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:47.706
because our wavelengths,
your wavelengths,

00:41:47.706 --> 00:41:51.356
my wavelengths,
baseball wavelengths,

00:41:51.356 --> 00:41:54.904
these wavelengths are way too
small.

00:41:54.904 --> 00:42:02.000
They're way too small because
the mass is way too large.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:07.066
And so there is no way in the
macroscopic world that we're

00:42:07.066 --> 00:42:11.688
going to see any effects,
any wave-like behavior from

00:42:11.688 --> 00:42:16.133
macroscopic objects.
Our wavelengths are too small.

00:42:16.133 --> 00:42:20.222
There is no way to see that
wave-like behavior.

00:42:20.222 --> 00:42:25.555
You're going to need slits or
you're going to need atoms that

00:42:25.555 --> 00:42:30.000
are about 10^-33 meters from
each other.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:36.116
And that's just not practical.
For macroscopic objects,

00:42:36.116 --> 00:42:40.760
for you and me,
our wavelengths don't mean

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:45.064
anything.
They are of no consequence in

00:42:45.064 --> 00:42:49.595
the observation of what we see
around us.

00:42:49.595 --> 00:42:56.051
However, they have lots of
consequences for particles such

00:42:56.051 --> 00:43:02.394
as an electron whose environment
is on the scale of their

00:43:02.394 --> 00:43:06.434
wavelength.
I am saying here,

00:43:06.434 --> 00:43:11.412
in this case for the electron
where the wavelength is 10^-10

00:43:11.412 --> 00:43:16.728
meters, is that is a wavelength
that is on the order of the size

00:43:16.728 --> 00:43:20.103
of the electron's environment in
an atom.

00:43:20.103 --> 00:43:23.140
That's 10^-10 meters.
In those cases,

00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:27.949
when that wavelength is about
the size of the environment,

00:43:27.949 --> 00:43:32.000
then the wave-like properties
matter.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.282
They matter.
You see the interference

00:43:35.282 --> 00:43:38.929
phenomena.
You see those effects of those

00:43:38.929 --> 00:43:43.670
wave-like properties.
And it is just that realization

00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:48.047
that led Schrödinger here,
who is now washed out,

00:43:48.047 --> 00:43:51.785
to write down the wave equation
of motion.

00:43:51.785 --> 00:43:56.435
And that's an equation of
motion for particles whose

00:43:56.435 --> 00:44:03.000
wavelength is on the order of
the size of their environment.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:08.086
And you have to use that
equation of motion to understand

00:44:08.086 --> 00:44:10.810
how that electron,
so to speak,

00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:14.080
moves.
You cannot use F equals ma.

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:17.440
And that is where we will pick

00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:18.640
up next Wednesday.
