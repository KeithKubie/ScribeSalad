00:00:00.249 --> 00:00:05.640
The differences in reproductive values of
sperm vs eggs, and the resulting conflicts

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.240
of interest between males who want more sex,
and females who have had enough, have resulted

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.240
in the evolution of some pretty extravagant
strategies for males to be reproductively

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.570
successful.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:23.300
After all, if a female has enough sperm in
her storage organ she is probably not interested

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.480
in receiving any more.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.220
And this is bad news for any guy who has yet
to make his own sperm deposit.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.390
So, what can he do to convince a lady that
his sperm might be worth an extra roll in

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.969
the hay?

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.329
Presents!

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:43.220
Male nursery web spiders bring gifts to females,
the bigger and heavier, the better.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:50.239
These gifts can take diverse forms, from prey
items, to glandular secretions, water, specialized

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.930
meals - or even parts of his own body!

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.870
And these aren’t any cheap gifts.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.750
They are giving a female an expensive present
in exchange for sex.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.680
Well, most of the males.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:10.070
About 30% of the time, male nursery web spiders
provide females with dummy gifts - pieces

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.390
of garbage, arthropod exoskeletons, or plants.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.270
These are made to look like the high-quality
gifts of their rivals.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.250
Basically, designer knockoffs.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.120
In addition to appearing authentic, they come
in several layers of wrapping.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.729
Females must take the time to unwrap them
before discovering their true quality, time

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.280
in which the male might already have gotten
started.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.640
Since the cheating spiders are not spending
any time or energy in actually hunting and

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.250
killing a ‘nice’ gift they have more time
for a higher number of copulation attempts,

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.000
but with a lower level of sperm transfer.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.899
The good news is that since the cheating males
realize a lower level of sexual success, fewer

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.140
of their cheating genes will be sustained
in future generations.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.270
The males giving legitimate gifts will always
be more reproductively successful, meaning

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.440
that the balance of power stays with them.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.180
This is great news for jilted ladies.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:15.790
Hold out for the high-quality goods - bugs,
secretions, eight-legged back rubs. they will

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.010
come your way eventually.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.670
