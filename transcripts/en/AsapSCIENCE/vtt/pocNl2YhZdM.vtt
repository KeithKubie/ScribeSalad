00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.320
 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.860
I'll be the spark if you'll be the flame

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.620
Start a reaction that can't be contained

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.320
Balance your pH by sharing my base

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.640
I'll be your star if you'll be my space

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.000
'Cause there is no distance that I wouldn't go

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:31.320
Through space-time and wormholes my matter would flow, to the edge of the universe

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.380
I'll be your G if you will be C or I can be A if you will be T

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.260
If there's a mutation I'll fix every base

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.460
Working as your zinc finger nuclease

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.460
Just like an atom

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.880
Don't rip us apart

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.640
Unless you want a big BOOM!

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.720
In my heart

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.780
 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.480
We can take it fast, or really slow

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.940
But we can't know, with certainty, where we'll go

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.880
If at first we don't succeed, we'll try two more times

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.340
So our failure's a statistically significant try

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.260
Like an equation, it all works out

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:27.580
If we balance the sides there's no need to doubt

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.920
This is your science love song

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.140
A place to start our chemical bond

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.400
A research endeavour

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.940
We can write the conclusion together

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.600
Just like the moview I'd steal your heart

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.460
But then you'd die... so I won't do that

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.020
If we broke up, I'd be no more

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.780
I'd give up H20 for H2SO4

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.020
Take away gravity, I'd still fall for you

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.800
Share my last electron in a covalent bond for two

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.780
'Cause you're like that angle, Acute and you're smart

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.820
Your labcoat and goggles go straight to my heart

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.960
Except that's a lie, cause the heart doesn't feel

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.860
When it comes to love the brain seals the deal

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.880
This is your science love song

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.020
A place to start our chemical bond

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.940
A research endeavour

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.040
We can write the conclusion

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.840
-conclusion together

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.860
With twenty annotations and bibliography

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:10.220
'Cause you matter to me

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:15.960
