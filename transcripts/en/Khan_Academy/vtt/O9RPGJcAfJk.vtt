00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.720
- [Instructor] Let's try
to name this molecule

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:03.553
right over here.

00:00:03.553 --> 00:00:04.450
And so the first thing we wanna do

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:06.997
is identify the longest chain of carbons.

00:00:06.997 --> 00:00:09.020
So let's see, it could be one, two, three,

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.810
four, five, six, seven, eight.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:13.740
Or, let's see, maybe it's one, two, three,

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.240
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.760
Yes, indeed, that's the longest chain.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.534
And if you go one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven,

00:00:21.534 --> 00:00:24.210
or one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.270
So those aren't the longest.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.420
So the longest one is this one.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.420
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.030
eight, nine, 10, 10 carbons.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.570
And this is going to be an alkane,

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.620
'cause it's all single bonds.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.220
And an alkane that's
a chain of 10 carbons,

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.780
we would use a prefix deck for 10.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.920
So this is a decane.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.230
Let me write that right over here.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.610
This is a decane, decane.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.050
Now, let's think about the groups

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.632
that are attached to this decane.

00:01:03.632 --> 00:01:07.320
So we have this group right over here.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.400
This has two carbons in it,

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.730
one carbon, two carbons.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.740
And so because it has two carbons,

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.340
we would use the prefix eth.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.150
Remember, meth is one carbon.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.379
Eth is two carbons.

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:21.940
And since it's a group,

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.460
we're not talking about the backbone,

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.820
this is an ethyl group.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.420
This is an ethyl group.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.330
And we have another ethyl
group right over here,

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.020
two carbons attached right over here.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.900
This is also an ethyl group.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.100
And now this group right
over here is interesting.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.190
We can count the carbons in it.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.940
So it has one, two, three carbons.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.440
So you could think about,
well, this has three carbons.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.430
Our prefix for there carbons is prop.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.688
So you could say it maybe
this is a propyl group.

00:01:50.688 --> 00:01:52.483
This right over here.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.660
This right over here.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.620
You could say maybe
this is a propyl group.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.730
And you wouldn't be completely
off base by saying that.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.730
But we have to be a little bit
more careful when we name it,

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.210
because a propyl group, you would assume

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.390
that you're attaching to
one end of the propyl group.

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.614
But we're not attaching to
one end of the propyl group.

00:02:11.614 --> 00:02:14.480
We're attaching essentially
to the second carbon,

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.610
to the middle carbon.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.330
And this is a secondary carbon.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.580
The reason why it's
called a secondary carbon

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.210
is because it's attached
to two other carbons.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.730
If it was attached to three other carbons,

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.010
it would be a tertiary carbon.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.210
If it was attached to only one carbon,

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.671
it would be a primary carbon.

00:02:30.671 --> 00:02:32.230
So you could call this,

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.063
since we're attached

00:02:33.063 --> 00:02:36.370
to the secondary carbon right over here.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.533
This is sometimes called a sec,

00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:41.500
a sec-propyl group.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.810
A sec-propyl group.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.480
And it's also sometimes called iso-propyl,

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.293
an isopropyl group.

00:02:47.293 --> 00:02:49.640
Isopropyl, and you'll
actually see isopropyl

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.240
a little bit more frequently.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.680
And these would both be
referred to as common names,

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.290
common names for this group.

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.350
Now, if you wanted to
name this systematically,

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.530
then you would do it very similar

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.270
to the way you would
name the entire molecule.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.020
You would look for the longest chain here.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.510
And the longest chain in this molecule,

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.830
starting with where you are attached,

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.623
is a chain of two carbons,

00:03:13.623 --> 00:03:15.622
is a chain of two carbons.

00:03:15.622 --> 00:03:17.130
And so you could call,

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.987
so that the backbone
right over here is ethyl,

00:03:19.987 --> 00:03:22.973
is, let me write this right over here,

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.330
is ethyl, it's an ethyl backbone here.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.440
And then you could view
this carbon as a group

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.620
attached to that ethyl backbone.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.900
And we would start counting,

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.360
we would start counting
right where we're attached

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.193
to the main chain.

00:03:40.193 --> 00:03:42.360
So this is the one carbon,
this is the two carbon.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.076
So this right over here, this
is just one carbon group.

00:03:45.076 --> 00:03:48.480
This right over here is an methyl group,

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.570
or a methyl group, this is a methyl group.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.010
So you have a methyl group attached

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.840
to the one carbon of an ethyl group.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.790
So the systematic name for this,

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.160
and this is a little bit less typical

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.630
for a group as small as a propyl group.

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.977
But you could call this one methyl,

00:04:03.977 --> 00:04:08.977
one, one methyl, one methyl-ethyl,

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.720
one methyl-ethyl is the
systematic name for this.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.610
Now, the systematic name,

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.097
you might say, "Hey,
why go through the pain

00:04:19.097 --> 00:04:20.707
"of doing this for something so simple

00:04:20.707 --> 00:04:22.410
"that we could just call isopropyl."

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.288
This is useful if this was a much larger

00:04:24.288 --> 00:04:27.420
or a much more complex
group that was attached

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:28.840
to this main chain.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:29.900
But, more typically,

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.210
and this is why it's
called the common name,

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.280
you will see this thing right over here

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.820
just called isopropyl.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.640
And sometimes you would
see it called sec-propyl

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.970
or even S-propyl.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.080
Now that we've named all of the groups,

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.270
let's think about what
carbons they are attached to

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.050
and where we can start counting from.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.410
And the way that this is done

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.561
is that you would start counting

00:04:49.561 --> 00:04:51.370
from the end of your carbon chain,

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.280
your main, kind of this decane backbone.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.670
And you would count from the end

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.410
that bumps into the most groups faster.

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.870
So, for example, if you
count from this end,

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.880
this would be the one carbon,

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.880
two carbon, three carbon,
four carbon, five carbon.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.020
On the five carbon, we
bump into two groups.

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.380
If we started over here,

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.430
this would be the one carbon,
two carbon, three carbon,

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.400
four carbon, five carbon.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.040
On the five carbon, we
do bump into a group,

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.950
but only one group.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.450
And we'd have to wait
until the sixth carbon

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.071
to bump into two groups.

00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:23.470
So we get to the two groups faster,

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:24.774
we would start counting on this end.

00:05:24.774 --> 00:05:27.110
So this is the one carbon, two carbon,

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.371
three carbon, four carbon,
five carbon, six carbon,

00:05:31.371 --> 00:05:36.371
seven carbon, eight, nine and 10 carbon.

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.300
And so when we think about which groups

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.270
are we going to refer to first,

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.850
do we refer to the ethyl groups first

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.290
or do we refer to this
isopropyl group first?

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:51.380
We just think about what
letter they start with

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:52.430
in alphabetical order.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.125
So, for example, these ethyl groups,

00:05:55.125 --> 00:05:57.145
they clearly start with an E.

00:05:57.145 --> 00:06:01.100
They clearly start with an E.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.132
E comes before in the alphabet
than the I in isopropyl

00:06:05.132 --> 00:06:07.430
before the P in sec-propyl.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.150
You would normally ignore
the sec or the tert

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:11.750
when you're thinking
about alphabetical order.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:16.750
And E also comes before
the M in methyl-ethyl.

00:06:17.831 --> 00:06:21.560
So we will talk about
the ethyl groups first.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.480
So, remember, our backbone, 10 carbons,

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.510
all single bonds.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.340
It's an alkane, since there's
10 of 'em it is decane.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.460
And so let's talk about the ethyls first.

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.260
And since we had two ethyls

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.320
we can say that this is diethyl.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.781
So let me write that down.

00:06:35.781 --> 00:06:38.133
So we can write diethyl, diethyl.

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.095
And, of course, we need to specify

00:06:43.095 --> 00:06:46.300
where those two ethyls are.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.640
One is at the five carbon,

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.750
one is at the sixth carbon.

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:54.393
So we could call this
five, five, six, diethyl.

00:06:54.393 --> 00:06:56.700
The five refers to this ethyl group.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.270
Six refers to this ethyl group.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.840
And now we could talk
about the isopropyl group.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.697
The isopropyl group is
also on the five carbon.

00:07:04.697 --> 00:07:09.497
So we could say five, six diethyl,

00:07:09.497 --> 00:07:13.736
five, five isopropyl.

00:07:13.736 --> 00:07:18.493
Isopropyl, isopropyl,

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:21.300
decane.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.320
Or, if wanted to use sec-propyl

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.870
instead of isopropyl, we
could write sec-propyl here.

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:28.770
Or if want to do the systematic naming

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:30.210
we could call this

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:34.413
five, comma, six, di, diethyl.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:40.820
Five, instead of writing isopropyl here

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:44.460
we could write all of this,
one methyl-ethyl here.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.522
So actually let me just
copy and paste that.

00:07:46.522 --> 00:07:51.023
Let me just copy this one
methyl-ethyl right over here.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.480
Copy and paste.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.530
Let me stick that there.

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:57.760
One methyl ethyl.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.461
And, of course, the
main backbone is decane.

00:08:01.461 --> 00:08:06.461
Decane, decane.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.740
So either one, all of these,

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.140
are reasonable ways to name it.

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:11.340
This would be the common way

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.690
where we use isopropyl.

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:14.550
Here, we're doing it more systematically

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:17.083
by calling it group one methyl-ethyl.
