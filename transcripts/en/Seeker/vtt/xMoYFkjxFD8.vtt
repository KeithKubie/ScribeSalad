00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.070
Donating blood is a great sacrifice.

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.580
You're literally giving a bit of yourself
to help another.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.980
So why can't some people give blood?

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.720
Is this science, or prejudice?

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.380
Hello humans, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.990
Blood donation is seen by some, as a civil
right.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.970
People making a sacrifice, literally weakening
themselves, to help strangers.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.119
But, according to the FDA, men who have sex
with men -- known as MSM -- aren't treated

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.930
equally when it comes to blood donation, and
some have gone as far to imply they're banned

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.059
from doing so.

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:36.319
Firstly, that's not true.

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:40.079
Men who have sex with men, (as well as women
and transgender persons who have sex with

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.409
MSM) are all required to wait 12 months after
their most recent risky sexual contact before

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:47.859
they can donate.

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:49.909
But they CAN donate.

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:51.729
But does that even make sense?

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:55.890
MSM populations have blood, we need blood…
why not allow them donation?

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.569
It all comes back to HIV.

00:00:57.569 --> 00:01:02.249
In 1981, a severe disease of epidemic proportions
was spreading through the gay community, killing

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:04.030
hundreds of thousands of men and women.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.920
At first, it was called GRID -- gay-related
immunodeficiency disease.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.759
Later, it was renamed the Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.560
AIDS put the public in a frenzy, and rightly
so.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.789
229-thousand people died due to AIDS from
1981 to 1992.

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:27.509
And once it was discovered to be bloodborne,
people realized some had acquired it through

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.220
infected blood transfusion.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.079
So, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
decided to act passing a lifetime ban on blood

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.321
donation from any men who had ever had sex
with another man (again known as MSM -- men

00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:42.259
who have sex with men); this was in 1983...

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.140
In 1985, a test called ELISA was invented
which could detect antibodies created by the

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.229
human immune system in response to infection
by the HIV virus which causes AIDS!

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.520
So, now that blood could be screened, we didn't
need the ban, right?

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.850
We just needed to know if someone had HIV,
and screen those who weren't sure!

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:02.850
Right?

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:03.850
Nope.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.509
The Ban remained until 2015, when it was revised
to the current -- abstain from sex for a year,

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.509
bro.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:11.509
Then come back.

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:15.830
Even though, since 1987, HIV blood screening
tests have become nearly 100 percent accurate,

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.349
putting it on par with Hepatitis screening;
MSM populations are still singled out.

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:25.400
Which is weird, because I'm pretty sure anal
sex isn't confined to just gay, and bisexual

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.890
men… women can have anal intercourse, and
can carry and spread HIV.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.480
So why aren't they subject to the same restrictions?

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.069
Well, because 72 percent of new HIV infections
occur in gay men, who only make up 2 percent

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.450
of the population.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.790
Because of the thin lining of the rectum,
unprotected anal intercourse is up to 18 times

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.319
more risky than vaginal sex.

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.209
Blood and fluids are more easily exchanged,
meaning HIV transmission risk increases.

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.019
But not everyone in the MSM community has
HIV, or has unprotected sex.

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:02.180
I mean, monogamous gay, transgender, and bisexual
partners without HIV literally cannot spread

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.829
a virus they don't have!

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.280
But they're subject to the same 12-month deferment.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.110
So, yes, the original ban came from fear of
the unknown; fear of AIDS and HIV drove the

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.409
FDA to simply eliminate the risk entirely,
but now according to AIDS dot gov, we have

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:21.970
some of the safest blood in the world.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.909
Donated blood goes through more than a dozen
screens and tests looking for evidence of

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:31.269
West Nile, Syphilis, Hepatitis, HIV and parasites
like Malaria, among other things.

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.489
And though it's perceived as unfair, the CDC
and FDA believe it's better to ask gay men

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.849
to wait a year to ensure the HIV appears in
the tests.

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.190
That being said, The Columbia Medical Review
writes that HIV infection can be tested accurately

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:49.370
within two weeks of exposure, and in light
of blood shortages, they recommend a new process:

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.860
Simply this: ask everyone about their risky
sexual behaviors before they donate blood:

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.959
Men, women, transgender, non-binary, asexual,
everyone.

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:02.560
Then, those who are unsure of their HIV exposure,
can be deferred until they're sure, and everyone

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.950
else can donate frickin' blood.

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.180
Especially since we're screening everyone
anyway.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.920
As they put it, succinctly: a "lifetime ban
is medically and scientifically unwarranted."

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.190
According to the American Red Cross, someone
needs blood every two seconds, and while 38

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.400
percent of the U.S. population could donate
blood, only 10 percent does.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.950
Changing this deferment would mean more blood
for everyone, even if it came from a dude

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.820
who boned another dude, blood is blood is
blood is blood…

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.360
I mean it is, except when it's a different
blood type.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.650
Why do we even have different blood types?

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.110
And what happens if you put A blood into a
B person?

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:45.200
Find out from my blood-buddy Julian, right
here.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:55.900
What do y'all think?

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.150
Should we take all the blood donations we
can and screen later?

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.460
How do you feel about the so-called Blood
Ban?
