if you can summarize their feelings
 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.340
if you can summarize their feelings
about the facts that are driving them

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350
about the facts that are driving them

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.449
but that they're blind to will make a
big difference to them because then they

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459
big difference to them because then they
 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.960
big difference to them because then they
feel really understood that

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970
feel really understood that
 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.330

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340
but the connection is there and they may
 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.340
but the connection is there and they may
actually change their mind about what

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350
actually change their mind about what
 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.480
actually change their mind about what
decisions they've made

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490
decisions they've made
 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.440
decisions they've made
