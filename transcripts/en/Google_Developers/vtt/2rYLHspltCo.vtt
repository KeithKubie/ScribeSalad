Thompson:
Now we're on. Okay.

00:00:04.434 --> 00:00:07.367
Google APIs.

00:00:07.367 --> 00:00:10.601
Imagine trying to deploy

00:00:10.601 --> 00:00:12.701
services like these
on your own.

00:00:12.701 --> 00:00:14.601
The levels of redundancy,

00:00:14.601 --> 00:00:16.167
the years of development.

00:00:16.167 --> 00:00:17.667
I used to struggle
for the budget

00:00:17.667 --> 00:00:18.801
to get a second server,

00:00:18.801 --> 00:00:21.467
even for mission-critical
applications.

00:00:21.467 --> 00:00:22.901
But thousands--

00:00:22.901 --> 00:00:24.334
tens of thousands
of companies

00:00:24.334 --> 00:00:26.601
still operate that way.

00:00:26.601 --> 00:00:29.200
And eventually they'll become
a really huge market

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.501
for transitions to the cloud.

00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:34.067
I've been given
a lot of opportunities

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:36.834
to learn things
while working with Google.

00:00:36.834 --> 00:00:40.567
I've signed some severe
confidentiality agreements.

00:00:40.567 --> 00:00:42.133
I really can't blog anymore.

00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:44.067
Can't publish anything.

00:00:44.067 --> 00:00:46.000
Can't talk in my sleep.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.767
But I can share this.

00:00:47.767 --> 00:00:49.367
I know Google's passionate

00:00:49.367 --> 00:00:52.234
about performance
and reliability.

00:00:52.234 --> 00:00:53.534
If you can come up
with something

00:00:53.534 --> 00:00:55.434
that shaves ten milliseconds
off an operation,

00:00:55.434 --> 00:00:57.000
there's cheers all around.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.567
I've never seen
anything like it.

00:00:58.567 --> 00:01:00.801
So that's one of the reasons

00:01:00.801 --> 00:01:04.534
I would say I think Google's
the long-term best candidate

00:01:04.534 --> 00:01:06.067
to be the cloud,

00:01:06.067 --> 00:01:07.634
their APIs.

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:10.334
There'll be others
in narrow niches,

00:01:10.334 --> 00:01:13.434
but Google
will be the gold standard.

00:01:13.434 --> 00:01:16.234
And learning to make good use
of the Google APIs

00:01:16.234 --> 00:01:18.334
is a competitive advantage,

00:01:18.334 --> 00:01:20.968
'cause right now, for the price
of an email address,

00:01:20.968 --> 00:01:22.534
on App Engine,

00:01:22.534 --> 00:01:25.367
we can have ten
of our own virtual servers.

00:01:25.367 --> 00:01:29.501
Each one can handle
7,400 requests per minute

00:01:29.501 --> 00:01:31.634
through a ten-gig pipeline.

00:01:31.634 --> 00:01:34.200
It's hard to compete
against that kind of--

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.200
it's hard to compete

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.167
with those kinds
of free resources

00:01:37.167 --> 00:01:39.100
if you didn't have them.

00:01:40.968 --> 00:01:42.634
This is a short list

00:01:42.634 --> 00:01:46.667
of what we consider to be
essential API tools.

00:01:49.167 --> 00:01:51.000
For us, the basics
are App Engine,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.167
Base, Gadgets, Maps,
and Spreadsheets.

00:01:55.167 --> 00:01:59.000
If we get good with these,
we can cover a lot of ground.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.667
Probably a lot of you know
these APIs better than I do.

00:02:03.667 --> 00:02:04.934
And I'm not here

00:02:04.934 --> 00:02:06.701
because I'm some kind
of expert on anything.

00:02:06.701 --> 00:02:08.167
I think the reason I'm here

00:02:08.167 --> 00:02:10.367
is 'cause I've been
in the industry so long,

00:02:10.367 --> 00:02:13.067
and I just work really hard,
and I work like crazy.

00:02:13.067 --> 00:02:15.100
So I'm probably
telling you some things--

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.100
Maybe you already knew that.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.801
And hopefully,
there'll be something in here

00:02:19.801 --> 00:02:22.968
that you can take away
that'll be helpful to you.

00:02:22.968 --> 00:02:25.901
But I'll go through it.

00:02:25.901 --> 00:02:28.267
Google Base lets us put

00:02:28.267 --> 00:02:31.567
just about any kind
of content online.

00:02:31.567 --> 00:02:33.834
And, again, for the price
of an email address,

00:02:33.834 --> 00:02:36.934
we can put
1 million records online.

00:02:36.934 --> 00:02:38.901
Lots of major companies

00:02:38.901 --> 00:02:41.334
already have their products
on Google Base.

00:02:41.334 --> 00:02:44.267
So when it's time
to make an ad for them,

00:02:44.267 --> 00:02:45.701
we need to understand

00:02:45.701 --> 00:02:48.534
how to get their items
from Google Base.

00:02:48.534 --> 00:02:51.367
Plenty of clients
still have their own APIs,

00:02:51.367 --> 00:02:55.801
but Base is
an important one to know.

00:02:55.801 --> 00:02:57.801
In my case,

00:02:57.801 --> 00:03:01.434
Google Gadgets
are the most certain way

00:03:01.434 --> 00:03:03.734
to generate traffic.

00:03:03.734 --> 00:03:07.734
Last year--Or last March,
just from Google Gadgets,

00:03:07.734 --> 00:03:11.634
it generated a million visitors
on my Websites,

00:03:11.634 --> 00:03:15.033
over 19 million page views,
and it was all free traffic.

00:03:15.033 --> 00:03:17.033
Didn't have to pay
for any of it.

00:03:17.033 --> 00:03:20.200
Gadgets are also used as ads,

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.367
and we'll look at some examples
of those later.

00:03:23.367 --> 00:03:25.868
Google Maps just keeps getting
better and better.

00:03:25.868 --> 00:03:27.400
After seeing that keynote

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.601
and seeing
the Rasmussens in action,

00:03:29.601 --> 00:03:33.734
I understand why
that's such a good API.

00:03:33.734 --> 00:03:36.801
For me,
Google Spreadsheets

00:03:36.801 --> 00:03:39.100
have become, like,
the Swiss Army Knife

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.901
of applications,

00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:43.200
especially when we need,
like, a quick solution,

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.200
you know,
some small data set.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.667
Just about every client
has somebody

00:03:47.667 --> 00:03:50.901
that knows
how to use a spreadsheet.

00:03:50.901 --> 00:03:54.200
Jerome will go
into a lot more details

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.400
about AdSense
and the affiliates.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.067
YouTube has some
really neat API tricks.

00:04:00.067 --> 00:04:02.901
Picasa, of course,
is great for handling images.

00:04:02.901 --> 00:04:05.667
And Google Friend Connect,
it's about a year old.

00:04:05.667 --> 00:04:09.133
Has anybody ever heard
or used Google Friend Connect?

00:04:09.133 --> 00:04:11.067
I still run into people
who have never heard of it.

00:04:11.067 --> 00:04:14.601
But basically,

00:04:14.601 --> 00:04:17.234
it lets people
join your site,

00:04:17.234 --> 00:04:19.534
and then
you can do persistence,

00:04:19.534 --> 00:04:22.000
you know,
let them rate things,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.667
have polls,

00:04:23.667 --> 00:04:26.167
and it's very easy
to set up and do.

00:04:26.167 --> 00:04:30.167
And they can log in
from other social services

00:04:30.167 --> 00:04:32.767
other than just Google's.

00:04:36.701 --> 00:04:40.367
We've broken monetization down
for our talk today

00:04:40.367 --> 00:04:41.968
into two sections--

00:04:41.968 --> 00:04:45.734
indirect and direct.

00:04:45.734 --> 00:04:48.234
By direct,
we mean people paying us

00:04:48.234 --> 00:04:49.667
to do certain things for them.

00:04:49.667 --> 00:04:50.801
By indirect,

00:04:50.801 --> 00:04:53.067
we mean the AdSense
and affiliate programs.

00:04:53.067 --> 00:04:54.868
We won't be mentioning
some of the others,

00:04:54.868 --> 00:04:56.334
since this is
a Google presentation,

00:04:56.334 --> 00:04:59.000
like Amazon.

00:05:00.834 --> 00:05:02.734
When working
directly for clients,

00:05:02.734 --> 00:05:07.367
it's common to quote
an hourly rate,

00:05:07.367 --> 00:05:10.234
and that's--

00:05:10.234 --> 00:05:12.434
For us, that's a little bit
less attractive,

00:05:12.434 --> 00:05:14.300
because it puts us
in competition

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.267
with every other programmer
in the world directly,

00:05:17.267 --> 00:05:22.234
especially with
the low-cost labor markets.

00:05:22.234 --> 00:05:25.834
When we started making
Gadget ads for Google,

00:05:25.834 --> 00:05:27.868
they did want to pay us
by the hour,

00:05:27.868 --> 00:05:29.567
and it made perfect sense,

00:05:29.567 --> 00:05:31.567
because no one really knew

00:05:31.567 --> 00:05:33.901
how long it would take
to do this.

00:05:33.901 --> 00:05:36.901
We were doing things--
putting things together

00:05:36.901 --> 00:05:40.567
that hadn't been done
quite that way before,

00:05:40.567 --> 00:05:42.400
and one of the first
things I learned

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.968
is there's a huge difference
between making a gadget for fun

00:05:44.968 --> 00:05:47.133
and making an ad.

00:05:47.133 --> 00:05:52.801
An ad, the appearance
is absolutely fixed.

00:05:52.801 --> 00:05:55.601
The tolerance
is plus or minus zero pixels.

00:05:55.601 --> 00:05:57.567
You have to nail it exactly.

00:05:57.567 --> 00:06:01.467
The first project I worked on
was a great one to learn from,

00:06:01.467 --> 00:06:03.701
because it had
some classic challenges.

00:06:03.701 --> 00:06:05.667
I think I was
the third developer.

00:06:05.667 --> 00:06:08.467
I don't know what happened
to the first one.

00:06:08.467 --> 00:06:10.634
The second one
said he was on vacation.

00:06:10.634 --> 00:06:14.300
And the day I started,
we were over budget

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.701
and, like,
four weeks behind.

00:06:17.701 --> 00:06:21.067
And the client
was communication challenged.

00:06:21.067 --> 00:06:23.934
They would burn a whole week
between questions.

00:06:23.934 --> 00:06:26.868
And when the answer
finally arrived,

00:06:26.868 --> 00:06:29.634
it might be one sentence
in all caps--

00:06:29.634 --> 00:06:34.100
"JUST MATCH THE MOCK-UP."

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.334
I also--When we started,

00:06:36.334 --> 00:06:38.567
I tried to let
the Google folks know

00:06:38.567 --> 00:06:40.434
I wasn't sure if I was
really professional enough

00:06:40.434 --> 00:06:42.801
to deal with their clients
directly.

00:06:42.801 --> 00:06:46.901
I'd had about, at that point,
about 25 years experience

00:06:46.901 --> 00:06:49.801
dealing with
the table-pounders in Detroit,

00:06:49.801 --> 00:06:51.501
but I'd never worked
with anybody

00:06:51.501 --> 00:06:53.400
in the advertising
industry before,

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.033
and I imagined it would be
a lot different.

00:06:56.033 --> 00:06:58.200
It turns out clients really--

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.234
or customers really
aren't that different

00:07:00.234 --> 00:07:01.467
in the different industries.

00:07:01.467 --> 00:07:03.934
And in advertising,
there's a lot--

00:07:03.934 --> 00:07:06.501
there's less table pounding.

00:07:06.501 --> 00:07:09.501
One point
about fixed-price bids

00:07:09.501 --> 00:07:12.567
is they make it easier
for people to buy from you.

00:07:12.567 --> 00:07:13.968
You always have to imagine

00:07:13.968 --> 00:07:16.667
what it's like for your contact
to go get approval

00:07:16.667 --> 00:07:18.534
to pay you to do something.

00:07:18.534 --> 00:07:21.868
So if you're talking
in terms of an hourly rate,

00:07:21.868 --> 00:07:24.901
it's almost like asking
for a blank check,

00:07:24.901 --> 00:07:26.701
because, you know,
really don't know how long

00:07:26.701 --> 00:07:28.234
it's gonna take,
and you can just say,

00:07:28.234 --> 00:07:30.000
"Well, not
to exceed this much,"

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.501
or something like that.

00:07:31.501 --> 00:07:34.767
But a fixed-price bid
makes it a lot easier for them

00:07:34.767 --> 00:07:38.701
to go to their vice president

00:07:38.701 --> 00:07:40.901
or whoever has to approve it
and say,

00:07:40.901 --> 00:07:42.868
"Okay, we need X dollars
to do this project."

00:07:42.868 --> 00:07:45.167
And then they can decide,
"Is it really worth it?"

00:07:45.167 --> 00:07:47.767
You know, "Do we want to spend
that money on it?"

00:07:54.367 --> 00:07:56.167
Okay, in our case,

00:07:56.167 --> 00:07:58.467
connecting the markets is,
to me,

00:07:58.467 --> 00:08:02.234
is the hardest part
of having your own business.

00:08:02.234 --> 00:08:06.801
For us, we were really lucky.

00:08:06.801 --> 00:08:08.234
Google reached out to us.

00:08:08.234 --> 00:08:11.634
We had demonstrated
some proficiency with the APIs.

00:08:11.634 --> 00:08:15.167
When the Gadget API was new,

00:08:15.167 --> 00:08:18.334
actually, I started making
some gadgets,

00:08:18.334 --> 00:08:20.133
kind of little games
and fun things,

00:08:20.133 --> 00:08:21.133
to impress my daughters.

00:08:21.133 --> 00:08:23.234
I might spend, like, a month

00:08:23.234 --> 00:08:25.067
working on something,
getting it ready,

00:08:25.067 --> 00:08:29.667
and they would be impressed
for about two minutes.

00:08:29.667 --> 00:08:33.033
But after a while, you know,
it became challenging.

00:08:33.033 --> 00:08:34.133
A lot of times I'd do things,

00:08:34.133 --> 00:08:37.200
you know, "Can I do this?
Can we do that?"

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.200
And I started turning out
one or two gadgets a week.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:46.567
And so when
they decided to, uh...

00:08:46.567 --> 00:08:48.467
try to use Gadgets for ads,

00:08:48.467 --> 00:08:52.100
they reached out to about
8 or 12 of us in that category

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.133
to find out
if we wanted to do it,

00:08:54.133 --> 00:08:57.000
you know, for money,
to do it professionally.

00:08:59.601 --> 00:09:02.400
I think one thing
I'd like to share,

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.601
you know,
throughout my life,

00:09:03.601 --> 00:09:05.033
I've told people that...

00:09:05.033 --> 00:09:08.467
Find what you love to do,
and do it with all your might.

00:09:08.467 --> 00:09:11.033
And success
will follow from that.

00:09:11.033 --> 00:09:13.667
And I think it's true.
It's true in our case.

00:09:13.667 --> 00:09:15.801
I've also--I've--

00:09:15.801 --> 00:09:17.567
Talk about building alliances,

00:09:17.567 --> 00:09:19.534
I've been
in a lot of situations

00:09:19.534 --> 00:09:21.734
where the customer/vendor
relationship

00:09:21.734 --> 00:09:23.834
is adversarial.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.501
Like it's a fight
all the time.

00:09:27.501 --> 00:09:30.434
There's arguments,
dishonesty, and so forth.

00:09:30.434 --> 00:09:33.901
What I found works better
is to try to make an alliance.

00:09:33.901 --> 00:09:37.033
Try to find ways where everybody
comes out a winner,

00:09:37.033 --> 00:09:41.133
and that they're really glad
they did business with you.

00:09:41.133 --> 00:09:43.167
We have to keep
asking ourselves,

00:09:43.167 --> 00:09:46.367
"Given the level
of service we're providing,

00:09:46.367 --> 00:09:48.234
"would this customer

00:09:48.234 --> 00:09:51.100
decide to do business
with us again?"

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.234
The early Gadget ad projects
were really hard for us,

00:09:54.234 --> 00:09:56.067
because we
were putting things together

00:09:56.067 --> 00:09:58.267
in ways
that hadn't been done before.

00:09:58.267 --> 00:10:00.968
Clients would get anxious.

00:10:00.968 --> 00:10:03.267
It would take three or four
tries to get something right.

00:10:03.267 --> 00:10:06.834
I make so many mistakes.

00:10:06.834 --> 00:10:08.667
One time it was late at night,

00:10:08.667 --> 00:10:10.701
and we were working
on something.

00:10:10.701 --> 00:10:13.734
We found out--you know,
we found out what to do,

00:10:13.734 --> 00:10:16.634
and it meant
redoing a lot of code.

00:10:16.634 --> 00:10:18.767
I mean, a lot,
and it was gonna take hours.

00:10:18.767 --> 00:10:22.000
And I was chatting
with the contact at Google,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.567
and I said,
"Okay, I'll start on it now,

00:10:24.567 --> 00:10:26.100
and it'll be ready
in the morning."

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.267
And he chatted back.

00:10:27.267 --> 00:10:29.467
He said,
"You're crazy, aren't you?"

00:10:29.467 --> 00:10:31.501
And of course he was right,

00:10:31.501 --> 00:10:33.567
but I think he meant it
in a good way.

00:10:33.567 --> 00:10:36.400
But that's an example

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.901
of providing service

00:10:37.901 --> 00:10:43.000
above and beyond what
their expectations might be.

00:10:50.834 --> 00:10:53.033
Once you've connected
with the market

00:10:53.033 --> 00:10:56.400
and you start doing
contract work,

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.334
an important point

00:10:58.334 --> 00:11:02.934
is to manage
client expectations.

00:11:02.934 --> 00:11:07.067
I learned that by watching
other people doing that.

00:11:07.067 --> 00:11:08.734
I noticed they were doing that.

00:11:08.734 --> 00:11:10.200
And I think
the important point there

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.667
is you don't want
to set the clients up

00:11:11.667 --> 00:11:13.834
to be disappointed.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:19.000
My natural tendency is to put
the very best spin on things,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.534
and sometimes things
actually do work out

00:11:22.534 --> 00:11:25.133
exactly perfect,
but usually not.

00:11:25.133 --> 00:11:27.801
So it's better not

00:11:27.801 --> 00:11:30.334
to set them up
to be disappointed.

00:11:32.934 --> 00:11:34.868
More often--Oh.

00:11:36.901 --> 00:11:38.033
More often than not,

00:11:38.033 --> 00:11:40.567
the people who decide
to place contracts

00:11:40.567 --> 00:11:42.267
aren't engineers themselves.

00:11:42.267 --> 00:11:45.300
They're probably experts
at something else,

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:49.901
so you have to find out
how to communicate with them

00:11:49.901 --> 00:11:51.901
at their comfort level.

00:11:51.901 --> 00:11:54.000
One time
I was talking to a client,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.868
and I said something
about the URL,

00:11:55.868 --> 00:11:58.734
and he said, "Oh, whoa,
don't get all technical on me."

00:11:58.734 --> 00:12:01.400
So you have to find out
where they're at

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.200
and work there.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.067
I've seen sales guys
shoot themselves in the foot

00:12:06.067 --> 00:12:08.567
by trying to wow the CEO

00:12:08.567 --> 00:12:13.400
with the latest technical terms
and a lot of acronyms.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.901
You know, he or she,

00:12:14.901 --> 00:12:16.734
they're not gonna know
what that means.

00:12:16.734 --> 00:12:18.167
And it just doesn't--

00:12:18.167 --> 00:12:20.834
Bluffing just doesn't work
very well.

00:12:23.734 --> 00:12:25.467
Estimating costs,

00:12:25.467 --> 00:12:29.000
the only way I know to learn
to do it is to practice.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.701
There's kind of
a laundry list there

00:12:31.701 --> 00:12:34.734
of different things
you might think of

00:12:34.734 --> 00:12:36.200
to take into account,

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.367
but the important part
is to practice.

00:12:38.367 --> 00:12:39.567
I practiced estimating

00:12:39.567 --> 00:12:41.234
how long is it gonna take me
to do this

00:12:41.234 --> 00:12:42.567
even when it doesn't matter,

00:12:42.567 --> 00:12:45.133
even if it's a project
I'm doing just for fun.

00:12:45.133 --> 00:12:47.467
And what I found is,

00:12:47.467 --> 00:12:49.100
for me,

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:52.567
about 25% of the total time
of a project,

00:12:52.567 --> 00:12:57.000
about 25% I spent getting
to a working first draft,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.734
and then about 50%
of the time

00:12:59.734 --> 00:13:01.767
is for debugging

00:13:01.767 --> 00:13:04.734
and meeting
all the requirements.

00:13:04.734 --> 00:13:07.400
Sorry.

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.367
And the remaining 25%
is testing.

00:13:10.367 --> 00:13:14.534
And of course, support goes on
till the last user is dead.

00:13:14.534 --> 00:13:18.300
So the best way to learn
to estimate well is to practice.

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:19.901
Last year, one example,

00:13:19.901 --> 00:13:22.167
I missed an estimate
literally by half.

00:13:22.167 --> 00:13:26.067
And there were
some communication issues.

00:13:26.067 --> 00:13:28.567
There were some open-ended areas
in the requirements,

00:13:28.567 --> 00:13:30.234
and the client
interpreted them

00:13:30.234 --> 00:13:32.167
completely differently
than I did.

00:13:32.167 --> 00:13:35.367
So, you know, half pay
is better than no pay.

00:13:35.367 --> 00:13:36.834
At least I got paid for it,

00:13:36.834 --> 00:13:38.434
but the lesson learned

00:13:38.434 --> 00:13:40.334
was to really nail down
the requirements

00:13:40.334 --> 00:13:43.968
as well as I can.

00:13:43.968 --> 00:13:45.267
Scheduling.

00:13:45.267 --> 00:13:46.801
In our case,

00:13:46.801 --> 00:13:49.834
most of the projects
are due yesterday.

00:13:49.834 --> 00:13:51.901
So really all you can do

00:13:51.901 --> 00:13:55.100
is level the work
as best you can.

00:14:01.133 --> 00:14:02.934
Selling.

00:14:02.934 --> 00:14:04.367
You know,
people will give you--

00:14:04.367 --> 00:14:07.334
There's all kind of seminars
and books about selling.

00:14:07.334 --> 00:14:09.767
They'll give you all kinds
of advice about it.

00:14:09.767 --> 00:14:11.801
So don't take my word for it.

00:14:11.801 --> 00:14:14.033
Shop around.
See what really works for you.

00:14:14.033 --> 00:14:16.400
But this is what's always
worked for me.

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.334
For me,
the most important thing

00:14:18.334 --> 00:14:21.734
is to be absolutely,
totally honest with clients.

00:14:21.734 --> 00:14:25.234
I've been in situations
where my boss, you know,

00:14:25.234 --> 00:14:28.033
at times in my job
would really want me to lie.

00:14:28.033 --> 00:14:29.567
They'd say,
"Okay, the lie is...

00:14:29.567 --> 00:14:31.067
This is what
we're gonna tell them."

00:14:31.067 --> 00:14:32.667
And I would never
go along with that.

00:14:32.667 --> 00:14:35.000
I've actually been fired
for not going along with that.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.467
But I think people are glad
to do business with me

00:14:38.467 --> 00:14:40.234
once they learn that about me,

00:14:40.234 --> 00:14:44.601
that I'm not
gonna fake them out.

00:14:44.601 --> 00:14:46.667
Communicating clearly
is important.

00:14:46.667 --> 00:14:49.000
I wish I were doing better
at it right now,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.934
but, uh...

00:14:50.934 --> 00:14:52.934
I think we've covered
that point.

00:14:52.934 --> 00:14:54.868
I can give you, uh...

00:14:57.734 --> 00:15:00.200
One important point
I want to make

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:03.501
from this slide...

00:15:03.501 --> 00:15:04.701
And we heard it this morning.

00:15:04.701 --> 00:15:06.400
You know, they were talking
about that Wave,

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.133
really cool stuff.

00:15:08.133 --> 00:15:10.601
And we get to see it today

00:15:10.601 --> 00:15:13.400
before it's, like,
even in an alpha release.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.434
So, in my mind,
what I'm thinking is,

00:15:16.434 --> 00:15:17.634
"Oh, this is great.

00:15:17.634 --> 00:15:20.334
"I can be ready
when our customers arrive.

00:15:20.334 --> 00:15:21.767
"I'll--I'll be prepared.

00:15:21.767 --> 00:15:24.367
"I'll understand how to do it,
how to work with it."

00:15:24.367 --> 00:15:25.868
So the point is,

00:15:25.868 --> 00:15:29.400
figure out what
your customers need next year

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.868
and start
preparing for that now.

00:15:37.901 --> 00:15:40.234
The point about learning
what the market will bear

00:15:40.234 --> 00:15:42.300
and bid at or just below that--

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:43.601
just a quick point--

00:15:43.601 --> 00:15:45.667
I don't want to be
the lowest bidder,

00:15:45.667 --> 00:15:47.067
unless it's
a government project.

00:15:47.067 --> 00:15:51.334
I'd rather be
the preferred bidder.

00:15:58.734 --> 00:16:00.667
Which projects to tackle?

00:16:00.667 --> 00:16:03.734
As work starts to, uh...

00:16:03.734 --> 00:16:06.601
As you start to get more
opportunities to bid on work,

00:16:06.601 --> 00:16:09.901
you have to decide what
you really want to go after

00:16:09.901 --> 00:16:11.667
and what you don't.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.367
So kind of the questions
we would go through--

00:16:16.367 --> 00:16:19.067
"Is this project
in our niche?"

00:16:19.067 --> 00:16:21.334
Meaning, we're gonna give it--
if it is,

00:16:21.334 --> 00:16:23.400
we're gonna give it
the most aggressive price

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.100
and the shortest lead time.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.868
It's something--
You know, we know how to do it,

00:16:26.868 --> 00:16:30.167
and we can do it as well
or better than anybody else.

00:16:30.167 --> 00:16:32.701
If the project
is close to what we--

00:16:32.701 --> 00:16:34.801
close to our niche,
in the neighborhood,

00:16:34.801 --> 00:16:36.434
then it's similar.

00:16:36.434 --> 00:16:39.367
You know, we'll try to come in
with a really good price

00:16:39.367 --> 00:16:41.234
and a decent lead time.

00:16:41.234 --> 00:16:43.934
If it's something we'd
really like to start doing,

00:16:43.934 --> 00:16:46.167
you could consider
buying the business,

00:16:46.167 --> 00:16:47.868
you know,
almost give it away,

00:16:47.868 --> 00:16:50.767
just to get the experience
at doing it.

00:16:50.767 --> 00:16:53.300
And some projects,

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:55.300
if you see there's something
frightening about it,

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:57.801
sometimes it's hard
to tell the client,

00:16:57.801 --> 00:16:59.567
"No, I don't want
to bid on that."

00:16:59.567 --> 00:17:02.300
It depends on your
relationship with them,

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:04.334
but you may not be
in a position

00:17:04.334 --> 00:17:06.234
where it's comfortable
to say no,

00:17:06.234 --> 00:17:09.367
so what we've done at times is

00:17:09.367 --> 00:17:11.133
maybe say, "Okay, yes,

00:17:11.133 --> 00:17:13.868
but we'll bid just
on this part of the project."

00:17:13.868 --> 00:17:16.267
Or, "Yes, but here's
our price."

00:17:16.267 --> 00:17:19.300
And the price is set such that
if we do get it, okay.

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:21.767
We won't mind too much.

00:17:24.801 --> 00:17:25.801
I don't know.

00:17:25.801 --> 00:17:27.234
You know,
everybody here, I guess,

00:17:27.234 --> 00:17:29.367
you know, you have a job,
you're working for somebody,

00:17:29.367 --> 00:17:31.634
or maybe you're working
for yourself.

00:17:31.634 --> 00:17:35.434
Somebody we'll call
an astute observer of patterns

00:17:35.434 --> 00:17:39.534
pointed this set of transitions
out to me.

00:17:39.534 --> 00:17:41.033
You know, starting off,

00:17:41.033 --> 00:17:43.033
you're, like, somebody
that's just a programmer,

00:17:43.033 --> 00:17:46.167
doing things because
they're interesting or fun.

00:17:46.167 --> 00:17:48.100
At that stage,

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.667
you don't want to worry so much
about the monetization angle.

00:17:50.667 --> 00:17:53.400
You know, you make money
accidentally,

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.868
or if you have to somehow,

00:17:55.868 --> 00:17:58.067
you know, through AdSense
or whatever.

00:17:58.067 --> 00:18:00.167
Then, as a developer,

00:18:00.167 --> 00:18:02.801
you start to do things

00:18:02.801 --> 00:18:05.434
where some problem
you have solved,

00:18:05.434 --> 00:18:07.734
because it was interesting,

00:18:07.734 --> 00:18:11.734
that solution you provided
will help somebody else,

00:18:11.734 --> 00:18:13.901
and they'll be willing to pay
for that solution.

00:18:13.901 --> 00:18:15.734
So in those,

00:18:15.734 --> 00:18:19.234
you can start picking up
some momentum that way.

00:18:19.234 --> 00:18:22.067
Then once you've done that
for a while,

00:18:22.067 --> 00:18:25.234
you feel like, "Okay,
this is getting more serious."

00:18:25.234 --> 00:18:28.400
And it becomes very important

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.367
to cultivate repeat business
at that point.

00:18:31.367 --> 00:18:33.901
I want to tell one story.

00:18:33.901 --> 00:18:35.801
I was working with a client,

00:18:35.801 --> 00:18:39.234
and they fielded, like,
five different Gadget ads,

00:18:39.234 --> 00:18:42.868
you know, kind of all across
the map possibilities.

00:18:42.868 --> 00:18:45.067
And they ran those
for about a month,

00:18:45.067 --> 00:18:48.400
and then they picked
one winner of the five

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.901
and said, "Okay,
we're gonna go with this one."

00:18:50.901 --> 00:18:53.968
And then they ran it
for about a month,

00:18:53.968 --> 00:18:55.767
and they decided
they wanted to make a change.

00:18:55.767 --> 00:18:57.734
The way their ads
were structured,

00:18:57.734 --> 00:19:00.634
there was four different topics

00:19:00.634 --> 00:19:04.567
and, uh...

00:19:04.567 --> 00:19:05.901
eight different sizes,

00:19:05.901 --> 00:19:07.601
so the change they needed

00:19:07.601 --> 00:19:09.767
was gonna hit
32 different places.

00:19:09.767 --> 00:19:11.601
So they wrote an email,
you know,

00:19:11.601 --> 00:19:13.133
"How long is this gonna take?

00:19:13.133 --> 00:19:15.934
How much is it gonna cost?
Is it difficult?"

00:19:15.934 --> 00:19:18.934
And the actual change
they needed

00:19:18.934 --> 00:19:21.567
was one of those
one-line-of-code-type changes.

00:19:21.567 --> 00:19:25.901
And I responded, I said,

00:19:25.901 --> 00:19:28.234
"It's done. No charge."

00:19:28.234 --> 00:19:29.534
You know,
it took about a minute.

00:19:29.534 --> 00:19:31.467
And I already had
a program in place

00:19:31.467 --> 00:19:33.167
to handle the repetitive stuff.

00:19:33.167 --> 00:19:36.267
And I think they were shocked
that that was the answer.

00:19:36.267 --> 00:19:38.267
"It's done,
and there's no charge?"

00:19:38.267 --> 00:19:42.467
And what they learned
about us at that point

00:19:42.467 --> 00:19:45.267
was--is that we weren't
gonna take advantage of them

00:19:45.267 --> 00:19:46.534
on some little something.

00:19:46.534 --> 00:19:49.334
They believe us when we say--
And so now when we say,

00:19:49.334 --> 00:19:51.734
"That change is gonna cost
several thousand dollars,"

00:19:51.734 --> 00:19:53.167
they believe it,

00:19:53.167 --> 00:19:54.968
'cause they know we're
gonna tell them the truth

00:19:54.968 --> 00:19:58.067
about the ones
that are really trivial.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:06.234
And they've become
our second-biggest customer.

00:20:06.234 --> 00:20:09.868
And actually,
I think if anybody else--

00:20:09.868 --> 00:20:12.400
IBM or whoever, you know--
went to them and said,

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.501
"Okay, we can do
what Echo3 is doing,"

00:20:14.501 --> 00:20:17.334
it'd be a really
hard sell for them.

00:20:17.334 --> 00:20:20.968
You know, we've really
developed some loyalty.

00:20:24.367 --> 00:20:26.400
This is kind of a short list

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:30.133
of some lessons learned.

00:20:30.133 --> 00:20:31.801
The example I just gave,

00:20:31.801 --> 00:20:34.334
using software
to automate repetitive tasks,

00:20:34.334 --> 00:20:35.901
you can see
where that helped.

00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:38.067
And we told the story
about looking out

00:20:38.067 --> 00:20:41.033
for open-ended statements
and requirements.

00:20:41.033 --> 00:20:43.200
One way I shoot myself
in the foot,

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.200
I try to turn things around
really quickly.

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:55.501
Recently, I published
a really big bug

00:20:55.501 --> 00:20:57.501
in kind of
a high-profile project,

00:20:57.501 --> 00:20:58.634
and you know what?

00:20:58.634 --> 00:21:00.300
It tested, it looked okay
and everything,

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:03.501
but I realized I was looking
at some cached results.

00:21:03.501 --> 00:21:05.901
And so, anyway,

00:21:05.901 --> 00:21:08.734
there's no such thing
as too much testing.

00:21:08.734 --> 00:21:11.501
Sometimes with clients,
you know,

00:21:11.501 --> 00:21:15.601
they'll want to,
say, do a new ad,

00:21:15.601 --> 00:21:17.601
and they want
to talk about it on the phone,

00:21:17.601 --> 00:21:18.767
and while you're talking--

00:21:18.767 --> 00:21:20.667
you haven't even seen
a mock-up yet.

00:21:20.667 --> 00:21:22.234
"Can you give me
a quick estimate?

00:21:22.234 --> 00:21:24.200
You know, some kind
of ballpark thing?"

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.734
So one thing I found is,

00:21:25.734 --> 00:21:28.167
if I think something's
gonna take me three days,

00:21:28.167 --> 00:21:29.834
I should say six days.

00:21:29.834 --> 00:21:32.267
And if they want to say,
"Well, worse case."

00:21:32.267 --> 00:21:35.467
So for me,
I multiply that by four.

00:21:35.467 --> 00:21:37.601
And the last part--

00:21:37.601 --> 00:21:41.667
they told me to use a picture.

00:21:41.667 --> 00:21:44.501
One thing I found, I think
I've blown some business

00:21:44.501 --> 00:21:45.968
by using rough drafts.

00:21:45.968 --> 00:21:48.234
I don't have any problem
with a rough draft.

00:21:48.234 --> 00:21:49.400
You know, "I get it.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.300
Okay, yeah, the images
will look better later."

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:52.667
And,
"We're gonna have somebody

00:21:52.667 --> 00:21:54.834
that's really good with graphics
come back and do this."

00:21:54.834 --> 00:21:57.934
But one lesson learned
is use a wire frame.

00:21:57.934 --> 00:22:01.234
Some people just aren't--
they're not gonna play with you.

00:22:01.234 --> 00:22:02.801
They're not
gonna be that imaginative

00:22:02.801 --> 00:22:05.167
about how this might look.

00:22:05.167 --> 00:22:09.701
And the big warm-up
for Jerome coming up now,

00:22:09.701 --> 00:22:12.501
you'll be glad to hear.

00:22:12.501 --> 00:22:14.567
Talking about Gadget ads
a lot.

00:22:14.567 --> 00:22:17.167
These are some of the typical
Gadget ad features,

00:22:17.167 --> 00:22:20.334
that they're contextual...

00:22:22.601 --> 00:22:25.501
And I'm sure everybody here
understands that concept.

00:22:25.501 --> 00:22:27.267
Geo-awareness

00:22:27.267 --> 00:22:30.400
is becoming more and more
important with ads.

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:33.234
I'm not supposed to mention
certain client names,

00:22:33.234 --> 00:22:34.567
but, for example,

00:22:34.567 --> 00:22:38.267
there's one very large
online auction company

00:22:38.267 --> 00:22:42.801
that sells cars online,

00:22:42.801 --> 00:22:45.400
and they, of course,

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.167
you know,
when somebody buys a car,

00:22:47.167 --> 00:22:49.801
they don't want to drive
six hours to pick it up.

00:22:49.801 --> 00:22:52.234
They want something
in their location.

00:22:52.234 --> 00:22:55.501
So, uh...

00:22:55.501 --> 00:22:59.133
the ads
from the AdWords network

00:22:59.133 --> 00:23:01.467
are given these parameters--

00:23:01.467 --> 00:23:04.267
city, region,
or latitude and longitude.

00:23:04.267 --> 00:23:07.834
It's getting easier and easier
to find out where the user is.

00:23:07.834 --> 00:23:10.767
Gadget ads typically

00:23:10.767 --> 00:23:14.334
have to query a custom API
or Google Base

00:23:14.334 --> 00:23:16.200
with--you know,
probably with a keyword,

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.300
and then obviously
it has to display something,

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:22.701
you know, the items, the image,
or where it's located.

00:23:22.701 --> 00:23:26.567
And Jerome's gonna
take it from here, so...

00:23:26.567 --> 00:23:28.634
Mouton:
Thank you, Michael.

00:23:28.634 --> 00:23:30.534
So, yeah,
as Michael mentioned,

00:23:30.534 --> 00:23:33.968
usually we cannot show or tell
what the customer ask.

00:23:33.968 --> 00:23:36.601
The Google account team
for kayak.com

00:23:36.601 --> 00:23:39.801
was nice enough to get us
permission to show you this one.

00:23:39.801 --> 00:23:43.067
So as Michael mentioned--
And I'll use the mouse,

00:23:43.067 --> 00:23:46.100
because pointing at both screens
will be difficult.

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.501
Oops.
Oh, don't start making--

00:23:48.501 --> 00:23:50.367
Okay.
So this is a Gadget ad.

00:23:50.367 --> 00:23:52.634
So, you know,
be a bit imaginative.

00:23:52.634 --> 00:23:56.467
Picture that to be on a review
Website, for example.

00:23:56.467 --> 00:23:59.734
You are on the Website
talking about museum in Paris,

00:23:59.734 --> 00:24:02.901
and you have this banner ad
showing on top.

00:24:02.901 --> 00:24:06.834
So as Michael mentioned,
we have the geoinformation

00:24:06.834 --> 00:24:08.601
about where you, the user, is.

00:24:08.601 --> 00:24:11.567
So in this case, we know you
are close to San Francisco,

00:24:11.567 --> 00:24:13.667
so what the Gadget ad
is doing--

00:24:13.667 --> 00:24:16.267
we find the closest airport

00:24:16.267 --> 00:24:19.601
from a database
from where you are.

00:24:19.601 --> 00:24:22.667
Probably that as a "From,"
a destination.

00:24:22.667 --> 00:24:26.200
For the target destination,
you know, we have keywords

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:29.133
from the context of the page,
and here in this case,

00:24:29.133 --> 00:24:30.367
it would trigger

00:24:30.367 --> 00:24:32.834
that you're on a page
talking about Paris.

00:24:32.834 --> 00:24:35.634
And with this information,
contextual data,

00:24:35.634 --> 00:24:38.934
we can go and query
the kayak.com APIs

00:24:38.934 --> 00:24:42.067
and find what other good deals
they have in their listing

00:24:42.067 --> 00:24:45.868
with from and to Paris.

00:24:45.868 --> 00:24:49.601
And what is pretty cool
with this type of work

00:24:49.601 --> 00:24:52.634
is we provide them with value
to the user as well.

00:24:52.634 --> 00:24:54.901
You are on the Website,
learning about Paris,

00:24:54.901 --> 00:24:56.934
about, you know, cool stuff
you could do over there.

00:24:56.934 --> 00:24:58.501
If we show you information

00:24:58.501 --> 00:25:00.501
that you can get a ticket
for this price,

00:25:00.501 --> 00:25:02.868
it's probably
some valuable data for you.

00:25:02.868 --> 00:25:06.334
And, of course,
for the customer, for Kayak,

00:25:06.334 --> 00:25:07.767
it's also very valuable,

00:25:07.767 --> 00:25:10.868
because you're more likely
to interact with this type of ad

00:25:10.868 --> 00:25:14.567
than with just some text
that is not really contextual.

00:25:14.567 --> 00:25:16.334
So it's just an example.

00:25:16.334 --> 00:25:18.834
We've been doing a couple
of design of those.

00:25:18.834 --> 00:25:21.634
Again, if we were to tell you
about some of those,

00:25:21.634 --> 00:25:22.901
we'd have to kill you,

00:25:22.901 --> 00:25:26.567
so it would not be very pleasant
for this demonstration.

00:25:26.567 --> 00:25:28.968
So Michael
discussed extensively

00:25:28.968 --> 00:25:31.801
about what we've done
for concerting, contracting.

00:25:31.801 --> 00:25:35.234
We've been also doing
different type of work

00:25:35.234 --> 00:25:37.434
in the past few years,

00:25:37.434 --> 00:25:40.501
and especially creating
our own products.

00:25:40.501 --> 00:25:41.968
In fact,
that's how we started.

00:25:41.968 --> 00:25:44.567
We've been very active
in the iGoogle scene,

00:25:44.567 --> 00:25:47.367
creating gadgets for
your personalized home pages.

00:25:47.367 --> 00:25:48.834
And when you do that,

00:25:48.834 --> 00:25:50.901
what is pretty cool
is you don't have

00:25:50.901 --> 00:25:53.200
a customer
telling you what to do.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.734
It's, you know, your own idea
that you can implement.

00:25:55.734 --> 00:25:57.133
You can be creative.

00:25:57.133 --> 00:26:01.767
The issue, then, we want
to monetize on these ideas.

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:07.400
So the concept
is very different, right?

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:10.067
Nobody will be paying the bill
for you to develop the product,

00:26:10.067 --> 00:26:11.534
so you have
to invest some time.

00:26:11.534 --> 00:26:12.801
But it plays very well

00:26:12.801 --> 00:26:14.634
when you're doing
concerting or contracting,

00:26:14.634 --> 00:26:16.067
because you'll have
some downtime.

00:26:16.067 --> 00:26:19.400
For some weeks, you won't have
any concerting to do.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:22.300
That's a very good time
to reapply techniques

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:24.000
you learned
on customer projects,

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.634
or to learn
on new technologies

00:26:27.634 --> 00:26:30.701
you can try
to do your own products.

00:26:30.701 --> 00:26:33.501
So we discussed two main ways
of monetizing

00:26:33.501 --> 00:26:36.100
using your ad networks
like AdSense,

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:37.601
which is pay-per-click,

00:26:37.601 --> 00:26:40.467
PPC, and the other one
we look at as well

00:26:40.467 --> 00:26:43.067
is using affiliate marketing
where you create some links

00:26:43.067 --> 00:26:45.467
to some products
on some retail Website,

00:26:45.467 --> 00:26:48.133
and you get paid
for customer action

00:26:48.133 --> 00:26:50.167
if they buy something

00:26:50.167 --> 00:26:54.100
or if they sign up
or something like that.

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:57.067
Okay, so let's focus first
on iGoogle

00:26:57.067 --> 00:26:59.467
and what we've been
learning and doing

00:26:59.467 --> 00:27:01.133
for these past few years.

00:27:01.133 --> 00:27:03.267
The main issue
you have on iGoogle,

00:27:03.267 --> 00:27:05.968
you don't have a full Web page
to play with.

00:27:05.968 --> 00:27:08.834
You have a very small,
concentrated space,

00:27:08.834 --> 00:27:11.267
and you are competing with
millions of gadgets all around,

00:27:11.267 --> 00:27:14.801
so the best way to monetize
on the iGoogle Gadget

00:27:14.801 --> 00:27:17.067
is to do that elsewhere.

00:27:17.067 --> 00:27:19.701
In many situation,
you'll be doing a gadget

00:27:19.701 --> 00:27:23.234
because you have a blog
or some content on a Website,

00:27:23.234 --> 00:27:25.601
and you just want
to allow your users

00:27:25.601 --> 00:27:27.434
to syndicate your content

00:27:27.434 --> 00:27:30.601
and to see what you have new
when they visit iGoogle.

00:27:30.601 --> 00:27:34.701
When you do that, you know,
the user will be, you know,

00:27:34.701 --> 00:27:36.734
more reminded
about your content

00:27:36.734 --> 00:27:38.334
through the day
when they visit iGoogle,

00:27:38.334 --> 00:27:40.100
and you will get
some crazy traffic

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:41.934
from iGoogle to your site.

00:27:41.934 --> 00:27:44.634
Something else
that is pretty cool with that

00:27:44.634 --> 00:27:47.567
is once you have enough users
using your gadget,

00:27:47.567 --> 00:27:50.601
and they are leaving good
comments about your gadget,

00:27:50.601 --> 00:27:54.234
you will be ranked pretty good
in the directory,

00:27:54.234 --> 00:27:56.734
meaning new users
will find your, you know,

00:27:56.734 --> 00:27:58.467
your tool, your content,

00:27:58.467 --> 00:28:00.868
and you're pretty likely
to get more users.

00:28:00.868 --> 00:28:03.334
More users,
more traffic, more money.

00:28:03.334 --> 00:28:06.067
So, yeah, again,
if you have a Website

00:28:06.067 --> 00:28:08.767
where you can monetize,
let's take this approach.

00:28:08.767 --> 00:28:11.634
Monetize on the full page
of your content of your blog,

00:28:11.634 --> 00:28:15.601
and just do the gadget
to get some traffic.

00:28:15.601 --> 00:28:16.801
We'll talk in a few seconds

00:28:16.801 --> 00:28:18.534
about how to monetize
in a gadget,

00:28:18.534 --> 00:28:20.901
which is more tricky.

00:28:20.901 --> 00:28:22.901
But quick tips for iGoogle.

00:28:22.901 --> 00:28:24.501
You know,
what we found works well

00:28:24.501 --> 00:28:26.701
is don't try to do something
too big at first.

00:28:26.701 --> 00:28:27.968
Try to find a niche,

00:28:27.968 --> 00:28:32.601
and be good at doing
these little, small specialties.

00:28:32.601 --> 00:28:34.200
And then
you can always expand.

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:35.701
That's always easy to do.

00:28:35.701 --> 00:28:37.968
Something else
also to consider,

00:28:37.968 --> 00:28:40.267
when you are just
starting development,

00:28:40.267 --> 00:28:41.934
playing with these type
of technologies,

00:28:41.934 --> 00:28:44.234
you know,
you're playing, right?

00:28:44.234 --> 00:28:45.767
But once you start monetizing,

00:28:45.767 --> 00:28:48.801
the users you will get
become your customers,

00:28:48.801 --> 00:28:50.901
that thanks to these people,
you will be making some money,

00:28:50.901 --> 00:28:52.834
so treat them as such,
you know?

00:28:52.834 --> 00:28:54.601
Listen to what
they have to say.

00:28:54.601 --> 00:28:57.300
Make sure that they have
a way to email you,

00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:00.200
to contact you with
some feedback, some questions.

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:02.267
Also, you know,
you have to monitor

00:29:02.267 --> 00:29:04.100
the Web pages and the directory

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:06.067
where they can
post comment and rating,

00:29:06.067 --> 00:29:08.234
and try to, you know,
on a regular basis,

00:29:08.234 --> 00:29:09.234
reply to that, you know.

00:29:09.234 --> 00:29:10.734
If they have questions,
answer them.

00:29:10.734 --> 00:29:13.701
If you have concerns or so,
address that.

00:29:13.701 --> 00:29:16.200
I think it's very important
to be successful.

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.033
These users
are your customers,

00:29:18.033 --> 00:29:19.934
so take good care of them.

00:29:19.934 --> 00:29:21.567
So let's now discuss

00:29:21.567 --> 00:29:24.033
about how to monetize
inside the gadget.

00:29:24.033 --> 00:29:26.167
So we'll go through
a few examples.

00:29:26.167 --> 00:29:28.501
This first one is one
of the first I developed.

00:29:28.501 --> 00:29:29.501
It's a wall clock.

00:29:29.501 --> 00:29:31.534
You know,
it became very popular.

00:29:31.534 --> 00:29:33.968
On this one,

00:29:33.968 --> 00:29:37.234
I've been using AdSense
as a way to monetize.

00:29:37.234 --> 00:29:39.734
So, you know, AdSense,
the way it works,

00:29:39.734 --> 00:29:40.934
it looks at the context,

00:29:40.934 --> 00:29:43.167
the keywords around,
you know, the content,

00:29:43.167 --> 00:29:44.400
and find something relevant.

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:48.100
If you've been using AdSense
on Websites

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:50.767
and you stop using AdSense
on a gadget,

00:29:50.767 --> 00:29:53.033
you'll be probably
very shocked at first

00:29:53.033 --> 00:29:55.200
to see the CTR,
the click through rate,

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:56.934
it's extremely low.

00:29:56.934 --> 00:29:59.334
On the Website,
usually you see a few percent

00:29:59.334 --> 00:30:01.968
of the impression
convert to a click.

00:30:01.968 --> 00:30:03.601
On AdSense at first,

00:30:03.601 --> 00:30:05.667
you know,
I was very surprised to see

00:30:05.667 --> 00:30:08.934
that we have a number
of about 0.05%.

00:30:08.934 --> 00:30:11.100
So, yeah,
it's very, very low.

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:13.567
But when you think about it,
it makes sense.

00:30:13.567 --> 00:30:17.067
On iGoogle, you have
so much content on the page,

00:30:17.067 --> 00:30:18.567
you don't have the user focused

00:30:18.567 --> 00:30:20.901
on your specific gadget
all the time.

00:30:20.901 --> 00:30:22.601
Even worse than that,
you know,

00:30:22.601 --> 00:30:25.067
you can have
your gadget positioned

00:30:25.067 --> 00:30:26.767
below, you know, the page.

00:30:26.767 --> 00:30:28.667
You have to scroll down
to see it,

00:30:28.667 --> 00:30:29.968
meaning most of the time,

00:30:29.968 --> 00:30:32.567
the user won't see
your gadget or your ad.

00:30:32.567 --> 00:30:35.033
Something else
to keep in mind as well,

00:30:35.033 --> 00:30:38.067
most users,
they keep the iGoogle page

00:30:38.067 --> 00:30:40.534
up all day long,

00:30:40.534 --> 00:30:43.968
and you probably notice
that every seven or ten minutes,

00:30:43.968 --> 00:30:46.601
the page refreshes by itself,

00:30:46.601 --> 00:30:49.067
meaning you will generate
many, many impression

00:30:49.067 --> 00:30:50.968
when nobody's
looking at the page.

00:30:50.968 --> 00:30:52.767
So that's what explains
this low CTR.

00:30:52.767 --> 00:30:54.601
So nothing
to be concerned about.

00:30:54.601 --> 00:30:56.667
That's the way it is.

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:00.767
Okay.

00:31:00.767 --> 00:31:02.267
Just to give you
some guidelines...

00:31:02.267 --> 00:31:04.000
I don't know
if it's that useful,

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.334
but what we've been saying
for monetization,

00:31:06.334 --> 00:31:10.634
you can expect to get
about 15 bucks per month

00:31:10.634 --> 00:31:12.267
per thousand users.

00:31:12.267 --> 00:31:14.968
When we talk
a thousand users,

00:31:14.968 --> 00:31:17.100
you know,
it will be active users.

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:19.234
If you look
in your analytics account,

00:31:19.234 --> 00:31:21.934
you know, they show you
the evolution per day.

00:31:21.934 --> 00:31:23.300
Kind of takes the peak,

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:28.400
and you can assume that the peak
is your active user base.

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:29.701
Okay?

00:31:29.701 --> 00:31:32.467
This number is, of course,
it's a ballpark figure.

00:31:32.467 --> 00:31:34.701
If you have a gadget
with some content

00:31:34.701 --> 00:31:37.234
that match very
high-paying keywords,

00:31:37.234 --> 00:31:38.834
you may see something
better than we do.

00:31:38.834 --> 00:31:40.801
Good for you.

00:31:40.801 --> 00:31:42.534
But some--
I think some people,

00:31:42.534 --> 00:31:44.133
as you can see,
something less than that.

00:31:44.133 --> 00:31:47.300
It's just probably an average.

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:49.000
All right.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.968
Google released
not that long ago

00:31:50.968 --> 00:31:53.501
the canvas view for iGoogle.

00:31:53.501 --> 00:31:57.000
So that's a pretty
powerful feature.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.100
If you have a gadget
and need more space,

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:02.033
you can define
an alternate view,

00:32:02.033 --> 00:32:04.067
which will be using
kind of a full page.

00:32:04.067 --> 00:32:06.000
You still have
the Google logo on top

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.467
and a sidebar
on the left-hand side,

00:32:08.467 --> 00:32:11.200
but you have much more
real estate to play with.

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.400
That's an example
from LabPixies.

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:15.300
It's one of the top
developers for iGoogle,

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:17.434
and they've made
very good use of that.

00:32:17.434 --> 00:32:19.033
They have a little game

00:32:19.033 --> 00:32:21.901
that on the iGoogle page
is just a small image.

00:32:21.901 --> 00:32:23.601
You cannot
do anything with it.

00:32:23.601 --> 00:32:24.934
But when you click on it,

00:32:24.934 --> 00:32:27.400
it opens a full-time view--
full-screen view,

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:28.767
and they show you the game

00:32:28.767 --> 00:32:31.968
plus some big-size ad
on the side.

00:32:31.968 --> 00:32:36.200
We can implement that,
continue with that user.

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:39.567
You know,
but I'm pretty sure

00:32:39.567 --> 00:32:41.667
it's working
pretty well for them.

00:32:41.667 --> 00:32:44.400
It's probably about, you know,
the same as a Web page.

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:46.767
On the other hand,
the user will see the ad

00:32:46.767 --> 00:32:48.367
only when they interact
with the gadget.

00:32:48.367 --> 00:32:52.501
So we're pretty much back
to when you have a gadget

00:32:52.501 --> 00:32:54.300
driving traffic
to your Website.

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:56.701
Another example
I wanted to show you

00:32:56.701 --> 00:32:58.501
is using affiliate links.

00:32:58.501 --> 00:33:00.167
So it's a small gadget

00:33:00.167 --> 00:33:02.334
that's designed
just for fun at first.

00:33:02.334 --> 00:33:03.934
I'm a big fan of woot.com.

00:33:03.934 --> 00:33:07.100
I like to see every day,
every morning,

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:10.167
what they are selling,
so I designed this small gadget,

00:33:10.167 --> 00:33:11.601
and it started working
pretty well,

00:33:11.601 --> 00:33:13.968
so I was thinking,
"How can I monetize?"

00:33:13.968 --> 00:33:15.200
And at the time,

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.634
I already had the wall clocks
with AdSense.

00:33:17.634 --> 00:33:19.701
And even though
it was working well,

00:33:19.701 --> 00:33:21.267
I was still getting,
you know,

00:33:21.267 --> 00:33:24.334
weekly hate emails from users,
saying, you know,

00:33:24.334 --> 00:33:26.934
"It's dirty. Don't put AdSense
on iGoogle," you know.

00:33:26.934 --> 00:33:28.167
People don't like it
that much.

00:33:28.167 --> 00:33:29.801
Of course,
it takes up real estate.

00:33:29.801 --> 00:33:34.567
So I wanted to experiment
with something different.

00:33:34.567 --> 00:33:37.567
You know, I thought
because woot.com customer,

00:33:37.567 --> 00:33:38.934
I know them pretty well.

00:33:38.934 --> 00:33:39.968
They are in the U.S.

00:33:39.968 --> 00:33:42.067
They are people
who like technologies.

00:33:42.067 --> 00:33:44.734
If I can show you
some product

00:33:44.734 --> 00:33:47.667
on Amazon, buy.com,
or you name it,

00:33:47.667 --> 00:33:49.234
they'll probably be interested.

00:33:49.234 --> 00:33:51.467
You know, if I find
the good deals of the moment,

00:33:51.467 --> 00:33:53.601
that will be
good value for them.

00:33:53.601 --> 00:33:56.000
So I started building that
manually every day,

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.501
finding products
and putting links up there.

00:33:58.501 --> 00:34:02.000
And these links are created
through their affiliate Website

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.067
of, you know, as I mentioned,
Amazon or others.

00:34:05.067 --> 00:34:07.234
So when someone
click on the link,

00:34:07.234 --> 00:34:09.334
and if the customer later on

00:34:09.334 --> 00:34:12.033
buy a product on the site
I'm sending them to,

00:34:12.033 --> 00:34:13.067
we get a commission

00:34:13.067 --> 00:34:16.167
ranging from 1% to 8%,
roughly.

00:34:16.167 --> 00:34:18.567
What is, you know,

00:34:18.567 --> 00:34:20.100
I think
is a good takeaway from that

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:22.334
is I never had anybody

00:34:22.334 --> 00:34:25.501
complain about this type
of advertising in a gadget.

00:34:25.501 --> 00:34:27.033
It's small.
It's looking pretty nice.

00:34:27.033 --> 00:34:30.033
So--But two years
I've been doing that,

00:34:30.033 --> 00:34:32.567
and never receive
a single email from anybody.

00:34:32.567 --> 00:34:34.100
On the other hand,

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:36.300
the revenue
is not as good either.

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:39.400
You know,
doing this type of work,

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:44.400
I'm getting about $2 to $3
per month per thousand users.

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:45.901
But I think, you know,

00:34:45.901 --> 00:34:49.234
at least the look and feel
is good, and the user are happy,

00:34:49.234 --> 00:34:51.267
so I think
it's a good drawback.

00:34:51.267 --> 00:34:54.367
If you want to try to play
with this type of stuff,

00:34:54.367 --> 00:34:56.534
what I've seen amazon.com,

00:34:56.534 --> 00:34:59.100
by far,
is what is paying the best

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:00.701
for affiliate marketing,

00:35:00.701 --> 00:35:03.367
just because, you know,
most people will buy something

00:35:03.367 --> 00:35:05.200
from Amazon, so...

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:08.267
If you send them
to other smaller Website

00:35:08.267 --> 00:35:12.067
like buy.com, newegg.com,
TigerDirect,

00:35:12.067 --> 00:35:15.067
and a few of the bunch,
the conversions aren't as good.

00:35:15.067 --> 00:35:17.033
And so by the way,

00:35:17.033 --> 00:35:19.100
Amazon, they have
their own affiliate program.

00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:22.868
If you want to go
and affiliate with the others,

00:35:22.868 --> 00:35:25.734
you have to use brokers
like Commission Junction,

00:35:25.734 --> 00:35:27.234
CJ,

00:35:27.234 --> 00:35:29.801
linkshare.com as well
is on the brokers.

00:35:29.801 --> 00:35:33.534
And I'm talking here
about technology products.

00:35:33.534 --> 00:35:35.501
But if your site
is about babies

00:35:35.501 --> 00:35:36.734
or about, you know, fashion,

00:35:36.734 --> 00:35:39.434
you know,
they have affiliate programs

00:35:39.434 --> 00:35:41.734
with almost any type
of retailers.

00:35:41.734 --> 00:35:44.133
I was planning to have time
to experiment

00:35:44.133 --> 00:35:47.234
before I/O something new,
but I did not.

00:35:47.234 --> 00:35:48.667
Something
I would like to play with,

00:35:48.667 --> 00:35:52.267
Zanox, is another one of these
brokers for affiliate.

00:35:52.267 --> 00:35:54.100
They just released
a few weeks ago

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:56.100
what they call
the Zanox Web Services.

00:35:56.100 --> 00:36:00.033
It's a nice API that seems
to allow you to get products

00:36:00.033 --> 00:36:02.601
based on some searches
you're doing.

00:36:02.601 --> 00:36:03.901
Meaning you can rotate products

00:36:03.901 --> 00:36:06.634
automatically
through their system.

00:36:06.634 --> 00:36:08.667
Just right now
what I'm doing is,

00:36:08.667 --> 00:36:11.634
I'm pooling
all the best sellers

00:36:11.634 --> 00:36:13.067
from a bunch of retailers,

00:36:13.067 --> 00:36:15.601
and then
I'm picking random products

00:36:15.601 --> 00:36:17.901
to make them rotate
every 12 minutes

00:36:17.901 --> 00:36:22.567
to make sure, you know--
I try to get people interest.

00:36:22.567 --> 00:36:25.167
Okay?

00:36:25.167 --> 00:36:27.534
So we talked
about iGoogle so far.

00:36:27.534 --> 00:36:29.667
Everything we discussed about

00:36:29.667 --> 00:36:32.667
applies as well
to OpenSocial applications.

00:36:32.667 --> 00:36:35.234
OpenSocial
is pretty much gadgets

00:36:35.234 --> 00:36:36.834
running on social Website,

00:36:36.834 --> 00:36:38.434
like, you know, MySpace,

00:36:38.434 --> 00:36:40.334
the orkut, the hi5,

00:36:40.334 --> 00:36:43.567
and you name it.

00:36:43.567 --> 00:36:45.300
The only difference,

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:47.367
I think, that you will face

00:36:47.367 --> 00:36:49.167
is each social container

00:36:49.167 --> 00:36:51.734
has its own policies
and type of services,

00:36:51.734 --> 00:36:53.701
'cause they
will tell you exactly,

00:36:53.701 --> 00:36:55.968
you know, what you cannot do
or what you can do,

00:36:55.968 --> 00:36:57.567
and you have to spend
quite some time

00:36:57.567 --> 00:36:58.767
with this document,

00:36:58.767 --> 00:37:00.601
because, you know,
they are pretty extensive.

00:37:00.601 --> 00:37:05.300
The common ground is
you will not be able to put ads

00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:07.400
on what they call
the profile view.

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:10.200
The profile view,
they say it's a user property.

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:11.868
You cannot put anything there.

00:37:11.868 --> 00:37:13.434
You can only monetize

00:37:13.434 --> 00:37:15.701
in what they call
the canvas view,

00:37:15.701 --> 00:37:17.567
when it's in full screen.

00:37:17.567 --> 00:37:20.467
But here, again,
you can use AdSense

00:37:20.467 --> 00:37:23.934
or affiliate marketing
or anything you would like.

00:37:23.934 --> 00:37:29.100
Okay.
Let me see where we are.

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:31.100
Yeah, I wanted
to show you something

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:33.234
that I think it's interesting.

00:37:33.234 --> 00:37:35.167
First,
it's pretty nice-looking.

00:37:35.167 --> 00:37:37.133
So it's, over a year,

00:37:37.133 --> 00:37:39.033
the evolution of AdSense,

00:37:39.033 --> 00:37:41.133
you know, for some gadget.

00:37:41.133 --> 00:37:43.000
The blue color show you

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.701
the daily page views.

00:37:44.701 --> 00:37:48.133
So you see it's a pretty nice
gross in average.

00:37:48.133 --> 00:37:51.701
In red,
I'm showing the evolution

00:37:51.701 --> 00:37:53.834
of the click-through rate.

00:37:53.834 --> 00:37:56.467
So as you can see,

00:37:56.467 --> 00:38:00.167
it's not moving exactly the same
as the number of views per day.

00:38:00.167 --> 00:38:01.901
And in green at the bottom,

00:38:01.901 --> 00:38:05.100
I'm showing the evolution
of the daily earnings.

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:07.234
I think it's interesting,

00:38:07.234 --> 00:38:10.467
because you would expect that
to correlate pretty well,

00:38:10.467 --> 00:38:12.000
and it's not the case at all.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.901
You know, this curve
move in all direction

00:38:13.901 --> 00:38:15.133
kind of by themself.

00:38:15.133 --> 00:38:17.868
So what I want
to point out here

00:38:17.868 --> 00:38:20.501
is don't have too much
expectation, you know.

00:38:20.501 --> 00:38:22.701
You will get, you know,
what they give you,

00:38:22.701 --> 00:38:24.701
but you will be
facing situation

00:38:24.701 --> 00:38:27.968
where there will be
maybe no ad available

00:38:27.968 --> 00:38:30.868
for the keywords
of your content at some point,

00:38:30.868 --> 00:38:33.067
which mean that
you will see a drop in revenue,

00:38:33.067 --> 00:38:37.033
or there will be
no high-paying ads

00:38:37.033 --> 00:38:38.234
available to you,

00:38:38.234 --> 00:38:40.067
but you will get,
you know, low-paying one.

00:38:40.067 --> 00:38:42.300
Maybe it would appeal more
to your user,

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:44.234
meaning more clicks
and less money.

00:38:44.234 --> 00:38:45.901
Something else
we've seen as well,

00:38:45.901 --> 00:38:47.934
and it was pretty unfortunate,

00:38:47.934 --> 00:38:49.133
at some point for--

00:38:49.133 --> 00:38:50.267
It lasted a few weeks.

00:38:50.267 --> 00:38:52.701
There was a pretty
bad bug in AdSense,

00:38:52.701 --> 00:38:55.067
and for my U.S. customers,

00:38:55.067 --> 00:38:56.968
they were seeing ads
in Chinese,

00:38:56.968 --> 00:38:59.834
German, you know,
and other foreign languages.

00:38:59.834 --> 00:39:01.734
So as you can bet, you know,

00:39:01.734 --> 00:39:04.067
you don't get
nice conversion with that.

00:39:04.067 --> 00:39:06.634
If they cannot read
what you are showing to them,

00:39:06.634 --> 00:39:08.100
they won't click on it.

00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:10.501
So, you know,
just keep it in mind.

00:39:10.501 --> 00:39:11.968
It's--yeah.

00:39:11.968 --> 00:39:15.701
It won't be a steady growth
when you go through more users.

00:39:15.701 --> 00:39:18.167
Let's talk a little bit
about maps,

00:39:18.167 --> 00:39:20.300
because that's an API

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:22.868
where Google is, you know,
number one for mapping.

00:39:22.868 --> 00:39:25.200
Also if you do any mashups,

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:27.200
or any Website
where you want to show

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:29.234
location-based information,

00:39:29.234 --> 00:39:31.234
you will be most likely
using Google Maps.

00:39:31.234 --> 00:39:33.601
They just released something,

00:39:33.601 --> 00:39:35.434
and I believe it's still
in beta right now,

00:39:35.434 --> 00:39:37.300
but it seems to be
very interesting.

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:39.100
As of today,

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:42.000
if you want to monetize
on a site with maps,

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.434
you have to put banners
outside the map.

00:39:46.434 --> 00:39:47.968
You're losing some real estate,

00:39:47.968 --> 00:39:49.667
because you could have
made the map bigger,

00:39:49.667 --> 00:39:51.467
and also
it's pretty difficult

00:39:51.467 --> 00:39:53.000
for AdSense to pick up

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.167
what the content
is talking about, you know.

00:39:55.167 --> 00:39:57.567
A map is just, you know,
graphic information.

00:39:57.567 --> 00:40:00.200
There is no real keyword
to latch on.

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:03.734
What they are releasing,
it's map ad units,

00:40:03.734 --> 00:40:05.067
so this time,

00:40:05.067 --> 00:40:08.334
the ad are showing up
inside the map area.

00:40:08.334 --> 00:40:12.701
You can see that on the corner,
right corner here.

00:40:12.701 --> 00:40:16.400
I will stop touching.
Okay.

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:18.767
Not only, you know,
you don't lose real estate,

00:40:18.767 --> 00:40:20.434
but better than that,

00:40:20.434 --> 00:40:24.033
the ad content
is using the geolocation,

00:40:24.033 --> 00:40:25.767
so as you pan through the map,

00:40:25.767 --> 00:40:27.400
they will get new content

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:29.267
which is relevant
to where you are,

00:40:29.267 --> 00:40:31.434
what is the location
you are looking at.

00:40:31.434 --> 00:40:33.734
So what we heard is

00:40:33.734 --> 00:40:36.167
they've seen people
in the better program

00:40:36.167 --> 00:40:39.434
seeing the ad revenues
going up ten times

00:40:39.434 --> 00:40:40.567
by just moving the ad

00:40:40.567 --> 00:40:43.067
from outside
to inside the map.

00:40:43.067 --> 00:40:44.901
That's pretty promising,

00:40:44.901 --> 00:40:47.601
so I'm looking forward
to trying that very soon.

00:40:47.601 --> 00:40:49.934
Another thing
they just released,

00:40:49.934 --> 00:40:51.434
and I don't have a slide yet,

00:40:51.434 --> 00:40:53.934
is they offer,
or they will offer,

00:40:53.934 --> 00:40:57.234
a new overlay,
which they call the Google bar.

00:40:57.234 --> 00:40:58.667
And it's a new overlay

00:40:58.667 --> 00:41:00.968
that you will put
on the lower left corner,

00:41:00.968 --> 00:41:03.868
and which give you the ability

00:41:03.868 --> 00:41:06.167
to add a search box
in the map.

00:41:06.167 --> 00:41:08.400
And if someone search
in this search box,

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:10.367
land to a page of results,

00:41:10.367 --> 00:41:14.067
and then if they click on
the affiliate link from Google,

00:41:14.067 --> 00:41:15.634
you will get a commission.

00:41:15.634 --> 00:41:17.300
That's many "if," right?

00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:19.501
But, yeah,
it's something small

00:41:19.501 --> 00:41:21.400
that won't take much space
on your map,

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:24.634
and which may lead
to some additional revenue.

00:41:24.634 --> 00:41:26.434
All right.

00:41:26.434 --> 00:41:28.801
We talked
about quite a few stuff--

00:41:28.801 --> 00:41:31.467
gadget, applications,
and monetization.

00:41:31.467 --> 00:41:33.801
All these stuff
are still pretty small project

00:41:33.801 --> 00:41:35.767
that you can put together
in a few days.

00:41:35.767 --> 00:41:37.667
If you have a bigger idea,

00:41:37.667 --> 00:41:40.100
you know, you have a pretty nice
Web application

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:42.000
you think you would like
to develop,

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.634
and make it, like,
a new start-up

00:41:44.634 --> 00:41:46.234
to do a real product

00:41:46.234 --> 00:41:48.133
that maybe you will sell
or something,

00:41:48.133 --> 00:41:50.167
what was difficult
a few years ago,

00:41:50.167 --> 00:41:51.901
is you had to shell out
quite some money

00:41:51.901 --> 00:41:53.234
to get started.

00:41:53.234 --> 00:41:54.400
You had to rent, you know,

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:56.667
hardware
or rent virtual servers.

00:41:56.667 --> 00:42:00.234
You had to pay development--
environment and stuff.

00:42:00.234 --> 00:42:02.734
What is very good for us today

00:42:02.734 --> 00:42:05.334
is we have all these
great communities from Google

00:42:05.334 --> 00:42:08.100
available without paying
a penny, right?

00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:10.667
For hosting,
now we have App Engine

00:42:10.667 --> 00:42:12.734
with Java or Python.

00:42:12.734 --> 00:42:16.033
As long as you are
in the ramp up mode,

00:42:16.033 --> 00:42:17.434
you won't pay anything,

00:42:17.434 --> 00:42:19.000
because, you know,
you have free quota,

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.601
which let you
do pretty much,

00:42:20.601 --> 00:42:23.567
you know, let you
go a long way already.

00:42:23.567 --> 00:42:25.067
Hosting videos

00:42:25.067 --> 00:42:28.033
can be extremely difficult
and expensive,

00:42:28.033 --> 00:42:30.334
because it's large data,
a lot of bandwidth,

00:42:30.334 --> 00:42:32.868
and, you know, YouTube
help you a long way with that.

00:42:32.868 --> 00:42:33.901
And same for GWT.

00:42:33.901 --> 00:42:35.934
You know,
as was many station

00:42:35.934 --> 00:42:37.868
doing these
past two days about GWT,

00:42:37.868 --> 00:42:41.334
very great AJAX framework
that let you do cool stuff.

00:42:41.334 --> 00:42:43.701
We talk about Maps,
Auth, and many others.

00:42:43.701 --> 00:42:44.834
And I can't, you know--

00:42:44.834 --> 00:42:47.300
I can't really testify
about that.

00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:49.834
I'm just in the process
we started a few months ago

00:42:49.834 --> 00:42:51.367
to create a new start-up.

00:42:51.367 --> 00:42:53.400
Nice T-shirt here.
TeamZone.

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:57.267
It's a video discussion solution
for private discussion.

00:42:57.267 --> 00:43:00.667
We want to enable remote teams
to better collaborate

00:43:00.667 --> 00:43:02.300
with recorded conversations.

00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:05.167
So we went through that,
and it help us a long way

00:43:05.167 --> 00:43:08.367
to get something running
without, you know,

00:43:08.367 --> 00:43:12.767
kicking out any big bucks
to start with.

00:43:12.767 --> 00:43:16.567
So something I wanted to add

00:43:16.567 --> 00:43:21.734
before I hand back the mic
to Michael,

00:43:21.734 --> 00:43:24.133
what has been
very useful for us,

00:43:24.133 --> 00:43:26.701
to start with with Michael,
when we first did

00:43:26.701 --> 00:43:28.267
some Google Gadgets
and stuff like that before

00:43:28.267 --> 00:43:29.567
to give some clients,

00:43:29.567 --> 00:43:32.634
is participating
in the Google groups.

00:43:32.634 --> 00:43:37.167
So I'm sure you know that
every single Google technology,

00:43:37.167 --> 00:43:40.534
they have their own
Google group

00:43:40.534 --> 00:43:45.501
for people to ask question
and, you know, to get some help.

00:43:45.501 --> 00:43:47.100
I think it's very important

00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:49.567
that if you are serious
about that, spend some time.

00:43:49.567 --> 00:43:51.501
Learn from this group
to start with.

00:43:51.501 --> 00:43:52.901
Ask questions.

00:43:52.901 --> 00:43:55.334
And as you grow
and you learn some,

00:43:55.334 --> 00:43:56.667
you know,
you get some expertise,

00:43:56.667 --> 00:43:58.801
start giving back
to the community

00:43:58.801 --> 00:44:00.000
and helping them as well.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.701
You know,
start answering question

00:44:01.701 --> 00:44:04.300
and showing that you are
an active participant.

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:06.567
That's the best way,
you know,

00:44:06.567 --> 00:44:09.334
to show the world that you
are an expert in this area.

00:44:09.334 --> 00:44:10.734
They have a ranking system

00:44:10.734 --> 00:44:13.801
where, you know,
people can put you stars,

00:44:13.801 --> 00:44:17.801
and, you know, you'll get
more visible in the group.

00:44:17.801 --> 00:44:20.734
We had many clients contact us

00:44:20.734 --> 00:44:22.767
because they've seen us
in these groups

00:44:22.767 --> 00:44:24.467
as active participant,

00:44:24.467 --> 00:44:27.667
and also, Google,
sometimes, you know,

00:44:27.667 --> 00:44:30.234
they name the API gurus

00:44:30.234 --> 00:44:32.767
for these groups,
and it's very good.

00:44:32.767 --> 00:44:34.200
You'll see
some customers sometime

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:36.868
posting some request
for codes.

00:44:36.868 --> 00:44:38.434
They say, "Okay,
I would like to do this.

00:44:38.434 --> 00:44:41.734
Contact me and let me know
how much it will cost."

00:44:41.734 --> 00:44:44.834
So, yeah, I think
it's very important.

00:44:44.834 --> 00:44:47.033
It's something you want
to look at definitely

00:44:47.033 --> 00:44:48.567
if you are serious
about doing business

00:44:48.567 --> 00:44:50.334
around these technologies.

00:44:50.334 --> 00:44:52.801
And I think that's it for me.

00:44:52.801 --> 00:44:55.033
Michael, back to you.

00:44:55.033 --> 00:44:59.701
[applause]

00:44:59.701 --> 00:45:01.167
Thompson:
Well, it's almost over.

00:45:01.167 --> 00:45:03.400
Okay.

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:06.234
Again,
the idea of this talk

00:45:06.234 --> 00:45:09.400
was for people interested
in building a business.

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:12.100
And the whole question is,

00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:14.667
is the business you build
sustainable?

00:45:14.667 --> 00:45:16.434
You know,
not everybody's cut out

00:45:16.434 --> 00:45:17.868
to have their own business.

00:45:17.868 --> 00:45:19.334
I'm kind of stubborn,

00:45:19.334 --> 00:45:23.434
and I don't like people
telling me what to do,

00:45:23.434 --> 00:45:24.934
different things like that.

00:45:24.934 --> 00:45:26.634
I don't mind working by myself.

00:45:26.634 --> 00:45:29.501
So not everybody
has those characteristics.

00:45:29.501 --> 00:45:32.133
Where I live,

00:45:32.133 --> 00:45:33.801
the bank's
right across the street.

00:45:33.801 --> 00:45:35.100
They know me.

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:37.734
If I wanted to go borrow money
to start a business,

00:45:37.734 --> 00:45:38.901
they'd loan it to me,

00:45:38.901 --> 00:45:40.868
as long
as I'm willing to put up

00:45:40.868 --> 00:45:46.234
60% of my own personal assets
as collateral.

00:45:46.234 --> 00:45:48.567
But it's not for everybody.

00:45:48.567 --> 00:45:51.367
If I did go for a loan--

00:45:51.367 --> 00:45:52.968
I didn't have to for this,

00:45:52.968 --> 00:45:54.901
but if I did,

00:45:54.901 --> 00:45:58.000
there'd be forms and questions,

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.901
and let's see the business plan
and all those sorts of things.

00:46:00.901 --> 00:46:02.133
But it all boils down to,

00:46:02.133 --> 00:46:04.601
is this business
going to be sustainable?

00:46:04.601 --> 00:46:07.667
And, for me,
the definition of sustainable

00:46:07.667 --> 00:46:10.033
is it keeps meeting
the break-even point.

00:46:10.033 --> 00:46:11.501
I generate enough sales

00:46:11.501 --> 00:46:13.501
to cover the cost
of doing business,

00:46:13.501 --> 00:46:14.501
plus a living for you

00:46:14.501 --> 00:46:16.300
and any employees
you might have.

00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:18.100
So the real question, then,

00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:21.167
in any business venture
you're thinking about starting

00:46:21.167 --> 00:46:24.000
will be, "Will the business

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.400
"provide enough value

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:28.067
"to keep customers
paying as much or more

00:46:28.067 --> 00:46:30.300
as your break-even point
from now on?"

00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:32.200
That was the point of the talk,

00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:34.100
and thank you so much
for your patience.

00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:35.734
I wish I was a better speaker.

00:46:35.734 --> 00:46:38.601
But I appreciate
you hanging in there with us.

00:46:38.601 --> 00:46:41.100
And I guess if anybody
had a question,

00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:42.901
this would be the time.

00:46:42.901 --> 00:46:46.501
[applause]

00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:54.234
It's okay
if you don't have questions.

00:46:54.234 --> 00:46:57.501
Mouton: Yes.

00:46:57.501 --> 00:46:59.200
man: Could you
go back to the slide

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:02.667
that had the statistics
of the earnings?

00:47:04.234 --> 00:47:07.901
Thompson: Yeah.

00:47:07.901 --> 00:47:10.801
man: Where you have
your increase there--

00:47:10.801 --> 00:47:13.567
red goes up,
money goes down...

00:47:13.567 --> 00:47:14.601
Mouton: Yes?

00:47:14.601 --> 00:47:16.467
man: Do you think
that's a result

00:47:16.467 --> 00:47:19.868
of the people
who place the ads

00:47:19.868 --> 00:47:23.901
cut back on the amount
that they put in

00:47:23.901 --> 00:47:26.567
due to the fact that they're
getting excessive clicks,

00:47:26.567 --> 00:47:28.868
so they're spending
through their budgets

00:47:28.868 --> 00:47:32.267
before they get
any decent returns?

00:47:32.267 --> 00:47:33.868
Mouton:
That could be one explanation.

00:47:33.868 --> 00:47:35.901
The other thing is maybe,
you know,

00:47:35.901 --> 00:47:38.734
one advertiser
was paying a lot of money,

00:47:38.734 --> 00:47:40.601
just had no budget anymore,

00:47:40.601 --> 00:47:42.667
and we are getting
different ads now,

00:47:42.667 --> 00:47:44.467
which may be more appealing,
you know,

00:47:44.467 --> 00:47:46.601
stuff that people are more
likely to be interested in,

00:47:46.601 --> 00:47:47.901
but pay far less.

00:47:47.901 --> 00:47:51.334
In this case, it would probably
pay four times less,

00:47:51.334 --> 00:47:53.501
because we double the clicks,
and we get half the money.

00:47:53.501 --> 00:47:56.234
Again,
we can try to explain,

00:47:56.234 --> 00:47:57.601
but it won't help us out,

00:47:57.601 --> 00:48:00.000
because the thing is,
it's a black box, you know.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.167
So it's pragmatic
for you to get it,

00:48:04.167 --> 00:48:06.334
you know,
and run with it.

00:48:06.334 --> 00:48:08.467
Thompson:
Another way that can happen,

00:48:08.467 --> 00:48:10.734
That could be
if somebody has a new campaign.

00:48:10.734 --> 00:48:12.033
Like, I remember one time

00:48:12.033 --> 00:48:16.567
an automotive company
started showing costs per--

00:48:16.567 --> 00:48:19.167
paying for impressions
on one of my sites.

00:48:19.167 --> 00:48:20.834
And I saw something
similar to that.

00:48:20.834 --> 00:48:22.033
I kept checking into it.

00:48:22.033 --> 00:48:24.133
I was seeing an ad
I didn't see before,

00:48:24.133 --> 00:48:26.334
and I realized they were
paying not for clicks,

00:48:26.334 --> 00:48:27.567
but just for impressions.

00:48:27.567 --> 00:48:31.567
It could just be somebody
had a big campaign.

00:48:31.567 --> 00:48:33.701
man: Thank you.

00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:41.567
Mouton:
Any other question?

00:48:41.567 --> 00:48:43.167
Yes, please.

00:48:43.167 --> 00:48:47.167
man: Just curious
what your thoughts would be,

00:48:47.167 --> 00:48:48.801
you know, if, let's say,

00:48:48.801 --> 00:48:50.801
if, like, a two-developer team
is there,

00:48:50.801 --> 00:48:52.534
and they're creating gadgets

00:48:52.534 --> 00:48:56.200
for either iGoogle
versus a social network.

00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:59.367
You know,
so what'll be the ROI

00:48:59.367 --> 00:49:01.501
if you were to compare,
you know,

00:49:01.501 --> 00:49:03.701
"We have X number of hours
to put in."

00:49:03.701 --> 00:49:06.567
You know, "Which way
would we rather go--

00:49:06.567 --> 00:49:09.267
"create little gadgets
for social networks,

00:49:09.267 --> 00:49:11.267
versus, you know,
an iGoogle?"

00:49:11.267 --> 00:49:14.133
Mouton:
Okay, my take on that is

00:49:14.133 --> 00:49:16.634
if you're
starting something today,

00:49:16.634 --> 00:49:19.367
you'll have a bigger reach
on social networks.

00:49:19.367 --> 00:49:20.734
You know, iGoogle,

00:49:20.734 --> 00:49:22.634
we're talking about
tens of millions of people.

00:49:22.634 --> 00:49:24.133
With social network,

00:49:24.133 --> 00:49:26.434
we're talking about hundreds
of million of people, right?

00:49:26.434 --> 00:49:27.934
With little more work,

00:49:27.934 --> 00:49:30.934
you can move an application
you've done for MySpace,

00:49:30.934 --> 00:49:32.534
you can move it to hi5,

00:49:32.534 --> 00:49:34.667
to, you know,
to millions of places.

00:49:34.667 --> 00:49:37.100
So, yeah, if you are
starting something today,

00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:38.100
think social.

00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:39.167
That's where you should be.

00:49:39.167 --> 00:49:41.133
For us, when we started
four years ago,

00:49:41.133 --> 00:49:42.667
iGoogle was the place to be.

00:49:42.667 --> 00:49:45.400
man: So you are entering
in that space now?

00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:46.701
Mouton:
Yes. Yes, yes.

00:49:46.701 --> 00:49:47.767
man:
Okay. Thanks.

00:49:47.767 --> 00:49:49.300
Mouton:
But on the other hand,

00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:53.634
as I mentioned, OpenSocial is,
in my opinion,

00:49:53.634 --> 00:49:55.200
a superset of the iGoogle.

00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:58.601
So if you can do both,
you know, do it, right?

00:49:58.601 --> 00:50:02.033
You know, the more places
you're seeding your application,

00:50:02.033 --> 00:50:03.901
the better reach you will have.

00:50:03.901 --> 00:50:05.801
man: Thanks.

00:50:05.801 --> 00:50:09.868
Mouton:
You're welcome. Yeah.

00:50:09.868 --> 00:50:10.934
All right.

00:50:10.934 --> 00:50:12.200
If there's another question,
