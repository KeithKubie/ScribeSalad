00:00:01.656 --> 00:00:06.926
&gt;&gt;Daniel: For kids who really feel
like most of life happens to them,

00:00:07.056 --> 00:00:08.866
for them to have an
opportunity to feel

00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:10.906
that they have an impact
is very exciting.

00:00:10.986 --> 00:00:15.076
The D3 program is designed
specifically for teenagers.

00:00:15.806 --> 00:00:19.206
And they feel that it's really
relevant to their lives,

00:00:19.206 --> 00:00:20.946
and relevant to the community
here, People Serving People.

00:00:22.546 --> 00:00:24.976
&gt;&gt;Emily: One, two, three, jump!

00:00:28.106 --> 00:00:30.206
Jennifer's trying to explain
the game we're about to play.

00:00:30.206 --> 00:00:31.376
I think most of you played it.

00:00:31.376 --> 00:00:31.906
It was called signs.

00:00:33.056 --> 00:00:36.096
&gt;&gt;Daniel: People serving people is
the region's largest homeless shelter

00:00:36.096 --> 00:00:37.466
for children and families.

00:00:38.056 --> 00:00:40.226
But we're not a warehouse
for families.

00:00:40.706 --> 00:00:43.946
Our whole purpose in being is
moving the kid and their folks

00:00:43.946 --> 00:00:46.566
from a really desperate
situation towards self-sufficiency

00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:47.966
as quickly as we can do it.

00:00:54.736 --> 00:00:56.376
&gt;&gt;Kim: D3 in a nutshell is a process.

00:00:56.536 --> 00:00:58.146
It's broken up into three parts,

00:00:58.146 --> 00:01:00.706
which is Dream It,
Design It and Do It.

00:01:00.816 --> 00:01:03.066
And this is a process all
professional designers use,

00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:05.996
and it's really focusing on the how,

00:01:06.346 --> 00:01:07.976
not necessarily just the
what, or the end result.

00:01:09.526 --> 00:01:11.316
&gt;&gt;Emily: Should we walk
through it really quick?

00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:11.536
&gt;&gt;Boy: Yeah.

00:01:11.606 --> 00:01:12.626
&gt;&gt;Emily: We started
out in the beginning.

00:01:12.626 --> 00:01:16.156
We took pictures with that
good, bad and the ugly activity.

00:01:16.856 --> 00:01:18.276
We gave a thumbs up,
thumbs down, remember that?

00:01:18.276 --> 00:01:18.806
&gt;&gt;Boy: Thumbs in the middle.

00:01:18.916 --> 00:01:18.983
&gt;&gt;Emily: Yeah.

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:22.536
&gt;&gt;Kim: I think a lot of people
think the design process is very--

00:01:22.536 --> 00:01:27.036
a mysterious kind of hidden thing
that happens behind the scenes.

00:01:27.196 --> 00:01:30.526
And really what D3 does is
it demystifies that process.

00:01:30.826 --> 00:01:32.086
There's no magic involved.

00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:36.226
It's these very flexible,
but structured steps to walk

00:01:36.306 --> 00:01:37.306
through and approach a problem.

00:01:37.306 --> 00:01:38.966
&gt;&gt;Emily: There's six cards,
so they're going to go

00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:41.046
on these littler circles,
not on the light bulbs,

00:01:41.046 --> 00:01:43.156
but on these little
circles around, okay?

00:01:43.156 --> 00:01:46.646
&gt;&gt;So this project started as
a spatial redesign project.

00:01:46.836 --> 00:01:50.846
The teens wanted to redesign
or revamp a space at PSP

00:01:50.846 --> 00:01:52.896
that they felt was
being underutilized

00:01:53.406 --> 00:01:55.956
or that lacked a little pizzazz.

00:01:55.956 --> 00:01:57.676
They wanted to put their
stamp on space here.

00:01:58.026 --> 00:02:00.226
&gt;&gt;Boy: We had narrowed
down all the spaces.

00:02:00.876 --> 00:02:02.966
Chose the three things that we liked
best, and we wanted to improve on.

00:02:04.046 --> 00:02:04.506
&gt;&gt;Adam: Okay.

00:02:04.606 --> 00:02:07.076
&gt;&gt;Boy: We chose the lobby.

00:02:07.446 --> 00:02:07.706
&gt;&gt;Adam: Okay.

00:02:08.076 --> 00:02:10.516
&gt;&gt;Emily: They chose the lobby,
because it's chaotic, it's loud,

00:02:10.866 --> 00:02:12.706
it's a very transitional space.

00:02:12.706 --> 00:02:14.176
People are always coming and going.

00:02:14.556 --> 00:02:17.236
And knew that that was
a space that they wanted

00:02:17.236 --> 00:02:19.146
to add something to, add value to.

00:02:19.616 --> 00:02:21.866
&gt;&gt;So what did we finally,
finally decide on?

00:02:22.376 --> 00:02:23.546
Out of all of these ideas?

00:02:23.846 --> 00:02:28.756
&gt;&gt;Boy: We made a map about
how people will find their way

00:02:28.756 --> 00:02:31.446
around inside and outside PSP.

00:02:32.106 --> 00:02:35.456
&gt;&gt;Emily: After brainstorming,
they found this map idea.

00:02:36.206 --> 00:02:37.626
Creating a map of the neighborhood,

00:02:37.726 --> 00:02:39.506
which would not only
bring people together,

00:02:39.506 --> 00:02:42.526
because people travel quite a bit
together outside of the building,

00:02:42.526 --> 00:02:45.006
but also bringing people
together physically in the lobby

00:02:45.226 --> 00:02:47.026
over a new piece that
we'll be hanging.

00:02:47.446 --> 00:02:47.956
We actually

00:02:48.046 --> 00:02:48.946
canvassed the building.

00:02:48.946 --> 00:02:51.746
We surveyed as many people
as we could, over 90 people.

00:02:52.136 --> 00:02:54.746
And allowed them to sort
of give their feedback.

00:02:55.216 --> 00:02:55.926
"Where do you go?

00:02:55.926 --> 00:02:58.796
What kind of places do
you visit most often?

00:02:58.796 --> 00:03:00.136
What places do you not visit?

00:03:00.136 --> 00:03:03.156
What places could you go if you
had an afternoon to yourselves?"

00:03:03.246 --> 00:03:04.446
&gt;&gt;Adam: We have a starter map.

00:03:04.446 --> 00:03:06.186
So we haven't really done
much with this map yet,

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:08.456
but it's got the basic foundation.

00:03:08.516 --> 00:03:10.366
So we have all the
streets in Minneapolis.

00:03:11.026 --> 00:03:12.286
We got the Light Rail in here.

00:03:12.466 --> 00:03:17.416
&gt;&gt;Joyce is a creative branding and
digital workshop, so we create logos

00:03:17.696 --> 00:03:20.586
and brand identities for businesses,
as well as websites, and apps,

00:03:20.586 --> 00:03:22.986
and that kind of a thing.

00:03:23.436 --> 00:03:25.116
&gt;&gt;We have some of the
street names labeled,

00:03:25.116 --> 00:03:27.846
but then we have all
these symbols and numbers.

00:03:27.846 --> 00:03:29.506
You guys are going to
help us place those,

00:03:29.966 --> 00:03:31.676
tell us where they are on this map.

00:03:31.676 --> 00:03:32.096
And also...

00:03:32.096 --> 00:03:35.126
&gt;&gt;Emily brought this project to
Joyce, knowing that they're looking

00:03:35.126 --> 00:03:38.836
for kind of a local business, a local
creative shop partner that could sort

00:03:38.836 --> 00:03:42.326
of showcase what it's like to be a
creative professional as a career.

00:03:42.806 --> 00:03:44.746
&gt;&gt;We found where PSP
is headquartered.

00:03:44.746 --> 00:03:45.706
It's Portland and Third.

00:03:45.706 --> 00:03:49.156
And we started to find Gold
Medal Park, so that's up here.

00:03:49.506 --> 00:03:51.116
We put a background in behind it.

00:03:51.966 --> 00:03:53.916
Where else is something that's kind
of new there, we have the Guthrie.

00:03:55.306 --> 00:03:55.776
&gt;&gt;Subway.

00:03:55.846 --> 00:03:56.156
&gt;&gt;Adam: Subway.

00:03:56.156 --> 00:03:57.826
Should we find where the subway is.

00:03:58.046 --> 00:03:58.836
&gt;&gt;It's right there.

00:03:58.966 --> 00:03:59.976
&gt;&gt;Adam: Right, Washington and Fifth.

00:04:03.056 --> 00:04:05.336
&gt;&gt;Emily: We partnered with
Joyce to get this done.

00:04:05.336 --> 00:04:06.406
They were a huge help.

00:04:06.406 --> 00:04:10.186
They did all the backend design for
the map, and the kids went to Joyce

00:04:10.186 --> 00:04:13.706
to help lay it out, and
pick colors, typefaces,

00:04:13.706 --> 00:04:16.136
and really understand
how that came together.

00:04:16.136 --> 00:04:18.506
&gt;&gt;Adam: You know what's
a nice on a map, Q2?

00:04:18.656 --> 00:04:21.896
It lets us see that we have
a really consistent system

00:04:21.896 --> 00:04:23.826
and that we're not-- nothing
looks too similar, right?

00:04:24.256 --> 00:04:26.276
&gt;&gt;It's actually been
kind of fascinating,

00:04:26.276 --> 00:04:27.576
because I think most kids,

00:04:27.576 --> 00:04:30.336
and especially these kids
are curious by nature.

00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:32.166
And when they come into kind
of a creative environment,

00:04:32.166 --> 00:04:34.636
something they haven't seen
before, a lot of them kind of

00:04:34.636 --> 00:04:36.136
come out of their shell a little bit.

00:04:36.136 --> 00:04:40.826
And really want to engage and
understand how things translate

00:04:40.876 --> 00:04:42.976
from just an idea to the end product.

00:04:44.046 --> 00:04:45.936
&gt;&gt;So what color should we
use to indicate the park?

00:04:46.686 --> 00:04:47.596
&gt;&gt;Green.

00:04:47.596 --> 00:04:49.536
Like 'cause it says a peaceful place.

00:04:49.696 --> 00:04:49.896
&gt;&gt;Adam: Yeah.

00:04:50.096 --> 00:04:52.000
&gt;&gt;So just put it like
a whole bunch of grass right there.

00:04:53.066 --> 00:04:55.626
&gt;&gt;Emily: We know that our
teens are extremely interested

00:04:55.626 --> 00:04:57.646
in art and music and culture.

00:04:57.646 --> 00:05:02.286
And Joyce is a place that blends all
of those with their work constantly.

00:05:02.686 --> 00:05:06.266
So for the teens to learn from
young professionals that they see

00:05:06.266 --> 00:05:10.446
as relevant people, that they see
as cool people, and to sort of learn

00:05:10.446 --> 00:05:12.036
from them, to be under their wing,

00:05:12.036 --> 00:05:14.086
I think is really transformative
for them.

00:05:14.086 --> 00:05:17.000
They see something that they
otherwise wouldn't see anywhere else.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.700
&gt;&gt;So where were we?

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.500
Right here?

00:05:19.106 --> 00:05:19.516
&gt;&gt;Adam: Yep.

00:05:19.976 --> 00:05:20.236
&gt;&gt;As well as right there.

00:05:20.486 --> 00:05:21.796
&gt;&gt;Adam: Yep.

00:05:22.326 --> 00:05:27.306
&gt;&gt;Emily: It creates that pathway
in their brain from, "I like art,

00:05:27.306 --> 00:05:30.976
and I'm good at art, or design, but
I don't know what I can do with it."

00:05:32.126 --> 00:05:32.976
&gt;&gt;This is artwork.

00:05:33.246 --> 00:05:33.816
This is me.

00:05:33.926 --> 00:05:35.156
&gt;&gt;Woman: Wow, you did
a lot of work today!

00:05:35.575 --> 00:05:36.186
&gt;&gt;Adam: Excellent,
yeah, this was a lot--

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.776
&gt;&gt;Emily: Guys, this
was four weeks of work!

00:05:37.816 --> 00:05:38.826
&gt;&gt;Adam: This is a big project.

00:05:39.076 --> 00:05:39.396
&gt;&gt;Boy: Yeah.

00:05:39.396 --> 00:05:40.016
&gt;&gt;Emily: Four whole weeks.

00:05:40.016 --> 00:05:41.826
Let's give ourselves
a round of applause.

00:05:41.976 --> 00:05:42.250
[ applause ]

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.976
Whoo-hoo!

00:05:43.076 --> 00:05:46.616
&gt;&gt;Adam: When you think about
applying and teaching design thinking

00:05:46.616 --> 00:05:50.606
to really anyone, and especially
kids, it's again kind of getting

00:05:50.606 --> 00:05:53.486
to the heart of empowerment
in my mind.

00:05:53.486 --> 00:05:57.776
And giving them tools and processes
internally that they can use

00:05:57.826 --> 00:05:59.826
to impact the world around them.

00:05:59.826 --> 00:06:02.816
And instead of running
into a wall and deciding

00:06:02.816 --> 00:06:04.916
that they can't go any
further, because they don't have

00:06:04.916 --> 00:06:08.496
that brainstorming tool, or that
problem solving tool, they can think

00:06:08.496 --> 00:06:10.846
of different ways that they
can move past that hurdle,

00:06:10.846 --> 00:06:12.696
move past that obstacle,
and kind of get

00:06:12.696 --> 00:06:13.976
on to the next thing in their life.

00:06:15.106 --> 00:06:18.036
&gt;&gt;Boy: We had created a map
for people outside the state

00:06:18.036 --> 00:06:19.906
that don't their way around.

00:06:20.256 --> 00:06:26.966
And the map showed places where they
need to go, and how they get there.

00:06:28.166 --> 00:06:29.656
&gt;&gt;Emily: The map now will
be hung in the lobby.

00:06:29.656 --> 00:06:33.666
It will be hung right in front of the
front desk, so people who are waiting

00:06:33.666 --> 00:06:37.866
for supplies, people who are
waiting to use the phone or laundry,

00:06:38.096 --> 00:06:39.976
are able to look at this awesome
map that these teens created.

00:06:41.096 --> 00:06:44.466
&gt;&gt;Let's give everyone
a round of applause.

00:06:44.466 --> 00:06:46.046
[ applause, cheers ]

00:06:46.046 --> 00:06:46.896
&gt;&gt;Ange: You need to
challenge students

00:06:46.896 --> 00:06:48.316
because they'll rise to the occasion.

00:06:48.456 --> 00:06:49.866
They'll rise to the
challenge you set forth.

00:06:50.736 --> 00:06:56.206
And by putting students in the
context of a business environment,

00:06:56.206 --> 00:07:00.106
or real world, you are requiring
them to rise to the challenge

00:07:00.146 --> 00:07:03.466
and you're setting a high
expectation of how they're going to

00:07:04.066 --> 00:07:05.396
perform, how they're going to behave.

00:07:05.476 --> 00:07:06.826
The output that they're
going to produce.

00:07:06.916 --> 00:07:10.506
And I can recreate that as much as
possible in a classroom setting,

00:07:10.976 --> 00:07:16.366
but when you shift into a different
environment, the culture changes.

00:07:16.366 --> 00:07:17.306
Your feelings change.

00:07:17.306 --> 00:07:18.576
Everything about that changes.

00:07:18.666 --> 00:07:21.786
You have authentic problems
and an authentic environment

00:07:21.786 --> 00:07:25.676
in which you're solving them.

00:07:25.756 --> 00:07:27.856
&gt;&gt;Daniel: I've heard from some of
the kids that they've been able

00:07:27.856 --> 00:07:31.666
to apply what they're learning
in D3 into solving problems

00:07:31.666 --> 00:07:35.276
that their families are facing,
in terms of selecting apartments,

00:07:35.276 --> 00:07:36.496
and improving their housing.

00:07:36.606 --> 00:07:41.266
This is a real opportunity for
them to feel genuinely engaged

00:07:41.726 --> 00:07:45.676
and generally reinforce, and
that their ideas do have value,

00:07:45.966 --> 00:07:47.586
and what they're doing does matter.

00:07:47.856 --> 00:07:50.826
And in their lives
that's really quite rare.
