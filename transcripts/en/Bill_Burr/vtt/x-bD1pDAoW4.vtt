1
00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.610
I'm sitting at the airport and they have all this NFL pregame going on and I'm

2
00:00:03.611 --> 00:00:04.301
thinking of, fuck,

3
00:00:04.301 --> 00:00:09.301
I'm gonna Miss Everything and I'm watching the pregame and which I never watch

4
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.390
and I haven't really watched it in years.

5
00:00:13.391 --> 00:00:17.310
It's why I don't know anybody's names anymore. And I'm really bad at that.

6
00:00:17.311 --> 00:00:20.860
I mean part of it's cause I'm on the road all the fucking time. But uh,

7
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.710
I think, um, I dunno. Sorry guys.

8
00:00:26.711 --> 00:00:29.360
Can you tell him looking at something else here on the computer? I,

9
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.480
so I'm sitting there watching it and uh,

10
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.050
the first thing I see and I started tweeting this shit and it kind of started,

11
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:35.330
uh,

12
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.330
I got a little thing going on Twitter of just the dumb shit that they say in the

13
00:00:40.421 --> 00:00:44.500
whole fucking um, the NFL pregame. Okay.

14
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.500
<v 1>You'll like freeze tape right there. Okay. Will you she right there.</v>

15
00:00:47.501 --> 00:00:49.120
What are you each making decision?

16
00:00:49.121 --> 00:00:53.110
He is making decisions and that is a good thing. He's looking good.

17
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.410
He's not all you. Last year he was just looking, it was just first rate.

18
00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.530
He was telegraphing where he was going to throw the ball. And if you,

19
00:00:59.531 --> 00:01:03.310
she right here, what he's doing, he is now checking down the field.

20
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.530
It's chicken in third read.

21
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.740
Now I can tell you when a quarterback judge that there is,

22
00:01:08.741 --> 00:01:12.070
when he's doing to play the quarterback position and [inaudible]

23
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.520
<v 0>film level, right? Fucking all of that shit.</v>

24
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.690
Just a bunch of fucking people in suits breaking down the game the way it never

25
00:01:23.501 --> 00:01:25.000
needed to be broken down.

26
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.450
It is completely a product of fucking 9,024 hour sports channels.

27
00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:32.200
I mean, dude, I'm sitting there,

28
00:01:32.201 --> 00:01:37.201
it's like two and a half hours before kickoff and they're already doing pregame.

29
00:01:38.291 --> 00:01:38.950
It's like, dude,

30
00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.750
pregame used to be a half hour before Brent Musburger,

31
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.720
Irv Cross, that Kennedy woman, whatever the hell.

32
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.040
Jackie can't not Jackie Kennedy. What the hell was the name? Um,

33
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.900
and then Jimmy, the Greek, that was CBS and NBC.

34
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.530
You had fucking Brian Gumbel and Mike,

35
00:02:01.531 --> 00:02:06.330
Adam Lee NFL 81 right? That's what the fuck do you do?

36
00:02:06.331 --> 00:02:06.631
That's all.

37
00:02:06.631 --> 00:02:10.020
You just watched that and they went around the league and it was cool. Bang,

38
00:02:10.021 --> 00:02:13.230
Bang, boom. And you were done and then you went to your local feed.

39
00:02:13.231 --> 00:02:14.700
Now you just got these guys who are out there,

40
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.360
they're are acting it out on that half a football field

41
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.870
<v 1>over and far.</v>

42
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.900
Tell you right now what they're trying to do is you're trying to turn around the

43
00:02:24.901 --> 00:02:28.560
culture in the locker, your own the locker room for years. It is,

44
00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.250
it has been a mentality that we are not gonna win the big one.

45
00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:35.580
And that's why they brought in Joe fucking bag of donuts to come in and cray

46
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.680
playground. But it's stupid shit ever

47
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.410
<v 0>over and fucking over and over. So anyway, so I go, I get on the,</v>

48
00:02:43.411 --> 00:02:46.740
I started tweeting all of that shit and uh, you know,

49
00:02:46.741 --> 00:02:50.390
just making up player names and all that dumb shit that they said, right?

50
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.830
<v 1>He's a changed man. He came in niche,</v>

51
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.750
he came into camp in the best shape of his football life.

52
00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.250
<v 2>He's the two, his coaches,</v>

53
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.150
<v 0>he is it his wife and he only tested positive to weed. And I'll tell you that</v>

54
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.160
<v 1>type attitude,</v>

55
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.640
that type attitude is you could change your shit in the locker room.

56
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.270
<v 0>How many fucking times do they even sit there rolling their eyes with if their</v>

57
00:03:15.271 --> 00:03:19.110
football speak drives me up the fucking wall.

58
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.570
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

59
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.960
<v 0>Oh. Anyway.</v>

60
00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.960
She [inaudible] he needs to do is he needs to feel the pass rush you have to in

61
00:03:27.181 --> 00:03:28.640
the national football league,

62
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.960
which you have to be able to do is feel when that pocket is collapsing around

63
00:03:33.981 --> 00:03:35.390
you. You've gotta have a clock in your head.

64
00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.840
You gotta have a clock in your head and you don't want what it's clicking down.

65
00:03:38.841 --> 00:03:42.050
You have to know, you must get rid of the football. Cause I tell you right now,

66
00:03:42.051 --> 00:03:44.090
if you don't do that and you take a sack right there,

67
00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.760
that that is a drive killer, Mike.

68
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.130
<v 1>Oh absolutely. Absolutely. I absolutely agree. What he's doing here is you go,</v>

69
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.090
he's parenting a ball. He's telegraphing his parishes.

70
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.090
This is the type of stuff that they worked on in the off season.

71
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.900
He showed some promising moments in the preseason, but I go tell you today,

72
00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.690
I don't know where that was in an I got to you. I've got to wonder, is it

73
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.340
<v 0>you hit the panic button down chaplain,</v>

74
00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.950
who the fuck can sit there and watch that horse?

75
00:04:10.951 --> 00:04:15.951
And then what I love is sports fans watch that shit and then it gets,

76
00:04:17.861 --> 00:04:22.861
it's like a virus and then it gets in their fucking heads and then they go out

77
00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:26.920
to sports bars and you talk about football and then they start sounding like

78
00:04:26.921 --> 00:04:27.754
those people.

79
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.230
<v 3>Okay,</v>

80
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.740
<v 0>Yo try. You know Joe, you gotta have a fucking clock in your head, kid.</v>

81
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.910
One, 1002,

82
00:04:38.911 --> 00:04:43.460
1000 fucking get rid of it. Throw it out of botch.

83
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:46.960
Joe, you're allowed to do that.

84
00:04:46.961 --> 00:04:50.190
As long as you're within the confines you the fucking pocket.

85
00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.510
I can't, I can't fucking, I can't go to sports bars.

86
00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.350
Why would you? I don't give a fuck how fucking broke you are.

87
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.610
There was no reason to not have the NFL package. There isn't. Alright,

88
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.860
you can go 40 fucking days without food. As long as you got water, you're fine.

89
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.000
Do yourself a fucking favor. Starve yourself and yes.

90
00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:15.291
Okay.

91
00:05:15.291 --> 00:05:20.291
I'm advocating Anorexia to get the NFL package to not go down

92
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.430
to the fucking sports bar eating that heart attack food.

93
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:27.270
<v 3>Okay,</v>

94
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.400
<v 0>watch it. A bunch of grown men walking around in jerseys like they're dated,</v>

95
00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.640
dating the fucking player doing it all day,

96
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.790
Dan. Horse Shit.

97
00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.760
You gotta go down there looking at those tired waitresses join a whore it up and

98
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.800
they're fucking cutoff ref shirt

99
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.930
listening to that bullshit. Unbelievable.

100
00:05:49.931 --> 00:05:53.110
At time to make a change. I'll tell you, I ain't,

101
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.470
have I been up the I am if I am the [inaudible] of court now, who's had,

102
00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:58.030
you've got to

103
00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.863
<v 1>understand with this kid,</v>

104
00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:03.770
this kid is 19 offensive coordinators and the last seven seasons.

105
00:06:03.771 --> 00:06:05.870
Okay, I still don't take that. We have,

106
00:06:05.871 --> 00:06:10.740
see what this kid is able to do up there. I'm still holding on. Yeah,

107
00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.660
but you have to on your skin. Did he hear head Achy, hinge?

108
00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.720
<v 0>I don't know. I can't. I can't fuck. Right, right, right.</v>

109
00:06:18.721 --> 00:06:21.450
I'm annoying myself just, just even listening to this shit.

110
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.210
<v 1>Well Joey, you get all these teams, they know each other.</v>

111
00:06:24.211 --> 00:06:28.570
They meet twice a year. Each team. They know what they do.

112
00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.040
When a Toyo tell you, I know it's hard to be team two times one season out day,

113
00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:36.350
right? Your Baba football fan. I gotta be looking to that first matchup. Oh,

114
00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.650
these Seattle Seahawks against those share Francesco 49ers.

115
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:45.330
Can you 40 niners get over the hump? I mean, this is the question.

116
00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.040
I mean there's rumors that Jim Harbaugh is losing the locker room.

117
00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:54.440
<v 0>Okay. How can you sit and watch that? Because anyways, I'll tell you new way.</v>

118
00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.410
I can tell you I love it. You know what?

119
00:06:55.411 --> 00:06:58.510
I'll give you my predictions for week two. Okay.

120
00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.200
Week two pregame football analysis.

121
00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:07.040
And now off to New England where a shock legally last week they lost the size of

122
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.700
Lee. So these Miami Dolphins of the dolphin,

123
00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:17.430
Miami County de Wade fucking area code, I'll tell you right now, I mean,

124
00:07:17.431 --> 00:07:20.580
what do you think's going to happen when they come in and they play the a the

125
00:07:20.581 --> 00:07:23.790
fucking the fucking Austin city.

126
00:07:23.791 --> 00:07:25.320
I should topes what do you think's going to happen?

127
00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.570
<v 1>Well, I'll tell you right now. Oh, you know what I mean? You'll be, look,</v>

128
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.500
we all know what Tom Brady could do. We all know bill bell. A check is a genius,

129
00:07:32.501 --> 00:07:33.850
but I'll tell you right now, I mean,

130
00:07:33.851 --> 00:07:36.880
I mean you get the talent or no channel and I mean you gotta be,

131
00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.830
you gotta be concerned about that second half. I mean, hey,

132
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.820
I want a life less out there. It's going to be a lot of that shit.

133
00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:44.110
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

134
00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:48.550
<v 1>I mean, if they lose today, they're all in to [inaudible] road sugar.</v>

135
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:49.930
<v 0>Like,</v>

136
00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:54.820
like I couldn't be doing that for a fucking hour,

137
00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:57.560
not for an hour. They'll do it for a little bit and then they're gonna.

138
00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.030
I don't know what the fuck else they're going to talk about.

139
00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:03.910
I see the world through my team and I know that they're going to be doing that

140
00:08:03.911 --> 00:08:04.240
shit.

141
00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.510
Or you can just skip all of that and you can go fucking workout at the gym,

142
00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:09.843
right?

143
00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:14.990
Go for a hike with your fucking dog or something and you can come back.

144
00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:19.990
The wonderful world of fucking DVR, you can come back an hour before the game,

145
00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:24.160
after the game started. You can just plow through all the fucking halftime,

146
00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:28.660
everything and just get right to the third quarter, right?

147
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:32.550
Let your wife watch the real housewives during the first half,
