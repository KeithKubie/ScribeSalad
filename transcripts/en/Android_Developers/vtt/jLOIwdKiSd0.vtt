00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.050
SHAUN RUTLAND: We saw
an opportunity in 2011

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.150
when mobile was getting
very, very exciting.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.170
And that really gave us
the energy to start Hutch.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.041
We are a mobile studio
based in London,

00:00:15.041 --> 00:00:17.290
and a lot of the people in
the studio are petrolheads.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.740
All they do is talk about
cars, so we're wholly

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.010
focused on racing games.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.426
In the past, racing games
were typically very skilled.

00:00:24.426 --> 00:00:25.800
And we're trying
to find new ways

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.860
to engage players of all skill.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.900
All our games come
from gut instinct.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.500
So we do a lot of
concepting and prototyping

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.720
with the game teams.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.760
But the mission is to get
that game into players' hands

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.350
as quickly as possible.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.050
Google Play beta program
is incredibly important.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.930
It's part of the tools
that we use in order

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.660
to allow the team
to make decisions

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.130
so we can then start
moving from gut instinct

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.774
into more informed data.

00:00:48.774 --> 00:00:50.190
ROBIN SCANNELL:
Google Play allows

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.290
you to go through beta
to your soft launch

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.805
right through to global launch,
constantly getting feedback

00:00:54.805 --> 00:00:55.930
from users.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.310
And this allows us
to look at real data

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.870
and make the best possible
game for our players.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.430
During the soft launch
period of "MMX Hill Climb,"

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.900
we were able to utilize
store-listening experiments

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.690
to test different icon colors.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.740
And we found the
best possible icon

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.005
gave a 20% boost
to click-throughs

00:01:13.005 --> 00:01:14.557
in the Play Store.

00:01:14.557 --> 00:01:17.140
SHAUN RUTLAND: "MMX Hill Climb"
is a traditional casual racing

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.640
game.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.730
It has fantastic
social features.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.280
And one of the things we
found through the A/B testing

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.320
is the harder we made
it at certain points,

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.894
the better it retained.

00:01:25.894 --> 00:01:27.310
ROBIN SCANNELL:
Using A/B testing,

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.590
we were able to test
vehicle stability and track

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.890
difficulty for the
start of our game

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.390
in order to best
improve the user

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.460
experience for new players.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.450
In one particular example,
we looked at the difficulty

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.550
of a particular level.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.230
We found this
particular level took

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.770
over 60 attempts,
which was many more

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.390
than other levels in the game.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.720
So this allowed us to focus
on making this level less

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.770
challenging for the
particular point in the game

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.380
at where it was.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.930
Game analytics are so
important because they allow

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.210
us to get out of this room.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.520
And when we're creating
content for updates,

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.229
we know what's been
engaging the players.

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:01.686
SHAUN RUTLAND: "MMX
Hill Climb" has

00:02:01.686 --> 00:02:03.690
had over three million
players on Google Play.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.700
We're seeing engagement times
of around 48 minutes per day,

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.449
so it's proven to be
very addictive, which

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:09.882
is super exciting.

00:02:09.882 --> 00:02:11.590
ROBIN SCANNELL: Using
reviews can show us

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.140
problems that might
not necessarily

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.990
be clear in the analytics.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.804
They can provide opportunities
for new content updates,

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:19.220
or they can suggest
that we've not

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.240
explained particular features
in the game particularly well.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.570
SHAUN RUTLAND: Analytics is
incredibly important to us.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.486
We've been able to improve
our first time user

00:02:26.486 --> 00:02:31.000
experience in past games and
increase out LTV by two times.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.040
Each year, we detain over
10 million new players

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.300
on Google Play.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.300
We've seen revenues increase
in the last four years

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.707
by three times and engagement
is going up and up and up.

00:02:41.707 --> 00:02:43.290
In the long term,
we're really focused

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.190
on making the best
place for developers

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.517
to work to make the best games.

00:02:46.517 --> 00:02:48.350
We're trying to create
the studio of dreams.
