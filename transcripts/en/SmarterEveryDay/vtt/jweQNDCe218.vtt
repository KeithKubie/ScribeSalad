00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.770
- Hey it's me Destin, welcome
back to SmarterEveryDay.

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:04.150
It's coming up on 1 a.m.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.010
I have a problem in my life.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.640
Keeps me up at night, keeps
me away from my family,

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.589
which that's the one
that really bothers me.

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:13.110
It's rendering, look at this.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.070
This particular file
that I've been working

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.752
on right now, nine and a half hours

00:00:17.752 --> 00:00:19.776
worth of rendering on this thing.

00:00:19.776 --> 00:00:22.080
And I've still got an hour to go.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.331
What do you do man?

00:00:23.331 --> 00:00:27.034
I love 4k 60 frames per
second footage, I love it.

00:00:27.034 --> 00:00:29.220
Prince Rupert, look at me.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.498
The rule of Prince Rupert.

00:00:30.498 --> 00:00:31.331
(meowing)

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:34.560
This is a Panasonic GH5, it
shoots fantastic imagery,

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.920
but the problem is, the camera hardware

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.950
is outpacing the computer
rendering hardware.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.570
You put that stuff through
that computer right there,

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.830
it's crunching, like the
computer's pegged out, right?

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.810
And I'm still spending hours
and hours of render time.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.260
I need a better solution.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.750
So I flew to Seattle, there's a guy

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:52.840
named Jon about to pick me up.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.718
He owns a company called Puget Systems,

00:00:54.718 --> 00:00:59.718
and they make specialty computers
for certain applications.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.520
We're gonna go meet with him.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.450
How's it goin'
- Hey how are you?

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.283
- Throw stuff in the back?

00:01:03.283 --> 00:01:04.320
- Yes.
- Awesome.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.470
This is is Jon, he owns a
company called Puget Systems,

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.060
and you're basically the answer

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.780
to everyone's computer problems, right?

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.027
- Well, not all the problems.

00:01:12.027 --> 00:01:13.070
(laughing)

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.640
We don't really ask what
hardware do you want.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.568
We ask what are trying to do?

00:01:16.568 --> 00:01:19.050
And then we can tell you,
what hardware do you want?

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.340
- Oh my gosh.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.700
And so you start from there and then

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.880
build the hardware based on what they say.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.174
- Right, right.

00:01:25.174 --> 00:01:26.007
- What?

00:01:26.007 --> 00:01:28.750
Why is that so revolutionary?

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:29.957
- I don't know, it shouldn't be.

00:01:29.957 --> 00:01:31.230
- It should be!

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.700
You're kinda tucked away here.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.020
It's kind of a nice little area.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.853
- Yeah, we like it.

00:01:34.853 --> 00:01:36.845
- [Destin] So do you guys
personally believe this?

00:01:36.845 --> 00:01:38.270
Is that the deal?

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.500
- Personally believe what?

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.727
- [Destin] This thing that's
on the wall behind you.

00:01:41.727 --> 00:01:43.662
- Oh, well I mean we
have tattoos of it, so --

00:01:43.662 --> 00:01:45.517
- [Destin] You have tattoos of it?

00:01:45.517 --> 00:01:46.854
(laughing)

00:01:46.854 --> 00:01:49.300
Jon took me into the lab,
which is where they test stuff.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.840
His brother Matt and
their co-worker William

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.520
spend the bulk of their time testing

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.570
different combinations
of hardware in this room.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.990
What I found hilarious is that when

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.470
I would ask a very
specific yes or no question

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.550
about performance or hardware to buy,

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.670
it became very clear that every answer

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.900
I received was going
to come with a caveat.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.220
- Sometimes, depends if it's right.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.840
- If it's set up right,
in supported applications.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.500
- Yeah, for that very specific task.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.500
- Depends on exactly what you are doing,

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.250
and the balance between everything.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.730
- [Destin] The caveat
there answers because

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.660
they've actually collected the data.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.440
They perform a suite of benchmark tests

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.270
which are a standardized task you can use

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.014
to see how fast or efficient
a hardware configuration is.

00:02:24.014 --> 00:02:26.180
Over and over they'll run a software test,

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.240
swap out a component and
do it all over again.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.010
Here you can see Matt's
computer is automatically

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.440
running an Adobe Lightroom
benchmark in the background,

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.070
thousands of files are being
manipulated automatically.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.230
They'll do this for hours,
then they'll change out one

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.490
component, in this case a processor,

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:40.710
and they'll do it all over again.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.504
The results of these tests
are a graph like this.

00:02:43.504 --> 00:02:45.810
In this very specific case, you can see,

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.600
testing Photoshop, the data shows

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.900
that this intel I9, whatever,

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.440
however you say this 8 core processor

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.410
is the best you can currently buy.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.980
Which is strange, because it's nearly

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.440
a quarter of the price of the most

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.180
expensive processor they sell.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.260
So the question is how can
an eight core processor

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.220
run fast than a 12 core processor?

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.770
Because I always thought that more cores

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.060
meant it's gonna be faster.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.870
First of all, what does
a core mean, in a CPU.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.450
- It's the computer unit that can

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.170
execute tasks within
your operating system.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.660
And so back before 2005,
it was all single core.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.230
And in order to make your computer faster,

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.992
you just make that chip faster.

00:03:18.992 --> 00:03:22.040
But in around 2005, we were getting

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.030
to the point where Moore's Law

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.160
was starting to taper off,

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.760
and we had to find other ways
to make computers faster.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.640
And so now we're more under
this new thing, Amdahl's Law.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.070
That talks about, okay,
if you have multiple

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.270
cores, multiple processors, that all

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.198
have to work together, it's measurement of

00:03:37.198 --> 00:03:40.710
the efficiency of your software
in being able to do that.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:41.730
- [Destin] What John is saying here,

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.220
is that even if you have
more cores in your processor,

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.650
it only makes your computer
faster if the program

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.980
you're running is more parallelizable.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.510
That's a word, I looked it up.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.380
- One size fits all computing,
those days are over.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.180
It's tailored hardware
for the application.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.240
- In the interest of not making this feel

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.590
like a commercial for your company,

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.210
who else is doing this in the space?

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.390
'Cause I asked you if
I could come talk about

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.820
all this stuff, and you agreed
to build a computer for me.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.610
So let's just be clear about that.

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.320
There's an exchange happening here.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.020
But, who else is doing this?

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.860
Or is this just you.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.710
- Well I mean, I can't say
that there's nobody else

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.900
doing this, but the reason
that we focus so hard on this,

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.180
is that we see, there's such a void.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.590
You'll see a lot of places,
that'll do gaming machines

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.480
and consumer machines, but
this world of work stations

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.300
is like where server meets consumer,

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.600
and it's kinda this blend in the middle,

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.170
and we don't see a lot
of people going after it,

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.003
and that's why we are.

00:04:29.003 --> 00:04:30.890
I could take you out the
warehouse and you could see

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.550
like how we actually put things together,

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.890
do quality control and image
computers and what not.

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.170
- So this is the actual box,
I spec-ed out with William,

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.170
being built right now.

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:40.003
- Yeah.

00:04:40.003 --> 00:04:41.580
- Okay, and so this is the housing.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.390
- Nice little dolly you got going on here.

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.280
Anyone can assemble a computer.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.010
Just like Legos, the hardware is built

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.940
to click together so
you can do it yourself.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.480
But there's a huge difference
in assembling a computer,

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.780
and integrating a well running system.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.150
According to system's engineers,

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.250
all physical components in the world

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.710
interact with four different interfaces.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.750
These four interfaces are spatial,

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.140
material, information, and energy.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.360
A spatial interaction
is how they physically

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.237
connect together, like
Legos clicking together,

00:05:08.237 --> 00:05:10.590
or like with screws or something.

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.380
A material interface would be some type

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.450
of mass that's being moved back and forth

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.120
between different sub-components,
like moving hot air,

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.550
or fluid through a system.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.730
They interact with information by well,

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.210
I mean this is obvious, it's a computer,

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.560
data, moving around, right?

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.010
One of the more interesting interfaces in

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.840
a computer system is energy.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.960
You have electricity and heat transfer

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.250
you have to deal with.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.290
I just realized that that's what you are.

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:34.790
You're computer systems engineers.

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.541
Obviously, you're name says systems,

00:05:36.541 --> 00:05:38.670
but systems engineering is about

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.570
integrating all these different components

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:41.770
and seeing how they work together.

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.603
And if you change one thing,
it effects everything else --

00:05:43.603 --> 00:05:44.539
- Oh yeah, oh yeah.

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:46.750
- Are familiar with the fied
of systems engeineering?

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.730
- Well, I mean I'm empathizing with

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:49.780
what you're saying right now.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.300
Like some example of that,

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.270
almost all modern computer hardware

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:54.390
does thermal throttling.

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.732
So you're probably not
gonna break something

00:05:56.732 --> 00:05:58.360
if you don't cool it adequately.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.810
But you're not gonna get the
full performance out of it.

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.190
And so it isn't enough just for us to see

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.870
is this computer stable,
because it might be stable

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.120
but not running at full speed.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.490
So that's why it's so important

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:09.460
that we actually understand what

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.130
the computer's gonna be used for.

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.480
And that we benchmark it, and we know

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.300
that it's providing the
performance as expected.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.820
- [Destin] Oh, so that's
why the benchmarks

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.130
last six hours, because you
have to hit steady state.

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.150
- [Jon] We have to let
it all heat up, and yeah.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.170
- [Destin] Oh, so it's
not just like processor

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:26.650
steady state, power draw,
it's thermal steady state.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.770
If you wanna check out how
they test these interactions,

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.340
go see the behind the scenes
video on the second channel.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:32.390
What's going on here?

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:34.623
- This is our --

00:06:34.623 --> 00:06:36.760
- [Destin] You have a laser engraver.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.950
- Yeah, we have a couple.

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:40.870
This one we use for
etching logos onto things.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.365
- [Destin] What the heck dude?

00:06:42.365 --> 00:06:44.140
Are you about to do mine?

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:44.973
- [Jon] Yep.

00:06:44.973 --> 00:06:46.061
- [Destin] Really?

00:06:46.061 --> 00:06:46.894
- Uh-huh.

00:06:46.894 --> 00:06:47.760
- [Destin] So you planned all this.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:48.760
- Yes, this was planned.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.120
- [Destin] This was planned.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.232
Look at you, being all fancy schmancy.

00:06:52.232 --> 00:06:54.430
In summary, I have personally fallen

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:56.700
into the trap a time or two
where I went to a website,

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.420
and bought the most expensive machine

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:59.890
I could afford at the time, thinking

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:01.580
that that would buy me time.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.023
Do not do this.

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.286
In my case, I need to
edit, and I wanna sleep.

00:07:08.286 --> 00:07:09.380
(whimsical music)

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:10.680
Can you put this in the...

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:12.453
- Ooh.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.110
- So does this mean you're gonna get

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:16.919
to eat dinner with us a lot more?

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:18.367
- Heh, yeah.

00:07:18.367 --> 00:07:20.924
You have the honor, who's gonna do it?

00:07:20.924 --> 00:07:21.757
- [Boy] What?

00:07:21.757 --> 00:07:22.930
- [Destin] Who's gonna hit the button?

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:27.587
I can't even hear it, can you?

00:07:27.587 --> 00:07:29.140
That's the license agreement.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.750
You're supposed to read that entire thing.

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:33.841
- C'mon, I don't have time.

00:07:33.841 --> 00:07:36.230
- We're getting everything
ready for you Dad.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:37.606
- I just like lookin' at
the back, there's just

00:07:37.606 --> 00:07:38.716
so many boards.

00:07:38.716 --> 00:07:40.030
(laughing)

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.330
- Okay, we have now optimized a computer

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:43.960
for rendering capabilities, I'll tell

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.750
you the benchmark
numbers here in a second.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:49.140
But now, it's time to
optimize the bed for sleep.

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.080
Okay, syncing two cameras up.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:51.984
Here's how it works.

00:07:51.984 --> 00:07:54.870
You're smart, you know
how the internet works,

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:56.540
you can tell if people are
trying to sell you something,

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.620
or if they actually use it, so just listen

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.300
with your smart brain, and you'll hear

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:01.470
what the deal is here.

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:03.623
This video is sponsored by Casper, which

00:08:03.623 --> 00:08:05.630
is stinkin' awesome
because I like to sleep.

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:07.080
This is a Casper mattress, the way

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.160
it works is you order it online,

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.160
casper.com/smarter preferably.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.850
They ship it to your
house, you open the box,

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:16.690
it inflates, it's a really
cool process to watch.

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:18.010
Like a can of biscuits!

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:21.390
I sleep on a Casper
mattress, I have for years,

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:23.310
ever since our fourth
child, it's got certain

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:25.160
amounts of foam in certain locations,

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.420
they've engineered it to
support your body perfectly.

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:28.360
It's the right amount of sink,

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.550
the right amount of bounce, I'm not

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:30.650
just trying to sell you a thing.

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:32.200
I'm happy they're sponsoring,

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.700
but it's just the right way to go.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.200
You can sleep on it for a hundred nights,

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.810
and if you don't like
it, they'll pick it up.

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:37.680
It's that simple.

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:39.040
Alright, so for fifty dollars off,

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:42.334
select Casper mattresses,
go to casper.com/smarter

00:08:42.334 --> 00:08:45.215
and use the promo code
SMARTER at checkout.

00:08:45.215 --> 00:08:47.010
It's worth it, the only
thing you have to lose

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:48.960
is a sleepless night because
if you don't like it,

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:49.793
they'll take it back.

00:08:49.793 --> 00:08:52.729
Check it out, cat approved,
ready Prince Rupert?

00:08:52.729 --> 00:08:54.000
Look at that.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.340
Anyway, I'm Destin.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.183
You're gettin' smarter every day.

00:08:57.183 --> 00:08:58.989
Have a good one.

00:08:58.989 --> 00:08:59.920
I'm gonna get you cat.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.020
So you heard my son talk
about dinner earlier.

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.980
I'm not gonna lie, that kinda hurt.

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:05.624
So I'm very happy to say,

00:09:05.624 --> 00:09:07.670
that after doing this little benchmark,

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:10.910
that 11 hour render is now
down to two and a half hours.

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:12.590
Now I know that's an old computer,

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:14.410
this is a newer computer, but still.

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:16.370
That is a lot of my life back,

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:17.890
and I'm very happy about that.

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:20.404
Just get robes and wizard
hats and be done with this.

00:09:20.404 --> 00:09:23.783
Wizard hat, just put a wizard
hat on top of your head,

00:09:23.783 --> 00:09:25.644
wear robes in here, and like,

00:09:25.644 --> 00:09:27.473
have a dragon statue or something.

00:09:28.525 --> 00:09:30.983
Oh dude, golly that feels good.
