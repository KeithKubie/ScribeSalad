00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.740
- [Instructor] Thomas Piketty's Capital

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.480
in the Twenty-First Century
has been getting a lot

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.679
of attention lately, because
it's addressing an issue

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:10.730
that matters a lot to a lot of folks,

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.540
the issue of income inequality
and wealth inequality.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.670
And my goal here isn't to
have a view on the book,

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.820
to say the book is all
right or it's all wrong,

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.840
but to really use this book as a tool

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.560
to give you the critical thinking tools

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.880
you need to make your own judgment.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.760
The one thing that is
neat about the book is

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.310
that he makes all of the
charts and figures available

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.450
on his website, so all of
these screenshots that I got,

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.450
these are from
piketty.pse.ens.fr/en/capital21c2.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:45.920
And I encourage you to go there

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.850
on your own and to browse these charts,

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.210
because there's a lot
of interesting charts.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.690
But as you do so, always look
at them with both an open

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.900
and a critical eye to see
how, what might make sense,

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.240
or what might not make sense,
or what questions start

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.510
to emerge that you would
like to dig deeper on.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.950
But let me just start with
this chart right over here,

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.740
because this begins to lay
out what might be an issue.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.740
So this is wealth inequality

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.800
in the United States
between 1810 and 2010.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.610
And the way that they're
measuring wealth inequality is

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.390
the share of top decile or
percentile in total wealth.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.280
So here they're saying the
top 1% share of wealth,

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.730
that's this line right over here.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.220
And then you have the top decile,

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.630
the top 10% share in wealth.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.030
So this right over here,
or this data point,

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.390
let me do this in magenta,
this is telling us

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.283
that based on his data,
in 1810 the top 1%,

00:01:42.283 --> 00:01:45.270
the wealthiest 1%, had
roughly, it looks like

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.410
about 25% of the wealth of the country.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.200
And the top 10% had about,
looks like it's almost maybe,

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.120
almost 60% of the wealth of the country.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.830
And then we see how this is trending,

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.700
and it was trending up as
we go through the 1800s

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.340
all the way until the
beginning of the 20th century.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.310
So this is the 19th
century right over here,

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.760
beginning of the 20th century.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.590
And in particular, we have this period

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.190
in the last few decades, the
last two or three decades,

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.600
of the 19th century, the
1800s, that's often known

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.380
as the Gilded Age, the
Gilded Age, that's associated

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.380
with fairly dramatic wealth
inequality, Gilded, Gilded Age.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.830
And one of the questions
that this book raises is,

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.690
are we entering into another Gilded Age?

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.620
Now, if you just look
at this trend line here,

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.620
it's clear that the wealth
inequality isn't as severe

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.220
as it was in the, I guess you
could say, formal Gilded Age.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.530
But it's a question of where is this going

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.640
and is this something that
people should be concerned about?

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.480
So the question is, is
this trend line going to do

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.120
what it did in the last few
decades of the 19th century

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.870
and do something like this, essentially,

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.820
maybe bringing at least
this chart more in line

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.310
with what happened during
the first Gilded Age?

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.470
Or is it going to do something like this?

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.350
Or is it going to do something like that?

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.090
And even if it does do
something like this,

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.020
are we going to have the same realities

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.100
that we had in the first Gilded Age,

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.440
where it's maybe
disproportionate power associated

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.500
with that wealth or whatever else?

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.300
So these are all the types of questions

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.220
that we should be thinking about.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.650
What type of a reality are we going into?

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.160
What is the data that is making
us believe one or the other?

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.090
And what are the policy decisions

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.090
on things like innovation,
or taxation, or education,

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.530
that might lead us one way or another?

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.220
And so, I will dig deeper
into all of those ideas

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.373
over the next few videos in this tutorial.
