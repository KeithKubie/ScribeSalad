00:00:01.101 --> 00:00:03.170
Things are looking grim
for the presidential candidacy

00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:06.306
of swollen Nicolas Cage
character Donald Trump.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.308
(laughter)

00:00:08.342 --> 00:00:10.511
He's responding
to dropping poll numbers

00:00:10.544 --> 00:00:12.880
by softening his rhetoric
and taking a more reasoned,

00:00:12.913 --> 00:00:15.148
compassionate tone
with his speeches.

00:00:15.182 --> 00:00:16.450
Nah, I'm just (bleep) with you.

00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:17.885
He's headed back
to the bat (bleep) buffet

00:00:17.918 --> 00:00:19.887
for another heaping helping
of jingoistic nonsense.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.556
Here he is talking about
his cool new immigration policy.

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.293
I call it "extreme vetting."

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:28.896
I call it <i>extreme...</i>

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:32.266
extreme vetting.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.668
(laughter) -Wait.
I'm a little... I'm a little

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:36.236
unclear on that.
What kind of vetting was that?

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.305
Was that just normal,
run-of-the mill vetting,

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:40.407
or <i>extreme?!</i>

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.142
(applause and cheering)

00:00:42.176 --> 00:00:44.811
-â™ª
-I call it <i>extreme...</i>

00:00:44.845 --> 00:00:47.548
extreme vetting.

00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:49.049
(applause and cheering)

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:50.984
Mm.

00:00:51.018 --> 00:00:53.086
-That works? That works?
-Yeah.

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:56.223
Oh, yeah.

00:00:56.256 --> 00:00:58.025
-The kids love heavy vetting.
-(laughter)

00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:01.128
Now this totally bitching new
policy would require immigrants

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:02.529
to take an intense loyalty test

00:01:02.563 --> 00:01:04.164
to prove that they're
as American as (bleep)

00:01:04.198 --> 00:01:06.066
enough for Trump's U.S. of A.

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:08.135
I guess if this questionnaire
becomes a reality, what's

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:10.070
a question you think Trump
might put on it? Maz Jobrani.

00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:12.139
He's gonna say, "I'm gonna do
some word association with you.

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:13.841
"I'm gonna give you a word.

00:01:13.874 --> 00:01:16.043
"You say the first thing
that comes to your mind.

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:18.278
<i>Allahu Akbar!"</i>

00:01:18.312 --> 00:01:19.646
(laughter)

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.515
-HARDWICK: All right.
-(applause and cheering)

00:01:21.548 --> 00:01:23.483
Gina.

00:01:23.517 --> 00:01:25.385
I think he's gonna ask
some hard questions,

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:26.887
see if he can catch you at it.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.122
He'd be like, "What do you
prefer-- hot dogs and fireworks

00:01:29.156 --> 00:01:31.725
on the Fourth of July,
or September the 11th?!"

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:33.260
(laughter)

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:36.530
-(applause and cheering)
-Ah, oh. Ah, oh. Oh, no!

00:01:36.563 --> 00:01:38.165
Jon Dore.

00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:40.167
He'd probably say,
"Are you a rapist?

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.267
-I mean, Mexican?"
-(laughter)
