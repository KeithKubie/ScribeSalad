 Every year, a large number of government and business leaders gather at the World Economic Forum East Asia Summit to discuss regional agendas and priorities. 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:26.000
 At the East Asia Summit held in Seoul this year, the theme of the discussion will be “The Impact of the Global Economic Crisis on East Asia”. 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:33.000
 But the question that lingers in the minds of many delegates is: "Do geopolitical conflicts exceed the impact of the economic crisis on East Asia?" 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:40.000
