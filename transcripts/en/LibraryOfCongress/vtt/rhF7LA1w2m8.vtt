00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.510
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:18.220
[ Silence ]

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.120
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Hi, good morning,
how's everybody doing, great.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.710 position:56%
All right, thank you all so much for
coming, it's a pleasure to host you,

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.930
I'm Guha Shankar, I'm one of
the folklorists here on staff

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.180
at the American Folk Life
Center, the Library of Congress.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.050
I wanted to thank everybody
who's made it here today,

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.530
colleagues from near and afar.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.250
Especially you folks, you know
you have a long journey in terms

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.550
of where your communities are

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:43.910
and where you want
your communities to go.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.350
We are here to help you
get as far down that road

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.200
as we possibly can,
here at the library.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.440
In just a few minutes I'm going
to turn it over to Betsy Peterson,

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.890
my Chief who's going to welcome
you to the library officially,

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.390
so this is the off the
cuff remarks over here.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.110 position:56%
A couple housekeeping announcements,

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.080
there is some coffee back
there thanks to Rachel and Kara

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.220
and other folks from
MNMH, so help yourselves.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.480
This side coffee, that
side collections,

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.350
just that's the dividing
line, right, so thank you.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.520 position:56%
All right well, welcome again to the
Library of Congress, I'm really glad

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.660
that you all are here, you're going
to hear some exciting presentations

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.390
and we believe we've achieved
critical mass in terms

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.690
of participants, there maybe a
few stragglers here and there

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.980
but I'm sure as part of your
homework you will fill them

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:35.100
in on what happened this morning,
including the visit to the bowels

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.570
of the Jefferson Building
for some of you

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.640
and the lovely electrical closet.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.210
I can take you on later
on if you want to, okay.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.090
And so let me turn it over right
now to my Director, Betsy Peterson

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.510
from the American Folk Life Center.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.870
[ Applause ]

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.490
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: I think you're
journey was made much longer this

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.870
morning by the commute
but welcome to Washington,

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.350
D.C. it wouldn't be an
authentic experience

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.730
without an adventure on the Metro.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.500
So as Guha said my names is
Betsey Peterson I'm the Director

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.950
of the American Folk Life Center
here at the Library of Congress.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.720
And on behalf of the
librarian, Dr. Carla Haden I want

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:25.020
to welcome you all here and welcome
all participants to the 2017 Breath

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.300
of Life Archival Institute
for Indigenous Languages.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.140
Thank you for all of the
efforts you make to revitalize

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.430 position:56%
and sustain the cultural heritage
traditions of your home communities.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.440
We at the library are deeply
honored so be working with you

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.000
in the preservation
and access effort.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.380
I know you will have many
appointments over the next week

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.860
to ten days at other archival
facilities throughout Washington.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.730
D.C. and very shortly you're
going to learn a lot more

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.520
about the libraries research
centers and the resources

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.610
that we have housed here.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.660
But I thought it would be
interesting for you to keep

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.820 position:56%
in mind a couple of things about
the library to give you a little bit

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.940
of context and a little bit of
context about the collections here.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.950 position:56%
That our acquisitions and collection
management policies, quote,

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.270
cover virtually every
discipline and field

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.370
of study include the entire range
of different forms of publications

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.720
and media for recording
and storing knowledge.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.970
We are a library inspired to be
a library that holds the breadth

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.010
of human knowledge here around us.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.220
So what does that mean
in real numbers,

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.510
well as of 2016 the library
collections numbered 164

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.480
million items.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.910
And when I say items I mean
we collect and preserve a wide

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.800
and comprehensive range of formats.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.160
So for instance this
list includes more

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.770
than 38.6 million catalogue books,

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:09.090
and other printed materials
in 474 languages.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.250
Many of which are from indigenous
communities around the world

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.370
and more than 70 million
manuscripts.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.900
We also have the largest rare
book collection in North America.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.740
And the world's largest collection
of legal materials, films, maps,

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.860
sheet music and sound recordings.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.260
And since we are on this
topic of oldest and rarest

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.700
and biggest I did want to mention
that the American folk Life Center

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:41.770
which has nearly 6 million items
also houses the world's largest

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.390
oldest surviving recordings
of native peoples.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.870 position:56%
And that being of the
anthropologist, Jessie Walter Fuchs,

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.360
wax cylinders of the
Passamaquoddy community of Maine,

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.100
whom were recorded in 1890.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.970
We have several thousand
such cylinders not

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.950
to mention other ancient
technologies

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.010
and over the last couple of years
using cutting edge digital sound

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.600
capture and restoration
tools we are transferring

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.340
and in some cases retransferring
some of this fragile media.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:21.370
Cylinders instantaneous disks,
paper to today's digital format.

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.280 position:56%
And in the case of the Passamaquoddy
we are working with the tribe

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.780
to acquire culturally based
information and description

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.700
about the songs and the stories
that were recorded so long ago

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.400
for the LC's catalog records.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.610
This is an ongoing project
and we are already hearing

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.820
about some exciting linguistic
and cultural discoveries,

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.570
the Passamaquoddy community has
made since they began listening

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:51.600 position:56%
to the recordings a few months ago
and it's been very exciting to watch

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.390
and engage in all of this.

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:57.770 position:56%
I mention this project, however,
because a few of the language groups

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.260
that are represented here
will be listening to materials

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.370
at the AFC meeting room
which is on the other side

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.580
of this building on this floor.

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.430 position:56%
And you will be listing to materials
that are just la few years younger

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.680
than the 1890 Passamaquoddy
materials.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.820
Judith Gray our head of
reference, our head of reference,

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:29.150
our head wrangler, our head I don't
know, fountain of wisdom and chief,

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:34.610
she will be in the reading room
helping you and please corner her,

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.560
talk to her she is a
wealth of knowledge

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.610
about the collections that we have.

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.280
She's an incredible
resource for you all.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:48.000
So, now I'm going to turn
over the program to the folks

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.190
who can really tell you much more
about the collections that are here

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:57.890
and that we hope you
will use and engage with.

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:02.320
We have with us, today Barbara
Bair from the Manuscripts Division

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.530
and Barbara Natanson and Katherine
Blood from Prints and Photographs.

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:10.470
Jay Sweany head of the Humanities
and Social Science Division

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:14.970
and Carla Davis-Castro from the Law
Library and of course Judith Gray

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.150
from the American folk Life Center.

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:22.020 position:56%
And sincere thanks to all of these
folks for being part of this program

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.370
and for bringing some of the
materials for you all to see.

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:30.250
But importantly I also want
to express deep appreciation

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.500
to the Breath of Life Institute
staff and our colleagues.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:38.750
Gabriela Perez-Baiz [phonetic],
Darrel Baldwin, Rachel Vogel

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:42.870
and especially a guiding
light Dr. Leanne Hinton,

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:46.360
the founding vision
behind the BOL Institute.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.310
We've enjoyed our participation
in all of the institutes

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:53.400
for several years and we
look forward to meeting more

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.010
and to a continued
collaboration with all of you.

00:07:56.010 --> 00:08:02.630 position:56%
You are welcome any time here and on
that note I will thank you all again

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:05.710
and turn everything over to Jay,

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:09.510
Sweany to begin the
rest of the day, Jay.

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:13.900
[ Applause ]

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.990
&gt;&gt; James Sweany: Well, thank
you and good morning and welcome

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:17.290
to the Library of Congress.

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:21.020
My hope in the few minutes
that we have together is

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:23.580
to demystify using the library.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:27.510
You've heard of the 164 million
items in the collections,

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:30.780
how do you get started and so
I wanted to share a few things

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:34.460 position:56%
with you as you look to get started.

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:39.240
It's something to remember
perhaps as you go about the course

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.740
of your research especially
when you're here at the library,

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:47.370
is try to discern what can you only
do here at the Library of Congress?

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:51.440
There are offerings that we have
on the website, digital offerings,

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:55.850
those things when you return
home you can view and pursue

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:58.640
but what we're trying
to do is help you focus

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:02.840
on what you can only do
here to optimize your times.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.750
I represented a vision
that is best represented

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:09.000
by the main reading room,
it's just upstairs to go

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.300
to the main reading room all you
need is reader registration card.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:16.810
A card that if you haven't
already obtained you can do

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:19.880
so across the main reading room
upstairs on the first floor,

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:23.120
but you'll need the card to
go into the reading room.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.160
We'll talk about the importance
of the card in a moment

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:30.500
in requesting materials, but
upstairs also is our microform

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.580
and electronic resource area.

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:37.460
The library has invested
much resources

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:40.340
and purchasing electronic
data bases and some

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:43.430
of these maybe helpful
in your research.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:49.430
Again, online offerings but
again our focus here will be

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:53.740 position:56%
on how we can help you, probably
the greatest clues that we can share

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:57.110
with you is involve the
reference staff in your research.

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:59.900
You'll probably never
know what you missed

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.780
without involving the
reference librarians.

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:04.240
There are collections
that are not obvious,

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.910
that are not in the catalogue,

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:09.030
clues that our reference
staff can provide you

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:12.170
on locating materials
here at the library.

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:15.780
Also if you find yourself
not knowing where to go

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:19.710
and you'll hear much about
different collections,

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:21.500
different areas of the library.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:25.620
These areas may be very relevant
for you but if you're confused

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:28.490
about where to go again you can
come to the main reading room,

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:31.970
our reference librarians are
also expert in the resources here

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:34.240
at the library to be able
to point you to the area

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:37.060
of the library holding
those collections.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:41.400
So again, a few stop maybe going
up stairs to our main reading room.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:46.880 position:56%
To have a conversation with our
librarians, one of the key resources

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:50.370
that organizes materials of
the libraries, Many Nations,

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:54.390
this was published about 20 years
ago but is very valuable in helping

00:10:54.390 --> 00:11:00.750
to organize the various indigenous
collections here at the library.

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:05.360
Many Nations goes through
the various reading rooms,

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.800
what's in the general collections

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.050
and the various specialty
collections.

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:11.280
We have copies of this
in the main reading room

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:15.230
and I hope you've had a
chance to browse this.

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:19.990
As you talk to a reference staff
again we can be very helpful

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:22.100
in orienting you to the library.

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.670
The library is a close stack
library meaning the you'll have

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:28.850
to identify what you're looking
for and make a request for it

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:31.490
and it's brought out to
you in the reading room.

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:35.900
So it involves a search
to identify what's needed.

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:41.240
We can help you with the
subject headings, this will vary,

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:46.200
sometimes they're not the obvious
and they have changed over years.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:50.160
And so we can help you identify
what is the controlled vocabulary.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:57.120
Say, for community or for
subheadings to search further

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.310
of course searching our
periodical literature.

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:05.710
And also to navigate
subscription data bases.

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:10.380
But also what might be helpful
is our reference specialist have

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:16.370
specialization in many areas and
can work with you, bibliographies

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:19.610
and guides, other materials
that again may not be

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:25.180
in the online catalogue and
findable in say a cursory search.

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:31.130
One of the fortes of the library
is having collected materials the

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:35.810
history of this country,
particularly of reports,

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:40.410
publications, the Bureau of
American Ethnology for example.

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:43.270
And a variety of subject areas

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:49.170
that you might find useful,
very multidisciplinary.

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:53.150
For example, just to
identify publications

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:59.070
that may not be obvious,
being familiar with the Bureau

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:03.480
of American Ethnology, the annual
report for example the index is

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.640
up in our main reading room.

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:14.490
Being able to identify a specific
study, research that has been done.

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:18.330
This for example, focuses
on the Catawba Indians

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:22.680
and specialized studies
that might be relevant.

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:27.540
One of the advantages of searching
here at the library is that many

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:30.580
of the older publications
you're looking in print form.

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:34.430
Not on microfilm and
that is advantage

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:38.360
of being here at the library.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:42.330
We do have web resources
that again will help you

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:45.110
and guide you generally but again

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:51.530
for your specific searching please
involve the references librarians.

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:56.100
A word about our microfilm reading
room, again which is upstairs,

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:59.840
what is very helpful is to tap
into the research of others.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:05.560
And the Library of Congress has an
almost comprehensive collections

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.020
of U.S. doctoral dissertations,
thanks in great part

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:09.890
to the university of
microfilm and the relationship

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:12.370
that the library has
had for many years.

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:13.970
Being able to tap into the research

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:16.550
of other scholars might
be very helpful

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:19.000
in pursuing your own research.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.020
Early state records,
pamphlets in American history,

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:26.230
British manuscripts projects,
also oral history collections.

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:29.940
Again, items that will
not be evident

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:32.470
in the libraries online catalogue.

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:37.140
And again throwing out a few key
words here, just perhaps as clues

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:40.080
to know what to ask the
reference librarians.

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:45.630
Now we don't have time
to go into detail as far

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:47.410
as searching the online
catalogue other

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:53.010 position:56%
than to say our reference librarians
are experts and can work with you

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:57.480
as regarding the various
aspects of searching.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:01.470
The best and most efficient
way is subject headings

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:05.920
and through the subject
headings both online and working

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:09.080
with our staff, these
are some examples.

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:13.610
Usually most specific is
searching by the community and then

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:16.770
under which you'll
find many subheadings.

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:22.900
For example just as an example here
the Chumash language you'll find

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:28.530
subdivisions by geography and
also the type of material.

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:33.210 position:56%
So we have here southern California,
conversation phrase books,

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:37.410
dictionaries, bilingual materials.

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:39.980
But I also mention that we do have,

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:44.200
that will not be individually
catalogued materials that are part

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:47.010
of what we call a lesser
known language collection.

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:51.590
Meaning that their catalogue
collection level by language

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:55.720
and they consist of boxes
that simply contain materials

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.790
that had been gathered
together on a specific language.

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:03.550
These maybe hymnals,
pamphlets, translations

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:09.220
and so they're held offsite but
talk to our reference librarians

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:13.070
about again the collection level,

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:18.170
lesser known language
collection to see examples.

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:24.130
No appointment is necessary to
search in the main reading room,

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:28.400
simply present yourself
during our hours of operation.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:33.020
Searching further, this is just
an example of a publication

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:36.040
that came us using
the subject heading,

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.280
how do you request the item.

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:39.640
You're able to click on that link,

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:44.790
request the item it will give you
the call number and you're able

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:46.450
to request in a reading room.

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:48.750
Now the advantage of
having a researchers card is

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:50.740
that you're able, to,
once you register,

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:54.070
you're able to establish an account
and then you're able to go in

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:59.800
and request materials even off-site
in anticipation of your looking

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.460
at this here at the library.

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:05.820
So if you haven't already received,
please obtain a researcher's card

00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:08.450
and then again you can
establish and account and then

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:11.990
as you're browsing the
online catalog you're able

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:13.300
to request these materials.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.430
So as you go back to
your hotel and what not,

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:18.320
being able to search what's
relevant, what might be helpful

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:21.210
and then go ahead and
request those materials.

00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:24.890
Materials in this building take
about 45 minute to an hour,

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:29.730
if they're in another building,
probably double that time.

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:32.880
Some materials are held
offsite, we've run out of space

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:36.360
on Capitol Hill and so some
materials are held offsite

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:39.320
so you're looking probably
at 24, 48 hour.

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:42.870
The librarians again can help
you say manage times as far

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:47.430
as these requests but it's very
helpful knowing what you're looking

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:51.280
for and being able to make
these requests and then plan

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.670
for your visit when you
return to the library.

00:17:53.670 --> 00:18:02.330
You may have questions and those
perhaps if you don't ask here

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:04.000
and you return home
to your communities

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.940
and ask, we have Ask a Librarian.

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:10.580
That you're able to ask us follow
up questions, we're not able

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:13.000
to independently undertake
your research

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.710
but we can give you
search strategies,

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:17.400
help you identify what's
here at the library.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:21.170
Where you may need to
go outside the library

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:25.720
but a reference specialist can
guide you through Ask a Librarian.

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.340
But that's our basic search

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:32.820
if you have questions I have
my email there, JSWE@loc.gov,

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:36.700
but again please visit us
in our main reading room

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:40.250
so we can work with
you individually.

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:44.030
Now to continue I'd like
to introduce my colleague,

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:47.510
Barbara Bair from the
Manuscript Division.

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:54.210
[ Applause ]

00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:58.510
&gt;&gt; Barbara Bair: I want to add
my welcome to the ones from Betsy

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:01.200
and Jay we're so pleased to
have you here at the Library

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.530
of Congress I hope all of
you have a very fruitful time

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:06.200
to doing your research
in Washington,

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:11.060
D.C. The manuscript
division is just one

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:14.930 position:56%
of several special collections
divisions at the Library of Congress

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:16.940
that have their own readings rooms

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:20.090
to serve certain formats
of primary materials.

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:26.550
In the manuscript division over
all we have some 63 million items

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:29.400
in nearly 12,000 collections.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.320
The collections are mostly
made up of personal papers

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:35.400
and some records of organizations.

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:39.600
They mainly contain hand written
or typed correspondence, journals

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:44.450
and diaries, account books, scrap
books, drafts and other types

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:47.990
of writings or records
such as field notes.

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:50.410
You can find out more
about conducting research

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:52.920
in the manuscript division
by going online

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:56.670
to the manuscript division web
page which you see on the screen,

00:19:56.670 --> 00:20:02.620
which is within the Library
of Congress, loc.gov portal.

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:05.330
Most of our finding
aids are registers

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:08.370
for the larger collections
are available online

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:10.780
through that manuscript
division website.

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:14.710
And it's a good idea to plan your
research in advance by looking

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:17.570
at the finding aids and
jotting down what boxes

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:21.180
or microfilm reels you
may want to look at.

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:25.710
Keep in mind that some of our
collections are stored offsite

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:29.040
and you may need to place an
order in advance of your visit.

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:32.310
All you need to do is to go to
that manuscript division website,

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:36.020 position:56%
call the number and let the
librarian who answers the phone know

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:40.050
that you're coming and they can let
you know if it's onsite or offsite.

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:42.000
And there's also the
listing on the website

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.360
that you can check for yourself.

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:49.800
For preservation reasons the
manu8script division requires

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.740
that if a collection
has been microfilmed

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:56.330
or digitized you must use the
microfilm or the digital version

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:59.860
for your research even when you
are here onsite in Washington,

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:04.950
D.C. Exceptions can sometimes be
made for viewing physical items

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:09.770
through consultation with a
collection curator or specialist.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.630
When looking for first language
evidence it may be difficult

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:19.660
to drill down to find specific
materials you may want to pursue.

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:23.430 position:56%
You'll also need to be prepared that
we may have little or nothing by way

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:27.600
of documentation, depending on
which particular tribal heritages

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.540
and language groups
you are studying.

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:33.110
We actively seek to
acquire new collections

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:36.470
that can help fill the many
gaps in linguistic evidence

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:39.330
for different tribal
groups and subgroups

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:42.460
and update older materials
in our collections.

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:46.650
At the same time we honor
tribal libraries and archives

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:47.950
and encourage those working

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:51.790
on language reclamation
and revitalization.

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:56.080
To document and preserve
locally and regionally.

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:59.410
For our purposes today I'm going
to highlight some examples form,

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:03.340
manuscript collections that deal
specifically with ethnology,

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:05.820
language and linguistics,
vocabularies

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:08.390
and materials in translation.

00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:11.970
The manuscript division has
many materials pertaining

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:13.640
to Native American history.

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:17.080
Particularly in the period
stemming from European colonization

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:19.840
to the early 20th century.

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:23.050
The division has first
voices materials but the bulk

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:27.610
of materials are filtered
through non-indigenous speakers.

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:29.610
Almost all the materials originate

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:33.240
from incidents of syncretic
encounter.

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:37.150
Examples include bibles and prayer
books translated by missionaries

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:42.140
or school teachers such as this
18th century Micmac prayer book

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:45.460
which was written in hieroglyphics
and which was purchased

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:49.660
by the Library of Congress
as a single item in 1907.

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:55.590
There are records from religious
and educational institutions

00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:59.400 position:56%
such as this Aleut primer from 1846.

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:03.030
With alphabet in Aleut
Russian and church Slovanik.

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:06.340
From my Russian Orthodox great
Catholic church of American,

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:09.460
Diocese of Alaska collection.

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:16.640 position:56%
These records stem from 1733 to
1938 and are available on microfilm.

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:19.480
The collection includes
documentation of the administration

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:22.480
of Indians schools in
Alaska, photographs

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:26.140
and Aleutian translations
of the gospels.

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:28.820
You should also look for
early printed translations

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:34.480
of Christian religious text into
Indian languages that are available

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:37.990
in the rare book and
special collections division.

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:43.320
Accounts of exploration,
expedition and trade routes

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:46.320
in the manuscript division
can include vocabulary lists

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.690
and other linguistic evidence.

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:53.010
An example is this vocabulary
from Joseph Ingrapham 1790

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:58.410
to 1792 journal of the journey
of the ship Hope form New England

00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:02.730
to the Pacific Northwest
Washington Isles and Nootka sound.

00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:07.930
So that's a combination of upper
Native American first nation

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:09.520
material in it.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:13.240
The Ingrapham journal has been
published and it is also online

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:16.600
through the world digital
library which you can also find

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:20.130
through the Library
of Congress website.

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:23.500
The manuscripts division Henry
Rowe Schoolcraft papers include

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:25.540
25,000 items.

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:28.020
Among these are writings
of the Chippewa poet

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:33.660 position:56%
and writer Jane Johnston Schoolcraft
who lived from 1800 to 1842.

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:35.300
And the field work
that was conducted

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:38.640
by the members of her,
Johnston family.

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:42.090
The Johnston's were instrumental
in providing the personal

00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:45.630
and social connections for
gatherings cultural field notes

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:50.320
for preparing Chippewa
grammars and for the translation

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:52.910
of oral history, legends and tales.

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:57.460
So it exists in primary
format in that collection.

00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:00.600
Their field work provided the
foundation of the published work

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:04.070
of Henry Rowe Schoolcraft,
Jane Johnston's husband

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:08.250
who was the ethnologist and Indian
agent in Michigan Territory.

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:11.530
And at the literary magazine that
the Schoolcraft's produced together

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:16.020
in the 1820's and we have
the magazine in rough draft

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:19.200
within the Schoolcraft papers.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:22.720
The collection also includes
some indigenous vocabularies

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:28.120
from non-Chippewa sources including
some Mandan material and notes

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:32.820
on the Cush-an tribe of the
south Yuba River near Sacramento,

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:35.320
above Sacramento in California.

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:40.110
The Schoolcraft collection
is available on microfilm,

00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:44.690
it is also offered as a
documentary electronic resource

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:47.380
through the [inaudible]
Groups Indigenous Peoples

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:50.660
of North America archive.

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:54.090
This is a proprietary site,
in other words the library has

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:56.160
to pay to have it available.

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:59.160
The Library of Congress
does subscribe to the site

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:02.560
and you can access it through
the electronic resources portal

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:06.630
on computer terminals on the
Manuscript Division, Reading room

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:10.990
or elsewhere within the library but
you can't get to it from offsite.

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:16.790
There are a variety of Native
American history materials among

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:18.770
what we call in the
Manuscript Division,

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:21.830
our miscellaneous manuscript
collections.

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:25.660 position:56%
These are very small collections we
store onsite in the Madison building

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:29.210
and some of them are also
available on microfilm.

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:32.610
Examples include the
Assiniboine or Stony First Nation

00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:35.370
and Dakota Sioux Indian collection.

00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:39.790
It contains only four items but
these include a vocabulary list

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:41.460
with English equivalents.

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:44.080
And a translation of the
Lord's prayer collected

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:48.940
from a First Nation
speaker in Canada in 1886.

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:51.870
Both the Albert Gallatin

00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:56.060 position:56%
and the Indian languages
miscellaneous manuscript collections

00:26:56.060 --> 00:27:00.790
focus primarily on Indian tribes
of Mexico and central America.

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:03.700
While the John Kirk Townsend
collection has glossaries

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:05.870
of Indian words recorded

00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:09.620
by an Anglo-American
ornithologist during exploration

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:13.350
of the Pacific Northwest in 1835.

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:19.720
The Charles Leon papers within the
Pennell-Whistler papers include

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:25.040
field work for Leland's 1884 book,
Algonquin Legends of New England.

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:30.930
Primarily Wabanaki, Penobscot,
Passamaquoddy and Micmac.

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:34.420
Leland was the uncle of
Elizabeth Robins-Pennell

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:39.000
and his materials came to the
library as part of her papers.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.920
They include vocabularies
collected by folklorists Abby Alger

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:45.960
who was author of, Work on
Algonquin Languages of Quebec

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:47.820
and northern New England.

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:51.330
And by a Passamaquoddy ethnologist
and Native American member

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:54.830
of the Maine state
legislature, Louis Mitchell

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:58.730
who lived from 1847 to 1930.

00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:01.900
The divisions work progress
administration federal writer's

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:06.140
program and Schoolcraft collections
also include documentation

00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:09.690
of Indian pageants,
tales and legends.

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:12.750
Alger's published works are
available electronically

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:14.450
through the Hathi Trust.

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:17.090
And you can access
the Hathi Trust links

00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:21.340
through the online catalogue
records for particular collections.

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:26.410
The papers of ethnologist C. Hart
Merriam are our most important

00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:30.100
source for Indian languages
of the Pacific Coast region.

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:34.940
Merriam who lived from 1855
to 1942 began his career

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:37.530
as a naturalist and zoologist.

00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:41.630
He was one of the participants
in the 1889 Harriman expedition

00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:46.080 position:56%
to Alaska, we also have the
Harriman papers here at the library.

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:49.870
In the later part of his life
Merriam devoted his efforts

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:54.360
to field work studies or Indian
peoples of California and Nevada.

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:57.130
His vocabulary field work
was an extension of his work

00:28:57.130 --> 00:29:00.390
with the United States Department
of Agriculture with backing

00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:05.540
from the Harriman fund of
the Smithsonian in 1910.

00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:08.500
The [inaudible] check lists and
word and phrase field work records

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:15.340
in the Merriam collection stem
primarily from 1904 to 1938.

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:20.180
Additional Merriam collection
stem primarily from 1904 to 1938.

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:25.160
Additional Merriam materials
are at the Bancroft Library

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.250
at the University of California.

00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:31.930
And ideally if you're doing work
on Merriam you should work both

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:36.640
at the Library of Congress and
at the University in Berkeley.

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:39.950
Merriam's California
journals which we have here

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:42.900
at the library are
available on microfilm.

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:44.860
Boxes 24 through 47

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:50.540
of the Manuscripts Division
collection contains the [inaudible]

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:57.000
field work from throughout
California,

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.860 position:56%
parts of Oregon and parts of Nevada.

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:07.300
Including word lists for Chumash,
Hupa, Me-Wuk and Pomo subgroups.

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:12.520
The Merriam papers also
includes handcrafted maps

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:17.300
of the Indian linguistic groups
of California and for those of you

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:20.390
who have already looked
at the table,

00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:23.320
I've got some of the
physical vocabulary lists

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:26.240
from California Indian groups
and also one of the map

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:28.290
that you see on the screen here.

00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:30.030
We have several other maps that are
in oversized physical collection

00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:31.330
in the manuscript division
and if you come

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:32.630
to do research we can
get those out to you.

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:34.430
That's it, thanks very much.

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:37.510
[ Applause ]

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:44.630
[ Background noise ]

00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:46.730
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: And next up
we have Carla Davis-Castro

00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:48.800
from the Law Library
who's going to talk to us

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:51.100
about the Indigenous Law Portal.

00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:57.610
&gt;&gt; Carla Davis-Castro:
Good morning, Buenos Dias.

00:30:57.610 --> 00:31:00.200
Thank you to the bringer of
coffee I hope it's helping

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:01.920
to keep everybody awake.

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:03.350
I know it's a lot to absorb.

00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:07.610 position:56%
My name Carl Davis-Castro, I work at
the Law Library and I wanted to talk

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:11.940
about the indigenous law portal
which is a totally online source,

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:19.320
so there's nothing more to look
up, other than what you find here.

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:22.960
There's some things that we've
digitized here but actually a lot

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:27.030
of them are in better conditions
digitized than they are physically.

00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:31.580 position:56%
And so seeing it online is sometimes
better than seeing it in person just

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:33.860
because how you can zoom and such.

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:38.230
So I want to talk a little bit
about just sort of the basics

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:41.090
of how librarians organize
information.

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:45.920
There's sort of two main systems or
main tools, we use subject headings

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:49.610
which was mentioned earlier
research is going to be

00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:54.540
under Indians of North America.

00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:59.090 position:56%
The conversation about how that name
came to be is one for another time

00:31:59.090 --> 00:32:03.170
but for classification, a lot of
what you would look at would be

00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:07.120
in class E which is
history of the Americas.

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:12.870
My colleague Dr. Yolanda Goldberg
was interested in finding a place

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:18.640
for indigenous law because for
most of the libraries history

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:21.290
and library history
in the United States,

00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:23.380
all indigenous things
was grouped together

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:26.540
under class E no matter
what the subject was.

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:29.340
And for her this was
problematic, she didn't think

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:33.450
that indigenous law should be next
to basket weaving and pottery just

00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:35.450
because it was the same tribe.

00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:40.470
And so she has been working on
a new classification system, K,

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:47.060
class K is where law lives, we have
sort of class K for western law

00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:50.050
and she is in the process
of creating KI

00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:53.360
which is indigenous
law of the Americas.

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:57.170
North America is done and we're
working on Central America,

00:32:57.170 --> 00:32:59.400
we will go into South America.

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:02.820
So this is the first time that
indigenous law is being pulled

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:07.510
out away from other cultural and
anthropological type materials

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:11.770
and putting it in a different area.

00:33:11.770 --> 00:33:16.020
So one area was this
classification which is

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:18.360
to deal with print materials.

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:20.600
When you have books that are
published, things that come in

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:24.260
and you say where am I going to
put this physical book on a shelf.

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:27.310
But we know that there's a lot
of information that doesn't go

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:30.130
on a shelf, some things that
never will go on a shelf

00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:33.750
because they're born
digital as we say.

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:37.060
So the idea of the indigenous
law portal was born to try

00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:41.410
to organize information that you
see online that is never going

00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:43.880
to come into our book shelf.

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:46.540
So just to talk a little bit

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:49.540
about library tools the
way classification works.

00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:52.230
We have number 1, name
authority records.

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:56.050 position:56%
And these are you know, library
records that are created for people,

00:33:56.050 --> 00:34:01.650
organizations, places and the way
you create these authority records

00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:06.280
is based on research.

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:10.160
Once you have these name
authority records you have lots

00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:12.660
of little pieces, like
puzzle pieces but the idea is

00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:17.400 position:56%
to organize the information so that
someone can find it in a logical way

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:21.170
so we have classification which
I was showing you earlier,

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:25.840
class E history of the
Americas or of North America.

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:30.740
And for example law, and so this
classification is structured

00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:33.590
according to hierarchical
relationships.

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:37.300
Right so we have Indians of
North America for the hemisphere,

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:40.640
Indians of North America, Indians
of Mexico and Central America,

00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:44.220
Indians of South America and
then within each sub region.

00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:47.810
Right so you move down
the hierarchy.

00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:53.850
For a lot of classes like class
E they're organized by subject,

00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:58.100
law is divided by geography because
law emanates from a jurisdiction

00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:00.740 position:56%
from a place, the law of this place.

00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:07.440
So in our case law is organized by
geography to reflect jurisdictions.

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:10.430
So I was talking about
these puzzle pieces,

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:11.730
these name authority records.

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:14.440
So here's one that was created,
what had been interesting

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:17.950
about this project is that
there were a lot of tribes.

00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:21.980 position:56%
There were a lot of councils, there
were a lot of advocacy organizations

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:26.280
that never had name
authority records ever.

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:30.060 position:56%
And so part of this project has
been creating name authority records

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:35.350
to establish these entities
as groups, as places,

00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:38.150
as governments within
library systems.

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:41.010
So we can create name authority
records here at the Library

00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:44.460
of Congress and then
they also go into sort

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:47.760
of a global name authority pool.

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.220
So once this is created for example

00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:51.760
for the Shoshone-Bannock
tribes of Ft.

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.290
Hall reservation of Idaho,

00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:56.610
once we've created it here it
will then go into a global pool

00:35:56.610 --> 00:36:00.860 position:56%
and this is something that libraries
all over the world can access.

00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:02.750
For North America alone
we've created

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:05.040
over 2,000 name authority records.

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:08.520
These are peoples,
governments, that did not exist

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:12.520
in the library world before.

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:16.710 position:56%
So as you can see here we've got the
name of the tribe and then as you go

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:21.040
down we have alternate names,
we know a history of names,

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:24.340 position:56%
complicated, people got called
different things by different people

00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:26.930
at different times so as
much as possible we try

00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:32.460
to have alternate names here to
make each group more findable.

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:35.570
And just where indigenous
law sits in sort

00:36:35.570 --> 00:36:40.330
of the overall thing I mentioned,
class K. K at the top is global,

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:43.630
so here's the geographical
hierarchy, yes.

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:46.520
&gt;&gt; Does this [inaudible]?

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:50.710
&gt;&gt; Carla Davis-Castro: That's
a really good question.

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:52.900
&gt;&gt; Indigenous actually [inaudible].

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:54.360
&gt;&gt; Carla Davis-Castro:
That's a good question,

00:36:54.360 --> 00:37:02.230 position:56%
so under class K western nations
states law we do have federal Indian

00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:06.040
law but that's under class K
because federal Indian law emanates

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:08.470
from Congress right
across the street.

00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:10.650
That's not indigenous,
that's federal Indian law,

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:14.170
about indigenous peoples
but not of them.

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:18.870
So indigenous law really is
what comes out of the councils,

00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:24.650 position:56%
how are indigenous peoples governing
themselves and our focus is today.

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:25.950
So not historically --

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:29.020
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] reorganization act,

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:32.400
cover [inaudible] were
forced upon us

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:33.920
and the fact the government
[inaudible] different

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:36.570
from traditional government

00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:42.280
so laws are you [inaudible]
are you putting traditional,

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:48.290
very traditional laws because to
me there are two different things.

00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:51.110
&gt;&gt; Carla Davis-Castro: Well,
as much as we can find,

00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:56.680
so it's true that those governments
were imposed, in you know,

00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:58.860
especially around the 1920's, 30's.

00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:02.740
But a lot of those governments
are still operational today,

00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:05.340
they have councils,
they have websites,

00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:07.660
they've taken on some
sort of agency.

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:12.350
So we do include those because even
though the cede maybe was an act

00:38:12.350 --> 00:38:16.810
of Congress here, if
they still live on today

00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:19.750
and they're making decisions
and they have governments.

00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:26.300
Then that at some point, I mean
100 years later reflects the

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:28.370
tribes decisions.

00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:31.790
So for now we do include
those as much

00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:36.440
as we can find other traditional
materials we do include them.

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:41.490
The idea is that federal Indian
law is not NKI, that's NK,

00:38:41.490 --> 00:38:44.260
it's not part of indigenous law.

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:47.700
So the Acts of Congress
are not on this side.

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:51.330
&gt;&gt; What about treaties?

00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:56.310
&gt;&gt; Carla Davis-Castro:
So treaties we're working

00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:58.720
on creating the name
authority records

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:04.220
like I said this is something
that we're working on right now.

00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:07.260
I think the focus has
been on Canadian treaties

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:10.870
and so yes those are examples
where technically they could live

00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:15.030
on both sides, right, they could
live on the K side or the KI side.

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:18.240
Normally we try to put it in both
and have a bridge saying you know,

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:21.680
this represents sovereignty,
autonomy of two different groups

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:24.150
that came to sign a treaty.

00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:27.780
So yes, that would absolutely
be part of indigenous law.

00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:35.340
So we tried to be sort of
use terms that are reflective

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:41.220 position:56%
of national realities because the
way people talk about indigenous law

00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:44.120
and issues in Canada is
different from the U.S.

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:45.420
and it's different from Mexico.

00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:49.000 position:56%
I was brought on to do research for
central America so now we're getting

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:57.770
into terms in Spanish, this is just
an example of similar structure

00:39:57.770 --> 00:39:59.300
for how you would find information.

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:01.460
But the terms are slightly
different.

00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:07.530
So this is what the home page looks
like for the indigenous law portal,

00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:09.750
as I said KI is geographic

00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:12.340
so you find the group
that you're looking for.

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:13.820
You find the council
that you're looking

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:18.870
for through maps to
move hierarchically.

00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:22.670
So we started with North
America as you might guess.

00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:26.030
Here at the Library of Congress
the area that we're strongest in is

00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:31.050
for the United States and the
Library of Congress has digitized

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:36.040
over 400 Constitutions
that were here.

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:39.490
Like you had mentioned a lot
of those governments and a lot

00:40:39.490 --> 00:40:43.520
of the constitutions are coming out
of the 20's and 30's but not all

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:48.980
of them we have materials from
Cherokee, Chickasaw and the Choctaw

00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:51.150
that are made in 19th century.

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:55.110
So it depends on the group.

00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:58.170
So when you move into the United
States you can search state

00:40:58.170 --> 00:41:00.480
or you can search by region.

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:06.270
So for example, if you went into
the Southwest you have here a list

00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:10.730
of your groups, like I said because
this is jurisdiction and it's based

00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:17.630
on land we're looking at
where people are located.

00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:24.500 position:56%
We do have groups to try to connect
people, the Sioux group for example,

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:27.060
you know, has several
different reservations,

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:32.080
there's many jurisdictions and
they have each a government,

00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:35.670
so we try to represent
where people physically are.

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:40.800
But we do try to make cultural
connections between related groups.

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:46.660
This is one example of a
constitution out of 1936,

00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:50.140
I was interested in having a
table to show that but I was told

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:54.850
that this was not printed on
very good paper in the 1930's,

00:41:54.850 --> 00:41:57.050
it's not in really great shape.

00:41:57.050 --> 00:41:59.050
And it's actually much
better to look

00:41:59.050 --> 00:42:02.770
at the digital form
than the physical form.

00:42:02.770 --> 00:42:09.290
And this is what you were referring
to about imposed governments

00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:11.140
that this is what we have.

00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:14.210 position:56%
If we get more, find more, see more,

00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:16.720
people want to share
more we would really

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:19.390
like to be able to include that.

00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:22.570
So just a little bit about impact,
I talked about the name authorities

00:42:22.570 --> 00:42:24.710
that we're creating to make sure

00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:29.410
that we have indigenous
people on the map.

00:42:29.410 --> 00:42:33.270 position:56%
Digitized works from the law
Library of Congress and we got a lot

00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:36.490
of people coming to see
us, so you can page visits,

00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:38.510
over 3,000 document downloads.

00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:41.950
People are downloading these
digitized constitutions,

00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:46.810
It's really interesting to see
you know, people are looking

00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:49.690
for these documents,
they're looking for access.

00:42:49.690 --> 00:42:52.590
And it's one thing to read it
because we have it digitized,

00:42:52.590 --> 00:42:55.960
you can look at the website any
time you want but downloading it

00:42:55.960 --> 00:43:00.950
to me means you actually want
to read it, you want to hold it.

00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:03.410
And to me the most interesting
thing is that we've had users

00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:07.240
from 174 countries visit
the indigenous law portal.

00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:10.410
The United Nations
is 193 member states

00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:13.270
so there are people
everywhere who want

00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:16.990
to see what they can
find on indigenous law.

00:43:16.990 --> 00:43:21.420
So like I said it's open,
we would love to have more,

00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:24.890
we're working on Central
America, that's all for me.

00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:26.790
And I thought there was a
schedule here I'm not sure

00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:29.710
who the next person is.

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:32.510
Okay, great thanks.

00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:37.510
[ Applause ]

00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:52.300
[ Background noise ]

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:54.340
&gt;&gt; Barbara Natanson: Good
morning, I'm Barbara Natanson,

00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:56.350
I'm the head of the Print
and photographs reading room

00:43:56.350 --> 00:43:58.090
and with my colleague
Katherine Blood

00:43:58.090 --> 00:44:01.790 position:56%
who is our fine prints curator,
we're excited to have an opportunity

00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:03.870
to talk to you about
our collections.

00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:09.360
Our plan today is to talk to you
about the pictorial collections

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:13.800
in the library if pictorial voices
isn't a contradiction in terms.

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:17.680
Katherine is going to highlight for
you the variety of pictorial voices

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:20.840
that you can see in the prints
and photographs division.

00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:24.120
And then I'll talk to you a little
bit about how to do some searching

00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:26.120
and how to use our collections.

00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:30.770
But first I thought we would
start with a little bit of context

00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:34.590
about the larger collectivity
of materials

00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:36.650
that our Native American
holdings live in.

00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:40.410
So the prints and photograph
division we estimate at this point,

00:44:40.410 --> 00:44:43.280
so everybody comes up and starts to
talk about their millions of items

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:46.180
but we have nearly 16 million
items in the collections.

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:49.870
We're particularly strong for
American culture and history

00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:51.920
but as you can see
from the Japanese print

00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:56.040
in the corner we also have
an international collecting.

00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:59.160
We've gotten our materials
from various sources,

00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:03.060
we've been in existence for a
little bit more than a century.

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:07.680 position:56%
Since 1870 when the copywrite
office found its home in the Library

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:10.560 position:56%
of Congress a lot of our
collections between about that point

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:13.760
and 1920 we're built
through copywrite deposits.

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:15.780
Can you hear me?

00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:19.450
So that meant that people
were submitting their images

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:23.260
to be protected, to register
their rights to the images

00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:24.950
so that other people
would not pirate them

00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:28.500
because even back before
Photoshop pirating was a problem.

00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:31.180
And so it puts a certain
commercial slant on the collections

00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:35.230 position:56%
that we have but we have also gotten
materials through generous gifts

00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:39.150
and we occasionally
purchase materials.

00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:42.540
The largest portion of the
collection is photographs

00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:45.440
and we have photographs in
a lot of different formats

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:50.120
so 19th century photographs
like this cased photograph

00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:53.400
of an African-American
family during the Civil War.

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:56.720
We also have a wonderful collection
of panoramic photographs which came

00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:59.260
to us through copywrite
deposit and these are wonderful

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:02.870
for getting a sense of
landscapes all over the U.S.

00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:06.640
and sometimes towns and cities
and sometimes large groups

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:09.590
because if you are thinking
about marketing your photographs

00:46:09.590 --> 00:46:11.440
and you take a picture
with a large group.

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:15.120
How many can you sell, one to
each person on the group right.

00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:20.580
And then we also have a
larger stereograph collection,

00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:25.010
also acquired through copywrite
deposit primarily so these images

00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:27.750
where you've got two
pictures mounted side by side.

00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:30.530
When you look through them through
a special viewer you get a 3-D

00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:32.850
experience it's sort
you are there experience

00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:37.200
so they can be really
interesting to look at.

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:40.770
Our photo collections are
particularly documentary in nature

00:46:40.770 --> 00:46:44.110
and especially one
concentration is photojournalism

00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:49.790
so you're seeing some
samples on the your left, yes,

00:46:49.790 --> 00:46:54.010 position:56%
sample from an early photojournalism
collection from the 1910's.

00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:56.750
that was based in New York

00:46:56.750 --> 00:46:58.790
but we are also collecting
photojournalism

00:46:58.790 --> 00:47:00.090
up to the present day.

00:47:00.090 --> 00:47:04.660
So we have some collections that
run into the 1980's and 90's.

00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:09.630
We also have lots of images in
nonphotographic formats so just

00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:12.230
as you're seeing materials from
all different formats from all

00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:15.880
over the library, the
kinds of pictorial formats

00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:18.020
that we have are just as
different one from another.

00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:20.130
So we have large poster collection,

00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:23.090
we have comic strips
and cartoon drawings.

00:47:23.090 --> 00:47:26.800
We have sheet music covers and
of course we have fine print

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:28.540
which makes it an appropriate
time for me

00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:32.510
to turn this over to
Katherine Blood.

00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:37.350
[ Applause ]

00:47:37.350 --> 00:47:40.200
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: So we're
going to, is this okay --

00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:44.410
we're going to join Jay in
plugging our Many Nations book

00:47:44.410 --> 00:47:48.920
and it's worth mentioning
that this is a book from 1996

00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:51.860
and the Library has been actively
collecting all along the way.

00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:55.660
So it's a good launch point
to keep going further.

00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:58.580
And the images that we're
bringing which are both appearing

00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:01.470
in this book at John Grable's,

00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:06.200 position:56%
1891 view of a Sioux camp photograph
not long after the massacre

00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:08.530
at Wounded Knee and
then in the middle

00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:12.170
from our protest poster
collection is a 1974 poster,

00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:15.950
We Remember Wounded
Knee by Bruce Carter.

00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:19.220
There's also an online
collection overview, you see a link

00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:23.290
at the top here called images
of Indians of North America

00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:26.240
and there's a collection
[inaudible] on the same subject

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:28.270
which we have brought with
us today and you can find

00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:31.370
in our reading room any time.

00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:36.790 position:56%
So of the libraries more than 17,000
images of Native American peoples

00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:39.540
and related subjects
the lion share arrived

00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:42.900
through copywrite deposit
beginning in the 1870's.

00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:47.150
And of those only a fraction
were made by indigenous creators

00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:48.890
and so acquisition efforts

00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:52.350
in the last several decade
especially have emphasized adding

00:48:52.350 --> 00:48:54.560
works in the first person.

00:48:54.560 --> 00:49:01.160
So first person visual voices by
artists of American Indian heritage

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:03.290
and we'll look at some
example's shortly.

00:49:03.290 --> 00:49:05.490
But in the historic
collection strengths tend

00:49:05.490 --> 00:49:09.420
to cluster along these categories
that you see on the slide.

00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:14.500
And I won't read them, the book
also echos this arrangement

00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:16.850
but I'll mention the images
that are on the screen.

00:49:16.850 --> 00:49:20.400
There is a 1904 portrait of
Navajo women by Edward Curtis

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:23.540
in a fairly rare example
of a subject smiling.

00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:28.800
In his body of work in 1899,
Buffalo Bill Wild West show poster

00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:31.720
which shows that these categories
are not mutually exclusive

00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:33.380
and can overlap.

00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:36.390
A 1903 Francis Benjamin
Johnston photograph

00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:40.030
at Pennsylvania's Carlyle
Indian School.

00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:47.430
A group portrait of a Sioux Indian
delegation to Washington in 1891

00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:49.960
and McKinney and Hall's
1843 portrait

00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:52.630
of Cherokee Chief John Ross.

00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:55.730
In the arena of documentary
photography and we brought one

00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:58.560
of these with us today in the
original over in the corner,

00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:02.220
I hope you get a chance to look
at it up close and in person.

00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:06.450 position:56%
Are this early 20th century
portrait of Blackfoot tribal leader,

00:50:06.450 --> 00:50:10.940 position:56%
Mountain Chief and he's listening to
a recording of a Blackfoot song made

00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:14.330
with ethnographer Francis
Densmore whose scrapbook is

00:50:14.330 --> 00:50:16.380
in the room as well.

00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:20.870
On the right is Zig Jackson's
1995 photo of Vietnam vets,

00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:25.290
Howard and Leroy Crow Flies High
escorting three war mothers.

00:50:25.290 --> 00:50:28.670
And this is part of his
tribal veteran series.

00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:32.080
Now here are photographs by
Richard Throssel who was born

00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:35.840
to a Red River Metis family
in Oregon and later adopted,

00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:39.700
he was adopted into the Crow
nation while working in Montana

00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:42.300
as an Indian service clerk.

00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:45.020
And his work is often compared
with that of Edward Curtis

00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:49.470
and the two met around 1905
and spent time together.

00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:52.290
And here are a few examples from
the libraries extensive Curtis

00:50:52.290 --> 00:50:56.550
collection of about 2,400
photos including an oasis

00:50:56.550 --> 00:50:58.820
in the badlands whose
subject is identified

00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:02.560 position:56%
as an Oglala warrior named Red Hawk.

00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:08.110
In his project called the critical
indigenous photographic exchange,

00:51:08.110 --> 00:51:12.490 position:56%
[inaudible] photographer Will Wilson
consciously embraces the documentary

00:51:12.490 --> 00:51:16.620
impulse of Curtis but supplants
it from the view point of him

00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:17.990
in his own words, I have a quote,

00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:21.560
from whom a 21th century
indigenous trans customary

00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:23.510
cultural practitioner.

00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:27.670 position:56%
And there he is at the left with his
camera and Wilson further evokes,

00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:30.190
they're very beautiful, we have
one on the table over there,

00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:31.930
the self-portrait is over there.

00:51:31.930 --> 00:51:34.180
Wilson further evokes
critics through his use

00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:37.500
of historic photo processes and
his studio portrait approach

00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:41.380
to his subject walking
with directly at the lens.

00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:46.090 position:56%
So he's invited the participation of
indigenous artists, tribal citizens,

00:51:46.090 --> 00:51:50.410
leaders, creators,
curators, academic.

00:51:50.410 --> 00:51:54.990 position:56%
And on the right is Sandra Lamouche,
he's a renowned hoop dancer

00:51:54.990 --> 00:51:59.990 position:56%
and also a scholar and she's a
member of the Big Stone Cree Nation.

00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:05.100
So here on the left is another
famous Curtis image showing

00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:08.650
[inaudible] horse riders
at Canyon de Cheffy.

00:52:08.650 --> 00:52:12.610
And on the right the image is
recast by Alaska born artist,

00:52:12.610 --> 00:52:16.500
Larry McNeil who is a member of
the Tlingit and Nisga'a nations,

00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:20.360
the title is diacritical
form line [inaudible] style.

00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:24.120
We know that Curtis edited things
like alarm clocks and umbrellas

00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:29.580
out of some of his images but
here McNeil playfully adds a group

00:52:29.580 --> 00:52:32.580
of people in an automobile
that suits the period.

00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:35.650
And I have a quote
from McNeil he says,

00:52:35.650 --> 00:52:38.730
I have fun with the American
mythology and in the spirit

00:52:38.730 --> 00:52:43.890
of Raven our own northwest
coast mythological being,

00:52:43.890 --> 00:52:45.190
change things around.

00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:47.970
I have an indigenous
family out for a cruise,

00:52:47.970 --> 00:52:49.860
instead of the romanticized idea

00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:52.540
of noble savages riding
their horses everywhere.

00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:55.380
And if you look closely
you can see him

00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:58.440
in the lower left blue
margin is the photographer

00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:00.840
with his camera strapped
around his neck.

00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:06.040
So he's there, he's sort of
inside but also outside the action

00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:08.120
as witness and commentator.

00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:12.910
And here's one of the earliest
known European portrait prints

00:53:12.910 --> 00:53:15.270
of an American Indian from life,

00:53:15.270 --> 00:53:19.250
from 1645 by bohemian
artist, Wanaslause Hollar.

00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:21.830
It's tiny it's about this big.

00:53:21.830 --> 00:53:25.580
And the title identifies him
as an American form Virginia

00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:30.500 position:56%
and a recent scholar has tentatively
identified the man a Muncy,

00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:33.470
Delaware, Algonquin
speaking lawyer called Jack

00:53:33.470 --> 00:53:35.330
and almost nothing else is known.

00:53:35.330 --> 00:53:40.370 position:56%
Oh, who was transported to
Amsterdam from New Amsterdam in 1644

00:53:40.370 --> 00:53:42.820
and almost nothing else is known.

00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:45.880 position:56%
On the right is a recent
acquisition which we've also brought

00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:50.500
with us today, a 2011
monoprint by Osage artist,

00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:54.480
Norman Akars who was born and
raised in Oklahoma and teaches

00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:56.800
at the university of Kansas.

00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:58.980
So underscoring images of migration

00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:01.790
and immigration you
see birds in flight.

00:54:01.790 --> 00:54:05.090
And bank note portraits of three
well-known U.S. founding fathers

00:54:05.090 --> 00:54:08.250
arriving in alien spaceships.

00:54:08.250 --> 00:54:11.920 position:56%
They are alexander Hamilton, Ulysses
S. Grant and George Washington

00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:14.720
and they're all associated
with government policies

00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:18.830
that would have devastating
results for indigenous Americans.

00:54:18.830 --> 00:54:21.440
The conventionalized image, I
interviewed him a little bit

00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:26.070
and asked about the very red
Indian that appears on the left

00:54:26.070 --> 00:54:29.560
and he was barred from an old
Webster's dictionary for the entry

00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:32.340
that went along with
the word tom-tom.

00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:39.000
So it's playful but it has a punch.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.800
So these beautiful,
vibrant screen prints are

00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:47.110
by Oklahoma Potawatomie artist,
dancer and musician, Woody Crumbo.

00:54:47.110 --> 00:54:50.300
While studying art at Wichita
University and the University

00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:54.460 position:56%
of Oklahoma, Crumbo supported
himself as a dancer while performing

00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:57.040
in collective tribal dances
from across the country.

00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:59.240
And these came in through
copywrite deposit.

00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:04.470
Jaune Quick-To-See Smith is a
member of the confederated Salish

00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:09.160
and Kootenai nation of Montana and
her 2014 lithograph called Waiting

00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:12.010
for Rain, shows a central
figure based

00:55:12.010 --> 00:55:15.450
on the right hand 19th century
portrait of a Mandan man

00:55:15.450 --> 00:55:19.230
by Swiss artist, Karl Bodmer and
we have an impression of this

00:55:19.230 --> 00:55:23.980
in rare book division has a hand
colored impression of this as well.

00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:28.410
So surrounding him in Juane
Quick-To-See Smith's images are

00:55:28.410 --> 00:55:32.310
signs of the natural world
and you can't see it very well

00:55:32.310 --> 00:55:36.840
but tiny song lyrics that are form
the song, You Are My sunshine,

00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:39.950
you make me happy when
skies are gray.

00:55:39.950 --> 00:55:45.230
And on the left margin
she says listen up humans.

00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:47.960
So she's saying something very
different with the imagery

00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:51.200
and she made the work,
she's a gardener.

00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:55.260 position:56%
She made the work during a period
of severe drought, about five years,

00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:58.210
so she's commenting on
environmental health

00:55:58.210 --> 00:56:01.420
and the fragility of the ecosystem.

00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:04.680
So before turning things back
over to Barbara I just want

00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:06.850
to give an idea, we've
been looking at sort

00:56:06.850 --> 00:56:12.270
of narrative story telling
representational images

00:56:12.270 --> 00:56:16.320
but our collection traverse
a much wider universe

00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:17.790
of styles and subjects.

00:56:17.790 --> 00:56:22.450 position:56%
So going clockwise from top left,
some beautiful contemporary examples

00:56:22.450 --> 00:56:28.250 position:56%
by Kay WalkingStick, Wendy Red Star,
Edgar Heap-of- Birds and Marie Watt.

00:56:28.250 --> 00:56:31.310
And this is just the tiniest
tip of the iceberg so we hope

00:56:31.310 --> 00:56:33.890
to see you come and
look and explore further

00:56:33.890 --> 00:56:36.510
and now we'll hear from Barbara.

00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:42.630
[ Applause ]

00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:45.470
&gt;&gt; Barbara Natanson:
So how do you delve

00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:47.930
into the iceberg, that's
the big question.

00:56:47.930 --> 00:56:50.260
Well, you've probably already
discovered that there's a lot

00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:53.760
of search systems on the
Library of Congress website

00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:57.490
and we have a catalogue
that's devoted to the holdings

00:56:57.490 --> 00:56:59.630
of the prints and photographs
division, it's called the prints

00:56:59.630 --> 00:57:02.230
and photographs online catalogue.

00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:06.700
You'll see the URL at the top of
this screen, we also have a handout

00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:11.640
at the back of the room, so before
you leave today do take a handout

00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:14.230
then you can pursue the
mystery of which are the tips

00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:15.890
that I'm not telling
you out loud today

00:57:15.890 --> 00:57:18.080
that you could pursue
through the paper.

00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:21.270
At any rate the prints and
photographs online catalogue,

00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:25.340
we estimate it covers about 95%
of our holdings at some level

00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:27.290
and some level is the asterisk.

00:57:27.290 --> 00:57:30.500
We describe somethings as entire
groups maybe because they're going

00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:32.220
to be better understood
as groups and also

00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:36.380 position:56%
because describing 16 million items
one by one could take a lot of time.

00:57:36.380 --> 00:57:39.160
We also have some items that
are individually described.

00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:43.070
Often things like the fine prints
that Katherine was showing you.

00:57:43.070 --> 00:57:48.160
Of the 16 million items
we've digitized about 1

00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:51.750 position:56%
and a quarter million images, so you
will find lots of digitized images

00:57:51.750 --> 00:57:54.740
to the online catalogue
but not by any means all.

00:57:54.740 --> 00:57:59.250
In terms of using the online
catalogue you would have a slightly

00:57:59.250 --> 00:58:02.200
different experience if you're
here on site at the library

00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:05.270
versus if you're searching
from home or your office

00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:11.170 position:56%
or from the classrooms that you
might be using this couple of weeks.

00:58:11.170 --> 00:58:13.970
So when you're onsite
here at the Library

00:58:13.970 --> 00:58:16.830
of Congress we usually
offer a small thumbnail

00:58:16.830 --> 00:58:21.700
but we also offer a larger JPEG or
2 and a high resolution TIF file.

00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:24.220
When you're outside the Library
of Congress if you don't know

00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:25.600
that the rights are free

00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:29.610
for an image we only
display the thumbnail image,

00:58:29.610 --> 00:58:32.530
so to have the fullest
experience you'd want

00:58:32.530 --> 00:58:34.820
to be doing your searching online.

00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:39.090
But we've also tried to make it
as efficient as possible for you

00:58:39.090 --> 00:58:42.860
to do your searching where
it makes the most sense.

00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:46.310
So whenever you do a search for
instance I did a search for Indians

00:58:46.310 --> 00:58:52.250
of North America, I got 4,531
records that I used that phrase.

00:58:52.250 --> 00:58:55.900
But you can see at the top that I
could filter my results so if I'm

00:58:55.900 --> 00:59:00.800
at home or I'm outside the
libraries buildings I might filter

00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:03.010
to larger image available anywhere

00:59:03.010 --> 00:59:05.310
because those are the digitized
images that I'd be able

00:59:05.310 --> 00:59:08.950
to see the larger JPEG and TIF and
see all the detail that they offer

00:59:08.950 --> 00:59:10.250
as well as download them.

00:59:10.250 --> 00:59:14.840
In the middle you see larger image
available only at the Library

00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:16.280
of Congress, those are the ones

00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:18.780
that if you're planning a visit
here you may want to focus

00:59:18.780 --> 00:59:20.170
on those while you're here.

00:59:20.170 --> 00:59:23.300
Onsite so that you can make
most efficient use of your time.

00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:26.630
And likewise you see that there
are 259 listing for things

00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:28.040
that are not digitized at all.

00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:35.050
So again you might want to focus
on those while you're here on site.

00:59:35.050 --> 00:59:38.320
You are very welcome to come to
our reading room to do research,

00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:42.280
we're in the Madison building
across this street in room 337

00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:44.100
so up on the third floor.

00:59:44.100 --> 00:59:47.440
We're open Monday through
Friday, 8:30 to 5:00.

00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:50.360
We stop bringing things out
of the storage areas at 4 PM

00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:53.590
so it's usually a good idea
well before that point.

00:59:53.590 --> 00:59:56.420
But as you can see in this
picture that we also have a lot

00:59:56.420 --> 00:59:58.770
of file cabinets in our reading
room, so even if you were

00:59:58.770 --> 01:00:00.970
to get here close to 4
there may be some material

01:00:00.970 --> 01:00:02.930
that we can show you right
out in the reading room.

01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:07.000
We have lockers right in our
foyer so you don't need to worry

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.850
about locking up your
belongings in the cloak room.

01:00:09.850 --> 01:00:12.390
Just bring them with you and we'll
help you get them stowed away

01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:14.560
and then you'll have easy
access to them while you're

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:18.820
in our reading room where we allow
very few things in general just

01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:20.340
to protect that materials.

01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:23.850
So things to remember to bring
if you come to make a visit,

01:00:23.850 --> 01:00:27.300
bring your LC reader card, we'll
do a little registration activity

01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:30.190
up at our front desk
and do some orientation.

01:00:30.190 --> 01:00:32.330
It's a good idea also
to bring a camera,

01:00:32.330 --> 01:00:36.150 position:56%
many of our pictures are too old or
fragile to go on a photocopy machine

01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:39.890
so the best way to take a record
of what you saw is to take a point

01:00:39.890 --> 01:00:43.410
and shoot photo without flash.

01:00:43.410 --> 01:00:46.720
Because you may want to download
images that are not displaying

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:48.020
for you outside the Library

01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:50.780
of Congress buildings it's also a
good idea to bring a flash drive

01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:53.580
or a lap top onto which
you can down the images.

01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:55.630
And then of course your curiosity,

01:00:55.630 --> 01:01:00.200
it's always a good thing
to come armed with.

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:03.310
So for the most part you don't
need to make an advance appointment

01:01:03.310 --> 01:01:07.000
to use our collections, many things
are available just on demand,

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.580
often if it's something in our
storage areas we help you fill

01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:12.620
out a paper call slip, we go an
fetch it and it's available to you

01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:14.820
within about 10 to 15 minutes.

01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:18.480
There are some occasions however
where a material is either offsite

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:20.780 position:56%
and we need time to bring it onsite.

01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:23.730
Or it's so fragile that we need
to have a staff member available

01:01:23.730 --> 01:01:25.530
to work with you one on one.

01:01:25.530 --> 01:01:28.530
So one thing to watch out
for is an access advisory

01:01:28.530 --> 01:01:31.200
because that's a situation in which
it would be a good idea to get

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:32.650
in touch with us in advance just

01:01:32.650 --> 01:01:36.770
so that we can make sure we
have the material available

01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:39.420
for you to look at.

01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:43.900
And by means of contacting
us whether or not you need

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:46.960
to make an appointment or you just
want to know what we might have,

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:49.050
we're really happy
to consult with you.

01:01:49.050 --> 01:01:52.420
We do answer our phone
between 8:30 and 5.

01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:57.200
So if you phone us just press 3
when you get to the phone tree

01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:00.650
and a reference person will
pick up to talk with you.

01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:03.650
We also do Ask a Librarian,
as Jay was mentioning.

01:02:03.650 --> 01:02:07.320 position:56%
So when you're within the prints and
photographs online catalogue the way

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:11.000 position:56%
to find our Ask a Librarian page
most directly is to look to the left

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.850
where it says ask a prints
and photographs librarian.

01:02:13.850 --> 01:02:15.690
That way you don't have
to be steered to us

01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:17.690
through all the other librarians

01:02:17.690 --> 01:02:20.680
who are monitoring Ask a
Librarian here at the library.

01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:24.590
And when you select that you will
get to our Ask a Librarian page.

01:02:24.590 --> 01:02:27.950
Where you can either go ahead
and fill out the online form

01:02:27.950 --> 01:02:30.930
to ask us your question
or go ahead and phone us.

01:02:30.930 --> 01:02:32.700
If it's not something
that we can answer

01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:36.140
in real time then we'll always
direct you to Ask a Librarian page

01:02:36.140 --> 01:02:38.670
and you know, tell you the things
that would be most important for us

01:02:38.670 --> 01:02:41.320
to know so that we can
research your question further.

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:44.510
With that.

01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:50.140
[ Applause ]

01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:52.360 position:56%
We'll hope that you can make a visit

01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:55.510
and I think we're turning
it over to Judith Gray.

01:02:55.510 --> 01:03:01.100
[ Background noise ]

01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:04.740 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Judith Gray: I join with
everybody in saying welcome to those

01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:07.290
of you who have never been
here before and I'm pleased

01:03:07.290 --> 01:03:09.500
to see some people whom
I have met here before.

01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:11.980
So, welcome back.

01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:16.420 position:56%
We've mentioned Edward Curtis
multiple times here so I just wanted

01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:20.500
to say for those who are interested
he also made sound recordings

01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:23.090
but they are one of the
things that are not here.

01:03:23.090 --> 01:03:25.510
The Edward Curtis recordings
are at the Archives

01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:28.680
of Traditional Music
at Indiana University.

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:33.080
So if anybody is looking for
that part of the picture,

01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:38.790
or hear the sound of that picture,
you'll need to go to Indiana.

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:44.680
So I want to tell you just a
little bit about our holdings,

01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:51.320 position:56%
the archive of the American Folk
Life Center has probably the largest

01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:55.490
collection of one of a kind
ethnographic recordings

01:03:55.490 --> 01:03:58.520
of tribal music, somewhere
in the order of --

01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:01.710
and I'm saying music
and I'll explain why.

01:04:01.710 --> 01:04:09.060
Probably over 2,000 hours at least
from at least 140 different tribes

01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:10.940 position:56%
and many more communities than that.

01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:15.020
Since a lot of collections were
recorded in multiple locations.

01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:19.640
So there's a lot of material here
but it is certainly not uniform

01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:24.790
in terms of where it comes from,
nor is it uniform in the kinds

01:04:24.790 --> 01:04:28.370
of material, the kinds of sound
recordings that you'll find here.

01:04:28.370 --> 01:04:32.050 position:56%
None the less I think quite a few
of you will find your way back to us

01:04:32.050 --> 01:04:37.510
in the course of the next
week, I look forward to that.

01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:41.630
The recordings that came to
us come from various places,

01:04:41.630 --> 01:04:43.850
we did end up with
most of the bureau

01:04:43.850 --> 01:04:47.170
of American ethnology
cylinder recordings,

01:04:47.170 --> 01:04:51.040
in particular our recordings
go back to 1890.

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:53.030
You heard Betsy Peterson
make mention

01:04:53.030 --> 01:04:57.350 position:56%
of those Passamaquoddy recordings
when she started the morning for us.

01:04:57.350 --> 01:05:00.820
But we have recordings all the
way up to at least last year

01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:03.630
when we had performers here.

01:05:03.630 --> 01:05:08.420
And when people performed here
we also try to interview them

01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:11.220
about their cultural
heritage and such

01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:14.350
and so we have those
materials become part

01:05:14.350 --> 01:05:17.400
of the collections as well.

01:05:20.410 --> 01:05:24.020
The people who are out doing
the early recordings though were

01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:30.180 position:56%
principally linguists, ethnologists,
early ethnomusicologist, folklorists

01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:34.890
and occasional tourists and such.

01:05:34.890 --> 01:05:39.630
You're very lucky I thought when
the sound came that it was going

01:05:39.630 --> 01:05:42.520
to be the evacuation
of this building,

01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:45.910
we haven't had our
spring fire drill yet.

01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:50.220
Oh, let it go.

01:05:51.850 --> 01:05:54.160
Anyway be prepared.

01:05:55.270 --> 01:06:01.510
So the people who are out making
those early recordings almost all

01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:06.300
of them were prepared to deal with
international phonetic alphabet.

01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:10.050
So narratives, spoken word,
almost exclusively taken

01:06:10.050 --> 01:06:12.480
down by hand, by dictation.

01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:17.690
And you'll have to be at
whatever location has those

01:06:17.690 --> 01:06:19.270
written manuscripts.

01:06:19.270 --> 01:06:22.190
In a lot of cases for the
ones collected for the Bureau

01:06:22.190 --> 01:06:25.870
of American Ethnology you're
going to be looking at documents

01:06:25.870 --> 01:06:28.330
at the National Anthropological
Archives.

01:06:28.330 --> 01:06:33.860
I think you have gone there
or you're going there, right.

01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:39.560
Mostly then the early
sound recordings tend

01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:41.850
to be the wax cylinders
that were recorded

01:06:41.850 --> 01:06:45.540
between roughly 1890 and 1930.

01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:49.490
Most of the early ones only would
take about two minutes of material,

01:06:49.490 --> 01:06:52.480
sometimes they could
stretch them by playing very,

01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:55.810
very slowly they could get a
little bit more material on.

01:06:55.810 --> 01:07:00.100
But you're still only looking
at small amounts of audio.

01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:03.220
And so for that reason,
that was part of the reason

01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:07.830
that the narrative, the much
longer narratives were taken

01:07:07.830 --> 01:07:12.910
down by dictation and the cylinders
themselves were reserved for songs.

01:07:12.910 --> 01:07:16.700
So the bulk of the audio
recordings that you're going

01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:20.600
to get here are going to be
songs rather than spoken word

01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:24.830
and that means when you're
trying to extract words

01:07:24.830 --> 01:07:27.810
and such you're dealing
with a lot of repertoire

01:07:27.810 --> 01:07:31.650
that might be mostly vocables and
you're going to deal with the fact

01:07:31.650 --> 01:07:35.270
that you know, when you sing a word
you might pronounce it slightly

01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:37.300
differently than when you speak it.

01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:41.910
You might you know, accent it
slightly differently depending upon

01:07:41.910 --> 01:07:47.570
the melody, so you're going to have
to be working through those things

01:07:47.570 --> 01:07:50.460
and keep those factors in mind.

01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:56.660 position:56%
Another thing about the collections,
you're always dependent then

01:07:56.660 --> 01:08:01.240
on what the goal was of the person
who was out making the recordings.

01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:06.940
And while some of them were focused
on more general materials one

01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:10.950
of the major collectors, for
example Francis Densmore.

01:08:10.950 --> 01:08:15.290
Her goal was specifically to get
the oldest ceremonial traditions

01:08:15.290 --> 01:08:16.830
that she could.

01:08:16.830 --> 01:08:22.080
So that meant she did not go women,
she did not collect work songs,

01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:25.000
she did not collect lullaby's,

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:30.280
she would be wherever she could
approaching the oldest men usually

01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:32.470
who were the ceremonial leaders.

01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:38.580 position:56%
And so you end up getting recordings
of only certain kinds of genres,

01:08:38.580 --> 01:08:42.320
in the case of, if she was
recording really old men

01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:46.440
in some communities
their voices quavered

01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:52.320
so the question then becomes is
the quaver simply and older voice

01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:58.420 position:56%
or is it part of the stylistic
trait of that particular song genre.

01:08:58.420 --> 01:09:02.150
Again something that
those of you who are

01:09:02.150 --> 01:09:05.640
in the communities hopefully will
recognize and be able to sort

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:09.690
out that which is relevant
to what you are doing.

01:09:09.690 --> 01:09:14.800 position:56%
&gt;&gt; How did she come to the
conclusion that old men [inaudible].

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:17.470
&gt;&gt; Judith Gray: Well, that's
what she was finding is she went

01:09:17.470 --> 01:09:19.900
out you know, as she started

01:09:19.900 --> 01:09:24.140
and started her collecting she
was constantly being directed

01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:26.140
to the older men.

01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:29.950
And then I think after a while
that became more her focus

01:09:29.950 --> 01:09:33.460
so that she didn't -- she
wasn't questioning that,

01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:36.910
she was following that
particular trend.

01:09:36.910 --> 01:09:40.550
She started her collecting
career when she was 40 years old

01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:45.420
and kept collecting
until she was 87.

01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:51.570
So, her story is another one, well,
all of these collections are filled

01:09:51.570 --> 01:09:57.530
with stories and sometimes the
stories are all in one place

01:09:57.530 --> 01:10:00.290
that you can find but
in a lot of cases

01:10:00.290 --> 01:10:04.490
for example the recordings
came here, the documentation

01:10:04.490 --> 01:10:10.950 position:56%
that may have been created at the
same time is in another institution.

01:10:10.950 --> 01:10:15.810
Correspondence that the collector
had either with people who sang

01:10:15.810 --> 01:10:20.450
for him or with the sponsoring
organization that may be

01:10:20.450 --> 01:10:22.600
in a third place entirely.

01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:26.850
We've tried to gather what we can
so that we're trying to provide you

01:10:26.850 --> 01:10:30.490
as full a picture as we
can of what's out there,

01:10:30.490 --> 01:10:34.890
so it doesn't mean we've got all
the photo copies from other places

01:10:34.890 --> 01:10:37.360
and we may not have picked up
absolutely everything there

01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:41.750
so if you were really pursuing one
specific collection you may find

01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:45.100
yourself going to multiple
institutions and multiple states

01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:48.120
or even multiple countries
in some cases.

01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:52.020
The other part to say
is that because

01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:56.850
of this way collecting was done,
especially early on, you know,

01:10:56.850 --> 01:11:02.150 position:56%
the focus was really on the parts of
the country, the parts of the U.S.

01:11:02.150 --> 01:11:07.100
where it was believed that
native cultures were more intact.

01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:10.690
So you end up getting far more
interest and far more recordings

01:11:10.690 --> 01:11:14.560
from the American southwest,
east of the Mississippi,

01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:16.770
you're pretty much
going to get Iroquois,

01:11:16.770 --> 01:11:19.710
you might get a few things
around the Great Lakes.

01:11:19.710 --> 01:11:24.270
You're going to get a few Cherokee
recordings from North Carolina

01:11:24.270 --> 01:11:26.400
and a few Seminole
recordings from Florida.

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:29.500
You're not going to get much else.

01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:34.780
So there's you know, in some cases
we have collections that are less,

01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:38.430
about two minutes of material,
on the other hand we've got

01:11:38.430 --> 01:11:42.910
at least one Pueblo collections
that's over 400 hours.

01:11:42.910 --> 01:11:48.950
So it's for that reason I do
want to tell you for the groups

01:11:48.950 --> 01:11:51.910
that I represented in this
year's Breath of Life.

01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:56.770
I can tell you which groups have
some material here because some

01:11:56.770 --> 01:11:59.860
of you will not be
seeing us I expect.

01:11:59.860 --> 01:12:07.600
We do have the Chumash recordings
so that will be for those

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:12.820
of you doing some of
the [inaudible] work,

01:12:12.820 --> 01:12:20.100
we do have some Haida materials,
some Hupa materials, Miwok,

01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:24.600
for Nisenan the closest that we
have are two KonKow collections.

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:28.500
So if that turns out to be relevant

01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:31.320
that would be the material
we would have.

01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:36.880
We do have quite a bit
of Nez Perce, some Oto,

01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:40.190
Piute although this is one instance

01:12:40.190 --> 01:12:43.450
where the collectors don't
necessarily tell you exactly

01:12:43.450 --> 01:12:45.380
which Piute group.

01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:48.710
So you're going to have to look
and see what the documentation says

01:12:48.710 --> 01:12:50.740
and see if you can determine
whether it's relevant

01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:53.950
to your specific community or not.

01:12:53.950 --> 01:13:00.840 position:56%
Likewise Pomo, oh yes, that's a real
mix in what we have listed here.

01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:07.180
Ponca and Ponca is the
last of the groups.

01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:11.330
Okay, one of the things to be
said since many of you are groups

01:13:11.330 --> 01:13:18.140
from California, a lot of what
we have is samples that are drawn

01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:24.680
from elsewhere and so especially
from the Hearst Museum at Berkeley.

01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:28.980
What we end up, for example
the Pomo recordings are most

01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:32.880
of them are going to be samplers
of larger collections that are

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:36.050
out there, so you're welcome
to listen to the materials

01:13:36.050 --> 01:13:39.810
that we have here but of course
their collections are larger

01:13:39.810 --> 01:13:42.600
and chances are they've
got much more documentation

01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:44.790
than ever made its way here.

01:13:44.790 --> 01:13:48.300
So when you're deciding
whether or not to come back

01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:52.240
and do some listening with
us, you'll need to weigh that.

01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:59.400
And I would give one set of
these pages to Gabriella to take

01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:01.310
so that you can look
at it ahead of time

01:14:01.310 --> 01:14:07.040
and see whether it's worthwhile
and so for you to come.

01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:10.070
We will need to have you make
listening appointments just

01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:14.250 position:56%
so we can have the materials cued up
for you, it will be streaming audio

01:14:14.250 --> 01:14:18.230
and listening cubes
in the reading room.

01:14:18.230 --> 01:14:21.650
Or sometimes in the conference
room if it's a larger group.

01:14:21.650 --> 01:14:24.640
And then we'll see how best we
can accommodate you and bring

01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:27.640
out whatever materials we
have that are relevant.

01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:32.310
Over on the table over there I
brought out some of the originals,

01:14:32.310 --> 01:14:35.300
some of the field note
from Willard Rhodes,

01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:38.460
some of Ellis Fletcher's the notes

01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:42.910
that were inside the Oto
cylinder boxes and some

01:14:42.910 --> 01:14:47.230
of the Helen Roberts
field notes and such.

01:14:47.230 --> 01:14:50.710
Chances are again as you've
heard from other reading rooms

01:14:50.710 --> 01:14:55.570
if we've got a surrogate
copy we'll use that.

01:14:55.570 --> 01:14:59.210
So that you don't have worry
as much about you know,

01:14:59.210 --> 01:15:02.200
something getting damage
or whatever.

01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:07.550
I do also want to say at the
end of this, one other thing.

01:15:07.550 --> 01:15:10.490
You've heard from several
readings rooms, you haven't heard

01:15:10.490 --> 01:15:14.890
from all the reading rooms here
in the library and the fact is

01:15:14.890 --> 01:15:19.160
that there's going to be
material related to tribal groups

01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:21.840
in probably ever single
reading room.

01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:27.670
And so you can think more broadly,
the library also has the largest,

01:15:27.670 --> 01:15:30.790
well you've seen some maps
but the libraries geography

01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:33.420
and maps division is enormous.

01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:36.270 position:56%
And if you were interested in seeing

01:15:36.270 --> 01:15:41.470
if there are maps documenting
the territory of the community

01:15:41.470 --> 01:15:45.420
that might be a useful
thing for you to do.

01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:49.770
I even noticed one of the things
that Jay showed you about one

01:15:49.770 --> 01:15:53.320
of the searches, the Chumash
searches, one of the titles

01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:56.240
for a bilingual document
was actually

01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:59.000
for something that's
in children's lit.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:03.860
So even there in children's
literature you may find things

01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:09.470
that would have samples of
language that could be relevant.

01:16:09.470 --> 01:16:15.700
So, as all here have said, talk
with all of us who do reference

01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:19.720
and we'll try to get you to
different parts of the library

01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:22.190
that might have useful
things, um, hum.

01:16:22.190 --> 01:16:27.210
&gt;&gt; With regard to the [inaudible]
that are copies of for example

01:16:27.210 --> 01:16:30.920
from the particular
[inaudible] the copies

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:37.450
that are here might be better
quality than ones like back

01:16:37.450 --> 01:16:43.550
in Berkeley that [inaudible]
maybe you have a better copy here.

01:16:43.550 --> 01:16:46.780
&gt;&gt; Judith Gray: That would
be, my guess would be not

01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:49.780
because I think the
samples were sent

01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:54.160
by what was formerly the Lowie
Museum before it became the

01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:55.470
Hearst Museum.

01:16:55.470 --> 01:16:59.140
The Lowie sent samples
probably in the 70's

01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:06.350
to see [inaudible] yeah I
think they sent just samples

01:17:06.350 --> 01:17:10.200
to see what our copies
would then look like.

01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:15.790 position:56%
But the originals went back and then
they made their own copies later

01:17:15.790 --> 01:17:17.090
on at some point.

01:17:17.090 --> 01:17:22.450 position:56%
So my hunch is that for a lot of the
materials it's probably going to be

01:17:22.450 --> 01:17:27.170
that we have actually [inaudible]
lower than the ones they have.

01:17:27.170 --> 01:17:32.600
So then the question becomes
you know, what was the equipment

01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:35.790
that was used for transferring
at which point,

01:17:35.790 --> 01:17:37.840
but that's another, yeah.

01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:43.580
&gt;&gt; I think it was done --
yeah there were two copies

01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:46.720
of the cylinders that
were [inaudible].

01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:48.520
&gt;&gt; Judith Gray: There's all sorts
of interesting stuff happening

01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:53.120
with cylinders but it's all
going to take a lot of time

01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:59.810
at this point it can take several
hours to do a retransfer and then

01:17:59.810 --> 01:18:03.710
to do the processing
before you get one cylinder

01:18:03.710 --> 01:18:05.960
of two or three minutes.

01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:10.580
So it's happening and there's
some exciting possibilities

01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:13.490
but it will be [inaudible].

01:18:13.490 --> 01:18:21.030
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] are you using Irene
here that laser beam [inaudible].

01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:26.430
&gt;&gt; We've done the 3-D Irene you
need a 3-D reader as opposed

01:18:26.430 --> 01:18:29.550
to a 2 dimensional
one that reads disks,

01:18:29.550 --> 01:18:33.390
the 3-D one is working
somewhere I know

01:18:33.390 --> 01:18:38.320
that it's being used actually
I think the Ishii recordings

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:42.240
that Crober [phonetic] made
I think those have been done

01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:45.200
out in California.

01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:49.870
We have a few samples
that we have been using --

01:18:49.870 --> 01:18:53.390
there are at least two
other transfer mechanisms

01:18:53.390 --> 01:18:58.880
that we've been using that
are a little bit faster.

01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:03.530 position:56%
And we'll see, you know, how that
all goes, yeah but we're using Irene

01:19:03.530 --> 01:19:07.030
for something's, we have real
hopes that Irene can restore some

01:19:07.030 --> 01:19:11.200
at least broken cylinders that
are not shattered but broken.

01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:15.830
And we'll see how that all goes.

01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:19.620
So, anyway I think we're
getting to the time when you have

01:19:19.620 --> 01:19:25.780
to be heading back and so,
you're pointing to the what?

01:19:25.780 --> 01:19:30.010
I was looking for you.

01:19:30.010 --> 01:19:38.480 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I first wanted to do two things,
the first is to thank our colleagues

01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:41.510
at the Library of Congress.

01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:45.600
[ Applause ]

01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:50.330
So you heard from Betsy, from Jay,
from two Barbara's, from Carla,

01:19:50.330 --> 01:19:55.200
from Katherine, from Judith,
from Guha, he was gracious enough

01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:59.060
to get us in and out even
with unexpected coffee.

01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:02.490
There was Jen also helping out
and there's a number of people

01:20:02.490 --> 01:20:05.150
who I haven't met but
who are here and I know.

01:20:05.150 --> 01:20:08.590
I don't have their names so
we're talking a dozen people

01:20:08.590 --> 01:20:11.890
who are coming together
and giving us their time

01:20:11.890 --> 01:20:13.900
for the next two weeks.

01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:17.470
And so I wanted to bring that
back to a point that I made

01:20:17.470 --> 01:20:21.940
in my opening remarks on Monday
and that is that that there's many

01:20:21.940 --> 01:20:27.980
of us holding the pieces, building
that bullet proof spider web

01:20:27.980 --> 01:20:32.030
to hold all of these efforts to
sustaining linguistic diversity,

01:20:32.030 --> 01:20:36.090
hold on to the net, you're not
alone, we're altogether here.

01:20:36.090 --> 01:20:40.630
So appointments first and
we'll get the bus thing going

01:20:40.630 --> 01:20:45.510
and thank you again to our
Library of Congress colleagues.

01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:48.190
[ Applause ]

01:20:48.190 --> 01:20:50.750
&gt;&gt; This has been a
presentation of the Library

01:20:50.750 --> 01:20:54.190
of Congress, visit us at loc.gov.
