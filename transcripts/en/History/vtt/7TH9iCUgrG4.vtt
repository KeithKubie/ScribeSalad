00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.380
RCHARD DOLAN: The Flatwoods
monster case, this

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.880
occurred on September 12, 1952.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.620
[thunder]

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.500
This whole thing
happened at dusk,

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.500
and there were a number
of young people going off

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.250
into the woods, and saw some
kind of fiery glowing object

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.580
that descended or came down.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.500
Two of the boys, Ed and
Freddy, grabbed their mother,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.250
whose name is Kathleen May, and
she came back with the group

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.420
to see this thing, what they
described as a creature.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.420
It's very tall.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.920
It's got eyes that are glowing
red, and it scares them.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.920
Project Blue Book
still in the early years.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.920
And it was reported
to the Air Force

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.750
because there was
something in the sky.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.920
RCHARD DOLAN: Investigators who
went there after the sighting

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.880
stated that there was an unusual
smell or odor in that area,

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.920
and it was said that
the trees in the area

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.960
were singed at the top.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.210
There were investigators
who said that branches

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.380
actually were broken.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.920
Now, that's very
interesting that branches

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.420
were broken by something
that evidently came down.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.380
This is one of the instances
in which Project Blue Book

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.460
was genuinely actively
doing serious investigations

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.880
at that time.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.460
I do recall seeing
the May family sketches.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.380
They weren't extremely
detailed, but they were similar.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.290
The family members all
drew the same thing,

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.580
which was interesting.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.380
The official
explanation was that it

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.790
was a combination
of a bright meteor

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.120
and a delusion, a
psychological case.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.620
Most puzzling case, for my
father thought about that a lot

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.170
and really couldn't conclude
anything one way or the other.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.170
