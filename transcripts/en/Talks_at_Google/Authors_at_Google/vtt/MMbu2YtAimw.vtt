[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.387 --> 00:00:08.720
SPEAKER 1: Brian Patrick Eha
is going to get us started.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.450
He is a journalist who's
followed the rise of Bitcoin

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:12.521
from its beginnings.

00:00:12.521 --> 00:00:14.270
His work has appeared
in "The New Yorker",

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.160
in "The Atlantic", "CNN Money",
"Entrepreneur", "Outside",

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.359
and the "LA Review of Books."

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:20.900
He's the author of
the new book, "How

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.940
Money Got Free,
Bitcoin and the Fight

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.260
for the Future of Finance."

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.468
And we'll have copies of
the book available for sales

00:00:26.468 --> 00:00:28.110
and signing after the event.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.625
All right, Brian, do you want to
come up and get things started?

00:00:31.625 --> 00:00:33.066
We can give him a round.

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:36.042
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:44.634 --> 00:00:47.050
BRIAN PATRICK EHA: All right,
thanks for being here, guys.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.850
I'm Brian.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.040
I think I'm going to
keep this fairly short,

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.840
because I know the
real substance of this

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.810
is going to come in the Q&amp;A,
first with Tessa and then

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.240
when I get to hear
whatever questions you

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.830
might have for me.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.260
But I thought it
would be good maybe

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.690
to talk first about how I
got into Bitcoin, writing

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.470
about it as a journalist.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.830
So I first heard
about Bitcoin in 2011,

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.530
but I didn't know anybody
in the space at the time.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.290
I wasn't really thinking
of writing about it

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.530
as a journalistic subject.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.650
Then in the summer of 2012, I
was working as a staff writer

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.390
at "CNN Money", and
some news appeared,

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.780
this little news item
appeared on "Hacker News".

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.670
Something had leaked
out of a Bitcoin startup

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.000
that was based here in the
Flatiron district in New York.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.680
I didn't even know
they were there,

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.170
but it sounded kind
of interesting.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.670
They were trying to
do this debit card

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.790
that you could load with
Bitcoin and then use it

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:46.840
like a normal debit card.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.256
So there'd be a way for you
to spend your digital currency

00:01:49.256 --> 00:01:50.860
in the real world.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.890
I pitched this story to my
editor, and I'll never forget.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.370
When I pitched it, she said,
yeah, OK, go and do it.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.580
But don't make it out
to be more than it is.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.940
Bitcoin is just a play
thing for crypto anarchists.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.030
It's this weird kind of
artifact of internet culture,

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.350
but it's nothing, you know?

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:09.130
It's fairy dust.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:15.007
It's tulips, it's whatever.

00:02:15.007 --> 00:02:16.340
I didn't really see it that way.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.610
But I also didn't
have the ammunition

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.900
to argue against
her at the time.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.840
So I just kind of said, OK,
and I went and did this story.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.500
But as I went and did the
story, I talked to these guys

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.510
in their offices and
actually it turned out

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.700
that some other blogs
had picked up the news

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:31.960
item from "Hacker News."

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.540
But I was the only one
who actually went and met

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.900
with these guys and tried
to dig into the real story.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.034
I remember just being blown away
as I talked to them with what

00:02:42.034 --> 00:02:42.700
they were doing.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.190
They were young, they were
hungry, they were passionate.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.410
They were these kind
of Mark Zuckerberg

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.710
move fast and break
stuff kind of guys.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.190
I was just astonished by
how they were sacrificing

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.890
everything to try to build
the early infrastructure

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.960
of a new economy.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.670
I became convinced that
Bitcoin had real potential

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.510
and could potentially
change the world.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.300
In fact, the CEO of
that startup ended up

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.270
becoming one of the main
characters in my book.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.490
Back then, the price of a
single Bitcoin, I remember,

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.210
was less than $10 and the value
of all Bitcoins in existence

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.390
was only $96 million.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.610
Today, even with some
recent price drops,

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.880
I think the value of a
Bitcoin is about $2,400

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.490
and the market cap is somewhere
in the tens of billions

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:28.910
of dollars.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.880
So I think I made the right
choice to take it seriously.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.172
OK, but what is Bitcoin?

00:03:36.172 --> 00:03:36.880
How does it work?

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.652
What makes it worth
anything at all?

00:03:39.652 --> 00:03:41.110
Well in the simplest
terms, Bitcoin

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.300
is a form of commodity money.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.240
When it was first
created in January 2009,

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.080
its original promise was to
be a truly universal currency,

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.810
a form of electronic
cash that could be sent

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.430
around the globe in minutes.

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.530
That would work just
as well in New York

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.080
as it did in New Delhi.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.530
Transactions were anonymous, or
at least were supposed to be,

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.350
and it all happened on a network
that existed independently

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.561
of any government or bank.

00:04:07.561 --> 00:04:10.060
The interesting thing to me
when I first heard about Bitcoin

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.140
was I knew that early internet
pioneers had always envisioned

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.450
that a payment's
protocol would be woven

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.610
into the fabric of the web.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.540
You've got a guy like Peter
Thiel who came a bit later.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.970
When he was building PayPal,
his original ambition

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.430
was to create an
internet currency that

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.090
would replace the US dollar
for online transactions.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.400
What kept him from doing
that was not actually

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.230
the popping of the
dot com bubble,

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.430
it was 9/11 and the raft of
new financial regulations

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.100
that came down in the wake
of the terrorist attacks.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.962
They forced him to
pivot away from that.

00:04:44.962 --> 00:04:46.420
Because otherwise
PayPal would have

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.270
been accused of money laundering
and all sorts of other things.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.750
So the brilliant thing that
Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.255
of Bitcoin, did is he
didn't found a new company

00:04:55.255 --> 00:04:56.590
like PayPal.

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.080
Instead, he built a
decentralized system

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.650
that no one would own, but
anyone could participate in.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.350
You'd have this
constantly updated copy

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.990
of the ledger recording
all the transactions that

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.300
would be stored on
the computer of anyone

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.720
on the network, anyone
running the open source

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.390
software of Bitcoin.

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.670
So it started out as the
money of the internet.

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.130
But gradually as
people began to think

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.490
about its underlying technology
and take a closer look at it,

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.935
they began to refer to it
as the internet of money.

00:05:28.935 --> 00:05:30.310
The technology
underlying Bitcoin

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.050
is called the blockchain.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.550
It's basically a
tamper proof ledger

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.590
for recording and
verifying transactions,

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:41.170
which admittedly sounds like the
least sexy thing in the world.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:42.820
But the revolutionary
thing about it

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.700
is that it allows
for transactions

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.220
to be recorded and
verified without the need

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.937
for a central authority.

00:05:48.937 --> 00:05:51.270
So normally that would be a
payments company like PayPal

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.625
or it would be a bank or
it would be a government

00:05:53.625 --> 00:05:56.070
or it would be some
combination of the two

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.710
like the Federal Reserve.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.960
But businesses and services
of blockchain technology

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.120
can be decentralized, which
simultaneously cuts out

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.630
middlemen that add
cost to the system,

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.670
and it removes any
single points of failure

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:11.190
in the system at the same time.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.652
This is disruptive to
a lot of businesses.

00:06:13.652 --> 00:06:16.110
One of the interesting things
when I was working on my book

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.740
was to dig into the
international financial system

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.209
and find out just where
Bitcoin could be most useful.

00:06:23.209 --> 00:06:24.750
One of the biggest
areas I discovered

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.790
was cross-border payments.

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:29.460
So basically the
way it works today,

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.190
when banks want to send
money across borders,

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.220
they use what's called the
corresponding banking system.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.550
A payment might have to make
as many as five different hops

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.312
to get to where it's
ultimately going across all

00:06:41.312 --> 00:06:43.020
of these different
financial institutions

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.850
and be exchanged from
one currency to another.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:48.330
Typically when a bank
wants to send money

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.400
to another bank across
borders, it first

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:56.080
has to be holding cash at
that other institution.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.540
This cash is just
kind of dormant.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:00.420
It's dead cash that just
sits there waiting until they

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.030
need to make payments with it.

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:04.440
This is hugely wasteful.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.540
That cash isn't doing
anything for them

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.590
until they have to
make the payments.

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:11.220
Then on the consumer level,
you have remittances.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.970
This is when immigrants want to
send money back to their loved

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.430
ones in their home countries.

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:20.520
They usually use Western
Union or MoneyGram today,

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.620
and they get charged
really high fees.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:26.310
So migrants from Sub-Saharan
Africa, for instance,

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:30.300
pay an average of 9.81%
when they send money home.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:34.230
The global average is 7.45%,
which itself is really high.

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:37.680
But you might notice there
that often the poorest

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.510
and the people that
are suffering the most

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:42.750
have to end up paying
the highest fees.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:46.470
Well, remittances are a
$600 billion market today.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.290
The idea is that Bitcoin or
maybe another digital currency

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:53.280
that surpasses it has a chance
to grab a piece of that market

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.840
while putting
billions of dollars

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.870
back into people's pockets.

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:00.450
Today in fact there's a
venture backed company called

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:02.420
Abra, which is doing just that.

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.310
It's using Bitcoin to
provide cheaper remittances

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:08.727
to more than 100 countries.

00:08:08.727 --> 00:08:10.560
But what people realized
was that the things

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.270
you store and transmit
on a blockchain

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:14.200
doesn't have to be money.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.230
So one of the first
guys to realize this

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:18.840
was the venture capitalist,
Marc Andreessen.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.610
He wrote an op ed for
"The New York Times"

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:24.570
way back in January 2014
in which he called Bitcoin

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:26.940
not a digital currency,
not a form of money.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.640
He called it a digital
bearer instrument,

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.789
a way of exchanging assets
and confirming their ownership

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:34.409
over the internet.

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:37.110
Those assets could be
digital currency, of course.

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:41.490
They could be the titles and
deeds to physical property.

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:43.590
They could be stocks and bonds.

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:47.107
They could be a number
of different assets.

00:08:47.107 --> 00:08:49.440
So this is the reason the
world's biggest banks and tech

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.360
companies are all setting
up blockchain labs

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.270
and working groups and
building proofs of concept.

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:58.080
This is the reason Bitcoin and
blockchain startups have raised

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.630
something like $1.6
billion of investment

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:03.300
capital in the past few years.

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:06.060
Their investors
include names you

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:10.980
might know, like GV,
Goldman Sachs, Visa,

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:15.750
Capital One, NASDAQ, and
The New York Stock Exchange.

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:19.080
Now if that isn't enough,
the interesting thing

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.300
also is that Bitcoin has
actually inspired people

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.090
to create other crypto
currencies, some of which

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:27.900
have features that arguably
make them superior to Bitcoin.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.680
Then even more than that,
many of the hottest blockchain

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.490
assets today are not
digital currencies at all.

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:35.430
They're these things
called tokens.

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:37.511
They don't have blockchain
networks of their own

00:09:37.511 --> 00:09:38.010
to run on.

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:41.160
Instead, they run on top of an
existing blockchain network,

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.380
such as Bitcoins or Ethereums.

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.820
They tend to be purpose built
for specific applications.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.750
So there's one
called Golem which

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:52.074
is meant to power a peer to peer
marketplace for computation.

00:09:52.074 --> 00:09:53.490
There's one called
Augur, which is

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:57.810
for a crowdsourced
prediction market and so on.

00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:59.644
Dozens of these tokens
have launched so far.

00:09:59.644 --> 00:10:01.518
Some of you have probably
seen the headlines.

00:10:01.518 --> 00:10:03.480
They've been raising
huge amounts of capital

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.180
in unbelievably short
amounts of time.

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:08.630
One raised $10
million in six hours.

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:12.960
Then another raised $35
million in 30 seconds.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:16.740
Another raised $150
million in an hour or two.

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:23.490
The amount raised now for
these software projects

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:27.510
through this new token
model has actually

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:29.160
surpassed the amount
of money that's

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.660
been put in by
traditional venture

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:34.290
capitalists into this
industry so far this year.

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:36.320
That itself is
over $200 million,

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.346
so it's nothing to sneeze at.

00:10:39.346 --> 00:10:41.220
So dozens of these tokens
have been launched,

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.520
and dozens more
are on the horizon.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.990
People are starting
to think this

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:49.350
might yield the second
business model of the internet.

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:51.920
To see why, I think
it helps to think

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.990
about what the current
business model is, right?

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:56.300
So take Facebook.

00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:00.040
If Facebook had issued
a token to its users,

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.640
its value, we could
imagine, would

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.070
derive from the
content and connections

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:06.410
that are generated on Facebook.

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:08.862
Now, early users, when it was
just restricted to college

00:11:08.862 --> 00:11:10.820
students-- there weren't
many people on there--

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.695
they might have been
able to kind of scoop up

00:11:12.695 --> 00:11:16.220
a large number of these
tokens at cheap prices.

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.890
Then later users who kind of
jumped on the bandwagon later

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:22.010
as the value of the
platform became apparent,

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:24.170
maybe they'd only be
able to afford a few.

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:27.050
But all of them, by holding
this liquid digital asset,

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:32.300
would be able to participate
in Facebook's growing success.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.910
That, of course, is not how
Facebook operates, right?

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:38.360
We know that the $450
billion value of Facebook

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.520
accrues mainly to
Mark Zuckerberg

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.980
and the other shareholders.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:44.630
Most other internet
platforms operate

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:49.550
in a similar way, Twitter,
Tumblr, Instagram, even Etsy.

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:52.190
The owners of these
platforms are not actually

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:55.850
producing content themselves,
but they extract massive value

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:58.910
from the interactions
between users.

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:01.250
This has become so
common and so accepted

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:03.440
that it's actually
difficult to imagine

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.540
a different kind of setup.

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:07.910
With decentralized systems
based on blockchain tokens,

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:10.610
though, there's no longer
a division or no longer

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:13.790
such a clear division at least
between the users and owners.

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:16.430
The tokens become a
wealth sharing mechanism,

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:19.260
which is a way that everyone,
even the average consumers,

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.560
the average users,
can get a piece

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.610
of the future of the internet.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:25.610
So the token is kind
of a unit of account

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:29.600
that prices users back in.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.100
It doesn't even end there.

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:32.600
In a couple of years
I'm told we can

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:36.320
expect to see something
called [? perichains. ?]

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.270
Think of it as a kind
of connective glue

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:40.520
that would allow all the
different blockchain networks

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:42.230
to communicate with each other.

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:45.650
So right now they're isolated,
but with [? perichains, ?]

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:48.502
applications and smart
contracts built on one system

00:12:48.502 --> 00:12:50.210
would be able to
interact with the assets

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:53.270
and data on the other systems.

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:56.390
So users could flow easily from
one to the next to the next,

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:58.910
strengthening the
whole ecosystem.

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:01.370
As long as you're keyed
into any cryptocurrency,

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:05.060
you'd have access to
every cryptocurrency.

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:06.980
Because of this, the
CEO of a hedge fund

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:10.820
recently told me that he expects
in 10 years the total market

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:13.640
cap of all blockchain assets
will be at least $1 trillion.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.410
The last thing I want to say
is that the effects of Bitcoin

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:22.620
and blockchain technology
won't be felt only

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:26.622
on the internet or only
in the realm of finance.

00:13:26.622 --> 00:13:28.080
I think Bitcoin
actually represents

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.350
a counterforce to some of
the most troubling trends

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:35.710
of our time, which is the
rising tide of nationalism,

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:40.950
populism, trade protectionism,
and all of this stuff

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:46.840
that we're seeing in the US,
the UK, and across Europe.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.020
So until 2016, I
think for many of us

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:53.520
the world appeared to be moving
inexorably toward open borders,

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:57.840
economic inclusion, closer
alliances between nations,

00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.340
right?

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:02.610
The narrative was that our
global citizenry was rejecting

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:05.700
the old prejudice of
nationalism and tribalism,

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:10.650
and history was describing a
more and more wonderful arc.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:12.384
Well, then we had Brexit, right?

00:14:12.384 --> 00:14:14.050
Then we had the
election of Donald Trump

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:16.080
and we have the refugee crisis.

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.180
That kind of changed
our way of thinking.

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:22.590
But there is still another story
happening at the same time.

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:25.640
I think it's one that many
of us are participating in.

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:28.020
It's about how the way
that people live and work

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:29.130
is changing.

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:31.110
It's about the fact that
international travel

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:33.840
is easier than ever, the fact
that technologies like Skype

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:37.470
have expanded our reach, the
fact that a lot of young people

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:40.470
today see themselves more
as citizens of the world

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:43.020
or of some internet
subculture than they

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:47.280
do their countries of origin.

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.790
So the time really is ripe for
a universal digital currency

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:53.640
and for the other technologies
that it makes possible.

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:57.360
Bitcoin is that currency, or
is at least the first version

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.550
of that currency.

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:02.460
I noticed while writing my
book, and it's still true today,

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:06.270
that very few Bitcoin or
blockchain startups are focused

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:09.592
only on developing nations.

00:15:09.592 --> 00:15:10.800
That's to be expected, right?

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:14.160
Because cryptocurrency is a
tool of international inclusion.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.630
Its advocates tend
to be committed

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:19.080
to open borders and
the free flow of people

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:22.206
and ideas and capital.

00:15:22.206 --> 00:15:25.440
Naval Ravikant, the CEO of
AngelList, one of the smartest

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.980
guys in Silicon Valley,
he recently said

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:31.350
that Bitcoin is a tool
for freeing humanity

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:34.260
from oligarchs and
tyrants dressed up as a

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.500
get rich quick scheme.

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.470
So I guess the last
thought to leave you with

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:42.870
is that Bitcoin has implications
not just for finance

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:47.040
and commerce, but for
politics, digital privacy, law

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.800
enforcement, even citizenship.

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.570
Its story opens a
window onto some

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:53.820
of the most important
issues of our time.

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:56.910
Hopefully we'll get to
discuss a few of those now.

00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:57.748
Thanks.

00:15:57.748 --> 00:16:00.616
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:03.110
SPEAKER 1: All right.

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:04.991
We can transition over here.

00:16:04.991 --> 00:16:06.240
BRIAN PATRICK EHA: No, I know.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.115
SPEAKER 1: All right.

00:16:07.115 --> 00:16:08.640
Now everyone keep me honest.

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:11.775
So at 2:35, please start
lining up at these microphones

00:16:11.775 --> 00:16:14.010
'cause I'm going to
take your questions.

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:15.120
I have a clock here.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.700
But keep me honest,
and line up, please.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.010
OK, thank you.

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:20.010
BRIAN PATRICK EHA: Sure.

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:22.110
SPEAKER 1: So I wanted
to talk a little bit more

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:24.299
about how bitcoins are made.

00:16:24.299 --> 00:16:25.590
And you use this word "mining."

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:25.740
BRIAN PATRICK EHA: Mm.

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:27.740
SPEAKER 1: Can you talk a
little bit about the process?

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:28.910
BRIAN PATRICK EHA: Boy,
that's kind of deep water.

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:30.368
You sure you want
to jump in there?

00:16:30.368 --> 00:16:32.800
SPEAKER 1: Mm, high
level, high level.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:38.280
BRIAN PATRICK EHA: Yeah, so
basically, one of the reasons

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.290
that before bitcoin
no one had ever been

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:43.110
able to create workable
electronic cash was

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:47.070
that electronic files can be
copied ad infinitum, right?

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:48.950
I send a Word document to you.

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:51.010
A copy still remains
on my computer.

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:55.050
So if I have electronic
money on my laptop,

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:57.390
and I send it to
you to spend it,

00:16:57.390 --> 00:16:59.350
but I get to keep it
on my own computer,

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:01.920
right, just like any
other electronic data,

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.450
so this is what's known as
the double spending problem.

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:08.910
And one of the ways that
Satoshi was able to solve that

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:12.180
was through what seems at
first like a counter-intuitive

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:15.000
network that was set up.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.339
But he basically made
the people who are--

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:25.470
he made the people who are
verifying the transactions,

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:26.849
they have to apply
the processing

00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:30.030
power of their computers in
order to confirm and verify

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:31.014
those transactions.

00:17:31.014 --> 00:17:32.430
And in return for
doing that, they

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:34.200
are then rewarded
with new bitcoins.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:38.044
So it's kind of a clearinghouse
and a central mint all in one.

00:17:38.044 --> 00:17:39.210
But it's not a central mint.

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:40.340
It's decentralized.

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:42.090
SPEAKER 1: But-- sorry,
just to interrupt.

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:42.570
BRIAN PATRICK EHA: Yeah, sure.

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:44.280
SPEAKER 1: These aren't just
your average computers, right?

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:45.790
Like, what kind of
computing power are you--

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:47.998
BRIAN PATRICK EHA: Well, in
the early days they were.

00:17:47.998 --> 00:17:51.770
So early on you could just
do it with your laptop.

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:53.370
But what's built
into the system is

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:57.450
that over time, the mathematical
calculations, the numbers

00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:01.080
you have to crunch in order to
confirm transactions and create

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.180
new bitcoins, they
become harder with time

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:05.479
in order to keep
up with Moore's law

00:18:05.479 --> 00:18:07.770
because obviously computers
are a lot more powerful now

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:09.540
than they were in 2009.

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:12.270
And then on top of that, it
was written into the software

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:15.630
that the more processing
power that's applied,

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:17.340
the more difficult
they will become.

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:19.290
So they would become more
difficult over time anyway.

00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:20.873
And then also the
more people that get

00:18:20.873 --> 00:18:23.880
involved and try to do this,
the more difficult it becomes.

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.860
So at first, when there
were only a few people,

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:27.385
you could do it with your GPU--

00:18:27.385 --> 00:18:28.555
or with your CPU, sorry.

00:18:28.555 --> 00:18:30.180
Then it became a
little more difficult.

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:31.860
People started
using their GPUs--

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:34.720
their graphics
processors-- to do this.

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.020
Then even that
became insufficient.

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:38.580
And people started
building ASICs,

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:40.110
which are these
application-specific

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:44.620
processors, just
to mine bitcoins.

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:47.400
And then that turned
into an arms race.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:50.010
And now you have what are
called mining pools, which

00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:53.160
are basically people
with incredibly powerful,

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.802
sophisticated machines--

00:18:55.802 --> 00:18:57.510
not even terribly
sophisticated, frankly,

00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:59.670
but just very powerful.

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:03.060
And they're all pooling their
computer resources together.

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:05.460
And then they kind of
share in the rewards

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:08.670
because it's a race to
confirm the transactions

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:10.560
and then get the bitcoins
every 10 minutes.

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:11.268
SPEAKER 1: Mm-hm.

00:19:11.268 --> 00:19:12.810
BRIAN PATRICK EHA:
And as a result,

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:15.510
you want as much processing
power on your side as possible

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:17.889
to try to increase your
chances of-- yeah--

00:19:17.889 --> 00:19:18.930
SPEAKER 1: Oh, OK, great.

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:20.310
BRIAN PATRICK EHA: --of
getting the currency.

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:21.270
SPEAKER 1: And one
of my favorite parts

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:22.645
about this book--
and I really do

00:19:22.645 --> 00:19:24.870
recommend it-- is all
these amazing stories.

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:26.520
And it doesn't seem
like real life.

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.560
It seems, like, very cinematic.

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.590
But one of my favorite
ones was about Silk Road.

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:31.080
Do you want to just--

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:31.320
BRIAN PATRICK EHA: Oh, sure.

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.694
SPEAKER 1: --set the scene,
talk about the power players,

00:19:33.694 --> 00:19:37.230
and the lessons
learned afterwards?

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:38.910
BRIAN PATRICK EHA:
So it's interesting

00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:41.670
because a lot of people want to
think of Silk Road as very much

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:42.510
in the past.

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:44.655
And in a sense, it is.

00:19:44.655 --> 00:19:45.960
For those who don't know--

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.160
I'm sure most of you do--

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:51.990
Silk Road was this underground
black market only accessible

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:54.510
through the Tor
anonymizing software.

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:58.140
And bitcoins were the only
form of money accepted

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:00.090
on this underground market.

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:02.432
And most of what was
bought and sold--

00:20:02.432 --> 00:20:04.140
not everything on the
market was illegal.

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.630
But most of what was
bought and sold on there

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:08.310
was illegal drugs--

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:09.780
illicit narcotics.

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:13.440
And the impact of Silk
Road really on bitcoin

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.650
can't be overestimated.

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:16.800
It started in January of 2011.

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.320
I mentioned bitcoin
started in January of 2009.

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.330
For the first two
years of its existence,

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:22.980
bitcoin was almost
worthless, I mean,

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:25.590
in terms of monetary value.

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:28.020
The first real transaction
we know of with bitcoins

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:31.350
happened on May 22, 2010.

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:34.230
Someone spent like
25,000 bitcoins

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:35.910
to get somebody
in another country

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:39.420
to order him a couple of
Dominoes pizzas online.

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:42.387
I mean, 25,000 bitcoins
today is like [CHUCKLES]

00:20:42.387 --> 00:20:43.845
unbelievable--
millions of dollars.

00:20:43.845 --> 00:20:45.020
SPEAKER 1: Oh my god.

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:45.950
BRIAN PATRICK EHA:
But that was just

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:47.730
a kind of proof of concept,
like, yeah, all right,

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:48.270
it works.

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:48.936
You can do this.

00:20:48.936 --> 00:20:51.000
But nobody was really doing it.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.160
Well, Silk Road launched.

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.680
And they said for
anonymity, privacy reasons,

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:58.260
we're only going
to accept bitcoin.

00:20:58.260 --> 00:20:59.760
Within a very short
amount of time--

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.380
I mean, just days--

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:03.240
the price of one bitcoin
had reached parity

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:05.550
with the US dollar
and has actually

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:07.680
never fallen below it since.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.730
I mean, as much as the
price has fluctuated,

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:12.000
it's always had real
worth since then.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.940
It's never gone below $1.

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:18.030
And so, yeah, I mean,
in the early days,

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:20.220
Silk Road really
formed a huge part

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:23.400
of the actual total
bitcoin economy.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:25.860
And then a couple of copycat
markets started springing up.

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:28.332
And they contributed
to it as well.

00:21:28.332 --> 00:21:29.790
But by the time
Silk Road shut down

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:33.870
in October of 2013, what
people eventually realized

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:37.860
was, oh, actually bitcoin
can survive without this.

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:40.740
It doesn't rely entirely just
on this underground criminal

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:42.030
economy.

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:44.310
A lot of people had
thought, well, that's it,

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:45.212
Silk Road's gone.

00:21:45.212 --> 00:21:46.170
Bitcoin's going to die.

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:47.670
That's all it was used for.

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:48.719
In many people's minds--

00:21:48.719 --> 00:21:50.760
those who knew about
bitcoin in those days-- that

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.130
was all it was was this
kind of criminal currency.

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:55.620
And it turned out
not to be the case.

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:57.930
At the same time, though,
the criminal use case for it

00:21:57.930 --> 00:22:00.030
has not gone away either.

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:02.730
There are still a number of
these markets that exist today.

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:04.890
And people are still using them.

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:07.680
But I think I talked to
a researcher recently

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:11.070
who said it's like, I think,
a $500 million-a-year business

00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:13.659
or market he estimated,
which is large.

00:22:13.659 --> 00:22:16.200
But when you think of bitcoin's
total market cap and the fact

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.800
that billions of
dollars of bitcoins

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:22.680
are trading hands every
day pretty much now,

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:25.320
it's really not such a
big percentage, yeah.

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:26.094
SPEAKER 1: Great.

00:22:26.094 --> 00:22:28.260
And for the average person,
if I were, just today, I

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:31.450
wanted to start using bitcoin,
how do I start that process?

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:33.570
How do you go about
getting a wallet?

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:37.030
And I think that it's great
because big banks are not

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:37.530
involved.

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:39.180
But the price of
that is that you

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.070
are responsible for
your own protection.

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:43.530
And so what measures
can the average person

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:45.270
take to make sure
that their money won't

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:46.375
get stolen by hackers?

00:22:46.375 --> 00:22:48.000
BRIAN PATRICK EHA:
Well, there actually

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.790
are some services that will
keep your money for you

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:51.750
if you want it.

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:54.925
And they range from the
unreliable to the very,

00:22:54.925 --> 00:22:57.420
I think, vetted and respectable.

00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:02.910
And they have various methods
of securing your currency.

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:05.700
One of them for
yourself is to just

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:08.430
keep it on an air-gapped
hard drive or something

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:11.100
like that, to keep your
digital wallet not connected

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:13.200
to the internet, at least
for the vast majority

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.227
of your holdings.

00:23:14.227 --> 00:23:15.810
I think to come back
to the first part

00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:19.620
of your question, how to get
them, it's actually pretty easy

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:20.250
nowadays.

00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:24.040
I mean living in the US, there's
a company called Coinbase.

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:27.150
You just sign up for an account.

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:29.070
You have to verify your
identity the same way

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:31.770
you would for if you're
opening a bank account.

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:36.480
And then you deposit money from
your bank through ACH transfer.

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.797
And it takes five days
or something like that.

00:23:38.797 --> 00:23:40.630
But once you have the
money in your account,

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:42.270
you can buy the bitcoins.

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:43.830
They also let you
buy ether, which

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:45.840
is the native token of
the Ethereum network.

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:49.410
And they let you buy litecoin,
which was the first alternative

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:53.190
to bitcoin, the first alt
coin, as they call them,

00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:55.060
that was created.

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:56.220
So it's fairly easy.

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:58.050
I mean, for more
sophisticated trading,

00:23:58.050 --> 00:24:01.090
there are a lot of
exchanges out there online.

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:03.145
They run 24 hours a
day, seven days a week.

00:24:03.145 --> 00:24:05.770
I mean, it's really unbelievable
to see these markets in action

00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:07.860
because they do not have
opening and closing bells

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:09.750
like the New York Stock Market.

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:13.630
The action is fast and furious
and all around the clock.

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:15.480
And some of them let
you do margin trading.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:17.554
They let you do market--

00:24:17.554 --> 00:24:20.220
I mean, they let you do a lot of
different sophisticated trading

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:22.530
strategies.

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:23.700
Bittrex is one of them.

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:25.910
Bitfinex, Poloniex.

00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:30.372
They don't all end in X.
But Bitstamp, GDEX-- there's

00:24:30.372 --> 00:24:31.080
a number of them.

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:33.870
But yeah, Coinbase will give
you a kind of simple wallet

00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:37.080
and buying and selling
structure all in one.

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:37.850
So--

00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:39.150
SPEAKER 1: Great, thank you.

00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:41.340
So also in the book
that you highlighted

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:43.470
the growing pains that
comes with getting

00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:44.460
started with bitcoin.

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:45.876
Can we talk a
little bit about Mt.

00:24:45.876 --> 00:24:48.700
Gox and then so
how pretty much--

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:49.700
BRIAN PATRICK EHA: Sure.

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:50.510
SPEAKER 1: --like--

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:52.080
BRIAN PATRICK EHA: These
are such large questions.

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.804
I'm just like, there's
10 different ways

00:24:53.804 --> 00:24:54.970
to answer each one of these.

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:57.071
So I'm struggling a little bit.

00:24:57.071 --> 00:24:57.570
So Mount--

00:24:57.570 --> 00:25:01.110
SPEAKER 1: Well, so I would be
concerned about if you forget

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:03.090
your password, if there
is a hack you can't--

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:04.506
you can never get
your money back.

00:25:04.506 --> 00:25:07.680
So I guess I'm just curious to
hear about what has improved

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.060
since then, I guess.

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:10.810
BRIAN PATRICK EHA:
Well, I mean, one thing

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:12.390
is don't leave all
of your holdings

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:15.330
on an exchange that's connected
to the internet, right?

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:17.880
So if you've kind of heavily
invested in this stuff,

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:21.180
and you have $50,000
worth of digital currency,

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:24.180
I would encourage you not to
leave all of that in a place.

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:27.152
I mean it might seem great
to have it all on an exchange

00:25:27.152 --> 00:25:29.610
that if the price goes up or
down and you want to buy more,

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:31.650
you want to sell
and make a profit,

00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:33.600
you can access it instantly.

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.700
But if the exchange
is hacked, if they

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:39.210
don't have proper protections,
you do run a risk, right?

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:40.140
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:41.765
BRIAN PATRICK EHA:
So I would encourage

00:25:41.765 --> 00:25:44.130
people to maybe
buy on an exchange,

00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:47.820
then take most of their
holdings, put them offline.

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:49.845
Make a backup of that wallet.

00:25:49.845 --> 00:25:53.310
Many of these wallets
you can get 2FA for.

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:55.770
Some of them have what's
called multisig protection,

00:25:55.770 --> 00:25:59.580
where you actually need--
it's like a two of three

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:00.370
kind of thing.

00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:04.190
So one person is not able to
access the funds completely

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:07.737
by themselves, which is an
extra layer of protection.

00:26:07.737 --> 00:26:09.320
There's a number of
different security

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:12.570
methods, which I honestly find
a little bit boring to talk

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:13.070
about.

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:13.400
But--

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:13.670
SPEAKER 1: No.

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:13.880
[INAUDIBLE]

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:14.040
BRIAN PATRICK EHA: No, no, no.

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:14.540
It's OK.

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:15.370
I'm just kidding.

00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:16.469
But Mt.

00:26:16.469 --> 00:26:18.260
Gox was the world's
first bitcoin exchange.

00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:20.630
These 24-hour online exchanges
I'm talking about, Mt.

00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:21.740
Gox was the first one.

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:23.450
It launched in 2010.

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:25.130
It was based in Japan.

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:28.550
And the problem was it
turned out the guy running

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:31.827
it was not very competent.

00:26:31.827 --> 00:26:33.410
I remember one of
the former employees

00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:37.420
said it was like running
on a spaghetti code base.

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:39.080
It was just kind of messed up.

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.240
And to be honest,
they're still untangling

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.050
what went wrong there.

00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:45.290
But, yeah, either there
was an inside job,

00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:47.390
or there were some
pretty catastrophic hacks

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:48.350
that happened.

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:50.600
And it seems like the
CEO might have covered

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:54.500
that up for a
while and basically

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:57.740
let it become
catastrophic, yeah,

00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:00.590
the same way that the
collapse of Lehman Brothers

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:03.315
was catastrophic or something
like that because they

00:27:03.315 --> 00:27:05.690
hid the problems with their
balance sheet for a long time

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:08.450
until it became impossible
to hide, right, so--

00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:09.200
SPEAKER 1: Got it.

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:09.906
BRIAN PATRICK EHA: Yeah.

00:27:09.906 --> 00:27:10.254
SPEAKER 1: So I'm curious--

00:27:10.254 --> 00:27:10.372
BRIAN PATRICK EHA: But--

00:27:10.372 --> 00:27:10.840
SPEAKER 1: --about--

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:11.750
BRIAN PATRICK EHA:
Sorry to interrupt.

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:13.499
I was just going to
say, since those days,

00:27:13.499 --> 00:27:16.130
there are a lot more
vetted, more trustworthy,

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:17.750
better-run exchanges out there.

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:19.510
And many of them are regulated.

00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:22.430
They have to do AML
and KYC compliance,

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:24.325
just like a lot
of other regulated

00:27:24.325 --> 00:27:25.325
financial institutions--

00:27:25.325 --> 00:27:25.910
SPEAKER 1: Just know
your customer and just--

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:26.951
BRIAN PATRICK EHA: Right.

00:27:26.951 --> 00:27:29.240
Anti-money laundering-- know
your customer and so on.

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:31.040
Some of them are
based in the US.

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:34.232
And they have to comply with a
lot of regulations today, yeah.

00:27:34.232 --> 00:27:34.940
SPEAKER 1: Great.

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:37.220
And so how did you first
get involved with bitcoin?

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:38.480
What is it that drew you in?

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:40.340
And I thought it was so funny
that your editor said, oh, this

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:40.460
is a--

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:40.640
BRIAN PATRICK EHA: Oh yeah.

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.650
SPEAKER 1: This little
thing, it's a fad.

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:45.001
What was the first sense
that you got that this

00:27:45.001 --> 00:27:46.250
could be something really big?

00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:48.850
Because you've been researching
this for five-plus years now.

00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:49.850
BRIAN PATRICK EHA: Yeah.

00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:52.820
Well, like I said, I mean, when
I first encountered bitcoin,

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:55.130
it seemed to me like an
idea whose time had come.

00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:58.530
But I didn't know whether it
was really going to become huge

00:27:58.530 --> 00:27:59.030
or not.

00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:01.010
I thought it had the
potential to become big.

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:04.490
But I think the easy thing would
be to sit here and make myself

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:06.710
Nostradamus and
say, I always knew

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:09.140
it would go up to
$3,000 per bitcoin.

00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:12.530
And I always knew there'd be
billions of dollars in venture

00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:14.180
capital flowing into the space.

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:16.167
I mean, I didn't
always know that.

00:28:16.167 --> 00:28:17.750
What I did know was
that I was looking

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:20.390
at some very smart
guys who were--

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:23.840
their minds were just throwing
off sparks as I talked to them.

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.870
And the technology seemed sound.

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:29.847
It seemed like something that
had never existed before.

00:28:29.847 --> 00:28:31.430
Some people have
criticized it, saying

00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:33.730
it's a solution in
search of a problem.

00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:36.830
But I don't really
find that to be true.

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:39.380
From the first time I
heard about it I thought,

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:42.530
wow, this is something that no
one was ever able to do before.

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:46.100
You didn't have
non-counterfeitable digital

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:48.210
cash ever before.

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:50.810
And you didn't have a way to
send money peer to peer across

00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:55.490
borders, just without involving
any payments company, any bank,

00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:57.480
any third party at all.

00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:59.930
I remember one of the things
that stuck out in my mind

00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:05.030
in the early days was
when PayPal and others had

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:07.430
instituted a blockade
against WikiLeaks.

00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:09.770
They weren't allowing
any of their users

00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:13.490
to donate to WikiLeaks
because of some of the things

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:15.770
it had done involving
government secrets.

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:16.770
SPEAKER 1: So the fact--

00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:16.940
BRIAN PATRICK EHA: So--

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:18.940
SPEAKER 1: --that they could
control your money like that.

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:19.490
BRIAN PATRICK EHA: Right, right.

00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:20.340
SPEAKER 1: That's
the difference here.

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:21.470
BRIAN PATRICK EHA: So
I mean, and that might

00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:23.030
be what you call an edge case.

00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:25.480
But it is certainly a case.

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:27.230
And it was something
that stuck in my mind

00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:30.530
because what people started
doing was donating in bitcoins.

00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:32.660
WikiLeaks very quickly started--

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:35.570
they found a way to start
accepting donations in bitcoin.

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:38.460
And people started donating
these digital currencies.

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:39.680
And no one could stop that.

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:40.880
No one could forbid that.

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:43.670
No one can keep you from
sending digital currency

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:45.410
to your grandmother
in Cuba, even

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:49.200
if Trump re-institutes all
of the sanctions against Cuba

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.250
and so on.

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:53.995
And I found that to be
really, really fascinating.

00:29:53.995 --> 00:29:55.086
SPEAKER 1: Great.

00:29:55.086 --> 00:29:56.210
So just one-minute warning.

00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:57.020
We'll do one more question.

00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:57.520
And then--

00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:57.730
BRIAN PATRICK EHA: Sure.

00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:00.188
SPEAKER 1: --if everyone could
line up for their questions.

00:30:00.188 --> 00:30:02.611
So in all the stories that
were involved in your book,

00:30:02.611 --> 00:30:03.860
what is one of your favorites?

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:06.500
What is one that you
enjoyed the most covering?

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:07.746
BRIAN PATRICK EHA: Sure.

00:30:07.746 --> 00:30:09.620
Well, there was this
guy named Charlie Shrem.

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:11.870
Some of you might
have heard about him.

00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:14.090
He was actually the
CEO of that company

00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:17.600
that I first wrote
about for CNN Money.

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:20.505
And he was just a
middle-class guy living

00:30:20.505 --> 00:30:22.880
with his parents in Brooklyn
when he heard about bitcoin.

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:24.740
He was like 21 years old.

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:29.180
And partly through
happenstance, partly

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:33.172
through sheer will and
determination and intelligence

00:30:33.172 --> 00:30:35.130
and being in the right
place at the right time,

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:37.550
he ended up
co-founding what became

00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:39.200
one of the largest,
most significant

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.610
of the early bitcoin startups.

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:43.250
It was actually the first to
raise a significant amount

00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:44.750
of venture capital.

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:49.250
It raised to $1 and 1/2 million
in the fall of 2012, which

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:51.230
seems like a small
amount of money now.

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:54.290
But like I said, the market
cap of all the bitcoins

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:58.250
in existence back then was
only $100 million or less.

00:30:58.250 --> 00:31:01.250
And at one point, this
company was handling 30%

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:02.650
of all bitcoin transactions.

00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:05.720
They were flowing
through BitInstant.

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:09.230
And then through-- this is kind
of spoiler alert for the book--

00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:12.380
but through some
things he got up to,

00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:16.520
he ended up getting charged
by federal prosecutors

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:20.720
and having to spend a
year in federal prison.

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:21.570
And now he's out.

00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:23.778
And he's actually working
on a comeback, which I just

00:31:23.778 --> 00:31:26.720
wrote about for the July
issue of "Fortune" magazine.

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:30.260
But to me, there's a pathos
there of this middle-class kid

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:36.200
made good and his assent to this
level where he was clearly--

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:37.700
I thought of all
the main characters

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:40.520
I followed in the book, he
was clearly the most gratified

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:43.190
by the attention and
the respect that he

00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:45.200
got as a result of his work.

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:48.227
And then his fall
from grace, and then

00:31:48.227 --> 00:31:50.810
being kind of disowned by some
of the people he had previously

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:53.350
rubbed shoulders with,
including his investors,

00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:56.280
and now being out and
working on a comeback.

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:59.464
So yeah, there's just something
there that I find compelling.

00:31:59.464 --> 00:32:00.380
SPEAKER 1: Absolutely.

00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:00.620
BRIAN PATRICK EHA: Yeah.

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:01.910
SPEAKER 1: OK, great.

00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:04.020
So if any questions
in the audience,

00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:06.454
you'd like to come and line
up now, we can get started.

00:32:06.454 --> 00:32:08.120
BRIAN PATRICK EHA:
Yeah, I know that was

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:09.200
a bit all over the place.

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:09.700
I'm sorry.

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:10.210
[CHUCKLES]

00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:12.746
SPEAKER 1: And so you
have to read the book.

00:32:12.746 --> 00:32:14.629
OK, go ahead.

00:32:14.629 --> 00:32:16.170
AUDIENCE: Hi, my
name is [? Arian. ?]

00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:17.170
BRIAN PATRICK EHA: Sure.

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:20.330
AUDIENCE: So the question I had
was following everything that's

00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:24.410
been going on, the way
people hold coins in a sense

00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:27.080
is like they're holding stock
and not necessarily like they

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:29.830
have a piece of
currency or value.

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:31.820
And I think that's created
a lot of volatility

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:34.120
in the price of
bitcoin, ethereum,

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:36.740
all these other things,
which makes them harder

00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:39.050
to use as currencies,
which is what some of them

00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:40.615
are meant to be.

00:32:40.615 --> 00:32:41.990
What do you think
needs to happen

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:43.240
for that not to be the case?

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:45.750
Because when people
buy real currency--

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:50.970
non-cryptocurrencies-- they're
used a lot more than bitcoin

00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:51.470
is.

00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:53.136
And some people are
just holding bitcoin

00:32:53.136 --> 00:32:55.525
for the sake of holding it.

00:32:55.525 --> 00:32:57.150
So I guess the question
is, what do you

00:32:57.150 --> 00:32:58.649
think needs to
happen to create more

00:32:58.649 --> 00:33:03.134
stability in the cryptocurrency
market versus volatility?

00:33:03.134 --> 00:33:04.550
BRIAN PATRICK EHA:
To be honest, I

00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:06.740
think there are different
schools of thought

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:07.594
about this, right.

00:33:07.594 --> 00:33:09.260
A traditional economist
would look at it

00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:11.480
and say, how can these
be currencies when

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.260
their value fluctuates so much?

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:15.320
They can't be used as a
stable unit of account,

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:17.600
that basically the
three qualities that

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.550
make something a
currency typically

00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:22.907
are that it's a store of value,
which bitcoin certainly is.

00:33:22.907 --> 00:33:24.740
You're talking about
people trying to use it

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:26.330
as a store of value, right.

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:28.190
It's a unit of exchange,
which bitcoin is.

00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:32.327
It can be used to buy goods and
services or sent peer to peer.

00:33:32.327 --> 00:33:34.410
But then the third is that
it's a unit of account.

00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:37.910
And that is one that bitcoin's
not really used for that today.

00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:41.559
And it's partly because
the price is so volatile.

00:33:41.559 --> 00:33:43.100
But there's another
school of thought

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:46.400
that says, actually,
the volatility is OK.

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:49.670
The speculation is OK
because before bitcoin

00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:53.480
can become a truly global
currency that can really

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.340
serve a huge global user base--

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:57.770
and actually it's
worth mentioning

00:33:57.770 --> 00:34:01.190
that a month or two ago, a study
out of Cambridge University

00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:04.250
found that the number of people
now using cryptocurrencies

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:07.714
worldwide rivals the
population of small countries.

00:34:07.714 --> 00:34:08.880
So that's pretty impressive.

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:13.489
But even that, it's not a
giant global user base, right?

00:34:13.489 --> 00:34:15.260
But they say right
now the market cap

00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:19.219
of bitcoin's in the $30
billions or about $40 billion

00:34:19.219 --> 00:34:21.679
or something like that.

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:24.320
Really, its market cap needs
to be much higher, I think,

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:26.530
before it can serve a
truly global user base.

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:30.199
It needs to be maybe
even 10 times higher

00:34:30.199 --> 00:34:33.409
when you compare it to
the amount of US dollars

00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:35.449
that are out there,
for instance.

00:34:35.449 --> 00:34:37.250
So actually, the
speculation is OK.

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:38.958
The fact that some
people are hoarding it

00:34:38.958 --> 00:34:42.590
might be OK because if it
makes it more valuable,

00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:46.820
if it makes it more scarce,
and that drives the price up,

00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:51.199
that might be when we see its
function as a currency start

00:34:51.199 --> 00:34:53.635
to really come to the fore.

00:34:53.635 --> 00:34:55.010
The other answer
to your question

00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:58.190
is that there are actually
technological solutions

00:34:58.190 --> 00:35:01.080
to the volatility that allow it
to still be used as a currency.

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:04.700
So for instance,
payment processors who

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:06.980
exists in the bitcoin
industry today,

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:10.190
they are willing to take
on that volatility risk

00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:11.310
on behalf of the merchant.

00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:14.900
So if you have bitcoins, and
you want to use them to buy

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:19.730
bedsheets or something like
that from Overstock.com--

00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:21.560
and they do accept bitcoins--

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:23.480
you will send the
bitcoins to Overstock.

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:26.220
But Overstock actually won't be
exposed to the volatility risk.

00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:28.280
They don't handle the
bitcoins themselves.

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:31.520
It gets accepted for them
by their merchant, payment

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:34.070
provider, which I believe
for them is Coinbase,

00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:35.900
or it might be a
company called BitPay.

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:38.720
That company then will
exchange the currency for them

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:41.262
almost immediately
and give them the cash

00:35:41.262 --> 00:35:43.220
that they want to keep
as their unit of account

00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:44.630
for their bookkeeping.

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:48.620
And you're happy because you got
to spend your digital currency

00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:49.821
the way you wanted to.

00:35:49.821 --> 00:35:52.070
The merchant is happy because
they got the US dollars.

00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:54.350
And the merchant
services provider

00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:56.900
is happy because they
made a little percentage

00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:58.110
on that transaction.

00:35:58.110 --> 00:35:59.860
So you know--

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:02.119
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:36:02.119 --> 00:36:02.702
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:36:02.702 --> 00:36:03.658
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:36:03.658 --> 00:36:06.660
I was curious to see what your
thoughts on the flippening are

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:09.810
and where you see, like, the
bitcoin-versus-ethereum debate

00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:12.450
going and what maybe the
advantages and disadvantages

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:14.610
of the two are.

00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:18.042
BRIAN PATRICK EHA: Yeah, I
mean, so really big question.

00:36:18.042 --> 00:36:19.500
What he's talking
about is the idea

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:21.560
that some people
have that ethereum

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:24.030
is going to overtake bitcoin
in terms of its market cap,

00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:27.084
in terms of its just
overall use case,

00:36:27.084 --> 00:36:29.250
that maybe there aren't
that many things bitcoin can

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:30.870
do that ethereum can't do.

00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:32.400
Ethereum right
now is the world's

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:36.870
second-biggest cryptocurrency by
market cap, by number of users,

00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:39.430
and so on.

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:44.429
As a journalist, I kind
of cherish the fact

00:36:44.429 --> 00:36:45.970
that I can be somewhat
of an observer

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:48.760
and not have to, like,
take a very partisan side

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:50.927
because there are
a lot of partisans

00:36:50.927 --> 00:36:52.510
right now in the
cryptocurrency space.

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:55.420
And you can talk to one guy,
and he'll swear up and down

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:57.719
that ethereum is
practically a scam

00:36:57.719 --> 00:36:59.260
and that there's no
reason you should

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:00.280
use anything but bitcoin.

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:01.738
And then there are
other people who

00:37:01.738 --> 00:37:04.050
say ethereum's more
sophisticated than bitcoin.

00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:09.260
And I think they somewhat
have different use cases.

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:12.520
And I do think that bitcoin
today still has an incredibly

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:15.740
strong first mover advantage.

00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:19.180
It has an unparalleled network
effect, unparalleled name

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:20.230
recognition.

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:22.392
If I go to the average
person and I say,

00:37:22.392 --> 00:37:24.100
have you heard of
bitcoin, they might not

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:25.058
know anything about it.

00:37:25.058 --> 00:37:27.130
But they might say, yeah,
that sounds familiar.

00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:28.240
But if I say, do you
know what ethereum

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:29.700
is, they're going
to probably say,

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:32.170
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

00:37:32.170 --> 00:37:34.690
And frankly, that is one of
the first obstacles ethereum

00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:37.890
would have to overcome.

00:37:37.890 --> 00:37:39.940
I think we know from
the technology space

00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:42.460
that in order for one
service or one product

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:45.730
to overtake a rival one, it
can't just be like 10% better,

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:46.360
right?

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:50.170
It needs to be twice as good or
five times as good sometimes.

00:37:50.170 --> 00:37:52.660
And I'm not sure for
most people ethereum

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:54.300
fits those
qualifications right now,

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:56.830
especially, I mean,
bitcoin right now

00:37:56.830 --> 00:37:59.680
is having some trouble
scaling the network up

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:02.380
to serve a global user base.

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:04.450
Transactions are taking longer.

00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:07.140
They're becoming more
costly and so on.

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:09.670
I mean, the transactions
themselves are instantaneous.

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:12.730
But the time it takes to confirm
the transactions on the network

00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:15.820
to verify that they're
valid, that's taking longer.

00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:17.320
So some people were
saying, oh yeah,

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:20.770
bitcoin is like becoming
a stick in the mud.

00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:22.660
All those people-- the
competing stakeholders

00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:24.941
in the bitcoin system--
they can't work out

00:38:24.941 --> 00:38:25.690
their differences.

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:27.439
They can't come to
agreement on a proposal

00:38:27.439 --> 00:38:29.760
for how to upgrade the
software and move forward

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:31.900
to scale the network.

00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:34.360
So obviously, ethereum is
just going to eat its lunch.

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:38.080
But we just this past week saw
some problems with the ethereum

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:40.180
network, where transactions
were getting clogged,

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:41.656
and there were some issues.

00:38:41.656 --> 00:38:43.030
So I think that
took the wind out

00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:46.450
of the sails of a lot of people
that previously had thought,

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:50.390
like, it's just clear sailing
for ethereum from here on out.

00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:50.945
So--

00:38:50.945 --> 00:38:51.778
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:51.778 --> 00:38:52.837
BRIAN PATRICK EHA: Yeah.

00:38:52.837 --> 00:38:54.420
AUDIENCE: Hey, great
to have you here.

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:55.450
BRIAN PATRICK EHA: Sure.

00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:58.270
AUDIENCE: Such an astonishing
five years in the crypto world.

00:38:58.270 --> 00:39:01.120
And it's all very exciting,
with distributed applications

00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:01.670
and so on.

00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:03.910
But as you know, Mike
Hearn is probably

00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:06.450
the most famous Googler
that advocated for bitcoin

00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:08.320
and joined the
bitcoin corp. And he

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:11.470
quit because of infighting
and debates over the direction

00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:12.880
that it should take.

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:14.434
Given the amount
of trust that has

00:39:14.434 --> 00:39:19.480
to be placed in the developers
for these different coins

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:21.370
and the amount of
infighting that goes on--

00:39:21.370 --> 00:39:22.370
BRIAN PATRICK EHA: Yeah.

00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:27.760
AUDIENCE: --are we still blocked
on some kind of governance

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:33.640
solution to actually make these
kinds of things successful?

00:39:36.299 --> 00:39:37.840
BRIAN PATRICK EHA:
Well, that's where

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:39.730
some of the
alternatives to bitcoin

00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:43.090
become potentially interesting.

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:45.940
There's one called Dash,
which some people think

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:49.660
in terms of its innovations
as a form of digital cash

00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:51.460
or cryptocurrency or
whatever it might not

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:53.944
be a huge improvement
over bitcoin.

00:39:53.944 --> 00:39:55.360
What's really
interesting about it

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:59.170
is its innovation in
the governance model.

00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:04.810
So with Dash, basically, the
network kind of administrators,

00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:06.790
in a sense, are people
running these things

00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:08.284
called master nodes.

00:40:08.284 --> 00:40:09.700
And in order to
run a master node,

00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:11.860
you have to own at
least 1,000 Dash.

00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:15.400
So you have to be very much
a stakeholder in the network.

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:20.380
And then proposals
for doing marketing

00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:23.620
for the network, proposals
to upgrade the software,

00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:26.650
add new features, or
any number of things--

00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:30.640
they all on a monthly
basis get put up for a vote

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:33.850
by all of the people
running master nodes.

00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:35.559
Now it's still a
decentralized system.

00:40:35.559 --> 00:40:37.600
In fact, many of the people
running master nodes,

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:40.090
it's not even known
who they are exactly.

00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:42.220
And one individual could
run, theoretically,

00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:43.325
more than one master node.

00:40:43.325 --> 00:40:44.950
But there are thousands
of master nodes

00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:46.510
right now on the network.

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:49.750
And even the development team
for Dash is actually beholden

00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:53.620
to their approval because the
way Dash works is that some

00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:56.920
of the new Dash coins-- if
you want to call them that--

00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:00.070
that are created every
month, they actually

00:41:00.070 --> 00:41:03.400
get allocated as funding
for the developers

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:05.500
to pay the developer
talent and so

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:08.620
on to keep working on
the system, improving it,

00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:09.700
and so on.

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:12.100
But they have to
actually propose

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:13.810
to the stakeholders
of the network,

00:41:13.810 --> 00:41:15.770
this is what we'd like to do.

00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:18.370
And then there's a
democratic process

00:41:18.370 --> 00:41:20.050
in which that gets voted on.

00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:23.290
And sometimes their
proposals don't pass.

00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:26.175
But it's a way to kind of keep
the developers honest and keep

00:41:26.175 --> 00:41:28.550
the interests, I think, of
all the different stakeholders

00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:29.860
in the network aligned.

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:32.320
The developers rely on
them for their funding.

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:33.790
At the same time,
the stakeholders

00:41:33.790 --> 00:41:37.300
rely on the developers in
order to keep the network going

00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:41.070
strong, which makes their Dash
coins valuable and incentivizes

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:43.890
them to run the master nodes
in the first place and so on.

00:41:43.890 --> 00:41:48.060
So that, to me, is a really
interesting governance model.

00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:50.482
I don't know whether Dash
will one day replace bitcoin

00:41:50.482 --> 00:41:51.690
for that reason or something.

00:41:51.690 --> 00:41:54.570
But people are starting to
innovate, not just on aspects

00:41:54.570 --> 00:41:58.080
of the technology itself
but on aspects of the way

00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:00.690
that these decentralized
networks are governed.

00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:04.650
And yeah, I mean, bitcoin
is very much the 1.0.

00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:07.350
It's had to go through
all these growing pains.

00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:10.110
And people didn't know
how this stuff would

00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:13.489
work until they had to do it.

00:42:13.489 --> 00:42:15.030
But as one guy put
it to me recently,

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:16.446
the nice thing
about bitcoin is it

00:42:16.446 --> 00:42:18.600
is going through all
these growing pains.

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:22.200
And so it is becoming kind
of more trusted, in a sense,

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:26.550
simply because it has shown its
resilience despite scandals,

00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:28.350
despite the hacks of
bitcoin exchanges,

00:42:28.350 --> 00:42:31.450
despite some bitcoin
startups failing, and so on.

00:42:33.825 --> 00:42:34.775
AUDIENCE: Hey there.

00:42:34.775 --> 00:42:35.250
My name's Nick.

00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:35.730
BRIAN PATRICK EHA: Hey.

00:42:35.730 --> 00:42:38.180
AUDIENCE: So my question's
around the ethereum network

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:40.370
and really the
speculation around moving

00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:42.299
to a proof of stakes concept.

00:42:42.299 --> 00:42:43.340
BRIAN PATRICK EHA: Mm-hm.

00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:44.930
AUDIENCE: So I guess
the question is,

00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:46.730
is that what's stopping
big players from entering

00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:48.854
the game at that point in
a proof-of-stakes network

00:42:48.854 --> 00:42:52.040
or a proof-of-stakes concept
and them taking a large market

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:55.300
share on the computing
power, essentially

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:58.540
removing maybe the concept
of the decentralized network?

00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:00.860
Or is that not even
a problem at all?

00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:02.443
BRIAN PATRICK EHA:
Well, to be honest,

00:43:02.443 --> 00:43:04.820
I'm not as much of an
expert on the underpinnings

00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:06.940
of the ethereum network as I--

00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:09.650
I don't know quite as much
about the proof-of-stakes system

00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:11.810
and how all of that is
handled as I do about, like,

00:43:11.810 --> 00:43:16.040
the proof-of-work system
that bitcoin uses.

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:18.770
But yeah, I mean, I think
people do have concerns

00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:21.440
that some of the power
in the ethereum network

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:24.800
is already concentrated
in too few hands.

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:28.700
I mean, the fact that the
network forked last year

00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:31.010
and essentially split into
two versions-- you have

00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:33.567
what they call ethereum, but
it's actually the new ethereum.

00:43:33.567 --> 00:43:35.900
And then you have what they
call ethereum classic, which

00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:38.870
is the original network.

00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:42.530
And that happened because
there was a big hack and theft

00:43:42.530 --> 00:43:44.840
of this one investment
vehicle that was running

00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:46.370
on the ethereum network.

00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:49.460
And millions of dollars worth
of ether were stolen from it.

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:53.880
And so the top leaders
of the ethereum network,

00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:56.870
including the guy
mostly credited

00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:59.150
as its creator, this guy
named Vitalik Buterin,

00:43:59.150 --> 00:44:02.930
they decided, OK, we're
going to roll this back

00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:06.080
and make it so that this
thief doesn't profit

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:07.610
from his ill-gotten gains.

00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:10.190
But the way to do that
in a blockchain network

00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:12.410
is that you basically
have to fork the network.

00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:15.920
And if everyone had
agreed, then maybe they

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:19.040
would have all moved
over to the new network.

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.490
But some didn't.

00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:22.430
And some people
decided to continue

00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:25.760
putting developing resources
and time and effort

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:27.410
into the original network.

00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:32.120
And so now you have actually two
different networks, one which

00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:35.030
has stayed sort of immutable,
and no transactions have ever

00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:38.060
been rolled back, and then this
new one that actually today is

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:41.360
much more valuable in
terms of its market cap

00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:47.210
but which some people think
is really not so trustworthy

00:44:47.210 --> 00:44:51.267
because it's possible that
some of these big stakeholders,

00:44:51.267 --> 00:44:52.850
at any time they
don't like something,

00:44:52.850 --> 00:44:55.550
they might choose to undo it.

00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:59.266
And the only thing, in a sense,
stopping them from doing that--

00:44:59.266 --> 00:45:00.700
well, maybe not the only thing.

00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:03.980
But the main thing
people are relying on

00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:07.340
is they just say,
well, we won't, right?

00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:10.040
Another issue that
I have with ethereum

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:13.850
is that I think it's a bit
more of a, I don't want

00:45:13.850 --> 00:45:15.800
to say exactly a
cult of personality,

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:18.140
but there is a bit of
a cult of personality

00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:20.870
around this guy, Vitalik
Buterin, who's incredibly

00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:23.240
young, I mean, clearly
brilliant, I mean,

00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:26.630
a real genius, but
this really young guy

00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:29.720
who is known as the creator
of it and co-founder of it.

00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:34.070
And "Fortune" actually
perpetrated a hoax on Sunday

00:45:34.070 --> 00:45:36.920
night that Vitalik
Buterin had died.

00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:40.520
And almost instantly, $4
billion were wiped off

00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:43.610
the market cap of ethereum
because (CHUCKLING) people

00:45:43.610 --> 00:45:46.970
said, you know--

00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:49.310
whereas with bitcoin,
the creator--

00:45:49.310 --> 00:45:53.180
this guy whose identity is still
not known, Satoshi Nakamoto--

00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:56.060
after the first couple of
years of working on the system

00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:58.160
alongside other developers
he had recruited,

00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:00.950
he walked away and just
vanished into the night.

00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:03.140
And bitcoin has continued
to thrive after that.

00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:05.840
I think that was one of
the last brilliant things

00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:09.440
he did was that he chose to walk
away from it to see if it could

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:12.680
stand on its own, to not let
it be a cult of personality,

00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:16.670
to not constantly
have people just going

00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:19.400
to him as the Oracle
of Delphi to make

00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:21.660
every decision for them.

00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:24.050
Ethereum still needs to take
those training wheels off,

00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:24.770
in a sense.

00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:27.420
And Vitalik has
said, to his credit,

00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:30.680
that he'd like to take a
step back at some point.

00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:32.430
But that hasn't
really happened yet.

00:46:32.430 --> 00:46:34.688
So--

00:46:34.688 --> 00:46:37.490
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:38.807
AUDIENCE: Hey there.

00:46:38.807 --> 00:46:40.640
First of all, I love
that [? Noval ?] quote.

00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:41.556
So thanks for sharing.

00:46:41.556 --> 00:46:43.400
BRIAN PATRICK EHA: Sure.

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:46.800
AUDIENCE: Hoping you can touch
upon your opinion on, like,

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:49.582
the block-size debate
that's currently going on.

00:46:49.582 --> 00:46:51.290
BRIAN PATRICK EHA:
Yeah, no, I don't have

00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:53.865
a super strong opinion on that.

00:46:53.865 --> 00:46:55.370
I mean, it gets
really technical.

00:46:55.370 --> 00:46:58.310
And there are these
different competing proposals

00:46:58.310 --> 00:47:02.180
for how the network
should be scaled up,

00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:07.292
as I said, to meet the needs
of a growing user base.

00:47:07.292 --> 00:47:09.500
Basically, transactions--
the reason that it's called

00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:13.430
the blockchain network is that
transactions are processed

00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:15.170
and put into blocks--

00:47:15.170 --> 00:47:16.730
these kind of batches.

00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:19.250
And every 10 minutes,
approximately a new block

00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:22.520
is created, and it's added
to the existing blockchain.

00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:25.220
So you have this
immutable ledger

00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:29.730
that records every transaction
going back to January 2009

00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:32.460
in this giant
de-centralized ledger

00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:34.882
that you can think
of as a chain.

00:47:34.882 --> 00:47:36.590
But the problem is
that these blocks only

00:47:36.590 --> 00:47:37.800
have a certain capacity.

00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:40.760
Each block can only hold a
certain number of transactions.

00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:43.966
And as the network has
gotten bigger and bigger,

00:47:43.966 --> 00:47:46.340
as there have been more and
more transactions, whether it

00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:49.980
be spending it as currency,
or trading activity,

00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:53.900
or what have you, those
blocks have been--

00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:56.000
they've gotten full, basically.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.980
And although, as I
said, the transactions

00:47:57.980 --> 00:48:01.280
themselves are still happening
instantaneously, the time

00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:05.210
it's taking for miners
to take new transactions,

00:48:05.210 --> 00:48:07.100
confirm them, verify
that they're valid,

00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:09.020
and thus add them
to new blocks that

00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:12.660
can be added to the overall
blockchain, it's taking longer.

00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:14.409
There's been basically
this slowdown.

00:48:14.409 --> 00:48:15.950
And so there are
different proposals.

00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:17.840
Some people are
saying, well, let's

00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:21.327
make the blocks twice as big
as they currently are, OK?

00:48:21.327 --> 00:48:23.660
Let's make them four times
as big as they currently are.

00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:26.510
Let's do this other thing
and make them twice as

00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:27.825
big as they currently are.

00:48:27.825 --> 00:48:28.950
And there's all this stuff.

00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:31.850
One of the concerns about
making the blocks bigger

00:48:31.850 --> 00:48:33.500
is that then the size--

00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:37.610
I mean, the data storage size
of the overall blockchain--

00:48:37.610 --> 00:48:39.620
will become much, much bigger.

00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:42.530
And it will be much harder
for smaller operators

00:48:42.530 --> 00:48:45.200
to still participate
in the network, which

00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:47.690
could potentially
concentrate power

00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:50.570
in fewer hands on the network.

00:48:50.570 --> 00:48:52.130
I that's one of the concerns.

00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:56.420
And then there are
other concerns,

00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:59.900
if you can call them that, like
the fact that the way right

00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:04.460
now to get the miners to confirm
your transactions faster if you

00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:07.580
really need them to be
confirmed quickly is you

00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:10.970
pay them a little mining
fee, a little transaction fee

00:49:10.970 --> 00:49:12.410
basically.

00:49:12.410 --> 00:49:14.450
Now some people think
this is a real problem.

00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:16.262
We have, over the
last couple of years,

00:49:16.262 --> 00:49:18.220
we're seeing these
transaction fees get higher.

00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:20.450
It used to be that
bitcoin transactions were

00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:21.350
almost costless.

00:49:21.350 --> 00:49:22.850
And that was one
of their advantages

00:49:22.850 --> 00:49:26.540
over things like using
credit cards or other--

00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:28.215
Western Union and so on.

00:49:28.215 --> 00:49:30.590
But if these transaction fees
are going to keep climbing,

00:49:30.590 --> 00:49:33.350
then that seems to
take away at least part

00:49:33.350 --> 00:49:36.380
of bitcoin's advantage, right?

00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:38.030
But on the other
hand, the mining

00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:39.990
pools-- some of the big
mining pools in China,

00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:42.440
for instance-- they seem to
like these transaction fees

00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:45.090
just fine, for obvious reasons.

00:49:45.090 --> 00:49:47.090
And so there is a
bit of a battle.

00:49:47.090 --> 00:49:48.620
I mean, there are
some developers,

00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:51.200
there some bitcoin
companies, other stakeholders

00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:54.340
that have agreed on
certain proposals.

00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:56.840
And then there are others that
are holding out against them.

00:49:56.840 --> 00:50:00.440
And in many cases,
it's the miners.

00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:03.560
And the difficulty there
is that the developers

00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:05.810
can create whatever version
of the software they want.

00:50:05.810 --> 00:50:07.768
They can all agree, this
is what we need to do.

00:50:07.768 --> 00:50:09.680
This is the best
version of the software.

00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:12.650
A lot of the bitcoin
entrepreneurs and companies

00:50:12.650 --> 00:50:15.110
and investors can agree.

00:50:15.110 --> 00:50:18.290
But in order to actually move
to that version of the network,

00:50:18.290 --> 00:50:22.220
you need to get at least 51%
of the total processing power

00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:24.560
on the network to
agree to start running

00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:26.180
that version of the software.

00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:29.090
You need a majority to agree.

00:50:29.090 --> 00:50:34.070
So that has been if you want
to call it holding back some

00:50:34.070 --> 00:50:36.530
of the progress in the network.

00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:38.210
On the other hand,
it's kind of great

00:50:38.210 --> 00:50:40.880
that you have a system that
can't be easily changed, right?

00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:43.400
It's almost like the political
system of the United States,

00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:45.980
that sometimes the
gridlock is not a bug.

00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:48.980
It's a feature because otherwise
each new administration

00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:50.690
that comes in could
just completely

00:50:50.690 --> 00:50:53.960
undo everything and just
wipe the slate clean, right?

00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:58.670
So this is one of the
potential advantages

00:50:58.670 --> 00:51:00.610
of new cryptocurrencies
is that they

00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:01.860
might be a little more nimble.

00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:02.910
They might be more agile.

00:51:02.910 --> 00:51:05.120
They might have better
governance systems

00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:06.320
in some sense.

00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:08.300
But it could be
that bitcoin will

00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:12.380
take on this elder statesman
role, where it, out of all

00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:16.790
these assets, it becomes
the most stable and trusted,

00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:18.860
the one that's least
subject to change.

00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:21.080
And it might turn out
to be a little bit

00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:24.020
of a tortoise compared to
the hare of the others.

00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:25.790
But sometimes you
want a tortoise.

00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:27.025
So--

00:51:27.025 --> 00:51:27.900
SPEAKER 1: All right.

00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:28.870
Well, thank you.

00:51:28.870 --> 00:51:29.000
BRIAN PATRICK EHA: Yeah.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:29.990
SPEAKER 1: So we're
running out of time.

00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:31.760
If you still have questions,
you can meet us over

00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:32.843
by the book-signing table.

00:51:32.843 --> 00:51:34.640
And then we can still
take them over there.

00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:35.720
Thank you so much, Brian.

00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:35.930
BRIAN PATRICK EHA: Sure.

00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:36.970
SPEAKER 1: Thank
you for coming in.

00:51:36.970 --> 00:51:37.570
BRIAN PATRICK EHA: Yeah.

00:51:37.570 --> 00:51:38.470
SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:39.070
BRIAN PATRICK EHA: Thank you.

00:51:39.070 --> 00:51:39.670
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:40.545
SPEAKER 1: All right.

00:51:40.545 --> 00:51:41.470
Great.

00:51:41.470 --> 00:51:43.620
[INAUDIBLE]
