IKY SANDORFY: Hi, everybody.

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.500
My name is Iky, I look
after Google Play business

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.820
development for apps and games.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.830
I'm based in Tel Aviv.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.840
And I look after our business
in Middle East and Africa.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.530
Here today, we have an exciting
panel of really cool panelists

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.120
from game companies
that have all

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.310
had significant launches
in the last year or so.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.120
And we wanted to pick
their brain a little bit

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.750
and learn from your experiences
over the last year on how

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.900
you really took risk
off your game launches

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.520
and improved its
initial performance

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.600
by really developing at
scale, and then launching

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.880
once you're ready, and
finding that right balance

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.740
between a good launch strategy,
a good production cycle.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.950
We figured that developing
and launching games today

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.830
is becoming an increasingly
expensive proposition

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.020
and development costs
have been skyrocketing,

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.000
you need to launch
with a good story line,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.419
with proven mechanics,
with amazing graphics.

00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:58.710
And at the same time, you
need to appeal to an audience

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.670
with a shortening attention
span, increased acquisition

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.670
cost, and real high expectations
for high quality games.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.610
So, all in all, it's
becoming much more

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.380
tricky to launch a hit, and
to launch a success upfront,

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.860
yet there is a couple of
other tools and learnings

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.970
you can really leverage
to understand early

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.300
where your strengths lie
and where to best process

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.749
with the game in order
to ensure the best

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:28.290
possible success
once you're actually

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.890
ready for a global
production launch.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.560
So I'd love to invite
our four distinguished

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.890
panelists from really
cool game companies

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.490
making a diverse range of really
awesome and highly addictive

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.410
games.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.990
Please, join me onstage,
George Abramovici from King;

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.490
Jens Begomann CEO, Wooga;
Saad Choudri, Chief Commercial

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.930
Officer at Miniclip;
and Sergei Zaitsev,

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.690
Business Development
Director, Playrigs.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:09.136
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:02:09.136 --> 00:02:10.094
IKY SANDORFFY: Awesome.

00:02:10.094 --> 00:02:12.570
Thank you so much guys for
joining really excited to have

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.206
you on stage and
just an FYI, I have

00:02:15.206 --> 00:02:17.580
a couple of questions prepared
but please don't hesitate.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.370
We have a couple of minutes at
the end if there's any audience

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.760
questions, just feel free to
shout out or raise your hand,

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.890
we'll try to accommodate
as many as we can.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.000
And we'll have a break later
on, during which you can pick

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.070
this gentleman's brain as well.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.830
Sorry guys, if I kind of
scheduled your breaks now

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.380
already.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.350
Awesome.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.990
Sergei, let's start with you.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.310
All the way to the end.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.480
How are you doing?

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.140
All good?

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.598
SERGEI ZAITSEV:
All good, all good.

00:02:44.598 --> 00:02:48.959
Thank you for hosting us here,
we've got a lot to tell you.

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.000
IKY SANDORFFY: You've had
a massive hit last year

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.820
with "Gardenscapes"
and now create

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.590
a pretty cool
follow-on hit, which

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.280
seems to be breaking
the banks and reaching

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.430
quite a lot of audiences
with "Homeescapes".

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.340
So I wanted to ask
very specifically,

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.390
how and when did you make
that decision to move over

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.100
and to fork off some of
your team's resources

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.620
to start developing a
new title and how did you

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.750
split the resources
between continuing

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.040
to develop for "Gardenscapes"
while also developing

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.550
"Homescapes"?

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.660
SERGEI ZAITSEV: Thank
you for that question.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.600
So Playrix has a long history,
and it was very successful

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.490
in PC-downloadable games.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.150
We had "Gardenscapes"
and the spin off,

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.230
which was around
renovating the house.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.190
It was called Mansion Makeover.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.610
So the spin off in
PC-downloadable world

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.670
was even more successful than
the story about the garden.

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.540
So it was pretty logical
for us to continue the story

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.380
and build a game around--

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.130
when we saw the success
of "Gardenscapes",

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.360
it was very logical
for us to build a game

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.830
around renovating a house.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.660
So we were pretty sure
that the concept will work,

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.610
so that's why we
made the decision.

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:12.330
And talking about resources,
the interesting thing

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.990
that we didn't move anyone from
"Gardenscapes" to "Homescapes"

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.790
and we collected the team behind
"Homescapes" from scratch.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.770
So we were developing the
game for one and a half years,

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.670
and initially it was 10
people just from scratch,

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.350
and then the team rapidly
grew to more than 60 people.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.990
Right now, it's
growing even more.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.490
So yeah.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.030
So we didn't move any
resources, and we just

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.407
seek for top talent, and
we have the knowledge.

00:04:45.407 --> 00:04:47.490
We had a very good experience
with "Gardenscapes".

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.550
And when we were
making "Homescapes",

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.650
we tried to make a game,
which is not a sequel,

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.490
but we wanted to
create a game, which

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.910
was interesting to play and
parallel with "Gardenscapes".

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.140
So we wanted to
change some mechanics,

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.900
but we wanted to stay
in the same universe.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.019
We wanted to expand
the franchise.

00:05:14.019 --> 00:05:16.060
IKY SANDORFFY: So essentially,
you haven't really

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.220
moved anybody from
one title to the other

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.180
in terms of resourcing.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.397
You really have staffed
an entirely new team.

00:05:21.397 --> 00:05:22.230
SERGEI ZAITSEV: Yes.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.780
Sure.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.510
Of course, there was a
lot of shared knowledge

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.700
from "Gardenscapes" team
to "Homescapes" team,

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.630
but in terms of resources,
we didn't move artists, game

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.655
designers, and a lot of guys.

00:05:33.655 --> 00:05:34.780
IKY SANDORFFY: Really cool.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.500
Are these two teams competing
now internally as well?

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.230
SERGEI ZAITSEV: I would
call it like a corporation.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.930
IKY SANDORFFY: It's a fair.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.980
So I just wanted to bring
this up in terms of retention.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.650
We discussed earlier
that retentions

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.100
seems to be becoming more and
more important as a true KPI

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.600
of business success.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.930
And with "8 Ball
Pool," you really

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.180
have created a title that
retains for quite some time.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.380
So I wanted to ask a bit about
the secret sauce behind it

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.680
and kind of what you can
share, obviously, in this forum

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.912
that we can learn from, and
creating such a title that

00:06:11.912 --> 00:06:13.120
retains for such a long time.

00:06:15.435 --> 00:06:16.810
SAAD CHOUDRI: We
won't be sharing

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.220
ingredients, Iky, for souce.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:24.520
No, we've been
going for five years

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.100
now, over five years it's
been out on the mobile,

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.690
and it lived on the web as well.

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:33.110
So, much like Playrix, we
started our life on the web.

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.350
It's very easy for
us to understand

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:39.502
that there would be a player
reaction towards this game.

00:06:39.502 --> 00:06:42.250
So what we've seen
in terms of retention

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.570
is "8 Ball Pool" has
become almost a utility

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:47.870
for a lot of people.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:54.100
It's a way for people to play
a competitive game on mobile.

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.050
Sometimes the traditional
retention for us

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:03.065
is not something
that we 100% always

00:07:03.065 --> 00:07:05.950
are going to be
worried about too much

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:07.970
because, actually,
the way they are

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:12.430
is that maybe they go
away for about two months,

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.300
and they haven't
played the game.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.291
But then eventually they'll come
back again and then fall back

00:07:17.291 --> 00:07:19.540
into a pattern of playing
for like two or three weeks.

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:20.410
IKY SANDORFFY: Yeah.

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:21.010
Just a second.

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:22.310
Can everybody hear us OK?

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:23.840
Because I noticed
there was some--

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:24.340
No?

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:25.180
OK, got it.

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.720
SAAD CHOUDRI: It was
genius stuff, guys.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.160
It was genius stuff.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.070
I'll tell you what, I
did like five points,

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:32.720
on your D-30 retention.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.882
It's unfortunate
for the front row.

00:07:34.882 --> 00:07:36.340
SERGEI ZAITSEV: I
can confirm that.

00:07:39.399 --> 00:07:40.440
IKY SANDORFFY: Very cool.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:45.100
So we'll try to reiterate
some of the points that

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.470
were lost in translation here.

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:50.430
But-- ah, perfect.

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:53.200
SAAD CHOUDRI: Maybe not a vote.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.850
IKY SANDORFFY: Maybe you
would like to reiterate.

00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:58.320
No, Saad.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.300
Just to repeat just
the highlights.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.200
SAAD CHOUDRI: So,
basically just to repeat,

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.660
from a high level perspective,
we look at retention,

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.500
but "8 Ball Pool" had
been living so long

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.340
on many people's devices.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.730
The way we reengage
players, and really,

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:15.910
we feel like it's more of
a utility now for people.

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:17.992
They come back and
they play this.

00:08:17.992 --> 00:08:20.200
Even if they may have lacked
for two or three months,

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:24.980
they will come back and then
play for their regular session

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.670
lengths that we would expect
to see when they first started.

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:33.400
So we really spend a lot of time
on that aspect of our launch

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:37.205
strategy, and relaunching
games sometimes as well.

00:08:37.205 --> 00:08:39.080
IKY SANDORFFY: Running
"8 Ball" as a utility.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.330
SAAD CHOUDRI: Yes, sir.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.194
Everybody plays pool, right?

00:08:42.194 --> 00:08:43.360
SERGEI ZAITSEV: I know I do.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.760
I can't judge from anybody
else, but I'm hooked.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.780
And I have been for
quite some time.

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:51.710
So it's pretty
tricky to get off.

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:54.760
IKY SANDORFFY: Jens, you've
just launched "June's Journey"

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.400
with a really massive
launch, congratulations

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.420
on this first of all.

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:00.700
Yeah, it looks really amazing.

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.100
When we talked, you
mentioned that you've

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:06.850
created a really long production
cycle with a pretty long road

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:09.750
map of content updates,
life ops, and activities

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.250
that you're doing
in order to reduce

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:12.458
that original risk at launch.

00:09:12.458 --> 00:09:14.492
I wanted to ask a
little bit about that.

00:09:14.492 --> 00:09:16.075
JENS BEGEMANN: Yes
so "June's Journey"

00:09:16.075 --> 00:09:20.500
is our latest hidden object
game, came out two weeks ago.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:24.280
And there was really two
phases during the soft launch.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.280
The first phase was OK, does
this have the retention metrics

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.400
that we need to have a
successful game long term?

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.421
That was something we looked
at between January and April.

00:09:33.421 --> 00:09:35.420
And because we had a
previous hidden object game

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.030
before that was
a big success, we

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:40.070
could compare apples to
apples and we saw very early,

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:41.570
OK this will work.

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:42.890
Retention is good.

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:45.790
But then we had another six
month period, from April

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:49.900
to October, where it was really
about de-risking the launch

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:53.000
because life operations and
content are so critical.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.500
So it's our highest
production value game ever.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.960
It's our biggest content
effort game ever.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.290
It's pretty ridiculous.

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:03.660
So we release a new
chapter every single week,

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:04.820
every Friday.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:09.270
And every chapter is
1600 man hours of work.

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:11.150
So every Friday,
there's basically

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:14.030
a chapter that would
take 40 people 40 hours

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:17.080
a week to produce
every single Friday.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.310
With people internally,
with outsourcing,

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:23.540
and it's ridiculous, but
we think it will work.

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.080
The first two weeks of data
indicate that this will work.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.600
Our previous hidden object game
indicates that that will work.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.910
We really needed
the preparation time

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:34.370
because we have an
author team, a writing

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:36.020
team of three authors.

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:37.786
They write about
a year in advance.

00:10:37.786 --> 00:10:39.410
So they are currently
writing the story

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:42.490
that will appear in the game
in one year, next October.

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:44.540
There's graphic production
in between, etc.

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:48.680
So what we really did is we went
to the UK and we did something

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.270
we called dress rehearsal.

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:53.390
So we pretended we were live.

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:55.760
So we had weekly
content releases,

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.980
we had our weekly
reviews on marketing

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:00.740
spend, we did social
media, customer care.

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:02.810
We did everything as if
we were live globally,

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:06.320
just limited to the UK,
across all platforms.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.639
And we didn't do that to
evaluate if the game would work

00:11:09.639 --> 00:11:11.930
from a retention perspective--
we had already done that

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:12.870
before--

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:15.650
but to practice if we
could run life operations,

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:17.480
if we could run
content production,

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:20.940
if we could run localization
and all of those things.

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:22.980
And yeah, that was
really the key.

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:24.310
But it's a huge bet.

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:28.297
It seems to pay off, but I
had some sleepless nights.

00:11:28.297 --> 00:11:29.630
IKY SANDORFFY: I cannot imagine.

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:33.500
So at what stage then during
that dress rehearsal did you

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:34.929
make that go or no go decision?

00:11:34.929 --> 00:11:37.220
Was that like a set threshold
that you had set up front

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:38.220
or was it mostly--

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:39.900
JENS BEGEMANN: So
yeah, we already made

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:43.070
the "we will launch"
decision in April.

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:45.850
In April, we said we will
launch on October 5th.

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:49.010
Half a year in advance, we
set a specific launch date,

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:51.050
and we worked
backwards from that.

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:53.480
And we would have only
diverted from this

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.640
if we would have seen
something unexpected.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.730
So we really used that
half a year to see,

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:00.740
is there something
unexpected coming?

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:03.020
To have those dozens of
people who are involved,

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.930
to basically prepare them,
and train them and get them

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:09.680
into the rhythm of what it
means to run a game with life

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.810
operations and content.

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:14.360
The five years after launch
is so much more important

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.940
now than the two years before.

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:19.370
And that's what we basically
prepared for in the last half

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:19.970
a year.

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:21.803
IKY SANDORFFY: That
said, you often optimize

00:12:21.803 --> 00:12:24.266
during that period for
long term retention?

00:12:24.266 --> 00:12:26.390
JENS BEGEMANN: We optimize
for long term retention.

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:28.580
I mean, one sentence
I say is, OK

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:30.410
you will lose a certain
amount of people

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:31.460
during your first week.

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:32.834
They may not like
the theme, they

00:12:32.834 --> 00:12:34.640
may not like the
genre, but those

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.400
who are still with you
after a week you really want

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.164
to keep in the long run.

00:12:39.164 --> 00:12:40.580
You really still
want to have them

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:43.050
after you that was the
mindset on content production.

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:45.470
IKY SANDORFFY: So from day
seven to day 28 retention,

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:47.660
you expect a minimal drop
off in order to justify.

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.910
JENS BEGEMANN: Actually,
with our hidden object games,

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:53.720
we've now changed, our reporting
system to measure day 720

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.772
retention because these
games are really about--

00:12:55.772 --> 00:12:56.730
IKY SANDORFFY: Day 720?

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:58.354
JENS BEGEMANN: Yes,
two-year retention.

00:12:58.354 --> 00:13:01.060
So we measure two-year
retention for cohorts

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:03.839
because long term retention
is everything for these games.

00:13:03.839 --> 00:13:05.630
IKY SANDORFFY: That's
a good segue actually

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:08.390
to move on to George.

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:10.250
You've been running
your hit games

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:12.350
for the last couple
of years with King,

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:16.010
running the now very
famous "Candy Crush

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:18.570
Saga" and the entire franchise.

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:22.430
I had figured you also optimize
for the long term retention.

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:26.330
I'm wondering how you guys make
the decision between launching

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:28.970
a new franchise, to launching
a content update on one

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:30.410
of your existing titles.

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:31.760
GEORGE ABRAMOVICI: OK.

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:35.600
Basically, we had to
think about this strategy

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.510
around a few years ago when we
realized that "Candy Crush" is

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:41.690
here to stay for a long time.

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:44.400
We decided to build
two parallel tracks,

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.940
and one is keep working
on "Candy Crush"

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:48.720
and improve the game
and keep it fresh.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.000
We are adding new
levels, updating

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.120
big extensions and new
content every second week.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:59.450
Then, we also say we need
to also do something else,

00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:01.050
so we followed this same--

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:02.240
these two tracks.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.250
Investing in existing
games and also

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:06.500
working on launching new ones--

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:09.690
can be sister titles or can be
sequels to the original one.

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:11.409
But also new IPs as well.

00:14:11.409 --> 00:14:13.200
IKY SANDORFFY: When
you do launch a sequel,

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.330
do you prefer--

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.180
essentially, are you taking
existing game teams or existing

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:19.940
stuff from the game teams in
order to develop that sequel,

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:22.820
or an extra dimension
where you actually

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.840
hired a completely
separate team to continue?

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.090
GEORGE ABRAMOVICI: It's a mix.

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:28.700
We also learned we need to use
the expertise from the people

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:30.380
that worked on previous games.

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:33.230
Some of them already know
how to build certain stuff,

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:35.050
and they're needed
in the new team,

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:39.170
but we also have
new things as well.

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:40.810
IKY SANDORFFY: Pretty cool.

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:43.850
It's working, clearly.

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:47.660
Definitely something
we can learn from.

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:52.010
Back to you, Jens, actually,
I wanted to ask specifically

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.740
about the inverse
of "June's Journey,"

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:57.260
of what we've just discussed,
of an experience you've

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.630
had as developing a game with
a relatively long schedule

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:03.652
and production cycle,
and where you ended up

00:15:03.652 --> 00:15:05.610
with a decision of saying
this is not worth it.

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:08.220
We should actually roll back and
change, and move the research

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:10.320
to something else.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.880
Deciding to kill
or roll back here.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:15.030
JENS BEGEMANN: Yeah, we question
our productions all the time

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:17.410
and we actually stop
games at different stages.

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:20.970
So just a couple of days
ago, we stopped a project

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:23.790
that was already full
scale into production,

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:26.040
over 20 people team,
but it was still

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.860
over a year away from launch.

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:33.090
We saw too many risks
and in the end decided,

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:35.280
OK we'll stop this.

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:38.130
Not everything was shaping up
to give a very clear picture

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:40.770
of "this will be awesome"
because just good is not enough

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:41.340
anymore.

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:42.930
On this market,
you have to be one

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:46.290
of the best or maybe the best
in your genre to have a chance.

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:49.770
So that was really based
on relatively early stage,

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:54.350
and based on play tests
and subjective evaluation.

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:57.660
But we also stopped a project
in May that was in soft launch,

00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:59.910
based on retention metrics.

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:01.690
Day one day three
retention was good

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:06.390
but then day seven, the drop
off of retention was too strong.

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:09.810
We just stopped that in
relatively early stages

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:10.560
of soft launch.

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.720
IKY SANDORFFY: So those were two
separate cycles, if you will.

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:13.970
One subjective playtest.

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:16.620
JENS BEGEMANN: One very
subjective playtest,

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:18.390
over a year away from launch.

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:21.660
The second one was after a
couple of months of soft launch

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:22.974
based on metrics.

00:16:22.974 --> 00:16:25.140
IKY SANDORFFY: So, even
after the subjective measure

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:27.620
that we figured out it might
not hold up, the quality,

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:28.580
you still went--

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:30.330
JENS BEGEMANN: This
market is super tough,

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:34.030
I don't meet any developer
who says it's easy.

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:35.470
I never meet them.

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:37.000
So it's super, super tough.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.750
You have to be one of the
best, and therefore the bar

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:44.280
is crazy high, and you
have to be quite ruthless.

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:46.470
Only if you're completely
convinced that this will

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:49.020
be great, you should continue.

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:51.390
If it's, oh, this is pretty
good, that's not enough.

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:52.830
That's not acceptable.

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:54.780
SAAD CHOUDRI: Can
I ask a question?

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:58.280
Because it's probably more
relevant for the room,

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:01.080
but everyone talks about
the retention metrics.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.130
What is your bar?

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:04.500
You said you guys set
a bar, what's your bar?

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:07.510
Above the 40, 20, 10, what
are you guys looking at?

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:11.339
JENS BEGEMANN: What we do
is we look at days played.

00:17:11.339 --> 00:17:14.280
For every install, how
many days on average

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.117
does that person
play over the year?

00:17:16.117 --> 00:17:16.950
SAAD CHOUDRI: Right.

00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:19.020
JENS BEGEMANN:
Over the next year.

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:22.109
That number can be high because
long-term retention is amazing,

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:24.119
or that number can be
high because everybody

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:27.359
plays for the first few
weeks and then drops off.

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:31.290
There, something in the ballpark
of days played of 30 to 40

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:32.580
is good.

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:35.280
You have 100 installs
and then on average they

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.440
play 30 or 40 days
during the year.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:39.420
But obviously, monetization
is also important.

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.045
SAAD CHOUDRI: That's
30 to 40 sessions.

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:44.452
Separate days.

00:17:44.452 --> 00:17:46.410
JENS BEGEMANN: Obviously,
out of those hundreds

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:49.500
installs, most of them play one.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.800
Because if you have
50% day one retention,

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.190
that's already cutting.

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:56.910
Yeah that's the way
we look at it now,

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.140
because we think numbers.

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:00.990
Like, hey, day 30 retention
needs to be about 15%,

00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:07.020
or day 30 retention needs to
be 20%, it's just one number.

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:09.294
You look at the
whole dropoff rate.

00:18:09.294 --> 00:18:10.960
SAAD CHOUDRI: You use
the amount of days

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.960
that people play to figure
out your calculation.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.840
OK, I think that a lot of
people are moving towards that.

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:19.060
JENS BEGEMANN: We making
LTV predictions, basically.

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:22.260
SAAD CHOUDRI: Yeah, that's
what I hope many people do.

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.840
JENS BEGEMANN: No, you have to
predict LTV during soft launch

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:25.881
and see where it ends up.

00:18:25.881 --> 00:18:29.370
IKY SANDORFFY: That actually
brings up a really good point,

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:34.740
Saad, and specifically to you
and the recent launch of "War

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:38.790
Wings" and now just a little
bit surprised that we're almost

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:39.880
running out of time.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.570
But just to quickly just talk
about the "War Wings" launch

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:44.570
because you really have
done something different

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:45.870
from your recent launches.

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:49.080
SAAD CHOUDRI: Yeah, we
went a little bit outside

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:52.500
of what people perceive as
our traditional comfort zone,

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:58.080
where we really launched a
fully 3D dog fighting game.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:01.705
We, like Jens, talked
about the dress rehearsal

00:19:01.705 --> 00:19:04.080
in one territory, so we had
already done the soft launch,

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.540
and then we essentially
focused on doing

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:12.510
a full, almost global
launch-esque campaign in one

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:13.090
territory.

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:14.400
We did that in the UK.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:18.990
We did your full UA that
you would do, we did TV,

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:22.320
we did cinema, we
did a lot of things.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:25.740
We worked with the platforms who
supported us on this endeavor

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:29.640
to try and see
what that would do.

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:34.650
Soft launch can give you a false
sense of security sometimes.

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:37.440
I think a lot of people, and
a lot of product managers,

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:41.730
and a lot og UA
teams will almost

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:43.664
do too well in soft
launch because they'll

00:19:43.664 --> 00:19:45.330
have targeted the
users that they really

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:47.160
want and the metrics
start looking good.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.580
Then you wonder why they haven't
scaled when you go into global.

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:53.884
They'll be like oh,
it's the featuring.

00:19:53.884 --> 00:19:55.800
You get loads of these
casual audiences, guys.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:59.244
I know you guys hear it, we
might as well talk about it.

00:19:59.244 --> 00:20:00.910
So why we did that
is just to really get

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:04.870
a good sense of what that
would do on a global stage.

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:07.930
It's proven to be
successful, because it

00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:09.914
replicated onto the
global launch, when

00:20:09.914 --> 00:20:10.830
we pushed it out live.

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:12.040
IKY SANDORFFY: Would that
work for "Homescapes"?

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:14.440
Or would that have been a
good strategy for "Homescapes"

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.160
as well?

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.710
Doubling down on one
country and going all in,

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:19.840
or do you rather go
for a global launch

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:22.570
and then really see down the
line where you need to focus?

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:24.111
SERGEI ZAITSEV: It's
a good question.

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:28.434
We think that the
definition of a soft launch

00:20:28.434 --> 00:20:30.350
should be different,
dependent on the context.

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:33.280
So if you go to the very
competitive crowded space

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:37.750
like mystery genre,
then then it should

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:42.700
release on the soft launch very
highly polished product, which

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:45.887
is pretty ready for
the commercial launch.

00:20:45.887 --> 00:20:47.470
If you are missing
any of the features

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:49.540
that other competitors
have in the market,

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.630
then we will not make it.

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:54.040
You will not make it.

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:57.490
On the soft launch, we don't
test any mechanics or concepts.

00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:01.900
We already are sure that
the game is in good shape.

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:07.300
But what they're testing is
retentions, monetization,

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:10.510
technical side, that
nothing crashes.

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:15.460
And then we also test
the difficulty curve,

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:20.950
which is gender equality.

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:26.050
We soft launch in Canada,
usually, and Australia.

00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:28.930
We believe that
these metrics are

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:30.840
pretty reliable for
the commercial launch.

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:38.600
The period for which we soft
launch, it depends on the game.

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:44.660
And for "Gardenscapes," we soft
launched it for several months.

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:48.560
And "Homescapes", we kept it
in soft launch for one month.

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:55.230
We can rely on these numbers.

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:56.880
IKY SANDORFFY: But
it clearly worked.

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.640
All of you guys have been
really successful in launching

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:00.610
these games this year.

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:03.210
So we've taken a lot of
learnings from you guys

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:05.140
and really want to
share as much as we can.

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:07.140
I'm really afraid that
we're running out of time

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:08.910
and I think I have
to cut this short.

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:11.550
Although I think I could stay
here for the entire afternoon.

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:13.070
Do we have time for
questions still?

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.980
OK, cool.

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:16.440
If somebody here in the
audience has questions, please

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:18.390
raise your hand now.

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:20.770
It's a good time.

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:22.020
We have a couple more minutes.

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:26.120
OK, right here.

00:22:28.754 --> 00:22:29.420
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:30.920
Hi.

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:33.770
It's a question for
Jens and Saad as well.

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:37.100
You both mentioned
you did a soft launch

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:39.560
and a real global
launch in the UK.

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:41.430
JENS BEGEMANN: We called
it dress rehearsal.

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:43.779
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:22:43.779 --> 00:22:44.570
What did you learn?

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:45.590
SAAD CHOUDRI: You
need a better name.

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:47.476
JENS BEGEMANN: Yeah,
what did you call it?

00:22:47.476 --> 00:22:48.850
SAAD CHOUDRI: Soft
global launch.

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:50.600
JENS BEGEMANN: Soft
global launch is not--

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.058
SAAD CHOUDRI:
Somebody in this room

00:22:52.058 --> 00:22:53.540
will come up with a better idea.

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:55.450
JENS BEGEMANN: Sorry
we interrupted you.

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:57.390
AUDIENCE: I was just
curious of what learnings

00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:58.940
did you get from that?

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:02.660
You did the rehearsal and
then you presented with it.

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:04.340
Saad, you did all
your campaigns,

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:06.680
and did you learn
anything from it?

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:10.519
Did that affect the way you ran
the global launch after that?

00:23:10.519 --> 00:23:11.810
SAAD CHOUDRI: Yeah, absolutely.

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:14.000
That's why you do it right.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.180
Some of the channels in which
we had spent some marketing

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:23.510
dollars, we scaled that back,
other ones we put more into it.

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:28.700
For us, it was a new type of
genre for us to enter into.

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:31.190
We just really wanted
to make sure that one,

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:35.210
did our own network respond
to that kind of game?

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:37.200
What kind of UA channels?

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.560
Does brand marketing
campaigns work for this?

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:41.540
That's what we got from that.

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:44.180
We took that data back
and then rearranged

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:47.120
what we did for global launch.

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:51.154
We wouldn't have got that had we
not done that kind of process.

00:23:51.154 --> 00:23:52.820
JENS BEGEMANN: I agree
to what you said.

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:54.560
For us, it was,
also, in addition

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:57.530
to this, because it was our
next big hidden object game

00:23:57.530 --> 00:24:01.760
and we've got an
extremely loyal fan base.

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:04.161
We knew our best
users, our VIPs,

00:24:04.161 --> 00:24:05.660
from our previous
hidden object game

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:07.850
would play "June's
Journey" on day one.

00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:09.560
They need to have
a great experience.

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:12.210
Therefore, things like this
weekly content production,

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:13.400
which is crazy.

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.680
Every Friday releasing
a new chapter.

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.540
We wanted to have
practice in that.

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:21.440
We wanted to have practice in
a real market, with real users,

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.990
and with real customer care,
and with real social media

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:27.440
interaction, and with
real weekly pressure,

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.600
basically, on the
team, to, yes, this

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:33.380
has to be out, to see if
it really, really works

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:35.925
or if we would break
everything when we go global.

00:24:35.925 --> 00:24:38.300
That, in addition to what you
said on the marketing side,

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:39.200
was important to us.

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:40.866
SAAD CHOUDRI: The
other thing we learned

00:24:40.866 --> 00:24:43.970
was we launched tha
game, which is probably

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:47.030
sacrilege to say in here,
but the initial binary

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:49.449
download was 1.6 gigabytes.

00:24:49.449 --> 00:24:51.740
So we needed to make sure
that we can do that globally.

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:53.720
In the UK, it works.

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:57.410
That was a big thing
for us to test as well.

00:24:57.410 --> 00:24:58.940
IKY SANDORFFY: Nice.

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:01.820
We have time for one
more quick question.

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:02.990
First come, first served.

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:10.540
Let me summarize with one
quick question of my own,

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:11.590
the last one.

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:13.100
Just a flash question.

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:15.530
If there is one thing that
you would want this room

00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:18.650
to take away, what's the
one KPI or the one tool

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:22.130
that the audience
should be considering

00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:23.570
when launching a new title.

00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:26.570
What's that key KPI
you're looking at?

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:27.320
George?

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.945
GEORGE ABRAMOVICI: For us, that
always has been and always will

00:25:29.945 --> 00:25:34.260
be engagement, as well
as retention rates.

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:38.540
Understand why players
play your game, why

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:41.260
players don't like your game.

00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:44.510
That's key to further
grow your game as well.

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:48.020
You need to know exactly
what are the pain points

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:52.340
and fix them as
soon as possible.

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:54.330
Very important for
launch, I would

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:58.610
say it's have enough content
for the most engaged players,

00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:00.410
like you were saying, as well.

00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:03.099
Don't underestimate that.

00:26:03.099 --> 00:26:05.390
Just make sure that there's
enough content for the most

00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:06.950
engaged players out there.

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:08.330
They can be very
vocal afterwards

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:09.869
if they run out of it, so--

00:26:09.869 --> 00:26:12.160
IKY SANDORFFY: You don't want
to get your highest value

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.130
gamers getting
disappointed very quickly

00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:15.660
and having finished
the game early.

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:17.560
GEORGE ABRAMOVICI: Absolutely

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:18.670
IKY SANDORFFY: I've been
affected with that myself

00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:19.370
sometimes.

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:23.864
Having reached the end
of the game too quickly.

00:26:23.864 --> 00:26:25.280
JENS BEGEMANN: In
addition to what

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.847
you said, George, on
retention during soft launch.

00:26:27.847 --> 00:26:29.930
I think it's really when
you're super early stage,

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:33.710
or early stage, and you're
doing your play testing,

00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:34.937
see excitement.

00:26:34.937 --> 00:26:36.770
If you don't see
excitement among your team,

00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:40.074
among people who play
it, very bad sign.

00:26:40.074 --> 00:26:41.490
IKY SANDORFFY:
That's a good cure.

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:42.020
Saad.

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:44.030
SAAD CHOUDRI: For us,
long term retention

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:45.821
is probably the most
important thing for us

00:26:45.821 --> 00:26:46.910
to look at and for.

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:50.750
The one issue that--

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:52.400
we've discussed this
in this industry

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:57.170
is funny, because 15%
D30, that is very good.

00:26:57.170 --> 00:26:58.880
Or 10% D30 would be good.

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:01.400
That's kind of crazy to
think about your game started

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:05.330
with 100 users and
now you've got 10.

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:08.960
As an industry,
and as game makers,

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.550
and as content
developers, we're going

00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:12.760
to need to improve
that in the future.

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:16.250
That ought to be very difficult
to have viable business going

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:17.851
down that route.

00:27:17.851 --> 00:27:18.850
SERGEI ZAITSEV: I agree.

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:23.690
If it was only one advice,
just to focus a lot.

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:28.920
Focus a lot on the product and
focus only on critical things.

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.450
When you soft
launch a game, there

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:34.340
should be only a small list
of most critical things

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:36.320
that you should focus on.

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:40.880
You should ruthlessly drop
everything not important

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.620
and focus only on
important things.

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:49.280
What's important is always
dependent on the game,

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:50.140
on the context.

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:55.430
If you have a game with amazing
graphics, and the graphics

00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:56.860
are the most important feature.

00:27:56.860 --> 00:28:00.620
So you should make
sure that this is core

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:02.870
and you should polish it a lot.

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:07.230
You should care less about
leagues or clans for fair game.

00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:10.940
But if it's a DVD
PUP game, then you

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:14.180
should make sure that
PUP is pretty polished

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:19.280
and graphic is less important.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.960
This is Playrix's way.

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:21.800
We focus a lot.

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:24.710
We don't do many games.

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:27.200
For us, you will
see good results.

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.340
So I advise you to try it too.

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:34.070
IKY SANDORFFY: Content,
focus, retention.

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:37.310
That's essentially
the key summary points

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:39.320
that I'm getting out of here.

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.240
Gentlemen, thank you
so much for coming up

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:43.910
on stage and for agreeing to
share with the wider team.

00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:50.105
I invite you all to come and
find our panelists afterwards

00:28:50.105 --> 00:28:52.130
at the break if you
want to pick their brain

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:55.310
and get some more
specific advice.

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:59.450
I wish you a very successful
and valuable rest of the day.

00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:01.480
Thank you very much.
