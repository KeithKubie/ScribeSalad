00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.470
Our sense of smell plays a huge role in our
sense of taste; the sensation of flavour is

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.240
actually a combination of both these senses.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.160
But there's also a link between our sense
of smell and obesity, according to a new study.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.410
It’s a lot more complicated than eating
more when food smells amazing.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.840
Turns out savouring the aroma of your food
could be adding inches to your waistline.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.840
The research was done using mice, not humans,
but it still applies to us.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.670
Using gene therapy, the team temporarily destroyed
olfactory neurons in the noses of adult mice,

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.730
leaving them without a sense of smell.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.780
Another group of mice was left with their
sense of smell intact.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.790
The two groups were then fed the same high-fat
diet.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.000
The mice without a sense of smell stayed trim,
gaining no more than 10 percent of their body

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
weight.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Some heavier mice actually lost weight with
their sense of smell gone.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.219
And it was all fat loss — there was no effect
on the mass of their muscles, bone density,

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:46.370
or organs.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.980
The mice whose sense of smell was left intact,
on the other hand, just about doubled in size.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.640
This US-based team compared notes with another
team in Germany researching with supersmellers

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.480
— mice with acute olfactory nerves.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.920
These mice gained even more weight on a standard
diet than normal mice.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.080
The researchers found the smell-deficient
mice regulated their sympathetic nervous system

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.750
to burn more calories.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.940
They were able to turn their subcutaneous
fat storage cells into brown fat cells, the

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.780
good ones that burn fatty acids to produce
heat.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.190
Some actually turned almost all their subcutaneous
fat into brown fat, making them super lean.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.729
The fat mice among the smell-less group also
regained normal glucose tolerance, taking

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.159
them back from the precipice of diabetes.

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.869
The negative effect was an increase of noradrenaline,
a stress hormone whose release is also tied

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.450
to the sympathetic nervous system.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.920
In humans, too much of this hormone can lead
to heart attacks.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.120
Odor and olfactory sensations, it turns out,
do more than make food taste better.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.840
At least, in mice.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.180
Smell mechanisms affect the way the body deals
with calories.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.270
Weight gain is more than high caloric intake,
it’s also about how the body perceives and

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.220
deals with the calories.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.880
Without being able to smell it, your body
is more likely to burn the calories than store

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.360
them, suggesting a firm link between the olfactory
system and the regions in the brain that control

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.360
metabolism.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.100
It’s also possible that the lack of being
able to smell tricks the body into thinking

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.719
it’s not hungry so fat stored while hunting
for food is burned as soon as the body is

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:10.719
fed.

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:13.700
The specifics of the neural circuits involved
with this aren’t well known just yet, but

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.340
the link is there for further study.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.419
Again, this result comes from a trial done
with mice in a lab, but it’s also one of

00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:23.809
the first really in-depth studies into how
we can manipulate olfactory inputs and brain

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:27.500
circuitry to affect energy balance, and there
will certainly be more.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.629
If scientists find a way to replicate this
result in humans and develop a drug that blocks

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:35.690
the metabolic circuitry without damaging the
sense of smell, it could be a game changer

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.269
in the fight against rising obesity rates.

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.079

Speaking of appetizing, our early ancestors
resorted to cannibalism.

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:03.790
Can’t imagine that’d smell too good…
