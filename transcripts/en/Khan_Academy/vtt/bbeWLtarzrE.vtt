00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:01.960
In the last video,
we figured out

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.710
how to figured out the sum
of the roots of a polynomial.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.960
What we're going to try to
attempt to do in this video

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.660
is think about the
sum of the squares

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.690
of the roots of a polynomial.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.390
So let's think about
that a little bit.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.180
So let's say that I
have a second degree

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.090
polynomial that looks like this.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:28.170
So it's x squared plus a1x,
plus a2 and this is equal to 0.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.890
We saw-- and actually,
I'll just redo

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.473
some of what we did
in the last video,

00:00:31.473 --> 00:00:33.370
because it's going to
be useful over here.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.076
This thing is going to
have two roots, r1 and r2.

00:00:37.076 --> 00:00:40.080
Two roots, and that tells
us that this thing can

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:47.130
be rewritten as x minus r1,
times x minus r2 is equal to 0.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.930
And if you expand
this out, you get

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:58.860
x squared minus r1
plus r2, x, plus r1r2.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.567
So that's what you
get right over there.

00:01:00.567 --> 00:01:01.650
Now, let's think about it.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:09.160
We figured out from the last
video that r1 plus r2, which

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.930
is right over here,
that needs to be

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.250
equal to the negative
of this coefficient.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.460
This a1 over here is equal to
the negative of r1 plus r2.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.720
So r1 plus r2 is equal
to the negative of a1.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.660
So let's see if we can use that
information, right over there,

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.250
to figure out what-- let
me do this in a new color--

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.412
to figure out what r1
squared plus r2 squared is.

00:01:34.412 --> 00:01:35.870
So let's see how
we could get that.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.390
Well, one place that we
could start off with,

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.005
we could start off with
r1 plus r2 squared.

00:01:42.005 --> 00:01:46.960
So r1 plus r2 squared, which
is, of course, the same thing

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.350
as negative a1 squared, which
would be the same thing as a1

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.450
squared.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.250
a1 squared-- I could
put a negative here,

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.070
but a negative 1
times negative 1

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.350
is obviously a
positive one-- this

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.780
is going to be
equal to r1 squared

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.030
plus 2r1r2, plus r2 squared.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.960
So this has the sum that
we care about in it.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.820
Let's call this
sum 1-- we're just

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.330
raising the roots
to the first power.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.550
Let's call this sum 2.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.160
So this over here, we've
written, essentially,

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.940
that sum 1 squared--
that's sum s

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.670
sub 1 squared is equal
to-- this plus this

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.140
is s sub 2-- is equal
to s sub 2 plus 2r1r2.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.180
Now, can we figure
out what r1r2 is

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.789
based on looking at the
actual original polynomial?

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:52.330
Well, you look over
here, if you just

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.090
did an expansion--
of course, I forgot

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.810
to write here that this is
equal to 0-- r1r2 is essentially

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.790
represented by a2 over here.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.910
So to take the first degree
sum, or the roots raised

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.330
to the first power sum, we
looked at this coefficient.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.970
Now all of a sudden, we're
involving the coefficient

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:12.845
to the right of that.

00:03:12.845 --> 00:03:16.710
We're going two degrees below
the degree of the polynomial.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.510
So this, right over here, is a2.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.510
So r1r2 is a2.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:23.710
That's a2.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.470
This right here-- this whole
expression-- is a1 squared.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.100
So if we want to
solve for this sum--

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.220
if we want to solve
for s sub 2, we

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.020
would get s sub 2 is equal
to a1 squared-- that's

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:45.540
this over here--
minus 2 times a sub 2.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.150
So we just figured
out a fast way

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.920
to figure out the sum of the
squares of the root of just

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.720
a second degree
quadratic right now.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.020
So for example,
if I were to give

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.790
you-- let me give you
something strange.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:09.310
So if I were to give you 7x
squared minus pi x, plus e

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.360
is equal to 0.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.130
And someone said, I
want you to figure out

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.200
the sum of the squares of
the roots of this polynomial,

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.160
first you want to
make the coefficient

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.230
in front of the x squared 1.

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.610
So divide everything by 7.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:31.126
So you get x squared minus
pi over 7 x, plus e over 7

00:04:31.126 --> 00:04:32.794
is equal to 0.

00:04:32.794 --> 00:04:35.210
And then you could just use
the result that we just found.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.581
The sum of the square of the
roots-- is this s2 over here.

00:04:38.581 --> 00:04:40.580
Whatever the roots are,
you square each of them,

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.020
you take their
sum, and it's going

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.750
to be equal to a1 squared.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.100
So it's going to be
pi squared over 49.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.494
I'm just squaring
this right over here,

00:04:49.494 --> 00:04:50.660
or I could just square that.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.576
The negative doesn't
matter what I'm squaring.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.339
minus 2 times e over seven.

00:04:59.339 --> 00:05:00.880
And that's about as
simplified as you

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.100
could get this expression.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.020
So it's pi squared over
49, minus 2 e over 7,

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.000
which by itself a
pretty neat result.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.437
Because it would be very hard
to find the roots of this.

00:05:09.437 --> 00:05:11.270
You'd get some crazy
numbers, and then you'd

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.644
have to square
them and sum them.

00:05:12.644 --> 00:05:14.915
But we just figured out a
very fast way of doing it.

00:05:14.915 --> 00:05:17.290
Now, let's see if we can extend
this to the third degree.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:18.410
And it actually
turns out you can--

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.410
not only to the third
degree you can extend this

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:21.180
to the nth degree.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.370
And I might do an induction
proof it gets a little bit

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.650
messier than when you just take
the first degree sum, right

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.566
over here, where you
take the sum of the roots

00:05:27.566 --> 00:05:28.400
to the first power.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.900
But let's just see if it
works for the third power.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.220
So let's say, I have
the polynomial x

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:44.800
to third plus a1x squared, plus
a2x, plus a3 is equal to 0.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.240
We have three roots.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.140
r1, r2, r3, which
tells us that we

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.570
can rewrite this
polynomial as x minus--

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.400
or this equation as
x minus r1, times

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:05.910
x minus r2, times x
minus r3 is equal to 0.

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.730
Now we already figured out
what this part right here

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:12.510
is, it's this thing over here.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:13.750
We already multiplied it out.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.350
It's this thing.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.215
It is this over here.

00:06:17.215 --> 00:06:19.090
So essentially, to get
this whole expression,

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.755
we just have to multiply this
times this thing over here.

00:06:23.755 --> 00:06:26.380
We can just use the distributive
property-- multiple this thing

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.960
times each of these terms.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.410
So first, let's multiply
this whole thing by x.

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:40.070
So you get x to the third, minus
r1 plus r2 times x squared,

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:43.160
plus r1r2x.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.680
So I just multiplied this
thing over here times x.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.430
Now I can just multiply
this thing up here

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.260
times negative r3.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.480
So negative r3 times x squared.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.670
Negative r3 times this term over
here, it will give us-- well

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.990
it's going to be a
negative times a negative,

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.290
so it's going to be a
positive-- so it's positive

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:06.430
r3 three times this.

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:07.750
We can distribute them.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:12.890
We're going to get r1-- so
let me make sure I'm doing.

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:18.340
Negative r3 times this over
here is going to be negative--

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.710
let me just write it like this.

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:21.054
I don't want to skip steps.

00:07:21.054 --> 00:07:23.220
So it's going to be-- the
negative and the negatives

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:23.840
cancel out.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:30.270
So negative r3
times r1 plus r2 x.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:34.570
And then finally, you have
the negative r3 times r1r2.

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:36.280
So minus r1r2r3.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.440
And all of that's
going to be equal to 0.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.490
But let's simplify it.

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:44.840
So this thing is
going to be equal to x

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:49.920
to the third minus
r1 plus r2 plus r3--

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.710
we did that in the last video.

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:53.880
That shows us that
the sum of our roots

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.470
is this second coefficient
here, the coefficient

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:59.470
on the second degree
term, x squared.

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:01.480
And then, we go over here.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.075
We have r1r2, x.

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:08.990
Then you have r1, r3 x.

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:12.060
Plus r1r3-- I'm just
distributing this.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:13.520
And then you have r3 times r2.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.270
So plus r2r3.

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:21.960
All of that times x, and
then minus r1r2 and r3.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.880
Now if we want to take the sum
of the squares of the roots.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:32.320
So if we want to take r1
squared plus r2 squared plus r3

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.970
squared, well, we could
try to do the same thing.

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:39.380
We could take r1
plus r2 plus r3,

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.620
which we know how to
calculate-- we can square that.

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.150
And we're essentially
going to get--

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:45.605
When you square
this you're going

00:08:45.605 --> 00:08:47.480
to get-- let me see if
I can write it neatly.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:51.444
This is going to be
equal to r1 times--

00:08:51.444 --> 00:08:53.360
So I'm just going to--
let me just rewrite it.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.070
This is equal to--
just to clarify,

00:08:55.070 --> 00:09:05.550
this is equal to r1 plus r2 plus
r3, times r1 plus r2 plus r3.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:07.620
So it's going to be-- I
could start over here.

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:12.960
r1 times r1 is r1 squared,
plus r1 times r2-- so

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.523
r1r2-- plus r1 times r3.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.660
And then, plus--
now we're in the r2.

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:25.107
r2 times r1 is plus
r1r2-- same thing,

00:09:25.107 --> 00:09:27.190
I'm just switching the
order so it looks the same.

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:30.860
r2 times r2 is r2 squared.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:35.340
And then, r2 times
r3 is plus r2r3.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:38.140
And then let's go to the
r3, r3 times r1 is just

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:41.960
another r3r1-- I just
switched the order.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:45.750
r3 times r2 is another r2r3.

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:49.475
And then, r3 times
r3 is r3 squared.

00:09:49.475 --> 00:09:50.850
So what did we
just get here when

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:53.820
we squared just the
straight up sum?

00:09:53.820 --> 00:10:00.870
You got r1 squared plus r2
squared plus r3 squared,

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:03.990
plus-- you essentially got all
of the different combinations,

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:05.010
but you got them twice.

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:08.690
You have two r1r2, so
you have 2 times r1r2.

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:16.390
Then you have two r1r3, so plus
r1r3-- I have the 2 out front.

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:17.270
Plus r2r3.

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:23.700
And this over here is
equal to-- remember

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:30.380
what we did-- this is equal
to r1 plus r2 plus r3 squared.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.770
So we got essentially
the same result.

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:35.880
Remember, this thing right over
here-- let's make things clear.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:39.910
This thing over here
r1-- all the combinations

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:41.840
of the products of the roots.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.780
If you look over here,
that's exactly what

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:46.140
this thing is over
here, which must

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:48.680
be what our a2 coefficient is.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.690
So this is our a2 coefficient.

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:54.972
This r1 plus r2 plus
r3, that is-- we

00:10:54.972 --> 00:10:56.430
figured out multiple
times-- that's

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:59.650
this thing right over here,
which is going to be a1.

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:01.555
So this is going
to be a negative,

00:11:01.555 --> 00:11:03.080
or it's equal to negative a1.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.014
But you take
negative a1 squared,

00:11:05.014 --> 00:11:06.680
and that's the same
thing as a1 squared.

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.680
So this is a1 squared.

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:12.120
And this is the sum
that we care about.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:19.300
So we get r1 squared plus
r2 squared plus r3 squared

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:22.510
is equal to this
business over here.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:29.560
It's equal to a1 squared
minus 2 times a2.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:34.260
So we got the exact
same result that we

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.410
got for the second degree case.

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:39.140
And it actually turns out this
will be true of any degree.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:41.060
I haven't proven to
you yet, although I

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:42.560
can make an induction
argument now--

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.050
we've proven some base cases.

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:46.390
But just to make it
clear how to apply it,

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:49.020
I give you crazy polynomial.

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:51.560
I give you-- Let's do
a third degree case,

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:56.980
let's say, 10x to
the third minus 5 x

00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:04.260
squared, plus 7x-- I'm making
this up on the fly-- plus 2

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.130
is equal to 0.

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:07.770
And if I were to
ask you the sum?

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:11.354
If I were to ask you r1
squared plus r2 squared plus r3

00:12:11.354 --> 00:12:13.520
squared-- If I were to ask
you the square of the sum

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:18.572
of the roots, you just take--
well, let me be careful.

00:12:18.572 --> 00:12:20.030
You have to make
sure that you have

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:22.480
a one in front of the
highest degree term.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.920
So this thing over here,
has to be rewritten.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:30.430
Divide both sides by 10 x to
the third minus 5 over 10,

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:35.150
so minus 1/2 x
squared, plus 7 over 10

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:41.510
x, plus 2 over 10, which
is one fifth is equal to 0.

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:44.540
So I just divided
both sides by 10,

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.220
and yup, I did that part right.

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:47.746
And now, we can apply this.

00:12:47.746 --> 00:12:49.120
I almost made a
careless mistake.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.370
You have to have a one
coefficient out here, at least,

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:53.090
the way that we've derived this.

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:58.920
So this sum is going to
be equal to a1 squared.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.600
So it's this-- 1/2 squared.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.660
So a1 is actually negative
1/2, but negative 1/2 half

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.340
squared is just one fourth.

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:17.070
So it is going to be one
fourth minus 2, times a2.

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:21.700
So minus 2 times 7 over 10.

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:28.720
So this is equal to one
fourth minus 14 over 10.

00:13:31.554 --> 00:13:33.220
We could find a common
denominator here.

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:41.720
This is the same thing as
5 over 20 minus 14 over 10.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:48.940
And this is equal-- or sorry,
minus 28 over 20, I should do,

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:52.340
which is equal to
negative 23 over 20.

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:54.300
And you might say,
hey, Sal, hang on.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:57.060
I'm taking the square of a bunch
of roots and adding them up,

00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:58.980
and I'm getting a
negative number.

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.470
I thought squares-- I thought
y squared numbers I always

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:04.430
get a positive number that
would be true if you're dealing

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:07.570
with real numbers, but remember
the words of a polynomial

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:09.830
can be complex and
complex numbers

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:12.970
squared can be negative numbers.

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:17.200
So this obviously is involving
some type of complex roots.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.590
But we know that
the sum when you

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:21.240
take the sum of the squares
of those complex roots you

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:24.860
get negative 23 over 22.
