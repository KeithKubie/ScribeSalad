00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is 1/3, 0, 0.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I guess you can write this as 0.33.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The analogy is exactly as before.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Clearly he won't show me door number 2, because that's the one I placed by bet on.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Three he won't show me because it actually contains the car.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So he shows me 1. With absolutely certainty, he'll show me 1.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Yet, this case is only 1/3 likely,

00:00:20.000 --> 99:59:59.000
because it's only 1/3 likely that the car is behind door number 3. Gives us 1/3.
