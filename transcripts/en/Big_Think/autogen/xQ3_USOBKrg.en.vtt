I think it's surprising and really

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899
I think it's surprising and really
 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.339
I think it's surprising and really
pleasing to think about things that you

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349
pleasing to think about things that you
 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.350
pleasing to think about things that you
do know

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:11.360
do know
 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.530
do know
but you haven't turned them over in your

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540
but you haven't turned them over in your
 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.640
but you haven't turned them over in your
mind it's almost like a rock that when

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650
mind it's almost like a rock that when
 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.099
mind it's almost like a rock that when
you flip it over you see all kinds of

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109
you flip it over you see all kinds of
 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.890
you flip it over you see all kinds of
bugs and dirt and the whole thing is

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900
bugs and dirt and the whole thing is
 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.439
bugs and dirt and the whole thing is
just moving and etc it's the same rock

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449
just moving and etc it's the same rock
 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.630
just moving and etc it's the same rock
you've just flipped it over so here's an

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640
you've just flipped it over so here's an
 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.110
you've just flipped it over so here's an
example so an oak tree you know maybe

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120
example so an oak tree you know maybe
 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.760
example so an oak tree you know maybe
you've had an oak tree in your life or

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770
you've had an oak tree in your life or
 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.670
you've had an oak tree in your life or
your yard or whatever so I do the

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680
your yard or whatever so I do the
 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.729
your yard or whatever so I do the
experiment where I say what if every

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739
experiment where I say what if every
 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:41.959
experiment where I say what if every
single ACORN

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969

that oak tree ever produced turned into

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700
that oak tree ever produced turned into
 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.959
that oak tree ever produced turned into
another tree what if every acorn that

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969
another tree what if every acorn that
 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.420
another tree what if every acorn that
was ever produced by every tree turned

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430
was ever produced by every tree turned
 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.689
was ever produced by every tree turned
into another tree well animals would

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699
into another tree well animals would

could move and that allows me to step

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989
could move and that allows me to step
 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.469
could move and that allows me to step
into the very interesting story of how

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479
into the very interesting story of how
 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.289
into the very interesting story of how
plants approach reproduction so

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299
plants approach reproduction so
 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.670
plants approach reproduction so
differently than we do they put out

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680
differently than we do they put out
 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.260
differently than we do they put out
mind-boggling numbers of offspring and

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270
mind-boggling numbers of offspring and
 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.050
mind-boggling numbers of offspring and
then those offspring have very very low

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060
then those offspring have very very low
 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.929
then those offspring have very very low
odds of success they have very low odds

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939
odds of success they have very low odds
 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.420
odds of success they have very low odds
of germinating and other the ones that

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430
of germinating and other the ones that
 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.910

even start to grow a vast vast subset
 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.940
even start to grow a vast vast subset
will actually rut and of those a vast

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950
will actually rut and of those a vast
 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.020
will actually rut and of those a vast
subset will grow to any kind of height

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030
subset will grow to any kind of height
 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.300
subset will grow to any kind of height
and then of that another tree right so

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310
and then of that another tree right so
 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.030
and then of that another tree right so
if an oak tree produces acorns for a

if an oak tree produces acorns for a
hundred years in a row all it needs is

hundred years in a row all it needs is
 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.030
hundred years in a row all it needs is
one of those acorns to become the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040
one of those acorns to become the
 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.679
one of those acorns to become the
replacement tree to still have an oak

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689

right so the seed and you've seen

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110
right so the seed and you've seen
 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.039
right so the seed and you've seen
hundreds of thousands of seeds just in

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049
hundreds of thousands of seeds just in
 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.179
hundreds of thousands of seeds just in
one month probably you you know let

alone in the food you eat you come

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689
alone in the food you eat you come
 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.719
alone in the food you eat you come
across seeds all the time but each one

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729
across seeds all the time but each one
 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.420
across seeds all the time but each one
of those seeds is an impossible thing

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430
 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.009
it's it's a piece of hope that's

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019
it's it's a piece of hope that's
 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.309
it's it's a piece of hope that's
produced with almost no chance of

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319
produced with almost no chance of
 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.770
produced with almost no chance of
success and then you can flip that over

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780
success and then you can flip that over
 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.410
success and then you can flip that over
and say every tree that you see was once

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420
and say every tree that you see was once
 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.460
and say every tree that you see was once
a hopeless seed like that and so the

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470
a hopeless seed like that and so the
 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.550
a hopeless seed like that and so the
trees in front of us are this impossible

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560
trees in front of us are this impossible
 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.210
trees in front of us are this impossible
thing it's it's this impossible journey

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220
thing it's it's this impossible journey
 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.979
thing it's it's this impossible journey
that almost never happens

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989
that almost never happens
 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.789
that almost never happens
and yet it results in something that's

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799
and yet it results in something that's
 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.059
and yet it results in something that's
the biggest oldest longest living life

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069
the biggest oldest longest living life
 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:50.670
the biggest oldest longest living life
form on the terrestrial surface and so I

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680
form on the terrestrial surface and so I
 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.119
form on the terrestrial surface and so I
think the real joy for me is that I can

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129
think the real joy for me is that I can
 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:55.800
think the real joy for me is that I can
take things that are already familiar to

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810
take things that are already familiar to
 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.349
take things that are already familiar to
you and by sharing the story of how I've

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359
you and by sharing the story of how I've
 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:03.690
you and by sharing the story of how I've
learned to look at them you can see

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700
learned to look at them you can see
 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.930
learned to look at them you can see
those things you've been seeing a little

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940
those things you've been seeing a little
 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.449
those things you've been seeing a little
differently with a little more joy and a

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459
differently with a little more joy and a
 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.339
differently with a little more joy and a
little more connection and that's what I

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349
little more connection and that's what I
 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.229
little more connection and that's what I
really like to do so I talk about

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239
really like to do so I talk about
 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.530
really like to do so I talk about
curiosity driven research as questions

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540
curiosity driven research as questions
 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.539
curiosity driven research as questions
that we try to answer why is that tree

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549
that we try to answer why is that tree
 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.500
that we try to answer why is that tree
growing successfully in that place but

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510
growing successfully in that place but
 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.440
growing successfully in that place but
never in that place that's a curiosity

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450
never in that place that's a curiosity
 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.300
never in that place that's a curiosity
question it's the kind of question a

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310
question it's the kind of question a
 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.830
question it's the kind of question a
little kid could come up with why don't

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840
little kid could come up with why don't
 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.349
little kid could come up with why don't
we have those trees at our house now

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359
we have those trees at our house now
 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:37.140
we have those trees at our house now
buried in the answer might be something

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150
buried in the answer might be something
 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.400
buried in the answer might be something
that could give us better fruit someday

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410
that could give us better fruit someday
 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.890
that could give us better fruit someday
that we can sell in the marketplace and

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900
that we can sell in the marketplace and
 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.500
that we can sell in the marketplace and
feed hungry people with but that result

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510
feed hungry people with but that result
 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.949
feed hungry people with but that result
that application to growing food for

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959
that application to growing food for
 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.129
that application to growing food for
people is buried several steps below

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:53.139
people is buried several steps below
 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:56.490
people is buried several steps below
that answer my part of that is to look

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500
that answer my part of that is to look
 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.759
that answer my part of that is to look
at that first answer what is that tree

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769
at that first answer what is that tree
 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.569
at that first answer what is that tree
what does it do why is it there and we

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579
what does it do why is it there and we
 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.599
what does it do why is it there and we
call that the curiosity driven piece

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609
call that the curiosity driven piece
 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:08.490
call that the curiosity driven piece
because that answer will be basically

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500
because that answer will be basically
 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.909
because that answer will be basically
turned over to other experts who know

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:11.919
turned over to other experts who know
 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:14.939
turned over to other experts who know
how that might play out into something

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:14.949
how that might play out into something
 

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:17.360
how that might play out into something
that is important for the marketplace

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370
that is important for the marketplace
 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.800
that is important for the marketplace
but there's no substitute for that first

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810
but there's no substitute for that first
 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.290
but there's no substitute for that first
step for that little kid question and

step for that little kid question and
all the work that goes you've got to get

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:24.099
all the work that goes you've got to get
 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:25.220
all the work that goes you've got to get
a bus ticket and

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230
a bus ticket and
 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:26.690
a bus ticket and
go to that place you got to go to that

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700
go to that place you got to go to that
 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.310
go to that place you got to go to that
place you've got to count them you've

place you've got to count them you've
 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.720
place you've got to count them you've
got to bring some of the tissues back

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730
got to bring some of the tissues back
 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.630
