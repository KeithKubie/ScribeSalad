00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's see, if someone tell me the position, could I figure out where the object was.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's say they told me they were here.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Well, to find out this position, I know they're either on this part of the diagram

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
or over here in this part of the diagram.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
But that doesn't tell me what the angle is--it might be this angle or it might be that angle.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I can do the same sort of thinking with velocity--it's not enough information to determine the angle.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The only thing that would tell me the angle, assuming I know the starting position, is the time,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and don't worry if you didn't get this one--this is a very, very tricky one.

00:00:31.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Now, how does the time relate to angle.
