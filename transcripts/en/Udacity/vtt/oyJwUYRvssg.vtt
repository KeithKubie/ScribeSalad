00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So, in summary, we talked about the maximum likelihood estimator,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and we even derived it mathematically for those of you who had the patience to stay on.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It's a really simple formula. It's what's called the empirical count.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We talked about the Laplace estimator, which added k fake data points, 1 for each possible outcome,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and that resulted in the slightly more complex out, as shown in this formula over here.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and we identified cases where the Laplace estimator is much better than the maximum likelihood estimator,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
specifically when there isn't much data.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
When there isn't much data, fake it by adding more data.

00:00:38.000 --> 99:59:59.000
I'll see you in class in the next unit.
