00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.950
It's called an inception module.

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.470
It's going to look
a little more complicated.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.530
And you can skip this
section if you'd like.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.550
It's not essential to
the rest of the lecture.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.960
The idea is that at each layer of
your cognate you can make a choice.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.748
Have a pooling operation,
have a convolution.

00:00:18.748 --> 00:00:25.050
Then you need to decide is it a 1 by 1
convolution, or a 3 by 3, or a 5 by 5?

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.280
All of these are actually beneficial
to the modeling power of your network.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.400
So why choose?

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.140
Let's use them all.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.560
Here's what an inception
module looks like.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.458
Instead of having a single convolution,

00:00:37.458 --> 00:00:41.926
you have a composition of average
pooling followed by a 1 by 1,

00:00:41.926 --> 00:00:46.418
then a 1 by 1 convolution,
then a 1 by 1 followed by a 3 by 3.

00:00:46.418 --> 00:00:48.998
Then a 1 by 1 followed by a 5 by 5.

00:00:48.998 --> 00:00:52.840
And at the top, you simply concatenate
the output of each of them.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.530
It looks complicated, but

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.570
what's interesting is that you can
choose these parameters in such a way

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.320
that the total number of parameters
in your model is very small.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.630
Yet the model performs better than
if you had a simple convolution.
