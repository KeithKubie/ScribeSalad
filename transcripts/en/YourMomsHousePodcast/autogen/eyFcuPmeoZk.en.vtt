is scary to get married and it is scary
to get this responsible with the jumping

to get this responsible with the jumping
 

01:26:14.940 --> 01:26:15.650
to get this responsible with the jumping
in the

01:26:15.650 --> 01:26:15.660
in the
 

01:26:15.660 --> 01:26:17.750
in the
yeah well cuz I remember when Tom and I

01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:17.760
yeah well cuz I remember when Tom and I
 

01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:19.250
yeah well cuz I remember when Tom and I
first got married there were times when

01:26:19.250 --> 01:26:19.260
first got married there were times when
 

01:26:19.260 --> 01:26:21.590
first got married there were times when
I felt like I had a run like if we

01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:21.600
I felt like I had a run like if we
 

01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:23.450

fought or something I'd be like I gotta

01:26:23.450 --> 01:26:23.460
fought or something I'd be like I gotta
 

01:26:23.460 --> 01:26:25.730
fought or something I'd be like I gotta
go head for the hills and I think that's

01:26:25.730 --> 01:26:25.740
go head for the hills and I think that's
 

01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:27.500
go head for the hills and I think that's
like a childhood thing that I had to

01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:27.510
like a childhood thing that I had to
 

01:26:27.510 --> 01:26:29.030
like a childhood thing that I had to
resolve in therapy obviously I don't

01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:29.040
resolve in therapy obviously I don't

01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:33.650
feel that way now Tommy but it's a
process you know I think it's a process

01:26:33.650 --> 01:26:33.660
