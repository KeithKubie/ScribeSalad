00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.307
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We know negative 4, 3 is a solution to our system of equation. Well, we can

00:00:04.307 --> 00:00:08.722
also check it to be sure. Here are the 2 original equations, and here was our

00:00:08.722 --> 00:00:13.259
solution. We want to check our solution in each equation and make sure that we

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.697
wind up with true statements at the end. Try doing that, and make sure these

00:00:17.697 --> 00:00:18.618
numbers match.
