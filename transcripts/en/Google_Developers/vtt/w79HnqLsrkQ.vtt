DANIEL SIEBERG: Hi there.

00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.350
I'm Daniel Sieberg, and you're
watching I/O Live.

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.670
We're here at Google I/O , and
we're going to be showcasing

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.280
content from different partners,
from Googlers.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.860
Of course, giving you tours of
all the sandboxes here at

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.720
Moscone Center over the
next couple of days.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.340
And truth be told, we're
actually here before the doors

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.630
opened in Androidville, and
we're going to start out by

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.200
talking to Andrew from
Crittercism.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.220
So, Andrew, tell me, what
is Crittercism?

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.870
I'm a little worried about
some of these creatures

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.680
coming after me.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.540
What does it mean to monitor
apps and get that real time

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.655
information for a lot
of developers?

00:00:32.655 --> 00:00:33.670
ANDREW LEVY: Sure, yeah.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.780
So, we are a cross-platform
crash reporting and error

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.470
analysis tool for mobile
app developers.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.090
In a broader sense, we help
them find performance

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.910
bottlenecks.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.070
The story is that there's a lot
of great testing companies

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.080
here today, but the fact is,
the mobile ecosystem,

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.090
especially Android, is moving
so quickly that really, you

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.620
need a diagnostic tool to help
you once you release your

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:57.510
application.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.740
And that's really
what we provide.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.720
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah, let's go
through a spin here, if you

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.560
can give us a demo.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.270
ANDREW LEVY: We can jump
right in, here.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.550
So, this is when a developer
integrates our SDK, it takes

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.220
less than five minutes
to get started.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.430
They see this page, and this is
all their crashes that have

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.030
occurred over time.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.370
So we're essentially
a big data company.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.090
We're crunching all this data
and helping tell you what are

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.060
the most critical problems
affecting your user base.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.230
DANIEL SIEBERG: And this is an
overarching look at what's

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.670
going on, but you can
even drill down to

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.920
a particular user?

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.360
ANDREW LEVY: Yeah, and so the
data gets extremely granular.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.610
So, these are all issues.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.770
You can drill down to a
particular problem.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.550
We give the engineers a look
in the stack trace.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.360
If there's a localization issue,
they can quickly drill

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.160
in where on the map.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.150
We also provide some
diagnostics.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.280
So, the idea here is we help
recreate what the average user

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.380
looks like at the time when
they had a problem.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.100
So if it was a member
leak, you'd see this

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.880
skewed to the right.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.245
If they ran out of disk space,
you'd quickly see that.

00:01:50.245 --> 00:01:53.960
If it was a device-specific
problem or an OS-specific

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.550
issue, it would quickly
become apparent here.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.810
And the idea is that we help
you recreate the issue

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.490
internally and quickly
push out a fix.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.980
DANIEL SIEBERG: And earlier,
you were showing me what

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.060
looked like a heart rate monitor
view of what's going

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.060
on with different users.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.730
What's that all about?

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:08.070
ANDREW LEVY: Yeah.

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.789
So, everything we do
is in real time.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.490
So, these are app loads and
crashes as they come in.

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.630
So often, teams will
have this up on a

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:15.840
monitor as they release.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.020
And of course, they hope that
the error line right here is

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.640
flatlining, but issues,
or critters, do

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.600
creep out in the wild.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.940
In addition to that, we help the
manager of the team look

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.840
at a high level and how they're
doing over time.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.320
And so, on each successive
release, we give you an idea

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.220
if you're getting better
at fixing those bugs.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.000
DANIEL SIEBERG: Great.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.610
So this is all feedback that can
be used and shared across

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.550
the different teams.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.310
This is not just isolated
to one person who

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.200
can see this view.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.960
Anyone can get a quick
snapshot of all this.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.520
ANDREW LEVY: Yeah.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.950
It's a collaborative effort by
your engineering team, so they

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.780
can go in, they can comment on
these issues, they can close

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.210
bugs, they can drill down--

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.840
DANIEL SIEBERG: Prioritize,
right?

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.420
Based on the sheer volume of
responses that you're getting?

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.810
ANDREW LEVY: Yeah.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.030
You can imagine needing to
sort your crashes or your

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.370
errors by the number
of users affected.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.690
You imagine fixing the top 10,
and that's easily 75% of your

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.370
bugs gone right there.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.210
And it also ties into your
workflow, so there's support

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.350
integration where if you get
an email from a user

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.810
complaining, you can look them
up in our system and figure

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.230
out exactly what problems
they're having.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.160
And of course, integrations into
your bug tracking systems

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.620
and whatnot.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.580
DANIEL SIEBERG: Any quick
advice for anyone who's

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.750
developing on the Android
platform and how

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:29.630
this could help them?

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.660
ANDREW LEVY: Well,
we did some early

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.150
analysis that showed that--

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.060
I mean, it's pretty common, but
null pointer exceptions

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.560
and out of memory are the
top two issues that

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.340
we typically see.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.890
And so, make sure you pay
attention to your application

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.700
life cycle changes, and stop
allocating so many bitmaps.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.770
DANIEL SIEBERG: All right,
good advice.

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.070
Andrew from Crittercism,
thank you so much.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.850
And do you pay these guys?

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.210
Are they your employees?

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.060
ANDREW LEVY: Yeah, They seem
to follow us around

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.460
everywhere.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.140
DANIEL SIEBERG: Thank you.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.368
ANDREW LEVY: Thanks.

00:03:57.368 --> 00:03:58.940
DANIEL SIEBERG: Man,
I am winded.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.050
Androidville's a big place.

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:01.370
I don't know if you
noticed that.

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.280
We're here with Pebble and Eric
to talk about what Pebble

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.320
is, but also, of course, about
how Android ties in, and

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.690
developers who are creating
some cool

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.240
stuff for this watch.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.240
So talk us through what Pebble
is, and we'll get to why

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.700
running's tied into
this as well.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.510
ERIC MIGICOVSKY: So, Pebble's a
smart watch that talks your

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:18.370
cell phone.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.019
You can do things, normal watch
things, like look at the

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.100
time, and stop watch, and
that kind of stuff.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.210
But the really cool thing about
Pebble is that you can

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.520
write apps for the watch and
integrate Pebble with apps

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.430
that run on your
Android phone.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.010
So we're today launching an
SDK that enables Andrew

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.220
developers to push intents
to our app that get

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.260
forwarded to watch.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.080
DANIEL SIEBERG: That's
very cool.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.510
So it's a watch that's a
platform as well, in a sense,

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.890
and you've partnered with
RunKeeper to talk about one

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.210
here today that a lot of people
who are jogging and

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.420
runners would appreciate,
because you get that

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.315
at-a-glance, sort of, a use with
your watch rather than

00:04:54.315 --> 00:04:55.150
having to pull out your phone.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.750
ERIC MIGICOVSKY: Yeah.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.650
So, RunKeeper's the first app
that we've integrated with,

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.480
and we were just chatting with
their developer this week.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.800
He was able to integrate
RunKeeper with Pebble

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.970
in about one hour.

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.630
So, what that meant was he
added features that were

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.510
unavailable to RunKeeper
users before.

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.630
And using pebble, yeah, it just
makes its own app that

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:17.310
much better.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.310
So, one of the really cool
things you can do is, if

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.720
you're going for a run--

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.040
normally when you're going for
run with RunKeeper, you've got

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:29.040
your phone going, GPS connected,
in your pocket.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.470
But if you're, say, stopped, you
see a friend on the street

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.100
or something like that, and
you chat for a moment, you

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.470
have to press the pause button
in the app or it auto-detects

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:39.860
it after a little while.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.730
But with Pebble, if you want to
pause, you can just pause

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:44.540
it, and then when you want to
start your activity again, you

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.228
can just click the button
here, and--

00:05:46.228 --> 00:05:48.470
[PEBBLE WATCH - "Activity
resumed."]

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.240
ERIC MIGICOVSKY: -- and it
starts your run again.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.170
The cool thing about Pebble and
RunKeeper together is that

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.620
instead of having to look at
your phone to see your stats,

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.090
like your distance traveled,
your laps time, or your pace,

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.290
you can just look down to your
watch and see all the details

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.820
on your watch.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.150
It's kind of like a heads-up
display for the app.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:09.920
DANIEL SIEBERG: Any advice you
would give to developers who

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.870
are really excited about doing
something for Pebble, whether

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.360
it's something related to
sports, or activities, or just

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.150
getting through life without
having to pull out your phone

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.860
all the time?

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:20.970
What sort of things
are you looking at

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:21.630
coming down the pike?

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.500
ERIC MIGICOVSKY: Well, I think
at the beginning, Pebble's

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.540
going to be really useful
for sports and fitness

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:26.530
applications.

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.560
That heads-up display is
going to be great.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.100
I can imagine going for a day on
the mountain, like skiing,

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.180
with Pebble.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.770
Instead of having to take my
phone out on the chair lift to

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.810
see who's called or who's sent
me an email, I can just look

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.980
down to my watch and see that,
and then at same time, see how

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.570
fast I've been going.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:45.190
Other things that are great with
Pebble are notifications.

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:51.245
So, what we really want to
encourage people to do is use

00:06:51.245 --> 00:06:53.250
Pebble as well as the
notification bar.

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.050
So if your app spits out
notifications that pop up on

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.185
the top notification shade,
you can also register an

00:06:59.185 --> 00:07:02.220
intent that will send that
notification to the watch.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:05.450
So, imagine if you're writing an
IM client, or stock market

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:09.910
app, or weather app, or any sort
of local check-in app, it

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:11.730
would be great to be able to get
those notifications right

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:12.390
on your wrist.

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:15.300
The user can feel the vibration
from the watch and

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.180
instantly see what's going
on without even

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.575
pulling up their phone.

00:07:18.575 --> 00:07:19.980
DANIEL SIEBERG: Tell me a little
bit about the history

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.790
of Pebble for folks
who don't know.

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.190
You got your start, in a
sense, on Kickstarter.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:27.410
Huge response, coming out when,
what sort of interest

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:29.310
have you seen since you
announced this?

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:29.680
ERIC MIGICOVSKY: Yeah.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.440
So, we've been working on
watches for a little while

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.130
now, but we launched Pebble,
our latest watch, on

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:35.750
Kickstarter a couple
months ago.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:42.405
In about one month, we sold
over 85,000 watches.

00:07:42.405 --> 00:07:46.150
And the Pebble watches will
start coming out in the fall,

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:48.870
and users will start downloading
apps for Pebble

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:50.190
watches right around then.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:52.420
So, we're opening our SDK out.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.320
Actually, today we're launching
the Android SDK, and

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.480
more portions of the SDK will
come out over the summer.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.740
People will be able to write
their own watch faces that

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.870
actually run right
on the watch.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:05.390
But today's the first time that
we're talking about the

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:08.640
intent-based API, which allows
Android developers to push

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.155
intents to the watch.

00:08:10.155 --> 00:08:12.780
DANIEL SIEBERG: Any other sort
of advice you would give to

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.270
developers who were curious
about doing

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:15.095
something with this?

00:08:15.095 --> 00:08:17.050
ERIC MIGICOVSKY: We're going
to have an emulator out in

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:19.560
August, so not only could you
start developing before the

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.070
watch comes out, but you'll
actually be able to see what

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:24.640
your app will look like when
you push things to

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.280
the watch, in August.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:26.900
DANIEL SIEBERG: Very cool.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:29.040
Are you wearing this all the
time, pretty much, now?

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:29.893
ERIC MIGICOVSKY: 24/7, yeah.

00:08:29.893 --> 00:08:30.880
That's cool.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:31.240
DANIEL SIEBERG: Great.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.419
Eric, thank you so much.

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:34.200
And I've got watch envy
at the moment.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.760
I feel like I've got
to get hold of one.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.429
How can people get one if
they want one still?

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:39.850
ERIC MIGICOVSKY: If you go to
getpebble.com, you can get in

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:41.059
line for picking up a watch.

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:42.630
And if you're a developer,
you can to go

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:45.700
developer.getpebble.com
to check it out.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:46.200
DANIEL SIEBERG: Great.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:46.900
Thank you so much.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.240
And I've got to run off now.

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:51.650
All right.

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:55.910
We have flown over here now to
talk to Hipmunk, and Ryan, who

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:56.740
works at Hipmunk.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:00.460
He's going to talk to
us about-- sorry.

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:01.880
These guys aren't even
paying attention.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.360
All right.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.895
This will be take three.

00:09:05.895 --> 00:09:06.510
All right.

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:09.990
We have flown over here to talk
to Ryan from Hipmunk,

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:12.410
Hipmunk being a travel
app, helps you

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:14.070
find flights and hotels.

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:17.150
And Ryan, we're going to give
folks a little demo of how it

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:18.520
works, but also, of course,
talk about the

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.480
experience with Android.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:23.790
So maybe walk us through the
idea of the agony ranking.

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:24.410
RYAN OLDENBURG: Sure.

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:27.345
So, we at Hipmunk
consider it--

00:09:27.345 --> 00:09:29.960
a kind of point for a lot of
people is travel planning,

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.360
especially on a phone,
because phones are a

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.510
very unique form factor.

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:34.720
And getting a lot of information
in a small space

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:35.940
is really difficult,
so it's something

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.050
we took pretty seriously.

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:40.690
One of the first things we
worked on was flight search,

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:43.280
which we took a lot of time
to make look good.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.530
So basically, to do a search,
you enter your city,

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:48.240
destination, dates, all
the standard stuff.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.890
Then once you've run a search,
you'll get to a result set

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:51.660
that looks like this.

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:52.920
And this is probably
different than

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.315
anything you've seen before.

00:09:54.315 --> 00:09:57.580
What we lay out are the flight
in a bar that shows you how

00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:59.510
long it is, whether or not
there's a layover, and

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:01.350
who's flying it.

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:04.490
In specific, we do a thing
called "sorting by agony,"

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:07.130
which is to say that we don't
strictly sort by price,

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:09.260
because we consider your
time worth something.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.020
So if you'll notice here, we
have a nonstop Delta flight

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:16.080
for $423, which is actually
above a US Airways, which is

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.390
less expensive, but both longer
and has a layover.

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:22.180
So we're kind of saying, it's
not that much more expensive

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:24.250
for how much time you're saving,
which in this case is

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:25.220
over three hours.

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.160
DANIEL SIEBERG: That's a good
point, that you could save

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.570
$100, but then you have a
layover for four hours, and

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:32.730
you end up hating yourself
for agreeing to that.

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:33.220
RYAN OLDENBURG: Exactly.

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:34.140
Travel is agonizing.

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.020
You just want to get to your
destination in as good a mood

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:37.070
as possible, right?

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:39.420
So, that's what agony is
designed to help you with.

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.010
But if you want to just see by
price, we're not going to let

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:42.550
you not do that.

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:43.230
We show by price.

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:45.750
You can see the least
expensive first.

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:48.940
And then, once you've selected
your flights, you can just go

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:50.060
ahead and book through
the app.

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.330
DANIEL SIEBERG: And it will
actually tie in your calendar,

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.550
too, if there are particular
dates that you need to

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:55.700
remember when you're
booking a flight.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:56.660
RYAN OLDENBURG: Yeah,
yeah, exactly.

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:59.480
So one of the things we added
very recently was what we call

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.360
calendar integration.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.330
So, often when you're planning
a trip, you'll have things on

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:06.050
your calendar you're traveling
for or events that you need to

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:07.970
avoid when you're picking a
flight, maybe an appointment

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:08.870
or something.

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:13.050
And so, what we'll do is
actually show those things

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:14.940
that are on your calendar
on the timeline, here.

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.830
So you can know, well, maybe
that morning flight isn't a

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.170
great idea because I need to
be somewhere until 10:00 or

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:19.950
something like that.

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:20.180
DANIEL SIEBERG: All right.

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:21.570
So you've helped us
with our flights.

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:24.070
Now we need to figure out the
hotel accommodations.

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:25.190
How does that work?

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:27.590
RYAN OLDENBURG: Well, you just
go over to a hotel search, and

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:29.690
the first thing we do is let
you pick your location, or

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:32.440
just do My Location, which is
pretty much always the case.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:33.910
You're just looking for
a hotel nearby.

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:36.500
So if we just do one for tonight
for one guest, we just

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:40.755
hit Search, and as the hotels
load in here, they start to

00:11:40.755 --> 00:11:42.155
place themselves on the map.

00:11:42.155 --> 00:11:43.660
DANIEL SIEBERG: Using Google
Maps, of course.

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:45.190
RYAN OLDENBURG: Yep, using
Google Maps, of course.

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:47.570
And we actually had a lot of
fun working with this on

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:49.120
Android in specific.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.780
The Google Maps SDK really
allowed us to do a lot of the

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:54.760
map stuff without really even
having to worry about it.

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:55.960
Just kind of took care
of it for us.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.990
So it was nice to have Google
helping us out with something

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:00.205
that really is technically
challenging.

00:12:00.205 --> 00:12:00.680
DANIEL SIEBERG: OK.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.270
So it looks like a bunch of
them have loaded in here.

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:03.270
RYAN OLDENBURG: Yep.

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:04.360
The search just finished.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.700
So on the map, you'll see
these gray pips and then

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:08.480
colored pips.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.320
So what we've done there is
we've shown where all the

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:13.100
hotels are and attempted to
suggest some of the ones that

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.250
would be the best value
for you, and those

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:16.340
are the colored pips.

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:19.340
So if you pick on one of them,
you can see what the hotel's

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:22.480
called, a little picture
of it, price, rating.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.530
And you can pop around, see
if one's more interesting.

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:27.570
Now, along with that calendar
integration, if you have an

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:30.340
event that you're coming to,
for example, San Francisco

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:33.010
for, we'll put a little pip on
the map that shows where that

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:36.400
event is so that you can know
what hotels are nearby.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.780
And then another thing we do,
which is pretty cool, is if

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:41.520
you haven't maybe been to a city
before, we do have what

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.160
are called heat maps, which
hopefully the Wi-Fi will load

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.480
in here pretty quick.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.490
But often, you don't really know
where you want to be in a

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:50.090
city, but what the heat maps do
is show you, well, here's

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:50.810
where all the food is.

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:52.320
Maybe you're a foodie, you want
to know where the best

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.630
restaurants are.

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:55.180
This will help you with
that suggestion.

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:57.380
The warmer it is, the more
likely some good food is going

00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.130
to be nearby.

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:00.820
Little things like that help
make the hotel such a lot

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:03.660
easier on a phone where you
don't really have room to go

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.690
and open a bunch of tabs,
learn about the city.

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:07.260
You just need to know
where to stay real

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:08.320
quickly and get it done.

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.040
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah,
make it efficient.

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:09.230
All right.

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:11.750
Just quickly, any sort of
learnings you can pass on to

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:14.800
other Android developers, and
something you maybe take away

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:15.420
from the experience?

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:15.800
RYAN OLDENBURG: Yeah, sure.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.610
So, I've worked on Android a
couple years, and the biggest

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:20.320
thing I've learned is often when
I face a problem, I want

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.580
to solve it with the tools
I already know.

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:26.770
But there's truly often a way
that Android is trying to get

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:28.830
you to use that they've built
into the system and made

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:29.920
really robust.

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:33.390
So, don't be afraid to take a
second and learn what Android

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:35.790
is suggesting you use,
because it'll pay for

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:36.780
itself in the long run.

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:38.980
It'll work with newer systems,
it'll look better as they

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:44.660
update the OS itself, and
instead of you aging without

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:47.190
the system, you get to
keep up for free.

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:48.920
And people will feel more
natural using your app,

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.710
because you're using things
that they're used to.

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:52.410
DANIEL SIEBERG: And less
stressed, which is what

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:54.510
Hipmunk is all about,
less-stress travel.

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:54.980
All right, Ryan.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:56.720
Safe travels as you're
on the go.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:57.300
We appreciate it.

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:58.184
RYAN OLDENBURG: Yeah,
definitely.

00:13:58.184 --> 00:13:59.070
It's been fun.

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:02.680
DANIEL SIEBERG: Photo sharing,
social, and Wi-Fi Direct.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:05.700
These are all things that are
part of Ekata Systems.

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:08.130
And I'm joined now by Alan to
talk about what that all

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:11.190
means, and with Android, of
course, in particular.

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:12.930
And your shirt says "Tapestry."
Tell me what

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:13.590
that's all about.

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:15.400
ALAN TSAI: Yes, thank
you, Daniel.

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.180
So, Ekata Systems, we aim to
make the mobile social

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:23.080
experience more personal and
more engaging by facilitating

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.750
interactions in the
physical world.

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:27.790
So, our first application, the
first incarnation of our

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:32.870
vision, is an app called
Tapestry, which is essentially

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:35.540
a proximity-based photo
show-and-tell application.

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:37.950
It allows you to share photos
with people who are close to

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:40.770
you, with the word "close" being
a double entendre, close

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:42.480
being people that you care
about, your friends and

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.530
family, and close from a
proximity distance standpoint.

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:47.320
DANIEL SIEBERG: So you can
choose who those people are

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.390
within your network.

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:48.900
ALAN TSAI: Absolutely.

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.340
You get to curate your photos
and curate the people that you

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:52.620
want to share those
photos with.

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:52.970
DANIEL SIEBERG: All right.

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:53.970
Can you run us through
a little demo?

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:55.040
ALAN TSAI: Sure.

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:58.810
So, the demo's actually running
on ICS, but the

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:02.740
product will only launch on
Jelly Bean, so you'll see some

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:04.020
minor differences and tweaks.

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:05.920
But we'll go ahead and run
through these right now.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.600
DANIEL SIEBERG: So these are as
though we're sharing with

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.620
these different devices here?

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:10.843
ALAN TSAI: Exactly.

00:15:10.843 --> 00:15:12.640
DANIEL SIEBERG: But I could
be anywhere within how

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:13.480
much space right now?

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:16.100
ALAN TSAI: Within 20 to 30
meters, but the idea of the

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.530
sharing, again, is the
experience we're after is

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:19.750
people huddling around.

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:22.750
For example, let's say everybody
goes to a concert.

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:25.310
Everybody perceives the night
from their own perspective,

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:27.650
from their own vision,
from their own lens.

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:30.020
And at the end the day, we're
all at 3:00 AM at the coffee

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:32.800
shop, and we're going through
pictures, and this is the

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.650
experience we're trying
to create.

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:36.540
DANIEL SIEBERG: So instead of
all huddling around one phone,

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:37.260
and hey, look at this--

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:37.590
ALAN TSAI: That's right.

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:38.810
Now they have their own
devices they can--

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:40.240
DANIEL SIEBERG: Absolutely, with
some interesting twists

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.710
to that experience.

00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:44.890
So, let's say, if here, we'll
pick a couple photos.

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:49.210
Speaking of concerts, let's say
we all went to a concert.

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:50.530
DANIEL SIEBERG: You're
choosing the photos

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:51.000
there, right now?

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:51.260
ALAN TSAI: Exactly.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.590
You're picking the photos, and
you hit a button-- that's the

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:55.670
curate button--

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:59.035
and in this version, it is
asking you to turn on Wi-Fi

00:15:59.035 --> 00:16:01.670
Direct, but in Jelly Bean, it'll
go straight to the app.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:05.120
So, another reason to upgrade
to Jelly Bean.

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.620
So, as soon as that's
turned on--

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:10.960
so right now, this phone is
broadcasting within the 20, 30

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:12.770
meter radius that you're
showing a slide show.

00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:14.940
Now, these are the folks, here--
you might not be able

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.190
to see on the screen--

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:18.476
these folks will--

00:16:18.476 --> 00:16:19.840
DANIEL SIEBERG: They're
receiving this

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.820
slide show, in a sense.

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:21.600
They're experiencing it.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.470
You're driving the vehicle or
the slide show, in a sense,

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.990
and they're participating.

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:25.280
ALAN TSAI: Absolutely.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:28.430
So they discover your slide
show, and as soon as they find

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:30.900
you, they'll click on you, and
you should get a request

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:32.880
saying someone's trying to
join your slide show.

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:39.190
You accept that, and the other
members join as well.

00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:40.770
Let's see if this
goes through.

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:42.570
Here it is, I'm sorry.

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:43.170
DANIEL SIEBERG: OK.

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:46.674
So we can see that it started
off here, on this device.

00:16:46.674 --> 00:16:49.190
ALAN TSAI: Let's see if
that goes through.

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:50.210
There it is.

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:54.200
So you see, all screens have the
photo, and as you scroll

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:58.490
through, everybody's image
moves in synchronicity.

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:00.930
If there's a photo that you
like, that you don't have on

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:02.910
your device, you simply
swipe down.

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:04.960
Maybe we switch the--

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:08.004
see if we can see on the
other side, here.

00:17:08.004 --> 00:17:10.030
DANIEL SIEBERG: So you can
actually share the photos as

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:11.680
well as show them to people?

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:12.810
ALAN TSAI: Absolutely.

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:15.260
So if this comes up, let's
see-- it does.

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:19.339
So as you see, what we see on
screen here is a client.

00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:22.910
When you swipe down, you'll
see the image is saved

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:24.970
directly, peer-to-peer,
from device to device.

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:28.510
Not a single bit goes over the
2G, 3G, 4G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth,

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:29.310
whatever it is.

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:31.800
It goes directly peer-to-peer,
from one device to another.

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:35.640
And going back to the idea of
the experience, if you pinch

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:38.744
to zoom, all the devices--

00:17:38.744 --> 00:17:40.610
DANIEL SIEBERG: They'll get
the same experience.

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:42.530
ALAN TSAI: Exactly right,
exactly right.

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:43.880
DANIEL SIEBERG: This is
really cool stuff.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.640
I mean, any learnings
from this?

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.330
Any takeaways for folks who are
developing on Android do

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:48.875
you want to share?

00:17:48.875 --> 00:17:49.490
ALAN TSAI: Absolutely.

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:52.400
Essentially for us, Wi-Fi Direct
is available for the

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.230
very first time, and
only in Android.

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:59.020
So, I think it really speaks to
the vision of Android, who

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.380
realized that technology as it
evolves should not just be

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.410
more powerful, but also
more personal.

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:06.700
And I think with a
proximity-based sensor using

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:09.460
Wi-Fi, I think it facilitates
a new type of interaction

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:10.310
between people.

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:12.620
DANIEL SIEBERG: And how can
folks get hold of this if they

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:13.620
want to try it out?

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:15.450
ALAN TSAI: We'll be going
live tomorrow.

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:16.650
DANIEL SIEBERG: OK.

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:17.720
Al, this is really cool stuff.

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:18.410
Thank you so much.

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:20.850
From Ekata Systems, Tapestry.

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:22.020
Be on the lookout for it.

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:22.290
ALAN TSAI: Thank you, Daniel.

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:23.540
DANIEL SIEBERG: Appreciate it.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:26.290
OK.

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:28.440
If you've ever had the
experience of having, let's

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:32.470
say, 20 or 30 tabs open in your
browser, or trying to

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:34.600
remember to read something or
view something later, well,

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.710
Pocket is to the rescue.

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:38.700
Nate is with Pocket, the
founder of Pocket.

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:39.780
It used to be called
Read It Later.

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:43.580
So, tell me about it, and was
that description accurate?

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:45.080
NATE WEINER: Absolutely, yeah.

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:49.040
As you said, the problem is that
we're running into great

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:53.030
content all day long, and the
issue ends up being that, as

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:55.200
you said, like you're emailing
yourself links, you have a

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.750
billion tabs open in your
browser, but ultimately the

00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:59.950
time that you discover that
content is not necessarily the

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:03.680
time that you want to view it,
or even really the best place

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.590
or the best device
to view it on.

00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:06.485
And that's why there's Pocket.

00:19:06.485 --> 00:19:08.090
DANIEL SIEBERG: So Pocket's
helping us with that

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:10.480
information overload, in
a sense, to organize

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:11.440
and save it for later.

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:11.800
NATE WEINER: Exactly.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.390
So instead of trying to remember
where you found that

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:16.810
article or that video, or
anything else you run across

00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:19.160
online, you can simply just put
it in Pocket, and it will

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:21.000
be in one place, accessible
from anywhere.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:21.240
DANIEL SIEBERG: All right.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.600
Well, let's have a look at this
sort of digital pocket

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:24.970
that you can put it
into, in a sense.

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:26.200
Now, you've got a laptop here.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.370
We've got a couple of
Android devices.

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:31.325
Tell me about how a website
can get saved into Pocket.

00:19:31.325 --> 00:19:31.650
NATE WEINER: Sure.

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:34.320
So for example, if I'm on my
computer, and I come across

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:37.260
some article that looks
interesting to me, I can

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:38.790
simply just save
that to Pocket.

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:40.380
And in this case, I'm using
our Chrome extension.

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.000
It's just a one click
save to Pocket.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.380
You can save articles,
you can save video,

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:46.220
you can save anything.

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:50.030
So for example, also here, I
can save a YouTube video.

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:53.070
And so, whenever I'm actually
ready to view that content--

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:54.680
so for example, if I'm
on my commute on

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:56.830
the way in to work--

00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:59.970
I can just simply pick up my
phone, and all that content

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:01.160
that I just saved is here.

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.475
DANIEL SIEBERG: And does it
save it chronologically?

00:20:02.475 --> 00:20:04.430
Is that how it comes
into your device?

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:07.680
NATE WEINER: You can order it
different ways, but generally,

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:10.580
newest is at the top and
it flows through.

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:17.010
So for example, this article
that I just saved here is now

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:19.290
on the device, and we formatted
it in this really

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:23.480
great, easy to view article
layout, as you can see.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.525
And it just synced right to the
phone without really me

00:20:25.525 --> 00:20:26.160
having to do anything.

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:26.880
DANIEL SIEBERG: So that's
a good point.

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.160
So, it used to be called Read
It Later, but you might want

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.710
to view something later,
shop somewhere later.

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:34.210
There are lots of iterations of
what you want to do later.

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:34.960
NATE WEINER: Exactly.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.520
So, you can very easily
switch between

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:38.520
different content modes.

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:41.390
So for example, if I just want
to see my videos, I can just

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:44.000
switch, and now all the videos,
and that YouTube video

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.170
that I just saved, is easy
to find as well.

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:47.280
DANIEL SIEBERG: Now, we've
got an Android tablet.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.680
Same sort of an experience.

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:52.570
What was it like developing to
get all this content across

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:54.785
different devices, and that
experience of consuming it

00:20:54.785 --> 00:20:55.230
differently?

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:57.320
NATE WEINER: So, Android's made
that really easy for us

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:58.370
for a number of reasons.

00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:00.550
So for example, the articles
and stuff I saved, they've

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:02.570
already synced to my
tablet as well.

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:05.880
If I have other devices or other
platforms, that's all in

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:07.120
sync immediately.

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.930
But Android, between a phone,
which is a small form factor,

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:13.320
and a big tablet form factor,
they've made things very easy

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:14.970
to move between those
different sizes.

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:16.720
The flexible layouts
and everything

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.510
have been really great.

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:21.760
But the best thing that we have
on Android is actually,

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.610
as I was just describing, the
fact that all this stuff

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:25.070
happened instantly.

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:27.080
That's something we can only
do on Android, even though

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:30.190
we're on other platforms as
well, is using C2DM, the

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:32.090
cloud-to-device messaging
system.

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:34.880
So essentially, the second I
hit Save To Pocket on the

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:38.560
computer, it messaged out to
all the devices to get that

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:40.900
content download and have it
ready to go, so that when

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:43.300
you're on the subway, even if
you don't have Wi-Fi, you can

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:44.250
actually view it.

00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:44.720
DANIEL SIEBERG: That's great.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.580
So, just finally, you want to
show us what it looks like on

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:47.470
the sample here?

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:49.230
NATE WEINER: Yeah, sure.

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:53.080
So, very similar layout,
but optimized

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:54.510
certainly for a tablet.

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:58.090
And again, I think what I use
tablets most for is viewing

00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:01.050
videos, so I'd love to be able
to just open up the video

00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:05.400
section, and just find something
to watch, and just

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.930
kick back on the couch and watch
videos, which is great

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:08.700
for a tablet.

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:11.710
DANIEL SIEBERG: Any advice or
learnings that you had with

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:13.750
the Android development
experience you want to share

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:14.190
with folks?

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:16.920
NATE WEINER: Yeah, so for
us, we certainly had an

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.880
interesting perspective, because
we are on so many

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.650
other platforms in addition
to Android.

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:25.200
And I'd say our biggest advice
is always if you're going to

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.680
build an Android app, build
an Android app.

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.680
If you look at our apps on other
platforms, we all really

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:32.800
respect the conventions of
each of those platforms.

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:37.570
And if you look at what Pocket
looks like on Android versus

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:41.590
on our website, or versus on our
iOS devices, we've made it

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:44.130
look like an Android app and
work really well as an Android

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:44.425
experience.

00:22:44.425 --> 00:22:45.070
DANIEL SIEBERG: Cool.

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:48.190
Well, Nate, thank you so much
for that demo from Pocket.

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:52.420
And speaking of later, stay
tuned for much more later here

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:53.240
on I/O Live.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.320
I'm Daniel Sieberg.

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.570
Stay tuned.
