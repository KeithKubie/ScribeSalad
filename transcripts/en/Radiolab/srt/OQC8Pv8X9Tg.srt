1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,210
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm
Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,140
Our topic today, songs that get
stuck in your head and won't unstick.

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:08,620
Now in the last section we would got,

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,390
we've talked about people who were invaded
by music and couldn't get the music

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,420
out of their heads. Yeah.

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:18,530
Now let's switch and talk about people
who desire more than anything to get a

7
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:21,570
tune a melody into their heads. Oh No,

8
00:00:21,571 --> 00:00:26,571
it was just specifically people who
are professional songwriters like Pam.

9
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:32,340
Hello, my name is Bob Darrow and
I'm visiting here with radio lab.

10
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,660
Is that it? What is it? It's radio.

11
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,310
Everybody is completely aware
of our program, but then again,

12
00:00:38,311 --> 00:00:41,820
not everybody would be necessarily
aware of Bob Durrow was that good?

13
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,900
But you may know this
conjunction junction.

14
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,230
What's your function, Liz?

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,230
I'm just a bill. Yes.

16
00:00:51,231 --> 00:00:55,340
I'm only up and I'm sitting
here on campus though.

17
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,770
This si low, my hero.
How wonderful you are.

18
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:05,060
If you grew up in the 1970s and 1980s
which I by the way, did not new.

19
00:01:05,061 --> 00:01:09,980
So everything that we've just heard
I never heard before. Oh my God,

20
00:01:09,981 --> 00:01:13,120
am I heard this? So you
know schoolhouse rock. Yeah.

21
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:17,840
And you have Bob Durrow to thank for all
the songs that will not eat your head

22
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,700
xe. We invited Bob over to
my apartment to sit my piano.

23
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:25,280
Talk a little bit about
Hook Enos. That's right.

24
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:30,260
What makes a song so sticky, so sticky
for your head? How does that happen?

25
00:01:30,261 --> 00:01:32,560
No one ever gets that. You get your,

26
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,050
he told us a story of getting a call.

27
00:01:36,051 --> 00:01:40,270
This was back in 1972 from a felon
named David [inaudible] call.

28
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,370
He was in advertising executive,

29
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,760
the president of a small
advertising agency,

30
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:50,680
and he simply said, my little boy
can't memorize the times tables,

31
00:01:50,681 --> 00:01:53,950
but he sings along with Jimmy Hendrickson,

32
00:01:53,951 --> 00:01:56,860
the rolling stones and gets their words,

33
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:00,160
why can't we put the
multiplication tables to music?

34
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:04,360
We'll call it multiplication in
rock. Why do you think looking at me?

35
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:09,870
And I said, yeah. Did you
say ea with confidence?

36
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:13,120
Well, then I did some research.

37
00:02:13,121 --> 00:02:18,121
I looked in the math books that I had
in my library and then I just came to me

38
00:02:19,391 --> 00:02:21,850
as the title three is a magic number.

39
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:30,580
[inaudible] hey, that's
good. [inaudible] match.

40
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,473
Want to hear Martin

41
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,280
somewhere in the ancient mystic trinity
and then I went to look in the Bible and

42
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,120
I looked everywhere, right?

43
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:47,010
It is one of the magic numbers and
then I thought of Buckminster Fuller.

44
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,460
Why button fits because of that
GDC film thing? Well, the triangle,

45
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:55,080
the train strongest shake there
can be because it can't bend.

46
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,380
A square can sag, right, and become
a parallelogram or something.

47
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:04,240
But a triangle is fixed match.
Very triangular parity, right?

48
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:10,480
Every tracking has three corners. Every
tracking has three sides, no more,

49
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,613
no less.

50
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:17,010
You don't have to guess when
it's three sees the magic number.

51
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,510
That's a badge. [inaudible]

52
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:29,590
I guess a magic as you can hear from
these remakes three really isn't magic.

53
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:30,803
Okay.

54
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,510
In any case, at the end
of this conversation,

55
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:38,650
I asked Bob Duro to think back way
back before you did schoolhouse rock,

56
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:41,680
before you became a jazz musician,
back to when you were a kid.

57
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:46,450
Do you remember the first time you got
a really good musical idea when a melody

58
00:03:46,451 --> 00:03:49,330
that kind of popped into your
head? He said, of course I do.

59
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:55,150
Let me play it for you. No,
the doorstep side by side.

60
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:01,250
Since I'm the doorstep when my bread
tonight sitting on the doorstep tonight,

61
00:04:04,271 --> 00:04:05,350
we'll do the forced.

62
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,720
Definitely known that
doorstep and that's all there.

63
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,350
That's all they are like that was
your first song. Not a bad melody.

64
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:19,120
[inaudible] terrible words.
I made it up plowing.

65
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:23,560
I was helping uncle John on the
phone. I was riding a heroin.

66
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:28,120
I don't care what you were around
here period. So right off the bat,

67
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,540
bomb bump on [inaudible].

68
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:36,910
That's a pretty good hook here.
What I care about is weird.

69
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,910
Did that come from,
from hearing pop music?

70
00:04:39,911 --> 00:04:44,911
You pick up the phone even though one
school I would say I knew something about

71
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:49,951
songs sub consciously form because it's a,

72
00:04:49,991 --> 00:04:52,180
it's the architecture of
all those other ones. Yeah.

73
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:56,350
Do these things like when you hit
the right one, do they like shout?

74
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:00,190
I'm the one they do. They do.
They do. I'm not gonna Forget it.

75
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:04,360
Now I can go to town and shop
for groceries, go to a movie,

76
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,840
and the next day it'll still be there
because it identifies its shelf almost

77
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,160
kind of like it feels like it
has. Suddenly it has weight.

78
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:16,840
I it has weight and
identity in there. It Ish,

79
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,063
it's there.

80
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:23,220
Sometimes I get the melody and then it's
just sheer labored and make the word

81
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,970
spirit. Where does the melody
come from? Melody comes the Muse.

82
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,010
You ever met this muse?

83
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:35,170
A lot of people are visited by the
Muse and they don't recognize her.

84
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,520
When you were plowing that day,
way back in a head amuse. Yeah,

85
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,680
but did you know that you had one or
do you just think it was just something

86
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:43,160
that like,

87
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,960
like like new shoes and I thought it was
something that just came out of the air

88
00:05:46,961 --> 00:05:49,450
to me. I wonder if I stole it.

89
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,220
That would, that would
worry, I guess. Yeah. Yeah.

90
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,860
Oh that's one of the
songwriters mean objectives.

91
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:05,610
When you think of a melody say,
am I stealing that? See that.

92
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,450
That's how mysterious this is.

93
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:12,770
You don't know whether the idea was
yours as originally yours or whether you

94
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:15,560
heard it in some earlier part of your
life and it belongs to someone else you

95
00:06:15,561 --> 00:06:16,191
don't know.

96
00:06:16,191 --> 00:06:20,990
So the muse is a tricky kind of goddess
and you know where it really gets extra

97
00:06:20,991 --> 00:06:21,720
tricky.

98
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,720
Imagine if you write a tune and it has
weight for you and people begin to enjoy

99
00:06:26,731 --> 00:06:27,780
it where you live.

100
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,550
And then very mysteriously it
begins to circle the world.

101
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:36,090
And people who don't share your
language, don't share yours.

102
00:06:36,091 --> 00:06:39,210
Tradition your culture. Share your tune.

103
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:43,890
That is really mysterious.
Okay, with that in mind, uh,

104
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,670
I got one for Ya.

105
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,830
Here is a delightful English artist,

106
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:51,390
England's popular young recording star
at Chula Clark. So let's have a very fine

107
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:56,150
welcome. This is a tune that was written
by a British guy who came in New York,

108
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:00,920
sang by a Parisian who everyone thought
was American and what they made.

109
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:06,110
Everybody knows. One of my
favorite records to the clock

110
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,890
down down though,

111
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,880
listen to the music downtown. And

112
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,820
this particular record has
special memories for me.

113
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:24,610
Bitter sweet memories if you
like, because, uh, I mean,

114
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,010
I'll pull the record out of the
case here. Um, there'd be, oh,

115
00:07:29,011 --> 00:07:33,600
this is the original single that I would
have bought at the time. High records,

116
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,750
no scratches. Always looked after.

117
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,470
I chewed a glock downtown
written by Tony Hatch.

118
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,110
I didn't write downtown
specifically for Petula Clark.

119
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,533
Yeah.

120
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,600
Well I'd been to New York in October,

121
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,710
1964 I stayed on central park,
turned left from the Essex Challenge

122
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:05,010
and a walk down Broadway. And by
the time I got down to Times Square,

123
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:09,060
I feel was strange that there
wasn't a song called downtown.

124
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,750
When you're alone and
life is making you lonely,

125
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,690
you can always go downtown.

126
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,890
Just listen to the music
of the traffic in the city.

127
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:24,310
Linger on the sidewalk, new on the
signs of prison. How can you be

128
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,780
lovies dally

129
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:37,510
[inaudible]

130
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,640
it had different leanings
in different places.

131
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:44,870
But for me on that first trip there,
it was the center of life. It was, um,

132
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:49,000
a great place to be. And even though
I was on my own, I didn't feel lonely.

133
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,680
That's the first line of the song.

134
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:54,510
When you're real low, none.
Life is making you lonely.

135
00:08:54,511 --> 00:08:58,330
You can go downtown.

136
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,570
I brought the idea back to the UK and
in those days in between recording

137
00:09:02,571 --> 00:09:04,940
sessions and mixing down
the recording session,

138
00:09:04,941 --> 00:09:08,960
I used to have about an hour in the
recording studio and I would go and sit in

139
00:09:08,961 --> 00:09:12,110
the studio and just a doodle
around. It was a good time.

140
00:09:12,111 --> 00:09:13,700
After a three hour recording session,

141
00:09:13,701 --> 00:09:16,640
the mind was very active and the
music was flowing very freely.

142
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:22,040
I actually then wrote the tune to
downtown and that was it. I left it.

143
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:26,470
Well, I remember when Tony Hatch
came to the apartment in Paris.

144
00:09:26,471 --> 00:09:29,890
That's where I was living at the time.
You know, I had moved over to France,

145
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,150
I'd married a Frenchman,

146
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:35,320
already had two small
children and a life was great.

147
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:40,420
This was I guess in 63 or four
and I said, well, I tell you what,

148
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,810
I'll go make a cup of tea and you
play something to me on the piano.

149
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:47,430
[inaudible].

150
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:50,500
I played her the bones of downtown, the,

151
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:55,670
the outline of it and the few words that
I had and put the word downtown into

152
00:09:56,491 --> 00:09:57,420
wherever it was going to go.

153
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:02,690
And I was in the kitchen making tea when
I first heard the music for downtown

154
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,600
and I absolutely adored it. And
I came back with a t and I said,

155
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,150
that's the one I wonder record.

156
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:11,510
That could be a fantastic
song and a great record.

157
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:15,680
We were in the studio maybe a couple of
weeks later and and recorded a monster.

158
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,920
Right? Right. Now, here's the
interesting thing. As the song grew,

159
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:24,550
something happened. The
meaning began to change a bit.

160
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:28,000
I mean, here's a song that was
initially a celebration of the city.

161
00:10:28,001 --> 00:10:30,880
You go downtown, you see the
bright lights, you with people,

162
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:34,150
you'll never be alone.
Well, after a while,

163
00:10:34,151 --> 00:10:39,151
Petula Clark and some of the people who
sang it expanded the song to include the

164
00:10:39,191 --> 00:10:42,100
exact opposite, meaning
instead of comforting,

165
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:47,230
the city is now a haunted place and
you are now more alone than ever.

166
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,500
Same Song, completely new flavor.

167
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,530
It's got a lot of character and a lot
of different angles you could take on it

168
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,520
too. One that sprung to mind for
us was the kind of blade runner,

169
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,660
like a much darker picture of
what it's like to go downtown.

170
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,493
[inaudible].

171
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,970
I always thought with the original that
it presented a very happy bright lights

172
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:23,631
thing,

173
00:11:23,631 --> 00:11:27,830
but you always had this
sense of shallowness that
if you were on your own and

174
00:11:27,831 --> 00:11:31,400
you went downtown, it probably stay
on your own and get quite depressed.

175
00:11:31,401 --> 00:11:34,310
Actually watching lots of
people having fun around you,

176
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,690
right? You got resolved.

177
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:40,870
The noise that early saves your health
by just being out on the street,

178
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,000
being with other people
and seeing the lights.

179
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,820
There's a kind of slight
desperation in that.

180
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,160
How can you, the lights

181
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,720
are much brighter there. You can forget
all your troubles. Forget all your care.

182
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:02,210
I liked that line. The lights
are much brighter there.

183
00:12:02,211 --> 00:12:05,230
You can forget all your troubles again,
all your care while you can't actually,

184
00:12:05,231 --> 00:12:07,120
but you can go out and try [inaudible].

185
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,430
It takes your mind off stuff.

186
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:18,210
Don't hang around and let your problems
surrounding there own movie shows want

187
00:12:18,211 --> 00:12:19,180
to go downtown.

188
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:25,140
Maybe you know some little places to
go to where they never close downtown.

189
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:30,890
[inaudible]

190
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:35,090
thank you to Alan hole and the BBC and
falling tree productions for that piece

191
00:12:35,091 --> 00:12:35,360
you note.

192
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,830
I think if our question right now is
like when a song falls from Song Heaven,

193
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,200
why does it find an audience?
Sometimes a global audience?

194
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:45,800
I think it's not really the music in
this case. I mean it's catchy. Sure.

195
00:12:45,801 --> 00:12:49,620
But the experience of going downtown
in New York and you're excited,

196
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,240
you want to see the bright lights,

197
00:12:51,241 --> 00:12:54,480
you want to be with people and
you get there and it still sucks.

198
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:58,830
You still lonely. I think people in
Shanghai understand that feeling.

199
00:12:58,831 --> 00:13:01,880
People in Bombay, everybody
knows that feeling. Yeah.

200
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,290
It's like migration music
in a way. Yeah. You know,

201
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,480
moving from one place
to a new place. Yeah,

202
00:13:06,481 --> 00:13:10,980
and there is interestingly precedent
for this 50 years before they wrote

203
00:13:10,981 --> 00:13:11,814
downtown,

204
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,600
this was already happening on a much
bigger scale than I had ever imagined.

205
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,340
Right here.

206
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:19,790
I learned about this from,
from this Guy Aaron, a Fox.

207
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:24,050
He is a professor of musicology
at Columbia University
in New York and the Damn

208
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,840
Country Western league
guitar player country,

209
00:13:26,841 --> 00:13:29,990
not that rock and roll one too deep.

210
00:13:29,991 --> 00:13:32,700
Dan and Aaron n and and
turning [inaudible].

211
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:36,590
I hear that train to come in nitro over
and round the bend country music is a

212
00:13:36,591 --> 00:13:40,670
genre we normally associate with
Kentucky and Nashville, West Virginia,

213
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:44,060
particularly part of America. Boys
pick up. Yeah, but it has spread.

214
00:13:44,061 --> 00:13:46,970
He says to the most unusual places,

215
00:13:46,971 --> 00:13:50,960
so some examples of that and there are
quite a few that include the extreme

216
00:13:50,961 --> 00:13:55,160
popularity of American country and
Western music over the last 50 or 60 years

217
00:13:55,161 --> 00:13:56,570
with aboriginal Australians.

218
00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:00,560
You mean Hank Williams
would be recognizable to
somebody somewhere in Western

219
00:14:00,561 --> 00:14:05,000
Australia? Absolutely. Really? Dolly
Parton being another one elite part.

220
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:08,630
Dolly Parton is this international
global star of the world's music,

221
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:11,080
especially in southern Africa.
She's a revered like a saint

222
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:18,420
[inaudible].

223
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,980
It's true. Zimbabwe as love. Dolly Parton,

224
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,580
you can fill the venue with a band playing
Dolly Parton song and everybody will

225
00:14:23,581 --> 00:14:24,390
know.

226
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:27,210
That was fun. Yes, doing good.
He was into that rocket job

227
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,520
and most universally
evolved. Don Williams,

228
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,590
I left Oklahoma

229
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:40,170
[inaudible] if don Williams were to go
to Dar es Salaam or to Zanzibar or to

230
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:45,090
Kenya or someplace and book a club, Don
Williams has actually gone to Zimbabwe,

231
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:50,420
uh, where he has filled a soccer stadium
with 40,000 people twice in a row. Wow.

232
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,243
[inaudible]

233
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:59,410
imagine 40 thousands and Bob Williams
crammed into a peak state and down here in

234
00:15:00,171 --> 00:15:04,570
the center and the lights
is done, we'll use Texas.

235
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,533
I just wondering

236
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,390
what exactly are they hearing?

237
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,220
I have asked Grenadian Saint Lucian
and this Trinidadians or Macon,

238
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:19,200
Norwegian [inaudible] Chinese and
American Aboriginal Australian, Thai. Um,

239
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:20,560
why do you like country music?

240
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:24,040
And the first answer is virtually
always something along the lines of,

241
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:27,100
it's the stories. Like as in
the stories in the lyrics,

242
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:32,160
I was drunk the day my mom got out of
prison and I went to pick her up and the

243
00:15:32,861 --> 00:15:33,820
rain,

244
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:38,050
but before I could get to the
station in my pickup truck,

245
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:41,410
she got run over by a
damned old train. Um,

246
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,450
that doesn't sound very aboriginal to me.

247
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,930
You know how many aborigines are
actually run over by trains. Thousands.

248
00:15:46,931 --> 00:15:49,300
Actually that's not what
Professor Fox is saying.

249
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,600
He says ignore the details and
listen for the larger story,

250
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:57,370
which has to do with moving,
with migration and with regret.

251
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:02,790
Your lonesome for something and the thing
you're missing is the old home town,

252
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:07,660
the green, green grass of home,
the green, green grass overhaul,

253
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:12,710
Aaron Foxes. You can boil much of
this music down to just this feeling.

254
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:17,120
You look and look around you
long for something simpler,

255
00:16:17,121 --> 00:16:22,121
something that used left behind and I
realized that I was only dreaming what

256
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:28,400
would be the best couple of examples
you can think of of I miss the firearm.

257
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:30,590
I miss the crickets.
Oh, where do you dark?

258
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:35,190
The first hit country song was
in a static reverie for quote

259
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:42,290
old log cabin in the lane performed by
Jimmy Rogers and Finland, John Carson.

260
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:46,580
The song was recorded in 1927 and
that happens to be the moment.

261
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:49,910
If you look at the u s census cause
he'll tell you when the United States

262
00:16:49,911 --> 00:16:54,710
crosses the threshold from more than
50% agrarian and rural dwellers to more

263
00:16:54,711 --> 00:16:59,450
than 50% urban dwellers. In other
words, country music really exploded.

264
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:03,890
And this is not an accident when most
people no longer lived in the country.

265
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,130
Country Music is born when the
country becomes an nostalgic idea.

266
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,430
And so in America anyway,

267
00:17:10,431 --> 00:17:14,780
suddenly there was this dreamscape of
country places that no longer existed

268
00:17:14,781 --> 00:17:19,050
except in heads and the
music started just been so.

269
00:17:19,051 --> 00:17:24,030
If people in Los Angeles and in
Chicago heard country in their minds,

270
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:28,290
it seems just as logical that people
who move from the country to the city in

271
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,060
Asia,

272
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:33,510
in Africa and Australia might have exactly
the same experience that these songs

273
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:34,350
are sung in English.

274
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,560
If these people in these far
away places don't speak English,

275
00:17:37,561 --> 00:17:38,580
what are they hearing? Well,

276
00:17:38,581 --> 00:17:41,580
it's important to understand English and
the real enthusiasts around the world

277
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:43,170
are English speakers. However,

278
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:47,000
one explanation for its popularity
elsewhere is that even if you don't speak

279
00:17:47,001 --> 00:17:50,340
English, the message is
literally in the music itself.

280
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:54,620
There is grammar here in the
vocalization, the singers,

281
00:17:54,621 --> 00:17:56,330
this is a very normal
country western thing.

282
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:01,160
They actually make a croaky sound
that is very distinctive. You know,

283
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,430
it's a golden goose.

284
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:09,450
Ah, oh, long day,

285
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:13,040
one of the principle vocal articulations
is what country singers call it crime

286
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:15,480
[inaudible]

287
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,990
in my book by parcel,

288
00:18:16,991 --> 00:18:20,670
the cry break into dozens of
different specific articulations.

289
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,750
[inaudible] no,

290
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,720
Eh,

291
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,850
and it's not just the voices by the way
says Fox. It's, it's the instruments.

292
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,900
Instruments seem to be crying. In fact,

293
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:36,790
the steel guitar is the signature sound
of country because it's recognized as

294
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,470
iconic of a crying human voice.

295
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,170
Hmm.

296
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,490
It's called the crying steel.

297
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:48,270
Uh, um,

298
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:50,880
you can hear the loons of there

299
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:58,740
and what seems to come rule is things
just aren't what they were before and all

300
00:19:00,011 --> 00:19:03,520
over the world where people are leaving
from the country to the city and they

301
00:19:03,521 --> 00:19:04,540
are an enormous number.

302
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:06,810
[inaudible]

303
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:10,410
this is a story. All kinds
of people can understand.

304
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,870
Country has just as much
Grenadian music as it is.

305
00:19:12,871 --> 00:19:16,290
Kentucky music is just as much a why
and music at it as it is West Virginia

306
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:17,640
music. Is that one,

307
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:21,540
when you feel a football stadium
with Dolly Parton listeners,

308
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:25,560
are we saying that they're there in
part because the song she's seen,

309
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:28,530
are there stories too? Yup.
Yup. This is our music.

310
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,640
I've written a lot of songs about
the smokey mountains where I grew up.

311
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,430
We had a good life back there and heals,

312
00:19:35,431 --> 00:19:39,000
and we're all going through
some version of, you know, oh,

313
00:19:39,001 --> 00:19:43,860
on one to two or 300 year change from
being essentially peasants to being

314
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,000
[inaudible].
