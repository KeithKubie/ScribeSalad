Emily Abt: My name is Emily Abt and I'm teaching a course called Social Issue Filmmaking.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:25.619 position:98%
Social issue films are any film that tells a story around a social issue.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:27.810 position:63%
Shikha Uberoi: Basically in twelve weeks

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.250 position:92%
we're learning to make a documentary: shoot one, write one,

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:39.249
script one. We've learned so much.

00:00:39.249 --> 00:00:45.249 position:98%
Jamie Ding: We're learning a lot of things about movies: how to make movies--

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:49.249 position:98%
the essential elements of films for both narrative and documentaries.

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.559 position:97%
Kate Germond: The chief mission of Centurion Ministries is to free wrongly convicted people.

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.000 position:97%
People who are serving life or death sentences for crimes they did not commit.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.420 position:98%
Michael was convicted of an armed robbery and murder in a small convenience store in Baltimore.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:18.420 position:97%
The description of the assailants juxtaposed to who Michael is was ridiculous. I mean,

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:25.479 position:98%
a fool–a child would have known that that mug shot is not Michael Austin.

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.590 position:98%
Michael Austin: I got off of work one night and I was informed that the police were looking for me for murder

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:36.590 position:98%
and armed robbery at the Grounds food market. That's when my whole world was turned upside down

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.969 position:98%
Every witness in the supermarket said that the guy that shot the security guard

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:48.689 position:97%
was 5'8", light-skinned with eggy hair, wore glasses, with sideburns. Why did you arrest me?

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:53.280 position:77%
Emily Abt: My students are awesome and they don't

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.259 position:97%
come from any particular discipline. I've got students who are biology majors.

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:05.460 position:97%
I've got students from the visual arts program. I'm really happy that the class attracts

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.290 position:98%
students from every discipline. They've chosen really interesting topics.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.750 position:97%
One group of students made a film about a transgender student.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.750 position:98%
Tony: Hey, my name's Tony–that's T-O-N-Y, not T-O-N-I and my last name is ____, and

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:37.520 position:97%
I identify as a trans-guy. That's me with long hair and my legal name is Antoinette,

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:44.240 position:97%
but I've never identified that way at all. You can go into the transition expecting to

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.320 position:98%
be male in two weeks, but it's a year, multi-year process and you don't really–

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:55.730 position:98%
you can't even like really pass as male until six or eight months in. I work as a legal

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:02.730 position:97%
assistant at a small LGTB civil-rights law firm so working there has been great as far

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.730 position:97%
as my transition goes. A lot of people ask "What program do you want now,"

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.270 position:98%
and "We'll support you through this." And obviously, I haven't gotten fired which is great.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:19.570 position:98%
But, yeah, I mean, trans-people in the U.S., like, there's not a lot of protection against discrimination

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.570 position:98%
Emily Abt: I think that you know, the student's diverse interests

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.480 position:98%
are reflected in their films and for me, I'm not so concerned with actual subject matter.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:41.480 position:98%
What I really wanted for them was them to have the experience of collaborating and making a film.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.000 position:88%
Shikha Uberoi: I was a producer, my friends were —one of

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.510 position:97%
them was a director, another one was a shooter —the other one was an editor, and we all took turns taking these roles.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:53.600 position:88%
Jack Thornton: I've actually learned more in this class,

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.330 position:97%
I think, than I have in any other film class I've ever taken and actually all the film

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.330 position:97%
classes I've taken altogether. So, it's been a really beneficial experience.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:15.330
[piano music]

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.560 position:97%
Andrew Wai: My name is Andrew Wai. I'm a sophomore here at Princeton University thinking about

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.680 position:97%
studying politics and possibly going for the certificate in political economy.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:32.680 position:97%
The condition that I have is called Leber's congenital amaurosis. It prevents the synthesis of certain

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:39.940 position:98%
factors that allow retinal cells to live and that in the absence of this factor they slowly

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.250 position:97%
die. So, when I was young I had much better vision than I have today. As time went on,

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.100 position:98%
the more and more retinal cells died and my vision has gotten worse and worse since then.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:55.610 position:98%
Essentially I'm confined to light perception —sort of which direction light is coming from.

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:02.610 position:98%
That's pretty much it. I never was able to see color, so I have no real understanding of color I guess.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:10.340 position:98%
Pretty much now, I can use it (my vision) to tell me which direction light is coming from. And that's about it.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.280 position:97%
Emily Abt: It was very important to me that I give the students some hands-on experience because

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:21.110 position:98%
I think the best way to learn how to make films is by making films.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.920 position:94%
Jack Thornton: I wanted to be a filmmaker before this class,

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.920 position:98%
but this class has just definitely spurred me on and inspired me to continue that path even more.
