00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 in this capsule we will see how to comment 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.120
 what we can represent an image in 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.719
 a computer as part of a system 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.610
 computer vision 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:13.830
 gold we distinguish two bodies the first 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.830
 it's the one of images in levels of 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.170
 gray so black and white 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.449
 so in this case also an image like 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.490
 this one here we go there represented as 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.670
 a two-dimensional array so having 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.519
 two indices' the index of the row and 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.820
 column index for pixels 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.100
 in the picture and at each element of 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.100
 table in fact we see there associates a 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.620
 8-bit positive integer that actually goes 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.129
 given information on the intensity of 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:48.270
 pixel so at 0 it will match a 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:51.660
 pixel that is in black then to more 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.520
 the error is high plus the pixel goes 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.579
 get closer to white so we see by 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.059
 example at 191 on the pixel that is 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.219
 almost white so pixels totally 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.480
 saturated so totally white can have 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.510
 a value in this case also because we 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.979
 had 8 bits of 255 one sees for 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.920
 intermediate values â€‹â€‹to the data of the 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.200
 different gurit levels and so I 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.710
 recalls that the first clue in this 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.729
 case vote is the row and the 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.189
 second index will match the 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.100
 column so this is one of the ways to 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.140
 represent the images so 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.970
 important by the computer this is a 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.829
 way of representing it that is often 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.280
 actually used in systems of 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.280
 computer vision 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.979
 but in sound and images that are not 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.720
 in black and white but which are rather in 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.829
 colors in this case also make it see 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.689
 table in three dimensions or what we 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.180
 going to have is that each pixel rather 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.649
 than to be described by a single integer 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.079
 8-bit positive 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.659
 we will describe by three positive integer 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.899
 which will correspond to three channels their 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.060
 canoe red cannon towards and during the 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.850
 red channel canada and the blue channel 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.490
 so in this case we go components 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.369
 makes each color in intensity for 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.220
 the intensity of the red channel of the canal 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.270
 green and blue channel so both 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.440
 first clues are always going 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.840
 corresponds to the position 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.540
 and then the last clue you 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.340
 correspond for the first element to 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.069
 red duck the second the green the 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.790
 third blue and there are others 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:30.310
 ways to break down a color at 1.3 to 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.170
 three channels a media what if the one that 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.030
 we will consider who is perhaps the 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:40.209
 most popular is the one with 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:41.920
 rgb channels so already with this 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.290
 representation there finally we could 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.299
 develop vision systems by 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.130
 computer for example that we could 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.440
 to do is we could take a 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.739
 picture x which corresponds to our table 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.080
 of pixels we could convert it into a 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.269
 vector little hic what in what if 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.110
 match the image but we would put 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:03.819
 the pixels into one in a table 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.290
 of a single dimension so in 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.760
 converting two dimensions into one 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.250
 only pair by ranking the pixels in 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:13.900
 some to the pope for example in a 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:16.030
 order by row and one could 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.850
 give this picture there is a collection 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.530
 of picture to be hardened learning for 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.359
 try to learn something to 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.230
 from this raw representation of 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:27.370
 images against it is so there is 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.739
 a lot of research work going on 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.780
 are doing from this representation 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:34.840
 we are going to say gross of the image then 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.970
 try to solve different age of 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.970
 computer vision 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:42.340
 these while some problems 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.870
 except representation there a first 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.180
 it's a representation that 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.880
 is heavy in terms of memory so on 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.440
 the 1024 by 1024 pixels which is more 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.180
 in fact only in the images demonstrated 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.819
 previously we had very little crisis 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.850
 and we had images of 28 by 28 and 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.709
 in black and white then 32 by 32 years in 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.880
 colors but typically we can 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.150
 easily have pictures a lot 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.400
 bigger reason of 1024 1024 and if 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.710
 we have 8 bits per pixel for the level 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.540
 gray it gives about 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:15.430
 1 but gbagbo is an experienced man 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:18.820
 and then if we had 24 24 bits instead 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.890
 yes so 3 x 8 bits for all three 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.810
 channels and we end up with rather 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.970
 three guys by picture 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.620
 so that's a first problem 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.860
 potential that this representation 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.680
 then the second son is that well 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.150
 often it contains a lot more 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.460
 information that what we need 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.940
 for an application of his wishes 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.890
 detect the cars in the pictures the 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.320
 color is not particularly useful 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.610
 in fact it's mostly the form of 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.520
 the object that will determine if a car 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.890
 or not and if we detect an object in 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.250
 general in fact all that is there it's 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.940
 we or if we want the background 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.850
 releasing the scene in which 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.580
 the object may be ignored for 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.980
 identify the identity of the object one 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:06.400
 try to detect then what can 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.990
 to do is we will see you some 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.030
 operations that we will say good level 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.940
 so applied directly to the images 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.890
 gross who are going to be relatively 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.570
 simple but that we will be able to 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.940
 pretreatments on the images that are going 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.810
 extract the information can be more 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.340
 relevant 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.800
 so he's going to highlight 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.200
 the most interesting information for 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.500
 solve different vision problems 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.500
 by computer
