00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.190
To solve this problem by multiplication
you do not multiply by 12,

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.840
not really at least,
you actually multiply by 1.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:12.042
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:12.042 --> 00:00:14.580
Because multiplying by 1
never changes our number.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.554
3 cartons times 1.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:18.930
So what next?

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.840
Well I have a very special version
of 1 that I'd like to use,

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.600
one that we just came up with.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.290
12 eggs divided by 1 carton, and

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.295
I'm free to do this because hey,
this is equal to 1.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.720
And now something interesting happens.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.730
Because cartons is up here and carton is
down here, it's like a common factor.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.910
And common factors simplify,
they cancel out.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.380
Now what I'm left with is 3
times 12 eggs, divided by 1.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.770
Well division by 1 never changes
anything, so let's just get rid of that.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.599
And 3 times 12.

00:00:57.599 --> 00:01:00.757
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:00.757 --> 00:01:01.880
That's just 36.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.470
So 3 kinds of eggs is
really equal to 36 eggs.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.610
And we got it by multiplying by 1,
or a special version of 1.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.850
And we call that version
a conversion factor.
