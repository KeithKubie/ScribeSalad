00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.110
We're asked to simplify the
cube root of 27a squared times

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.590
b to the fifth times
c to the third power.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.090
And the goal, whenever
you try to just simplify

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.940
a cube root like
this, is we want

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.430
to look at the parts of
this expression over here

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.660
that are perfect cubes,
that are something

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.170
raised to the third power.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.190
Then we can take just
the cube root of those,

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.579
essentially taking them
out of the radical sign,

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:26.120
and then leaving
everything else that

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.930
is not a perfect
cube inside of it.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.390
So let's see what we can do.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.410
So first of all, 27--
you may or may not

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.350
already recognize this
as a perfect cube.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.800
If you don't already
recognize it,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.508
you can actually do
a prime factorization

00:00:36.508 --> 00:00:38.040
and see it's a perfect cube.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.070
27 is 3 times 9,
and 9 is 3 times 3.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.990
So 27-- its prime factorization
is 3 times 3 times 3.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.780
So it's the exact same thing
as 3 to the third power.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.860
So let's rewrite this
whole expression down here.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.140
But let's write it in terms of
things that are perfect cubes

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.098
and things that aren't.

00:00:57.098 --> 00:01:01.900
So 27 can be just rewritten
as 3 to the third power.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.710
Then you have a squared--
clearly not a perfect cube.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.150
a to the third would have been.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.617
So we're just going
to write this--

00:01:08.617 --> 00:01:09.700
let me write it over here.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.050
We can switch the order
here because we just

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.750
have a bunch of things being
multiplied by each other.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.470
So I'll write the a
squared over here.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.590
b to the fifth is not a
perfect cube by itself,

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.580
but it can be expressed
as the product

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.600
of a perfect cube and
another thing. b to the fifth

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.240
is the exact same thing as
b to the third power times

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.427
b to the second power.

00:01:31.427 --> 00:01:33.510
If you want to see that
explicitly, b to the fifth

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.800
is b times b times
b times b times b.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.810
So the first three are
clearly b to the third power.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.400
And then you have b to
the second power after it.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.850
So we can rewrite b to
the fifth as the product

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.680
of a perfect cube.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.542
So I'll write b
to the third-- let

00:01:51.542 --> 00:01:54.340
me do that in that
same purple color.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.540
So we have b to the
third power over here.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.620
And then it's b to the
third times b squared.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.310
So I'll write the b
squared over here.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.851
And we're assuming we're going
to multiply all of this stuff.

00:02:03.851 --> 00:02:08.029
And then finally, we
have-- I'll do in blue-- c

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:09.190
to the third power.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.205
Clearly, this is a perfect cube.

00:02:11.205 --> 00:02:12.850
It is c cubed.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.030
It is c to the third power.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.090
So I'll put it over here.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.960
So this is c to the third power.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.680
And of course, we still have
that overarching radical sign.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.770
So we're still trying to take
the cube root of all of this.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.640
And we know from our
exponent properties,

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.630
or we could say from
our radical properties,

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.071
that this is the
exact same thing.

00:02:31.071 --> 00:02:33.070
That taking the cube root
of all of these things

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.880
is the same as
taking the cube root

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.230
of these individual factors
and then multiplying them.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.739
So this is the same
thing as the cube root--

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.530
and I could separate
them out individually.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.970
Or I could say the cube
root of 3 to the third b

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.280
to the third c to the third.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.636
Actually, let's do it both ways.

00:02:48.636 --> 00:02:50.010
So I'll take them
out separately.

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.000
So this is the same thing
as the cube root of 3

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.730
to the third times the cube
root-- I'll write them all in.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.120
Let me color-code it so we don't
get confused-- times the cube

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:08.840
root of b to the third
times the cube root of c

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.430
to the third times
the cube root--

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.900
and I'll just group
these two guys

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.680
together just because we're not
going to be able to simplify it

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.919
any more-- times the cube
root of a squared b squared.

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:24.710
I'll keep the colors
consistent while we're

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.740
trying to figure
out what's what.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.950
And I could have said that
this is times the cube

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.150
root of a squared times
the cube root of b squared,

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.524
but that won't
simplify anything,

00:03:33.524 --> 00:03:35.350
so I'll just leave
these like this.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.070
And so we can look at
these individually.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.970
The cube root of 3 to the
third, or the cube root of 27--

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.000
well, that's clearly
just going to be-- I

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.360
want to do that in
that yellow color--

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.686
this is clearly
just going to be 3.

00:03:46.686 --> 00:03:49.260
3 to the third power is
3 to the third power,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.850
or it's equal to 27.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.180
This term right over
here, the cube root

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.820
of b to the third--
well, that's just b.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.160
And the cube root
of c to the third,

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.050
well, that is
clearly-- I want to do

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.990
that in that-- that
is clearly just c.

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:12.560
So our whole expression has
simplified to 3 times b times

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:20.430
c times the cube root
of a squared b squared.

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:27.837
And we're done.

00:04:27.837 --> 00:04:29.420
And I just want to
do one other thing,

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.370
just because I did mention
that I would do it.

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.790
We could simplify it this way.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.420
Or we could recognize that
this expression right over here

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:43.714
can be written as 3bc
to the third power.

00:04:43.714 --> 00:04:45.630
And if I take three
things to the third power,

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:46.930
and I'm multiplying it,
that's the same thing

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.699
as multiplying them
first and then raising

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:49.490
to the third power.

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.620
It comes straight out of
our exponent properties.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.960
And so we can rewrite
this as the cube

00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:01.580
root of all of this times
the cube root of a squared b

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:02.701
squared.

00:05:02.701 --> 00:05:04.200
And so the cube
root of all of this,

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.890
of 3bc to the third power, well,
that's just going to be 3bc,

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.742
and then multiplied by the cube
root of a squared b squared.

00:05:11.742 --> 00:05:13.950
I didn't take the trouble
to color-code it this time,

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.910
because we already figured
out one way to solve it.

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.451
But hopefully, that
also makes sense.

00:05:17.451 --> 00:05:19.940
We could have done
this either way.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.603
But the important thing is
that we get that same answer.
