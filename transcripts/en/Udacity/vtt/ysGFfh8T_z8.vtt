00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.639
Let's look at the solution to our
2-way set-associative cache quiz.

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:08.063
As before, the answer to this
type of question requires us to

00:00:08.063 --> 00:00:13.200
figure out which bits in the address
determine what in the cache.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.350
So the address will be broken
into offset, in this case 5 bits,

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.610
index, in this case, two bits to tell
us which set we have, and a tack,

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.920
seven bits are used by the index,
and the offset, with means,

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.330
that the index will be determined by
the least significant two digits.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:40.580
So we can figure out
that 0003 is like this.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.150
Five bits are the off set,
the next two bits are the index.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:50.330
So this maps to set zero,
and we will put F303 there.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.330
Next one is F503.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.960
It maps to the same set but
this set now has two places,

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:05.550
so we can actually put F503 in
the other line in that set.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:06.620
Next, we have F563.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.440
6, 3 is like this.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.600
This maps to set number 3,
and finally EF63,

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.880
is going to map to the same set,
and we'll put it here.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.420
So as you can see, with the 2-way set
associative cache, we can put more than

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.780
one block that maps to the same place
in the cache and not have conflicts.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.130
This is why we want to
have a 2-way cache or

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.970
more because it reduces
the number of conflicts.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.180
However, it complicates the tagged
checks because now when

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.030
we're looking for something we
have two places to search before

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.440
we're sure whether it's there or not.
