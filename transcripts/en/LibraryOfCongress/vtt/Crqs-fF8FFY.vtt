&gt;&gt; Narrator: From the Library
of Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.930
&gt;&gt; Roberta I.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.230
Shaffer: Good evening, my
name is Roberta Shaffer,

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.680
and I have the absolute
pleasure of serving

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.350
as the 24th Law Librarian
of Congress.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.820
Tonight is a particularly
exciting evening for me,

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.370
because it represents the really
bringing to fruition a discussion

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.800
and a dream that Rob Casper
and I had about five years ago,

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.480
about somehow marrying law and
poetry; law and literature.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.400 position:56%
And my dream at the time -- although
I never shared this with Rob

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.950 position:56%
or my cartoon balloon at the time --
was to totally redefine the concept

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.250
of poetic justice [background
laughter].

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.120
And so I hope that we will
be able to do that tonight.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.340
Because there is something
very, very important

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.360
about the sibling relationship
between law and poetry.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:22.160
And in fact, Attica Locke, the 2016
recipient of the Harper Lee prize

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.940
for fiction, has said that "Law

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.410
and literature are
really fraternal twins."

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.650
And surely we can see that
they share the womb of words

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.820
in both an oral and
a written tradition.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.790
But law and poetry, and law and
literature find common ground

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.540 position:56%
in their reliance upon storytelling.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.140
In their heavy use of
analogy and metaphor.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.450
In their conviction for form
and format, which they then love

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.040
to take great liberties with.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.330
The reliance upon history
and precedent.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.470
And let's not forget
the heavy use of fiction

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.620
in both disciplines
[background laughter].

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:10.320
The immortal Shelly provides some
conformation in what I call an

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.900
"Early amicus brief
to civilization".

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.210
His 1821 defense of
poetry -- a legal term --

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:25.570
calls poets the "unacknowledged
legislatures of the world".

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:31.380
And in a more contemporary
setting, the poet and songwriter,

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.740 position:56%
Leonard Cohen, who is now ultimately
legitimated by the Nobel Prize

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:42.070
to Bob Dylan, calls poetry
"the evidence of life".

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.790
So before I turn the podium over
to the true stars of the evening,

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.590
I just want to make
some acknowledgements.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.730
And the first is to my wonderful,
extraordinary colleague Rob Casper.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.750
The head of the Poetry
and Literature Center.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.910
He wears, in my mind,
the triple crown.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.800
He is a colleague extraordinaire.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.870
He is an incredibly cool
guy [background laughter].

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.040
And he is so, so creative.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:19.110
Let me also do a callout to our new
head of the center for the book,

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.720
Pam Jackson, who is
sitting in the audience.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.400
The center for the book --

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.260
the Poetry and Literature
Center is nested

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.150
within the center for the book.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.790 position:56%
A perfectly wonderful pairing again.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.490
But let me just conclude by saying
that our goal for this evening is

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.770
to provide clear and convincing
evidence [background laughter],

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.830 position:56%
beyond a reasonable thought that law

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.160
and poetry share so
much in their DNA.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.670
And together they enrich the world.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.030
Indeed, they are wonderful
conspirators in helping us

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.000
to better understand
our current times.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.040
And then help us to transfer
the enormous knowledge assets

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.720
that we will leave as
a legacy to the future.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.130
So with that, I welcome
Rob to the podium.

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.510
Thank you so much for being here.

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:22.110
[ Applause ]

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:27.590
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Wow I have a more
prosaic introduction to make

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:33.120
after that wonderfully
lyrical welcome by Roberta.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.120
I should say that five
years ago I remember going

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.790 position:56%
to the Lollybrain's [phonetic]office
and talking about a possibility

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.860 position:56%
of a program with Roberta and Robert
Newlan [phonetic] who's now our

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.690
Chief of Staff at the library.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.560
And afterwards calling my dad
up who is a small-town lawyer

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.950 position:56%
in Wisconsin saying, "I just met
the law librarian in the Law Library

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.250
of Congress; we're
going to do something.

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.180
And I'm happy now we can tell him

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.060
that we actually finally
did [background laughter].

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.840
With the proper pair, it really
took the right pair of people

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.510
to get this program off the ground.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.760
So before we begin, let me tell
you to turn off your cell phones

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.820
or any electronic devices
that you have

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.790 position:56%
that might interfere with the event.

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.320
Second, please note that this
record is being recorded.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.650
And by participating in the Q &amp;
A session, you give us permission

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.880
for future use of this recording.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.610
This is the kind of event
we're really excited

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.390
about having a webcast to let the
whole world know about the ways

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.950
in which we're thinking
about law and literature.

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.550
Finally, let me tell
you a little bit

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.470
about the Poetry and
Literature Center.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.950 position:56%
We are home to the US Poet Laureate.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.210
The Poet Laureate Consult of
Poetry established by a law --

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.730
an act of Congress in 1985.

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:49.040
And we put on 30 to 40 programs
like this throughout the year.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.810
To find out more about
our literary programs,

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.530
you can sign on our sign-up
sheet which is in the foyer

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.300
and we'll send you emails
about what's coming up.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:05.430
You can also visit our
website, www.lsc.gov/poetry.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:06.730
There we go.

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.190
So let me tell you a little bit

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:14.090
about how tonight's
event's going to work.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.320
First, Monica Youn
will read from her book

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.030
and discuss her book, "Black Acre".

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.380
It's her newest book of poetry.

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:27.720
Then as you'll see, Martha Dragich,
the Emerita Professor of Law,

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.130
from the University of Missouri
will give a presentation

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.830
about teaching law and literature
in her many years as a professor.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.900
And then they will both come
up on stage to participate

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.620
in a moderated discussion,
and we'll have time

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.200
for your questions afterwards.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:47.080
We also have copies of "Black
Acre" for sale in the back.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.440
I hope you buy a copy and
get Monica to sign it.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.140
You can read more about both of
our participants in the program

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:59.070
that should be on your
chair or next to you.

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:03.180
But let me say how much I
appreciate their willingness

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:04.910
to bring this event to life.

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.210
I've known Monica for
a good, long time.

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:11.380
We're New York buddies, and I
talk to her often about her work

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.890
as a poet and as an attorney.

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:17.570
No one I know is more capable
of connecting these two worlds

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:20.540
with an understanding of what
contemporary poetry is doing.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:24.940
And her new book exemplifies
how poetry can employ concepts

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:29.450
such as the legal fiction of "Black
Acre" to powerfully personal ends.

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:30.750
I look forward to both

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:34.670
of our featured speakers
begin this conversation

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:36.220
about law and literature.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:40.510
So please join me in welcoming
Monica Youn and Martha Dragich.

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:45.510
[ Applause ]

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:51.390
[ Background Room Sounds ]

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:52.690
&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: Thank you.

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:55.320 position:56%
Rob had asked me a couple of minutes
ago whether this was the first time

00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:00.540
I had read in a law library and I
had to tell him, "Of course it is."

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:01.840
I mean the law library --

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.300
law libraries don't usually
host poetry readings.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:08.130
And also, it's I think maybe
the time I felt my legal career

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:11.300
and my poetic career come together
most strongly, because I'm staying

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:15.670
at the same hotel that I would
always stay in as a lawyer

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:18.140
when I would come here
to lobby on Capitol Hill

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:22.380
or to attend oral argument
at the Supreme Court.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:26.070
And so it's -- to be here as a
poet rather than as a lawyer.

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:28.830
To be staying, you know, and
eating at the corner bakery

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:32.890
around [background laughter], is
really very interesting to me.

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:36.130
So I'm going to -- you know, I'm
really looking forward to kind

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:39.790
of getting a conversation
started, and some thinking started

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:42.190
about the relationship
between law and literature.

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:43.820
And, you know, and you know,

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:48.400 position:56%
I guess my bailiwick would be the
relationship between law and poetry.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.860
And so I was going to start
off with some shorter poems

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:56.360
that employ some legal
settings; legal concepts.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.770
This first one is called
"Sunrise Foley Square".

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:03.500
Foley Square will be familiar
to anyone who's ever litigated

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:08.640
in New York as the setting of the
state and federal court houses.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:13.220 position:56%
And will also be familiar to fans
of "NYPD Blue" [background laughter]

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:16.790
because it's where the
opening credits are shot.

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:20.300
And this poem was set -- you
know, it's an odd little poem.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.270
And I'm not quite sure
whether it succeeds.

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:25.770
It's a poem that's
notable for absence.

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:29.730
Because it was written
when, you know,

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:32.960
when the Ferguson protests
were taking place,

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:36.410
and my son had literally
just been born,

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:38.080 position:56%
I mean he was a couple of weeks old.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.390
I was in that, you
know, new parent haze

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:42.090
of nursing him around the clock.

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:45.370
And we live only a couple
of blocks from Foley Square,

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:48.540
which is where a lot of these
protests were gathering.

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:52.650
And so pretty much this sort of
around the clock of, you know,

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:55.830
of taking care of this
newborn coincided

00:09:55.830 --> 00:10:02.120
with around the clock
helicopters, sirens, and chants.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.900
And, you know, and one
morning, you know, before --

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:09.470
right around sunrise I noticed
that all of the noise had stopped.

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:16.660 position:56%
And I was thinking about the absence
of that noise, and also how kind

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.960
of the expectation that
there was always going

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:24.200
to be another name added
to the list of those --

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:28.090
of those who had been
killed by police violence.

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:31.870
And so this poem contains a blank,

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:35.120
which I'll just kind of
indicate by stopping.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.930
"Sunrise Foley Square."

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:42.310
"One siren stained the
morning in concentric rings.

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:44.010
Another starts up.

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:45.860
Stops. Starts again.

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:49.840
Stops. Little chips of sound,
like a climber's hammer.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:53.550
Testing for handholds on
an upward-sloping face.

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:57.670
Daylight floods the
soundscape with clear liquid.

00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:58.970
Thickening.

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:01.260
Flowing over and around.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:07.690
A lack that could be displaced,
but not entirely dispersed.

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:10.480
An air bubble trapped
in rubber tubing.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.040
Something cone shaped;
nearly discernable.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.950
Starting to resemble a cry."

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:23.240
And this poem is also -- and
we have a handout of this poem,

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.540
which we'll discuss a bit later.

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.840
This poem is also structured
around absence.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.870
It's called, "Landscape
with Dayadand" [phonetic].

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:31.560
And I was a, you know, in
law school I was a huge --

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:36.680
even before law school actually, I
was an enormous legal history geek.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:40.340
My favorite class in college was
British Constitutional History

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:44.230
from 1060 -- from 1066 to 1688.

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:46.000
And, you know, and I took as much

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.450
like very early English
legal history as I could.

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:50.980
And so a dayadand,
on Old English law,

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:52.760
is kind of this fascinating thing.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:56.570
It is the instrumentality
of a death.

00:11:56.570 --> 00:12:01.300
So if a tree branch falls off you
-- falls off a tree and hits you,

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.050
then the tree branch is a dayadand.

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:07.190
If a wagon kills you, then
the wagon is the dayadand.

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:09.490
You know, if a donkey
kills you, then you know,

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:10.790
the donkey is the dayadand.

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:14.200
And under the law of dayadands
-- there was a law for this --

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:19.400
all dayadands were forfeit to the
crown and were usually destroyed.

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:24.060
In this odd, sort of
-- you know, end.

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:26.940
So this is a landscape
with dayadand.

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:32.110
"A road in the trees
from the sound of it.

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:36.940
A milky shift in the water
where the silt shelves down.

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:40.010
And the wet branch,
beating for its life

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:42.600
against the pages of that book."

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:47.080 position:56%
So you can chew on that for a while,
and we'll discuss it later [laughs].

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:53.530
And then the title poem -- the
title sequence of the book --

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:55.160
the title of the book
is "Black Acre".

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.720
And those of you who are --

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.890
who attended law school

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:02.570
in the Anglo-American tradition
probably know that Black Acre --

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:05.350
and those -- for those of you
non-lawyers in the room --

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:09.050
Black Acre is a legal placeholder
term for a piece of property

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:13.840 position:56%
or an estate, the way John Doe is a
legal placeholder term for a person.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:17.060
So often times in your
property law class, and trust

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:21.390
and estates you'll get, you know,
John Doe transfers his property,

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:24.970
Black Acre to Jane
Roe in consideration

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:27.280
for her property, White Acre.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.850
And there's a kind of
sequence to the hypothetical.

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:33.650
So it'll just spin out as, Black
Acre, White Acre, Blue Acre,

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:38.370
Green Acre, Brown Acre -- I
added Red Acre and Gold Acre just

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:40.190
because I could [laughs].

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:42.630
Poetic license, you know?

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:45.360
And so I thought -- and
I was thinking about --

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:49.700
I used the thought of the acre
to think about what is given

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:51.200
and what is transformable.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.240
A piece of land is an
interesting metaphor.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.730
Because you have a
certain pied of land

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:56.350
and there are things
you can do with it.

00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:58.930
You could sell it to a
shopping mall developer.

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:00.230
You could build a house.

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:01.590
You can plant a garden.

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:03.090
You can make a home.

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:05.200
You could dig a grave.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.080
You could make it into your legacy.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.230
But there are certain things
you can transform about it;

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:11.710
there are certain things you
cannot transform about it.

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:15.230
At some point in dealing with
a piece of land, you know,

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:19.420
what we are allotted, we come up
against the concept of the given.

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:21.800
You know, what cannot
be transformed.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:27.280
And what we pass on to
those who come after us.

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:30.660
And so I was -- you know, a
lot of these acre poems ended

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:35.570
up being works of art,
or landscapes.

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:38.500
What in poetry is called
an acrostic poem.

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:42.930 position:56%
You know, ways in which we can think
of these mini landscapes as types

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:46.900
of -- as pieces of land that
can or cannot be transformed.

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:50.460
So this first mini landscape
will be familiar to you all.

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:54.930
It is the back of the $1 bill,
which has the Latin motto,

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:59.000
"annuit coeptis", which is a phrase
from Virgil's "Gorgics" about,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.610
you know, I think -- I can't
even remember, but like --

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:07.280
oh God, I'm going to have
to look up the translation.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:11.920
I got very little -- yes, it's
"He favors our undertaking".

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:16.600
So -- and it references
the myth of cadmos.

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.540
A cadmos, for those of you
who are mythology buffs,

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:21.910 position:56%
is the legendary founder of thieves.

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:27.760
So his sister, Europa, is
kidnapped by Zeus, the white bull.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.020
And so he goes off looking
for her, and he completely --

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:35.070
and he fails to find her, but
instead he decides to found a city.

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:36.660
He's told by an oracle to do this.

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:40.290
And so he kills a dragon, and
he sews the dragon's teeth

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:43.280 position:56%
in the ground -- this might be
starting to sound a little familiar.

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.370
And these armed men spring up.

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:48.070
And the -- and he doesn't --
he's afraid of the armed men,

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:50.170
so he throws a rock
into their midst.

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:53.740
And I'm kind of using this to
think about the way in which --

00:15:53.740 --> 00:16:00.140
the unthinking way in which we want
money to be fruitful; to multiply.

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:03.420
The judge I clerked for was
obsessed with the notion of usury.

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:06.920
An sort of, so am I.

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.240
Green acre.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:14.830 position:56%
But what if a given surface is
coaxed into fruitfulness wrongfully?

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:17.760
For instance, this
lushly verdant plane.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:20.680
Imagine it dialed back
to featurelessness.

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.360
Each spiraling stock retracted.

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.690
Each filigree rosette
slow-blinking shut.

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:30.990
Dialed back to bare promise;
to smooth napped expanse.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:35.240
The forehead of an alien princess
might convey such tranquility.

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.540
She surveys her ranks of suitors.

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:42.320
Shakes her exquisite green head
in scarcely feigned regret.

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:45.920
So thinks Cadmos, hands
still outstretched

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.190
in a nation-building gesture.

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:50.760
As if to freeze in
time this instant.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.120
Scatter of seeds still aloft.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:56.220
Arrayed like little dive
bombers information.

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:58.710
Not yet puncturing the land.

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:00.040
Not yet rooting.

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:04.900 position:56%
Not yet sending up terribly thin,
ambitious tendrils toward the light.

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:07.770
Not yet trained onto
wire frame espaliers.

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:11.000
Not combed into bombastic
pompadours.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.810
Not yet extruding seed pods
resembling pale grapes;

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:16.600
resembling pearls.

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:23.080
The root of remorse isn't tooth,
he recalls abruptly, but to bite

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:29.800
and then stoops, groping for
the biggest rock he can find.

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:35.040
Here a Brown Acre is
just a landscape.

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.340
Brown Acre.

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:41.950
"After the clear plastic sheeting
has been pulled back; folded away.

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:45.650
After each woody rhizome has
been pried loose from the soil.

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:49.420
Each snarl of root traced
to its capillary ends.

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:51.960
Twigs and petals tossed aside.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.600
Worms reburied elsewhere.

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.860
After the soil has been
rubbed through a sieve.

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:02.180
After the ground has been leveled
with rakes and stakes and string,

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:05.680
no need for further
labor; further motion.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.710
Nothing has been sewn.

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:10.710
Nothing is germinating
in the raw dirt.

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:14.880
The light strikes each
granule the same as any other.

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:19.450
A windlessness rises;
becomes a precondition.

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:23.800
Why is it hard to admit
you couldn't live here?

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.890
No one could live here.

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:28.330 position:56%
This is not the texture of the real.

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:31.870
Lacking attachment; lacking event.

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:35.110
This is neither landscape
nor memory.

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:36.530
This is parable.

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:38.630
A caricature of restraint.

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:41.790
But why does this shame you?

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:45.440
Even now you're trying to hide
that your gaze is drifting upward.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.510
This plainness cannot
hold your attention.

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:52.690
You're searching the sky for
some marker of time; of change.

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:55.760
In a cloudless sky
the sun beats down.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.710
But if you observe that
the sun warms the soil.

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:02.880
You must also concede that
the soil will grow colder.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.720
The sun stains only the body.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:09.160
And the body is what is
simply not an issue here."

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:14.920
And then this is another
poem called "Brown Acre",

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:21.790
which I think is pretty
straight forward.

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:23.720
"Brown Acre".

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:26.550
"We were sitting, leaning
back against the house

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:29.070
on the stone patio or terrace.

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:32.230
Looking out over a steep
drop at the mountains arrayed

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:34.300
in a semicircle around us.

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:39.590 position:56%
All expectant angles, like the
music stands of an absent orchestra.

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:43.620
Summer colors; orangey
golds and dims blues.

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:45.790
And there must've been
greens as well.

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:48.270
I wasn't paying attention.

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:51.730
I was watching the thing
you had just said to me,

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:54.590 position:56%
still hanging in the air between us.

00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:59.310
Its surfaces beading up with
a shiny liquid-like contempt.

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:02.780
That might have been seeping
from the words themselves,

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:06.800
or else condensing from the
air its inscrutable humidity.

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.880
The droplets rounding
themselves as they fall.

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:12.990
Edging a darker patch
on the patio tiles.

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:16.710
A deepening concavity, and
above it a roughness in the air.

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:20.700
The molecules of concrete
coalescing grain-by-grain

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.840
into a corrugated pillar
topped by a cloud.

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:28.150
A tree form, not a
sapling or a mountain tree.

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:31.980
But a tree that would look at
home in a farmyard or a meadow.

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:33.600
Sheltered from winds.

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:37.710
Branches stretching out with all
confidence toward the horizon.

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:42.640
A shape that should have been an
emblem of sufficiency; of calm.

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:46.390
But whose surfaces were teaming
with a turbulent rush of particles,

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:49.190
like the inner workings
of a throat exposed.

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:52.390
And whose dimensions were
expanding with shocking speed.

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:53.830
Accumulating mass.

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:56.630
Accumulating coherence
and righteousness.

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:59.100
Pulling more and more of
the disintegrating teras

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:02.630
into its form taller than
us, then shadowing us,

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:05.320
and doubtlessly underground
a root system

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.940
of corresponding complexity
and spread.

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:10.480
Was funneling down
displaced nothingness

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.000
from a hole in the upper air.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.580 position:56%
And then it was time, and I stood up
and went inside and shut the door.

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:21.170
Unsure what still anchored
us to the mountainside."

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:26.460
And I'll end with this.

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:29.840
This is a strange poem.

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:32.380
It's basically -- I think
like a lot of poems;

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:34.450
like a lot of legal
opinions, it brings a lot

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:36.010
of contradictory things together.

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:41.640
So partially, a memory
from junior high school

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:45.120
where a Twinkie [background
laughter],

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:48.060
we had come to understand,
or we were told,

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:50.070
was not a baked good
[background laughter].

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:53.230
It was -- actually, you know,
what we were told was it was

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:58.340
like this kind of tube of paste
that was extruded, and then exposed

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:01.370
to some sort of catalyzing
chemical so it'd grow this kind

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:04.850
of golden foamy outer layer, right?

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:08.480
You know, and then they sort of
tinted the bottom of it brown

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:11.800
with some tints of some kind
to make it appear baked.

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:15.470
And this is what I believed for
decades [background laughter].

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:18.150
Up until a couple of years
ago, actually [laughs].

00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:19.920
You know, I just thought, "Oh,
okay it's not a baked good.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.170
That's why its shelf
life is so long."

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:25.540
And unfortunately, this
turned out not to be true.

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:28.930
But, you know, Gold Acre
is also, you know, acre --

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:32.670
when you're thinking of acre
legacy, you're also you know,

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:34.420
obviously thinking about identity.

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:36.260
You're also, you know, obviously
thinking about identity.

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:37.560
You're thinking specifically
about race.

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:42.360
And as I have a son and I'm
thinking of raising him,

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.030
you know, as a Korean-American.

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:47.090
And I think, well, you know, as
an immigrant who was born here,

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:50.990
my own relationship to
being Korean-American is not

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:52.730
exactly authentic.

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:54.240
I don't speak the language.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.730
I'm not the person who can tell
you what the best thing to order

00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:59.800
on the menu is at every
Korean restaurant.

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.810
You know, and what does it
mean to be, you know -- ?

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:05.630 position:56%
So that made me think of the other
junior high school sense of Twinkie,

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:09.480
which is someone yellow on the
outside and white on the inside.

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:11.980
I think, you know,
lawyers might enjoy --

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:15.750
lawyers are always grammar nerds,
so the other thing to notice

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:18.700
about this poem is it's all cast
in the subjunctive, you know?

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:20.000
The "as if it were".

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.730
The subjunctive is the mode
in which we express fantasy

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:27.300
or the improbable.

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:31.480
And one interesting thing about the
English language in particular is,

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.940
our fantasy mode is
often indistinguishable

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:35.550
from the past tense.

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:39.660
So it's, you know, you -- so
sometimes we often tend to think

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:44.020
of the past as if it were our --
you know, the past becomes a kind

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:47.570
of fantasy, and often
a racial fantasy.

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:50.230
"Gold Acre".

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:55.590
"As if you were ever wide-eyed
enough to believe in urban legends.

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:59.510

weren't the stalest of clichés.

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:07.500
The chemical infused fog.

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:10.280
As if every origin's
story didn't center

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:14.480
on the same sweet myth
of a lost wholeness.

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:19.940
As if such longing would seem more
palatable if packaged as nostalgia.

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:24.570
As if inner and outer were merely
phases of the same substance.

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:28.850
As if this whiteness had
been your original condition.

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:31.810
As if it hadn't been
what is piped into you.

00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:34.130
What seeped into each vacant cell.

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:36.730
Each pore.

As if you had started out skinless.

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:40.570
Shameless.

Blameless.

Quivering with volatility
in a metal mold.

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:53.850
As if a catalyzing vapor
triggered a latent reaction.

00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:55.600
As if your flesh foamed

00:24:55.600 --> 00:25:01.210
up a hydrogenated emulsion
consisting mostly of trapped air.

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:06.710

remain shelf-stable for decades.

twin, a word for likeness.

Or ink, a word for stain.

Or key, a word for answer.

its present burnished hue.

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:51.600
&gt;&gt; Martha Dragich:
Good evening everyone.

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:56.180
My immediate task is to talk just a
little bit about law in literature.

00:25:56.180 --> 00:26:00.210
Responding to the question that may
be latent in many of your minds,

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:01.890
what do the two have
to do with each other?

00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:04.480
Now Roberta talked about that some.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:10.450 position:56%
And I have to say, I will talk about
literature generally speaking rather

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:13.510
than about poetry specifically,
because I am not qualified to talk

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:16.860
about poetry specifically.

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:22.950
So about 20 or 30 years ago,

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:27.440
law schools started offering
courses in law and literature.

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:33.400
There an amazing variety
of such courses.

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:38.490
There is a literature of law and
literature that has developed.

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:44.010
And it's hard to generalize much
about these courses in this field

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:47.750
of study because they're
characterized most by variety.

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:52.810
But I'll try to give you,
just in very brief form,

00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:56.900
a few of the objectives why
people offer such courses.

00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:00.200
Why people write about
law and literature.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:05.280
What do we think we -- either
field can learn from the other one,

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:08.110
how do they correspond
with each other?

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:12.930
And just by coincidence, I
read something the other day.

00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:17.640
I was reading a very new book of
essays by a poet, Mary Oliver.

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:20.410
The collection of essays
is called, "Up Stream".

00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:25.760
And I read this sentence which
seemed to me quite pertinent.

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.690
She says, "The best use

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:32.820
of literature bends not toward
the narrow and absolute,

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:35.410
but to the extravagant
and the possible."

00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:38.710
Well narrow and absolute sound
to me something like law.

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:42.960
And extravagant and possible,
perhaps something like literature.

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:46.050
And she goes on to say that
rather than providing answers --

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:49.280
I'm paraphrasing now -- rather
than providing answers --

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:54.280
Mary Oliver suggests -- literature
opens doors and tells us to look

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:57.270
at things and think about
things for ourselves.

00:27:57.270 --> 00:28:03.790
So that, I think, encapsulates
perhaps the few strands

00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:08.700
that I'll talk about in the study
and teaching of law and literature.

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:12.120
So these are some of the
most prominent objectives.

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.940
One is to contextualize law

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:18.010
and events triggering
the application of law.

00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:19.970 position:56%
A apelet opinion -- the way we teach

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:22.480
in law schools is to
use apelet opinions.

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:26.400
So the end of the line
-- the end of the story;

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:29.340
after everything has
happened, much being --

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:34.720
having been stripped out along the
way; condensed down to a narrow set

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:39.240
of relevant facts and so forth.

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:44.540
So law as delivered to law students

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:51.140
and lawyers, is narrow
in that sense.

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:53.630
It has a very narrow focus.

00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:56.650
Literature, on the other hand,
paints a much richer picture.

00:28:56.650 --> 00:29:05.410
It's full of the details of events
and lives and personalities;

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:08.300
circumstances, motivations
and so forth.

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:12.110
So finding a way to bring
some of this context back in,

00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:15.910
and to understand that regardless
of what the apelet opinion says

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:19.240
in the end, that may be the
condensed version that's relevant

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:21.150
to the rule of law
that's established,

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:24.700
but earlier on there was
a lot more to the story.

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:27.870
And it's important for
law students in particular

00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:29.330
to develop an understanding.

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:31.370
Because they're going to be dealing
with real people who are coming

00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:34.670
in at the beginning of
this story with a whole set

00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:38.970
of life circumstances and hopes and
dreams and problems and what not.

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:43.600
So building that context
back in is one objective.

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:48.470
Another objective of the law
in literature movement --

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:50.920
if you can call it that;
that's too strong a word.

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:59.950
But law in literature does have
some early connection with law --

00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:02.140
with critical legal
studies; law in feminism.

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:03.620
Things of that nature.

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:08.740
So the objective is to recognize
differences in laws meaning

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:13.920
and its impact on individual people
and different groups of people.

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:18.760
So law often speaks
universally; abstractly.

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:22.470
Using words like -- as Monica
pointed out, Black Acre, John Doe

00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:29.040
and so forth, that are abstract,
or that are perhaps fictions.

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:33.720
And it relies on concepts like,
for example, self-defense.

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:37.010
That's a concept that might
be understood and felt,

00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:40.080
and experienced, and appreciated
very differently by people

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:43.290
of different ages, genders,
races, and so forth.

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:49.680
So just to, again,
sort of reintroduce

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:52.560
that notion into legal study.

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:57.210
And literature helps that
because literature helps us see

00:30:57.210 --> 00:31:00.610
into the lives of people
who are not like us.

00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:05.660
Helps us develop an understanding
of what their lives might be like.

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:08.020
Another is to humanize law.

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:12.320
So this universal tone that
law has a matter-of-fact nature

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:17.240
of an apelet opinion can deaden
law student's ability to relate

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:21.650
to party situations and to
respond in a caring way.

00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:26.530
Literature, on the other
hand, arouses our emotions.

00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:34.620
And invites us to assess; to
judge the actions of characters.

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:39.220
And finally, law and
literature study sometimes hopes

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:44.540
to open a conversation about
the relationship between justice

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:50.620
and mercy; the dimensions
of fairness and so on.

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:57.000
So studying literature and
discussing literature can help us,

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:05.950
perhaps, reconcile the demands of
justice and the desire for mercy.

00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:12.550
And there's a strong argument to be
made that one important ingredient

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:16.650
in reconciling justice and mercy
is the development of empathy,

00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:20.090
which is what literature --
at least one of the things

00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:23.460
that literature can help us do.

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:27.290
So despite all of these various
approaches to law and literature,

00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:30.110
the different aims and
objectives and so forth,

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:35.870
I haven't seen any work really
significantly exploring law

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:37.270
and poetry.

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:41.000
So we have a perfect opportunity
tonight in our conversation

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.450
with Monica Youn, to open
that window a little bit,

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:47.460
perhaps through her reading,
which we've just heard

from her collection, "Black Acre".

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:53.430

invite Monica to join me up here,

00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:55.510

Those of us not well trained
in poetry, and I include myself

00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:41.210
in that group, certainly.

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:45.360
May still think of poems in sort
of a grade school kind of a way

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:51.900
with tidy versus strict
meters; incessant rhyming.

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:56.350
These poems don't look
that way I'm happy to say.

00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:59.570
And so perhaps they
begin to challenge

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:05.260 position:56%
at least unsophisticated rudimentary
notions of what poetry is.

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:09.760
So let me begin our conversation
Monica by asking how you see

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:13.820
or whether you see your
work in "Black Acre".

00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:16.700
Where it fits in; how it relates.

00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:22.300
Whether it exemplifies things going
on in contemporary American poetry.

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:25.510
&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: I think
that, you know, it does --

00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:27.940
you know, it is reasonably
representative.

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:30.990
And, you know, Rob can speak to
this as well, of what is going

00:34:30.990 --> 00:34:38.160
on in contemporary American poetry,
in that I think traditional form,

00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:39.930
with what is often referred to as

00:34:39.930 --> 00:34:43.110
"received form" is
one option among many.

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:45.400
And, you know, this -- you know,

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:47.770
I always feel like
this seemed more odd

00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:49.770
to people than it perhaps should.

00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:52.480
I mean you can think
of representational

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:57.040
or figurative painting as being
one option among many options

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.340
of painting.

00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:00.770
You can think of painters
as moving back and forth

00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:03.410
across various modes
of representation.

00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:07.330
And you don't find that strange,
but you know, if a poet is to write

00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:10.600
in a way that doesn't resemble
a traditional form, you know,

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:12.350
it's like, oh my God, call the
police [background laughter].

00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:16.280
So yeah, I think that -- you know,

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:19.850
so I think poets these
days are taking advantage

00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:26.940
of the widest possible pallet;
the widest possible toolbox for,

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:32.450
you know, for enacting or
rendering various states

00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:35.430
of mind; states of consciousness.

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:37.030
States of language.

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:39.950
&gt;&gt; Martha Dragich: Mm-hm.

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:46.420
And so though your poems don't
necessarily follow those received

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:51.190
forms, I noticed in
my reading of them,

00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:55.630
they do seem to invoke legal
conventions in a certain sense.

00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:59.880
For example, when you used this
one in the first "Green Acre" poem,

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:03.310
you have the motto, "He
favors our understandings".

00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:08.460
Very often you invoke, at
the beginning of the poem,

00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:15.730
or elsewhere in the
poem, you mention cadmos.

00:36:15.730 --> 00:36:19.090
"Black Acre" -- the longer
"Black Acre" poem at the end

00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:24.620
of the collection response to
Milton's "Sonnet 19" on blindness.

00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:28.680
So I wonder if you could talk with
us about why it's important to you

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:33.310
to tie your work to those
thoughts; those artworks;

00:36:33.310 --> 00:36:37.970
even paintings you've mentioned
in several poems from the past.

00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:39.270 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: I think that writing

00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:46.200
in what is called an acrostic
mode is interesting to me,

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:53.260
because it both allows and
takes away a certain freedom.

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:57.830
In that if you're writing
about an existing story,

00:36:57.830 --> 00:36:59.610
you don't have to tell the story.

00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:01.200
You can just talk about the story.

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:04.930 position:56%
If you're writing about an
existing work of art, you don't have

00:37:04.930 --> 00:37:07.640
to describe the work of
art; the work of art exists.

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:09.890
Someone can go look
at it if they want to.

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:13.620
You know, that you know,
explicatory burden is off of you.

00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:16.420
I mean you know how annoying it
is, you know, in the first couple

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:19.870
of scenes of a movie where some
character, for no reason at all,

00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:22.790
will just launch into this sort
of paragraphs long explanation

00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:24.860
of like the setting and
the context and who's who,

00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:26.160
and who's related to who.

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:29.660
And you know that's just being
done to like, relieve themselves

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:31.420
of this burden of explanation.

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:32.720
And, you know, the great --

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:35.450
one great thing about writing
acrostically is you don't have

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:36.750
to do that.

00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:39.230
You don't have to explain
yourself as much.

00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:43.270
But, you know, on the other hand
you do have a certain fidelity

00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:45.640
to what came before.

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:49.810
You know, you have --
your parameters are set,

00:37:49.810 --> 00:37:52.400
and you're sort of, you
know, tethered in a way.

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:56.850
In a way that -- and so I find
that interplay between being free

00:37:56.850 --> 00:37:59.440
and being constrained
to be very interesting.

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:10.110
&gt;&gt; Martha Dragich: And so
do you connect that with --

00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:13.420
in your thinking, with traditions
of citation and precedent?

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:14.720
&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: Absolutely.

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:18.060
I think that, you know, when you
were talking about the connection

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:22.560
between law and literature,
you know, a lot of what tends

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:24.170
to be focused in the law

00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:27.860
and literature curriculum are
the narrative connections.

00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:30.500
And I think what tends
to be left behind is --

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:33.030
are the language connections.

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:38.640
The way legal language and poetic
language function similarly.

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:44.390
And the way I like to explain this,
you know, is, in ordinary language,

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:46.300
words are pretty much
straight forward.

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:47.910
They're what my friend,
James Longenbach [phonetic],

00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:50.800
calls like "a disposable
container for meaning".

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:53.280
Like, you know, "I am going
to pick up this bottle."

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:56.680
There's nothing unclear about that.

00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:59.940
And lawyers, I think, you
know, poets know better.

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:02.050
And lawyers, in a weird
way, know better.

00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:05.650
I mean if you're looking over
contractual language on behalf

00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:07.660
of a client, and you're
trying to figure

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:11.180 position:56%
out whether this is good contractual
language, one of the things you have

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:14.370
to do is imagine every
possible scenario

00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:16.680
that could be applied
to a particular clause.

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:20.970
Like what is the most far
out possible interpretation

00:39:20.970 --> 00:39:22.990
that someone could
make of that clause,

00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:24.600
and how do we come
to terms with that?

00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:27.880
How do we cabin -- you know, you
have to recognize the uncertainty

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:31.950
of language before you can deal
with the uncertainty of language.

00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:34.490
You know, similarly, I think in the
common law tradition, which I --

00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:38.480
you know, I was a litigator, so
I'm obsessed with common law.

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:41.380
You know, you have
phrases like, you know,

00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:43.290
"Cruel and unusual punishment".

00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:47.900
Or "Due process of
law" or person that are

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:49.320
by no means straight forward.

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.680
I mean no one is just
saying, "Oh, okay those are --

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:53.820
you know, those are readily
understandable terms just

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:55.120
to be taken at face value."

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:59.210
You know as a lawyer, that your
job is to go through every instance

00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:01.600
in which those phrases
have been used.

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:04.330
And so these things just
can move through history.

00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:08.320
They're accumulating layers
of meaning as they go through.

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:09.620
&gt;&gt; Martha Dragich: Mm-hm.

00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:10.920
&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: And I tell
my students, you know,

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:12.270
it's kind of the same
thing with poetic language.

00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:16.510
Like, if you say "apple" in a poem,
you're dealing with Snow White.

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:17.970
You're dealing with Adam and Eve.

00:40:17.970 --> 00:40:19.840
You're dealing with
the computer company.

00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:22.310
You're dealing with, you know,
Gwyneth Paltrow's daughter.

00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:23.850 position:56%
You're dealing -- you know, you
have all those [background laughter]

00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:27.510
resonances that you
need to take account of.

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:30.160
And so I think both, you know --

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:33.250
but both poets and lawyers
feel that there's a lot of --

00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:36.520
at stake in recognizing,
but also working

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:39.860
with the uncertainty of language.

00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:41.160
&gt;&gt; Martha Dragich: Mm-hm.

00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:45.480 position:56%
And so maybe this would be a good
point at which to return to the poem

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:48.410
that you read earlier,
"Landscape with Dayadand".

00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:49.820
&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: Yeah.

00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:54.560
&gt;&gt; Martha Dragich: You explained
that legal concept in your reading

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:59.120
of the poem, but I thought
perhaps you could sort of lead us

00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:01.970
through a reading of the poem,
and the audience has a copy --

00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:03.270
&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: Yeah.

00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:06.100
&gt;&gt; Martha Dragich: Of the poem.

00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:07.400
&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: Yeah.

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:08.700
And I'll just -- I
mean I don't think

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:12.430
that there's anything particularly
uncertain about this language.

00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:16.330
What I was playing with really
here is the relationship

00:41:16.330 --> 00:41:18.300
between the title and the poem.

00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:22.680
The poem itself consists of a road
in the trees from the sound of it.

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:25.640
A milky shift in the water
where the silt shelves

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:28.650
down at the wet branch
beating for its life

00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:30.780
against the pages of that book.

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:33.390
So if I were to ask one of my
students in intro poetry, you know,

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:35.430
what is going on in this poem?

00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:36.730
&gt;&gt; Martha Dragich: Mm-hm.

00:41:36.730 --> 00:41:38.030
&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: And, you know, the
student would say something like,

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:41.900
"Okay, well there are these kind
of observed details of landscape.

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:43.370
There's a bit of uncertainty.

00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:47.120
You're not quite sure what's
happening; what's being looked at.

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:49.250
But at the same time
you're reasonably clear

00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:50.550
that you're in a landscape.

00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:51.850
&gt;&gt; Martha Dragich: Mm-hm.

00:41:51.850 --> 00:41:53.150
&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: There's,
you know, there's a road.

00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:54.450
There are trees.

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:55.750
There are water.

00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:57.050
We don't doubt any of that.

00:41:57.050 --> 00:42:00.040
And then there's this oddly
personified wet branch beating

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:01.340
for its life.

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:03.280
So there's an urgency
suggested there

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:05.430
against the pages of that book.

00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:09.430
And that that book is specific in a
way that calls attention to itself,

00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:12.340
and you don't know why
that book is important.

00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:16.620
And then you have the title,
"Landscape with Dayadand",

00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:22.030
which causes you to -- you know,
it's as if you were to, you know,

00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:25.350
say someone in this audience
has committed a crime.

00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:26.650
&gt;&gt; Martha Dragich: Mm-hm.

00:42:26.650 --> 00:42:28.030
&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: You know, to
say "Landscape with Dayadand" is

00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:31.480
to make you look at every noun in
the poem and say, "Wait a second,

00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:33.030
is that the murder instrument?

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:34.330
Is that the murder instrument?

00:42:34.330 --> 00:42:36.210
Is that the murder instrument."

00:42:36.210 --> 00:42:39.290
And you know, what are
the various murders

00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:42.890 position:56%
that [laughs] could've taken place
with a, you know, a wet branch or a,

00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:45.030
you know, a road in the trees.

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:49.100
And so, you know, I was kind of --
so really this poem is about kind

00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:53.460
of playing with this idea
of expectation and suspicion

00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:56.580
in the same -- in the same
way that the "Foley" --

00:42:56.580 --> 00:43:00.500
I read this with the "Foley
Square" poem with that blank in it.

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:03.930 position:56%
To think of, okay, well what does
it mean to have a blank in the poem?

00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:07.670
To set up the reader's expectation
that that blank will be filled?

00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:10.220
And that that blank will
be filled with a name?

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:11.520
&gt;&gt; Martha Dragich: Mm-hm.

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:12.820
&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: So,
you know, the poem --

00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:17.810 position:56%
I think when I tell my students, you
know, what is the medium of poetry?

00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:19.680
The medium of painting is paint.

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:24.500
The medium of music
maybe notes; maybe time.

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:27.630
You know, a relationship
between sound and time.

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:29.880
What is the medium of poetry?

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:33.860
And you know, words
certainly; white space maybe.

00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:36.750
But also the expectations
that are created

00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:39.140
in the reader's mind
by things like titles.

00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:40.670
By things like blanks.

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:41.970
So --

00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:43.270
&gt;&gt; Martha Dragich: Mm-hm.

00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:44.570
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:46.420
Thank you.

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:52.460
So I wonder then if you
might talk with us a bit

00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:57.150
about your long time dual
life as a lawyer and poet.

00:43:57.150 --> 00:44:00.610
And specifically about
how your experiences

00:44:00.610 --> 00:44:03.820
of each profession inform
the other, and yeah.

00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:06.480
Let me stop there for the moment.

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:07.780
&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: Yeah.

00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:10.090
I mean I was always
very enamored of both.

00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:15.120 position:56%
And in fact, when I was an
undergraduate I had done a political

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:18.010
science major with a
focus on legal theory.

00:44:18.010 --> 00:44:22.430
And then -- and I combined that
with a creative writing minor.

00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:27.890 position:56%
And for my creative writing minor I
wrote this long, terrible, terrible,

00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:32.640
terrible poetry sequence that my
students still like dig up out

00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:34.590
of the stacks and like taunt me
with it [background laughter].

00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:38.940
But that was based on Palsgraf
vs. Long Island Railroad Company,

00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:43.550
1928 [background laughter],
which you know, those --

00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:46.150
is one of Benjamin
Nathan Cardozo's most --

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:47.920
absolutely most famous opinions.

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:50.950
And this ties directly into what
Martha was talking about earlier

00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:56.850
about how this -- how what seems,
even in Cardozo's like, you know,

00:44:56.850 --> 00:45:04.130
beautiful language, seems
like a factual scenario.

00:45:04.130 --> 00:45:08.160
Is it self-shaped by all of
these different points of view?

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:10.980
What actually happened
in this very strange --

00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:12.930
I should probably explain what
happened [background laughter].

00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:17.130 position:56%
So Palsgraf vs. Long Island Railroad
company is a classic tort case

00:45:17.130 --> 00:45:20.750
that is used in I think every
first-year tort's textbook

00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:23.780
to explain the principal of
proximate cause and negligence.

00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:28.900
Which is, how far-fetched does
a chain of causation have to be

00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:32.300
in order for you still
to be liable for it?

00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:33.880
And so what happened
to Mrs. Palsgraf --

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:36.460
Mrs. Palsgraf is a cleaning woman.

00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:37.910
And she's standing on the platform

00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:40.480
of a Long Island Railroad
Company train,

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:42.000
trying to get to Rockaway Beach.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.300
It is August.

00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:44.600
It is very hot.

00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:46.190
It is very crowded.

00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:49.230
This man drops a package
on the tracks.

00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:51.280
The train runs over the package.

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:54.930
The package, as it turns out,
contains fireworks [laughs].

00:45:54.930 --> 00:46:00.320
The fireworks explode,
causing a crowd to stampeded.

00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:05.260
The crowd on the platform knocks
over a pair of scales that fall

00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:09.940 position:56%
on Mrs. Palsgraf, that -- this
isn't actually in Cardozo's opinion,

00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:13.410
but you know, the facts of the case
are actually that the damage was

00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:15.980
that it triggered a latent
psychiatric disorder,

00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:18.130
causing her to become mute
[background laughter].

00:46:18.130 --> 00:46:20.610
And so you're like, okay,

00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:24.970
so [laughs] is the railroad
company liable to Mrs. Palsgraf.

00:46:24.970 --> 00:46:31.860
Under a negligence -- under
the tort of negligence.

00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:37.190
And the judge I actually ended up
clerking for, you know, years --

00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:40.620
five years later, through
some weird coincidence.

00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:44.890
Judge John Nunan on the 9th
Circuit had written a book called,

00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:46.340
"Persons and Masks of the Law" --

00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:47.640
&gt;&gt; Martha Dragich: Yes.

00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:48.940
Yes.

00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:50.240
&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: Which is one
of the early classics of law

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:53.720
and literature, which talks
about the Mrs. Palsgraf decision,

00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:58.480
and talks about the way in which
Cardozo very carefully shapes the

00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:00.890
narrative and makes it
into the finished apelet --

00:47:00.890 --> 00:47:02.190
&gt;&gt; Martha Dragich: Mm-hm.

00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:03.840
&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: You
know, to make it seem --

00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:09.900
to make his account of
things seem more inevitable.

00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:11.200
&gt;&gt; Martha Dragich: Mm-hm.

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:12.500
Mm-hm.

00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:13.800
&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: More
certain, you know?

00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:15.100
&gt;&gt; Martha Dragich: Right.

00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:16.400
&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: And so -- and
then I was also studying --

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:18.930
I took a class with the great
legal historian, Morton Horowitz.

00:47:18.930 --> 00:47:20.230
&gt;&gt; Martha Dragich: Mm-hm.

00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:21.530
Yeah.

00:47:21.530 --> 00:47:22.830 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: And he had also kind

00:47:22.830 --> 00:47:25.080
of framed the Mrs. Palsgraf
decision, and said that, you know,

00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:27.580
"Well this decision is being
written at the same time

00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:30.150
that modernist artists are thinking

00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:33.180
about what does it mean
to frame a work of art?

00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:36.320
How do we, you know, consider
these shifts in perspective?

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:40.030
These changes in, you know, in the
technologies of representation?

00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:43.200
And so, you know, I wish more of
this had made it into the terrible,

00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:44.980
terrible poems that I wrote
[background laughter],

00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:46.840
and get inspired by that.

00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:50.120
But, you know, so I've always kind
of been thinking about the ways

00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:51.940
in which the two go together.

00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:53.240
&gt;&gt; Martha Dragich: Mm-hm.

00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:55.620
&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: And, you know,
in my last job as a lawyer,

00:47:55.620 --> 00:48:00.720 position:56%
I was a Constitutional lawyer
working with a lot of this language.

00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:04.060
And, you know, I was working
both with apelet attorneys,

00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:09.880
who as crafters of language, you
know, are really hard to match.

00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:11.410
And also with my boss,

00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:14.080
who was President Clinton's Chief
Speech Writer for five years.

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:15.490
And who I worked with very closely.

00:48:15.490 --> 00:48:18.850
And we would talk about the
ways in which legal language

00:48:18.850 --> 00:48:21.210
and poetic language were related.

00:48:21.210 --> 00:48:22.660
&gt;&gt; Martha Dragich: Mm-hm.

00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:28.910
And so that's a perfect segway into
asking you how you use the tools

00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:31.820
of poetry in your law practice?

00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:36.050
&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: Well I did
once get to point out that a --

00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:38.540
in a trademark case, that
something was a trophy.

00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:42.890
I think that that was my
[laughs] -- my favorite moment.

00:48:42.890 --> 00:48:46.980
But no, I think that
the tools of poetry.

00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:48.640
Compression.

00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:50.530
Repetition.

00:48:50.530 --> 00:48:56.240
You know, those sort of cadences
are often times the tools

00:48:56.240 --> 00:49:00.650
of what makes you a
good advocate or not.

00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:01.950
&gt;&gt; Martha Dragich: Mm-hm.

00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:03.250
&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: Especially
when you're, you know,

00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:04.550
delivering oral argument.

00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:08.690
Or when you're trying to write a
brief in which you're trying to,

00:49:08.690 --> 00:49:13.880 position:56%
you know, compress you know, 100,000
pages of trial record into a,

00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:17.390
you know, a 54 or 28-page
brief with all of the,

00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:19.270
you know, rule what is it, 35?

00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:22.110
Like, you know font and
margin restrictions.

00:49:22.110 --> 00:49:25.310
And, you know, and trying to
do that and trying to boil it

00:49:25.310 --> 00:49:28.790
down to its core and
to come up with a way

00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:33.830
in which the court hasn't
thought about it was absolutely

00:49:33.830 --> 00:49:35.190
about the crafting of language.

00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:39.480
I think no one ever devotes as much
thought to semicolons as lawyers

00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:40.910
and poets do [background laughter].

00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:42.210
&gt;&gt; Martha Dragich: I know, right?

00:49:42.210 --> 00:49:44.430
&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: Like no one else
cares that much about, like,

00:49:44.430 --> 00:49:45.840
you know -- or advertising.

00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:47.790
You know, I mean there
are a lot of --

00:49:47.790 --> 00:49:51.780
a lot of professions that
focus very, very intensively

00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:55.120
on the written word, but
certainly those are two of them.

00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:56.420
&gt;&gt; Martha Dragich: Yeah.

00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:57.720
And I'd have to say that in
this collection that's one

00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:00.560
of the things I most love is
the grammatical nerdiness,

00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:03.210
or whatever it was you called it
earlier [background laughter].

00:50:03.210 --> 00:50:06.560
The very careful word choices.

00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:07.860
The punctuation.

00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:09.160
The white space --

00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:10.460
&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: Yeah.

00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:11.760
&gt;&gt; Martha Dragich: All of it,
it's just very, very compelling.

00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:13.680
&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: Well, yeah
because I remember one

00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:18.980
of my law professors had a
challenge to the class which was --

00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:22.900
there was a particular
restatement of some negligence --

00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:26.780
I can't remember what it was
-- and it was 28 words long.

00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:28.080
That I do remember.

00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:36.030
And he said, "If anyone can make
this 27 words without, you know,

00:50:36.030 --> 00:50:38.960
losing either accuracy or grammar,

00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:41.390
then you automatically get
an A in this course [laughs].

00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:42.690
And no one could do it.

00:50:42.690 --> 00:50:45.610
I mean that was the most
compressed possible form

00:50:45.610 --> 00:50:46.910
in which you could say that.

00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:48.210
&gt;&gt; Martha Dragich: Mm-hm.

00:50:48.210 --> 00:50:49.710
&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: And you know,
that sort of training --

00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:51.010
&gt;&gt; Martha Dragich: Mm-hm.

00:50:51.010 --> 00:50:53.340
&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: Is
something that's, you know,

00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:54.980
that hopefully remains part

00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:56.820
of the legal profession
for a long time then.

00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:58.360
&gt;&gt; Martha Dragich: Mm-hm.

00:50:58.360 --> 00:50:59.660
&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: I mean
people make fun

00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:01.160
of legal language all the time --

00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:02.460
&gt;&gt; Martha Dragich: Yes [laughs].

00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:03.760
&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: You know, but
it's functional language often,

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:05.060
when it's good.

00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:07.360
&gt;&gt; Martha Dragich: Mm-hm.

00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:11.560
So you used the word,
"advocate" a few minutes ago,

00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:14.400
which of course describes
the role of an attorney.

00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:16.160
How do you see your role as a poet?

00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:18.820
And I suppose I would
append to that question,

00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:21.740 position:56%
whether you could give us an example
from your current collection,

00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:26.150
"Black Acre", that particularly
exemplifies that role?

00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:27.450
&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: I don't
know that I can think --

00:51:27.450 --> 00:51:30.090
I don't know that I
have a role as a poet.

00:51:30.090 --> 00:51:33.250
I mean I am a poet, like I --

00:51:33.250 --> 00:51:35.970
you know, I feel like I have
a role as a teacher of poetry.

00:51:35.970 --> 00:51:37.270
&gt;&gt; Martha Dragich: Mm-hm.

00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:41.300
&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: I feel like I have
a role, you know, but as a poet --

00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:45.410
it's interesting, you know, part
of the reason I ended up shifting

00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:49.470
over to poetry is I wanted the
ability to define my own forms

00:51:49.470 --> 00:51:54.510
to say that this is going -- I'm
going to set my -- you know --

00:51:54.510 --> 00:51:56.920
you know, my -- one
of my poetic mentors,

00:51:56.920 --> 00:52:00.410
Paul Muldoon [phonetic] is --
I can't remember, you know,

00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:03.430
he says that a -- every
poem has rules.

00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:05.470
But every poem sets its
own rules, you know?

00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:06.770
&gt;&gt; Martha Dragich: Yeah.

00:52:06.770 --> 00:52:08.070
&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: And I'm a
rule-bound person, I realize that.

00:52:08.070 --> 00:52:11.730 position:56%
But I don't necessarily want someone
else setting the rules for me.

00:52:11.730 --> 00:52:14.040 position:56%
And, you know, I feel like the rules

00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:19.020
by which I write are necessary
to become -- to succeed.

00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:23.350
But I want to have the freedom
to find those rules myself.

00:52:23.350 --> 00:52:26.310
To discover the rules that will
make this particular poem be an

00:52:26.310 --> 00:52:29.930
expression of this
particular thought process.

00:52:29.930 --> 00:52:31.230
So --

00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:32.530
&gt;&gt; Martha Dragich: Mm-hm.

00:52:32.530 --> 00:52:38.890
Mm-hm. Perhaps with that I will
invite questions from any members

00:52:38.890 --> 00:52:41.510
of the audience for Monica?

you tell us what the outcome was

not liable [background laughter].

00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:04.730
&gt;&gt; Martha Dragich: This
was too far-fetched.

00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:06.030
&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: Yes,
this was too far-fetched.

00:53:06.030 --> 00:53:12.260
So -- and the way in which -- and
the way in which Cardozo, you know,

00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:18.860 position:56%
describes the story is to maximize
the outlandishness of what happened.

00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:20.790 position:56%
To kind of make the narrative point,

00:53:20.790 --> 00:53:23.360
no one could possibly
have foreseen this,

00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:25.340
you know, this chain of events.

00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:28.440
Whereas had he phrased it
simply as something like,

00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:31.050
on a crowded platform,
could someone get hurt?

Mm-hmm?

made it satirical.

he almost made fun --

you know, and that's
one of the -- yeah.

00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:42.170
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: He almost
poked fun at --

&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: Yeah.

00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:44.770
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is one of the things
I think people took exception to,

00:53:44.770 --> 00:53:46.070
being in a place where
it can be taught.

these cases, you know, I was --

00:53:49.970 --> 00:53:53.540
I recently -- I read at
Columbia a couple weeks ago,

who is taking tort law

like the lighted squib
or the eggshell leg.

you're just like, you
know, they're funny

00:54:08.780 --> 00:54:10.860
but at some point they
were real people.

00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:12.390

00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:14.470
in the framework of
the reasonable man.

Yeah.

&gt;&gt; Martha Dragich: And so could a
reasonable person have foreseen all

of this?

[ Background Room Sounds ]

00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:54.750
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [Inaudible] so,
you know, my field is physics.

00:54:54.750 --> 00:55:00.430
And we often try to
do everything we can

00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:01.760
to find those invariant
relationships

00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:04.780
where equations [inaudible].

00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:08.470
And here in [inaudible] example of
the law and professional poetry --

00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:13.260
poetry helps to provide -- the
richness of contents deepens

00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:15.790
in meaningfulness of things.

00:55:15.790 --> 00:55:21.810
And I wonder if in many fields
we need to retrieve further,

00:55:21.810 --> 00:55:26.490
the particular context deepens
and the meaning and the semantics,

00:55:26.490 --> 00:55:28.340
and not so much just
focus on the [inaudible].

00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:33.820
Because we sometimes get too
abstract, like in economic theory

00:55:33.820 --> 00:55:38.480
or in physics, perhaps this can
be [inaudible] a good example

00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:42.480
that includes other areas
so that we have not just law

00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:44.410

00:55:52.550 --> 00:55:53.880
&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: Well, I think
it's always useful for disciplines

00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:58.810
to have someone come
in from the outside

00:55:58.810 --> 00:56:00.250
and kind of reality check them.

of bring a completely new
way of thinking about --

if you're familiar with it.

00:56:56.930 --> 00:56:58.230
&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: I've
read it, actually.

00:56:58.230 --> 00:56:59.530
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: So I'm curious,

00:56:59.530 --> 00:57:03.630
that maybe you could
tell me [inaudible] says

00:57:03.630 --> 00:57:05.110
and what [inaudible].

00:57:05.110 --> 00:57:06.910
&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: Well I think
for Ben to call the book,

00:57:06.910 --> 00:57:10.310
"The Hatred of Poetry" was more of
a sales tactic than anything else.

00:57:10.310 --> 00:57:12.430
It's not really what
the book's about.

00:57:12.430 --> 00:57:15.560
I mean the book starts
off with a discussion

00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:18.640
of Maryanne Moore's
famous, you know,

00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:23.620
first phrase to the poem called,
"Poetry, I too dislike it."

00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:28.980
But what he goes on to really
talk about is the difference

00:57:28.980 --> 00:57:35.310
between the ideal poem as, you
know, as rendered in various poems.

00:57:35.310 --> 00:57:38.830
And the poets inability
to match up to that idea.

00:57:38.830 --> 00:57:41.710
Which, you know, doesn't end up
for me having that much to do

00:57:41.710 --> 00:57:43.610
with the hatred of poetry period.

00:57:43.610 --> 00:57:50.490
I do find, you know,
the notion that,

00:57:50.490 --> 00:57:53.380
you know no one should be
interested, not just in poetry

00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:57.410
but any of the -- but in art in
general; difficulty in general,

00:57:57.410 --> 00:57:59.470
a little bit dispiriting.

00:57:59.470 --> 00:58:02.120
I'm sure for the same
reasons you're thinking about.

00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:06.720
And, you know, and I think a lot of
-- but I do enjoy, you know, my --

00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:10.580
our -- we have a wide enough
poetry program where I teach,

00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:13.580
where almost none of the students
I have are English majors.

00:58:13.580 --> 00:58:16.890
And most of my students
cannot name a single poet

00:58:16.890 --> 00:58:18.370
on their first day of class.

00:58:18.370 --> 00:58:21.160
And I don't really pull
my punches with them.

00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:24.440
You know, and you know, and for
these students who are very smart

00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:27.200
and very hard working,
and very risk-adverse,

00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:30.250
to engage poetry is really
interesting for them.

00:58:30.250 --> 00:58:33.200
What I tell them is
that, "You are very used

00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:35.270
to learning how to succeed.

00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:37.330
You do not know how to fail.

00:58:37.330 --> 00:58:41.730
And there's something about art
which has a humility built in.

00:58:41.730 --> 00:58:43.030
It teaches failure.

00:58:43.030 --> 00:58:46.800
It teaches uncertainty when
people are used uncertainty.

00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:49.890
And I think that that -- you know,
if that gets lost, then we're all

00:58:49.890 --> 00:58:52.190
in a lot of trouble
[background laughter].

00:58:57.500 --> 00:58:59.820
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: I thank you so much.

00:58:59.820 --> 00:59:03.180
[Inaudible] a poetry lecture and
[inaudible] what could we do?

00:59:03.180 --> 00:59:08.910
I work in the public often,
and some of our [inaudible]

00:59:08.910 --> 00:59:14.220 position:56%
under the Plain Language Act
[inaudible] Policy in plain language

00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:17.310
so that people can
understand it, and I wondered

00:59:17.310 --> 00:59:21.110
about your perspective from an
ethical end and as [inaudible].

00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:26.110
And also how that is affecting
the field if [inaudible].

00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:29.700
&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: Yeah,
I love the idea

00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:31.310
of the Plain Language Act
[background laughter].

00:59:31.310 --> 00:59:35.390 position:56%
I mean if you've read any -- you
know, if you're used to legislation.

00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:38.550
The problem is not that any of
the words are incomprehensible in

00:59:38.550 --> 00:59:42.610
and of themselves, is that you have
this like, you know, this you know,

00:59:42.610 --> 00:59:44.720
massive document that
have, you know,

00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:46.470
phrases that are internally
contradictory

00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:48.010
that just cannot work together.

00:59:48.010 --> 00:59:50.470
I mean the problem isn't the
language, the problem is,

00:59:50.470 --> 00:59:52.010
you know, the bill itself, often.

00:59:52.010 --> 00:59:53.310
&gt;&gt; Martha Dragich: Mm-hm.

00:59:53.310 --> 00:59:56.270
&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: And -- you know,
but I -- yeah, and I feel like the,

00:59:56.270 --> 01:00:02.610
you know, it's all the fault of
people trying to be too smart,

01:00:02.610 --> 01:00:05.570
you know, to be kind of a
troubling thing, you know?

01:00:05.570 --> 01:00:11.350
The reason, you know, it's because
people are being overly fancy.

01:00:11.350 --> 01:00:13.780
No, it's because you know, no
one in Congress bothered to work

01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:17.330
out the details of this thing
[laughs] before they enacted it --

01:00:17.330 --> 01:00:19.260
&gt;&gt; Martha Dragich: And because
they're hiding compromises

01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:20.560
that they don't want to own up to.

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:22.620
&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: And because they're
hiding compromises, and yeah.

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:23.920
So --

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.220
&gt;&gt; Martha Dragich: Mm-hm.

01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:26.520
That's why it's obscure.

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:27.820
&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: Mm-hm.

01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:29.120
Exactly. Because they don't want
people to understand it too well,

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:31.000
because if people understand
it too well, they'll understand

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.980
where the bodies are buried
[background laughter].

01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:42.400
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: So thank you.

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:48.250 position:56%
So moving from the language statutes
to the language of [inaudible],

01:00:48.250 --> 01:00:54.500
first of all have you had
[inaudible] justice and [inaudible]

01:00:54.500 --> 01:01:01.550
and then second, what role do
you see poetry or poetic thinking

01:01:01.550 --> 01:01:06.630
in the [inaudible], are there
any [inaudible] or any pitfalls

01:01:06.630 --> 01:01:10.120 position:56%
that you can poetically [inaudible]?

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:11.420
&gt;&gt; Monica Youn: Yeah.

01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:13.110
I mean I think that, you
know, the answer to both

01:01:13.110 --> 01:01:16.190
of those questions ends up kind
of coming down to the same thing.

01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:20.830
I both love the writing of Benjamin
Nathan Cardozo, as many people do.

01:01:20.830 --> 01:01:25.400
And I also deeply distressed the
writing of Benjamin Nathan Cardozo.

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:31.370
There's something about simplicity
and analogy which are the stock

01:01:31.370 --> 01:01:39.630
and trade of both poetry and law
that are -- that are so, you know,

01:01:39.630 --> 01:01:44.530
that are so deeply powerful
that when wrongly deployed,

01:01:44.530 --> 01:01:47.430
they can wreak havoc because --

01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:50.220
simply because they are so
simple and so convincing.

01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:54.900 position:56%
Like my previous job immediately
before teaching poetry full time was

01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:57.980
I was a campaign finance
lawyer and advocate.

01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:04.480
And, you know, the campaign finance
law has been shaped really --

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:07.060
the Constitutional law of
campaign finance has been shaped

01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:10.070
by three metaphors.

01:02:10.070 --> 01:02:12.160
That money is speech.

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:14.650
That corporations are people.

01:02:14.650 --> 01:02:17.450
And that elections
are a marketplace.

01:02:17.450 --> 01:02:20.150
And those sound very
simple and very appealing.

01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:22.070
But if you start to say,
"Hey, wait a second.

01:02:22.070 --> 01:02:25.850
Those analogies don't actually
hold up all that well."

01:02:25.850 --> 01:02:27.650
Then, you know, it's -- you know,

01:02:27.650 --> 01:02:32.270
you start to see the
troubling nature of, you know,

01:02:32.270 --> 01:02:38.370
the pitfalls of poetic
language used in, you know --

01:02:38.370 --> 01:02:41.780
poetic language that has
the power of law behind it.

01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:46.640
&gt;&gt; Martha Dragich: Mm-hm.

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:47.940
Mm-hm.

01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:49.240
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: I think on
that [inaudible] [laughs].

01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:55.920
Well, and this evening, thanks
so much to both Martha and Monica

01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:57.970
for an amazing conversation.

01:02:57.970 --> 01:03:01.290
A great, great, great start to
our law and literature series;

01:03:01.290 --> 01:03:03.840
hopefully to come again
to the library.

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:06.200 position:56%
Thanks to all of you for coming out.

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:08.080
Again, we hope you
go buy "Black Acre".

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:10.130
Obviously, there are a
lot more exciting poems

01:03:10.130 --> 01:03:11.700
in there for you to check out.

01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:13.840
You can buy them in the back;
Monica will sign the book.

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:18.360
We also have surveys either
on your seat or next to you.

01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:19.660
We hope you fill them out.

01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:21.870
It helps us in determining
what we're going to do

01:03:21.870 --> 01:03:23.170
with our future programming.

01:03:23.170 --> 01:03:24.670
We hope you enjoy tonight.

01:03:24.670 --> 01:03:26.280
Please write down what you think.

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:30.790
You can give it to me; you can put
it on the table or put it up here.

01:03:30.790 --> 01:03:32.090
And we hope to see you soon again.

01:03:32.090 --> 01:03:34.140

laughter].

comments] sure.

01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:45.510
