00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.150
This idea of slope doesn't
just work with hills and

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:06.270
staircases it works with
mathematical graphs as well.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.650
Lines have a slope,
just like hills and stairs do.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.860
Take this line, for example.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.912
If I pick any two points in this line,
let's say this one,

00:00:14.912 --> 00:00:19.812
which is 0,0, and I don't know,
this one which occurs at 2,4.

00:00:19.812 --> 00:00:22.330
I can compute the rise
over the run of this line.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.080
So the rise would be this
vertical increase in distance.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.845
And the run would be
the horizontal increase over here.

00:00:30.065 --> 00:00:32.412
And I can tell goes up one,
two, three, four.

00:00:32.412 --> 00:00:36.445
And it goes over 1, 2.

00:00:36.445 --> 00:00:37.695
4 and 2.

00:00:37.695 --> 00:00:42.220
So the slope of this line is
equal to the rise over the run,

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.000
which in this case is 4 over 2 or
just 2.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.589
Now let's calculate the slope of this
line, thinking slightly differently, and

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:50.726
let's see what happens.

00:00:50.726 --> 00:00:54.830
Instead of using 0, 0 and 2,
4 let's use 0, 0 and a different point.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.650
Let's use 0,0 and I don't know 3,6.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:05.800
Well now the rise is six and
the run is three.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.910
If I calculate the slope as the rise
over the run, I still get a value of 2.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.220
So it doesn't matter
which points you choose.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.680
A line slope Is a line slope.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.150
So let's practice with
a slightly different line.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.490
Let's look at this line.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.168
So what is the slope of this line?

00:01:23.168 --> 00:01:26.390
You can enter the answer
here as rise over run, but

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.600
make sure it's fully simplified.
