00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.640
Let's say we have the following
second order

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.680
differential equation.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.860
We have second derivative of
y, plus 4 times the first

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.590
derivative, plus 4y
is equal to 0.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.330
And we're asked to find the
general solution to this

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:20.280
differential equation.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.250
So the first thing we do, like
we've done in the last several

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.940
videos, we'll get the
characteristic equation.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:31.590
That's r squared plus 4r
plus 4 is equal to 0.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.830
This one is fairly
easy to factor.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.570
We don't need the quadratic
equation here.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.680
This is r plus 2
times r plus 2.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.020
And now something interesting
happens, something that we

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.830
haven't seen before.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.150
The two roots of our
characteristic equation are

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.150
actually the same number,
r is equal to minus 2.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.980
So you could say we only have
one solution, or one root, or

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.000
a repeated root.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.560
However you want to say it, we
only have one r that satisfies

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.690
the characteristic equation.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.450
You might say, well
that's fine.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.280
Maybe my general solution is
just y is equal to some

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:12.420
constant times e to the minus
2x, using my one solution.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.040
And my reply to you is,
this is a solution.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.390
And if you don't believe
me you can test it out.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.860
But it's not the general
solution.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:22.810
And why do I say that?

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.610
Because this is a second order
differential equation.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.690
And if someone wanted a
particular solution, they

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.810
would have to give you two
initial conditions.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.020
The two initial conditions we've
been using so far are,

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:42.860
what y of 0 equals, and what
y prime of 0 equals.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.530
They could give you what y
of 5 equals, who knows.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.640
But in general, when you have
a second order differential

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.790
equation, they have to give you
two initial conditions.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.830
Now the problem with this
solution, and why it's not the

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.960
general solution, is if you
use one of these initial

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.400
conditions, you can solve
for a c, right?

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.110
You'll get an answer.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.470
You'll solve for that c.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.650
But then there's nothing
to do with the

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:05.880
second initial condition.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.300
In fact, except for only in one
particular case, whatever

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.930
c you get for the first initial
condition, it won't be

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.240
that-- this equation won't
be true for the

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.520
second initial condition.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.600
And you could try it out.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.340
I mean, if we said, y of 0 is
equal to A and y prime of 0 is

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.730
equal to 5A.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:27.950
Let's see if these work.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:34.450
If y of 0 is equal to A, that
tells us that A is equal to c

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.010
times e to the minus
2 times 0.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.590
So e to the 0.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.740
Or c is equal to A, right?

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.790
So if you just had this first
initial condition, say fine,

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.520
my particular solution is
y is equal to A times e

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.510
to the minus 2x.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.640
Let's see if this particular
solution satisfies the second

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.720
initial condition.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.410
So what is the derivative
of this?

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.750
y prime is equal to minus
2Ae to the minus 2x.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.420
And it says that 5A-- this
initial condition says that 5A

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.960
is equal to minus 2A times
e to the minus 2 times

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.690
0, so e to the 0.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.100
Or another way of saying that,
e to the 0 is just 1.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.150
It says that 5A is equal
to minus 2A, which

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.050
we know is not true.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.800
So note, when we only have
this general, or

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.580
pseudo-general, solution, it can
only satisfy, generally,

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:32.730
one of the initial conditions.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.560
And if we're really lucky,
both initial conditions.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.060
So that at least gives you an
intuitive feel of why this

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.145
isn't the general solution.

00:03:42.145 --> 00:03:44.820
So let me clean that up a little
bit so that I-- I have

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.020
a feeling I'll have to
use this real estate.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.270
So what do we do?

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.280
We can use a technique called
reduction of order.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.630
And it really just says,
well let's just

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.790
guess a second solution.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.340
In general when we first thought
about these linear

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.940
constant coefficient
differential equations, we

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.840
said, well e to rx might
be a good guess.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.530
And why is that?

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.650
Because all of the derivatives
of e are kind of multiples of

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.010
the original function, and
that's why we used it.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.450
So if we're looking for a second
solution, it doesn't

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.079
hurt to kind of make
the same guess.

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.149
And in order be a little bit
more general, let's make our

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:23.830
guess for our second solution--
I'll call this g

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:31.700
for guess-- let's say it's some
function of x times our

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.450
first solution, e
to the minus 2x.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.590
I could say some function of x
times c times e to the minus

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.280
2x, but the c is kind
of encapsulated.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.150
It could be part of this some
random function of x.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.880
So let's be as general
as possible.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.380
So let's assume that this is a
solution and then substitute

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.680
it back into our original
differential equation, and see

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.010
if we can actually solve for
v that makes it all work.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.700
So before we do that, let's
get its first and second

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:00.710
derivatives.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.540
So the first derivative of g
is equal to-- well this is

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:05.790
product rule.

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.570
And I'll drop the v of x, we
know that v is a function and

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:09.920
not a constant.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.250
So, product rule, derivative
of the first, v prime times

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:20.690
the second expression, e to the
minus 2x, plus the first

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.870
function, or expression, times
the derivative of the second.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.890
So minus 2 times e
to the minus 2x.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.190
Or, just to write it a little
bit neater, g prime is equal

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:46.150
to v prime e to the minus 2x
minus 2ve to the minus 2x.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.570
Now we have to get the
second derivative.

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.610
I'll do it in a different
color, just to fight the

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.220
monotony of it.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.780
So the second derivative-- we're
going to have to do the

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.770
product rule twice-- derivative
of this first

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:56.380
expression.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:07.260
It's going to be v prime prime
e to the minus 2x, minus 2v

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.390
prime e to the minus 2x.

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.400
That was just the product
rule again.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.060
And then the derivative of the
second expression is going to

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.330
be-- let's see, derivative of
the first one is v prime-- so

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:31.770
it's going to be minus 2v prime
e to the minus 2x, plus

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:36.030
4ve to the minus 2x.

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:37.340
I hope I haven't made
a careless mistake.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.010
And we can simplify
this a little bit.

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:42.750
So we get the second derivative
of g, which is our

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:47.350
guess solution, is equal to
the second derivative of v

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:58.130
prime, e to the minus 2x minus
2v prime-- no, minus 4, sorry,

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:02.570
because we have minus 2, minus
2-- minus 4v prime e to the

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:10.710
minus 2x, plus 4ve
to the minus 2x.

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:14.120
And now, before we substitute it
into this, we can just make

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:14.910
one observation.

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:16.840
That will just make the algebra
a little bit simpler.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.530
Notice that g is something
times e to the minus 2x.

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.940
G prime is-- we could factor
out an e to the minus 2x.

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.740
And g prime prime, we
can factor out an e

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.260
to the minus 2x.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.740
So let's factor them
out, essentially.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:36.150
So when we write this, we can
write-- so the second

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:40.640
derivative is g prime prime,
which we can write as-- and

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:47.830
I'm going to try to do this--
it's e to the minus 2x times

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:48.690
the second derivative.

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.610
So now we can get rid of the
e to the minus 2x terms. So

00:07:51.610 --> 00:08:00.580
that's v prime prime minus
4v prime plus 4v, right?

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.130
If I just distribute this out
I get the second derivative,

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:04.820
which is this.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:08.220
Plus 4 times the first
derivative.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.190
And I'm also going to factor
out the e to the minus 2x.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.580
So, plus 4 times this.

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:20.610
So it's going to be plus 4v
prime minus 8v, right?

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:26.740
Once again, I factored out the
e to the minus 2x, right?

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.050
Plus 4 times y.

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:35.110
We factored out the e to the
minus 2x-- so plus 4 times v.

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:37.070
I did that, because if I didn't
do that I'd be writing

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:39.140
e to the minus 2x, and I'd
probably make a careless

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.370
mistake, and I'd run out
of space, et cetera.

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:44.840
But anyway, I essentially-- to
get this, I just substituted

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.350
the second derivative, the first
derivative, and g back

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:48.710
into the differential
equation.

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:51.530
And we know that that
has to equal 0.

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:54.010
And let's see if we
can simplify this

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:54.910
a little bit more.

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:58.700
And then hopefully
solve for v.

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:01.800
So let's see, some things
are popping out at me.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:07.380
So I have plus 4v plus
4v, that's plus

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.090
8v, minus 8v, right?

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:13.740
So plus 4 minus 8 plus
4, those cancel out.

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.490
It's plus 8 minus 8,
those cancel out.

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:19.600
And I also have minus 4v
prime plus 4v prime.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.500
So those cancel out.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:25.280
And lo and behold, we've done
some serious simplification.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:32.840
It ends up being e to the minus
2x times v prime prime--

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.020
we could call that v prime prime
of x, now that we've

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.170
saved so much space--
is equal to 0.

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:38.870
We know this could
never equal to 0.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:42.420
So, essentially, we have now
established that this

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.120
expression has to
be equal to 0.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.590
And we get a separable second
order differential equation.

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:51.585
We get that the second
derivative of v with respect

00:09:51.585 --> 00:09:55.590
to x-- or it's a function
of x-- is equal to 0.

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:57.660
So now we just have to
differentiate both sides of

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:58.500
this equation twice.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.900
You differentiate once,
you get what?

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:10.830
v prime of x is equal to,
let's call it c1.

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:13.770
And if we were to take the
anti-derivative of both sides

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:23.330
again, we get v of x is
equal to c1 x plus

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.940
some other c2, right?

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:27.940
Now remember, what
was our guess?

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:33.990
Our guess was that our general
solution was going to be some

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:39.840
arbitrary function v times that
first solution we found,

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.160
e to the minus 2x.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.310
And when we actually took that
guess and we substituted it

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:46.960
in, we actually were able
to solve for that v.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.020
And we got that v is
equal to this.

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:50.350
So this is interesting.

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:54.000
So what is g, or what does
our guess function equal?

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:54.850
And it's no longer a guess.

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:57.540
We've kind of established
that it works.

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:03.520
g, which we can call our
solution, is equal to v of x,

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.840
times e to the minus 2x.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:15.240
Well, that equals this, c1 x
plus c2 e to the minus 2x.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:25.180
That equals c1 xe to the minus
2x, plus c2 e to the minus 2x.

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:28.660
And now we have a truly
general solution.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:31.240
We have two constants, so we
can satisfy two initial

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.260
conditions.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.560
And if you were looking for a
pattern, this is the pattern.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.950
When you have a repeated root
of your characteristic

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:42.250
equation, the general solution
is going to be-- you're going

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:45.390
to use that e to the, that
whatever root is, twice.

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:47.580
But one time you're going to
have an x in front of it.

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:52.300
And this works every time for
second order homogeneous

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.700
constant coefficient
linear equations.

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.140
I will see you in
the next video.
