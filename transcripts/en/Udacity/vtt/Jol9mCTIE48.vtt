00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now I want to talk about the H matrix.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This is a matrix that takes a state, and when it multiplies

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
by that state, spits out a measurement.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Remember, we can only directly measure position and velocity,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
so that's all we want the H matrix to keep.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Again, I want to talk about the 2D lecture case and the 4D homework case.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Hopefully, by comparing them, we'll be able to build some intuition,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and you'll be able to answer the homework.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
What was the goal of the H matrix?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The goal of the H matrix was to take some state--

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
in the 2D case, our state was represented as an x and an ẋ--

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
multiply some matrix by that state in such a way that we extract a measurement.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
In the 2D case the measurement was just x--just the x coordinate.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
We can think of this as a 1 x 1 vector or a 1 x 1 matrix.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The matrix we use to do that was this one.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
That was our H matrix--1, 0--because 1 times x gives us the x,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and 0 times ẋ gives us the nothing--exactly what we want.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
But now let's talk about the dimensionality of these matrices

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and how this multiplication yielded just this number x.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So we can think of x here as a 1 x 1 matrix.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
We got that matrix by multiplying this one, which is a 1 x 2--

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000
one row by two columns--with this, which is two rows by one column.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
What we see here is that this 1 actually came from right here,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and this 1 came from right here.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
These 2s we can think of as canceling out, in a way,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
giving us this 1 x 1 matrix.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Now, let's see if we can generalize that to the 4-dimensional case as presented in the homework.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:58.000
In the 4-dimensional case our state is now given by x, y, ẋ, ẏ.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
We're going to have some H matrix.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I don't know anything about it yet, but I'm just going to put this there for now as a placeholder.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
We want to get a measurement from that. What should this measurement be?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
It's not just going to be x, because now our position includes both x and y.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
So it's going to be a column vector--x and y.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Again, let's think. What's going on with the dimensionality here?

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Here we have a 2 x 1 matrix,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and that came from this matrix, which I said we don't know anything about yet--

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I'll just say a question mark by question mark--

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and this matrix, which is four rows by one column.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Now, can you use the intuition we built up here

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.000
for how the dimensionality of matrices works with this to fill in the question marks?

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Once you figure out the number of rows and the number of columns in this H matrix,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
figuring out where to put your 1s and 0s will be a little bit easier.

00:02:59.000 --> 09:59:59.000
I wish you luck.
