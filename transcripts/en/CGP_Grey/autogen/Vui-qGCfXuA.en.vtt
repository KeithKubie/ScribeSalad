00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.120
 When it comes to neighboring countries, many countries have several options: like Canada to the north. 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.440
 South to Mexico 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.280
 But some countries do not have such free choices; not because they are island countries 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.059
 But because they are trapped by other countries. For example, the Vatican City State. 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.070
 It is not only surrounded by Italy, but also surrounded by a city of Rome. 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.410
 How the Vatican City is trapped is very complicated, but not special; there is also the Republic of San Marino: 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:27.180
 30,000 residents are also surrounded by Italy. Obviously, Italy 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.500
 It is a country that likes the country in its own country. 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.410
 But the country is not an Italian patent. There is also Lesotho in South Africa. 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.890
 It is the largest country in China: 70 times larger than the Vatican 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.440
 Also the largest population: more than two million people 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.960
 What makes the borders of these three countries strange is any access 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.010
 Going through their only neighbours 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.090
 But look at the Gambia: except for the small coastline, it is also a country. 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.510
 Completely surrounded 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.239
 If we add any "land" access to the previous definition, we will now make a category of "countries of a single neighbouring country". 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.290
 Including the four countries just now, as well as Portugal, its only 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.740
 Access to and from the passage through Spain. Who else is in that category? 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.650
 Well, there are Monaco by France, Qatar via Saudi Arabia, Denmark. 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.549
 Through Germany, South Korea via North Korea (although South Korea can be regarded as 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:16.119
 An island country, if you want to actually travel) 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.760
 East Timor and Papua New Guinea via Indonesia, Brunei via Malaysia 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.820
 And two pairs of brothers: the only neighbor of the Dominican Republic 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.770
 Is Haiti, and Haitiâ€™s only neighbour is the Dominican Republic. 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.790
 The second pair is: Ireland through the United Kingdom and the United Kingdom 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:32.270
 Ireland. 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.229
 Small description: 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.120
 Although there are many British territories in the world, some are bordered by other countries. 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.420
 -- They are not part of the UK. This is very complicated 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.340
 But you can argue that Britain is under the strait 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.560
 Dig an underground passage boundary to the European continent, I hope to have closer contact with France, her best 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.470
 friend 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.790
 Finally, there is one more country in this category: Canada: the largest in the world and only one neighbor 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:55.620
 country.
