1
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:05.550
The part of the poem actually has a reference to the bell tolling,

2
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.530
which is kind of an earring.
Um,
totally unplanned I think,
but nonetheless,

3
00:00:10.531 --> 00:00:14.370
very strange accidental,
uh,
connection to for whom the bell tolls.

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So Phalon very word is like a bell to told me back from the to my soul self.

5
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.560
Uh,
do the fancy,

6
00:00:22.561 --> 00:00:26.780
cannot cheat so well as she is fame to do deceiving Elf.

7
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.480
So,
you know,
even from,
um,
the one with,
uh,

8
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.630
Fitzgerald himself was reciting that beauty can not keep that the of language

9
00:00:35.671 --> 00:00:40.530
here.
And um,
and what is actually in the kid's porn that,

10
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.160
um,

11
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.160
is once again as a tolling of about hauling your former self back to you.

12
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.740
Um,
there's normal is very much about,
um,

13
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.150
decline about loss of what used to be yours.

14
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.710
This is the story.

15
00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.980
The tender is the night is telling someone with tremendous promise early on in

16
00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:04.440
his life,
but basically losing it gradually.

17
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.000
And it is that subtraction,
the process of subtraction,
um,

18
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.500
things being taken away from him that the novel chronicles.
So,
um,

19
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.140
there's an awful,
you know,
I'm sure you're sick of this,

20
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.370
but there's point can very much be read within the paradigm of half and half,

21
00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:25.320
not the guy for,
and I don't think I'm,
you know,
you probably,

22
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.910
well,
any case,
it will be very interesting,
very useful to think about deep dive.

23
00:01:29.911 --> 00:01:30.511
But once again,

24
00:01:30.511 --> 00:01:35.511
if yet another example of someone who's struggling between those two posts,

25
00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.180
um,
have and have not.
Um,
but,
um,

26
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.760
the novel's only begins no very different note,
right?
Again,

27
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.710
sort of very glamorous French Riviera.
Um,

28
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.160
and in fact it's Moto on a very glamorous couple,

29
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.490
Gerald and Sara Murphy.
Um,
and so,
you know,

30
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.870
actually we can't really see how magical they were,

31
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.730
but apparently they had this circle of friends around them.
Um,
and every day was,

32
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.600
uh,
was a special day.
So,
um,
but,
uh,

33
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.090
so the novels mostly attributed that in further was a show in the bond care.
Uh,

34
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.570
um,
I think it was a couple of years ago,
calm making it new.
Um,
the odd,
uh,

35
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.360
of Gerald and Sara Murphy very much attributed to this very,
uh,

36
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.020
charismatic couple.
Um,

37
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.610
but in fact is Joe didn't have to look too far.
I'm in,

38
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.730
he and his wife seldom were quite charismatic as well.

39
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.270
Um,
and um,
certainly if very,

40
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.550
very much part of that world is there's a,
there's an,
an a PBS,
um,

41
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.550
um,
feature on Fitzgerald and this image was actually taken from it.

42
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.180
And this is another image of Fitzgerald,
his daughter,

43
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.800
Scottie,
and sell the,
the French Riviera 1926.

44
00:02:55.801 --> 00:02:58.740
And those were really the productive years,
the Great Gatsby,

45
00:02:58.741 --> 00:03:00.940
and can come out in 25.

46
00:03:00.941 --> 00:03:05.140
And then he was working on this when he was at the French Riviera.

47
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.940
Um,
but as we read on,
we know that in fact,
um,

48
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.740
that calamity or,
and that magic,
um,
probably will not sustainable.

49
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.140
So it's plus Novelis very much about sustainability.
Um,

50
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.830
how long can that last?
Um,
and uh,

51
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.650
so,
um,
this,
uh,

52
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.540
in in the funniest is almost implicit in the way that they were thought of as

53
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.720
the golden couple.
Um,
and,
um,

54
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.750
Dorothy Parker and other well known novelist said that they did both look as

55
00:03:40.121 --> 00:03:43.120
though they had just stepped out of the sun.
So you know,

56
00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:47.500
the science that they lived in this completely like field.
Well,
um,

57
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.430
but this a different way in which being in the sun,

58
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:52.773
um,

59
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.070
that again has a different meaning in Fitzgerald's career.

60
00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.630
Um,
and it turned out that in fact his only successful,

61
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.550
hugely successful novel with his first novel and even the Great Gatsby is we

62
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.810
know,
didn't sell all that well in his own lifetime.
It was other printing,

63
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.010
but before he died in Israel until they short life.
Um,

64
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.630
so Fitzgerald knowledge who,
um,
just to make a living,
um,

65
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.250
had to have other jobs and he was a screenwriter in Hollywood,

66
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.360
um,
in the,
in the 30th.
Um,

67
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:33.280
and so there are a number of books written about Fitzgerald as a screenwriter,

68
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.160
um,
this,
um,
some time in the sun,

69
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.580
but it pretty much is kind of an ironic,
um,

70
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.230
reference to being in the sun is we can see from the pictures,

71
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.160
Ashley now such a glamorous thing to be a screenwriter in Hollywood.

72
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.050
You're stuck with your typewriters.

73
00:04:50.051 --> 00:04:54.730
So the phrase that was used for all the screenwriters,
including Fitzgerald,

74
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.000
including Faulkner,
um,
as we know,
um,

75
00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.650
for all the people was that they were hacked with the Underwood typewriter.

76
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.690
There were hack writers,
um,
not having a lot of control over the material.

77
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.490
Um,
here is another book about Fitzgerald and Hollywood,

78
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.940
and this is the picture of him in the 30th.
Um,

79
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.050
struggling pretty much,
um,

80
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.740
this is a very important collection of Fitzgerald's screenplays.

81
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.810
2000 pages at the University of South Carolina.
Um,

82
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.870
and Fitzgerald himself actually also wrote 17 stories that were published in

83
00:05:34.841 --> 00:05:37.970
Esquire magazine,
um,
in early,
um,

84
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.520
while between January,
1942 may,
what do you want?

85
00:05:42.521 --> 00:05:43.780
And then he died after that.

86
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.750
So it was probably a nationally published after the staff,

87
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.920
but they're the pet hobby stories.

88
00:05:49.921 --> 00:05:53.130
There are 17 stories about the screenwriter and down in,

89
00:05:53.131 --> 00:05:56.080
out screenwriter in Hollywood,
um,

90
00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:01.130
and basically very alcoholic,
so a way autobiographical.

91
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:02.090
Um,

92
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:07.090
and so we know that film Ashley was front and Center,

93
00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.070
um,
for Fitzgeral,
um,

94
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.560
pretty much from the twenties through the 30th and till very much till the end

95
00:06:15.561 --> 00:06:18.080
of his life.
So,
um,
is,
is really,

96
00:06:18.081 --> 00:06:21.410
is throwing an organic part of his career.

97
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:26.000
So what I like to do today is to talk about,
um,

98
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:31.030
the ways in which a cinematic techniques get translated into linguistic and

99
00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.330
chore,
um,

100
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:38.000
techniques and especially in one to look at two phenomenon flashback,

101
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:43.330
which is very much something that was used in Hollywood films,
um,

102
00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:48.580
but also loaned harsh something that actually was used more in European films,

103
00:06:49.331 --> 00:06:54.090
especially in the Russian cinema.
But we're gradually making its way to,

104
00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:59.000
to mainstream Hollywood film as well.
Um,
so the,
the,

105
00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:03.830
the structure for today's lecture,
I'll begin with the publication history,

106
00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.130
um,
of the tender is the night,
um,

107
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.400
which actually the first came out in Mac in the magazine.

108
00:07:10.401 --> 00:07:14.340
And then the two additions,
the first edition has a flashback.
Um,

109
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:19.150
and the addition 51 addition much later,
um,

110
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.970
actually,
uh,
turn it into a chronological narrative.

111
00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:28.420
And what we see today actually in some restoration to that 1934 edition with the

112
00:07:29.301 --> 00:07:33.050
flash back.
And I'll give you the details of that.
Um,

113
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.290
so because the narrative order of Hendra has been,

114
00:07:36.291 --> 00:07:39.470
that is in some sense switchable or reversible,

115
00:07:39.471 --> 00:07:43.850
we'll be looking at a phenomenon or switch ability or reversibility.

116
00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:48.710
Um,
in three ways.
One is looking at sequence of adjectives,

117
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.150
um,
how they are reversible.
Uh,

118
00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:56.060
we'll be looking at the relation between actor and assessory or appendage and

119
00:07:56.061 --> 00:08:00.470
we'll be looking at in relation to training proper nouns and um,
active verbs.

120
00:08:00.471 --> 00:08:04.850
So I'll grammatical relation or kind of reversibility of promedica relation and

121
00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:09.780
then we'll be looking at montage as a technique and the way the data's,
um,

122
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:13.580
played out in thematic ways.
Um,
but first of all,

123
00:08:13.581 --> 00:08:17.570
the publication history of tenderness night,
um,

124
00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:22.370
with fair used to this.
Others quite often would publish first in magazine.

125
00:08:22.371 --> 00:08:26.510
So came out in four installments,
um,
in Scribner's magazine.

126
00:08:26.511 --> 00:08:30.710
And Scribner's was also a published,
um,
the novel in 34.

127
00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:34.610
So this is the first edition,
um,
are from that of the,

128
00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:39.000
of the novel.
And then I publish,

129
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:44.020
came out in as a them addition though the 5 cents in 1951.

130
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.630
So the two additions,

131
00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:50.900
there's a huge difference between the two additions.

132
00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:56.980
The 34 edition book one begins and 1925 and then this will jump back to eight

133
00:09:01.501 --> 00:09:05.390
years ago back to 19 and 17.
Um,

134
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:09.950
so it begins basically with dig diver and this family,

135
00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:13.890
the French Riviera,
and then it goes back when he was just a young doctor,

136
00:09:13.891 --> 00:09:15.300
that just the beginning,

137
00:09:15.301 --> 00:09:20.301
very beginning of his career as we'll promise 1917 and then it goes back to a

138
00:09:21.031 --> 00:09:25.670
later point of the slide.
And I didn't do this.
Um,
so this is the,

139
00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:30.630
um,
the,
the,
the addition that was Polish that Fitzgerald originally published.

140
00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:31.740
Um,

141
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:36.740
and some critics objected to this hour of sequence.

142
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.530
Um,
there's not from a logical narrative.

143
00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:43.950
So when it came out as the Benton classic,

144
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.750
that was switched and it began chronologically began with Dick Divers,

145
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:52.920
early promise as a young doctor and just proceed as per last week.

146
00:09:52.921 --> 00:09:57.870
So reversing the order of,
um,
of the 34 edition.
Um,

147
00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:02.100
and we're eliminating the flashback.
So,
um,

148
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:03.940
we can talk a little bit,
um,

149
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:08.550
in front of would encourage you to think more in session about why it is

150
00:10:08.551 --> 00:10:11.150
important for since general,
um,

151
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:16.190
to have the flashback one effect is achieved by having a narrative that is our

152
00:10:18.331 --> 00:10:21.030
sequence.
Um,
and um,

153
00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:25.140
I hope that I'll be talking a little bit about that,
um,
in the lectures as well.

154
00:10:25.141 --> 00:10:29.610
But I will encourage you to have your opinion really about this.

155
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:30.660
Um,

156
00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:35.190
but today I want to concentrate cause we haven't wrestle foreign to the novel.

157
00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:37.880
Um,
I want to concentrate,
um,

158
00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:41.610
on switch ability or reversibility asked.

159
00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:45.510
The relatively small scale phenomena is not so much looking at the narrative

160
00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:50.330
form as reversible,
um,
but looking at very minute details,

161
00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:53.580
um,
within the novel that are reversible.

162
00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:58.450
So order of appearance of agitators,
um,

163
00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.950
can be seen as frivolous about.
This is just one example.

164
00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:05.040
There is her on the other side,

165
00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:09.090
a young woman lay under the roof of umbrella,

166
00:11:09.091 --> 00:11:13.140
was making out of list of things from a book open on the sand.

167
00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:18.210
Her bathing suit was pulled off her shoulders and her back or ruddy orange,

168
00:11:18.211 --> 00:11:23.211
brown sell off by a string of creamy pose showing me in the sun for phase was

169
00:11:24.871 --> 00:11:28.880
Han and lovely and beautiful.
Okay.

170
00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.490
So those adjectives don't go together.

171
00:11:32.491 --> 00:11:36.450
Usually they are not seen in such close proximity,

172
00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:39.460
hard and lovely and Pinnell fall.
Um,

173
00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:44.100
and just to have those three adjectives there,
um,

174
00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:49.250
land up in that particular way generates a kind of a mini narrowed narratives.

175
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:52.480
So this is one way and wisdom wonder,
um,

176
00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:57.650
of appearance of additives is a case of a confident mini narrativize station of

177
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:03.550
a disruption,
even though it seems to be just descriptive.
Nonetheless,

178
00:12:03.551 --> 00:12:08.551
this implicit narrative suggested by that order of appearance and the narrative

179
00:12:08.981 --> 00:12:13.981
would be different if we were to reverse to water if her phase where pitiful and

180
00:12:14.501 --> 00:12:18.090
lovely and hod will be different narratives,
right?

181
00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:22.870
So less and Fitzgerald is not going to let those adjectives go as well as they.

182
00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:28.390
Um,
so,
um,
let's right here we see this,

183
00:12:28.391 --> 00:12:32.740
we also have this additional image,
um,
that she's,
um,

184
00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:36.400
her shoulders and back out ruddy and Orange Brown.

185
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:40.720
And there's a string of premier post,
um,
around the neck.

186
00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:45.490
Um,
when Fitzgerald comes back to this detail,

187
00:12:45.491 --> 00:12:48.760
he does something else for that detail.

188
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:52.360
So this is him revising himself all the time,

189
00:12:52.361 --> 00:12:56.560
revising as many narrative all the time.
Nicole driver diver,

190
00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:01.850
her Brownback hanging from her pose was looking through a resume book for

191
00:13:03.951 --> 00:13:04.960
chicken,
Maryland,

192
00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:10.620
her brown bag hanging from the truth before it was the hanging around her neck.

193
00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:16.900
All of a sudden there's a rouge losable relation to train the actor and the

194
00:13:16.901 --> 00:13:21.410
appendage so that it is hope wrong back that is hanging from the post were

195
00:13:21.411 --> 00:13:25.370
suggested,
suggested the pose I buy important and maybe money is very important.

196
00:13:25.371 --> 00:13:30.040
It really is about whether the money is more important than human being,

197
00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.950
um,
or vice versa.
So once again,

198
00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:37.190
this more than in fact more than just a minute narrative and the kind of the

199
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:42.190
whole vision of the world who version of the relation to train humanity and

200
00:13:42.191 --> 00:13:44.800
economy is suggested by the very,

201
00:13:44.801 --> 00:13:49.801
very micro detail of the reversible relation to train back and post.

202
00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:52.760
Um,
and so,
you know,

203
00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:57.000
I would say the responsibility is really the key player.
Um,

204
00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:01.360
all through the novel is,
operates on all scales,

205
00:14:01.361 --> 00:14:06.220
operates between adjectives,
operate between different books,

206
00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:08.770
you know,
the three main books of the novel,

207
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:12.490
and it operates on the shape of the diverse career.
So very,

208
00:14:12.491 --> 00:14:13.480
very important concept.

209
00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:18.690
But just to give you one more example of a very local micro instance,

210
00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:20.420
um,
of switcher go,

211
00:14:20.421 --> 00:14:25.421
or they have reversibility has to do with the transitive relation between proper

212
00:14:26.021 --> 00:14:27.820
names and active verbs.

213
00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:32.790
So we know that this character in a novel called Dick Diver,
um,

214
00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:34.120
and here's Rosemary,

215
00:14:34.121 --> 00:14:38.680
the actress talk to me about what she does and what she has to do.
Um,

216
00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:43.630
she has a fever,
uh,
but because the satisfy expensive,
they just have to,

217
00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:48.450
they just have to shoot up.
So,
um,
this is what she has to do it,

218
00:14:48.451 --> 00:14:52.250
she has to dive into the water for that,
uh,
for that episode.

219
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:57.550
One day I happened to have the grip and didn't know it and they were taking a

220
00:14:57.861 --> 00:15:02.390
scene where I dove into a canal in Venice.

221
00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.150
It was a very expensive set.

222
00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:10.270
So I had to dive and dive and dive on it.

223
00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:15.820
It obviously is not a trivial or unconnected detail in novel where the

224
00:15:19.611 --> 00:15:21.600
protagonist is called Dick Diver,

225
00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:26.620
the distributes someone else diving and diving and diving because of her

226
00:15:26.991 --> 00:15:30.410
discipline as an actress.
So,
um,

227
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:35.470
I think that that is the right then and there the question opens up is who is

228
00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:40.620
more capable as of,
of,

229
00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:44.280
of a kind of sustainable performance.
Uh,

230
00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:49.330
it seems that just the repetition of those three was dive and dive and dive or

231
00:15:50.481 --> 00:15:55.481
more than suggest that rosemary is probably going to be an actress who would

232
00:15:55.841 --> 00:16:00.410
have a long career because she's so disciplined and you know,
just hardworking,

233
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:03.790
um,
that,
um,
that,
that,
that,
that,

234
00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:08.920
that if she has to do some things,
you would do it.
Um,
and so the,
the,

235
00:16:08.921 --> 00:16:12.230
the question then,
because she seems to have such a sustainable career,

236
00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.840
sustainable performance,
um,

237
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:19.760
whether deep dive or is capable of that sustainable performance,

238
00:16:19.761 --> 00:16:21.770
the person who has been proper name,

239
00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:27.040
whether he can actually live up to the promise of his name,
Dick died or,

240
00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:30.320
um,
so,
um,

241
00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:35.380
I one how to really sit in on those two agitators hard and tearful.

242
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:38.300
Um,

243
00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:43.250
and look at the way fish Gero really spins out a whole narrative.

244
00:16:43.251 --> 00:16:46.590
Basically,
you know,
maybe the whole novel,
um,

245
00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:50.240
is based on the interplay between those two adjectives.

246
00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:54.620
So let's look at what the hub Nicco does,

247
00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:58.580
um,
and what comes through,
you know,
what,

248
00:16:58.581 --> 00:17:03.581
what kind of story emerges when we go along the access of Nicco as a hard

249
00:17:06.681 --> 00:17:11.660
person.
This is what she says to Rosemary.
I'm just talking casually,

250
00:17:11.661 --> 00:17:16.280
you know,
about the,
the,
the beach and so on and about the tours.
Um,
well,

251
00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:21.140
I have felt there were too many people on the beach this summer.

252
00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:26.450
Nicole admitted beach that day made out of a pebble,
Pio.
She considered it.

253
00:17:26.451 --> 00:17:31.451
And then during her voice of range of the trio of Nannies who sat back under

254
00:17:31.521 --> 00:17:33.110
another umbrella.
Still,

255
00:17:33.111 --> 00:17:36.950
they're preferable to those brothers last summer who kept shouting about,

256
00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:40.820
isn't this the blue?
Isn't the Sky White?
Isn't a little Nellie's Bros.

257
00:17:40.821 --> 00:17:45.320
Red Rosemary thought she would not like to have Nicole,

258
00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:48.530
Fran enemy.
Um,

259
00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:53.800
so think that this is a great demonstration of a hard person without this person

260
00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:02.010
as are you lifting a finger to do thing right?

261
00:18:02.011 --> 00:18:05.220
It's just the way her mind works.

262
00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:07.560
It is who tone of voice it is,

263
00:18:07.561 --> 00:18:11.880
the way she thinks about Nannies,
uh,

264
00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:14.370
people in her employed the ways.

265
00:18:14.371 --> 00:18:18.480
There's two things about people who don't have the claim to the beach that she

266
00:18:18.481 --> 00:18:19.314
does,
uh,

267
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:24.440
is really the swish pattern and a tome of worst of someone who's never not been

268
00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:30.030
on the top of the wall.
Um,

269
00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:35.180
and he looks down on everyone and just putting them in the places.

270
00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:40.200
Um,
so this is,
this is the hot Nicole.
Um,

271
00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:45.260
Ashley gives another meaning to her back hanging from a string of posts that may

272
00:18:47.671 --> 00:18:51.450
be really,
this is what the real Nicco is.

273
00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:55.530
It is the fact that she is hanging from the string of pearls,

274
00:18:55.740 --> 00:19:00.740
but they will always be a string of hers for her to hand from that she can

275
00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:05.730
afford to look at the world in this way.

276
00:19:05.731 --> 00:19:09.210
I look at other people in this way and speak in that particular tone of voice

277
00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:12.210
that signals to rosemary.
It takes about two seconds,

278
00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:17.430
the rosemary to know what kind of person she is dealing with.
So sheer,

279
00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:18.353
um,

280
00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:23.720
capsule summary of what a person is without recourse to any action.

281
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:27.900
Um,
and in fact Nicole doesn't really add and two or three and was a novel.

282
00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:32.460
And even that is not even,
you know,
especially hard kind of action,

283
00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:34.860
whether that's debatable.
Um,

284
00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:39.450
but as is the case with Fitzgerald,
um,

285
00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:42.630
the word heart is not allowed to stand alone,
right?

286
00:19:42.631 --> 00:19:47.631
Because we can't forget that in February three adjectives harder and lovely and

287
00:19:48.001 --> 00:19:51.170
pitiful.
So that kind of permutation,

288
00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:55.390
it's like a dance dance were agitators,
um,
will keep coming up against.

289
00:19:55.391 --> 00:19:59.970
So just a few pages later and now the description of Nicole,

290
00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:04.440
um,
who phase and there isn't time to heart,
has to be in quotation marks,

291
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:09.950
who phase was hard on western save for the soft grim appear.

292
00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:14.310
There's doubt that look from her green eyes,
right.

293
00:20:14.311 --> 00:20:19.311
So it seems that those antigens and really and waned in Fitzgerald his mind that

294
00:20:19.711 --> 00:20:24.711
he cannot think about Nicole without using that trio lovely as well.

295
00:20:25.651 --> 00:20:29.590
Or maybe they just do a just to two adjectives.
They are the,

296
00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:31.050
the two um,

297
00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:36.030
pose or the spectrum of which she shadows back and forth.
Um,

298
00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:40.940
so because plentiful is so much a companion,
um,

299
00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:42.870
to the adjective hot,

300
00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:48.290
let's look at one instance of the pitiful Nicole and see whether or not there is

301
00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:54.400
an organic connection between the beautiful Nicole and the hot Nicole.

302
00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:56.290
And we have to go back earlier.

303
00:20:56.291 --> 00:20:59.800
So we have to go back to book local forward to book two,

304
00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.170
which is backwards in time.
Um,

305
00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:07.180
go back to 1917 when she was a patient.
Um,
and,

306
00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.580
um,
Dick died on this about two,

307
00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:13.120
well actually here now even we to to do anything for her.

308
00:21:13.121 --> 00:21:16.450
He was just someone who was being consulted about her.
Um,

309
00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:22.030
and she was writing to him,
uh,
when she was in this mental institution,

310
00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:24.400
the cat and die for him.

311
00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:29.110
I'm writing to you because there's no one else to whom I can turn.

312
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:32.980
And it seems to me if there's fast ago misspelled by Nicole,

313
00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:38.080
if this farcical situation,
it's apparent to one as sick as mean,

314
00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:42.880
it should be apparent to you.
The man who would trouble is all over.

315
00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:46.900
And besides that,
I'm completely broken and humiliated.

316
00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:51.850
If that was what they wanted,
my family has shamefully neglected me.

317
00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:55.100
There's no use asking them for help of headache.

318
00:21:55.870 --> 00:22:00.130
I have had enough and it is simply ruining my health and wasting my time

319
00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:04.060
pretending that what is the matter with my head is curable.

320
00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:08.900
So this is the absolute low one.
Nicole,

321
00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:10.790
she is by herself,

322
00:22:10.791 --> 00:22:14.740
her families in Barrow's shoes in the hands of strangers who paid to take care

323
00:22:14.741 --> 00:22:18.790
of her.
Um,
and who,
who is this person who seems to have his whole life,

324
00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:23.450
a full promise ahead of him,
completely healthy,
um,

325
00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:28.960
uh,
about to be launched into this,
this great career.
Um,

326
00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:32.630
so in one sense it is,
um,

327
00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:37.800
and called and homos object that is someone who really has no future to look

328
00:22:39.581 --> 00:22:42.460
forward to.
Um,
has really no hope,

329
00:22:42.461 --> 00:22:47.230
really has nothing that she can claim extent that

330
00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:51.620
given the fact that we have seen the Hal Nichol,

331
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:56.830
I think that we should also be a learn a little bit to the suggestion of hotness

332
00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:05.830
even in this moment when Nicole and gets most object.

333
00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:11.110
And I think that in fact that misspelled word farcical was two different

334
00:23:12.711 --> 00:23:17.670
linguistic usage.
Somebody who uses the word faster go that way,
um,

335
00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:23.050
is more in command of the faculties then is suggested by the,

336
00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:28.130
uh,
by the profession of objection.
Uh,

337
00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:29.960
likewise,
um,

338
00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:35.780
it is simply ruining my health and wasting my time.

339
00:23:35.781 --> 00:23:39.650
Someone who would use the phrase ways my time is,

340
00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:42.580
has a different sense of herself.
Um,

341
00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:45.410
then it's suggested by the profession and rejection.

342
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:49.940
So right there.
Um,
even though it is the telephone,

343
00:23:49.941 --> 00:23:53.620
Nicole who is in the foreground,
um,

344
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:58.430
an element of hardness is never not on the horizon.

345
00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:03.700
And I think that is really then combination that fissure of wants us to say that

346
00:24:04.041 --> 00:24:06.350
she can be,
she's completely switchable.

347
00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:11.240
If the distance between heartlands and truthfulness is tiny,

348
00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:13.220
she would just go back and forth.

349
00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:18.200
It takes one second for the switch from one to the other.
Um,

350
00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:23.260
so one more instance of the pillar phone and they call and this one is very late

351
00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:26.880
in her life.
So this is in the present for her.
Uh,

352
00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:29.090
Nicole knelt beside the tarps.

353
00:24:29.091 --> 00:24:34.091
Weighing cy wise and size wise is you she pride in as you come to intrude on the

354
00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:39.170
only privacy I have in the world with your son Brett of red blood on it,

355
00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:43.550
I will wear it for you.
Another shame though.
It was such a big thing.

356
00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:48.320
So the word pity is foregrounded.
Um,

357
00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:51.150
but once again,
um,

358
00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:54.950
even though this is Nicole in the mind,
Nicole,

359
00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:57.080
totally out of control.
Um,

360
00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:01.800
Nicole gone crazy again and therefore she has to be medicalized.

361
00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:05.900
This is because it candidate for medicalization,

362
00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:10.250
but even though she's a candidate for medicalization,
um,

363
00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:12.910
she's also quite aggressive as well as we can see.

364
00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:17.930
[inaudible] not so defenseless is not to be able to say some pretty wounding

365
00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:23.060
things to whoever would listen to her.
Um,
so once again,
we have that combination.

366
00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:28.550
The pitiful knows this in the foreground,
but hotness is always lurking very,

367
00:25:28.551 --> 00:25:32.640
very close to the front actually in the background.
Um,

368
00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:37.310
so it's because of that I think is because the distance between the two

369
00:25:37.311 --> 00:25:40.940
switchable platforms is such a small distance,

370
00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:45.980
then I think that the technique of montage,
it's especially helpful,

371
00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:50.990
uh,
to,
um,
to Fitzgerald.
Um,
and as I said before it,

372
00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:55.030
I don't think there was actually a mainstream Hollywood,
uh,

373
00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:57.680
technique we ended 20 years yet,

374
00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:02.980
although it was already theorized by film theory is all over the world.

375
00:26:03.611 --> 00:26:04.760
So we'll give you one instance of that.

376
00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:09.290
But basically montage is a film editing techniques and,
um,

377
00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:11.150
the two things that,
um,

378
00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:16.480
that are central to it on this off and saw them from one narrative into another

379
00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:20.090
and super imposition of one onto another.

380
00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:25.150
So these are the two fundamental elements of montage and Sergei Eisenstein,

381
00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:30.450
um,
the Russian great filmmaker,
um,
in the 20s,
um,

382
00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:34.760
he wrote a lot on montage.
Um,
in fact,
um,

383
00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:40.240
I think that is most people who actually talk about attach go back to answering

384
00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:42.740
sties writing in the 1920s.

385
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:48.110
So the coin to Eisenstein montage is the nerve of cinema and the collision of

386
00:26:50.821 --> 00:26:52.110
different narratives.

387
00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:57.470
Each sequential element is perceived not next to the other,

388
00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:02.790
but on top of the other [inaudible] not next,

389
00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:05.070
even though even though they are sequential,

390
00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:09.030
even though one comes after the other and basically,
you know,

391
00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:13.500
there's no way we can,
this is how time works.
One thing comes after another.

392
00:27:13.501 --> 00:27:14.620
This is the structure of time.

393
00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:20.010
There's no way we can cap completely do without that or completely undermine

394
00:27:21.251 --> 00:27:21.750
that.

395
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:26.750
But nonetheless is a way of storytelling that makes that sequential appearance

396
00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.930
almost in case of super in position.
Um,

397
00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:34.410
and I think that this is really what Fitzgerald does for a good part of the
time,

398
00:27:34.411 --> 00:27:35.244
the intenders now.

399
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:40.430
So let's just look at five or six instances of what I would call different moles

400
00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:46.070
of super imposition or super fun,
super imposition,
um,

401
00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:47.890
being met on,
um,

402
00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:52.500
different kinds of thematics that are themselves interrelated.
So,

403
00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:53.310
um,

404
00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:58.310
war with began with Warren in the very beginning of this semester and it turns

405
00:28:00.301 --> 00:28:04.400
out that wall would come back and quite a big way,
um,

406
00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:08.190
and is normal that really otherwise it's nothing to do with war,
right?

407
00:28:08.191 --> 00:28:13.080
This is a novel set in the French Riviera and then basically in,

408
00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:17.820
in various civil in and very low sure is settings.

409
00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:18.480
Um,

410
00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:23.480
so it really has nothing to do with war except that for some reason or keeps

411
00:28:24.871 --> 00:28:29.640
coming up,
a very strange delusions.
So,
um,

412
00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:31.740
one of the first instances of this,

413
00:28:31.741 --> 00:28:35.250
and usually it comes out in casual conversation.
Um,

414
00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:39.170
so sometimes between the major character,
sometime between the of character.

415
00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:43.430
So this is a conversation between Rosemary and Tommy,
Barb and,
um,

416
00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:47.430
who's mercenary?
Um,
actually I didn't know that,
that there was,

417
00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:51.420
there was such an important class of,
of there was such an important profession.

418
00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:54.840
Uh,
but it turns out that that maybe it was in the,

419
00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:59.880
in the early 19th century and early 20th century.
Um,
so Tommy,

420
00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:00.660
uh,

421
00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:05.660
because his nurse in your amp goes around from one place to another home.

422
00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:09.870
I have no home.
I'm going into a war.
What war?

423
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:15.080
What war?
Any war.
I haven't seen the papers lately,
but I suppose there's a war.

424
00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:19.500
There always is.
Don't you care what you fight for?

425
00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:24.120
Not a law.
As long as I'm well treated and I'm in a Rut,

426
00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:29.900
I come to state of divers because then I know that in a few weeks I want to go

427
00:29:30.751 --> 00:29:35.340
to war.
Rosemary's different,
you liked the dye foods?

428
00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:38.980
She reminded him of course,
especially her,

429
00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:43.570
but they made me want to go to war.
Um,

430
00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:46.630
Tommy bothering in mercenary,

431
00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:50.560
but he certainly is not just brute strength.

432
00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:57.130
Psychological solely at play.
Here we,

433
00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:58.550
this is page 30,

434
00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:04.140
so we have no understanding of what context Tommy Bob and his speaking an hour

435
00:30:06.041 --> 00:30:10.710
of all we can say is that it is not an innocent context.

436
00:30:10.711 --> 00:30:15.711
That he has lots of things that he's holding back about how he feels about the

437
00:30:17.441 --> 00:30:22.000
divers is clear that he doesn't like tech diver right now.
That I like them,

438
00:30:22.001 --> 00:30:25.210
especially her.
Um,
but also the general says that,
you know,

439
00:30:25.211 --> 00:30:29.090
that just to seal the two of them for a couple few weeks is enough.

440
00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:32.590
That is enough to make him want to go to war.

441
00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:37.690
We don't know what it is about them that will have this kind of effect on him,

442
00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:42.040
uh,
but it never fails.
Um,
so right then and there,

443
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:47.070
this is a snake making his way until this paradise that is the French Riviera.

444
00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:51.790
Um,
the leaves,
we can say that even amount,

445
00:30:51.791 --> 00:30:56.020
the close friends and people who are right there who sit at,
you know,

446
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:58.580
who are there constantly with,
um,
um,

447
00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:02.220
the people who supposedly are very good friends with errors,
um,

448
00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:05.950
have this companion,
um,
about them.
So we have,

449
00:31:05.951 --> 00:31:10.951
this is just one mystery that we have to figure out and the details of which we

450
00:31:11.831 --> 00:31:13.990
have to fill out for ourselves.
And in fact,

451
00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:16.720
I would suggest that even at the very end of the novel,

452
00:31:16.721 --> 00:31:20.360
I'm not sure that we can completely clear up this mystery.
Um,

453
00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:25.410
but it's just saying there and it's the super imposition of love and war,

454
00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:27.340
um,

455
00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:32.340
that creates this particular kind of psychological dynamics between Rosemary and

456
00:31:33.431 --> 00:31:37.960
Tommy.
Um,
and also between Tommy and the divers.
Um,

457
00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:41.650
so,
um,
it is,
it is not even visual.

458
00:31:41.651 --> 00:31:46.570
So I just want to emphasize that when,
um,
the film technique of,

459
00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:50.470
um,
of,
of montage is used in the novel,

460
00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:52.210
it doesn't always have to be visual.

461
00:31:52.211 --> 00:31:56.270
It can just be a case of psychological super in position.
Um,

462
00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:59.320
although sometimes a Fisher also use this very,

463
00:31:59.321 --> 00:32:02.260
very visual supine position as well as who will say,

464
00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:07.410
but just to give you one more example of how a persistent Fitzgerald is about,

465
00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:11.310
um,
super imposing these two love and war.
So,
um,

466
00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:16.270
they go and they walk out and it turns out that even here in this,
um,

467
00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:20.970
very,
um,
in,
in this seeming very peaceful setting,
um,

468
00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:25.280
that Ashley,
we're worldwide was fought very close by.
Um,

469
00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:30.310
and so close by that the relics of what we're one,
we're still there.

470
00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:34.930
And this is the spot actually where um,
the British,

471
00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:35.830
um,

472
00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:40.710
could only at Vance I'm a foot at a time.

473
00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:42.540
The risk systems,
um,

474
00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:47.590
was so fierce that they can only move ahead one foot at a time.

475
00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:54.370
Army.
And it caused too many lives today for them to go forward one foot.

476
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:58.040
So the Lan here cost too many lives of fun.

477
00:32:58.041 --> 00:33:00.320
Past summer he said to Rosemary,

478
00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:05.440
she lived out obedience late at the rather than Behr green plane with a slogan

479
00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:07.400
cheese of six years world.

480
00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:11.330
If Dick has added that there were now being showered,

481
00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:16.130
she would have believed in that afternoon.
Her love her original point.

482
00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:20.030
We're now at last.
She was beginning to be unhappy,
to be desperate.

483
00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:23.150
She didn't know what to do.
She wanted to talk to her mother.

484
00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:27.590
So here Rosemary is deeply in love.

485
00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:30.410
She's in the throes of love,
of,

486
00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:34.270
of what seems to be unrequited love for,
for the um,

487
00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:39.340
and unnecessary background is World War One.

488
00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:43.320
That it is the fact that she would have been,

489
00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:48.200
if he had told her that there would be in shout once again as well,

490
00:33:48.201 --> 00:33:50.570
one that she will have believed him if he has that,

491
00:33:50.571 --> 00:33:54.590
that that is the measure of how much in love she is.

492
00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:59.860
So it seems that love is really not a free standing entity and there's novel is

493
00:34:00.771 --> 00:34:04.910
always mapped against large scale warfare.

494
00:34:04.911 --> 00:34:09.710
We don't simply know the logic of that mapping is not clear.

495
00:34:09.711 --> 00:34:10.250
In fact,

496
00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:14.840
I would also say that this is another of those mysteries that even having,

497
00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:16.940
you know,
even at the Amygdala,
the novel,

498
00:34:16.941 --> 00:34:19.460
we might not be able to see exactly what the logic guests,

499
00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:21.770
but clearly for Fitzgerald,

500
00:34:21.771 --> 00:34:26.771
there's a logic that always persistently resolves in this cross mapping or a

501
00:34:26.961 --> 00:34:30.260
super position of love and work.
Um,

502
00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:33.950
one more example just to see how I'm obsessed.

503
00:34:33.951 --> 00:34:37.100
He is really with this kind of cross mapping.
Um,

504
00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:42.140
general grants though is not just to have a one a but the civil war.
Um,

505
00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:45.290
and this is something that Fitzgerald has in common,
uh,

506
00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:48.280
where Hemingway as well in 400 bottles.

507
00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:52.430
We see that the Spanish civil war and the American civil war sometimes cross

508
00:34:52.431 --> 00:34:53.660
mapped dre,
um,

509
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:58.750
in the importance of rubber Jordan's grandfather here for no reason that we can

510
00:34:59.001 --> 00:35:02.840
see,
um,
the civil war of comes into play in the missile.

511
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:07.870
The discussion about more one general grant invented this kind of battle at

512
00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:12.050
Petersburg in 65.
No he didn't.

513
00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:14.570
He just invented mass butchery.

514
00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:19.820
This kind of battle was invented by Lewis Carroll and Jews Fun and whoever wrote

515
00:35:19.821 --> 00:35:21.770
and Dean and country deacons,

516
00:35:21.771 --> 00:35:26.771
bowling Mras and Messiah and girls seduced in the back lands who vote timber and

517
00:35:28.241 --> 00:35:30.920
verse failure.
Why this was a love battle.

518
00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:36.110
This was a century of middle class love span here.

519
00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:39.740
This the last love battle,

520
00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:43.230
totally on idiomatic use of the English language.

521
00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:47.340
Love battle is not a phrase that anyone else would use.
Um,

522
00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:51.840
Fish Gero uses it as,
as it were the most idiomatic expression in the world.

523
00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:57.080
And that's because in his mind there is such a tight knit between love and war

524
00:35:57.541 --> 00:35:59.040
that it is this,

525
00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:04.100
you almost cannot talk about one without talking about the other blue calling to

526
00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:05.340
this.
Um,

527
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:10.430
apparent analysis of war is really middle class romantic love that is at the

528
00:36:13.531 --> 00:36:18.531
back of war is very long because of a change to go from middle class love to

529
00:36:20.041 --> 00:36:23.250
trans warfare or the civil war.
Um,

530
00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:26.620
in the U s history isn't very,
very long call.

531
00:36:26.621 --> 00:36:30.600
So chain we have to fill in lots and lots of relays in all that for that course

532
00:36:30.601 --> 00:36:32.040
or change to make sense.

533
00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:36.840
But that's what Fitzgerald wants us to imagine is to imagine all those missing

534
00:36:36.841 --> 00:36:40.440
links and he's not showing us.
Um,
so this is,
um,

535
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:45.000
I think that we've seen enough to know that this really is suffering significant

536
00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:48.640
Palin not explained to us,
obviously.
Um,

537
00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:51.380
but that is one of the,
um,

538
00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:56.600
the kind of the constant,
um,
in this novel is that,
um,

539
00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:57.510
extreme,

540
00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:02.170
extreme conditions of love,
uh,

541
00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:07.230
always require a very violent,
large scale file in background.

542
00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:11.990
Uh,
Fred to be fully manifested that maybe his articulation,
uh,

543
00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:15.990
requires some relation to that large scale event.
Um,

544
00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:19.350
so I want to,
um,

545
00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:24.750
turn now to,
um,
talk about,
uh,

546
00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:29.730
we've been looking at the color,
the narrative mapping,
right.
So a large scale,

547
00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:30.690
um,

548
00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:35.690
historical event that's constantly being summoned and reactivated and brought

549
00:37:36.151 --> 00:37:40.230
into novel.
Um,
so this,
this,
this,
this on,
on this,
uh,

550
00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:43.680
of kind of macro register,
um,

551
00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:47.910
that has the micro of romantic relation.

552
00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:48.900
Um,

553
00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:53.900
but it turns out that that combination of love war can also be played out in

554
00:37:57.390 --> 00:38:01.280
very,
very incidental moment,

555
00:38:01.281 --> 00:38:06.281
is not involving the protagonist a law which suggest that,

556
00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:09.040
um,
it is a narrative fabric.

557
00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:14.050
It's a descriptive fabric that Fitzgerald is,
is,
is,
is,
is,

558
00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:19.100
is almost like a stylistic tape for Fitzgerald maybe without even making a huge

559
00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:21.930
thematic point about it.
Um,

560
00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:26.640
that's where his mind resource to whenever he talks about any kind of violence,

561
00:38:26.641 --> 00:38:31.250
there's also this other element of love that is super imposed.
Um,

562
00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:36.320
so this is a totally trivial incident except for the fact that if it shows the

563
00:38:36.851 --> 00:38:38.050
same kind of dynamics,

564
00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:43.300
the Pullman entrance to cause of the vivid scene,

565
00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:46.840
it has itself from the tenor of any farewells,

566
00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:52.440
the young woman with a helmet like hair to whom they call has spoken,

567
00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:55.750
made an odd dodging.

568
00:38:55.780 --> 00:39:00.780
The low run away from the man to whom she was talking and plunge of frantic hand

569
00:39:02.441 --> 00:39:06.880
into a post.
Then the sound to revolve of sharps crack,

570
00:39:06.881 --> 00:39:08.710
the narrow heir of the platform.

571
00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:14.350
But before the crowd closed in the others as saying the shop ticket by saying

572
00:39:14.351 --> 00:39:18.430
the target sit down upon the glass,
um,

573
00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:22.780
people were constantly getting shot,
um,
in this novel,

574
00:39:22.781 --> 00:39:25.300
which is really surprising.

575
00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:30.540
Fat We do is back murder to appear with this kind of regular reality in this

576
00:39:32.921 --> 00:39:36.220
particular kind of social setting.
But it does.
Um,

577
00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:41.060
so that in itself is the very insistent pattern.
Um,

578
00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:42.580
um,
DePaul,
the Fitzgerald,

579
00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:47.260
but I want to call attention and is highly cinematic moment.

580
00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:51.910
Um,
the,
um,
the beginning with,
with just,

581
00:39:51.911 --> 00:39:55.360
just to kind of,
you know,
the usual,
uh,

582
00:39:55.390 --> 00:40:00.130
scene at the train station,
people were saying goodbye.
Um,

583
00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:05.160
but really the introduction of a show Alaman that Ashley could be filmed,

584
00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:08.020
uh,

585
00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:13.020
with perfect two to maximum effect the young woman with the helmet light hair,

586
00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:17.960
completely gratuitous detail,
um,

587
00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:21.790
that will not have caught attention to self,
um,

588
00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:26.830
but we're not otherwise have call attention to himself,
but in this novel,

589
00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:31.910
given the certain position of loss and borders,
so it's a helmet like hair,
um,

590
00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:36.040
that who's a total stranger to Nicole then they call it spoken,

591
00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:37.720
made an odd dodging.

592
00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:42.720
The they'll run away from man to whom she was talking and lunge a little frantic

593
00:40:44.171 --> 00:40:47.480
hand her into her purse.
Um,

594
00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:52.440
is that almost Dan steps taken by that,
um,

595
00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:55.960
by that woman.
Um,
is,
is,
is,

596
00:40:56.050 --> 00:41:01.050
is this as a kind of dance movement and then the shot coming after that as not a

597
00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:07.870
predictable,

598
00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:13.140
not expected conclusion to that dance movement that creates this montage.

599
00:41:14.961 --> 00:41:19.930
If I have ray,
she's been talking to Nicole,
um,
she's making a little run.

600
00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:21.940
Um,
maybe,
you know,

601
00:41:21.941 --> 00:41:26.290
we would expect someone who's making a little run in a translation to go and

602
00:41:26.291 --> 00:41:30.250
catch the train,
right?
That's the most usual context for the Volvo run,

603
00:41:30.251 --> 00:41:34.670
except it isn't dodging little run.
And it turns out that the one comes,

604
00:41:34.671 --> 00:41:38.450
the outcome of that little run is in fact the shooting.

605
00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:43.960
So two completely separate narratives being mapped onto one another dude,

606
00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:49.970
much more standard unsurprising narrative was saying goodbye and the train

607
00:41:49.971 --> 00:41:54.470
station with a totally different story being mapped onto it.

608
00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:59.770
And it turns out that the two can actually share a lot of the same visual

609
00:41:59.841 --> 00:42:04.700
details unless there's a diversions and the violence of that diversions that

610
00:42:04.701 --> 00:42:07.580
created that particular cinematic effect.
Um,

611
00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:12.700
so just want to give you one more example of this highly cinematic rendition,

612
00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:17.490
um,
of murder.
Um,

613
00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:21.450
and it turns out that Fitzgerald,
um,
is,
um,

614
00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:25.220
especially interested in the,
um,

615
00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:30.250
the way that the sequence leading up to a murder or the sequence,

616
00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:34.970
um,
by which murder it's founding,
recognized as murder.

617
00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:40.480
So here is a description of something that happens in Rosemary's room,

618
00:42:40.821 --> 00:42:42.980
hotel room,
um,

619
00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:46.880
and it takes a long time to get to the end.

620
00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:50.900
I think that that's the point.
So let's follow visual and this very,

621
00:42:50.901 --> 00:42:52.190
very strange Paris to pastures.

622
00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:57.580
Then rather gradually she realize without turning about that she was not alone

623
00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:02.420
in the room in an inhabited room,

624
00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:04.490
they are reflecting objects.

625
00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:09.410
Only half notice fathers would more or less polished brass,

626
00:43:09.590 --> 00:43:14.590
silver in ivory and beyond this dousing conveyors of light and shadow.

627
00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:20.050
So mild that once ghastly things of them as that the tops of picture frames the

628
00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:26.160
edges of pencils or Ashtrays of Cristo or China honor when the totality of this

629
00:43:27.321 --> 00:43:32.321
reflection appearing to equally Cielo reflexes of the Vision as well as those

630
00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:38.440
association of fragments in the subconscious that we seem to hang on to as a

631
00:43:39.291 --> 00:43:44.291
glass filter keeps the irregularly shaped pieces that may do some time.

632
00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:46.460
This fat,

633
00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:51.940
my account for what rosemary afterward mysteriously described is realizing that

634
00:43:53.061 --> 00:43:57.140
there was someone in the room before she could determine it,

635
00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:59.570
which she did realize it.

636
00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:05.050
She turns with and I saw the ballet step and saw that the Leebro stress that

637
00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:14.950
this has got to be the most for discovery of the body

638
00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:21.270
and work of America,
their Azure.
Um,

639
00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:25.260
it seems almost counter productive,
um,

640
00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:30.640
for the realization on the part of Rosemary there she was not alone in a room to

641
00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:35.600
the fact that yes,
there's a debt Negro,
um,
on in bed.

642
00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:36.600
Um,

643
00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:41.600
why Fitzgerald would want to take that long detour to me actually once again,

644
00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:47.490
is not completely,
um,
uh,
it's not transparent.

645
00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:48.480
Um,

646
00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:53.430
all we can say is that this is the kind of cinematic moment when we sort of know

647
00:44:53.431 --> 00:44:55.050
that something is wrong in the room,

648
00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:59.820
but instead the focus is cat this frozen,

649
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.420
fixated and all this refreshing objects,

650
00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:06.480
Vonage wood ash trays and so on.

651
00:45:06.481 --> 00:45:11.481
All this refreshing artists that actually not reflecting the dead body,

652
00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:12.210
right?

653
00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:16.350
So there's a really weird kind of way in which they're multiple mirrors in the

654
00:45:16.351 --> 00:45:20.850
room or this refreshing services,
but they're not reflecting the central,

655
00:45:20.970 --> 00:45:24.810
the most important,
crucial fact in that room.
That's the split that Bali,
um,

656
00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:29.460
on the bed.
Um,
instead they seems simply to be a kind of a meditation.

657
00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:33.240
I'm on the way that the world comes to us refracted and there are multiple

658
00:45:33.241 --> 00:45:36.000
objects to be doing that.
Um,
just,

659
00:45:36.001 --> 00:45:39.390
just and the relation between that and our subconscious and the relation between

660
00:45:39.391 --> 00:45:40.224
that and our memory.

661
00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:45.380
So almost a kind of a meditation on the way in which our memory is structured by

662
00:45:45.571 --> 00:45:48.000
visual refractions.
Um,

663
00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:53.090
and then finally coming back to rosemary and even then repeating exactly the

664
00:45:54.721 --> 00:45:56.190
same sequence right there.

665
00:45:56.191 --> 00:46:01.191
Still woman the four has this dodging little run before she plunges ahead into

666
00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:07.050
her purse to pull out,
um,
the,
the,
the revolver.

667
00:46:07.290 --> 00:46:10.710
And here rosemary is not going to plunge ahead into a purse,

668
00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:13.240
but she's going to do a little,
um,

669
00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:18.260
ballet dance ballet staff before she discovers that Bobby,

670
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:19.303
um,
on guys.

671
00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:24.340
So this is all we can say really is maybe just describe and ree,

672
00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:27.870
um,

673
00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:32.870
ree articulate what Fitzgerald is doing is highly deliberate as highly stylized

674
00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:37.770
for the most stylized moments,
um,
consciously,
um,

675
00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:41.850
maybe even heavy handling,
written,
although what,

676
00:46:41.851 --> 00:46:44.250
for what to what Anne is not entirely clear,

677
00:46:44.251 --> 00:46:48.300
but it's one of the most purposeful moments,
um,
and novel.

678
00:46:48.301 --> 00:46:52.950
And so I think that we're obligated to interpret it in some fashion and to

679
00:46:52.951 --> 00:46:56.730
attach to some degree,
a thematic way,
um,
to this,
um,

680
00:46:56.910 --> 00:47:00.030
seemingly inexplicable moment.
Um,

681
00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:04.830
so always just to say the tenant is now is just real challenge to us as much of

682
00:47:04.831 --> 00:47:07.080
a challenge is Faulkner's novels or.
