00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.930
If there is one generalisation to hazard about
maturity, it is that it involves neither profoundly

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:15.480
idealising, nor denigrating other people.
But let’s begin with babies. The pioneering

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.609
mid-20th century Viennese psychoanalyst Melanie
Klein famously drew attention to something

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:26.930
very dramatic that happens in the minds of
babies during feeding sessions with their

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.970
mothers. Image result for marie cassatt When
feeding goes well, the baby is blissfully

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.930
happy and sees mummy as ‘good’. But if,
for whatever reason, the feeding process is

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.920
difficult, the baby can’t grasp that it
is dealing with the same person it liked a

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:49.270
lot only a few hours or minutes ago. It is
simply filled with rage and hatred. In order

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:55.390
to tolerate this, the baby splits off from
the actual mother a second ‘bad’ version

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.359
– whom it deems to be a separate, hateful
individual, responsible for deliberately frustrating

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:07.240
its wishes, and in the process, protecting
the image of the good mother in its mind.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:14.760
There are, in the baby’s mind, two people
at large, one entirely good, the other entirely

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.990
bad. Gradually, if things go well, there follows
a long and difficult process by which the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:27.090
child integrates these two different people
and comes, sadly but realistically, to grasp

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.790
that there is no ideal, ‘perfect’ mummy
– just one person who is usually lovely

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.920
but can also be cross, busy, tired, who can
make mistakes, and be very interested in other

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:46.010
people. It may be a very long time since we
were being fed as babies. But the tendency

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.460
to ‘split’ those close to us is always
there; for we don’t ever fully outgrow our

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:58.390
childhood selves. In adult life, we may fall
deeply in love and split off an ideal version

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:04.960
of someone, in whom we see no imperfections
and whom we adore without limit. Yet we may

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.030
suddenly and violently turn against the partner
(or a celebrity or a politician) whose good

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.300
qualities once impressed us, the moment we
discover the slightest thing that disturbs

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.230
or frustrates us in them. We may conclude
that they cannot really be good since they

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.070
have made us suffer – and that the only
logical verdict is that they are appalling.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:33.220
We may find it extremely hard to accept that
the same person might be very nice and good

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.920
in some ways and strikingly disappointing
in others. The bad version can appear to destroy

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.190
the good one, though (of course) in fact these
are really just different and connected aspects

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:52.570
of one complex person. It’s a huge psychological
achievement to accept other humans in their

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:59.090
bewildering mixture of good and bad, capacity
to assist us and to frustrate us, kindness

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:05.060
and meanness – and to see that, far more
than we’re inclined to imagine in our furious

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.110
or ecstatic moments, most people belong in
that slightly sobering, slightly hopeful grey

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:17.480
area that goes by the term ‘good enough.’
To cope with the conflict between hope and

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.430
reality, our culture should teach us good
integration skills, prompting us to accept

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.541
with a little more grace what is imperfect
in ourselves – and then, by extension, in

00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:34.800
others. We should be gently reminded that
no one we can love will ever satisfy us completely

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:41.290
– but that this is never a reason to hate
them either. We should move away from the

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:47.830
naivety and cruelty of splitting people into
the camps of the awful and the wondrous, to

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:56.240
the mature wisdom of integrating them into
the large collective of the ‘good enough’.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.470
Our collection of essays, "Why You Will Marry
the Wrong Person" proposes that we don't need

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:08.001
perfection to be happy, as long as we enter
our relationships in the right spirit. Find
