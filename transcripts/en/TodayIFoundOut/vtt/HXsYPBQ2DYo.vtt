Peeing on the Moon... and 7 Other Awesome
Facts

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:05.760
1.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.099
“Hack the System” blogger Maneesh Sethi
once hired a woman for $8 an hour to both

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:13.510
yell at him and slap him anytime she saw him
get off task from what he was supposed to

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:14.950
be doing while working.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.620
He was having trouble staying focused as his
own boss, so thought this would be an easy

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:19.650
and cheap solution.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.480
It turns out, it worked.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.970
His procrastination time while working dropped
from 62% to 2% thanks to his slapping employee.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.610
This man is a genius.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:30.610
(QF 602)

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:31.610
2.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.320
In 2005, a 22 year old man by the name of
Ronald MacDonald robbed a Wendy’s fast-food

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.210
restaurant (stealing the money in the store’s
safe) where he worked at the time.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.210
(QF 591)

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.210
3.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.359
From puberty to death, the average male will
produce enough sperm cells to theoretically

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:51.019
re-populate the entire planet Earth about
405 times at the present population level

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:56.870
of just over 7 billion people, producing about
1,500 sperm cells per second.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.510
The average woman, on the other hand, will
only produce about 450 mature eggs suitable

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.050
for fertilization in her lifetime.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.050
(QF 662)

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.050
4.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.030
In 1670 in France, Louis XIV decreed that
if you committed suicide, your body would

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.100
be dragged through the streets face down and
then placed in a garbage heap.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.780
Any property you may have owned, also would
be forfeit.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.780
(QF 593)

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.780
5.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.920
“Odd” and “Even” are popular names
for male children in Norway, but they have

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.750
nothing to do with mathematics.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.910
The name “Odd”, in this instance, is after
the Old Norse word “Oddr”, a word for

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.530
the “sharp end” of some object or “edge
of a blade”.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.220
“Even”, in this case, is from the Norse
“Eivindr”, which in turn comes from the

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.700
Old Norse “auja-“ and “-winduR”, meaning
“gift” or “winner”.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.700
(QF 595)

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.700
6.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.950
Buzz Aldrin was the first person to pee while
on the surface of the Moon.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.450
Take THAT Neil Armstrong.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.759
(QF 605)

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:49.759
7.

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.720
Hachikō was a dog who would greet his master
Hidesaburō Ueno at the Shibuya Station every

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.049
day for about a year when his master would
come home from work at the University of Tokyo.

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.409
Unfortunately, one day Ueno died while at
work and didn’t come home.

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.070
For the next nine years, until his own death,
the dog would show up when his master’s

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.750
train would arrive and wait for a time before
leaving when it was apparent his master wasn’t

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:12.940
coming home that day.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.490
Hachikō finally died of cancer and was found
on the street on March 8, 1935.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.290
Hachikō’s body was then stuffed and mounted
and can be seen at the National Science Museum

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.830
of Japan in Tokyo.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:25.830
(QF 631)

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:26.830
8.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.290
You should think twice before saying, “When
Hell freezes over.”

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.560
In fact, it freezes over quite frequent in
the small village of Hell, Norway where sub-zero

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.280
temperatures are not that uncommon in the
winter.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:44.450
The name for the town derives from the Old
Norse “hellir,” which meant “cliff cave”

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.500
or “overhang”.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.549
(QF 671)
