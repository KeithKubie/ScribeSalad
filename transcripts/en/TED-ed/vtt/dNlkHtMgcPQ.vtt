00:00:16.143 --> 00:00:19.224
Take an adjective such as "implacable,"

00:00:19.224 --> 00:00:21.758
or a verb like "proliferate,"

00:00:21.758 --> 00:00:24.224
or even another noun, "crony,"

00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:31.160
and add a suffix, such as "-ity," or "-tion," or "-ism."

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.424
You've created a new noun.

00:00:33.424 --> 00:00:38.886
"Implacability," "proliferation," "cronyism."

00:00:38.886 --> 00:00:41.138
Sounds impressive, right?

00:00:41.138 --> 00:00:45.854
Wrong! You've just unleashed a flesh-eating zombie.

00:00:45.854 --> 00:00:50.570
Nouns made from other parts of speech are called nominalizations.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.439
Academics love them.

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:57.554
So do lawyers, bureaucrats, business writers.

00:00:57.554 --> 00:01:02.004
I call them zombie nouns, because they consume the living.

00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:07.305
They cannibalize active verbs, they suck the lifeblood from adjectives,

00:01:07.305 --> 00:01:12.155
and they substitute abstract entities for human beings.

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:14.504
Here's an example.

00:01:14.504 --> 00:01:20.669
"The proliferation of nominalizations in a discursive formation may be an indication

00:01:20.669 --> 00:01:26.137
of a tendency towards pomposity and abstraction." Huh?

00:01:26.137 --> 00:01:31.205
This sentence contains no fewer than seven nominalizations,

00:01:31.205 --> 00:01:34.687
yet it fails to tell us who is doing what.

00:01:34.687 --> 00:01:38.655
When we eliminate, or reanimate, most of the zombie nouns,

00:01:38.655 --> 00:01:44.255
so "tendency" becomes "tend," "abstraction" becomes "abstract,"

00:01:44.255 --> 00:01:47.971
then we add a human subject and some active verbs,

00:01:47.971 --> 00:01:50.888
the sentence springs back to life.

00:01:50.888 --> 00:01:57.756
"Writers who overload their sentences with nominalizations tend to sound pompous and abstract."

00:01:57.756 --> 00:02:02.374
Only one zombie noun -- the key word "nominalizations" --

00:02:02.374 --> 00:02:06.005
has been allowed to remain standing.

00:02:06.005 --> 00:02:10.854
At their best, nominalizations help us express complex ideas,

00:02:10.854 --> 00:02:16.171
perception, intelligence, epistemology.

00:02:16.171 --> 00:02:20.404
At their worst, they impede clear communication.

00:02:20.404 --> 00:02:25.470
To get a feeling for how zombie nouns work, release a few of them into a lively sentence

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.554
and watch them sap all its energy.

00:02:28.554 --> 00:02:33.104
George Orwell played this game in his essay "Politics in the English Language."

00:02:33.104 --> 00:02:38.054
He started with a well-known verse from the book of Ecclesiastes in the Bible.

00:02:38.054 --> 00:02:47.020
It says "I returned and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong,

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:55.088
neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill;

00:02:55.088 --> 00:02:59.920
but time and chance happeneth to them all."

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.289
Now here's Orwell's modern English version.

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:12.737
"Objective considerations of contemporary phenomena compel the conclusion that success or failure in competitive activities

00:03:12.737 --> 00:03:20.005
exhibits no tendency to be commensurate with innate capacity, but that a considerable element of the unpredictable

00:03:20.005 --> 00:03:24.320
must invariably be taken into account."

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.170
The Bible passage speaks to our senses and emotions with concrete nouns,

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.171
descriptions of people, and punchy, abstract nouns such as "race,"

00:03:34.171 --> 00:03:38.670
"battle," "riches," "time," "chance."

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.287
Not a zombie among them.

00:03:41.287 --> 00:03:48.405
Orwell's satirical translation, on the other hand, is teeming with nominalizations and other vague abstractions.

00:03:48.405 --> 00:03:54.988
The zombies have taken over, and the humans have fled the village.

00:03:54.988 --> 00:03:59.670
Zombie nouns do their worst damage when they gather in jargon-generating packs

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.904
and swallow every noun, verb and adjective in sight.

00:04:03.904 --> 00:04:09.387
So "globe" becomes "global," becomes "globalize," becomes "globalization."

00:04:09.387 --> 00:04:15.405
The grandfather of all nominalizations, antidisestablishmentarianism,

00:04:15.405 --> 00:04:20.854
contains at least two verbs, three adjectives, and six other nouns

00:04:20.854 --> 00:04:24.207
inside its distended belly.

00:04:24.207 --> 00:04:30.387
A paragraph heavily populated by nominalizations will send your readers straight to sleep.

00:04:30.387 --> 00:04:35.488
Rescue them from the zombie apocalypse with vigorous verb-driven sentences

00:04:35.488 --> 00:04:38.640
that are concrete and clearly structured.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.586
You want your sentences to live,

00:04:41.586 --> 00:04:46.241
not to join the living dead.
