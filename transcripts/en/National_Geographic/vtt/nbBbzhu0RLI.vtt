00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.835
- For 20 years my
camera's led me

00:00:02.835 --> 00:00:05.938 align:start size:84% position:16%
to some pretty
extraordinary places.

00:00:05.938 --> 00:00:08.842
I could have never imagined
that I would be standing

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:11.877
on the streets of a place
like Pyongyang, North Korea

00:00:11.877 --> 00:00:15.615
and 20 years later I came
back to the United States

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:18.918
with my cameras and it's been
every bit as mind blowing.

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:21.187 line:0%
(applause)

00:00:22.354 --> 00:00:25.291 line:0%
NatGeo spent a year
covering Yellowstone.

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:28.661 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
They had a single topic
issue this summer.

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:31.931 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
There were many
decorated National
Geographic photographers

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:35.201 line:0%
out there but the rest of
them were inside the park

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:39.271 align:start size:88% position:13%
showing the landscapes,
the wild life,

00:00:39.271 --> 00:00:40.806
the biology,

00:00:40.806 --> 00:00:44.510 align:start size:88% position:13%
the tourists, the glory
of our public land.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.813 align:start size:84% position:16%
My job was to stand
outside the boundaries

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:49.716
of Yellowstone National
Park because NatGeo knew

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:51.584 align:start size:88% position:13%
it was just as important
to tell the story

00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:54.921
of the people who live on
the other side of the line

00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:59.125 align:start size:97% position:3%
and what it means to live
adjacent to a national park.

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:01.828 align:start position:0%
On my first day I drove through
Yellowstone National Park

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:03.863
this is what I saw.

00:01:03.863 --> 00:01:06.966 align:start size:84% position:16%
Welcome back to
America, ground zero.

00:01:08.801 --> 00:01:10.736 align:start size:94% position:6%
So I lived my life
outside of the boundaries

00:01:10.736 --> 00:01:12.105
of the park.

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:14.006 align:start size:97% position:3%
Little towns like Livingston,
I photographed them

00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:15.341
in the same way that
I photographed my life

00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:17.810 align:start size:81% position:19%
in North Korea
and anywhere else.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.513
In the bars where I ate
dinner, on main streets.

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:23.082 align:start size:84% position:16%
I started my own new
Instagram series,

00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:25.384
I called this one Work Commute.

00:01:25.384 --> 00:01:28.454
Work Commute wasn't only
to make all of the editors

00:01:28.454 --> 00:01:30.856 align:start size:97% position:3%
jealous that they were
sitting in an office all day

00:01:30.856 --> 00:01:32.325
and this is where I was working.

00:01:32.325 --> 00:01:34.160 align:start size:94% position:6%
It was also that idea
that we could take people

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.595
out into the field.

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:37.931
That a National Geographic story
lasts for an entire year

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:41.200 align:start size:84% position:16%
so why not bring
people along with you.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.303
I had another series
#dogsinpickuptrucks.

00:01:44.303 --> 00:01:46.573
(laughter)

00:01:47.974 --> 00:01:49.441 align:start size:97% position:3%
but what National Geographic
really wanted me to do

00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:51.811
in Yellowstone was tackle issues

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:54.713
and mainly they wanted me
to look at the conflict

00:01:54.713 --> 00:01:57.816
and confluence between
people and wildlife.

00:01:57.816 --> 00:02:00.453
The first thing that
I covered were bison.

00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:03.957 align:start size:94% position:6%
Bison have had a very dark
history in our country.

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:06.826
We once had 50 maybe
60 million of them

00:02:06.826 --> 00:02:08.061
roaming North America.

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:10.863
We killed them down
to just a handful

00:02:10.863 --> 00:02:12.231
but it was also the moment

00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:16.069 align:start size:84% position:16%
when human beings
looked after animals

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.237 align:start size:84% position:16%
and the conservation
movement was born

00:02:18.237 --> 00:02:20.172
and they brought them
back from extinction

00:02:20.172 --> 00:02:22.108
and now the core DNA...

00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:25.378 align:start size:81% position:19%
American Bison
that we have today

00:02:25.378 --> 00:02:29.014
live inside Pelican Valley
in Yellowstone National Park

00:02:29.014 --> 00:02:31.917
but they only have room for
four, maybe 5000 of them

00:02:31.917 --> 00:02:34.254
and every year they come
out and cross the line

00:02:34.254 --> 00:02:38.191
and wander into our yards
and into our highways.

00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:41.460
The bison was named our
national mammal this year

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.296 align:start size:84% position:16%
and yet in the
west in many places

00:02:44.296 --> 00:02:46.866 align:start size:84% position:16%
it's still registered
as livestock.

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:49.802 align:start size:88% position:13%
Can you imagine the
bald eagle as livestock,

00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:51.771
kept in a chicken coop?

00:02:51.771 --> 00:02:55.608 align:start size:97% position:3%
They're not that loved
actually by a lot of people

00:02:55.608 --> 00:02:57.677
in the west because of...

00:02:59.178 --> 00:03:01.781 align:start size:88% position:13%
The proximity that
they live to the parks.

00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:04.017
Who couldn't love this guy?

00:03:05.284 --> 00:03:07.419 align:start size:81% position:19%
He was being- this is a
Yellowstone bison,

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:09.588
he was being tagged and tested

00:03:09.588 --> 00:03:11.891 align:start size:84% position:16%
for a disease
called Brucellosis.

00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:13.058
Many people don't love bison

00:03:13.058 --> 00:03:14.593
because they fear this disease

00:03:14.593 --> 00:03:16.829
and that they will transfer
this disease to their cattle

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.699 align:start size:84% position:16%
once they cross
outside of Yellowstone

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:22.435 align:start size:97% position:3%
and this bison tested positive
and this is how they dealt

00:03:22.435 --> 00:03:23.368
with it.

00:03:23.368 --> 00:03:25.772
Very quickly, execution style.

00:03:26.906 --> 00:03:28.307 align:start size:81% position:19%
So they're looking
for solutions,

00:03:28.307 --> 00:03:30.810
how to manage bison,
how to deal with them

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:31.844
how to protect them

00:03:31.844 --> 00:03:35.214
but also live with them.

00:03:35.214 --> 00:03:39.318 align:start size:97% position:3%
And one of the solutions is
Native American hunting rights

00:03:39.318 --> 00:03:42.588
as the bison cross
over into our land

00:03:42.588 --> 00:03:44.289
outside of public land,

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:47.393 align:start size:88% position:13%
they give a certain number
of hunting licenses

00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:48.627
to the native peoples.

00:03:48.627 --> 00:03:51.930
I had the privilege of
going with these men

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.967
and watching them as
they hunted this bison

00:03:54.967 --> 00:03:59.338 align:start size:94% position:6%
and ceremoniously removing
its heart in a field

00:03:59.338 --> 00:04:00.807
and they've started
a new program too

00:04:00.807 --> 00:04:04.177 align:start size:97% position:3%
where they instead of killing
them they round them up

00:04:04.177 --> 00:04:06.212 align:start size:88% position:13%
put them in these
trucks and ship them off

00:04:06.212 --> 00:04:08.013 align:start size:84% position:16%
to the Native
America Reservations

00:04:08.013 --> 00:04:11.317
because native peoples
have a direct connection

00:04:11.317 --> 00:04:12.851
to the bison.

00:04:12.851 --> 00:04:15.554
When this truck arrived in
Fort Belknap in the north

00:04:15.554 --> 00:04:18.357
of Montana they let out school,

00:04:18.357 --> 00:04:20.792
all the kids came,
all the elders came

00:04:20.792 --> 00:04:22.595
and people celebrated
as they let them go

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:26.132 align:start size:84% position:16%
and let them lose
on their land again.

00:04:26.132 --> 00:04:28.100
I photographed elk.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.672
It's probably the animal
that's maybe the pulse

00:04:32.672 --> 00:04:33.939
of Yellowstone.

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:37.009
It's what the bears
and the wolves eat.

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:40.479 align:start position:0%
It's also what brings in
millions of tourists every year.

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:42.848
These beautiful animals
that you can see them

00:04:42.848 --> 00:04:44.683
practically no other place.

00:04:44.683 --> 00:04:47.053
But again outside of the line

00:04:47.053 --> 00:04:48.687
people see them a
very different way.

00:04:48.687 --> 00:04:51.490
There's almost a cult of hunting

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.759
and it's big business too.

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:55.928
So I tried to go
right on the line

00:04:55.928 --> 00:04:59.465 align:start size:97% position:3%
that separates the park
from the rest of the state.

00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:01.000 align:start size:81% position:19%
This line right
behind the hunter,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.203
that's the actual boundary
of Yellowstone National Park

00:05:04.203 --> 00:05:07.839
and the hunters come here, put
themselves right on the line

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:10.108 align:start size:84% position:16%
and wait for elk to
come up over the hill.

00:05:10.108 --> 00:05:12.211
The elk know where that
line is, it's amazing.

00:05:12.211 --> 00:05:14.446 align:start size:94% position:6%
When they cross it's
like they just saunter in

00:05:14.446 --> 00:05:18.618
home free but when they don't
like this one on the right,

00:05:20.086 --> 00:05:24.290
the hunter shot him, he
stood up, he struggled,

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.592
trying to get to the line
and he shot him again,

00:05:26.592 --> 00:05:28.861 align:start size:94% position:6%
he slid right to the
line and the hunter said,

00:05:28.861 --> 00:05:30.362 align:start size:97% position:3%
"It's a good thing he didn't
make it to the other side

00:05:30.362 --> 00:05:33.466
"cause we wouldn't have been
able to retrieve him legally."

00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:37.069
This is not a hunter, this
is a biologist darting a wolf

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:38.203
for research purposes.

00:05:38.203 --> 00:05:39.972 align:start size:88% position:13%
Wolves were reintroduced
into Yellowstone

00:05:39.972 --> 00:05:43.976
in the mid-1990s because

00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:45.211
they didn't believe

00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:48.080
that the ecosystem
could be healthy

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.716 align:start size:84% position:16%
without an alpha
predator like the wolf

00:05:50.716 --> 00:05:52.718
and they're loved
inside the park.

00:05:52.718 --> 00:05:55.587 align:start size:97% position:3%
Tourists name them, they
watch them with remote cameras

00:05:55.587 --> 00:05:57.489
from laptops in their homes,

00:05:57.489 --> 00:06:00.058
they have tattoos on
their arms of wolves

00:06:00.058 --> 00:06:01.627
and when they see them
through a spotting scope

00:06:01.627 --> 00:06:03.463
they break down in tears.

00:06:03.463 --> 00:06:06.232
It's quite amazing but
again outside of the park

00:06:06.232 --> 00:06:08.033
it's a different story.

00:06:08.033 --> 00:06:12.104 align:start size:97% position:3%
Ranchers fear them because
they come onto their property,

00:06:12.104 --> 00:06:14.640
they eat their livestock

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.810
and actually they just see
them in many ways as demons,

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.278
the big bad wolf.

00:06:19.278 --> 00:06:23.582 align:start size:97% position:3%
And these are not people
who are used to doing things

00:06:23.582 --> 00:06:27.953 align:start size:97% position:3%
any other way than settling
them in their own way.

00:06:27.953 --> 00:06:31.456
They told me, "we're used
to living with wolves now

00:06:31.456 --> 00:06:32.991 align:start size:84% position:16%
and we know that
they're here to stay

00:06:32.991 --> 00:06:34.860 align:start size:97% position:3%
but we don't like the
federal government telling us

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:35.795
what to do."

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:41.666 align:start size:94% position:6%
But they're learning to
live with wolves and bears

00:06:41.666 --> 00:06:43.969
and they're learning to ranch

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:46.205
and to live their
lives differently.

00:06:46.205 --> 00:06:47.906
They used to just
send these sheep up

00:06:47.906 --> 00:06:50.309
into national forest
land and let them graze

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:51.777
for the season all alone

00:06:51.777 --> 00:06:55.481 align:start position:0%
but now they go with them, they
sleep every night out there

00:06:55.481 --> 00:06:57.850 align:start size:81% position:19%
with the sheep and
I did this too.

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.452
I followed them all
the way to the top

00:06:59.452 --> 00:07:01.554
of the Gravelly Mountains.

00:07:02.988 --> 00:07:05.490
The animal that's on most
peoples minds right now

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:06.926
are grizzly bears.

00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:09.762 align:start size:97% position:3%
Grizzlies have been protected
as an endangered species

00:07:09.762 --> 00:07:12.732
for something like 40 years

00:07:12.732 --> 00:07:15.802
and maybe as a sign
of their recovery

00:07:17.202 --> 00:07:19.739
the numbers are greater,
they're coming further down

00:07:19.739 --> 00:07:23.776 align:start position:0%
into lower lands, they're
becoming a bit more habituated.

00:07:23.776 --> 00:07:28.013
Now we find them in the
front lawns eating apples

00:07:28.013 --> 00:07:29.582
out of our apple trees.

00:07:29.582 --> 00:07:34.053 align:start size:84% position:16%
This is Dusty,
he's a bear trapper

00:07:34.053 --> 00:07:35.687
for the state of Montana.

00:07:35.687 --> 00:07:38.524
He's sort of like a dog catcher

00:07:38.524 --> 00:07:40.125
or like a beat cop.

00:07:40.125 --> 00:07:41.894 align:start size:81% position:19%
He goes around,
he educates people

00:07:41.894 --> 00:07:43.562
how to protect their garbage

00:07:43.562 --> 00:07:46.766 align:start size:88% position:13%
and how to protect bears
by not allowing them

00:07:46.766 --> 00:07:48.533
to become habituated

00:07:48.533 --> 00:07:50.536
but he also gets his 911 calls,

00:07:50.536 --> 00:07:53.439
"Hey there's a bear
on my roof again."

00:07:53.439 --> 00:07:55.907 align:start size:97% position:3%
and they go and they dart
them and they bring them back

00:07:55.907 --> 00:07:59.946
to the garage and they sometimes

00:07:59.946 --> 00:08:03.615 align:start size:94% position:6%
euthanize them if the
bear becomes too difficult

00:08:03.615 --> 00:08:05.084
to deal with

00:08:05.084 --> 00:08:08.120 align:start size:94% position:6%
but usually like this
bear, they tag their ear,

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.758 align:start size:97% position:3%
they brush their teeth,
they give them inoculations

00:08:12.758 --> 00:08:15.594
and then they drive them from
Wyoming to the Montana border

00:08:15.594 --> 00:08:17.262
and they let them go
on the other side.

00:08:17.262 --> 00:08:20.766 align:start position:0%
And the bear catchers in
Montana told me the same thing.

00:08:20.766 --> 00:08:24.036
They bring them into
Wyoming, open the door,

00:08:24.036 --> 00:08:25.972
let em go into Wyoming.

00:08:28.406 --> 00:08:30.242
This man's name is Nick Patrick.

00:08:30.242 --> 00:08:32.745
He knows better than
anyone what it means

00:08:32.745 --> 00:08:35.748
to live on that line,
to live with the wild,

00:08:35.748 --> 00:08:37.583
to live with bears.

00:08:37.583 --> 00:08:41.954
He's a rancher from Wyoming.

00:08:41.954 --> 00:08:44.490
One day he was walking in
his yard with his dogs,

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:46.992 align:start size:84% position:16%
his dogs start barking
and they ran off

00:08:46.992 --> 00:08:48.260
into the willow trees.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.163
He thought maybe they
were chasing a raccoon

00:08:51.163 --> 00:08:53.565
so he walked in behind them,

00:08:53.565 --> 00:08:55.033
he didn't have his bear spray

00:08:55.033 --> 00:08:57.403 align:start size:84% position:16%
and he found himself
suddenly caught

00:08:57.403 --> 00:09:02.441 align:start size:94% position:6%
between a huge sow grizzly
bear and her two cubs.

00:09:02.842 --> 00:09:06.745 align:start size:97% position:3%
Before he could do anything,
the grizzly was on him.

00:09:06.745 --> 00:09:10.917
He said with one swipe it
took off his entire face.

00:09:12.652 --> 00:09:15.454
He fell to the ground, it
mauled him, he played dead,

00:09:15.454 --> 00:09:16.722
she let him go.

00:09:18.157 --> 00:09:21.026 align:start size:94% position:6%
As she was walking away
he reached into his pocket

00:09:21.026 --> 00:09:22.227
to see if he had something

00:09:22.227 --> 00:09:25.831 align:start size:88% position:13%
to protect himself,
she turned and saw him.

00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:27.733 align:start size:84% position:16%
She was on him again,
she mauled him,

00:09:27.733 --> 00:09:30.369
dragged him by his leg.

00:09:30.369 --> 00:09:31.771
She let him live.

00:09:33.205 --> 00:09:35.841 align:start size:94% position:6%
He walked back from the
willow trees into his barn

00:09:35.841 --> 00:09:39.879
and he found a shop rag
and he covered his face

00:09:39.879 --> 00:09:42.648
so that he could go
and tell his wife

00:09:42.648 --> 00:09:44.182
and his children that
he'd been injured.

00:09:44.182 --> 00:09:47.052
He didn't want them to see
what had happened to him.

00:09:47.052 --> 00:09:48.587
And he walked in the
house and told them to,

00:09:48.587 --> 00:09:50.756
"Take me to the hospital."

00:09:51.857 --> 00:09:53.525 align:start size:84% position:16%
When we first
started this project

00:09:53.525 --> 00:09:57.996
we wanted to photograph Nick
because Nick tells that story

00:09:57.996 --> 00:10:01.233 align:start size:88% position:13%
of living with wild
better than anyone else

00:10:01.233 --> 00:10:02.835 align:start size:94% position:6%
but he said he didn't want
to be photographed then

00:10:02.835 --> 00:10:04.636
because he hadn't had the
reconstructive surgery

00:10:04.636 --> 00:10:06.472
that you see in this picture.

00:10:06.472 --> 00:10:11.210 align:start size:97% position:3%
He hadn't been given this
new prosthetic silicone nose

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:14.546
and he said, "I don't want to
be photographed like this yet"

00:10:14.546 --> 00:10:17.449 align:start size:84% position:16%
and it wasn't
because Nick is vain,

00:10:17.449 --> 00:10:19.985
it's because Nick said,
"I don't want my face

00:10:19.985 --> 00:10:23.455
to tell the wrong story
and scare people away."

00:10:23.455 --> 00:10:26.926
because Nick believes that
we have to live with the wild

00:10:26.926 --> 00:10:31.330 align:start position:0%
and Nick says that, "That
mother was doing what any mother

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:33.632 align:start size:81% position:19%
"would do, protect
her children."

00:10:33.632 --> 00:10:36.101 align:start size:97% position:3%
and Nick said, "I want my face
to tell a different story,

00:10:36.101 --> 00:10:37.369
"I want it to tell a story

00:10:37.369 --> 00:10:39.337
"of how we should
protect the land

00:10:39.337 --> 00:10:40.806 align:start size:84% position:16%
"and we should
protect the wild life

00:10:40.806 --> 00:10:43.009 align:start size:94% position:6%
"and that we have to
learn to live among them."

00:10:44.276 --> 00:10:48.980 align:start size:97% position:3%
So National Geographic
spent this entire year 2016

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:50.616
photographing national parks.

00:10:50.616 --> 00:10:53.885
This was the centennial of the
creation of the park service.

00:10:53.885 --> 00:10:56.655
Every issue had a story
about a national park

00:10:56.655 --> 00:10:58.757
and I tried to go to
as many as I could too

00:10:58.757 --> 00:11:00.426
now that I was back in America.

00:11:00.426 --> 00:11:04.730
I took my children, we
went to the Badlands,

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:07.900 align:start size:94% position:6%
we went to the Everglades
and I hung around

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:11.203 align:start size:84% position:16%
with these invasive
python hunters

00:11:11.203 --> 00:11:12.838
and I went to Yosemite.

00:11:12.838 --> 00:11:17.276 align:start position:0%
I got to go with President
Obama to Yosemite National Park.

00:11:17.276 --> 00:11:20.913 align:start size:88% position:13%
He was there on fathers'
day to tour the park

00:11:20.913 --> 00:11:25.351
with his family but also
to announce even more land

00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:29.522 align:start size:97% position:3%
and seas that he and our
government decided to protect.

00:11:31.056 --> 00:11:34.926
With that announcement
he solidified his legacy

00:11:34.926 --> 00:11:37.362
as the best president
that we've ever had

00:11:37.362 --> 00:11:40.165 align:start size:97% position:3%
for conservation, protecting
more land and seas

00:11:40.165 --> 00:11:42.968
than any other before him.

00:11:42.968 --> 00:11:46.171 align:start size:97% position:3%
I got the chance to walk
through the forest with him.

00:11:46.171 --> 00:11:48.941 align:start size:84% position:16%
Just me and a
couple of cameramen

00:11:48.941 --> 00:11:51.042
and at the end he
shook our hands

00:11:51.042 --> 00:11:53.712
and I thanked him and he said,

00:11:53.712 --> 00:11:55.915
"Hey, aren't you the guy
who took all those pictures

00:11:55.915 --> 00:11:57.049
in North Korea?"

00:11:57.049 --> 00:11:59.084
(laughter)

00:11:59.084 --> 00:12:01.987 align:start size:88% position:13%
I said "Yes," and I said
"What did you think?"

00:12:01.987 --> 00:12:04.490
and he said, "It's good,
I think it was important

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:06.992
"we got to see something
we don't normally see."

00:12:06.992 --> 00:12:09.828
and he started to walk
away and he turned around

00:12:09.828 --> 00:12:12.297
and he said, "Hey, just
be careful over there,

00:12:12.297 --> 00:12:13.598
"I don't want to have
to come over there

00:12:13.598 --> 00:12:15.167
"and rescue you and
bring you back home."

00:12:15.167 --> 00:12:17.436
(laughter)

00:12:19.971 --> 00:12:23.709
but I made it home,
exactly 20 years

00:12:23.709 --> 00:12:25.911
from the time that I left.

00:12:27.579 --> 00:12:29.514
It was actually 4th
of July the first day

00:12:29.514 --> 00:12:31.049
that I came back.

00:12:31.049 --> 00:12:34.352
I went to my sister's house,
she had a 4th of July party.

00:12:34.352 --> 00:12:37.823
Now that I'm home, I
guess I kind of often

00:12:37.823 --> 00:12:40.125 align:start size:84% position:16%
feel like a stranger
in a strange land

00:12:40.125 --> 00:12:41.927
after being away for so long

00:12:41.927 --> 00:12:45.597
and so I notice and I
photograph the things

00:12:45.597 --> 00:12:48.233 align:start size:84% position:16%
that maybe outsiders
would notice.

00:12:48.233 --> 00:12:50.602
All the patriotism and the flags

00:12:50.602 --> 00:12:53.872
and the sugary diet that we have

00:12:54.072 --> 00:12:56.408
and maybe I'm a little critical

00:12:56.408 --> 00:12:59.011
but I also know that
my sister made these

00:12:59.011 --> 00:13:01.113
and so I also feel love

00:13:01.113 --> 00:13:04.550 align:start position:0%
and I also feel like
I'm happy to be home again.

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:07.986
This is my front yard
where I moved back to.

00:13:07.986 --> 00:13:12.957 align:start position:0%
This is the frozen lake outside
of the house I'm living in.

00:13:12.957 --> 00:13:15.060
Those are my footsteps
going out onto the lake

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.429
and back to my yard.

00:13:17.429 --> 00:13:21.634
I had to go quite far
out into the world

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:22.634
for a long time

00:13:22.634 --> 00:13:26.639
to feel like I could answer

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:29.908 align:start size:97% position:3%
that voice in my head and
that I could find my purpose

00:13:29.908 --> 00:13:33.479
and that I could bring
that purpose back intact

00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:36.882
and that I could notice all
the little bits of beauty

00:13:36.882 --> 00:13:40.018 align:start size:97% position:3%
right here in my own country
and in my own back yard.

00:13:40.018 --> 00:13:42.955
And so maybe for most
of you, you didn't have

00:13:42.955 --> 00:13:44.355
to quite go so far.

00:13:44.355 --> 00:13:45.958
You knew that from the beginning

00:13:46.525 --> 00:13:49.260
but for me I had
to go a long way

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:50.695
before I could come back home.

00:13:50.695 --> 00:13:53.699 align:start size:97% position:3%
So I want to end by just
thanking National Geographic

00:13:53.699 --> 00:13:56.068 align:start size:84% position:16%
because they
brought me back home

00:13:56.068 --> 00:13:57.969 align:start size:84% position:16%
and they're still
sending me out there

00:13:57.969 --> 00:14:01.607 align:start size:84% position:16%
into the wild so
thank you very much.

00:14:01.607 --> 00:14:03.843
(applause)
