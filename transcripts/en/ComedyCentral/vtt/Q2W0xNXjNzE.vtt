00:00:03.302 --> 00:00:07.340
- So is monogamy a bad
thing in your opinion?

00:00:07.373 --> 00:00:11.277
- Long-term sexual
monogamy is not congruent

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:12.812
with our species.

00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:16.182
I look at monogamy as being
akin to vegetarianism.

00:00:16.215 --> 00:00:17.984
- So like annoying.

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:19.452
- Potentially annoying.

00:00:19.485 --> 00:00:20.286
- Okay.

00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:21.821
- You can choose to be a
vegetarian,

00:00:21.854 --> 00:00:23.356
but you are still an omnivore.

00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:25.491
You can't choose to be an
herbivore.

00:00:25.524 --> 00:00:26.425
- Yes.

00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:27.894
- They're still gonna smell the
barbecue.

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:29.462
It's still gonna smell good.

00:00:29.495 --> 00:00:31.831
- Pretty much we're made to
like fuck a lot of people.

00:00:31.864 --> 00:00:32.799
- Exactly.

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:35.401
- So I'm here today because I
want to find

00:00:35.434 --> 00:00:38.171
a girl for my boyfriend to have
sex with.

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:40.740
You don't think that I'm like
weird?

00:00:40.773 --> 00:00:43.910
- No, I think you're weird, of
course.

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:47.180
- Everyone who's been
disapproving of this,

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:49.582
my therapist, my mom, God.

00:00:49.615 --> 00:00:51.317
Even worse, Dr. Drew.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.218
- Dr. Drew?

00:00:52.251 --> 00:00:54.153
- Dr. Drew told me not to do it.

00:00:54.186 --> 00:00:55.988
- But Dr. Dre is find with it.

00:00:56.021 --> 00:00:57.757
- Dr. Dre would be fine with it.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.192
(laughter)

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:00.359
- Society doesn't approve of
this,

00:01:00.392 --> 00:01:02.261
but hey, five years ago,
society didn't approve

00:01:02.294 --> 00:01:03.996
of medical marijuana.

00:01:04.029 --> 00:01:05.331
It didn't approve gay marriage.

00:01:05.364 --> 00:01:06.666
It didn't approve a lot of
things.

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:08.267
Society needs to grow up.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.669
So I think what you're doing is
good.

00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:11.737
It's revolutionary.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:12.738
It's important.

00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:14.207
- A lot of people who
have told me I should

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.243
not be doing this say,
"You're gonna be jealous."

00:01:17.276 --> 00:01:18.845
- Which makes perfect sense.

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:21.681
There's a heightened sense
of connecting with the person

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:24.584
because there's maybe a danger
that you're losing them.

00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:26.085
- So it's a risk, you know?

00:01:26.118 --> 00:01:27.920
- Yeah, like rock climbing.

00:01:27.953 --> 00:01:28.921
- Exactly.

00:01:28.954 --> 00:01:30.556
And I'm just picking the
rock he's going to climb

00:01:30.589 --> 00:01:33.926
and have sex with.

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:37.763
So you think that it's maybe
healthy for my relationship.

00:01:37.796 --> 00:01:39.866
- If it's something that
you both want to do,

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:41.400
then why not, yeah.

00:01:41.433 --> 00:01:43.136
The hell with Dr. Drew.

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:44.270
- Thank you.

00:01:44.303 --> 00:01:46.572
- Good luck.

00:01:46.605 --> 00:01:47.406
- Hello, hi.

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:47.973
- Hey, how's it going?

00:01:48.006 --> 00:01:48.608
- [Blonde girl] Nikki?

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:49.442
- Yes.

00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:50.243
- [Blonde girl] Hi, nice to meet
you.

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:51.244
- Likewise.

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:53.079
- I'm interviewing you
to date my boyfriend.

00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:53.646
- Yes.

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:54.280
- Okay.

00:01:54.313 --> 00:01:55.314
If you get the job..

00:01:55.347 --> 00:01:56.382
- [Brunette girl] Mm-hmm.

00:01:56.415 --> 00:01:57.583
- You and my boyfriend can
go and do whatever it is

00:01:57.616 --> 00:01:59.785
you two wanna do, no questions
asked.

00:01:59.818 --> 00:02:00.820
- And you're okay with that?

00:02:00.853 --> 00:02:02.588
- Yeah, I am.

00:02:02.621 --> 00:02:05.558
Tell me why you would be
good for this position.

00:02:05.591 --> 00:02:07.160
- I know how to please a man.

00:02:07.193 --> 00:02:08.794
- I am super funny.

00:02:08.827 --> 00:02:10.263
- How funny are you?

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:11.931
Because that's kind of my thing.

00:02:11.964 --> 00:02:13.466
- Oh, yeah.

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:15.268
Not funnier than you.

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:16.169
- Okay, okay.

00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:17.403
What do you look for in a guy?

00:02:17.436 --> 00:02:18.638
- I like 'em tall.

00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:20.406
- I really like black guys.

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:21.674
- I'm cool with that, too.

00:02:21.707 --> 00:02:22.775
Boom.

00:02:22.808 --> 00:02:23.910
- Hello.

00:02:23.943 --> 00:02:25.144
This is your boyfriend?

00:02:25.177 --> 00:02:26.078
Damn.

00:02:26.111 --> 00:02:26.945
- [Blonde girl] Yeah.

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:28.114
- Hit it, man, his straight-ass
teeth.

00:02:28.147 --> 00:02:29.348
- Would you lick those teeth?

00:02:29.382 --> 00:02:31.618
- I would honestly suck the
white out of that guy's teeth.

00:02:32.985 --> 00:02:34.287
- You got a hottie on your
hands.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.521
- You could sit on that.

00:02:35.554 --> 00:02:36.656
- I could sit on that, yeah.

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:37.156
- Okay.

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:39.592
Could sit on.

00:02:39.625 --> 00:02:41.093
My boyfriend knows what's wrong
with me,

00:02:41.126 --> 00:02:42.962
so what is wrong with you?

00:02:42.995 --> 00:02:44.130
- I'm hard-headed.

00:02:44.163 --> 00:02:44.830
I'm a bull.

00:02:44.863 --> 00:02:45.531
I'm Taurus.

00:02:45.564 --> 00:02:46.799
- Oh, so you're into astrology.

00:02:46.832 --> 00:02:47.867
- [Girl on right] A little bit.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.001
- That's what's wrong with you,
okay.

00:02:49.034 --> 00:02:50.469
How good at sex are you?

00:02:50.502 --> 00:02:51.370
- Awesome.

00:02:51.403 --> 00:02:52.505
- I'm really good at sex.

00:02:52.538 --> 00:02:53.206
- Like how good?

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.440
- I do porn.

00:02:54.473 --> 00:02:55.441
- You do porn?

00:02:55.474 --> 00:02:56.442
- Yeah.

00:02:56.475 --> 00:02:57.443
I actually did my first
interracial gang bang

00:02:57.476 --> 00:02:58.377
like a week ago.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.145
- So did I.

00:02:59.178 --> 00:03:00.680
- Everybody's doing it.

00:03:00.713 --> 00:03:03.149
- Now, tell me, what is
your like best skill in bed?

00:03:03.182 --> 00:03:06.319
- The cowboy on top maybe.

00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:07.687
- Way too spicy.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.124
On a scale of a limp handshake
to a like vice grip pliers,

00:03:12.157 --> 00:03:13.626
like how tight are you?

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.062
- Oh, I'm pretty tight.

00:03:16.095 --> 00:03:16.696
- Really?

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:17.997
- Yeah, I'm really little.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.234
- It's actually tighter
than I'd like it to be.

00:03:21.267 --> 00:03:23.135
- You wish you weren't as tight.

00:03:23.168 --> 00:03:25.338
Oh, you poor thing.

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:27.540
- Actually, it's itty-bitty.

00:03:27.573 --> 00:03:29.008
Itty-bitty kitty.

00:03:29.041 --> 00:03:30.743
- Mine looks like it's trying to
escape.

00:03:30.776 --> 00:03:32.245
Do you ever have that feeling?

00:03:32.278 --> 00:03:33.646
- No, I haven't.

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:34.981
- Can you give me an example of
a sound

00:03:35.014 --> 00:03:37.049
you would make during sex?

00:03:37.082 --> 00:03:40.720
- Uh, uh, uh,

00:03:40.753 --> 00:03:44.257
oh, God, yeah.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.258
Is that good?

00:03:45.291 --> 00:03:46.359
- No.

00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:47.927
(laughter)

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:48.928
Fuck.
