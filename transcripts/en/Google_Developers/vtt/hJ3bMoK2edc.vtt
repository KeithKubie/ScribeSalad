KORY JEFFREY: Welcome, everyone.

00:00:01.515 --> 00:00:04.590
We are at Founder
World in San Francisco.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.320
I have in the studio with
me Cody, a chief astronaut

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.691
at RockIT.

00:00:08.691 --> 00:00:09.982
Thank you for joining me, Cody.

00:00:09.982 --> 00:00:10.414
CODY VOELLINGER: Yeah.

00:00:10.414 --> 00:00:11.669
Thanks for having me.

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:13.460
KORY JEFFREY: So what
is RockIT Recruiting?

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.290
What do you guys do?

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.140
CODY VOELLINGER: So RockIT has
been around for four years.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.740
And we partner with
local VCs and help

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.020
build their portfolio companies
when it becomes time for them

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.870
to start scaling their
engineering teams.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.400
So at this point, we've helped
hundreds of different startups

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.680
in the Bay Area hire hundreds
of engineers, product managers,

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.264
and designers.

00:00:38.264 --> 00:00:39.180
KORY JEFFREY: Awesome.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.935
So do you guys have
a specific philosophy

00:00:40.935 --> 00:00:42.874
about how you go
about doing that?

00:00:42.874 --> 00:00:43.790
CODY VOELLINGER: Yeah.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.440
We are bringing recruiting
back to its old school,

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.520
traditional roots
while using cutting

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.520
edge technology to do so.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.490
So what I mean by that is
bringing the relationship back

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:58.280
to recruiting.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.250
We've got our office here
in SoMa at 5th and Harrison.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.760
And we have sponsored
hackathon teams, given them

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.150
crushed velour tracksuits
with branded RockIT Recruiting

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.580
to represent us.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.520
We've sponsored
tech trivia events

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.980
at local pubs like pub trivia.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.340
We just did an interview
training series

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.610
with Gayle McDowell, who
wrote "Cracking the Coding

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.660
Interview."

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.510
So a whole series of
events to build our brand

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.560
within the developer
and startup community.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.040
And that's on the
candidate side of things.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.860
On the client side, every
company that we work with,

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.640
we've visited their office.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.720
We've sat down with
the founders, the heads

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.030
of engineering, and
talked to them about,

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.900
what do you need to
build a successful team?

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.890
And how can we help with that?

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.730
And the reason we
take all the time

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.130
to make those two connections
is because hiring is

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.730
difficult and time consuming.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.310
And finding a job is
stressful and time consuming.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.570
And so we want to take
all of the pain out

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.892
of that for both sides and help
to make a high quality match.

00:02:10.892 --> 00:02:12.370
KORY JEFFREY:
That's pretty cool.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.060
So what is the craziest thing
that somebody's ever asked you

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.630
to do for a recruiting purpose?

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.130
CODY VOELLINGER:
This actually dates

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.640
back to my time
recruiting in Tokyo,

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.280
which is where I started
my recruiting career.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.350
I found a job for a lady.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.420
And we went out for
a celebration dinner.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.530
And she very
seriously said, Cody,

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.790
you've done such an amazing
job finding me a company that

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.760
matches exactly what I need.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.627
I'd like you to
recruit me a husband.

00:02:44.627 --> 00:02:45.502
KORY JEFFREY: Really?

00:02:45.502 --> 00:02:46.880
CODY VOELLINGER: Yeah.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.640
KORY JEFFREY: So
small step, I suppose,

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.620
between recruiting for a job
and recruiting for a husband.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.036
CODY VOELLINGER:
Everyone compares

00:02:52.036 --> 00:02:54.650
interviewing and hiring
to dating all the time.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.740
That analogy is very prevalent.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.360
So yeah.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.975
She went for it.

00:02:59.975 --> 00:03:02.466
I had to politely decline.

00:03:02.466 --> 00:03:03.674
KORY JEFFREY: That's awesome.

00:03:03.674 --> 00:03:05.090
CODY VOELLINGER:
But it was funny.

00:03:07.547 --> 00:03:09.130
KORY JEFFREY: But
being serious, there

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.870
is a pretty close connection
with how personal it

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:12.880
is on both sides.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.590
So finding a job,
finding an employer.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.395
How do you do that at scale?

00:03:17.395 --> 00:03:19.144
Because obviously, as
your company grows,

00:03:19.144 --> 00:03:20.560
personal relationships
can be more

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.480
difficult to do on a one
on one basis like this.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.890
How do you do that?

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.200
CODY VOELLINGER: That is tough.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.570
That's part of why we exist.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:37.430
So as a startup, you're
10, 20, 30, 40 people.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.330
You don't have time to be
sending thousands of emails,

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.730
having hundreds of conversations
to make those four or five

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.330
hires with people
that are going to fit.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.900
And that's why you
outsource that to us.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.890
So recruiting is a
value add because it

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.580
saves time and
provides a service

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.915
to both sides of the equation.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.610
That's why companies
rely on us to do that.

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.125
And we don't have a solution,
other than a lot of hard work.

00:04:13.125 --> 00:04:16.110
There is no silver bullet
to automate the recruiting

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.540
process.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.050
One of the things that
we've done recently

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.320
that we're pretty excited
about is we just brought

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.890
in an expert storyteller.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.080
He was an editor at Time
magazine for a long time.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.750
He's been a part of startups.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.550
And he's done a couple
training sessions with our team

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.350
on how do you tell
a compelling story.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.430
So that when we go to
visit the companies,

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.400
even if they don't have their
own compelling story created,

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.730
we can create that for them.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.226
And we can help them to
distribute that message

00:04:47.226 --> 00:04:51.140
and identify who's actually
going to be a quality fit so we

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.802
can make that introduction.

00:04:53.802 --> 00:04:55.260
KORY JEFFREY: I
mean, you have seen

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.970
quite a few technical people
get matched and find their dream

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:59.470
job.

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.470
You've also seen quite a few
probably not be successful.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.480
What would your advice
be to technical people?

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.210
We have quite a few technical
people that watch this channel.

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.834
What would your advice be
to somebody who's really

00:05:10.834 --> 00:05:12.160
looking to find that dream job?

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.710
What is it that they could do to
make themselves more appealing

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.258
or to find that right match?

00:05:19.602 --> 00:05:21.310
CODY VOELLINGER: That's
a tough question.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.290
I don't know that
there's anything

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.660
you have to do to make
yourself "more appealing,"

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:30.430
quote, unquote.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.370
I mean, if you haven't
interviewed in a long time,

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.560
then I would recommend doing
some practice mock interviews

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.960
just to get comfortable.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.320
Or start out your interviewing
with a couple companies

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.730
you're not as interested in
almost as a practice round.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.860
But you're not trying
to trick someone.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.340
To go back to the dating
and marriage analogy,

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.890
you want to be yourself.

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.990
And you want to find
a company that's

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.820
also going to be upfront
with you about what

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.480
their expectations are so
that you can stay there

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.770
for the long term.

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.580
So of course this
is self serving.

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.320
But honestly, if I were
going to look for a job,

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.070
I would look for a
well-connected recruiter

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.392
because, as I mentioned,
we've worked with hundreds

00:06:16.392 --> 00:06:17.350
of different companies.

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.040
We've been to all
of those offices.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.700
We've sat down
with the founders.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:26.960
A single job searcher doesn't
have the time to do that.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:32.160
And so let someone else be
a first round filter for you

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.230
and then suggest likely
connections based

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.570
on your interests.

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.050
And finding a recruiter
that you can trust

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:42.930
and you can partner
with is difficult.

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.370
And so I recommend you
talk to your friends,

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:47.440
talk to your network.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.380
Ask who they've had
good experiences with.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.739
And value those
recommendations really highly.

00:06:53.739 --> 00:06:54.530
KORY JEFFREY: Cool.

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.080
So Founder World.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.570
What excites you
about coming here?

00:06:58.570 --> 00:06:59.528
Why are you here today?

00:06:59.528 --> 00:07:00.410
Why did you speak?

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:00.730
CODY VOELLINGER: Jermaine Dupri.

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:02.190
I'm sitting in his seat, man.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:03.731
KORY JEFFREY: It's
still warm, right?

00:07:03.731 --> 00:07:06.620
CODY VOELLINGER: It's still
warm from Jermaine Dupri.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.820
I love Guy Kawasaki.

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.090
I've seen him speak
a couple times.

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:15.295
Tim Draper has some
insane, out there ideas

00:07:15.295 --> 00:07:19.780
that he's actually
implementing, like slicing up

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:24.470
California and Draper
University and everything.

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:29.200
So there's just a lot of
great ideas and minds.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.200
And then, for those of
you who can't be here,

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.520
there's so much energy
buzzing around this place

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.280
and excitement over people
starting new companies.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.120
And that's fun for
us because we get

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:45.320
to just take that all in, bottle
it up, and take that passion

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.980
into our jobs of helping these
people build their companies

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.480
and helping people find
jobs that they're going

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.640
to be really passionate about.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.480
So we talk to so
many engineers who

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.830
are tired of being
a cog in a machine,

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.610
not feeling like
they have an impact.

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:04.930
And so to help those
folks find something

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:07.020
that they're going
to love to wake up

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:11.870
and come into work early and
really put their heart into,

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:13.030
that's exciting for us.

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:14.780
And that's what kind
of keeps us motivated

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.940
and keeps us going
as recruiters.

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:18.440
KORY JEFFREY: So
obviously, you guys

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.606
are very involved in the
Bay Area, I believe, right?

00:08:20.606 --> 00:08:23.110
You said in the Valley.

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:24.940
What is the number
one position that's

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:28.230
most sought after that you
see from startups today?

00:08:31.486 --> 00:08:33.860
CODY VOELLINGER: We have a
giant whiteboard in our office

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.970
that lists all of the positions
and all of the companies

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:39.250
that we're recruiting for.

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:43.000
The one that's probably the
longest list at the moment--

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.020
and it fluctuates.

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:45.250
It ebbs and flows.

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.310
The one that's the longest
right now is probably

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:49.900
front end engineers.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:54.920
And I would say that's because
every company needs a front end

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.520
engineer.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.210
So while someone
might be working

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:04.160
with Scala or Go or
Node.js on the back end,

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:09.540
they all need JavaScript
engineers on the front end.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.344
That's probably the most
in demand at the moment.

00:09:12.344 --> 00:09:14.010
KORY JEFFREY: And
then I'll end it with,

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:17.512
what is your favorite
Google technology?

00:09:17.512 --> 00:09:18.720
CODY VOELLINGER: Google Maps.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:19.210
KORY JEFFREY: Google Maps.

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:21.810
CODY VOELLINGER: Google Maps,
because I would literally

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:23.710
be lost without it.

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:25.710
KORY JEFFREY: I could
agree with that, actually.

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:27.460
That's a great answer.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:29.230
Cody, thank you very
much for joining us.

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:29.600
CODY VOELLINGER: Thank you.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.050
KORY JEFFREY: Awesome.

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:30.325
CODY VOELLINGER: Appreciate it.

00:09:30.325 --> 00:09:31.780
KORY JEFFREY: And thank
you guys for joining us.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.405
This is at Founder World in San
Francisco, and my name is Kory.
