00:00:14.286 --> 00:00:15.809
In 1994,

00:00:15.833 --> 00:00:20.047
Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein
coauthored "The Bell Curve,"

00:00:20.071 --> 00:00:22.172
an extremely controversial book

00:00:22.196 --> 00:00:24.117
which claims that on average,

00:00:24.141 --> 00:00:27.624
some races are smarter
and more likely to succeed than others.

00:00:28.117 --> 00:00:30.807
Murray and Herrnstein also suggest

00:00:30.831 --> 00:00:35.423
that a lack of critical intelligence
explains the prominence of violent crime

00:00:35.447 --> 00:00:37.894
in poor African-American communities.

00:00:39.575 --> 00:00:43.587
But Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein
are not the only people who think this.

00:00:43.611 --> 00:00:45.138
In 2012,

00:00:45.162 --> 00:00:49.714
a writer, journalist and political
commentator named John Derbyshire

00:00:49.738 --> 00:00:54.077
wrote an article that was supposed to be
a non-black version of the talk

00:00:54.101 --> 00:00:57.379
that many black parents feel
they have to give their kids today:

00:00:57.403 --> 00:00:59.423
advice on how to stay safe.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.752
In it, he offered suggestions such as:

00:01:03.776 --> 00:01:06.983
"Do not attend events
likely to draw a lot of blacks,"

00:01:07.007 --> 00:01:09.277
"Stay out of heavily black neighborhoods"

00:01:09.847 --> 00:01:12.975
and "Do not act the Good Samaritan
to blacks in distress."

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.195
And yet, in 2016,
I invited John Derbyshire

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:19.895
as well as Charles Murray

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:21.385
to speak at my school,

00:01:21.895 --> 00:01:26.315
knowing full well that I would
be giving them a platform and attention

00:01:26.339 --> 00:01:29.195
for ideas that I despised and rejected.

00:01:30.315 --> 00:01:33.307
But this is just a further evolution

00:01:33.331 --> 00:01:36.242
of a journey of uncomfortable learning
throughout my life.

00:01:37.192 --> 00:01:41.311
When I was 10 years old, my mother
was diagnosed with schizophrenia,

00:01:42.403 --> 00:01:46.563
a mental illness characterized
by mood swings and paranoid delusions.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.537
Throughout my life, my mother's rage
would turn our small house

00:01:51.561 --> 00:01:52.761
into a minefield.

00:01:54.366 --> 00:01:57.578
Yet, though I feared
her rage on a daily basis,

00:01:57.602 --> 00:01:59.794
I also learned so much from her.

00:02:00.848 --> 00:02:04.859
Our relationship was complicated
and challenging,

00:02:05.816 --> 00:02:10.492
and at the age of 14, it was decided
that I needed to live apart from her.

00:02:12.175 --> 00:02:13.822
But over the years,

00:02:13.846 --> 00:02:16.333
I've come to appreciate
some of the important lessons

00:02:16.357 --> 00:02:17.863
my mother taught me about life.

00:02:18.823 --> 00:02:22.925
She was the first person who spoke to me
about learning from the other side.

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:27.189
And she, like me, was born and raised

00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:29.736
in a family of committed
liberal democrats.

00:02:30.673 --> 00:02:34.886
Yet, she encouraged me to see the world
and the issues our world faces

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.891
as complex, controversial
and ever-changing.

00:02:40.307 --> 00:02:42.871
One day, I came across
the phrase "affirmative action"

00:02:42.895 --> 00:02:44.206
in a book I was reading.

00:02:45.377 --> 00:02:48.004
And when I asked her what the term meant,

00:02:48.028 --> 00:02:50.147
she spent what felt like an hour

00:02:50.171 --> 00:02:52.369
giving me a thorough
and thoughtful explanation

00:02:52.393 --> 00:02:54.297
that would make sense to a small child.

00:02:54.792 --> 00:02:58.364
She even made the topic sound
at least as interesting

00:02:58.388 --> 00:03:00.035
as any of my professors have.

00:03:01.165 --> 00:03:05.172
She explained the many reasons
why people of various political views

00:03:05.196 --> 00:03:07.378
challenge and support affirmative action,

00:03:07.823 --> 00:03:11.688
stressing that, while she strongly
supported it herself,

00:03:11.712 --> 00:03:15.123
it was important for me to view the issue
as a controversial one

00:03:15.553 --> 00:03:16.886
with a long history,

00:03:17.641 --> 00:03:19.315
a questionable future

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:21.569
and a host of complicating factors.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.083
While affirmative action can increase
the presence of minorities

00:03:26.107 --> 00:03:28.688
at elite educational institutions,

00:03:28.712 --> 00:03:33.190
she felt that it could also disadvantage
hardworking people of different races

00:03:33.214 --> 00:03:35.166
from more affluent backgrounds.

00:03:37.411 --> 00:03:39.809
My mom wanted me to understand

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:43.698
that I should never
just write off opinions

00:03:43.722 --> 00:03:46.355
that I disagreed with or disliked,

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:50.189
because there was always something
to learn from the perspectives of others,

00:03:50.902 --> 00:03:53.100
even when doing so might be difficult.

00:03:53.887 --> 00:03:56.123
But life at home with my mom

00:03:56.712 --> 00:04:01.294
was not the only aspect of my journey
that has been formative and uncomfortable.

00:04:01.776 --> 00:04:05.268
In fourth grade, she decided
that I should attend a private school

00:04:05.292 --> 00:04:08.006
in order to receive
the best education possible.

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:12.149
As a black student attending
predominantly white private schools,

00:04:12.173 --> 00:04:16.109
I've encountered attitudes and behaviors
that reflected racial stereotypes.

00:04:17.157 --> 00:04:21.521
Several of my friends' parents
assumed within minutes of meeting me

00:04:21.545 --> 00:04:24.345
that my best skill was playing basketball.

00:04:25.244 --> 00:04:28.536
And it really upset me to think
that my race made it harder for them

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.391
to see me as a student who loved
reading, writing and speaking.

00:04:32.998 --> 00:04:37.077
Experiences like this motivated me
to work tirelessly

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:41.465
to disprove what I knew
people had assumed.

00:04:42.967 --> 00:04:46.490
My mother even said that,
in order to put my best foot forward,

00:04:46.514 --> 00:04:50.029
I had to be patient, alert
and excruciatingly well-mannered.

00:04:50.053 --> 00:04:54.299
To prove that I belonged,
I had to show poise and confidence,

00:04:54.323 --> 00:04:56.998
the ability to speak well
and listen closely.

00:04:57.022 --> 00:05:00.099
Only then would my peers see
that I deserved to be there

00:05:00.123 --> 00:05:01.456
as much as they did.

00:05:02.165 --> 00:05:06.264
Despite this racial stereotyping
and the discomfort I often felt,

00:05:07.387 --> 00:05:11.578
the learning I gained from other aspects
of being at an elite private school

00:05:11.602 --> 00:05:12.996
were incredibly valuable.

00:05:14.181 --> 00:05:18.593
I was encouraged by my teachers
to explore my curiosity,

00:05:18.617 --> 00:05:20.799
to challenge myself in new ways

00:05:20.823 --> 00:05:25.029
and to deepen my understanding
of subjects that fascinated me the most.

00:05:26.498 --> 00:05:29.098
And going to college was the next step.

00:05:30.037 --> 00:05:33.737
I was excited to take my intellectual
drive and interest in the world of ideas

00:05:33.761 --> 00:05:34.990
to the next level.

00:05:35.014 --> 00:05:40.613
I was eager to engage in lively debate
with peers and professors

00:05:40.637 --> 00:05:42.418
and with outside speakers;

00:05:42.442 --> 00:05:46.450
to listen, to learn and gain
a deeper understanding of myself

00:05:46.474 --> 00:05:47.624
and of others.

00:05:48.371 --> 00:05:51.737
While I was fortunate to meet
peers and professors

00:05:51.761 --> 00:05:54.307
who were interested
in doing the same thing,

00:05:54.331 --> 00:05:58.992
my desire to engage with difficult ideas
was also met with resistance.

00:06:00.641 --> 00:06:05.331
To prepare myself to engage
with controversy in the real world,

00:06:05.355 --> 00:06:08.696
I joined a group that brought
controversial speakers to campus.

00:06:09.157 --> 00:06:11.632
But many people fiercely
opposed this group,

00:06:12.093 --> 00:06:14.585
and I received significant pushback

00:06:14.609 --> 00:06:17.676
from students, faculty
and my administration.

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:22.982
For many, it was difficult to see

00:06:23.006 --> 00:06:26.743
how bringing controversial
speakers to campus could be valuable,

00:06:26.767 --> 00:06:28.224
when they caused harm.

00:06:28.823 --> 00:06:32.028
And it was disappointing to me
facing personal attacks,

00:06:32.052 --> 00:06:34.679
having my administration cancel speakers

00:06:34.703 --> 00:06:38.111
and hearing my intentions
distorted by those around me.

00:06:39.642 --> 00:06:42.512
My work also hurt the feelings of many,

00:06:42.536 --> 00:06:43.733
and I understood that.

00:06:45.058 --> 00:06:47.740
Of course, no one likes being offended,

00:06:47.764 --> 00:06:50.914
and I certainly don't like hearing
controversial speakers

00:06:50.938 --> 00:06:54.321
argue that feminism has become
a war against men

00:06:54.345 --> 00:06:56.727
or that blacks have lower IQs than whites.

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:59.177
I also understand

00:06:59.201 --> 00:07:04.107
that some people have experienced
traumatic experiences in their lives.

00:07:05.688 --> 00:07:08.759
And for some, listening to offensive views

00:07:08.783 --> 00:07:12.984
can be like reliving the very traumas
that they've worked so hard to overcome.

00:07:13.704 --> 00:07:16.347
Many argue that by giving
these people a platform,

00:07:16.371 --> 00:07:18.307
you're doing more harm than good,

00:07:18.331 --> 00:07:22.617
and I'm reminded of this every time
I listen to these points of view

00:07:22.641 --> 00:07:24.307
and feel my stomach turn.

00:07:25.235 --> 00:07:28.183
Yet, tuning out opposing viewpoints
doesn't make them go away,

00:07:28.207 --> 00:07:30.225
because millions of people
agree with them.

00:07:31.179 --> 00:07:33.806
In order to understand
the potential of society

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:35.245
to progress forward,

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:38.148
we need to understand the counterforces.

00:07:39.244 --> 00:07:43.220
By engaging with controversial
and offensive ideas,

00:07:43.244 --> 00:07:45.593
I believe that we can find common ground,

00:07:46.403 --> 00:07:49.339
if not with the speakers themselves,

00:07:49.363 --> 00:07:52.296
then with the audiences
they may attract or indoctrinate.

00:07:53.268 --> 00:07:58.506
Through engaging, I believe
that we may reach a better understanding,

00:07:58.530 --> 00:07:59.998
a deeper understanding,

00:08:00.022 --> 00:08:01.673
of our own beliefs

00:08:01.697 --> 00:08:04.395
and preserve the ability
to solve problems,

00:08:05.514 --> 00:08:08.085
which we can't do
if we don't talk to each other

00:08:08.109 --> 00:08:10.776
and make an effort to be good listeners.

00:08:12.275 --> 00:08:13.715
But soon after I announced

00:08:13.739 --> 00:08:16.537
that John Derbyshire
would be speaking on campus,

00:08:16.561 --> 00:08:19.537
student backlash erupted on social media.

00:08:19.561 --> 00:08:22.236
The tide of resistance,
in fact, was so intense,

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.998
that my college president
rescinded the invitation.

00:08:25.561 --> 00:08:28.696
I was deeply disappointed by this
because, as I saw it,

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:32.482
there would be nothing
that any of my peers or I could do

00:08:32.506 --> 00:08:34.585
to silence someone who agreed with him

00:08:34.609 --> 00:08:37.267
in the office environment
of our future employers.

00:08:38.292 --> 00:08:41.130
I look out at what's happening
on college campuses,

00:08:41.154 --> 00:08:42.321
and I see the anger.

00:08:42.815 --> 00:08:43.965
And I get it.

00:08:44.363 --> 00:08:48.305
But what I wish I could tell people
is that it's worth the discomfort,

00:08:48.329 --> 00:08:49.592
it's worth listening,

00:08:49.616 --> 00:08:53.148
and that we're stronger,
not weaker, because of it.

00:08:54.395 --> 00:08:57.654
When I think about my experiences
with uncomfortable learning,

00:08:59.403 --> 00:09:00.971
and I reflect upon them,

00:09:02.035 --> 00:09:06.002
I've found that it's been very difficult
to change the values

00:09:06.026 --> 00:09:08.773
of the intellectual community
that I've been a part of.

00:09:10.585 --> 00:09:11.976
But I do feel a sense of hope

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.726
when I think about the individual
interactions that I've been able to have

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:18.910
with students who both support
the work that I'm doing

00:09:18.934 --> 00:09:22.059
and who feel challenged by it
and who do not support it.

00:09:23.447 --> 00:09:24.610
What I've found is that,

00:09:24.634 --> 00:09:27.545
while it can be difficult to change
the values of a community,

00:09:27.569 --> 00:09:30.632
we can gain a lot
from individual interactions.

00:09:31.419 --> 00:09:34.727
While I didn't get to engage
with John Derbyshire

00:09:34.751 --> 00:09:36.848
due to my president's disinvitation,

00:09:36.872 --> 00:09:40.948
I was able to have dinner
with Charles Murray before his talk.

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.171
I knew the conversation
would be difficult.

00:09:44.879 --> 00:09:47.045
And I didn't expect it to be pleasant.

00:09:47.069 --> 00:09:51.361
But it was cordial, and I did gain
a deeper understanding of his arguments.

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:57.390
I found that he, like me,
believed in creating a more just society.

00:09:58.224 --> 00:10:02.192
The thing is, his understanding
of what justice entailed

00:10:02.216 --> 00:10:03.820
was very different from my own.

00:10:04.879 --> 00:10:07.549
The way in which he wanted
to understand the issue,

00:10:07.573 --> 00:10:10.503
the way in which he wanted
to approach the issue of inequality

00:10:10.527 --> 00:10:12.260
also differed from my own.

00:10:12.749 --> 00:10:15.825
And I found that his understanding
of issues like welfare

00:10:15.849 --> 00:10:17.043
and affirmative action

00:10:17.067 --> 00:10:19.188
was tied and deeply rooted

00:10:19.212 --> 00:10:23.299
in his understanding of various
libertarian and conservative beliefs,

00:10:23.323 --> 00:10:26.879
what diminishes and increases
their presence in our society.

00:10:27.535 --> 00:10:30.582
While he expressed
his viewpoints eloquently,

00:10:30.606 --> 00:10:32.485
I remained thoroughly unconvinced.

00:10:32.923 --> 00:10:35.910
But I did walk away
with a deeper understanding.

00:10:36.796 --> 00:10:38.262
It's my belief

00:10:39.134 --> 00:10:41.921
that to achieve progress
in the face of adversity,

00:10:43.585 --> 00:10:46.291
we need a genuine commitment

00:10:46.315 --> 00:10:48.751
to gaining a deeper
understanding of humanity.

00:10:50.077 --> 00:10:52.230
I'd like to see a world with more leaders

00:10:52.254 --> 00:10:54.390
who are familiar with
the depths of the views

00:10:54.414 --> 00:10:57.282
of those they deeply disagree with,

00:10:58.998 --> 00:11:02.641
so that they can understand the nuances
of everyone they're representing.

00:11:03.022 --> 00:11:07.367
I see this as an ongoing process
involving constant learning,

00:11:07.391 --> 00:11:11.077
and I'm confident that I'll be able
to add value down the line

00:11:11.101 --> 00:11:13.869
if I continue building empathy
and understanding

00:11:13.893 --> 00:11:16.523
through engaging
with unfamiliar perspectives.

00:11:16.547 --> 00:11:17.704
Thank you.

00:11:17.728 --> 00:11:21.018
(Applause)
