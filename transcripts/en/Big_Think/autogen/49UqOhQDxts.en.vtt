it happens and most likely you are

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790
it happens and most likely you are
 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.019
it happens and most likely you are
storing things in the brain and you're

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029
storing things in the brain and you're
 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.780
storing things in the brain and you're
confusing for me your fantasy with the

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:20.790
confusing for me your fantasy with the
 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:27.980
confusing for me your fantasy with the
reality and were you one possibility the

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990
reality and were you one possibility the
 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.480
reality and were you one possibility the
other possibility like he had the wrong

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490
other possibility like he had the wrong
 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.470

perception of what you saw so you store

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480
perception of what you saw so you store
 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.670
perception of what you saw so you store
in a certain way because you're

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680
in a certain way because you're
 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.000
in a certain way because you're
convinced that that it's that way but it

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010
convinced that that it's that way but it
 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.480
convinced that that it's that way but it
was not that way if let's say

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:46.490
 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.340
a stupid example I mean you're convinced

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350
a stupid example I mean you're convinced
 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.890
a stupid example I mean you're convinced
that maybe were not did not pay that

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900
that maybe were not did not pay that
 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.200
that maybe were not did not pay that
much attention and you convince the

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210
much attention and you convince the
 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.970
much attention and you convince the
person was dressed in red instead it was

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980
person was dressed in red instead it was
 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.840
person was dressed in red instead it was
pink or a color close to read then then

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850
pink or a color close to read then then
 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.240
pink or a color close to read then then
you you store the thing in that that way

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250
you you store the thing in that that way
 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.670
you you store the thing in that that way
obviously with time and the memory will

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680
obviously with time and the memory will
 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.080
obviously with time and the memory will
become more far away certain aspect

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090
become more far away certain aspect
 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.980
become more far away certain aspect
could disappear and we could fill them

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990
could disappear and we could fill them
 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.469
could disappear and we could fill them
with other aspect just to fill the gap

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479
with other aspect just to fill the gap
 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.350
with other aspect just to fill the gap
so we make up for the memory and we

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360
so we make up for the memory and we
 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.000
so we make up for the memory and we
build up the memory and the time of

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010
build up the memory and the time of
 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.410
build up the memory and the time of
recalling the memory we are recalling

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420
recalling the memory we are recalling
 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.719
recalling the memory we are recalling
stuff that occurred in other

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729
stuff that occurred in other
 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.520
stuff that occurred in other
circumstances because I mean it's a

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530
circumstances because I mean it's a
 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.370
circumstances because I mean it's a
memory it's not our brain is not there a

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380
memory it's not our brain is not there a
 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.820
memory it's not our brain is not there a
recorder like passive recorder it's a

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830
recorder like passive recorder it's a
 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.520
recorder like passive recorder it's a
more active process so being an active

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530
more active process so being an active
 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.190
more active process so being an active
process there are could be ways of you

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200
process there are could be ways of you
 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.859
process there are could be ways of you
know changing it because actively we can

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869
know changing it because actively we can
 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.070
know changing it because actively we can
we can change it so that's something

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080
we can change it so that's something
 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.749
we can change it so that's something
which is important it's not that word

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759
which is important it's not that word
 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.350
which is important it's not that word
brain is like a tape recorder or a TV or

vcr I mean it's not the lattice it was

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240
vcr I mean it's not the lattice it was
 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.900
vcr I mean it's not the lattice it was
more active than that and there are

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910
more active than that and there are
 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.029
more active than that and there are
several steps in the process of memory

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039
several steps in the process of memory
 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.219
several steps in the process of memory
and recalling a memory which there are

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229
and recalling a memory which there are
 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.070
and recalling a memory which there are
many many steps several steps and each

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080
many many steps several steps and each
 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.290
many many steps several steps and each
one of them as memory could be labelled

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300
one of them as memory could be labelled
 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.480
one of them as memory could be labelled
and could be you know changed doing for

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490
and could be you know changed doing for
 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.360
and could be you know changed doing for
something else which you do by something

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370
something else which you do by something

you change something from analog to

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470
you change something from analog to
 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.030
you change something from analog to
digital just to make one of those things

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040
digital just to make one of those things
 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.130

that process of changing from analog to
 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.880
that process of changing from analog to
digital you can change something and

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890
digital you can change something and
 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.420
digital you can change something and
will not be the same you know what if

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430
will not be the same you know what if
 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.140
will not be the same you know what if
you change the cheap or something and

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150
you change the cheap or something and
 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.110
you change the cheap or something and
you change the yellow into a green so

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120
you change the yellow into a green so
 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.920
you change the yellow into a green so
what there was yellow will be green and

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930
what there was yellow will be green and
 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.569
what there was yellow will be green and
or a when I say nay you can even have to

fish alee change it to into a B if you

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200
fish alee change it to into a B if you
 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.870
fish alee change it to into a B if you
want because if you tell the computer to

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880
want because if you tell the computer to
 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.430
want because if you tell the computer to
change all the a into a beat and

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440
change all the a into a beat and
 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.160
change all the a into a beat and
everything would be a baby or sometimes

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170
everything would be a baby or sometimes
 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.870
everything would be a baby or sometimes
you this process some may will changing

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880
you this process some may will changing
