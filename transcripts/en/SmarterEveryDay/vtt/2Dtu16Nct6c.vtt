00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.040
Surprised your had it running at full speed. Hey it's me Destin welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.070
This is Mark Rober.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.080
Mark is using me.. Is this true or false?
- [laugh]

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.100
- Mark is using me to access you subscribers. I'm not really happy about this Mark.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.160
- That is a false statement.
- That's exactly what's happening.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.220
[music]

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.250
Alright. So in the field of engineering, people always celebrate these

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.260
awesome great achievements but they never really think about all the failures that it took to get to that point.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.300
Well this video's different. In this video I'm gonna show you the failures that we experienced

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.320
when we're trying to make a bullet time rig using a phantom high speed camera.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.350
OK so I brought a high speed camera out here. Mark did this GoPro rig with an armature

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.380
and he could see around things. It's kind of like simulated bullet time

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.410
only with movement, so we're gonna try the same thing with high speed with this rig

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.430
that they've built. And have you ever had it up to full speed?
- No it's too dangerous. [laugh]

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.450
- This is dumb. We're in the middle of the desert.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.470
We're doing high speed in the dark? Whose idea was this? [laugh] So we've got a mirror apparatus.

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:08.510
- That's right. So basically the way it works is, this whole thing is fixed.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.530
What we did is basically attach it to a DC motor. Watch the camera lens.
- Got it.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.570
- And then you have a, you plant the camera down here so it's stationary and then the light

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.620
goes from here out to here and then it bounces up here.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.650
So up here you'll have like a watermelon.
- Gotcha.
- If you're gonna explode it, and because this is

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.700
spinning around so fast, it's effectively like the camera's out here

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.710
itself, but this is just a more safe way to do it.
- So 80/20 is a type of

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.720
extruded aluminum that engineers geek out with a lot, and so basically

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.760
you get this cross section and then you can use bolts and stuff like that. Ken would you like to talk

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.800
about your creation?
- If it's out of balance in any way, shape or form, if

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.840
the centre of gravity doesn't line right on this axis of the motor,

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.890
of the spin, the whole thing is gonna wobble and orbit and

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.950
essentially we could generate enough forces that the whole thing would either catastrophically

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.970
fall apart, or we could have parts fling off at us

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.980
and it could be quite dangerous. So that's why you've got it strapped off here right?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.020
Thanks Ken, running out of light. Let's do it. [laugh]

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.060
Got a tripod head. So this is the camera

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.120
tripod mount. This is Ken's, but we have to put it down

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.130
below the mirror, get our distance right so that we don't have

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.180
mechanical interference.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.210
- And we've got a propane balloon.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.260
(Desin) OK and how're you gonna light it?
- So we have a neon transformer here,

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.270
and when we set it off, we're gonna see a spark jump across this gap

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.310
and I placed a match head in between that so that the

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.340
propane itself will ignite.
- Aren't you clever. Oh this is a cool shot. So in the background there

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.370
is NASA's Jet Propulsion Labratory.
(Destin) Not as cool as what we're doing in this

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.410
sketchy little river bed.
- And 3.. 2..

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.420
1.. fire. [pop] Oh no. [laugh]

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.450
(Destin) My thought is, when it's going boom, all that propane is pushing down,

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.480
and there's no oxygen mixing with it, and it's just blowing away.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.520
- I believe that.
- Why do you have your glasses on?
(Destin) Safety. [laugh]

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.560
- 3.. 2.. 1.. [pop]

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.570
[laughs] Yess!

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.610
- Science!

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.700
[cheering]

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.850
(Destin) OK now we're going to do what?
- Alright now we're gonna speed test

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.890
the system... Speeding up.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.920
- OK Pull it out, it's struggling.
(Destin) Oh come on man, look at that.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.940
[laugh]
(Destin) Art.
- Fine.
- We're on.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.970
- You see that mode

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.020
it's that plate that bends.
(Destin) Alright, alright, alrighhhht
- Stop-stop-stop-stop! Ohhh.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.100
- I think we're...
(Destin) Was it rolling?
- I don't know if I was.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.140
[moan]
(Destin) Look at camera, look at camera. What are you thinking right now Mark?

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.160
- It's recoverable. Arrrgh, you learn from your

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.180
errors. I want to kill you. [laugh]

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.200
So basically the centre of mass on this mirror isn't lined up with the axis of

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.210
where we have the bolts, so it's sort of a weak, so essentially..
(Destin) It's just a friction

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.250
- It's a friction joint here, so there's an offset sort of a moment, that was

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.310
causing this to come out.
(Destin) So basically the centre of mass of this

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.330
mirror is a few inches below the hinge point.
- The hinge point, right.
- And so that

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.340
creates a moment about that friction joint, and then once you get to that

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.350
certain rotational velocity then..
- It was just too much. It overcame that friction

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.390
and then we contacted right here.
- Alright let's run through our failures. Number one.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.420
It was too dark because my plane came in late. Number two the balloon

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.440
couldn't pop the way we wanted it to so we had to use a torch. Number three we didn't line the camera up

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.480
right with the armature. Number four if you use a mirror you'll lose about

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.530
30% of the light by the time it reflects off the surface. The solution for this is to use

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.560
what's called a front surface mirror which basically has the reflective surface on the outside

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.580
That way the light doesn't have to go through the glass to get to the reflective surface. Number five

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.610
of course is the mirror slipped and banged against the armature. The fix for this was to put a mechanical

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.630
hard stop in position. And finally fire's really not that interesting in this setup.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.670
If you think about it, you've got this big flame that's kind of nebulous and there's no real point you can

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.730
focus on. Even though we had all these failures this is part of the design process.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.770
Once we worked through all these failures we were able to come up with this.

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.790
[music]

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:18.910
OK if you want to see more of this Matrix footage because it's amazing then go check out Mark Rober's channel.

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.940
I subscribed to him a long time ago. He earned my subscription with the Mars rover video, and also

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.980
his road kill video and if you give him a shot I bet he'll earn yours too.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.020
Anyway I'll leave a link over here on the side. If you want to check him out, give him a shot.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.040
OK this video was all about failure, which is why for today's sponsorship on Smarter Every Day

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.050
I'm gonna recommend the book Failure is not an Option by Gene Kranz. If you don't know who this guy is,

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:43.100
he's pretty awesome. He was in mission control from the apollo program

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.130
even before that, Gemini even. He was there for Apollo 13. Anyway, human lives were on the line

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:51.160
they stared failure in the face and they beat it. It's pretty awesome. So you can listen to this if you go to

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:55.210
audible.com/smarter, download this book, it's pretty awesome. I'll leave a link

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:59.240
