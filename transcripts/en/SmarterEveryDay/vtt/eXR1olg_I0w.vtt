00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.500
Hey it's me Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.000
If there is one thing that I learnt from the backwards bicycle experiment

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.640
Is that knowledge is not understanding

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.300
So a couple of years ago when I made the YouTube series about helicopter physics

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.380
I gained the knowledge of how they worked, but not really the understanding

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.000
so today on Smarter Every Day
I'm going to try hover a helicopter

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I've heard its the hardest thing you can do, specifically the Robinson 22

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.240
because it's a pure helicopter, there is no augmentation

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.900
So today on Smarter Every Day, we're going to learn what goes into doing that

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.900
and what her brain is doing

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.900
It's really quite incredible

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.280
Let's go get Smarter Every Day

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.480
I'm going to be straight up with you

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.500
I'm convinced that helicopter instructor pilots are either complete idiots, or incredibly brave

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.740
I mean think about it

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.100
They get into a helicopter with someone they've never met

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.080
and give them the controls

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.920
(Destin) This is my first rotary -
(Brandon) crash course

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.620
No! I don't want to take a crash course

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.540
Notice that the controls are actually connected together

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.580
which means if I do something stupid

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.100
Brandon has to wrestle the controls out of my hand

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.160
Or just trust that I'm going to let go

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.040
That's crazy

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.580
Anyway, watch how bad I fly every single  time he gives me the controls -

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.300
- and you can easily tell when he takes back over

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.540
(Brandon) Almost got it, there you go
Pedal to your heading

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:14.780
(Brandon) laughs 
(Destin) crap

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.020
(Destin) So I'm going to try that, we're going to taxi down
(Brandon)Yep

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.100
(Brandon) So you have the controls
(Destin) I have the controls

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.060
(Destin) okay you got it - laughs

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.580
(Brandon) Alright so you have the cyclic, alright just try to hold this in this spot

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.000
(Destin) Alright
(Brandon) Alright lets get us back over to that left...

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.000
(Destin) Good grief man

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.460
(Destin) Alright you're going to have to take over

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.780
(Destin) You got it?
(Brandon) Yep I got it

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.700
(Brandon) A little forward

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.980
(Destin) My bad

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.040
(Destin) Jeez...Whoop, let's don't hit that sign I say

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.120
(ATC Chatter) Destin and Brandon laugh

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.280
(Destin) Yep you have the craziest job in the world

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.940
(Brandon) Yep, it has it's ups and downs

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.180
(Brandon) Most...(laughs)...that's an awful joke

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.780
(Destin) So there is a moment when it clicks?
(Brandon) Yeah

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.600
(Destin) How long does it normally take?
(Brandon) 6 - 8 hours

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.860
Destin laughs
(Destin) How long is it going to take me?

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.300
(Brandon) 6 - 8 months
Destin and Brandon laugh

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.240
My next instructor was Tommy
We went in the R44 because the R22 was down for maintenance

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.400
I started to watch how they teach

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.320
And I noticed if I was starting to do something stupid their hands would get closer to the controls

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.540
- and when I was doing something easy, like flying straight and level, then they get more relaxed

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.980
Anyway, instructors call this part, when we're learning how to hover, the 'rodeo'

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.400
One of the best things that Tommy did for me was to teach me how to chill out

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.860
The thing I was doing was called a:

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.080
I was basically freaking out and over controlling, which made the whole aircraft wobble

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.780
Once I chilled, I was able to stabilise

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.420
Tommy got this to click in my brain by first teaching me how delicately to operate the controls

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.560
- and then showing me how two controls interact with each other

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.440
(Tommy) If you've moved the control, you've moved too much

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.660
(Destin) If you've moved the control...
(Tommy) Do you see what I'm saying though?
(Destin) Yeah

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.500
(Tommy) It's that whole thought process of it all

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.140
(Tommy) Alright, using the left pedal and only left pedal again, point me at that tree over there

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.520
(Destin) It's like...not even...a thought

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.980
(Tommy)Right! There you go, so something just clicked in your brain I can tell
(Destin) Okay

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.500
(Destin) Okay, I have collective, I have pedals, I'm going to try point at the stop sign -

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.080
- I'm going to raise and I'm going to keep pointing at the stop sign
(Tommy) Oh yeah, look something else just clicked

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.580
(Destin) So why do you have to move multiple controls to do one simple maneuver?

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.180
Turns out, THIS is the secret of hovering a helicopter

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.840
Okay, you've seen Rubik's cube solvers right? These guys that like have it stored somewhere in their brain stem

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.240
- and they can look at it and just instantly understand what they need to do right, to solve the thing

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.460
Well that's exactly what helicopter pilots are doing because if you think about it

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.960
- every time you change something, on a Rubik's cube, multiple inputs are changing all over the thing

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.380
It's a whole system, that's the way helicopters work

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:21.140
You have to come up with the most efficient and effective solution instantly to arrive at that perfect solution right of the bat

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.100
That's something you have to get in muscle memory somehow

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.500
Okay there are three main controls for a helicopter
The first one is what we call: collective

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.040
Collective is your power that you are applying to the rotor system

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:42.220
Basically the swash-plate moves together and it rotates those rotor blades so that they're taking more or less of a bite out of the air

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:47.880
Now if you think about that, when you do that it applies more torque or less torque to the body of the helicopter right

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.220
So you have to counter-act that with the pedals

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:57.220
When she moves the pedals back and forth, that, of course, gives you more or less counter-torque on the body of the whole aircraft

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:05.200
Another thing that you need to think about is that tail-rotor is blowing air, so it's pushing the whole helicopter to the side, right

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.560
- so the way you counteract that is what? Cyclic

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:15.780
Cyclic is similar to collective in that it moves the rotors in the swash-plate, only it does it independently

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:22.420
You can see that it is changing the swash-plate so that the rotors are moving independently of each other

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.380
What she has to do, is she has to take all three of these inputs, make them work together

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:33.460
Now imagine that happening several times a second, and you have kind of an idea of what's going on in Michelle's brain. Right?

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.720
(Destin) No?
(Michelle) This takes way more brain power
(Destin laughs)

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.820
Alright the next flight is with Michelle, who happens to be really sassy

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.880
When we got into the R22, she says "just so you know I'm a little bit more hands off"

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.160
Which basically meant if I got into a pilot induced oscillation she was going to make me recover

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.520
(Destin) Am I doing this or are you doing this?...Okay, thank you
(Michelle laughs)

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.880
I kind of didn't believe her though until she let me take off this horribly

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:05.280
(Destin)Golly
(Michelle laughing) That's one way to do it
(Destin laughing) You're awful

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.720
(Destin) So you ARE hands off
(Michelle) And we're off
(Destin laughs)

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.780
She basically forced me to straighten up by taking away my safety net, but I had gotten better really fast

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.860
(Michelle) I thought you said you sucked at this?
(Destin) Ah, I do suck at this
(Michelle) Eh, looks good to me

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.300
(Michelle) Alright you have the control
(Destin) So, first I'm going to take off, so that's the first thing you have to do?

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.840
(Destin) I'm teaching you how to do this now right
(Michelle laughs) I appreciate that

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:28.900
(Michelle) Perfect, there you go

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.200
(Destin) Alright...so there we are...we're hovering

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.240
(Michelle) We are hovering
(Destin) Poorly, but we are hovering
(Michelle) It's happening

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.220
(Destin) I want to try land over there
(Michelle) Okay

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:38.900
(Destin) And act like I know what I'm doing, even though I dont

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.380
(Michelle) I believe in you
(Destin) Okay, here we go

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.980
(Destin) I'm looking outside, looking outside, looking outside, looking outside

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:48.580
- I'm starting to commit, starting to commit, starting to commit, and we're down

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:51.300
(Destin) AH

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.220
(Michelle) I appreciate you teaching me that
(Destin laughs)

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.760
(Destin) Oh okay, I want to hold this...BOOM

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000
(Michelle) Very nicely done

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.720
Okay so Brandon was crazy enough to start with me, and I decided to end with him so I could assess my progess

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:10.580
By this point I could take off, navigate to where-ever he wanted me, shoot an approach and even land

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:14.120
But remember, my goal was to be able to hover, and do it well

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:15.980
Brandon had a test for that

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.520
(Brandon) There is this stick over here, I want to see if you can land on it

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.360
(Destin) Oh you want me to land with the skids ON that stick?

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.440
(Brandon) Am I on it?
(Destin) Yeah you are!

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.140
(Brandon) I can't even...
(Destin) You're on it!...Impressive!

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.760
(Brandon) I want to see you put it down on that same spot

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:37.760
(Destin) Okay, is this like the test? If I can do this, then I...
(Brandon) You go solo right

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.320
(Destin) Dude! We're touching the stick
(Brandon laughs)

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.780
(Destin) BOOM! Touching the stick
(Brandon laughs)

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.160
(Destin) I'm very excited

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.100
(Destin) That's a big deal to me
(Brandon) Yeah, that's actually really good

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.820
- it just helps teach you precision

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.060
So there you go, hovering a helicopter is hilariously hard

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.740
I thought it was up for up, down for down, left and right

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:06.980
Oh no, it's a complex coupled control system and you have to rewire your brain to make it happen
It's pretty awesome

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:11.380
Anyway, thank you to the cities of St. Petersburg and Clearwater, Florida

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:15.140
They invited me down and sponsored this video to let me do this, it was amazing

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:19.780
I got to hover a helicopter, while my kids were playing on the beach below
That's amazing

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:21.720
Also there is plenty of other stuff you can do

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.880
They didn't tell me how to promote them so I'm just going to tell you what we did

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:28.240
We went to the Chihuly museum, which is one of the most famous glass artists in the world

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.060
There's a museum down there
Also the Salvador Dali museum

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:35.820
You know the guy, melting clocks, burning giraffes
There is a huge museum of nothing but awesome art

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:38.700
Also there's an MC Escher traveling exhibit when we were there

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.440
We got to meet Winter the Dolphin, you've heard of this dolphin

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.400
The dolphin that's missing its tail and they're working with it

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.280
We had a blast

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:48.600
If you are looking for a place to take a vacation please consider the St.Pete Clearwater Florida area

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.120
It's a great place just to go chill on the beach

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.640
If you get a chance, visit St. Pete Clearwater

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.400
Please consider it, I'll leave a link in the video description

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.640
Ah, thank you for sponsoring this, I appreciate that

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.080
Anyway, I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day, have a good one

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:07.280
(Destin) So you don't think hovering is like that?...well you're already messing it up I can tell you that right now

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:12.380
(Destin) Are you going to be a fixed wing instructor?
(Brandon) No, I have no desire to be a fixed wing instructor

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:15.600
(Destin) Why is that?
(Brandon) I don't like flying airplanes

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.860
- think about it...can you do this right here in an airplane?

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:18.720
(Destin) No

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:19.420
(Brandon) Alright then

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:25.160
We're here with Winter, the dolphin, at Clearwater Marine Aquarium and her trainers

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.320
- and your names are?
Cammy...and Julie

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.360
Alright and this is Winter's prosthetic tail

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.880
So this is were I practiced some helicopter maneuvers

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.900
And this is the Dali museum

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.180
(Destin) But you can do that with a helicopter quickly

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.500
(Destin and Michelle laugh)
