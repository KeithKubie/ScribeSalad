00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:33.710
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.740
Our lecture for today I've
entitled 'Logarithms Without

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.800
Exponents'.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.160
And before I try to clarify
that, let me make a couple of

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.390
general remarks.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.720
First of all, we have now
completed the rudiments, the

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.240
basics so to speak, of
both differential

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.550
and integral calculus.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.340
Consequently, what our next
ambition will be is to take

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.020
these principles and apply
them to special functions

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.260
which are worthy of
investigation.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.890
And you see, in connection with
this, the first function

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.670
that I've chosen to talk about
is called the logarithm.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.630
Now the other interesting thing
is that we are used to

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.570
logarithms from high school
where they were viewed as

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.980
being a different kind
of notation for

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.840
talking about exponents.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.500
Now, in the same way when
we treated the circular

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.030
functions, we mentioned that
one did not have to invent

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.670
triangles to talk about
trigonometry.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.490
The interesting point is that
one does not have to talk

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.960
about exponents to invent
the logarithm function.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.130
This is why I have entitled
the lesson, as I say,

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.010
'Logarithms without
Exponents'.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.100
You see, what I would like to do
is try to mimic, especially

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.930
from an engineering point of
view, how many of these

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.610
mathematical topics
originated.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.790
Let's look at a rather
straightforward physical

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.050
principle, a principle that I'm
sure we believe permeates

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.340
many real life situations.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.990
It's what I call the rule
of compound interest.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.000
Namely, let's suppose we have a
physical situation in which

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.490
the quantity that
we're measuring,

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:08.590
which we'll call 'm'.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.310
In other words, the rate of
change of the quantity is

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.520
proportional to the amount
present, 'dm/ dt' equals 'km'.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.750
Now notice that this is a pretty
harmless statement.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.750
The rate of change
is proportional

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:25.920
to the amount present.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.520
We certainly would expect that
many experiments would run

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.820
this way, and there seems to be
nothing at all supernatural

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.270
about this kind of
an assumption.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.090
At any rate, let's apply our
previous principles, and see

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.130
if we can't, from this
differential equation, figure

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.360
out what 'm' has to be.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.990
Separating the variables, we
get that 'dm' over 'm' is

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.860
equal to 'kdt'.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.130
And now integrating, meaning
taking the inverse derivative,

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.130
we have what?

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.310
That the integral of 'dm'
over 'm' is equal

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.830
to 'kt' plus a constant.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.300
Now you see, the interesting
point is at this stage of the

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.400
game, we do not know explicitly
how to find a

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.970
function whose derivative with
respect to 'm' is '1 over m'.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.710
In fact, that's the
problem that

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.700
underlies today's lecture.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.130
And we will try to answer this
question, showing how once we

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.760
tackle this from a philosophic
point of view, the rest of the

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.530
details follow from material
that we've already learned.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.590
At any rate, focusing our
attention on the problem, the

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.140
question is this: to determine
a function, which I'll call

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.240
capital 'L of x'--

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.820
the 'L' sort of to forewarn us
of the fact that we will

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.220
somehow get a logarithm
out of this--

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.050
such that 'L prime of
x' is '1 over x'.

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.690
And you see, what I want you to
notice is that if you write

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.750
'1 over x' in exponential form,
in other words, if you

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.340
try to write '1 over x' as 'x
to the n', notice that to

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.460
solve this problem, 'L
of x' would be what?

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.570
The integral of 'x' to
the 'minus 1 dx'.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.930
In other words, this is the case
of integral ''x to the n'

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.290
dx', with 'n' equal
to minus 1.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.350
And you'll recall that when
we studied the recipe--

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.430
let me just write that over
here-- when we studied the

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.740
recipe of how you integrate 'x
to the n', we saw that that

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:27.240
was 'x to the 'n + 1'' over
'n + 1' plus a constant.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.810
And we then observed that this
doesn't even make sense when

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.910
'n' is equal to minus 1,
because we have a 0

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.060
denominator.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.140
From the other point of view,
the way to look at

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.700
this is we said what?

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.490
That when you differentiate, you
lower the exponent by 1.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.160
Notice that to wind up with an
exponent of minus 1, we would

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.340
have had to start with
an exponent of 0.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.950
But when you differentiate 'x'
to the 0, that being a

00:04:53.950 --> 00:05:00.010
constant, the derivative
of 'x' to the 0 is 0.

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.870
It's not '1 over x'.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.620
You see, in other words, this
particular recipe that we're

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.590
talking about, we don't
have working for us.

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.180
In other words, this is an
interesting point again.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.770
You say gee whiz, if the recipe
for the integral ''x to

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.650
the n' dx' works for everything
except 'n' equals

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.730
minus 1, nothing's perfect.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.180
Let's be content.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.700
Since it works for every
number except

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.710
that one, why worry?

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.040
This is analogous to when
we talked about taking

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.220
derivatives and saw that
we get a 0 over

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.850
0 form every time.

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.260
You see, if you pick a function
at random, the

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.890
likelihood that the limit of
'f of x' as 'x' approaches

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:40.820
'a', the likelihood of that
being 0 over 0 is very small,

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.760
except when you form
the derivative, you

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.860
always get 0 over 0.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.560
And in a similar way, granted
that integral ''x' to the

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.810
minus 1 dx' is one very
special case.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.990
What we have seen is that this
comes up every single time

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.620
that we want to solve a problem
of the form 'dm/ dt'

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.040
equals 'km'.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.330
In other words then, what it
really boils down to is that

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.350
unless we can come up with
a function 'L of x' whose

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.400
derivative is '1 over x', we
cannot solve the problem that

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.230
we started off today's
lesson with.

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.610
In other words, we must leave
it in the form integral 'dm

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.760
over m' equals 'kt'
plus a constant.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.900
Well at any rate, let's see what
such a function capital

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.640
'L of x' must look like.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.050
I'm going to utilize both the
differential calculus approach

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.450
and the integral calculus
approach.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.540
By differential calculus,
assuming that 'y' equals 'L of

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.510
x', what do we know about
the function 'y'?

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:44.110
By definition, we've defined it
to be that function whose

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.330
derivative is '1 over x'.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.850
So we know its derivative
is '1 over x'.

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:53.150
The next point is that knowing
that 'y prime' is '1 over x',

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.490
and even though we can't
integrate '1 over x', we can

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.390
certainly differentiate
'1 over x'.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:59.640
We can now differentiate
'1 over x'.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.760
The derivative of '1 over x' is
minus '1 over 'x squared'',

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.870
and we find that 'y
double prime' is

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.840
minus '1 over 'x squared''.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.100
By the way, we should observe
that we must shy away from 'x'

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.400
equaling 0, because you see, we
would have a 0 denominator

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.360
in that case.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:19.780
If we think of most physical
situations, notice that we

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.240
talk about the amount--

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.160
the rate of change
is proportional

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.380
to the amount present.

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.760
From a physical point of view,
the amount present can't be

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.110
negative, so let's put the
restriction on here that the

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:36.790
domain of 'L' will be all
positive numbers.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.060
Now here's the interesting
thing.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:46.660
Intuitively, I can now visualize
how the function 'L

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:47.950
of x' must look.

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:51.100
Namely, since its first
derivative is '1 over x' and

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.620
'x' is greater than 0, that
tells me that the curve is

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.050
always rising.

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:58.750
And secondly, since '1 over 'x
squared'' is always positive,

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:01.780
minus '1 over 'x squared'' is
always negative, that tells me

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:04.650
that my curve is always
spilling water.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:07.140
In essence then, what
must the curve do?

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:10.110
The curve must be rising
but spilling water.

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:13.100
In other words, the curve
'L of x' belongs to this

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:14.410
particular family.

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:17.940
Notice that once we have one
curve which we call 'y' equals

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:21.800
'L of x', by any displacement
parallel--

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.430
vertical displacement,
we get what?

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:28.820
A member called 'y' equals
'L of x' plus 'c'.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.360
All that changes is what?

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.640
The point at which the curve
crosses the x-axis, but

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.140
whichever member of the
family we pick, what

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:38.789
typifies 'L of x'?

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:40.870
Its derivative is '1 over x'.

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:43.990
In other words, somehow or
other, we visualize that 'L of

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:48.850
x' exists, and its graph
is something like this.

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:51.860
Now suppose we want a more
tangible form, namely how do

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.760
you compute 'L of x'
for a given 'x'?

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.690
I thought what might be a nice
review now is to see how we

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:01.300
can use our integral calculus
approach, and in particular

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.730
the second fundamental theorem
of interval calculus.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:10.270
By the integral calculus
approach, we do is is we pick

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:14.000
any positive number 'a', and
once picked, we fix it.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.650
You see, we have a great deal
of freedom in how we choose

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:19.990
the positive number a.

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:22.020
But let's pick one and
leave it here.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:25.480
Now what we'll do is in the
'y-t' plane, we'll draw the

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:29.140
curve 'y' equals '1 over t'.

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:32.550
And what we'll do now, we'll
study the area of the region

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:36.910
'R' where 'R' is bounded above
by 'y' equals '1 over t', on

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:41.310
the left by 't' equals 'a', on
the right by 't' equals 'x',

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:44.420
and below by the t-axis.

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:48.080
Now we've already seen that the
function that we get by

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:52.750
taking the definite integral
from 'a' 'to x', 'dt over t',

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:56.590
has the property that its
derivative is '1 over x'.

00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:59.310
In other words, recall from the
fundamental theorem, this

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:03.120
is just a generalization of the
fact that if 'f of t' is a

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:07.480
continuous function, then the
integral from 'a' to 'x', ''f

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:11.120
of t' dt', is a function
of 'x'.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.730
And its derivative with
respect to 'x'

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:16.600
is just 'f of x'.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.490
You see, in other words, I can
now view capital 'L of x' as

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:24.920
being an area under the curve
'y' equals '1 over t'.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:28.610
Notice that I have a degree of
freedom here, namely what that

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:32.000
area is depends on where
I choose 'a'.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.490
Notice that if I choose a
differently, changing 'a'--

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:39.610
let's call this 'a
prime', say--

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:43.880
changing 'a' changes the area
under the curve, but notice it

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.150
changes it by a fixed amount.

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:50.160
In other words, notice that
shifting 'a' just changes 'L

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.440
of x' by a constant,
just like the

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.500
ordinary in definite integral.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:57.540
At any rate, these are the two
approaches that we have.

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.960
And if we superimpose them,
all we're saying is what?

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.910
If you start with the
differential calculus

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:06.970
approach, 'y' equals capital 'L
of x' must be a member of

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:11.820
this family, crossing the axis
at some point (a,0) .

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:14.770
And from the integral calculus
point of view, if you take the

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:18.010
curve 'y' equals '1 over t'
and compute the area under

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:22.420
that curve from 'a'
to 'x', that area

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:25.690
function is 'L of x'.

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:30.290
Now we'll let that rest for the
time being, and now have a

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:32.180
brief digression.

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.560
You see, sooner or later, I've
got to get to what a logarithm

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.060
is, and we might just
as well do that now.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:40.620
So let's now take a look and
see what we mean by a

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:42.280
logarithmic function.

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:46.010
You see, quite frequently in
mathematics, what one does is

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:49.950
one deals with a particular
special case in which one is

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:51.220
interested.

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:54.980
And having deduced very nice
results, he looks at this

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:58.320
thing and says, you know, all
of these results came from a

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.530
particular recipe, a particular
structure that this

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:03.130
system obeyed.

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:06.860
What he then does is he takes
this recipe or structure,

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:11.280
gives it a general name, and
now is able to extend this

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:14.870
property to a larger
class of objects.

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:16.830
For example, let's
look at this way.

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:19.990
What is the nice thing about
logarithms in the traditional

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:21.270
sense of the word?

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:24.030
Remember when we learned
logarithms in high school, by

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:27.800
use of logarithms, we were able
to replace multiplication

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.420
problems by addition problems,
et cetera.

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:33.680
In other words, remember the
key structural property was

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.610
that the logarithm of a product
was the sum of the

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:37.490
logarithms.

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:40.620
That was the structural thing
that we used over and over and

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:41.650
over again.

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:44.200
In fact, it's rather interesting
to point out that

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.050
in many cases where we used the
properties of logarithms,

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:50.370
we never really had to know
what a logarithm was.

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:52.080
All we had to know was what?

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:55.190
What properties did it obey,
and did we have a book of

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:58.610
tables so we could look up the
logarithm when we had to.

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:02.810
Well at any rate, using this as
motivation, we now define a

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:06.250
logarithmic function,
specifically a function f is

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:11.630
called logarithmic if for all
'x1', 'x2' in the domain of

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:16.140
'f', 'f' of the product of 'x1'
and 'x2' is 'f of x1'

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:17.720
plus 'f of x2'.

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.440
In other words, since we know
what nice properties a

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.670
logarithm has, let's define
any function 'f' to be

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:27.460
logarithmic if 'f' of a
product is equal to

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:31.380
the sum of the 'f's.

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:34.400
Now you see, this may sound
like a pretty simple

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.460
statement, but it's
quite demanding.

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.000
In other words, notice--

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.220
by the way, somebody says,
I wonder if there are any

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.610
logarithmic functions?

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:45.430
You see, notice that by the way
we began, there must be at

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:47.260
least one logarithmic function,

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.230
namely the usual logarithm.

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:52.580
We know there's at least one
function which has these

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:53.880
properties.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.550
So the set of all logarithmic
functions is certainly

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:57.920
not the empty set.

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:01.180
At any rate, let's see what
we can deduce about any

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:02.820
logarithmic function.

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:06.690
Well for example, I claim that
if 'f' is logarithmic, 'f of

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:08.020
1' must be 0.

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:09.150
Why is that?

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:13.110
Well, notice that 1 can be
written as 1 times 1.

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:16.530
And since 'f of 1' times
1 is 'f of 1' plus 'f

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:18.610
of 1', we have what?

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:23.040
That 'f of 1' is equal to 'f of
1' plus 'f of 1', therefore

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:27.110
twice 'f of 1' is 'f of 1',
and therefore by algebraic

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:29.780
manipulation, 'f of 1' is 0.

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:33.330
Which, by the way, does check
out with the usual logarithm,

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:37.570
the logarithm of 1 to
any base 'b' is 0.

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:41.900
Secondly, if 'f of '1 over x''
is defined, you see in other

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:45.170
words, I'm not sure whether '1
over x' is in the domain of

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:48.620
'f' just because 'x' is, but
suppose '1 over x' is in the

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:49.920
domain of 'f'.

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:55.345
Then 'f of '1 over x'' is
equal to minus 'f of x'.

00:14:55.345 --> 00:15:00.050
In other words, 'f' of a number
is minus 'f' of the

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:01.890
reciprocal of that number.

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:05.570
Again, a familiar logarithmic
property, why does it follow

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:07.050
from our basic definition?

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:11.250
Well notice that we already
know that 'f of 1' is 0.

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:16.120
We also know that 1 is equal
to 'x' times '1 over x',

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.990
provided 'x' is not 0.

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:22.280
By the way, if 'x' were 0, 1
over 0 wouldn't be defined, so

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.930
we wouldn't be worrying
about that anyway.

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:26.140
But notice now we have what?

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:31.550
If 'x' is not 0, 'f of 'x times
'1 over x'' is 0, but by

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:35.370
the logarithmic property, that's
also 'f of x' plus 'f

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:36.750
of '1 over x''.

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:41.880
Since these two together add up
to 0, 'f of '1 over x' must

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.280
just be minus 'f of x'.

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.780
And we'll just take a few more
properties like this just to

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.130
make sure that you see what
properties logarithmic

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:50.650
functions have.

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:53.490
Remember again the ordinary
logarithm, the logarithm of a

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:56.270
quotient was the difference
of the logarithms.

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:59.400
Again, 'f of 'x over y''
is equal to 'f of

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.130
x' minus 'f of y'.

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:02.530
Why is that the case?

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:04.710
Well, look at 'f
of 'x over y''.

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:08.560
That says 'f of x'
times '1 over y'.

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:12.040
But again, by logarithmic
properties, 'f' of a product

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.440
is the sum of the 'f's.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:18.310
Therefore 'f of 'x times '1 over
y''' is 'f of x' plus 'f

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:19.550
of '1 over y''.

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:24.020
But we just saw that 'f of '1
over y' is minus 'f of y'.

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:27.240
So we have this familiar
result now.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.640
And finally, by mathematical
induction, if 'n' is any

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:35.300
positive integer, 'f of x' to
the n-th power is just 'n'

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:36.810
times 'f of x'.

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:38.630
And the proof is rather clear.

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:42.070
Namely, 'f of x' to the n-th
power when 'n' is a positive

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:46.160
integer means 'f of 'x'
times 'x' times 'x'

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.440
times 'x'', 'n' times.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:52.140
And since the logarithmic
property says that 'f' of a

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:56.120
product is a sum of the 'f's,
that's equal to 'f of x' plus

00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:00.360
'f of x' plus et cetera plus 'f
of x', 'n' times, and that

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:03.290
precisely is just 'n'
times 'f of x'.

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:05.730
In other words, notice that
our definition of a

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:10.740
logarithmic function, simply
that 'f of 'x1 times x2'' is

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:15.930
equal to 'f of x1' plus 'f of
x2' allows us to deduce all of

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:19.970
the familiar properties that
were known to us in terms of

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:23.369
the traditional meaning
of logarithm.

00:17:23.369 --> 00:17:26.420
And now we come to the most
important question of today's

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:30.200
lecture, and that is what does
all of this discussion have to

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:34.220
do with the function that we've
called capital 'L of x'?

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:35.830
And that's what will
tackle next.

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:39.670
Let's take a look and see
whether capital 'L of x' is

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:43.220
indeed a logarithmic function.

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:48.540
Well, if 'L' is to be a
logarithmic function, if 'b'

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:53.220
is any constant, in particular
'L of 'b times x'' had better

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:55.830
be equal to 'L of b'
plus 'L of x'.

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:58.550
That's the definition
of logarithmic.

00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:00.210
Now we don't know
if that's true.

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:04.390
What do we have at our disposal
to be able to see

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:06.190
whether we can solve this
problem or not?

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:09.260
How do we, using calculus,
check to see whether two

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:10.750
functions are equal?

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:12.860
Remember the standard
approach is what?

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:15.730
Take the derivative
of both sides.

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:17.970
If the derivatives are
equal, then the

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:19.930
functions differ by a constant.

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:22.530
And if we can show that that
constant is 0, then the two

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:24.380
functions are equal.

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.990
So let's take a look and see
how that works over here.

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:31.230
First of all, let's see what the
derivative of 'L of bx' is

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:32.650
with respect to 'x'.

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:35.430
And by the way, here again is
the beauty of what we mean

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:39.280
when we say that all of the
study that we're making allows

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:42.340
us to utilize every fundamental
result that we've

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:43.450
learned before.

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:46.630
We've learned that the basic
definition of 'L' is what?

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:49.980
That if you differentiate 'L'
with respect to the given

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:52.960
variable, you get 1 over
that variable.

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:56.940
We want the derivative of 'L
of bx' with respect to 'x'.

00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:00.140
Now, you see the idea is the
derivative of 'L of u' with

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.590
respect to 'u' is '1 over u'.

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:06.330
You see by the chain rule, if we
were differentiating 'L of

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:12.050
bx' with respect to 'bx', that
would be '1 over bx'.

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:13.290
I shouldn't say by the
chain rule yet.

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:16.200
What I'm saying is if we
differentiate 'L of bx' with

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.680
respect to 'bx', we would
have '1 over bx'.

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.150
But we're not differentiating
with respect to 'bx', we're

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:24.410
differentiating with
respect to 'x'.

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:26.410
And this is where the
chain rule comes in.

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:31.660
Namely, we rewrite the
derivative of 'L of bx' with

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:35.730
respect to 'x' as the derivative
'L of bx' with

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:39.020
respect to 'bx' times the
derivative of 'bx' with

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:40.170
respect to 'b'.

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:41.700
And in this way we get what?

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:43.860
The first factor
is '1 over bx'.

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.990
The second factor
is 'b' itself--

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:47.310
remember 'b' is a constant--

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:52.200
and therefore the derivative
of 'L of bx' is '1 over x'.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.860
On the other hand, what is
the derivative of 'L of

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.440
b' plus 'L of x'?

00:19:56.440 --> 00:20:00.460
Since 'b' is a constant, the
derivative 'L of b' is 0.

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:03.250
And by definition, the
derivative of 'L of x' with

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:05.440
respect to 'x' is '1 over x'.

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:09.710
And now you see, comparing these
two results, we see that

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:14.430
'L of bx' and 'L of b' plus 'L
of x have the same derivative,

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:18.220
hence they differ by a constant
which I'll call 'c'.

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:21.830
In other words, notice that
capital 'L' is what I call

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:23.300
almost logarithmic.

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:26.670
If it weren't for this factor
constant 'c' in here, it would

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:28.810
be a logarithmic function.

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:30.820
Well at any rate,
what do we have?

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:34.730
We know that capital 'L of bx'
is equal to capital 'L of b'

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:38.450
plus capital 'L of x' plus
some constant 'c'.

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:42.190
To evaluate the constant, we
only have to evaluate it at

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:46.030
one element in the domain, let's
pick 'x' equal to 1.

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:49.100
The motif being that if 'x' is
1, notice that on the left

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:52.070
hand side you have an 'L of b'
term, on the right hand side

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:54.590
you have an 'L of b' term,
and they will cancel.

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:58.570
In other words, if 'x' is 1,
this equation becomes 'L of b'

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:02.500
equals 'L of b' plus 'L of 1'
plus 'c', from which it

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:06.180
follows that 'c' is
minus 'L of 1'.

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:08.060
'c' is minus 'L of 1'.

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:13.010
Now what do we want to 'c' to
be if 'c' were equal to 0?

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:17.510
If 'c' where equal to 0, this
would be logarithmic, and all

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:24.350
we need to make 'c' equal to 0
is to set 'L of 1' equal to 0.

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:28.105
In other words, summarizing this
result, capital 'L of x'

00:21:28.105 --> 00:21:31.830
is logarithmic if capital
'L of 1' is 0.

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:35.530
Now remember, we have a whole
family of 'L's that work.

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:39.180
What we're saying now is let's
pick the member of the family

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:42.660
of 'L's that passes through
the point (1,0) .

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:45.320
And because that's logarithmic,
let's give that a

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.320
special name.

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:50.160
In essence, we will define
this symbol.

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:51.750
It's written 'ln of x'.

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:55.200
It will later be called the
natural logarithm of 'x'.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:58.120
I'm trying to avoid the word
logarithm here as much as

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:01.400
possible, because I want you to
see that we haven't had to

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:04.880
use exponents at all in making
this kind of a definition.

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:09.340
But let's define 'ln of x' to
be the member of the family

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:12.080
capital 'L of x' plus
'c' which passes

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.320
through the point (1,0).

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:17.950
In essence then, what
is 'ln of x'?

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:20.800
I'll call it natural log, it's
easier for me to say.

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:24.390
The natural 'log of x' is that
function whose derivative with

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:28.470
respect to 'x' is '1 over
x', and characterized by

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:30.980
the fact that what?

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:33.620
If the input is 1,
the output is 0.

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:35.260
In other words, the graph
passes through

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:37.660
the point (1 , 0).

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:41.650
Again, notice that in terms
of what we said earlier in

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:46.190
today's lesson, we talked about
the functions 'L of x',

00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:48.880
and talked about, in the
differential calculus

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:52.290
approach, the curve could
go through any

00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:53.470
point on the x-axis.

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:56.440
What we're saying is now if the
point on the x-axis that

00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:00.860
the curve crosses at is (1 ,
0), that's what 'lnx' will

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:03.140
mean, the natural
log function.

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:06.910
In terms of the integral
calculus approach, if the

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:11.010
particular 'a' value that we
choose, the fixed value that

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:14.310
we're going to study the area
under, notice that all we're

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:16.730
saying is pick 'a' to be 1.

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:19.190
And by the way, as a
quick check, all

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.940
we're saying is what?

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:23.090
The 'natural log of x' is
defined to be the area under

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:25.200
this curve as a function
of 'x'.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.090
In terms of the definite
integral, that's the integral

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:30.760
from '1 to x,' 'dt over t'.

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:33.880
And notice that if you pick 'x'
to be 1, the natural log

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:39.330
of 1 is the integral from 1 to
1 'dt over t', and that's 0,

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:42.030
just as it should be.

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:44.340
So at any rate now, that
tells me how to

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:46.170
define the natural log.

00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:48.260
Am I doing this in terms
of exponents?

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:48.790
No.

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:50.270
I am trying to do what?

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:53.830
Find a function whose derivative
with respect to 'x'

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:57.430
is '1 over x', and I'd also like
that function, since it's

00:23:57.430 --> 00:24:01.010
that close to being a
logarithmic function, to be a

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:02.970
logarithmic function.

00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:07.250
In other words, this is how I
invented the function 'ln of

00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:09.190
x', the 'natural log of x'.

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:12.310
It's derivative with respect to
'x' is '1 over x', and the

00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:16.480
natural log of a product is the
sum of the natural logs.

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:20.050
And by the way, that's exactly
how we use this material.

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:22.970
Let me just take a few minutes
and go over something that we

00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:25.380
already had an answer
for, just to show

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:26.680
you how this works.

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:30.650
Let me try to rederive the
product rule using logarithms.

00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:33.150
Suppose 'u' and 'v' are
differentiable functions of

00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:37.360
'x', and I want to find the
derivative of 'u' times 'v'

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:38.440
with respect to 'x'.

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:41.290
In other words, I'd like
to find 'dy dx'.

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:44.480
OK, I take the natural
log of both sides.

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:47.770
In other words, I say if 'y'
equals 'u' times 'v', the

00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:53.780
natural log 'y' equals natural
log 'u times v'.

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:56.550
Now what is the property that
the natural log function has?

00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:59.840
I deliberately chose it to be
that member of the l family

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.180
that was logarithmic.

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:05.480
The natural log of 'u times
v' is 'natural log u' plus

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.590
'natural log v'.

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:11.700
Now, can I differentiate
this implicitly

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:12.760
with respect to 'x'?

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:15.500
You see how all of our
old stuff keeps

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:17.040
coming up in new context.

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:20.110
I take this equation and I
differentiate it implicitly

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:21.690
with respect to 'x'.

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:23.800
The derivative of the
left hand side is '1

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:26.160
over y', 'dy dx'.

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:29.020
The derivative of the right
hand side is what?

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:31.380
Well, the derivative of 'log u'
with respect to 'u' is '1

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:33.260
over u', but I'm differentiating
it with

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:36.740
respect to 'x', so I must use
the correction factor by the

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:38.530
chain rule 'du dx'.

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:41.670
And similarly, the derivative of
'log v' with respect to 'x'

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:44.020
is '1 over v', 'dv dx'.

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:47.790
And now multiplying through by
'y', I have obtained that 'dy

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:53.170
dx' is ''y over u' du dx'
plus ''y over v' dv dx'.

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:56.470
But remembering that 'y' is
equal to 'u' times 'v', this

00:25:56.470 --> 00:26:02.060
becomes 'v 'du dx'' plus 'u 'dv
dx', and we have arrived

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:05.870
at the familiar product
rule using logarithmic

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:07.120
differentiation.

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.290
You see the point that's really
important to stress

00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:12.190
here it that it wasn't important
whether the natural

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:13.950
log was an exponent or not.

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:16.440
The important thing that we used
about logarithms, whether

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.700
it was our high school course,
whether it's going to be in

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:22.140
our college calculus course, the
important thing was what?

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:25.580
That when we wanted to write the
log of a product, it was

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:27.580
the sum of the logs.

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:29.720
And now the only additional
fact that we have from the

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:32.820
calculus approach is that the
derivative of 'log x' with

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:36.800
respect to 'x' was defined
to be '1 over x'.

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:41.140
By the way, since there is
a tendency to think of

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:44.970
traditional logarithms when one
uses the word logarithm,

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:46.780
if we so wanted--

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:48.850
and there's no reason why
we have to do this--

00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:51.940
if we wanted to associate
a base with

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:53.540
the natural log system--

00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:56.650
this is just a little aside, and
we'll talk about this more

00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:59.720
perhaps in the learning
exercises or in the

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.780
supplementary notes
as need be--

00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:03.090
but the idea is this.

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:05.970
Notice that in a traditional
logarithm system, if the base

00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:09.380
is 'b', the base is
characterized by the fact that

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:12.400
the 'log of 'b to the
base b'' is 1.

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:18.100
Thus, if we use 'e' to denote
the base for the natural log,

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:21.820
whatever 'e' is, it must be
characterized by the fact that

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:24.050
the 'natural log of e' is 1.

00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:27.430
And the reason that I put the
word base in quotation marks

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:31.150
here is that I would like you
to observe that again, if I

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:34.640
have never heard of the word
exponent, it still makes sense

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:38.650
to say find the number e
such that the 'natural

00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:40.220
log of e' is 1.

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:43.290
In fact, I can give you two
interpretations for that

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:47.510
number 'e', and as a byproduct,
even show you why

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:50.430
the second fundamental theorem
of integral calculus is as

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:53.346
powerful as it really is.

00:27:53.346 --> 00:27:56.160
See, the idea is this.

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:59.300
To find what 'e' is, all we're
saying is take the curve 'y'

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:02.620
equals 'natural log x'.

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:05.000
Look to see where the
y-coordinate is 1.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.130
In other words, draw the
line 'y' equals 1.

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:12.020
Where that line intercepts the
curve 'y' equals 'log x', that

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:13.160
x-coordinate is 'e'.

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:16.700
In other words, the 'natural log
of e' must be 1, so this

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:19.650
is geometrically how I would
locate 'e' using

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:21.130
differential calculus.

00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:26.250
If I wanted to use integral
calculus, notice that the 'log

00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:28.440
of e' by definition is what?

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:31.960
The integral from 1 to
'e', 'dt over t'.

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:34.750
That's the area of
this region 'R'.

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:36.600
Now what do I want 'e' to be?

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:41.420
I want 'e' to be that number
that makes this area 1.

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:45.650
In other words, I want the
'natural log of e' to be 1.

00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:50.170
So again, in the same way that
one can think of pi as being

00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:53.490
geometrically constructed,
notice I can construct 'e'

00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:55.970
geometrically, namely
again what?

00:28:55.970 --> 00:29:00.450
I take the curve 'y' equals '1
over t' from 't' equals 1,

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:04.120
bounded below by the t-axis,
and I keep shifting over to

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:09.890
the right until the area of this
region 'R' is exactly 1.

00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:14.410
The 't' value that makes this
area 1 is called 'e'.

00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:17.880
And by the way, notice again
the power of what I mean by

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.200
the area approach.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:22.430
Notice I can start now to
get estimates on what

00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:23.270
'e' must look like.

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:25.530
Let me show you what I'm
driving at over here.

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:28.840
Let's suppose we take the curve
'y' equals '1 over t'

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:30.760
from 1 to 2.

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:33.480
Now what do we mean
by natural log 2?

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:38.280
Natural log 2 is by definition
the area of this region here.

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:40.980
Now notice that the smallest
height of this region, since

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:43.880
the curve is 'y' equals '1 over
t', the smallest height

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:48.080
of this region is 1/2, and the
tallest height, the highest

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:50.020
height in this region is 1.

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:54.390
Consequently, whatever the area
of this region is, it's

00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:57.280
less than the area of the
inscribed rectangle--

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:01.460
it's greater than the area of
the inscribed rectangle, and

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:05.330
less than the area of the
circumscribed rectangle.

00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:08.620
Now notice that both of these
rectangles have base 1, and

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:10.350
we're going from 1 to 2.

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:13.490
The height of the inscribed
rectangle is 1/2, therefore

00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:16.200
the area of the small
rectangle is 1/2.

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:20.930
The area of the big rectangle,
it's a 1 by 1 rectangle, is 1.

00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:25.290
And now what we have is that
whatever the natural log of 2

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:29.250
is, it being the area of this
region, it must be what?

00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:32.600
Less than 1 but greater
than 1/2.

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:35.020
We also know that whatever
'e' is, the 'log of

00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:37.530
e' is equal to 1.

00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:39.350
Well, let's go on a little
bit further.

00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:41.250
What about the log of 4?

00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:46.410
The log of 4, natural log of
4, is the log of 2 squared.

00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:51.290
But we've already seen that
one of the properties of a

00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:53.960
logarithmic function is that
you can bring the exponent

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:56.020
down as a multiplier.

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:59.340
See, 'f of 'x to the n''
is 'n 'f of x''.

00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:03.470
This becomes 2 log 2, and
because the natural log of 2

00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:06.680
is greater than 1/2, twice
the natural log of 2

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:08.890
is more than 1.

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:13.010
In other words, if log 2 is more
than 1/2, twice log 2 is

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:14.400
more than 1.

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:17.200
In other words, if we put these
three lines together, we

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:20.890
have that the natural log of 2
is less than the 'natural log

00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:24.570
of e', which in turn is less
than the natural log of 4.

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:28.490
By the way, notice that since
the derivative of 'log x' with

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:32.660
respect to 'x' is '1 over x',
and that's positive, 'log x'

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:34.580
is a one to one function.

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:38.250
Therefore, if the log of 2 is
less than the 'log of e' is

00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:42.080
less than the log of 4, it
follows that 2 must be less

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:45.230
than 'e', which in turn
must be less than 4.

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:48.450
In other words, even with this
crude approximation of just

00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:52.260
inscribing and circumscribing
rectangles, I can show again

00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:56.410
without reference to exponents
that whatever the number 'e'

00:31:56.410 --> 00:32:02.330
is, the number e defined by the
fact that 'ln of e' is 1,

00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:06.400
that number 'e' is some number
between 2 and 4.

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:08.830
But again, we won't dwell
on this too long.

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:12.000
What I want to do now is to come
back to a summary point,

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.570
and at the same time,
lead into the

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:16.020
lecture for next time.

00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:20.790
Recall that we began this
lecture with the problem of

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:24.740
solving the situation where
the rate of change was

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:27.390
proportional to the
amount present.

00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:31.180
Given 'dm/ dt' equals 'km', we
separated variables and got

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:34.920
down to the stage where the
integral of 'dm over m' was

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:36.880
'kt' plus a constant.

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:40.540
And all we did in the rest of
today's lecture that was at

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:45.350
all different, was we invented
and constructed the particular

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:48.970
function whose derivative would
be '1 over m', and which

00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:50.550
had the logarithmic property.

00:32:50.550 --> 00:32:52.920
In other words, we can now
say that this is the

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:54.340
answer to the problem.

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:58.240
This problem is explicitly
solved because the natural log

00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:00.690
function can be viewed as
an area under a curve.

00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:02.950
We can construct it
for each 'm'.

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:05.400
This is then what we
managed to do.

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:08.800
And by the way, all I'm saying
now is that since the log is a

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:10.250
one to one function--

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:12.250
see, its derivative is
always positive--

00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:14.670
can't we talk about the
inverse function?

00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:16.880
In other words, notice that
another way of writing this is

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:21.720
that id 'natural log m' is 'kt'
plus 'c', 'm' itself must

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:26.490
be the 'inverse log
of kt' plus 'c'.

00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:30.450
And you see, next time what
we're going to do is to

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:35.610
explore what we mean
by the inverse log.

00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:39.300
At any rate, in summarizing
today's lecture, to make sure

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:43.250
that we didn't fall victim to
all the computational details,

00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:46.500
notice that all we did was
physically motivated the

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:50.070
necessity for inventing a
function whose derivative with

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:51.920
respect to 'x' was '1 over x'.

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:55.900
And from that point on,
everything else that we did

00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:59.730
followed as applications of
material that came before.

00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:03.980
It's in this sense that the
course now picks up in tempo.

00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:07.050
That as we go on now, we're
going to be able to cover

00:34:07.050 --> 00:34:10.679
larger globs of material in one
sitting, because we will

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:14.130
find, at least for the next
several lectures, that every

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:18.989
new topic is basically one new
idea together with all of the

00:34:18.989 --> 00:34:20.330
old recipes.

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:22.330
At any rate, until next
time, goodbye.
