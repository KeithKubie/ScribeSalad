What was your job when you were four years
old?

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.670
If you didn’t have one, congratulations,
you’re normal.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.690
However that’s not always the case, for
some of the stars on our list, they were already

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.170
working towards becoming the famous actors
that they are today.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.350
Everyone knows about Neil Patrick Harris being
a child star, but what about some of the lesser-known

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:30.600
stories?

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.690
Scarlett Johansson
In recent years, Scarlett Johansson has become

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.950
one of the most dependable box office babes
in Hollywood.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.700
She can do everything from action packed Marvel
movies to psychological thrillers and she

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.580
looks damn good doing it.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.110
Scarjo is no newcomer to the industry, though,
as she was actually a child star.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.390
Back in 1994 she was in the movie North with
Elijah Wood and she was only nine years old

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.390
at the time.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.140
Young Johansson continued to work on multiple
small movies and TV shows until she matured

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.659
into the beauty that she is today and sky
rocketed to the top of every casting directors

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.270
wish list.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.890
Ryan Reynolds
Ryan Reynolds is one of the most liked and

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.229
respected men working in Hollywood right now
and the whole world really fell in love with

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:35.100
the Canadian actor after his incredible performance
as Deadpool.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.979
It’s pretty safe to say that Reynolds will
have no trouble finding work in the coming

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.829
years, but as it turns out, he actually got
his start in the business at a pretty young

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:46.829
age.

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.921
When Ryan Reynolds was 15 years old he snagged
himself a recurring role on the show Fifteen

00:01:50.921 --> 00:01:52.920
or Hillside as Billy Simpson in.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.861
The teen drama was produced by Nickelodeon
and dealt with issues like drugs and alcohol.

00:01:56.861 --> 00:01:57.861
Ariel Winter
Ariel Winter has been playing the nerdy Alex

00:01:57.861 --> 00:01:58.861
Dunphy on the hit comedy Modern Family for
years now, but it turns out her career actually

00:01:58.861 --> 00:01:59.861
started at a much younger age.

00:01:59.861 --> 00:02:00.861
When the actress was four years old she actually
starred in a Cool Whip commercial, which means

00:02:00.861 --> 00:02:01.861
that she has been working for over fifteen
years now.

00:02:01.861 --> 00:02:02.861
It seems like Ariel was always determined
to succeed as she had no problem dying her

00:02:02.861 --> 00:02:03.861
hair black at the age of seven because someone
told her it would help her land roles.

00:02:03.861 --> 00:02:04.861
Winter has recently matured into quite a stunning
woman who has no problem flaunting what she’s

00:02:04.861 --> 00:02:05.861
got.

00:02:05.861 --> 00:02:06.861
Rose Byrne
Rose Byrne is sneakily becoming one of the

00:02:06.861 --> 00:02:07.861
biggest names in comedy.

00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:08.861
She’s recently been in Spy, Neighbors (and
it’s sequel), This is Where I Leave You

00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:10.759
and Bridesmaids to name a few.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.560
Hollywood seems to be falling in love with
Byrne but chances are that most audience members

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.200
don’t know that she has been working for
a long time.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.510
Byrne’s first role came when she was 13
years old in 1994 in a movie called Dallas

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.510
Doll.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.590
She then continued to do TV work in Australia
until she later broke into the Hollywood movie

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.590
scene.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:40.790
We expect her career to continue to ascend
as she continues to rack up great performances.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.269
Joaquin Phoenix
There is no denying that Joaquin Phoenix is

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:49.390
one of the weirdest people in Hollywood, but
that doesn’t mean that he isn’t incredibly

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.390
talented.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.200
People mostly recognize Phoenix from his Oscar
nominated work but people probably don’t

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.440
know much about his work as a child actor.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.200
He started out with small parts on television
shows and his first role was on Seven Brides

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.000
for Seven Brother in 1982 when he was only
eight years old.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.659
Back then you wouldn’t have called him “Joaquin”
though as he spent the early years of his

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:11.260
career being credit as “Leaf Phoenix”.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.420
It wasn’t until many years later that he
made the switch to Joaquin, prompting years

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.640
and years of people mispronouncing his name.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.940
Jake Gyllenhaal
Jake Gyllenhaal could be one of the most underrated

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.980
actors working today as he already has a very
impressive resume including films like has

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.880
a pretty serious career with movies like Donnie
Darko, Nightcrawler, and Brokeback Mountain.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.590
But what many people probably don’t know
is that the actor got a really early start

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:34.620
on his career.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.890
He played the little boy named Danny Robbins
in 1991’s City Slickers with Billy Crystal.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.910
He went on to be Leon in Josh and S.A.M.,
where two young brothers go on a crazy cross-country

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:45.910
adventure together.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.250
This is where he came across Martha Plimpton,
who he had a crush on.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.980
Christian Bale
Christian Bale is one of the most respected

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.689
actors working today and he has racked up
some amazing performances in movies like The

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:00.410
Prestige, The Big Short and of course Christopher
Nolan’s Batman trilogy.

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.140
Most child stars start out with goofy or somewhat
embarrassing roles, but that certainly is

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.900
not the case with Bale.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.019
Back in 1987, Christian Bale got his big break
when he landed a leading role in Spielberg’s

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:17.680
film, Empire of the Sun, which is pretty impressive
seeing as he was only thirteen years old at

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.680
the time.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.220
Only 42 years young, it looks like the world
is going to get to see many more years of

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.930
great Christian Bale performances!

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.680
Natalie Portman
Anyone who saw a 12-year-old Portman in Léon:

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.470
The Professional knew she'd eventually end
up winning an Oscar.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.680
Portman took home the Best Actress honor for
her role in Black Swan and there is already

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.410
award buzz surrounding her latest film, Jackie.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.360
Portman is as talented as she is stunning
and it is no surprise that she has been able

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.940
to mature so well from a child star to a bankable
leading woman.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.370
Portman has done a bit of everything from
Star Wars, to Marvel movies to Oscar-bait

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.900
films and we can only imagine that she will
continue to impress with her next performances.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.270
Ryan Gosling
Some people were surprised to see the studly

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:04.229
Ryan Gosling singing and dancing in the critically
acclaimed La La Land, but true fans of his

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:06.860
know that he is actually just returning to
his roots.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.050
Ryan Gosling was a child star when he was
a part of the famous Mickey Mouse club.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.360
While many of his co-stars like Brittany Spears
and Justin Timberlake continued on the singing

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.690
path, Gosling decided to turn his focus towards
acting.

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.300
It seems like it was the right call as he
has undoubtedly blossomed into one of the

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.590
biggest male stars in Hollywood.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:40.820
That being said, it is nice to see him singing
and dancing again, just like the 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:06:06.380
old days!

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.740
Chloe Grace Moretz
Chloe Grace Moretz is one of the hottest young

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.740
names in Hollywood and she seems to be popping
up all over the place these days.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.199
Lately, she is undeniably garnering more attention
for her great and matured looks but she is

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:22.419
definitely not new to the spotlight as she
is already somewhat of a Hollywood veteran,

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:24.070
even though she is yet to turn twenty.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.380
Moretz started working at the age of seven
on the TV Show The Guardian and then her big

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:32.569
break came the next year when she starred
in the remake of The Amityville Horror.

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:36.520
This great performance helped her land the
Hit-Girl role in Kick-Ass and it seems like

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.370
she hasn’t stopped working since.

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.419
Chloe Grace Moretz is now maturing into a
beautiful, smart and talented young woman

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:45.980
and she is definitely an example of a child
star growing up properly!

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:50.120
So there’s our list of ten famous actors
