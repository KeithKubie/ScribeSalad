00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And I would say the answers are comparing auto repair rates.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Those are simply proportions that can be compared to each other

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
as we've done for many things.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And determining if a course improve test scores.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We would argue that we can't compare crash rates of two airlines with 100 flights

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
because in general there aren't crashes.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Now in theory, you could say you can use a hypothesis test

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
if you recognize that it's not normally distributed and do the appropriate

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
binomial test and figure out that you can't determine anything

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
but it's generally not adding anything over intuition.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And comparing heights of the tallest building in two cities, that's a deterministic number.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
It's either their taller or it's not. There are no random errors. There's no need for a hypothesis test.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
That again a more creative application could be that you'd want to use it to

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
the measurements of the buildings in each of the two cities to determine whether

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
one was taller but that's only going to be useful if the measurements have the error

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
on the same order of the difference in buildings which is unusual.

00:01:10.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So in practice you would not use a hypothesis test there.
