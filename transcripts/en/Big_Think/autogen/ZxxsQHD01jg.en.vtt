00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:07.870
 
so reproductive technologies is sort of

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:07.880
so reproductive technologies is sort of
 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.150
so reproductive technologies is sort of
a family of technologies we have in

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.160
a family of technologies we have in
 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.850
a family of technologies we have in
vitro fertilization where essentially an

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:12.860
vitro fertilization where essentially an
 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.100
vitro fertilization where essentially an
egg is being fertilized outside of the

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:15.110
egg is being fertilized outside of the
 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:16.810
egg is being fertilized outside of the
body so that involves harvesting eggs

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820
body so that involves harvesting eggs
 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.970
body so that involves harvesting eggs
from women and then implanting a sperm

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980
from women and then implanting a sperm
 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.560
from women and then implanting a sperm
into that and putting it in there are

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570
into that and putting it in there are
 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.839
into that and putting it in there are
some variations on that another very

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:22.849
some variations on that another very
 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:25.150
some variations on that another very
common form of reproductive technology

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160
common form of reproductive technology
 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.089
common form of reproductive technology
is surrogacy in surrogacy and embryo is

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099
is surrogacy in surrogacy and embryo is
 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.370
is surrogacy in surrogacy and embryo is
being carried by a woman who's not

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380
being carried by a woman who's not
 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.230
being carried by a woman who's not
typically the genetic mother of the

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:32.240
typically the genetic mother of the
 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.320
typically the genetic mother of the
child so another woman is carrying the

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:35.330
child so another woman is carrying the
 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.930
child so another woman is carrying the
egg and sperm combined into a foetus and

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940
egg and sperm combined into a foetus and
 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.120
egg and sperm combined into a foetus and
then we have a series of other brand new

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:40.130
then we have a series of other brand new
 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.190
then we have a series of other brand new
technologies like mitochondrial

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200
technologies like mitochondrial
 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.260
technologies like mitochondrial
replacement therapy where you're taking

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270
replacement therapy where you're taking
 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.990
replacement therapy where you're taking
the egg from one woman you're removing

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000
the egg from one woman you're removing
 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.880
the egg from one woman you're removing
the mitochondria from that egg and

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890
the mitochondria from that egg and
 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.650
the mitochondria from that egg and
putting in the mitochondria from another

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660
putting in the mitochondria from another
 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.740
putting in the mitochondria from another
egg to deal with mitochondrial disease

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750
egg to deal with mitochondrial disease
 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.600
egg to deal with mitochondrial disease
and here there's an idea that there's

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610
and here there's an idea that there's
 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.880
and here there's an idea that there's
actually three genetic parents

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890
actually three genetic parents
 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.800
actually three genetic parents
there's the genetic father provides the

00:00:59.800 --> 00:00:59.810
there's the genetic father provides the
 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.350
there's the genetic father provides the
sperm there's the mitochondria donor and

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360
sperm there's the mitochondria donor and
 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.580
sperm there's the mitochondria donor and
then there's the woman who donates the

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590
then there's the woman who donates the
 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.380
then there's the woman who donates the
rest of the egg so in reality there's

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390
rest of the egg so in reality there's
 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.179
rest of the egg so in reality there's
three genetic parents even though the

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189
three genetic parents even though the
 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:08.770
three genetic parents even though the
mitochondrial donor and only giving a

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780
mitochondrial donor and only giving a
 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.319
mitochondrial donor and only giving a
very small part of the genetic material

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:11.329
very small part of the genetic material
 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:14.800
very small part of the genetic material
in the DNA those are three reproductive

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810
in the DNA those are three reproductive
 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.690
in the DNA those are three reproductive
technologies two are very common one is

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700
technologies two are very common one is
 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.880
technologies two are very common one is
brand-new and of course the oldest one

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890
brand-new and of course the oldest one
 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.380
brand-new and of course the oldest one
that we have is artificial insemination

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390
that we have is artificial insemination
 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.739
that we have is artificial insemination
and in fact this goes back to the 1800s

00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:23.749
and in fact this goes back to the 1800s
 

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:25.450
and in fact this goes back to the 1800s
I believe in the United States at least

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460
I believe in the United States at least
 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.459

and this is essentially what a man

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:27.469
and this is essentially what a man
 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:30.760
and this is essentially what a man
ejaculates his sperm and it's used to

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770
ejaculates his sperm and it's used to
 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.099
ejaculates his sperm and it's used to
inseminate a woman typically through an

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:33.109
inseminate a woman typically through an
 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:34.899
inseminate a woman typically through an
injection although the old things they

true you can do at-home insemination

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869
true you can do at-home insemination
 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.809
true you can do at-home insemination
with a turkey baster so those are four

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:40.819
with a turkey baster so those are four
 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:43.090

what distinguishes those cases we
identify a principal say this is the

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:38.390
good principal does it have to be thrown
 

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.450

out can it be refined okay so that's a

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:40.460
out can it be refined okay so that's a
 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.010
out can it be refined okay so that's a
very abstract way of putting it

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:42.020
very abstract way of putting it
 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.440
very abstract way of putting it
now let me try to just try and put it in

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:44.450
now let me try to just try and put it in
 

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:46.090
now let me try to just try and put it in

could make an alteration and we could
 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.730
could make an alteration and we could
either do this and the question be if it

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:57.740
either do this and the question be if it
 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:58.840
either do this and the question be if it
would be different to do it this way

00:06:58.840 --> 00:06:58.850
would be different to do it this way
 

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:00.970

that end and imagine now the goal is to

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:11.450
that end and imagine now the goal is to
 

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.090
that end and imagine now the goal is to
produce a set of children who will do

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:13.100
produce a set of children who will do

reactions to that case maybe they think

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:21.050
reactions to that case maybe they think
 

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:22.930
reactions to that case maybe they think
it's wrong because for controlling these

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:22.940
it's wrong because for controlling these

we want to test it against a very
 

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.210
we want to test it against a very
different kind of case and that's the

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:37.220
different kind of case and that's the
 

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.850
different kind of case and that's the
kind of SAT tutoring for example there

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:39.860
kind of SAT tutoring for example there
 

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.310

have a strong negative moral reaction to
 

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.270
have a strong negative moral reaction to
the idea of tutoring and the pressure

the idea of tutoring and the pressure
 

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.760
the idea of tutoring and the pressure
point to ask yourself is are the

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:57.770
point to ask yourself is are the
 

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:59.650
point to ask yourself is are the
tutoring examples different from the

both have the aim of improving the

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:03.530
both have the aim of improving the
 

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:04.900
both have the aim of improving the

intelligence of the performance of
 

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:06.640
intelligence of the performance of
children and then we can throw in other

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:06.650
children and then we can throw in other
 

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:08.860
children and then we can throw in other
cases performance-enhancing drugs in

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:08.870
cases performance-enhancing drugs in
 

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:12.840
cases performance-enhancing drugs in
sports for example versus the use of

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:12.850
sports for example versus the use of
 

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:15.550
sports for example versus the use of
adderall and other drugs to cram for

adderall and other drugs to cram for
 

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.040
adderall and other drugs to cram for
exams and colleges now we have four

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:18.050
exams and colleges now we have four
 

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:20.860

kinds of cases we have doping in sports

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:20.870
kinds of cases we have doping in sports
 

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.600
kinds of cases we have doping in sports
you've got college students doing

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:22.610
you've got college students doing
 

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:24.940
you've got college students doing
adderall we've got tutoring and then we

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:24.950
adderall we've got tutoring and then we
 

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:26.710
adderall we've got tutoring and then we
have genetic enhancements so now the

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:26.720
have genetic enhancements so now the
 

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.000
have genetic enhancements so now the
question is we have a pattern of

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:28.010
question is we have a pattern of
 

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:30.400
question is we have a pattern of
reactions to these cases can we derive a

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:30.410
reactions to these cases can we derive a
 

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:32.650
reactions to these cases can we derive a
set of principles or distinctions that

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:32.660
set of principles or distinctions that
 

00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:34.240
set of principles or distinctions that
make a difference and help explain these

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:34.250
make a difference and help explain these
 

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:36.460
make a difference and help explain these
intuitions and then also can be used for

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:36.470
intuitions and then also can be used for
 

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:38.410

new cases in ways that are satisfactory
 

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:40.420
new cases in ways that are satisfactory
so kinds of lines might draws the

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:40.430
so kinds of lines might draws the
 

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:42.670
so kinds of lines might draws the
difference between biological versus non

difference between biological versus non
 

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.830

biological enhancement now all forms of
 

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.380

learning are really biological deep down
 

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:49.450
learning are really biological deep down
but you might think the biological

you might also try and draw distinctions

00:08:59.749 --> 00:08:59.759
you might also try and draw distinctions
 

00:08:59.759 --> 00:09:01.999
you might also try and draw distinctions
between who's making the decision as to

00:09:01.999 --> 00:09:02.009
between who's making the decision as to
 

00:09:02.009 --> 00:09:04.100

who will be enhanced in the case of this

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:04.110
who will be enhanced in the case of this
 

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:06.170
who will be enhanced in the case of this
sports player or in the case of the

there's a lot of self agency the person

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:10.920
there's a lot of self agency the person
 

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.079
there's a lot of self agency the person
is choosing for themselves

00:09:12.079 --> 00:09:12.089
is choosing for themselves
 

00:09:12.089 --> 00:09:15.199
is choosing for themselves
in the case of a parent choosing who

00:09:15.199 --> 00:09:15.209
in the case of a parent choosing who
 

00:09:15.209 --> 00:09:16.759
in the case of a parent choosing who
will be the sperm or egg donor or

00:09:16.759 --> 00:09:16.769
will be the sperm or egg donor or
 

00:09:16.769 --> 00:09:18.499
will be the sperm or egg donor or
choosing what genetic manipulations to

00:09:18.499 --> 00:09:18.509
choosing what genetic manipulations to
 

00:09:18.509 --> 00:09:20.689
choosing what genetic manipulations to
do to an early embryo you have someone

00:09:20.689 --> 00:09:20.699
do to an early embryo you have someone
 

00:09:20.699 --> 00:09:22.879

else imposing the will does that help
 

00:09:22.889 --> 00:09:24.949
else imposing the will does that help
explain our intuitions and so on and so

00:09:24.949 --> 00:09:24.959
explain our intuitions and so on and so
 

00:09:24.959 --> 00:09:26.840
explain our intuitions and so on and so
and so forth gets pretty complex you

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:26.850
and so forth gets pretty complex you
 

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:28.939
and so forth gets pretty complex you
start drawing charts of distinctions and

00:09:28.939 --> 00:09:28.949
start drawing charts of distinctions and
 

00:09:28.949 --> 00:09:29.749
start drawing charts of distinctions and
thinking about it

00:09:29.749 --> 00:09:29.759
thinking about it
 

00:09:29.759 --> 00:09:31.490
thinking about it
but in this form of contestation we can

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:31.500
but in this form of contestation we can
 

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.559
but in this form of contestation we can
try to get really to understand what we

00:09:33.559 --> 00:09:33.569
try to get really to understand what we
 

00:09:33.569 --> 00:09:38.450
try to get really to understand what we
really think
