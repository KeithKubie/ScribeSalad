00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.279
[Anna]: We live in a world where it's become not only normal to share incredibly personal information...

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.279
But encouraged, whether that's a vague tweet...

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.440
[Congress]: I never get treats anymore... I'm not sure if it's a human who takes care of me OR A BITCH!

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.260
[Anna]: Hey! You little f---.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.940
Or a very specific detailed post on Facebook.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:26.360
[Congress]: I lifted up my leg and lift my penis today for 45 minutes... It was the only treat I got.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.160
[Anna]: Ew...

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.240
And I started wondering: is all of this oversharing bad?

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.480
I have always been on the side of optimistic about technology

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.940
and really loving the potential of the Internet,

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.540
but I understand that not everybody sees it like I do.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.380
*Flashes 2nd Anna*
[2nd Anna]: Oh my gah.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.620
[Anna]: I mean obviously I'm not one to talk. I share...

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.560
horribly personal information to hundreds of thousands of strangers on the Internet.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.770
And I like to think that I'm helping
and I'm putting myself out there

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.420
and I'm somehow reaching human beings

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.140
through this cold-impersonal-digital-landscape.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.340
But, you know, maybe people are actually watching because I'm such a shit-show you can't turn away.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.680
*Flashes 2nd Anna*
[2nd Anna]: *Screams in horror*

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.560
[Anna]: This is a topic that I've thought a lot about. 
And I knew my oversharing was...

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.920
really unhealthy when a few years ago my brother

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.360
and I walked into my house, to find that this small bird had been ripped apart by my cats.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.220
[3rd Anna]: ...oh my god, that was crazy right? *laughs*

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:36.000
*le gasp* *le screams*

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.069
[Anna]: It's horrible right? Like the thirst for attention is real.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.020
And so now I know if you're frantically trying to capture a moment before you can genuinely react to it.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.000
It's probably a bad sign.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.400
[4th Anna]: *frantic* Oh my god, omg, omg, omg... Wait please. Can we at least take a selfie before I die.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.720
[Killer]: Oh yeah, of course.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.180
[4th Anna]: Oh okay, good. You ready?

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.780
(1, 2, 3 *picture snap*) x3.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.280
Are you happy with that one?
[Killer]: Oh, ... can I? *does hair*
[4th Anna]: Oh yeah, for sure for sure.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.000
[Killer]: Look good?
[4th Anna]: Mmh. There you go.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.800
[4th Anna]: Wait, do you have like a prop? Like were you gonna stab me or something?

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.880
[Killer]: I was gonna... *choking motion*

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.520
[4th Anna]: Choke? Can you do that? I'll look scary. Ready?

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.360
(And *picture snap*) x3

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.760
[4th Anna]: R. I. P. me.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.720
Cool, I'm ready to die now. *chokes*

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.440
[Anna]: And so now I try to manage myself by asking: why exactly am I sharing this?

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.280
Am I hoping to spread the word about a good cause?

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.600
Do I want to inspire or help someone?

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.720
Or do I just want to make someone hella jelly?

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.440
[5th Anna]: *picture snap* x3

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.680
[5th Anna]: *typing* Look and how good of a mom I am...

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.800
[Anna]: With sharing, I've oscillate a lot between...

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.600
loving the potential and hating the reality.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.680
Because even when it seems like someone is sharing something genuine, when it's online,

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.049
it can't be a hundred percent genuine, because we all know how we come across when we post things,

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:21.689
there's always gonna be a part of you that purposely paints yourself in the best light. And I am no exception,

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:25.760
I mean I know the more honest I am, 
usually the better the message in the video,

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.080
so even my honesty is ultimately motivated by how sharing with others is going to benefit me.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.680
But I do believe in the power of oversharing, I do, 
I think it's because of the vast

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.480
overpopulated nature of the internet that you can learn about anything that literally piques your interest.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.560
Like I can find out how many other people have these gross red bumps on their legs

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.520
from hiking in Machu Picchu or

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.840
if I want to know what it's like to get a colonoscopy: I can read dozens of accounts or even pegging, if I'm like what

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.610
is pegging like for those people? I can read about all the different couples and what they think about this topic.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.250
TMI, there's just no such thing anymore.

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.410
The Internet is ultimately a tool

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:07.329
and how you choose to utilize that tool is completely up to you. Whether you're addicted or isolated from it,

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:12.560
whether it's a great source of knowledge or an awful place with misogyny. In any extreme or

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.320
moderation, the knowledge is out there.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.880
It's kind of up to you how much you want to contribute.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.280
I'm Anna Akana, stay right here for an animated sponsored message from Miss Bethany Radloff.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.040
And I also want to say thank you to Meghan McCarthy for doing the voice of Congress.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.590
Your voice is so adorable and great. 
Please check out her channel.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.000
She's an amazing voice-over artist and actress and all the things.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.160
And stay right here to hear her talk some more.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.240
[Meghan McCarthy]: Hey guys! It's Meghan McCarthy.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.400
You should click on my face here to watch some of my videos.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.600
Go on, do it, touch my face.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.720
It's okay.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.640
[Congress]: *burps* 
Thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring today's video.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.080
Squarespace has an array of award-winning templates, blah blah blah.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.080
Do I really have to do this mom? *groan*

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.920
They have an all-in-one platform, 
which means no installs, patches, or upgrades ever.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.200
WHO CARES ABOUT THIS MOM?

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.680
24-hour customer service, simple domain setup experience, any kind of website...

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.280
You've been doing these ads for two years, people already know this.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.200
Do I really have to tell them to go to squarespace.com

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.440
to start their free trial and use the offer code "ANNA" for 10% off at checkout? *sigh*

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.340
*sigh* Fine. Whatever.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.650
Squarespace.
