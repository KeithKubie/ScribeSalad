00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.480
We’ve all heard the horror stories, the
teenage couple gets pregnant the first time,

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.629
or gets pregnant without doing it all à la
Scrubs.

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:09.830
but really, how hard is it to get pregnant?

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.310
Hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.160
As more men and women push back their biological
clocks to match up with their professional

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.050
ambitions, fertility issues seem to be on
the rise.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.079
But the thing is, it’s pretty easy to get
pregnant.

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:26.749
Especially if you’re in the prime biological
age range, which most researchers agree for

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:33.120
women is between 20-35 and men too experience
a decline in fertility as they age.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.180
And before you ask, yes you can get pregnant
the first time you have sex, yes you can get

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.420
pregnant standing up, yes you can get pregnant
if you have sex on your period, yes you can

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.790
get pregnant even without ejaculation!

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.850
Among couples without fertility problems,
60 percent will be pregnant within three months,

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.320
and 75 percent within six months.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.530
About 85 percent of all couples will get pregnant
within a year, but it's not all sunshine and

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.570
roses and babies.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.519
Besides age, the weirdest things can affect
your fertility.

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:01.510
Like research from the from the Norwegian
University of Science and Technology found

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.220
that women who work out too much can have
reduced fertility.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.579
In a large study of nearly 3,000 women researchers
found that those who train or exercise everyday

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:13.659
and those who train until they’re exhausted
had lower fertility than other women.

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:15.300
Smoking is another fertility damper.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.320
One study published in the journal Obstetrics
&amp; Gynecology found that women who smoked produced

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.630
less eggs when undergoing fertility treatments.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.740
For every 10-pack years of smoking, women
produced 2.5 fewer mature oocytes and two

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.030
less embryos.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.600
And multiple other studies back up the smoking
and fertility issues link.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.060
Water bottles too can affect your chances
of getting pregnant.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.990
BPA stands for Bisphenol A, can be found in
a lot of plastic things, like receipts and

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.990
water bottles.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.310
The chemical helps plastic be more flexible
keeps it from breaking.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.119
Unfortunately, it leaks from those products
pretty easily.

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:47.790
Like into your water in your bottle.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.939
Several studies link BPA exposure to troubles
with conceiving.

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.710
One study published in the journal Human Reproduction
found a link between women’s exposure to

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.310
the chemical and lower fertility.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.680
They found that women with higher levels of
BPA levels produced less eggs during fertility

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.640
treatments, like 24 percent fewer eggs.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.850
But it doesn’t just cause problems with
women.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.980
One study found that men who had high levels
of the chemical experienced a 20% decline

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:09.980
in fertility.

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:13.450
Basically the chemical mimics estrogen and
lowers men’s sperm count.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.150
And men should be wary of another factor,
summertime.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.750
Another study published in the journal Reproduction
found that men seemed to have trouble during

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:20.750
the summer.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.849
In a study of over 2200 men, researchers in
the UK found that men who produced a lot less

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.370
sperm, were twice as likely to have produced
that sample during the summer.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.520
And the researchers aren’t so sure why that
is, some think it might have to do with sunlight.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.040
Sperm is produced a few months before it’s
released as ejaculate, so that sperm sample

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.769
given during the summer might have been made
a few months before when it was dark and grey

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:41.769
in England.

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.480
So maybe the lack of vitamin D had something
to do with lower sperm count.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.790
More research is needed.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.830
So if you are trying to conceive, avoid smoking,
plastic, summer, and some studies say to avoid

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.290
tight whiteys too.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.569
And no matter your troubles, researchers say
“the most important thing for people trying

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.730
to conceive is having a lot of sex.”

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.400
And once you are pregnant it seems there’s
all these rules and weird superstitions, to

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:12.510
separate fact from fiction, check out this
great video on the top 5 pregnancy myths.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.430

a baby?
