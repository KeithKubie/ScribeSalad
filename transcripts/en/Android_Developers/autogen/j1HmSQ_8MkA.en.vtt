00:00:06.292 --> 00:00:09.042
Mobills came from a need of mine.

00:00:09.083 --> 00:00:11.250
I used to control my finances
    through spreadsheets.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.750
I thought it would be a good idea

00:00:12.792 --> 00:00:15.292
to develop an app
    so that I could control my finances

00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:16.917
in a more practical and easy way.

00:00:16.917 --> 00:00:18.625
When I launched it on Google Play,

00:00:18.625 --> 00:00:21.792
many users started downloading it,
    and the business started.

00:00:23.833 --> 00:00:26.708
Mobills is a free platform and app,

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.625
which people use
    to start controlling their finances.

00:00:30.625 --> 00:00:34.375
However, in order to have access
    to all of the app's functions,

00:00:34.375 --> 00:00:36.125
they pay a monthly subscription.

00:00:38.042 --> 00:00:39.958
This year we have had
    a significant increase

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.167
in the number of Android subscriptions.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.250
That is due to many tools from Google Play
    which we started to use.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.792
We realized that we had a great issue,

00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:52.917
in which we had many users that

00:00:52.917 --> 00:00:56.458
used our free app
    for a long period of time.

00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.667
Using Firebase Remote Config,

00:00:59.708 --> 00:01:02.667
along with introductory price,
    we developed a strategy

00:01:02.667 --> 00:01:05.583
to offer progressive discounts
    to our users,

00:01:05.625 --> 00:01:09.625
in which, starting from 100 days of use,
    we offered a 10% discount.

00:01:09.625 --> 00:01:12.000
With 200 days, we offered 20%.

00:01:12.042 --> 00:01:14.667
From 300 days, 30%.

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:19.333
After 400 days of free use,
    we offered up to 50% discount

00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:22.708
using introductory price.
    That led us to see

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.417
a 30% increase in converting
    users into subscribers

00:01:26.458 --> 00:01:30.083
and a 20% increase
    in our average weekly revenue.

00:01:31.667 --> 00:01:34.917
In order to retain our users,
    we started using a grace period,

00:01:34.917 --> 00:01:38.083
in which we enabled seven days
    for the user to resolve

00:01:38.083 --> 00:01:40.625
any issues they might have had
    with payment.

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:44.625
We perceived a 40% decrease
    in the number of involuntary churns.

00:01:45.125 --> 00:01:47.708
We started using real-time notification,

00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:51.125
which helps users
    to receive real-time notifications

00:01:51.167 --> 00:01:54.292
if there is any error
    with their payment method.

00:01:54.292 --> 00:01:56.958
We have also seen a positive impact

00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.792
in decreasing the number
    of cancelled subscriptions.

00:02:01.125 --> 00:02:03.333
My advice to other developers

00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:06.708
is to use all of
    Google Play Console's available tools.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.583
To use a grace period
    in order to decrease involuntary churns.

00:02:10.583 --> 00:02:14.125
To use introductory price
    in order to offer discounts

00:02:14.167 --> 00:02:16.250
to users who are not subscribed yet.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.625
To work on the app's quality.

00:02:18.667 --> 00:02:21.417
And to really build an app
    that has great usability.

00:02:21.417 --> 00:02:24.375
Quality has always been key
    to our business' growth.
