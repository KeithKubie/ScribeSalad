Congratulations. You've made it to the end of this unit and made it to the end

00:00:04.298 --> 00:00:07.955
of the course. And you now have a search engine running as a web application and

00:00:07.955 --> 00:00:11.535
a way to separate the crawling part from the server. There's certainly a lot you

00:00:11.535 --> 00:00:14.955
can do to improve that but let's recap what we've learned in this unit. You

00:00:14.955 --> 00:00:19.075
learned about how to set up a web application using web.py. And that led us to

00:00:19.075 --> 00:00:23.406
the more broadly applicable idea of regular expressions. And then we looked at

00:00:23.406 --> 00:00:27.019
how to use files. And to deal with files well, we needed to understand

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:32.637
exceptions. And you use try and except and finally to do that, as well as the

00:00:32.637 --> 00:00:36.690
with construct. The other thing we've seen a lot in this unit is examples of

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.762
using inheritance. This was the main topic of the previous unit. I'd encourage

00:00:40.762 --> 00:00:44.290
you to think about all the places we've used inheritance in this unit to make

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.168
things work well, especially the inheritance hierarchy for exceptions. I want to

00:00:48.168 --> 00:00:51.268
thank you for taking the class and all the effort that you've put in to get to

00:00:51.268 --> 00:00:54.682
this point. You've really learned a lot. I don't think Google is scared of you

00:00:54.682 --> 00:00:58.192
yet, but you're well on your way to becoming a computer scientist, as well as to

00:00:58.192 --> 00:01:02.510
becoming a proficient Pythonista. There's lots of things you can do from here,

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.397
and there'll be more discussion about this in the forms. You definitely know

00:01:05.397 --> 00:01:08.340
enough to make your own interesting programs and unleash them all on the world.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.142
And I hope many of you will do that. If you do, I hope you will share it with

00:01:12.142 --> 00:01:15.737
us, and there's a site for sharing udacisous projects. Some of the examples

00:01:15.737 --> 00:01:19.690
there might give you some inspiration about things you might build. There is, of

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.372
course, a lot more to learn. And if you learn more, you'll be able to do more

00:01:23.372 --> 00:01:27.193
interesting things in better ways. And I learn new things about computing every

00:01:27.193 --> 00:01:30.785
day. I hope you'll continue to learn more after this class, and I hope you'll go

00:01:30.785 --> 00:01:34.510
on to do exciting and interesting things. Stay Udacious.
