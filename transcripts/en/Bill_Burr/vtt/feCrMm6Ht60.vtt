1
00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.590
Do what the fuck happened to the guy who did the subway things?

2
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.060
Jared says he finds middle school girls hot.

3
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.680
Some chick was taping them for fucking four years. He's caused a lot of pain.

4
00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:19.350
It's pain that will never go away. Well for saying that. Yeah,

5
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.780
you must've gone a little further than that. On Wednesday,

6
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.260
Fogel admitted that he had sex with at least two minors and obtained child

7
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.980
pornography of 12 other children as young as six years old.

8
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.450
A boy. Dude, is anybody safe?

9
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.140
Can anybody go wire to wire without the fucking hammer coming down?

10
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.790
Jared Fogle is a monster. He's a monster. That's what she said.

11
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.220
How funny is it that I was just talking to you guys about eating right and

12
00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:57.070
getting in shape and I go look at Google fucking news.

13
00:00:57.071 --> 00:00:59.440
So I got some that run my Goddamn Yap about

14
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.100
Jesus Christ and he looks like Derosa.

15
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.500
That's fucking hilarious. You gotta be fucking kidding me.

16
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.950
Fogo served as subway spokesman for 15 years.

17
00:01:15.951 --> 00:01:19.340
Ever since he first appeared on television claiming that eating the fast food

18
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.260
chains sandwiches and working out helped them lose more than 200 pounds. Place.

19
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.230
He probably lost that money running out the back door when the parents came.

20
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.040
See, this is dumb. I shouldn't be doing this. This guy has not been connected.

21
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.630
Did I have anything? Oh, but he's completely fucked. He better had done it.

22
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.850
I mean, I hope he didn't for kids' sake,

23
00:01:37.851 --> 00:01:41.600
but I mean he's fucked now it's over.

24
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.410
What's he going to go over to? Blimpie [inaudible] hey everybody,

25
00:01:45.411 --> 00:01:48.650
I'm wrongly accused. Accused a child molester.

26
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:50.710
Jared Fogle.

27
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.960
And I'm going to tell you that a Blimpie's makes you even more skinny.

28
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.560
And what the stress is sitting there, a [inaudible], you know,

29
00:01:59.561 --> 00:02:02.830
thinking I was going to go to jail for that Shit and get gang raped because

30
00:02:02.831 --> 00:02:06.070
that's what happened. God, Jared, Jared, what did you do?

31
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.600
Oh my God, if he, if he fucking did this shit and he's guilty, he goes to jail.

32
00:02:11.601 --> 00:02:14.040
Do you have any fucking idea what's going on?

33
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.060
I love that they put them in protective custody for how fucking long.

34
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.400
You know what I mean? I figured maybe eight, 10 years. He's fucked.

35
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.820
Literally. Oh my God. They'll descend on it, mate. Jeremy,

36
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.370
do you want the six of the 12 inch? God,

37
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.320
I'm fucking kill myself.

38
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:35.190
<v 1>Okay.</v>

39
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.900
<v 0>Oh, there's gotta be a way to do it. Pays to fucking skinny now to hang himself.</v>

40
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.340
Just sit there twitching around like a fucking God damn fly.

41
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.690
They got its wing ripped off.

42
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.300
How do you kill yourself when you're shaped like a pencil? Oh God.

43
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.630
What do you do? Oh, I know I do. I'd fucking break my glasses and I jam.

44
00:02:54.631 --> 00:02:58.580
One of the pieces in my neck just bleed out in the cell. Here you go.

45
00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:59.500
They see there's a way.

46
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.440
You know that you put somebody in a confined area that they're going to come up

47
00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:05.830
with something. You gotta be fucking kidding me.

48
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.680
I don't understand why before the guys convicted that his face is all over the

49
00:03:13.681 --> 00:03:14.514
fucking place.

50
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.330
I don't get it because if this guy didn't do this shit, it was like,

51
00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:22.120
what the fuck I was talking about last week about the hockey player there.

52
00:03:22.121 --> 00:03:24.250
It's like if they didn't do it, they're completely fucked.

53
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.721
They're fucked either way.

54
00:03:25.721 --> 00:03:28.090
Either they did it and they go into jail and they getting gang raped.

55
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.910
You know what? You know let's what you get for doing that shit.

56
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.520
But on the other side, if you didn't do whatever you,

57
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.260
you know what do, what are you doing? How do you make your money then?

58
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.840
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

59
00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.090
<v 0>I dunno. You gotta be fucking kidding me. Wow.</v>

60
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.850
<v 2>Okay.</v>

61
00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.530
<v 0>Jeb Bush. Donald Trump on apologetic for anchor baby language. I gotta.</v>

62
00:03:51.531 --> 00:03:54.470
I gotta be honest with you as far as like, you know, offensive shit.

63
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.230
Anchor baby. That's good. It's pretty fucking light. You know what I mean?

64
00:03:57.231 --> 00:04:01.910
There's no racial epitaphs there. There's nothing homophobic anchor baby.

65
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.630
It's the baby that gets you in here. You know, you put down roots, right?

66
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.150
I've about a root baby. A root. A baby.

67
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.980
Hate that fucking report there. Turn your, turn your face. Shut the fuck up.

68
00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.740
You're offensive. You fucking can't.

69
00:04:18.741 --> 00:04:22.550
You work for some corporate God Damn News News fucking paper.

70
00:04:22.551 --> 00:04:25.100
Quit acting like you're giving out the facts. You jerk off,

71
00:04:25.101 --> 00:04:27.170
you write about what they tell you to write about.

72
00:04:27.171 --> 00:04:28.004
That's what you should have done.

73
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.940
You what they tell you right about then you go on your cash,

74
00:04:31.941 --> 00:04:36.500
those checks down yet and you got to go buy yourself an Audi, right? Or a BMW,

75
00:04:36.501 --> 00:04:40.220
some German sedan that lets the broads know you fucking,

76
00:04:40.221 --> 00:04:43.430
you know you're on the dull. Um,

77
00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.910
you gotta be fucking kidding me, man. Jesus Christ.

78
00:04:46.911 --> 00:04:51.440
If you can't trust a form of fuck fat fuckers eating sandwiches to be around

79
00:04:51.441 --> 00:04:53.330
your kids, honestly, who can you trust?

80
00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.520
That would have been a great fucking segue to go into a my advertising with a

81
00:04:58.521 --> 00:05:02.210
fuck. Is it? Oh, it's over here. That Jesus,

82
00:05:02.211 --> 00:05:04.700
everything's just falling apart on me here. All right. I,

83
00:05:04.701 --> 00:05:06.410
it's time for some advertising. I mean, what else?

84
00:05:06.411 --> 00:05:08.540
What else do you do after you talk about the form of fat?

85
00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:13.070
Fuck who became a skinny guy and then a allegedly

86
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.430
Jesus Christ. I get why anyways, I don't fuck you.

87
00:05:19.431 --> 00:05:23.690
Think you're going to get away with something like that. Um, all right.

88
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.650
We want thing. If you were the spokesperson for Wendy's, like that old guy,

89
00:05:27.651 --> 00:05:30.180
then he could just say, Nah, I was just dressed as Santa.
