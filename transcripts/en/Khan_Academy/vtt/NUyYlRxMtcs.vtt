00:00:00.551 --> 00:00:03.175
- [Voiceover] I have two water
molecules right over here,

00:00:03.175 --> 00:00:04.858
and typically the water molecules, as they

00:00:04.858 --> 00:00:08.121
interact with each other,
they form these hydrogen bonds

00:00:08.121 --> 00:00:10.118
that's due to the polarity
of the water molecule.

00:00:10.118 --> 00:00:12.347
We've talked a lot about that, they slide

00:00:12.347 --> 00:00:14.146
past each other, these
hydrogen bonds give them

00:00:14.146 --> 00:00:16.526
all these neat properties of water.

00:00:16.526 --> 00:00:19.348
But chemistry is much
messier, than sometimes

00:00:19.348 --> 00:00:21.414
our diagrams or explanations show.

00:00:21.414 --> 00:00:23.121
There's all sorts of crazy interactions.

00:00:23.121 --> 00:00:24.317
All of these things are bumping

00:00:24.317 --> 00:00:26.256
into each other in all different ways.

00:00:26.256 --> 00:00:27.718
And not only are the molecules bumping

00:00:27.718 --> 00:00:29.425
in different ways, but any given moment,

00:00:29.425 --> 00:00:31.979
the electrons are jumping around and,

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:34.278
on average, they might spend more time,

00:00:34.278 --> 00:00:36.728
they might spend more
time around the oxygen

00:00:36.728 --> 00:00:39.533
forming a partially
negative charge at that end,

00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:41.758
and then a partially positive charge near

00:00:41.758 --> 00:00:44.219
the hydrogens, because the
hydrogens are having their

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.089
electrons hogged away from them.

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:48.689
In fact this is what
forms the hydrogen bonds.

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:51.150
But there's always
constantly change there.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.451
Because they're all just jumping around.

00:00:52.451 --> 00:00:54.784
It's all very probabilistic.

00:00:54.784 --> 00:00:57.513
And so you can imagine, under
just the right conditions,

00:00:57.513 --> 00:01:01.925
one oxygen or one water
molecule, might just

00:01:01.925 --> 00:01:04.688
graze this water molecule
in the right way,

00:01:04.688 --> 00:01:08.449
that these electrons,
that these electrons,

00:01:08.449 --> 00:01:13.449
get close enough to nab,
to nab this hydrogen.

00:01:13.523 --> 00:01:15.857
But it doesn't nab the entire hydrogen.

00:01:15.857 --> 00:01:18.492
It doesn't nab the
nucleus and the electron,

00:01:18.492 --> 00:01:21.240
and a typical hydrogen atom,
a typical hydrogen atom,

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.424
actually let me draw it.

00:01:22.424 --> 00:01:26.116
A typical hydrogen atom is just a proton,

00:01:26.116 --> 00:01:27.892
is just a proton in the nucleus.

00:01:27.892 --> 00:01:30.040
Actually the most typical
isotope of hydrogen

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.488
has no neutron, so it's just
a proton in the nucleus.

00:01:33.488 --> 00:01:36.054
And an electron orbiting around it.

00:01:36.054 --> 00:01:38.411
So this right over here is positive,

00:01:38.411 --> 00:01:39.990
actually maybe I'll draw it that way,

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.474
you have a positive
proton, and then you have

00:01:42.474 --> 00:01:45.957
a negative electron, you
have a negative electron

00:01:45.957 --> 00:01:46.654
orbiting around it.

00:01:46.654 --> 00:01:48.720
Actually it's more of a orbital.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.493
So it's really this electron
is jumping all around it.

00:01:51.507 --> 00:01:53.687
But you could imagine,
these electrons in this

00:01:53.687 --> 00:01:56.079
covalent bond, they were already being,

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:57.983
these we already being hogged,

00:01:57.983 --> 00:02:00.259
these were already being
hogged by this oxygen,

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:01.617
in fact that's what was forming this

00:02:01.617 --> 00:02:03.347
partial negative charge over here,

00:02:03.347 --> 00:02:05.947
and the partial positive charge over here.

00:02:05.947 --> 00:02:07.387
So these would be attracted to this

00:02:07.387 --> 00:02:08.687
partial positive charge.

00:02:08.687 --> 00:02:10.150
Remember there, you
have a partial negative

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.220
charge over here, this is
actually what's forming

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.416
the hydrogen bond.

00:02:13.416 --> 00:02:16.620
And it actually could bond
to the hydrogen proton,

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.756
while both of these
electrons, including one

00:02:18.756 --> 00:02:20.324
of these electrons that used to be part of

00:02:20.324 --> 00:02:21.519
this hydrogen, or you could consider

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.052
used to be part of that hydrogen,

00:02:23.052 --> 00:02:27.162
are nabbed, are nabbed by this oxygen.

00:02:27.162 --> 00:02:28.857
And in this circumstance,
and I'm not saying

00:02:28.857 --> 00:02:30.285
that this happens all the time,

00:02:30.285 --> 00:02:32.189
but under just the right conditions, this

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:35.161
actually can happen,
and what would result,

00:02:35.161 --> 00:02:38.749
so let me, what result is, this thing

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:41.187
over here, instead of just being a neutral

00:02:41.187 --> 00:02:43.985
water molecule, would look like this.

00:02:43.985 --> 00:02:46.516
So you have your oxygen, you have,

00:02:46.516 --> 00:02:48.396
not only your two hydrogens now,

00:02:48.396 --> 00:02:50.619
you now have a third hydrogen.

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:52.906
You now have a third hydrogen.

00:02:52.906 --> 00:02:55.321
So you have theses two covalent bonds,

00:02:55.321 --> 00:02:58.618
these two covalent bonds, this lone pair.

00:02:58.618 --> 00:03:01.521
And now this lone pair,
which I have circled in blue,

00:03:01.521 --> 00:03:05.178
is now being shared with
this hydrogen proton.

00:03:05.178 --> 00:03:06.687
This electron right over
here of the hydrogen

00:03:06.687 --> 00:03:08.615
got nabbed by this oxygen.

00:03:08.615 --> 00:03:11.053
So now you've formed
another covalent bond.

00:03:11.053 --> 00:03:12.945
And now this character over here,

00:03:12.945 --> 00:03:15.047
he's lost the hydrogen proton, but he's

00:03:15.047 --> 00:03:16.985
kept all of the electrons.

00:03:16.985 --> 00:03:19.424
So this character over
here's gonna look like this.

00:03:19.424 --> 00:03:21.646
You're gonna have your oxygen,

00:03:21.646 --> 00:03:24.345
and now it's only going to only be bonded

00:03:24.345 --> 00:03:28.919
to one hydrogen, only
bonded to one hydrogen.

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:31.694
Has these two original lone pairs.

00:03:31.694 --> 00:03:34.318
These two original lone
pairs right over here.

00:03:34.318 --> 00:03:36.419
And then took both of the electrons

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:38.579
from this covalent bond.

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.191
And took both of the electrons
from this covalent bond.

00:03:41.191 --> 00:03:43.095
And so it has another lone pair.

00:03:43.095 --> 00:03:45.858
So this molecule gained just a proton

00:03:45.858 --> 00:03:47.623
without getting any electrons.

00:03:47.623 --> 00:03:49.260
So if you do that, you're
now going to have a

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.826
net positive charge
for this one over here.

00:03:51.826 --> 00:03:54.484
And this molecule over
here, actually let me,

00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:56.818
let me, ugh, let me just write it.

00:03:56.818 --> 00:03:58.083
I wanna write it a little bit neater.

00:03:58.083 --> 00:03:59.953
And this molecule over here, so we have

00:03:59.953 --> 00:04:03.154
this molecule plus this one, this one

00:04:03.154 --> 00:04:05.953
lost a proton, without any other changes.

00:04:05.953 --> 00:04:08.693
So it now has a negative charge.

00:04:08.693 --> 00:04:10.865
So just like that, you
went from two neutral

00:04:10.865 --> 00:04:13.791
water molecules, to two ions.

00:04:13.791 --> 00:04:15.323
And these ions, this one over here,

00:04:15.323 --> 00:04:17.053
the one on the left, the one that is now

00:04:17.053 --> 00:04:22.053
H three O, H three O, H three O,

00:04:23.253 --> 00:04:26.387
and it now has a positive charge,

00:04:26.387 --> 00:04:28.791
positive charge, actually I put that O

00:04:28.791 --> 00:04:30.056
in a different color.

00:04:30.056 --> 00:04:34.155
H three, H three O.

00:04:34.155 --> 00:04:38.125
It's a positive charge, this
is called the "hydronium ion."

00:04:38.125 --> 00:04:42.328
Hydronium, hydronium.

00:04:42.328 --> 00:04:47.053
And this one over here, that is OH minus,

00:04:47.053 --> 00:04:52.053
so it's OH, O, let me
get the colors right.

00:04:53.056 --> 00:04:57.642
OH minus.

00:04:57.642 --> 00:04:59.650
This is called the
"hydroxide ion," or since

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.994
it's negative you can
just call it an "anion."

00:05:01.994 --> 00:05:06.847
I'll just write "hydroxide," hydroxide,

00:05:06.847 --> 00:05:09.390
hydroxide ion right over there.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.012
So you have this water
and it's just kind of

00:05:11.012 --> 00:05:12.789
automatically under the
right circumstances,

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:14.658
this isn't happening a lot, but under the

00:05:14.658 --> 00:05:17.444
right circumstances, you could have one

00:05:17.444 --> 00:05:19.081
of the water molecules nabbing just

00:05:19.081 --> 00:05:21.624
the hydrogen proton, from
another water molecule.

00:05:21.624 --> 00:05:23.760
And that water molecule
is gonna keep both of the

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.873
electrons, and then they ionize.

00:05:25.873 --> 00:05:28.218
They have autoionized,
and this phenomenon,

00:05:28.218 --> 00:05:31.539
this is called "the
autoionization of water."

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:33.989
Let me write that down,
it's a nice big word.

00:05:33.989 --> 00:05:37.506
Autoionization.

00:05:37.506 --> 00:05:41.988
Autoionization of, of water.

00:05:41.988 --> 00:05:43.927
And I really want to make
it clear what happens.

00:05:43.927 --> 00:05:46.260
This hydrogen over here,
that you can imagine

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.547
at first was a proton and an electron,

00:05:48.547 --> 00:05:49.958
the typical isotope of hydrogen actually

00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.455
does not have a neutron.

00:05:51.455 --> 00:05:54.218
But then this electron got swiped.

00:05:54.218 --> 00:05:57.620
This electron, this electron
was part of this bond

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.280
and it gets swiped away, and so all you're

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.649
left is with this proton, and this proton

00:06:01.649 --> 00:06:03.623
goes to this other water molecule,

00:06:03.623 --> 00:06:06.153
giving that a positive charge.

00:06:06.153 --> 00:06:08.325
And so you might say,
"Well how frequently would

00:06:08.325 --> 00:06:11.750
"I find hydronium ions in water?"

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.851
Well the concentration,
let me actually draw

00:06:13.851 --> 00:06:15.349
a little tub of water
here, let's say this is a

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:16.811
liter of water.

00:06:16.811 --> 00:06:21.781
This is a liter, this is a liter of water.

00:06:21.781 --> 00:06:25.751
The concentration of
hydronium in typical water,

00:06:25.751 --> 00:06:28.816
the concentration of H three O,

00:06:28.816 --> 00:06:31.219
the concentration of H
three O in typical water,

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:32.520
and you put brackets around something

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.215
to denote "concentration," is

00:06:34.215 --> 00:06:38.360
one times ten to the negative seven molar.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.426
And molar, this just
means "moles per liter."

00:06:40.426 --> 00:06:41.181
This is the same thing as

00:06:41.181 --> 00:06:45.186
one times ten to the negative seven moles,

00:06:45.186 --> 00:06:47.090
moles per liter.

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:48.925
And now you might be saying,
"Well, what's a mole?"

00:06:48.925 --> 00:06:50.225
Well I encourage you to watch the video on

00:06:50.225 --> 00:06:51.850
what a mole is, but a mole is a quantity.

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:53.180
It's like saying, "a dozen."

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.620
But it's a much larger, a dozen is equal

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:55.792
to 12 of something.

00:06:55.792 --> 00:06:58.553
A mole is roughly equal
to, let me write it.

00:06:58.553 --> 00:07:00.956
A mole is approximately equal to

00:07:00.956 --> 00:07:04.358
6.02 times ten to the 23rd.

00:07:04.358 --> 00:07:07.458
Ten to the 23rd of something.

00:07:07.458 --> 00:07:09.246
And you're typically
talking about molecules.

00:07:09.246 --> 00:07:13.288
A mole of a substance means approximately

00:07:13.288 --> 00:07:15.587
6.022, it actually keeps going, times

00:07:15.587 --> 00:07:19.024
ten to the 23rd molecules of that thing.

00:07:19.024 --> 00:07:21.403
So you might say, "Hey, one
times ten to the negative seven

00:07:21.403 --> 00:07:23.793
"times 6.02 times ten to the 23rd,

00:07:23.793 --> 00:07:27.021
"that would still get
us," well let's see, this,

00:07:27.021 --> 00:07:27.950
let me actually, let me write it down.

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:30.318
One times ten to the negative seven

00:07:30.318 --> 00:07:35.308
moles per liter, times,

00:07:35.308 --> 00:07:37.978
times, I'll do it this way.

00:07:37.978 --> 00:07:40.721
Times six, I'll just go
with six, since we're

00:07:40.721 --> 00:07:42.114
gonna go approximately.

00:07:42.114 --> 00:07:47.114
So approximately, six
times ten to the 23rd.

00:07:48.479 --> 00:07:53.479
Six times 23rd molecules,
molecules per mole.

00:07:53.959 --> 00:07:56.014
Molecules per mole, well these two would

00:07:56.014 --> 00:07:58.452
cancel out, and you would
multiply these two numbers,

00:07:58.452 --> 00:08:01.053
you would get six times, let's see.

00:08:01.053 --> 00:08:03.560
Ten to the negtive seven
times ten to the 23rd,

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.184
that's still gonna be
ten to the 16th power,

00:08:06.184 --> 00:08:08.158
molecules per liter.

00:08:08.158 --> 00:08:11.153
Molecules per liter, so
your first reaction is,

00:08:11.153 --> 00:08:12.256
"Oh my God!"

00:08:12.256 --> 00:08:14.845
"I'm gonna have six times,"
or roughly, I'll say roughly.

00:08:14.845 --> 00:08:17.423
"Approximately six times ten to the 16th

00:08:17.423 --> 00:08:18.990
"molecules of hydronium in this?"

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.022
"That's a lot, we should
see it all the time."

00:08:21.022 --> 00:08:22.461
But we have to remind ourselves.

00:08:22.461 --> 00:08:26.188
There's just a lot of molecules
of water in there as well.

00:08:26.188 --> 00:08:29.253
In fact, a liter of water is roughly,

00:08:29.253 --> 00:08:34.253
so one liter of H two O, contains,

00:08:34.884 --> 00:08:39.884
contains approximately 56,

00:08:39.888 --> 00:08:44.888
56 moles, moles of H two O.

00:08:46.587 --> 00:08:48.212
So one way to think about it is,

00:08:48.212 --> 00:08:50.523
"I have one, I have one times," and if I'm

00:08:50.523 --> 00:08:52.055
thinking about a liter of water,

00:08:52.055 --> 00:08:53.890
I have, I'll do it over here,

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:57.483
"I have one times ten
to the negative seven

00:08:57.483 --> 00:09:02.483
"moles of, moles of H three O for every,

00:09:05.018 --> 00:09:10.018
"for every 56 moles, for every 56 moles,

00:09:11.461 --> 00:09:14.306
"moles of H two O."

00:09:14.306 --> 00:09:16.616
So if you look at this ratio,
then you start to appreciate.

00:09:16.616 --> 00:09:19.495
The ratio of one times ten
to the negative seven to 56.

00:09:19.495 --> 00:09:21.190
Let me do it down here.

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:22.920
So this is the same thing as,

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:27.460
one times ten to the negative seven to 56,

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:29.886
is the same thing as,
let's just multiply both

00:09:29.886 --> 00:09:32.882
side times, or the numerator
and the denominator,

00:09:32.882 --> 00:09:34.716
times ten to the seventh.

00:09:34.716 --> 00:09:38.988
So if we do that, this
is the same thing as one,

00:09:38.988 --> 00:09:43.988
one, the ratio of
hydronium to regular water,

00:09:44.074 --> 00:09:47.255
to H two O is gonna be one
to, let's see if I multiply

00:09:47.255 --> 00:09:49.960
56, times ten to the
seventh, I'm gonna have

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:53.083
five, let me get, write
in that same color.

00:09:53.083 --> 00:09:56.554
I'm gonna have five six,
then I'm gonna have,

00:09:56.554 --> 00:09:58.853
I'm gonna throw seven
zeros at the end of it.

00:09:58.853 --> 00:09:59.991
Let me do that.

00:09:59.991 --> 00:10:03.660
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:07.491
So the ratio of hydronium
to regular H two O

00:10:07.491 --> 00:10:10.719
is one for ever five
hundred and sixty million.

00:10:10.719 --> 00:10:12.518
So even though you might
say, "Oh wow, look."

00:10:12.518 --> 00:10:15.421
"We're gonna have a
huge number of molecules

00:10:15.421 --> 00:10:17.754
"of hydronium in this liter of water."

00:10:17.754 --> 00:10:20.444
For every one of them, you actually have

00:10:20.444 --> 00:10:25.444
roughly five hundred sixty
million molecules of H two O.

00:10:25.852 --> 00:10:28.917
So that should give you
an appreciation for the

00:10:28.917 --> 00:10:31.286
fact that this isn't that typical.

00:10:31.286 --> 00:10:33.341
In fact, you're gonna
see this much more often

00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:34.653
than you see this over here.

00:10:34.653 --> 00:10:37.393
In fact, if you wanted
to make these arrows

00:10:37.393 --> 00:10:40.458
kind of show which direction
the equilibrium sits in,

00:10:40.458 --> 00:10:43.140
it's actually much further,
it's actually much further

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:43.755
to the left.

00:10:43.755 --> 00:10:45.659
So we could make this arrow much bigger.

00:10:45.659 --> 00:10:46.855
But it also gives you an appreciation

00:10:46.855 --> 00:10:49.084
for just how many
molecules you have sitting

00:10:49.084 --> 00:10:53.107
in a liter, in a liter of water.
