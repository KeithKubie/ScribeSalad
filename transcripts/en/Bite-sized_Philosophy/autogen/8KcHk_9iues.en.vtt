hello dr. Peterson I've been trying to
 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.450
hello dr. Peterson I've been trying to
listen to my conscience but I can't tell

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460
listen to my conscience but I can't tell
 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.550
listen to my conscience but I can't tell
the difference between fear willful

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560
the difference between fear willful
 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.430
the difference between fear willful
blindness or genuine conscience well the

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440
blindness or genuine conscience well the
 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.020
blindness or genuine conscience well the
first thing I would say about that is it

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030
first thing I would say about that is it
 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.730
first thing I would say about that is it
is quite clear that you are in fact

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740
is quite clear that you are in fact
 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.140
is quite clear that you are in fact
trying to listen to your conscience

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150
trying to listen to your conscience
 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.849
trying to listen to your conscience
because that's probably the first thing

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859
because that's probably the first thing
 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.950
because that's probably the first thing
that you discover so that's a really

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960
that you discover so that's a really
 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.310
that you discover so that's a really
good question okay

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320
 
 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.000
 
fear well here's a test and you don't

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010
fear well here's a test and you don't
 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.740
fear well here's a test and you don't
want to do this stupidly if you think

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750
want to do this stupidly if you think
 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.260
want to do this stupidly if you think
that you should do something and you

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270
that you should do something and you
 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.180
that you should do something and you
think that the reason you might not be

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190
think that the reason you might not be
 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.490
think that the reason you might not be
doing it is because you're afraid then

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500
doing it is because you're afraid then
 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.060
doing it is because you're afraid then
you should do it so that way you can

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070
you should do it so that way you can
 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.720
you should do it so that way you can
find out if it's fear you know I think

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730
find out if it's fear you know I think
 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.430
find out if it's fear you know I think
your question is will hi do I know my

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440
your question is will hi do I know my
 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.290
your question is will hi do I know my
conscience isn't just masquerading as

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300
conscience isn't just masquerading as
 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.729
conscience isn't just masquerading as
fear saying well you shouldn't do that

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739
fear saying well you shouldn't do that
 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.580
fear saying well you shouldn't do that
but it's rationalizing the real issue

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590
but it's rationalizing the real issue
 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.110
but it's rationalizing the real issue
which is you're afraid of doing that

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120
which is you're afraid of doing that
 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.220
which is you're afraid of doing that
yeah see here's a reason that you want

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230
yeah see here's a reason that you want
 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.619
yeah see here's a reason that you want
to tell the truth and I part I kind of

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629
to tell the truth and I part I kind of
 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:04.700
to tell the truth and I part I kind of
figured this out when I was looking

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710
figured this out when I was looking
 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.830
figured this out when I was looking
deeply into the Pinocchio story you know

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840
deeply into the Pinocchio story you know
 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.920
deeply into the Pinocchio story you know
in Pinocchio as Pinocchio strives to

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930
in Pinocchio as Pinocchio strives to
 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.440
in Pinocchio as Pinocchio strives to
become real he he has a conscience to

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450
become real he he has a conscience to
 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.359
become real he he has a conscience to
guide him but it's Jiminy Cricket this

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369
guide him but it's Jiminy Cricket this
 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.850
guide him but it's Jiminy Cricket this
insect but jiminy isn't really a very

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860
insect but jiminy isn't really a very
 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.740
insect but jiminy isn't really a very
good conscience he's a bit dogmatic to

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750
good conscience he's a bit dogmatic to
 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.420
good conscience he's a bit dogmatic to
begin with dogmatic and inexperienced

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430
begin with dogmatic and inexperienced
 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.770
begin with dogmatic and inexperienced
and so it's it's not like the conscience

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780
and so it's it's not like the conscience
 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.130
and so it's it's not like the conscience
is an unerring guide it's like a partner

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140
is an unerring guide it's like a partner
 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.929
is an unerring guide it's like a partner
in discovery and as you move forward in

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939
in discovery and as you move forward in
 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.219
in discovery and as you move forward in
your life and you consult your

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229
your life and you consult your
 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.910
your life and you consult your
conscience and you listen to it then it

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920
conscience and you listen to it then it
 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.940
conscience and you listen to it then it
gets smarter and so do you but there's a

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950
gets smarter and so do you but there's a
 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.270
gets smarter and so do you but there's a
coda there and this is why I've

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280
coda there and this is why I've
 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.530
coda there and this is why I've
suggested part of the reason why I've

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540
suggested part of the reason why I've
 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.600
suggested part of the reason why I've
suggested so frequently in my lectures

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610
suggested so frequently in my lectures
 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.539
suggested so frequently in my lectures
and in my book that people try not to

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549
and in my book that people try not to
 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.810
and in my book that people try not to
lie you see there are many systems you

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820
lie you see there are many systems you
 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.300
lie you see there are many systems you
have many systems within let's say that

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310
have many systems within let's say that
 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.840
have many systems within let's say that
guide you and what one of those is your

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850
guide you and what one of those is your
 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.370
guide you and what one of those is your
capacity for rational thought and then

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380
capacity for rational thought and then
 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.139
capacity for rational thought and then
you have a variety of emotional systems

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149
you have a variety of emotional systems
 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.330
you have a variety of emotional systems
and motivational systems and internal

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340
and motivational systems and internal
 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.809
and motivational systems and internal
dramas and intuitions and bodily

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819
dramas and intuitions and bodily
 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.969
dramas and intuitions and bodily
sensations like lots and lots of and

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979
sensations like lots and lots of and
 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.490
sensations like lots and lots of and
senses lots of systems that are guiding

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500
senses lots of systems that are guiding
 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.270
senses lots of systems that are guiding
you

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280
you
 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.180
you
and many of them operate you might say

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190
and many of them operate you might say
 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.590
and many of them operate you might say
unconsciously autonomously instinctively

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600
unconsciously autonomously instinctively
 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.440
unconsciously autonomously instinctively
implicitly all of that now you

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450
implicitly all of that now you
 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.230
implicitly all of that now you
nonetheless you program them like you

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240
nonetheless you program them like you
 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.840
nonetheless you program them like you
feed them content let's say just like

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850
feed them content let's say just like
 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.490
feed them content let's say just like
you feed your body nourishment you feed

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500
you feed your body nourishment you feed
 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.130
you feed your body nourishment you feed
them content and a lot of the content

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140
them content and a lot of the content
 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.979
them content and a lot of the content
that you feed them pertains directly to

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989
that you feed them pertains directly to
 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.350
that you feed them pertains directly to
your voluntary thoughts and speech and

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360
your voluntary thoughts and speech and
 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.809
your voluntary thoughts and speech and
your actions and then if you pathologies

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819
your actions and then if you pathologies
 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.509
your actions and then if you pathologies
those by lying so if you say things that

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519
those by lying so if you say things that
 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.430
those by lying so if you say things that
you know not to be true or you don't say

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440
you know not to be true or you don't say
 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.990
you know not to be true or you don't say
things that you know to be true when you

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000
things that you know to be true when you
 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.080
things that you know to be true when you
need to which is more common and if you

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090
need to which is more common and if you
 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.930
need to which is more common and if you
act in ways that you consider that in

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940
act in ways that you consider that in
 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.430
act in ways that you consider that in
fact act in ways you consider

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440
fact act in ways you consider
 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.970
fact act in ways you consider
reprehensible then you pathologize all

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980
reprehensible then you pathologize all
 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.130
reprehensible then you pathologize all
of those autonomous systems that guide

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140
of those autonomous systems that guide
 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.690
of those autonomous systems that guide
you it's like you're programming them

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700
you it's like you're programming them
 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.070
you it's like you're programming them
badly you're building an AI system

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080
badly you're building an AI system
 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.130
badly you're building an AI system
inside yourself really and in some sense

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140
inside yourself really and in some sense
 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.800
inside yourself really and in some sense
that is what you're doing that has very

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810
that is what you're doing that has very
 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.470
that is what you're doing that has very
bad it's very bad training data and so

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480
bad it's very bad training data and so
 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.540
bad it's very bad training data and so
the output it produces will be will

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550
the output it produces will be will
 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.420
the output it produces will be will
won't guide you properly and so you

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430
won't guide you properly and so you
 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.110
won't guide you properly and so you
don't want to pathologies your guidance

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120
don't want to pathologies your guidance
 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.289
don't want to pathologies your guidance
systems it's a really bad idea so that's

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299
systems it's a really bad idea so that's
 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.020
systems it's a really bad idea so that's
why you have to not lie and maybe that's

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030
why you have to not lie and maybe that's
 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.759
why you have to not lie and maybe that's
also why you have to say what you have

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769
also why you have to say what you have
 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.920
also why you have to say what you have
to say and you have to say it clearly as

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930
to say and you have to say it clearly as
 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.030
to say and you have to say it clearly as
well and you have to learn how to do

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040
well and you have to learn how to do
 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.500
well and you have to learn how to do
that

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510
that
 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.180
that
so that's one of the ways of getting

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190
so that's one of the ways of getting
 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.830
so that's one of the ways of getting
your conscience straightened out and

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840
your conscience straightened out and
 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.509
your conscience straightened out and
then you have to have a dialogue with

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519
then you have to have a dialogue with
 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.190
then you have to have a dialogue with
your conscience and you might ask it's

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200
your conscience and you might ask it's
 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.020
your conscience and you might ask it's
like okay well what should I do

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030
like okay well what should I do
 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.120
like okay well what should I do
or what should should I do this or

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130
or what should should I do this or
 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.979
or what should should I do this or
should I not do this so let's say you're

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989
should I not do this so let's say you're
 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.509
should I not do this so let's say you're
thinking should I not do this in the

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519
thinking should I not do this in the
 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.539
thinking should I not do this in the
case of a temptation maybe you have a

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549
case of a temptation maybe you have a
 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:56.030
case of a temptation maybe you have a
chance to develop a new relationship you

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040
chance to develop a new relationship you
 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.580
chance to develop a new relationship you
know and you're you're excited about it

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590
know and you're you're excited about it
 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.680
know and you're you're excited about it
and apprehensive about it and afraid of

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690
and apprehensive about it and afraid of
 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.860
and apprehensive about it and afraid of
it and you don't know how to sort out

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870
it and you don't know how to sort out
 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.199
it and you don't know how to sort out
all those feelings and the first thing

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209
all those feelings and the first thing
 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.970
all those feelings and the first thing
is you really have to want to sort them

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980
is you really have to want to sort them
 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.050
is you really have to want to sort them
out that's why you have to orient

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060
out that's why you have to orient
 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.390
out that's why you have to orient
yourself to something that's a genuine

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400
yourself to something that's a genuine
 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.910
yourself to something that's a genuine
up you know that the star above the

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920
up you know that the star above the
 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.150
up you know that the star above the
horizon you have to really want things

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160
horizon you have to really want things
 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.770
horizon you have to really want things
to be straight and you have to have

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780
to be straight and you have to have
 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.360
to be straight and you have to have
thought that through and you have to

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370
thought that through and you have to
 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.089
thought that through and you have to
know what it means for things not to be

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:23.099
know what it means for things not to be
 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:24.560
know what it means for things not to be
straight and really what it means is

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570
straight and really what it means is
 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.210
straight and really what it means is
that you're headed for hell in one way

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220
that you're headed for hell in one way
 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.160
that you're headed for hell in one way
or another and if you underst

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170
or another and if you underst
 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.440
or another and if you underst
it's enough maybe it's enough to scare

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450
it's enough maybe it's enough to scare
 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:31.610
it's enough maybe it's enough to scare
you straight you really got to think

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620
you straight you really got to think
 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.350
you straight you really got to think
that through then you got to think about

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360
that through then you got to think about
 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.910
that through then you got to think about
how much better it would be if you aimed

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920
how much better it would be if you aimed
 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.980
how much better it would be if you aimed
up and that really has to kind of

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990
up and that really has to kind of
 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.530
up and that really has to kind of
permeate your whole being and so then

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540
permeate your whole being and so then
 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.750
permeate your whole being and so then
you're oriented that way you're oriented

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760
you're oriented that way you're oriented
 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.310
you're oriented that way you're oriented
up and you're deciding that it's okay to

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320
up and you're deciding that it's okay to
 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.260
up and you're deciding that it's okay to
try to tell the truth and then you can

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270
try to tell the truth and then you can
 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.120
try to tell the truth and then you can
start to rely on this dialogue with your

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130
start to rely on this dialogue with your
 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.600
start to rely on this dialogue with your
conscience but both of you have to learn

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610
conscience but both of you have to learn
 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.250
conscience but both of you have to learn
and you're gonna make mistakes along the

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260
and you're gonna make mistakes along the
 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.800
and you're gonna make mistakes along the
way you know that's okay you can say

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810
way you know that's okay you can say
 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.180
way you know that's okay you can say
well I'm gonna try this without being

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190
well I'm gonna try this without being
 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.460
well I'm gonna try this without being
certain that it's right you can even say

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470
certain that it's right you can even say
 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.040
certain that it's right you can even say
I'm going to say this without being

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050
I'm going to say this without being
 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.390
I'm going to say this without being
certain that it's correct like if you're

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400
certain that it's correct like if you're
 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.010
certain that it's correct like if you're
arguing with your wife or your husband

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020
arguing with your wife or your husband
 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.500
arguing with your wife or your husband
or your or your sister your father and

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510
or your or your sister your father and
 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.270
or your or your sister your father and
you have an idea about what might be

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280
you have an idea about what might be
 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.680
you have an idea about what might be
going on you can say look here's my idea

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690
going on you can say look here's my idea
 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.220
going on you can say look here's my idea
about what's going on who knows what

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230
about what's going on who knows what
 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:17.840
about what's going on who knows what
that idea might be contaminated with

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850
that idea might be contaminated with
 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.550
that idea might be contaminated with
like maybe I'm putting it forward just

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560
like maybe I'm putting it forward just
 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.320
like maybe I'm putting it forward just
because I'm too proud or arrogant or

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330
because I'm too proud or arrogant or
 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.110
because I'm too proud or arrogant or
angry or fearful or whatever that's

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120
angry or fearful or whatever that's
 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.240
angry or fearful or whatever that's
possible let's see if we can figure that

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250
possible let's see if we can figure that
 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.520
possible let's see if we can figure that
out but you can offer tentatively and

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530
out but you can offer tentatively and
 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.080
out but you can offer tentatively and
both have at it that's what you do if

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090
both have at it that's what you do if
 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.910
both have at it that's what you do if
it's a hypothesis right you both have at

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:34.920
it's a hypothesis right you both have at
 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.830
it's a hypothesis right you both have at
it and see if it's an idea that's worthy

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840
it and see if it's an idea that's worthy
 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.410
it and see if it's an idea that's worthy
of of keeping can you do that with your

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:39.420
of of keeping can you do that with your
 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.990
of of keeping can you do that with your
conscience and then you work move

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000
conscience and then you work move
 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.500
conscience and then you work move
forward there's a technique in

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510
forward there's a technique in
 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.200
forward there's a technique in
behavioral psychology called

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210
behavioral psychology called
 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.070
behavioral psychology called
psychotherapy called collaborative

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080
psychotherapy called collaborative
 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.520
psychotherapy called collaborative
empiricism so let's say that we you and

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530
empiricism so let's say that we you and
 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:53.900
empiricism so let's say that we you and
I have been sitting down and we decide

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910
I have been sitting down and we decide
 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.760
I have been sitting down and we decide
that you're gonna try something new this

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770
that you're gonna try something new this
 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.740
that you're gonna try something new this
week like maybe your Agra phobic and

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750
week like maybe your Agra phobic and
 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.060
week like maybe your Agra phobic and
you're having a hard time in a parking

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.070
you're having a hard time in a parking
 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.400
you're having a hard time in a parking
lot and so getting out of the car and

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.410
lot and so getting out of the car and
 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.050
lot and so getting out of the car and
going to the grocery store so maybe we

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060
going to the grocery store so maybe we
 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.940
going to the grocery store so maybe we
say well you know drive to the grocery

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:04.950
say well you know drive to the grocery
 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.140
say well you know drive to the grocery
store and you're just gonna walk halfway

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150
store and you're just gonna walk halfway
 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.190
store and you're just gonna walk halfway
to the halfway from your car to the door

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.200
to the halfway from your car to the door
 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.140
to the halfway from your car to the door
that's good enough for like do that

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150
that's good enough for like do that
 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.240
that's good enough for like do that
every second day for a week and then

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250
every second day for a week and then
 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:15.710
every second day for a week and then
come back and let's talk about it

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.720
come back and let's talk about it
 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.180
come back and let's talk about it
so that's collaborative empiricism

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190
so that's collaborative empiricism
 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.040
so that's collaborative empiricism
you're running a little experiments you

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050
you're running a little experiments you
 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.020
you're running a little experiments you
think well your conscience is guiding

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030
think well your conscience is guiding
 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:22.580
think well your conscience is guiding
you towards something you take a

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:22.590
you towards something you take a
 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.460
you towards something you take a
tentative step in that direction and

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.470
tentative step in that direction and
 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.470
tentative step in that direction and
then you check and see well you know did

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:27.480
then you check and see well you know did
 

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.830
then you check and see well you know did
what I wanted to have happen occur as an

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840
what I wanted to have happen occur as an
 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.660
what I wanted to have happen occur as an
outcome that's the crucial question

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:32.670
outcome that's the crucial question
 

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:34.520
outcome that's the crucial question
that's the crucial question for

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:34.530
that's the crucial question for
 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:36.020
that's the crucial question for
behavioural truth right that's the

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.030
behavioural truth right that's the
 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:39.140
behavioural truth right that's the
pragmatic perspective did what I want to

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.150
pragmatic perspective did what I want to
 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.600
pragmatic perspective did what I want to
have happened happen as a consequence of

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:41.610
have happened happen as a consequence of
 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:42.020
have happened happen as a consequence of
my

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:42.030
my
 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:43.670
my
framework of interpretation and my

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680
framework of interpretation and my
 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.780
framework of interpretation and my
action if the answer is yes then I have

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:47.790
action if the answer is yes then I have
 

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.390
action if the answer is yes then I have
not invalidate it right that's that's

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400
not invalidate it right that's that's
 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.280
not invalidate it right that's that's
the pragmatic philosophy in a nutshell

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:52.290
the pragmatic philosophy in a nutshell
 

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:59.540
the pragmatic philosophy in a nutshell
and it's it's very very smart so you

00:06:59.540 --> 00:06:59.550
and it's it's very very smart so you
 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.040
and it's it's very very smart so you
have a dialogue with your conscience

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.050
have a dialogue with your conscience
 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:02.540
have a dialogue with your conscience
that never ends and hopefully it gets

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:02.550
that never ends and hopefully it gets
 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:09.500
that never ends and hopefully it gets
wiser and you get wiser and that's the

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:09.510
wiser and you get wiser and that's the
 

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:11.060
wiser and you get wiser and that's the
dialogue that young talked about between

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:11.070
dialogue that young talked about between
 

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:12.490
