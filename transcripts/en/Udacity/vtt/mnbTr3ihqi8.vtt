00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.452
Let's go over a little more detail about Operant Conditioning, before I send

00:00:03.452 --> 00:00:07.651
you over to Susan for a wrap-up on this section in the lesson. So when the

00:00:07.651 --> 00:00:11.014
consequences of our behavior result in something being added to the

00:00:11.014 --> 00:00:15.922
environment. To increase the likelihood of the behavior occurring again in the

00:00:15.922 --> 00:00:20.675
future. This is called a positive reinforcement because we're adding something

00:00:20.675 --> 00:00:25.015
to the environment. On the other hand, when the consequences of our behavior

00:00:25.015 --> 00:00:28.315
result in something being removed from the environment to increase the

00:00:28.315 --> 00:00:33.810
likelihood of the behavior occurring in the future. This is a negative

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.591
reinforcement. Because something is being removed from the environment. Now

00:00:38.591 --> 00:00:42.011
it's important to note here, that both of these are reinforcements, and

00:00:42.011 --> 00:00:47.141
reinforcements increase the likelihood of a behavior. So even though here,

00:00:47.141 --> 00:00:52.382
something is added. And here something is removed. They both increase a

00:00:52.382 --> 00:00:57.290
likelihood of a behavior, but do so using different mechanisms. Now I'll send

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.554
you back to Susan to finish up this section on operant conditioning. Before we

00:01:00.554 --> 00:01:02.119
move on to social learning.
