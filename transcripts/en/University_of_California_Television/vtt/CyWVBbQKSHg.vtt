00:00:04.665 --> 00:00:07.498
(classical music)

00:00:09.128 --> 00:00:11.423
- [Male] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.736
Bipedal, naked, large brain,

00:00:16.736 --> 00:00:20.965
lone the master of
tools, fire and language

00:00:20.965 --> 00:00:24.023
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.192 --> 00:00:27.830
Aware that death is inevitable

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.883
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.683
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.049
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:39.273
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:42.020
We shape the future

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.693
from our shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.160
Carta brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.230
to exchange insights on who we are

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.703
and how we got here.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.960
An exploration made possible

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.713
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:14.622 --> 00:01:17.205
(upbeat music)

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.580
- Thank you for the invitation.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.361
It's been really exciting for me.

00:01:42.361 --> 00:01:44.450
This talk is gonna be about brains

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.820
and I'm not gonna actually talk

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:46.960
about primates or humans

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.050
but I'm gonna come to some
conclusions about humans

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.069
and culture.

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:52.900
So this is the brain of
a bottlenose dolphin,

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.170
the back of the brain
of a bottlenose dolphin

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.770
and this is the brain of a small marsupial

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.870
and you can see the
neocortex is really large

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.793
and I'm gonna talk about
the neocortex today,

00:01:59.793 --> 00:02:02.030
very specifically for a couple of reasons.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.262
One is that it's the part of the brain

00:02:04.262 --> 00:02:08.940
that's changed most dramatically
in mammals over time

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:09.880
and in humans in particular,

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.830
they have an extremely large neocortex.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.210
It's the part of the brain

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.429
that's involved in cognition, language,

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:18.520
and things like tool use.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.353
The question

00:02:19.353 --> 00:02:21.980
that we're interested in
addressing in my laboratory

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.220
is how the brain gets more complex

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.060
or how the neocortex gets more complex.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.450
So we know that early mammals

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.840
had a neocortex that was very, very tiny

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.330
and had a few cortical fields.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.984
And cortical fields are
the functional units

00:02:32.984 --> 00:02:35.340
of the neocortex.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.615
And we know that as brains evolved,

00:02:37.615 --> 00:02:39.110
and particularly primate brains

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.943
the neocortex became

00:02:39.943 --> 00:02:41.963
a really, really enormous cortical sheet

00:02:41.963 --> 00:02:43.650
that now is proposed,

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.130
humans are proposed to have
hundreds of cortical fields.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.820
So the question is how do you get

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.220
from a very, very simple form

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.810
to a very, very complicated form.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.080
But this is a serious problem to address

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.970
because these types of changes,

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:55.990
certainly from early mammals,

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.830
are 200 million years of changes.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.830
And we can even see the sorts of changes

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.230
that have occurred in the human line

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.090
over a six million year period.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.410
So how do you address these changes?

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.230
And there are two ways that you can get

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.992
at this question of evolution.

00:03:09.992 --> 00:03:12.400
You can say what has evolution produced?

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.420
And the way we can understand
what evolution has produced

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.710
is we look at brains and bodies,

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:16.760
we do a comparative approach.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.450
So I can look at a lot of different brains

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.250
using a variety of different techniques,

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.567
electrophysiological, anatomical,

00:03:21.567 --> 00:03:24.635
and I can say, what sorts
of changes have come about?

00:03:24.635 --> 00:03:28.365
The problem is evolution
is a moving picture

00:03:28.365 --> 00:03:31.210
and the life of an individual
is a moving picture.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.860
So any time we study an
individual or a mammal,

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.610
we're taking one snapshot of
that moving picture of life

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.030
and trying to figure it out.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.580
So what we do with a comparative analysis

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.470
is we look at a lot of snapshots

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.541
and try to put this moving
picture back together.

00:03:44.541 --> 00:03:47.670
However, while these sort
of comparative studies

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.520
can tell us what evolution has produced,

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.350
they don't tell us how
phenotypic transformations occur,

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.670
how do I get more cortical fields?

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.390
How do I change connections of a cortex

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.756
which in turn changes behavior?

00:03:56.756 --> 00:03:58.728
And this is where studies of development

00:03:58.728 --> 00:03:59.750
come into play

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.700
because the evolution of any aspect

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:03.925
of the body, the brain,

00:04:03.925 --> 00:04:06.610
is actually the evolution
of developmental mechanisms

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.637
that give rise to that
aspect of the phenotype.

00:04:08.637 --> 00:04:11.170
So my talk is gonna focus a little bit

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.530
on this.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:13.970
So comparative analysis,

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.230
this is many, many years of work.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.570
This is a cladogram

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:17.730
and these are neocortices.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:18.990
And you're gonna see
these sort of cartoons

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:20.290
throughout the talk.

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:21.140
This is the neocortex.

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.770
These red and blue and yellow areas

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.180
indicate cortical fields.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.110
And the most important
thing to take away from this

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.930
is that you can have common ancestors,

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.200
which we don't know about,

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.680
humans, macaque monkeys, cats, squirrels.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.960
There is a constellation
of cortical fields

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:35.987
that all species possess,

00:04:35.987 --> 00:04:37.910
even in the absence of use,

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.070
and this is due to inheritance

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.903
from a common ancestry

00:04:39.903 --> 00:04:41.750
and it's also due to the
way genes are deployed

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:42.640
in development.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.631
But that's gonna be a different story.

00:04:44.631 --> 00:04:47.110
So there are similarities in brains.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.760
My brain is very similar to
a mouse brain in some ways

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:50.890
but it's also very different.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.260
And here are some of
the sorts of differences

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.823
you're gonna see.

00:04:54.823 --> 00:04:55.700
This is a flattened view of the neocortex.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:56.590
This is the front of the brain,

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:57.620
this is the top of the brain.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.900
This is a macaque monkey

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:59.770
and this is a mouse.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:00.760
And they're not drawn to scale.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.593
This would actually,

00:05:01.593 --> 00:05:04.910
this mouse neocortex would
be a little tiny portion

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.147
of the macaque neocortex.

00:05:06.147 --> 00:05:07.380
And what we can see

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.927
is that there are changes in
the size of the cortical sheet,

00:05:09.927 --> 00:05:11.943
there are changes in
cortical field number,

00:05:11.943 --> 00:05:15.020
there are changes in the
relative size of cortical fields.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.940
There are changes in
the connection patterns

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.660
of homologous cortical fields.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.208
And of course the question is

00:05:20.208 --> 00:05:24.280
to what extent are these
differences due to genes

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.050
that are intrinsic to
the developing neocortex?

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.560
Have they changed in species over time?

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.750
And they probably have.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.800
Genes associated with the
development of the body.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.760
Because the body changes,

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.080
we use the body differently

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.747
and you cannot think about the brain

00:05:34.747 --> 00:05:36.210
without thinking about the body.

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.490
There's a middle man there, right?

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:38.685
The brain is not embodied itself.

00:05:38.685 --> 00:05:39.760
It needs the body

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.261
to provide all information
about the world.

00:05:42.261 --> 00:05:44.170
Epigenetic influences.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:47.840
And by this I mean sensory-driven

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.901
or environmental or context-driven changes

00:05:49.901 --> 00:05:52.308
to the brain and the body.

00:05:52.308 --> 00:05:55.440
Or is it some combination
of these factors?

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.600
Is any creature due to
just one sort of thing

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.240
or is it some sort of
combination in different species

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.000
over the course of evolution?

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.293
So I'm gonna give you some examples

00:06:04.293 --> 00:06:05.690
of comparative work

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.280
and changes in peripheral morphology

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.962
that give us some clue

00:06:08.962 --> 00:06:12.240
about what the answer to that question is.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.440
So this is one of my very
favorite examples on the planet.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.840
It's a duck-billed platypus.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.630
This is a real animal, this is the bill

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.240
and what's really cool, yeah

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.150
and the reason I'm also
interested in the body

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.000
is when I started working on
different animals in Australia,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.980
I had to catch every
single animal I worked on

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.270
and it gives you a really,
really great appreciation

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:30.610
for the body and how important it is

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.390
because they're hard to catch.

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:34.190
Anyway, I digress.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:35.990
So what's really cool about the platypus

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.300
is that it has mechanosensory receptors

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.760
that are exquisitely sensitive to touch,

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.660
inter-digits with electrosensory
receptors on its bill,

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.150
and when it does anything important,

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.010
capture prey items, mate,

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.010
it closes its eyes, its ears and its nose.

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:51.130
So all it has is a bill.

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:52.500
And if you look at its neocortex

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.331
using electrophysiological
recording techniques,

00:06:54.331 --> 00:06:56.180
this is the front of the brain,

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.360
this is the top of the brain,

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.930
this is the representation of the bill

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:00.792
on the cortical sheet.

00:07:00.792 --> 00:07:02.610
There are a number of cortical fields.

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:04.921
So within the somatosensory cortex,

00:07:04.921 --> 00:07:07.419
it takes up about 90% of the entire

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:09.640
representation of the
somatosensory cortex.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.180
And if you look at the cortex itself,

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.120
it takes up about 75% of
the entire cortical sheet.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.543
This animal is one big huge bill.

00:07:16.543 --> 00:07:18.520
And it's hard to imagine,

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.180
this is called cortical magnification.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.600
And the question is is this due to genes

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.760
intrinsic to the neocortex

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.870
that have made this
cortex one big huge bill,

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:26.703
changes to the body?

00:07:26.703 --> 00:07:29.250
It has to be to some extent
due to changes in the body.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.459
The environment and how the animal uses

00:07:31.459 --> 00:07:33.910
the body in the environment.

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:36.080
And I gave you the example
of the duck-billed platypus

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.060
because it's an extraordinary example

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.188
of cortical magnification.

00:07:39.188 --> 00:07:41.260
But we must appreciate that we see this

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:42.900
across the board in a lot of species,

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:43.910
including humans.

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:47.420
If you look at the evolution
of the supralaryngeal rack

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:50.040
and the specializations
of this body morphology,

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.760
we have an expanded representation,

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.780
somatosensory cortex, motor
cortex, premotor cortex

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:58.230
of this specialized structure
which we call Broca's Area.

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:00.108
So they are following the same roles

00:08:00.108 --> 00:08:02.293
of evolution as other species.

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.940
I'm gonna switch really rapidly

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.240
to experimental manipulations
of peripheral morphology.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.340
So you say, okay,

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.900
to what extent is the ratio
of incoming sensory inputs

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.741
to the developing neocortex

00:08:14.741 --> 00:08:17.490
determining the functional
organization of the neocortex?

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:18.323
And for this,

00:08:18.323 --> 00:08:19.630
we used little short-tailed opossums.

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:21.142
They are models of early blindness.

00:08:21.142 --> 00:08:22.700
We bilaterally nucleated,

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.870
removed the eyes when
these animals are embryos.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:26.570
So it's basically a little layer of skin.

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:27.560
We let them grow up

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.770
and we look at their connections,

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:31.220
we look at the functional
organization of their brain

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.870
and what we see is that
here's visual cortex

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:34.703
in this animal.

00:08:34.703 --> 00:08:35.536
This is the front of the brain

00:08:35.536 --> 00:08:36.369
and this is the top of the brain.

00:08:36.369 --> 00:08:38.620
And all of what would
normally be visual cortex,

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:39.790
which is in blue here,

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:41.020
is now processing inputs

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.720
from the somatosensory
and auditory system.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.020
So we've totally functionally

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:45.888
changed the reorganization
of this neocortex.

00:08:45.888 --> 00:08:49.010
And if we look at the connections,

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:49.879
these are connections,

00:08:49.879 --> 00:08:52.218
these are visual areas here in blue,

00:08:52.218 --> 00:08:53.377
primary visual cortex

00:08:53.377 --> 00:08:55.800
and it's getting input from
other visual structures.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.800
These are auditory structures in yellow

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.710
and somatosensory structures in red.

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:01.900
And what we see in our bilateral nucleus

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.040
is that now the connections
of the brain have changed.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.650
We've done nothing to
the neocortex itself,

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:06.550
not one thing.

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:08.670
We've simply removed all visual input

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:09.960
really early in development.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.210
And what we see is this
functional takeover

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:14.680
and connectional takeover
of the developing brain.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:18.379
And if we look at what that
region is representing,

00:09:18.379 --> 00:09:20.370
which would normally be visual,

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:22.380
it's representing the head vibracy.

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:23.410
We've basically,

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:25.000
I want to say we've
made a platypus, right?

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.140
So something like 80% of the neocortex

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:29.450
is now processing inputs from this stuff,

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:31.653
from the vibracy and
the snout and the face.

00:09:32.923 --> 00:09:35.908
And of course, it's
great to have a big brain

00:09:35.908 --> 00:09:37.630
and transform the neocortex

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:38.660
but you have to ask yourself

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:39.900
what does this mean for behavior?

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.260
Which is the target of selection.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.360
And so we had train discrimination tasks

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.240
and natural behavior.

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.550
And I wanted to show
you the natural behavior

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:46.750
'cause it's really cool.

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:48.526
These animals,

00:09:48.526 --> 00:09:51.530
they end up becoming
super tactile animals.

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:52.470
They do really, really well

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:53.645
with tactile discrimination tasks.

00:09:53.645 --> 00:09:55.130
This is the ladder rung task

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:57.070
where the animal starts at one end

00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:59.030
of this ladder and moves to the other end

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:02.290
and you train him to walk
on evenly spaced rungs.

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:06.820
And then what you do is you
then space the rungs unevenly

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:08.150
and you have him do this task again.

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:09.460
And I'm gonna show you
some movies of this.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:10.310
This is a normal animal,

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:11.339
this is a bilateral nucleate

00:10:11.339 --> 00:10:13.770
and this is really pretty beautiful.

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:15.770
So here's what a normal animal looks like

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:18.890
and you can score them based
on when their legs fall through

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:19.723
and how well they do.

00:10:19.723 --> 00:10:20.760
You'll see this

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:25.760
and his legs falling
through, oops, oops, oops.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.500
He was trained but this
is now a novel task.

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:30.629
Here's the bilateral nucleate,

00:10:30.629 --> 00:10:32.530
no eyes whatsoever.

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:36.140
So it's never had any
access to visual input ever.

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:37.950
And so this is what the
bilateral nucleate looks like

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:39.250
on this novel task.

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:41.047
Look at this, bam.

00:10:41.047 --> 00:10:43.067
Okay, this is good.

00:10:43.067 --> 00:10:46.390
Okay, so we propose

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:47.767
that because the whiskers are so important

00:10:47.767 --> 00:10:49.902
and have this huge representation
of the whiskers now,

00:10:49.902 --> 00:10:51.628
we trim the whiskers.

00:10:51.628 --> 00:10:53.710
I know, I know, I know.

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:55.570
They grew back, they grew back, okay.

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:56.403
But check this out.

00:10:56.403 --> 00:10:57.236
This is so cool.

00:10:57.236 --> 00:10:59.335
This is the same animal
with his whiskers trimmed.

00:10:59.335 --> 00:11:01.093
And here's what happens.

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.370
So this is really cool

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:07.300
because you are showing
this enormous brain change

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:08.350
and behavior change

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:11.080
and the two coincide.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.064
And just to end this
little tiny portion of it.

00:11:13.064 --> 00:11:15.464
So blindness is not an absence of light

00:11:15.464 --> 00:11:17.756
because this animal has
functional respecification

00:11:17.756 --> 00:11:20.653
changes in cortical and
subcortical connections,

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:24.070
a really big magnification of its vibracy.

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:26.920
So its entire nervous system

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.580
has been kind of rewired and reorganized

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.130
based on this lack of sensory input.

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:32.130
But that's pretty,

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:34.140
that's sort of like taking a
sledgehammer to the system.

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:35.740
Let me show you something
a little more subtle.

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:37.970
This is natural differences
in rearing conditions,

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:40.210
cultural transmission of rearing style

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:41.130
and these are voles.

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:42.586
Voles are biparental,

00:11:42.586 --> 00:11:44.280
both parents rear their young.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.630
And we can measure differences

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:47.914
in total tactile contact with the young.

00:11:47.914 --> 00:11:50.490
We look at high contact
parents and low contact parents

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:51.323
and important to remember,

00:11:51.323 --> 00:11:53.480
is that high contact offspring

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.830
show differences in behavior,

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:57.470
high contact offspring
become high contact parents

00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:59.420
and if you cross foster
them on the day of birth,

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:00.910
you take low contact parents

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:02.390
and put them with high contact parents,

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:03.760
they become high contact parents.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.365
So this is a social
transmission of a rearing style.

00:12:06.365 --> 00:12:08.160
And if we look at the connections

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.320
of their somatosensory cortex,

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.300
particularly in the regions

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:11.760
of the body that are being touched,

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.960
we see the connections
are mostly the same.

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.780
This is an injection site

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:17.020
and these are connections to it.

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:18.960
But we also see
differences in connections.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.290
And remember this is pretty subtle.

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:21.540
And differences in connections

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:22.782
of frontal cortex as well.

00:12:22.782 --> 00:12:24.920
So what factors contribute
to the phenotype?

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.480
So I'm just showing you a
much more subtle example

00:12:29.158 --> 00:12:30.750
of the role of sensory input

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:31.600
in shaping the brain,

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:32.543
in shaping connectivity.

00:12:32.543 --> 00:12:34.220
Well genes definitely contribute

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:37.360
to cortical sheet size,
cortical field size,

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.324
cortical connections,
peripheral morphology

00:12:39.324 --> 00:12:42.300
and cellular mechanisms
involved in plasticity,

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:43.622
maybe genetically specified

00:12:43.622 --> 00:12:45.398
which allows the environment to impact

00:12:45.398 --> 00:12:47.250
some of these same things.

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:49.480
I can change cortical field
size, cortical connectivity,

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:50.480
peripheral morphology,

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.732
which I showed in these experiments.

00:12:51.732 --> 00:12:54.055
And I've given you examples
from the bill of the platypus

00:12:54.055 --> 00:12:57.377
and I suggested the same
thing is occurring in humans

00:12:57.377 --> 00:12:59.280
but what about things
like social learning,

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.363
language and culture?

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:02.530
I would suggest

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:03.856
that the best way to think about these

00:13:03.856 --> 00:13:07.015
as these are simply complex
patterns of physical stimuli

00:13:07.015 --> 00:13:09.680
that are impinging on the
developing nervous system.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:13.080
So mothers love is temperature, touch,

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:15.210
cadence of a voice, nothing more.

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:19.420
And this can impact how
the brain wires itself.

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:21.120
It can impact size of cortical fields

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.418
and connections of cortical fields.

00:13:22.418 --> 00:13:24.031
So I'm gonna end a little bit with this.

00:13:24.031 --> 00:13:26.641
This is a human evolution,

00:13:26.641 --> 00:13:28.420
not quite a cladogram.

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:30.510
And on the bottom is
environment and social context

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:33.295
and on the top it's
sort of truncated here,

00:13:33.295 --> 00:13:37.480
is meant to be morphology or genes.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.060
And modern hand is proposed
to have been around this

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:41.183
for about 700,000 years

00:13:41.183 --> 00:13:43.106
but what's really pretty fascinating

00:13:43.106 --> 00:13:47.208
is that until recently,
we were using stone tools.

00:13:47.208 --> 00:13:50.010
And big brains happened way back here.

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:51.480
So we had the big brain,

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.590
we had the modern hand

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:54.200
but we were not doing what we're doing

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.060
with the modern hand.

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:56.840
And if you believe that all behaviors

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:57.840
is generated by the brain,

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:00.000
and I believe that all behavior
is generated by the brain,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.500
then the brain must've changed.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:02.710
And if the brain didn't change

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:03.790
by changes in DNA sequence,

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:06.252
it must've changed by
activity-dependent mechanisms

00:14:06.252 --> 00:14:07.680
and/or culture.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:11.100
And so, it's hard to believe

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.070
that the industrial revolution

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:13.830
was less than 300 years ago.

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:14.663
And if you look,

00:14:14.663 --> 00:14:16.500
we've actually changed
the scape of this planet

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.880
and now we have daily and
prolonged interactions

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.070
with computers and machines and tools,

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:22.430
really sophisticated tools.

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:23.539
And I'll end by saying

00:14:23.539 --> 00:14:25.250
we are combinatorial creatures

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:27.230
constructed by genes, bodies, behaviors

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:28.330
and environmental context

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.288
and I think, you can look for the genes

00:14:30.288 --> 00:14:32.270
that are distinguishing humans,

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:33.870
I think you're gonna find only a few,

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:34.703
maybe some involved

00:14:34.703 --> 00:14:36.195
in expansion of the neocortex.

00:14:36.195 --> 00:14:37.423
But humans that have evolved

00:14:37.423 --> 00:14:40.023
an extraordinary capacity
to construct our neocortex

00:14:40.887 --> 00:14:42.900
over the course of a prolonged infancy

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.187
and childhood allowing for
rapid phenotypic change

00:14:45.187 --> 00:14:46.930
even within a single generation.

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:49.738
I would say that if Leah
Krubitzer were born 30 years ago

00:14:49.738 --> 00:14:53.750
or 100 years ago or 300,000 years ago,

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:54.936
I wouldn't be Leah Krubitzer

00:14:54.936 --> 00:14:57.910
hitting a rock or using a spear,

00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:59.126
I would be a different brain.

00:14:59.126 --> 00:15:01.670
We have a remarkable
fluid brain body interface

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:02.503
with the environment

00:15:02.503 --> 00:15:05.370
such that tools and machines
can extend our embodiment

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:07.000
and our peri personal space

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.450
and expand the loop between our brains,

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:09.590
our bodies and the world.

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:13.000
And I think this has made us
unique biohybrid creatures

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.840
who's brains adapt and
bootstrap themselves

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.390
with the technologies that we give rise to

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:18.810
and for better or worse,

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:21.021
with whom are futures are
increasingly entwined.

00:15:21.021 --> 00:15:22.380
Okay, thank you.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:25.380
(audience applause)

00:15:27.894 --> 00:15:29.462
- Paleoanthropologists once thought

00:15:29.462 --> 00:15:31.650
humans evolved in Europe and Asia

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:33.629
around 40 to 50,000 years ago.

00:15:33.629 --> 00:15:36.890
We now know homo sapiens evolved in Africa

00:15:37.829 --> 00:15:40.850
more than 100 to 300,000 years ago.

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:44.088
The evidence showing these earlier humans

00:15:44.088 --> 00:15:46.740
behaved in similar ways to recent humans

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:48.228
continues to surprise us.

00:15:48.228 --> 00:15:49.533
But should it?

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:53.040
Here's an example.

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.254
Several weeks ago,

00:15:54.254 --> 00:15:56.750
there was an article published in Nature,

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:59.640
an abstract drawing from
the 73,000 year old levels

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:01.780
at Blombos Cave in South Africa.

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:03.706
Now this is an important discovery

00:16:03.706 --> 00:16:06.810
and it's published in one
of the world's foremost

00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:08.339
and prestigious scientific journals

00:16:08.339 --> 00:16:11.880
but abstract drawings are
human cultural universals.

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.930
You're looking at some of them right now.

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:16.173
Everyone makes them.

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:18.300
Shouldn't we expect

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:21.430
that humans who lived in
South Africa 73,000 years ago

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:23.299
made abstract drawings too?

00:16:23.299 --> 00:16:27.697
Are early humans not
behavioring modern humans?

00:16:27.697 --> 00:16:29.393
Were they these primitive humans

00:16:29.393 --> 00:16:32.145
that anthropologists have been
looking for and not finding

00:16:32.145 --> 00:16:33.943
for more than two centuries?

00:16:35.703 --> 00:16:37.429
I think we have to ask

00:16:37.429 --> 00:16:39.580
what is behavioral modernity

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:41.084
and take a closer look at it.

00:16:41.084 --> 00:16:42.714
It's inferred quality

00:16:42.714 --> 00:16:46.080
based on unexpected
archeological discoveries,

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:49.330
art, symbols, carved bone
tools and similar things

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:53.650
rather than things predicted
from prior evolutionary theory

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:55.553
before the excavations started.

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:59.180
Modernity claims come first,

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:00.710
supporting evidence, arguments

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:02.533
and theoretical justifications

00:17:02.533 --> 00:17:04.924
are developed after the fact.

00:17:04.924 --> 00:17:07.100
This is not a good way to do science

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:09.860
and it is a demonstrably
poor way to do justice

00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:13.080
because long ago, people
in Salem, Massachusetts

00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:15.473
used this same approach
to identify witches.

00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:20.094
Witchcraft accusations came first.

00:17:20.094 --> 00:17:21.487
Evidence was then gathered

00:17:21.487 --> 00:17:23.812
and theories developed after the fact.

00:17:23.812 --> 00:17:25.929
More than 200 people were accused,

00:17:25.929 --> 00:17:27.710
dozens jailed.

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:30.490
19 hanged and one tortured to death.

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:32.770
And yet Massachusetts exonerated

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:37.133
most accused and convicted
witches 17 years later in 1703.

00:17:37.987 --> 00:17:40.000
Why should we expect our search

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.040
for prehistoric behaviorally modern humans

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.866
to be any more successful and enduring

00:17:43.866 --> 00:17:47.029
than Salem's search for witches?

00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:49.002
I don't think we should.

00:17:49.002 --> 00:17:52.040
So what's wrong with behavioral modernity?

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.988
First off, it's anti-evolutionary.

00:17:53.988 --> 00:17:56.604
It assumes all humans evolved convergently

00:17:56.604 --> 00:17:57.655
towards the same end

00:17:57.655 --> 00:18:01.239
and regardless of divergent
selective pressures.

00:18:01.239 --> 00:18:03.295
Secondly, it's a metaphor

00:18:03.295 --> 00:18:06.790
rather than measurable
property of the evidence.

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:10.646
And a metaphor that
archeologists choose selectively.

00:18:10.646 --> 00:18:11.940
It doesn't predict.

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:13.880
All of its interpretations

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.910
are made after the fact.

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:16.989
I think it's better to focus,

00:18:16.989 --> 00:18:17.900
and I'll propose,

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:21.410
it's better to focus on
behavioral complexity instead.

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:22.439
With behavioral modernity,

00:18:22.439 --> 00:18:23.850
different lightning bolts

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:26.160
will all produce the same
kinds of stone tools.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:29.360
Don't nap outdoors
during a lightning storm.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:30.302
With behavioral complexity,

00:18:30.302 --> 00:18:33.344
different causes beget different results.

00:18:33.344 --> 00:18:37.147
So what is behavioral complexity?

00:18:37.147 --> 00:18:39.910
Well, key features of complex phenomena

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:40.902
include multiple parts

00:18:40.902 --> 00:18:43.433
that interact with one
another systematically.

00:18:43.433 --> 00:18:47.485
Different inputs create different outputs.

00:18:47.485 --> 00:18:51.310
And historical and geographic
variation among inputs

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:53.720
creates complexly-patterned variability

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.110
among the outputs.

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:56.230
That whole system,

00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:57.160
too much systems theory.

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:58.286
Here's a practical example.

00:18:58.286 --> 00:19:00.840
Folk art is a complex phenomenon

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:03.370
in which artists, cultures,
materials and markets

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:05.250
interact dynamically with one another.

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:06.832
If you think folk art is simple

00:19:06.832 --> 00:19:09.930
do please join us in Santa Fe, New Mexico

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:12.400
for the International Folk Art Festival

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.220
that happens each July.

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:18.370
Handcrafted artifacts vary
historically and geographically

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:20.233
in complexly patterned ways.

00:19:21.807 --> 00:19:26.140
So how complex was early
human stone working?

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:28.750
Today, stone working or making stone tools

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:30.710
is a handy craft, a folk art,

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:32.253
of which I'm a practitioner.

00:19:34.103 --> 00:19:35.980
It's also a reasonable
source of hypotheses

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:38.560
about prehistoric stoneworking

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:41.143
because it's familiar, we can observe it.

00:19:41.143 --> 00:19:44.110
If early Homo sapiens
had similar capacities

00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:46.216
for behavioral variability,

00:19:46.216 --> 00:19:50.100
excuse me, for behavioral
complexity to ours

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.450
and different ones from earlier hominins,

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:55.190
then their first appearances
in the fossil record

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:59.000
should coincide with onsets
of complexly patterned

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.600
stone tool variability.

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:01.680
Here's a prediction.

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:02.820
Does it?

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:03.980
Well indeed it does.

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:06.540
After 100 to 300,000 years ago,

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:08.802
Homo sapiens first appearances everywhere

00:20:08.802 --> 00:20:12.394
coincide with increasingly
complex and patterned

00:20:12.394 --> 00:20:14.820
stone tool variability.

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:18.303
So what is complexly patterned
stone tool variability?

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:22.403
I hope this slide captures it well.

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:24.463
To make my point,

00:20:24.463 --> 00:20:26.190
I've stripped away all
the hints you would have

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:27.490
to the origins of these artifacts

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:28.540
from their raw materials

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:30.493
and substituted them with drawings.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.760
The objects in blue here

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.720
date to more than 300,000 years ago

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.240
and their artifact designs,

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.680
their shapes, their morphology,

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.260
their patterns of modification,

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:42.843
only weakly indicate geographic origin

00:20:42.843 --> 00:20:45.808
and their age, if they do so at all.

00:20:45.808 --> 00:20:48.830
Now in the past, I've
offered to have a contest

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:50.540
and offered a $20 bill

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:51.390
to anybody who can guess

00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:52.350
where the object,

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:54.300
the teardrop shaped object comes from,

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:58.229
but I'm told that that
would be improper, hehe.

00:20:58.229 --> 00:21:00.050
(giggles)

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:02.350
Okay, now less than 100,000 years ago,

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:05.340
artifact designs indicate
age and geographic origin

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:07.390
with increasing precision.

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:09.840
The objects outlined
in red are a bit older,

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.170
they're closer to around
100,000 years ago.

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:14.110
If you're to guess their ages,

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:16.270
you'd probably come within 10,000 years,

00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:17.857
maybe 100,000 years.

00:21:17.857 --> 00:21:19.970
But the objects in black,

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:21.920
the objects in black are more recent.

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:23.910
They're younger than 40,000 years.

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:25.010
And with some of them,

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:28.407
we can narrow down their
occurrence to 2,000 years.

00:21:28.407 --> 00:21:31.570
The object, let's see,
one, two, three, four,

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:33.630
fourth from the right there,

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:36.414
the one with the hollow sort of base,

00:21:36.414 --> 00:21:39.394
that's an artifact found
here in North America

00:21:39.394 --> 00:21:43.260
but from the Mississippi
River to the Rocky Mountains

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:44.550
and up to the Great Plains

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:47.100
over the course of about two centuries.

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:48.798
Excuse me, 2,000 years.

00:21:48.798 --> 00:21:51.750
What do stone tools teach us?

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:55.220
First off, stone tools are
indestructible evidence

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:58.003
about mind-technology relationships.

00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:03.860
This evidence shows complex
mind-technology relationships

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:05.670
were in place among early humans

00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:08.533
at least 100 to 300,000 years ago.

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:11.740
Increasingly complex stone tool

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:13.070
and other artifact variability

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:15.260
since 100,000 years ago

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:18.382
suggests mind-technology
relationships changed

00:22:18.382 --> 00:22:20.810
during the course of human evolution.

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:22.010
So if we're trying to discover

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:24.630
the influence of the mind on technology

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:26.220
and technology on the mind,

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:28.920
we need to remember we're
shooting at a moving target.

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:34.170
So why?

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:35.350
These are the fun questions.

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:37.390
Why does stone tool variability

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:40.130
become increasingly complex and patterned?

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:42.177
Tools can be evolutionarily advantageous

00:22:42.177 --> 00:22:46.163
but they come with costs
few other animals tolerate.

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.570
Other primates occasionally use tools

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:54.981
but only Homo sapiens are
obligatory tool users.

00:22:54.981 --> 00:22:58.360
Obligatory tool use is irreversible,

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:01.910
even the best survival
experts require tools.

00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:03.730
How many of you guys will
fess up to seeing this show,

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:04.658
Naked and Afraid?

00:23:04.658 --> 00:23:07.890
Come on, you've seen this.

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:09.410
I know at least one other
of you in the audience

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:12.190
has been like me, recruited
to participate in it.

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:13.220
I don't want to treat my students

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:15.570
to pictures of me running
around without clothes.

00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:17.900
They couldn't get
insurance for this program

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:20.300
unless they equipped the
contestants with tools.

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:22.917
It wouldn't be called Naked and Afraid,

00:23:22.917 --> 00:23:24.617
it would be called Naked and Dead.

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:31.150
Now as I say, it's irreversible,

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:33.350
we can't go back.

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:36.370
More tool use increases
cultural differences potential,

00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:38.580
influence on tool making strategies.

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:41.723
I like to call this the no,
you're doing it wrong effect.

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:44.427
So what do we know,

00:23:44.427 --> 00:23:45.761
what do we not know

00:23:45.761 --> 00:23:47.393
and what do we want to know?

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:49.630
We know obligatory tool use

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:51.950
is intrinsically complex and variable

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:54.530
and these are quantities we can measure

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:56.960
using the stone tool evidence.

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.248
We do not know

00:23:58.248 --> 00:24:00.105
whether obligatory tool use

00:24:00.105 --> 00:24:02.140
was a uniquely derived characteristic

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:03.710
of Homo sapien's behavior

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:07.540
or one shared by other
hominins now extinct,

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:09.883
such as denisovans and
neanderthals, perhaps.

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:14.680
We find ourselves in a happy spot

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:16.610
where we have new research questions.

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:18.330
You always want to come up
with new research questions.

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:20.210
You don't want to just hang up your spears

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:23.092
and go do something else.

00:24:23.092 --> 00:24:26.250
How did obligatory tool
use change the human mind

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:29.398
from earlier primate
and hominin conditions?

00:24:29.398 --> 00:24:32.593
And how do we didect obligatory tool use?

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:35.250
Now some of my colleagues might say,

00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:36.906
and I'm not referring
to anyone in the room,

00:24:36.906 --> 00:24:38.250
some of my colleagues might say

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:42.170
we have an arsenal of ways
of measuring stone tools

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:43.580
and quantifying their variability

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:46.516
that we've been using for 200 years.

00:24:46.516 --> 00:24:47.940
But archeologists

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:50.741
who formulated those
measurements 200 years ago

00:24:50.741 --> 00:24:54.590
weren't thinking about
obligatory tool use.

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:55.860
So we're in a situation

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:58.320
where we have a tool box
full of hammers and chisels

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:02.650
and we're setting forth
to change the battery

00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:04.330
on an iPhone.

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:06.480
So I don't think the existing tools

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.925
archeologists used to
characterize the stone tool record

00:25:08.925 --> 00:25:12.480
are necessarily unhelpful

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.622
but we have to prove that value.

00:25:14.622 --> 00:25:16.096
Thank you.

00:25:16.096 --> 00:25:19.096
(audience applause)

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:26.480
- I'd like to thank Tim and Pat

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:29.350
for inviting me to this
very interesting symposium

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:31.883
and of course the entire
Carta organization.

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.870
Language coevolved with the human brain

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:43.470
throughout evolution of Homo sapiens.

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:45.300
Writing, on the other hand,

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.670
which is actually what my topic is,

00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:50.630
is a relatively new technology

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:52.190
that was invented by humans

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:56.018
to translate spoken
language into a visual form

00:25:56.018 --> 00:26:00.006
for the purpose of transmitting
verbal communication

00:26:00.006 --> 00:26:05.006
broadly to many people over
large distances and time.

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:08.530
As such, reading and writing

00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:11.513
can be considered the first social media.

00:26:13.995 --> 00:26:18.300
Reading is an example of what's
called neuronal recycling,

00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:21.299
the recruitment of previously
evolved neural circuits

00:26:21.299 --> 00:26:24.821
to accomplish cultural innovations.

00:26:24.821 --> 00:26:26.870
It's important to point out

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:30.390
that while language develops
naturally in most humans

00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:34.449
based on exposure rather
than explicit instruction,

00:26:34.449 --> 00:26:37.890
reading and writing require
painstaking instruction

00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:41.370
and years of practice
to reach proficiency.

00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:44.016
This slide shows the typical
reading brain network

00:26:44.016 --> 00:26:45.774
with its key components

00:26:45.774 --> 00:26:49.380
as established initially in an older view

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:53.230
by studies of patients with
acquired brain lesions.

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:57.070
And more recently, using modern
brain imaging technologies,

00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:58.833
we have a lot more information.

00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:03.940
This talk will trace the history

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:06.663
of the invention of writing,

00:27:09.266 --> 00:27:12.280
how English writing developed

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:16.270
and ended up with such a
cockeyed spelling system

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:19.013
which leads in many cases to dyslexia,

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:22.470
and discuss how modern technologies

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:25.303
are impacting reading and writing today.

00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:28.600
I'd like to begin with a brief overview

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:31.563
of the history of the
invention of writing.

00:27:33.156 --> 00:27:35.820
Writing is a physical manifestation

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:37.920
of a spoken language.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.820
It's thought that human beings
developed spoken language

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:43.878
about 35,000 BC

00:27:43.878 --> 00:27:48.350
as evidenced by, wow
yeah, by cave paintings

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:51.150
from the period of cro magnum man.

00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:53.520
Writing numbers for the
purpose of record keeping

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:57.101
began long before writing of language.

00:27:57.101 --> 00:27:59.029
Written language doesn't emerge

00:27:59.029 --> 00:28:03.100
until the invention in Sumer
in southern Mesopotamia

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:06.650
around 3,500 BC.

00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:10.581
This writing system is
known as Cuneiform writing.

00:28:10.581 --> 00:28:14.220
It's generally agreed that
true writing of language

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:17.140
was independently conceived and developed

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:21.170
by at least two ancient
civilizations and possibly more.

00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:25.230
In Sumer and also in
Mesoamerica by the Maya

00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:27.633
in 500 to 300 BC.

00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:33.100
Writing systems also arose
in Egypt around 3100 BC

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:36.237
and China around 1200 BC.

00:28:36.237 --> 00:28:38.170
But historians debate

00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:39.500
whether these writing systems

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:42.666
were developed completely
independently of Sumerian writing

00:28:42.666 --> 00:28:46.810
or whether either or both were
inspired by Sumerian writing

00:28:46.810 --> 00:28:49.163
by a process of cultural diffusion.

00:28:50.343 --> 00:28:53.430
The Sumerian Cuneiform writing system

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:55.950
was in use for more than three millennia

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:57.870
through several stages of development

00:28:57.870 --> 00:28:59.860
as can be seen on this slide

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:02.317
by looking at the
transformation of the sign

00:29:02.317 --> 00:29:04.620
for head SAG

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:08.710
beginning with pictograms in 3000 BC.

00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:10.700
Ultimately it was completely replaced

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:13.358
by alphabetic writing
in the general sense.

00:29:13.358 --> 00:29:15.797
In the course of the Roman era,

00:29:15.797 --> 00:29:20.163
there are no Cuneiform
writing systems in use today.

00:29:21.343 --> 00:29:24.450
While the development
of Phoenician alphabet

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:26.701
is often attributed to,

00:29:26.701 --> 00:29:30.320
the Phonetic alphabet is
also often contributed

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:31.510
to the Phoenicians,

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:34.770
they didn't actually
invent it or create it.

00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:37.960
Rather, they imported it
piecemeal from Egypt and Crete

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:41.670
and took it to every city
on the Mediterranean.

00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:42.910
By the time of Homer,

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:45.060
the Greeks were taking over the Phoenician

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:48.000
or allied Aramaic, alphabetic writing

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.190
and were calling it by the Semitic names

00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:53.600
of the first two letters, alpha and beta.

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.240
The Latin alphabet was established

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:57.633
by the seventh century BC.

00:29:58.814 --> 00:30:01.620
Before the invention of the
printing press in Europe

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:03.400
around 1455,

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:06.710
all books were handwritten
and usually highly decorated

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:08.290
until about the 12th century,

00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:10.491
the most elaborate and
beautiful illuminations

00:30:10.491 --> 00:30:12.660
were devoted to religious works

00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:16.370
and most manuscripts were
produced in monasteries.

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:17.440
During the middle ages,

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:19.650
the Latin alphabet was used extensively

00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:21.211
for writing in Europe.

00:30:21.211 --> 00:30:23.200
With the age of colonialism

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.781
and Christian evangelism

00:30:24.781 --> 00:30:28.883
the Latin scripts spread
widely well beyond Europe.

00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:33.380
I'd now like to change the focus

00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:36.120
to the history of English writing

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:37.970
and explain how English writing

00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:40.600
ended up with such a
cockeyed spelling system

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:42.893
which leads in many cases to dyslexia.

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:47.150
The English language itself

00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:50.960
is a compilation of several
different languages,

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:54.910
mostly Anglo-Saxon, French and Latin

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:56.960
because England just kept getting invaded

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.650
by people who spoke different languages.

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:01.430
The only thing we have in English

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:04.690
up until about 1400 are called patois.

00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:06.270
They're a clumsy peasant language

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:09.690
without any standardized writing system.

00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:11.490
There wasn't even a vocabulary

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:13.860
to carry on business in English.

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:16.830
It was all done in French or Latin.

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:19.610
However, when King Henry the Fifth

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:22.120
took the throne of England in 1412,

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:24.520
he had plans to invade France.

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.770
So speaking French wasn't gonna work.

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:29.046
He realized that if he
wanted to get support

00:31:29.046 --> 00:31:30.740
from the common people,

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:32.850
they would have to change the language

00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:36.853
of Parliament and business
from French to English.

00:31:38.434 --> 00:31:39.490
At this time,

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:41.940
the only people who could
write at all in England

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:45.310
were just a handful of men
called chancery scribes

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:49.590
who wrote by hand and
almost exclusively in Latin.

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:53.650
Latin has a transparent
one to one correspondence

00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:57.480
between the number of discrete
sounds, called phonemes,

00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:59.130
in spoken Latin

00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:03.150
and how they're mapped by
the letters in the alphabet.

00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:06.140
As such, learning to read
Latin's a piece of cake.

00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:08.258
All you have to do is
learn the single letter

00:32:08.258 --> 00:32:11.170
that goes with each phoneme in Latin

00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:13.140
and then just pronounce them in order

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:14.413
to produce words.

00:32:15.761 --> 00:32:19.660
King Henry the Fifth
directed his chancery scribes

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:22.260
to create a written version of English

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:25.630
so that he could communicate
more broadly with his subjects.

00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:28.045
However, there was
little or no instruction

00:32:28.045 --> 00:32:31.170
as to how they were supposed to do this.

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:34.300
The problem they faced was
that the written Latin alphabet

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:36.700
was designed to represent one on one,

00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:40.710
each of the 23 phonemes in spoken Latin.

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:42.840
It was never fit well for English

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:45.380
which has 44 phonemes.

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:50.380
For example, Latin didn't
have a sh, th or ch sound.

00:32:51.602 --> 00:32:53.991
So with only 23 Latin letters,

00:32:53.991 --> 00:32:56.300
there was no letter to represent these

00:32:56.300 --> 00:33:00.110
and many of the other 44 English phonemes.

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:01.310
Faced with this problem,

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:03.550
the chancery scribes just apparently

00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:05.980
made up multi-letter combinations

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:08.323
to represent these single phonemes.

00:33:09.658 --> 00:33:12.201
So for example on this slide,

00:33:12.201 --> 00:33:17.201
you could see that the letter string t-h-e

00:33:17.413 --> 00:33:20.887
pronounced phonetically should be te-hu-e

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:26.700
and s-h-e, sa-hu-e.

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:27.980
So as many children are told

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:30.120
just say those and blend
the together quickly

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:31.420
and what do you get?

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:32.650
Sa-hu-e.

00:33:33.984 --> 00:33:37.260
(audience laughing)

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:38.390
In case you ever wondered

00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:41.160
how we ended up with the
non-transparent mapping

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:43.060
from spoken to written English

00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:44.980
that leads so many children and people

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:47.160
learning English as a second language

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:49.630
to struggle to learn to read and spell.

00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:52.590
It all began here in the 15th century.

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:55.400
Nearly 600 years before Gutenberg,

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:58.420
Chinese monks were setting ink to paper

00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:01.390
using a method known as block printing.

00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:03.880
What really set Gutenberg's
technology apart

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:05.390
from the Chinese

00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:07.000
was the development of a press

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.420
that could mechanize the transfer of ink

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:11.713
from movable type to paper.

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:14.080
For the first time in history,

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:16.234
books could be mass produced.

00:34:16.234 --> 00:34:20.450
Gutenberg's first major work in 1454

00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:25.450
was the 42 line Gutenberg
bible printed in Latin.

00:34:26.849 --> 00:34:29.150
With the invention of the printing press,

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:33.020
printing soon became the first
means of mass communication,

00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:35.660
really the first social media.

00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:39.060
It put more knowledge in the
hands of more people faster

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:42.380
and more cheaply than ever before.

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:44.090
As a result, reading and writing,

00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:46.240
which up until that time
was really something

00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:49.150
done by a very, very
small number of people

00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:51.143
spread widely and rapidly.

00:34:52.409 --> 00:34:54.740
Caxton brought the first printing press

00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:59.740
from Bruges to London in 1476
for the Canterbury Tales.

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:02.260
With the advent of the printing press,

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:05.846
the complex and often cockeyed
spelling patterns for English

00:35:05.846 --> 00:35:10.000
that remain to this day were solidified

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.400
giving rise to generation after generation

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:13.490
of children and adults

00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:15.900
who struggled to learn to read and write,

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:17.433
particularly in English.

00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:21.150
Let me acknowledge here that I'm indebted

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:24.010
to a wonderful website which
I'll highly recommend to you

00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:27.711
called childrenofthecode.org.

00:35:27.711 --> 00:35:30.831
The website's creator, David Bolton,

00:35:30.831 --> 00:35:32.840
gave much of the information

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:35.300
by interviewing scientists
and anthropologists

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:36.710
for many years

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:39.590
and I've synthesized a
lot of this for this talk.

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:42.340
I highly recommend that
you explore this website

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:44.570
for additional information on this topic

00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:45.970
of reading and writing,

00:35:45.970 --> 00:35:47.300
the history of reading and writing

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:49.461
and especially dyslexia.

00:35:49.461 --> 00:35:51.694
I quote from David Bolton,

00:35:51.694 --> 00:35:54.577
"There weren't any cognitive scientists

00:35:54.577 --> 00:35:56.727
"or neuroscientists or psychologists

00:35:56.727 --> 00:35:58.747
"or even child development experts

00:35:58.747 --> 00:36:01.583
"involved in creating the
English writing system.

00:36:03.127 --> 00:36:04.817
"There wasn't any concern

00:36:04.817 --> 00:36:06.577
"for hundreds of millions of children

00:36:06.577 --> 00:36:07.487
"who would struggle

00:36:07.487 --> 00:36:10.967
"since this code was
created in the 15th century.

00:36:10.967 --> 00:36:13.527
"There were just a small
number of chancery scribes

00:36:13.527 --> 00:36:14.847
"doing their very best

00:36:14.847 --> 00:36:17.637
"to shove a technology created for Latin

00:36:17.637 --> 00:36:21.747
"into a language it
was never designed for.

00:36:21.747 --> 00:36:24.913
"Those who eventually do manage
to overcome the confusion

00:36:24.913 --> 00:36:27.090
"and learn how to break the code,

00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:29.453
"to become phonologically aware

00:36:29.453 --> 00:36:32.147
"are able to use the areas of the brain

00:36:32.147 --> 00:36:35.308
"that reading has recycled
from speech and language."

00:36:35.308 --> 00:36:36.983
These areas here.

00:36:38.582 --> 00:36:42.997
"Those who cannot break
this code become dyslexic."

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:48.330
According to the United
States Department of Education

00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:53.330
in 2017, more than 60% of US
K through 12 school children

00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:56.020
are reading below proficiency

00:36:56.020 --> 00:37:00.308
and more than 70% writing
below the level of proficiency

00:37:00.308 --> 00:37:02.960
for that grade level.

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:05.163
Let these stunning numbers sink in.

00:37:07.268 --> 00:37:11.590
Reading is the skill that
matters most to success in school

00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:14.130
and children who fall behind in reading

00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:16.760
are in great academic danger.

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:19.340
But it's not just the
lack of reading skills

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:21.418
that most endanger these children.

00:37:21.418 --> 00:37:24.110
It's the collateral damage.

00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:28.330
It's their mind shame
that fates their future.

00:37:28.330 --> 00:37:30.280
As seen on this video clip being shown

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:32.520
with permission of Children of the Code.

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:35.570
- My teacher asked me to come
into the front of the class

00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:36.403
and read a book

00:37:36.403 --> 00:37:39.450
and everybody was just staring at me

00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:41.151
and I got real nervous

00:37:41.151 --> 00:37:43.126
'cause I didn't want
to mess up or anything.

00:37:43.126 --> 00:37:44.517
And then when I started reading,

00:37:44.517 --> 00:37:45.692
I started messing up

00:37:45.692 --> 00:37:47.950
and I just couldn't help it

00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:49.930
and everybody started
laughing at me and stuff.

00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:52.320
- Like the teacher would
ask me to read something

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:54.760
and I would read it and
I'd get a wrong word

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:56.946
or I'd go too slow and
they'll make fun of me.

00:37:56.946 --> 00:37:58.660
- I kept messing up on the words

00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:00.210
and people kept laughing at me.

00:38:01.389 --> 00:38:03.750
- They said that you
don't know how to read,

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:08.750
I bet you won't be able to
how to read when you grow up.

00:38:10.944 --> 00:38:15.897
- They always laugh at me if
I get twist up with words.

00:38:15.897 --> 00:38:18.796
It makes my heart drop

00:38:18.796 --> 00:38:21.653
'cause it seem like they
not my friend no more.

00:38:22.692 --> 00:38:25.920
- The collateral damage
caused by literacy problems

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:28.962
in the United States alone is immense.

00:38:28.962 --> 00:38:33.962
75% to 80% of students
identified as learning disabled

00:38:34.404 --> 00:38:38.680
have their basic deficits
in language and reading.

00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:39.968
Academic success,

00:38:39.968 --> 00:38:43.610
as defined by high school graduation,

00:38:43.610 --> 00:38:46.650
can be predicted by knowing
someone's reading skill

00:38:46.650 --> 00:38:49.185
at the end of third grade.

00:38:49.185 --> 00:38:52.250
56% of students with learning disabilities

00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:54.913
will drop out of school and be arrested.

00:38:56.488 --> 00:39:00.570
60% of adolescents in
treatment for substance abuse

00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:02.143
have learning disabilities.

00:39:03.434 --> 00:39:08.090
50% of females with learning
disabilities will be mothers,

00:39:08.090 --> 00:39:09.740
many of them single mothers,

00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:13.223
within three to five years
of leaving high school.

00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:17.357
Learning disabilities and substance abuse

00:39:17.357 --> 00:39:22.357
are the number one reason for
keeping welfare recipients

00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:26.023
from becoming and remaining employed.

00:39:28.729 --> 00:39:31.120
Now I'm gonna turn to discussing

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:34.170
how modern technologies
are impacting reading

00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:35.503
and writing today.

00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:42.490
Lest we forget,

00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:46.730
the human brain is an
exquisitely adaptable machine.

00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:48.180
Even though written language

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:50.290
did not evolve like spoken language did

00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:52.550
over tens of millions of years ago,

00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:55.340
since the invention of
writing and reading,

00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:58.370
the remarkable neuroplasticity
of the human brain

00:39:58.370 --> 00:40:00.720
has supported the rapid formation

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:05.430
of a highly elaborate
literacy brain circuit.

00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:10.220
Literacy is a unique
epigenetic achievement

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:12.279
that changes what we perceive,

00:40:12.279 --> 00:40:15.510
how we think and how we feel,

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:18.140
that is who we are.

00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:20.560
I think it's fair to say
that reading and writing,

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:23.260
perhaps more than any other technology

00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:24.950
have had the greatest impact

00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:29.035
on the advancement of Homo
sapien brain and mind.

00:40:29.035 --> 00:40:31.761
As we gain proficiency
in reading and writing,

00:40:31.761 --> 00:40:35.469
the continual use of our
literacy brain circuit

00:40:35.469 --> 00:40:39.693
feeds back, elaborates
and strengthens itself.

00:40:39.693 --> 00:40:43.199
But just as this brain
circuit developed very rapidly

00:40:43.199 --> 00:40:45.083
in evolutionary terms

00:40:45.083 --> 00:40:50.083
or perhaps because it was so rapid,

00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:55.150
this circuit is also more
vulnerable to change,

00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:59.733
if not continuously reinforced
by experience and use.

00:41:01.368 --> 00:41:04.020
Only if we continuously work

00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:07.440
to develop and use the
elaborated, analytical,

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:09.987
inferential and empathetic skills

00:41:09.987 --> 00:41:12.570
that have been developed by literacy

00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:15.150
will the neural networks
underlying these skills

00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:19.930
continue to sustain our
capacity to be attentive,

00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:22.360
thoughtful, critical thinkers

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:27.360
rather than passive consumers
of facts, real or fake.

00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:32.810
Despite alphabetic writing

00:41:32.810 --> 00:41:34.951
not changing much since the invention

00:41:34.951 --> 00:41:39.133
of the printing press in the 15th century,

00:41:40.338 --> 00:41:44.980
modern technologies, particularly
social media technologies

00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:47.460
are having a very rapid
and profound effect

00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:50.860
on writing practices in the 21st century.

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:53.200
Interestingly, many of
these new technologies

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:56.160
are making less use of
alphabetic writing systems

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:59.420
and more use once again of pictographs,

00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:00.663
as can be seen here

00:42:00.663 --> 00:42:05.410
comparing the Egyptian
hieroglyphics of 3100 BC

00:42:05.410 --> 00:42:07.980
to a thank you note I recently
received from my niece

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:11.747
that says, "Dinner was awesome.

00:42:11.747 --> 00:42:13.737
"It was a gift.

00:42:13.737 --> 00:42:14.877
"Thanks."

00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:21.690
And another example,

00:42:21.690 --> 00:42:24.200
a Chinese pictograph for medical marijuana

00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:27.334
originally from 10,000 years ago

00:42:27.334 --> 00:42:31.803
and a clip art symbol for
medical marijuana from 2017.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.669
Since the 15th century,

00:42:35.669 --> 00:42:38.530
despite many changes in spoken English

00:42:38.530 --> 00:42:41.900
from old English to middle English

00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:45.170
to early modern and late modern English,

00:42:45.170 --> 00:42:48.958
like here it says, then
she went to speak the

00:42:48.958 --> 00:42:51.003
whatever English tongue,

00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:56.680
written English has
used the same 26 letters

00:42:56.680 --> 00:43:00.823
to represent the 44 sounds
of English until now.

00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:03.997
The bottom line reads,

00:43:03.997 --> 00:43:08.997
"Then she went to speak this
digital age English tongue."

00:43:12.637 --> 00:43:15.844
Neuroscientists like me
who specialize in reading

00:43:15.844 --> 00:43:18.120
are frequently asked these days

00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:20.930
how might these rapid
technological changes

00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:23.403
in reading and writing
affect the human mind?

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:26.280
My colleague, Dr. Maryanne Wolf,

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:28.250
focuses on exactly this question

00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:31.170
in her new book Reader, Come Home.

00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:34.080
I'd like to close with some
of the profound insights

00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:35.603
from this timely book.

00:43:36.867 --> 00:43:40.727
"As we move from a literary
and word-based culture

00:43:40.727 --> 00:43:45.091
"into a far faster paced
digital and screen-based one,

00:43:45.091 --> 00:43:49.253
"we face an existential
dilemma in this new millennium.

00:43:51.717 --> 00:43:53.517
"There are many things that would be lost

00:43:53.517 --> 00:43:56.527
"if we slowly lose the cognitive patience

00:43:56.527 --> 00:43:59.447
"to immerse ourselves in the worlds

00:43:59.447 --> 00:44:00.897
"that are created by books

00:44:00.897 --> 00:44:03.667
"and the lives, feelings,
thoughts and insights

00:44:03.667 --> 00:44:06.160
"of the characters who inhabit them."

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:08.430
In a culture that increasingly rewards

00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:11.350
immediacy, ease and efficiency,

00:44:11.350 --> 00:44:13.800
the demanding time and effort involved

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:16.409
in what Dr. Wolfe refers
to as, deep reading

00:44:16.409 --> 00:44:20.470
make it an increasingly embattled entity.

00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:24.800
In closing, I ask each of you
to consider this question,

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:27.610
will the very plasticity
of the literate brain

00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:31.360
as it begins to reflect the
characteristics of digital media

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:33.360
that we and our children are increasingly

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:35.140
immersing ourselves in

00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:37.522
precipitate the atrophy

00:44:37.522 --> 00:44:40.730
of our most essential thought processes,

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:44.810
sustained attention, critical analysis,

00:44:44.810 --> 00:44:46.680
empathy and reflection

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:48.960
and indeed wisdom,

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:51.850
to the detriment of democratic societies

00:44:51.850 --> 00:44:53.900
that critically depend on these,

00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:55.930
the most essential characteristics

00:44:55.930 --> 00:44:58.940
of the enlightened, literate individual?

00:44:58.940 --> 00:44:59.999
Thank you.

00:44:59.999 --> 00:45:02.999
(audience applause)

00:45:07.277 --> 00:45:09.944
(upbeat music)
