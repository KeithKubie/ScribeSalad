00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.480
What is the image of the polygon
below after the rotation?

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.879
So this is a rotational
transformation of 270 degrees.

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:10.420
So what we-- and
when they talk about

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.850
a rotational
transformation, at least

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.433
in the context of
this exercise, we're

00:00:13.433 --> 00:00:16.140
talking about a rotation
around the origin,

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.552
so around this point.

00:00:17.552 --> 00:00:19.010
So the way I like
to think about it

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.540
is pick one of these points,
one of these orange points,

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.570
and, essentially, rotate it
around the origin 270 degrees.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:26.620
So let's do that.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.500
So this would be rotating it.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.730
And when we talk
about positive angles,

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.520
we're talking about going in
the counterclockwise directions.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.070
The same way that we,
typically, measure angles

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.120
when we're doing trigonometry
with the unit circle and things

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.930
like that.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.720
So here, so we started here,
and let's rotate 90 degrees.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.200
Then we could keep rotating,
rotate another 90 degrees

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.640
so we've rotated a
total of 180 degrees.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.790
And then we rotate 90 more
degrees to get to 270.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.300
Let's do a couple more of these.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.010
What is the transformation that
rotates the blue solid shape

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.260
to the orange dashed shape?

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.810
Now, this one's
a little bit-- we

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.500
don't have the manipulative
here to help us

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.210
answer that question
so this is really

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.240
going to challenge our
powers of visualization.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.240
So the main thing is to pick
a point on the blue shape

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.910
and see where does it end up
on the orange dashed shape.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.680
And I'll pick this
point right over here

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.430
because you can see
it's pointing straight

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:28.830
to the top left.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.510
And then when you go onto
the orange dashed shape,

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.450
it's pointing to
the bottom right.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.891
So this one went
all the way around.

00:01:35.891 --> 00:01:37.640
So you could say it
went-- it was pointing

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.520
from this direction
and went all the way

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.350
to going in the exact
opposite direction.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.870
So this was a 180-degree
transformation,

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.980
a 180-degree rotation.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.360
Let's do a few more.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.940
So what's the image
of the polygon?

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.580
So they want us to do
another 270-degree rotation.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.160
So like before.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.130
So let's rotate this
3/4 of the way around.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.840
So let's see how we can do that.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.896
So right now-- so this is going
to be a little bit trickier.

00:02:07.896 --> 00:02:10.479
So if we-- actually, I'm going
to pick this point because it's

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.900
easier to visualize
the 270 degrees.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.910
So now we've done 90 degrees.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.470
Now we can do 180 degrees.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.580
And now we've done 270 degrees.
