00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.500
Going back to our browser, we'll refresh the page and

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.840
see here that only a single chart was drawn.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.700
And before we finish with this bar chart, I just wanted to point out some of

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.370
the benefits of using a high-level library like Dimple.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.400
If you notice, by hovering over a bar, we can see both the date and

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.180
attendance of the game.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.350
And we get this horizontal bar that gets animated out.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.600
The tooltip's great,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.730
because it gives us a much finer look into the actual values of our data.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.150
And the horizontal bar the projects out is useful if we want to compare

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.730
one bar to all the others and see if its value's greater or less than.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.600
Are there any things that look off with this plot?

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.640
Or possibly things that could be improved?
