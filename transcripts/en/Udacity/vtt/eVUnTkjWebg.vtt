00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.170
Email marketing goes under
the umbrella of inbound marketing.

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.420
Email is the workhorse of marketing.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.400
However, you need to learn how
to use it right, and well, so

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.620
you can actually add
value to your users.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.650
Otherwise, you're just
another spam in the inbox.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.820
Now there are a ton of platforms out
there that can help you manage your

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:16.680
email marketing.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.550
Most have some basic free features,

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.330
so, you can consider email marketing
as a free marketing channel.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.820
You can break email
into two main purposes.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.230
Both engagement and acquisition.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.670
Email can be use as a way
to keep people engaged.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.031
Whether it's about a new
feature announcement or

00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:34.310
continue engaging in your product.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:39.030
On the other hand, emails also used by
many e-commerce sites to drive sales

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.330
in acquire new customers.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.900
So what's important in an email?

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.140
Well first,
you need to establish a goal and

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.130
you need to develop the right
messaging for your audience.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.780
Now based on your knowledge of
your audience, and how you're

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.400
positioning yourself, you should know
the tone of voice for your company.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.500
You should use the same tone of voice in
your social posts, your blog posts, and

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.890
in your emails.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.390
And just like in the rest of marketing,
you should be testing your message and

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.400
adapting to what works best for
your audience.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.450
With email marketing and
the different messaging platforms,

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.210
you're going to want to make sure
you're tracking some important things.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.630
Like opens, clicks, unsubscribes and
click through rates.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.000
Now, depending on the metric your
optimizing for, which is, of course,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.440
determined by your goal, you'll test
different components of the email.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.940
For example, if your goal is
to increase the open rate.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.950
Then you're going to want to test your
subject line to get more people to

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.770
actually open that email.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.460
If your overall goal for
your email is to increase sales,

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.900
then the subject line
isn't going to be enough.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.400
The body of the email is going to have
to drive those sales, so using a clear

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.780
call to action and those hooks that
really attract your customers.
