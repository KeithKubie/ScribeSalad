00:00:04.131 --> 00:00:06.670
MALE SPEAKER: Google Code Jam
is the largest individual

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.990
programming competition
in the world.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.740
This is our 10th year
of running it.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.630
And this year, the finals
are in London.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.465
This year, 45,000 people have
registered to compete in Code

00:00:17.465 --> 00:00:19.605
Jam, starting with a
qualification round,

00:00:19.605 --> 00:00:21.160
proceeding through three
online rounds.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.190
And the final 25 have
been invited to

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.024
the finals in London.

00:00:26.024 --> 00:00:30.417
The finalists will compete for
a prize of $15,000 and the

00:00:30.417 --> 00:00:34.020
title of Code Jam champion.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.200
The finalists this year are
going to be solving some

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.914
interesting problems.

00:00:37.914 --> 00:00:41.690
Some examples of problems from
past years involved four-armed

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.550
monsters sorting numbers,
grapple hook swinging ninjas.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.165
This year, one of the problems
is about finding a drummer for

00:00:49.165 --> 00:00:50.415
your rock band.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.450
PIEGUY: Hi, my name
is David Stolp.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.360
My handle is pieguy.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.780
I actually go by pieguy most of
the time, so I don't mind

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.320
if people call me pieguy.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.260
I'm here representing the United
States of America.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.530
This is my first Code
Jam finals.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:28.960
Woo-hoo!

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:29.500
VASYL: Hello.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.960
My name is Vasyl, and
I am from Ukraine.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.780
I believe this is my fourth time
at the Code Jam finals.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.770
STANIEK: I really like it
because it's something between

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.050
theory and practice.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.020
And I generally like both.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.570
JPAULSON: The coding
competitions are sort of like

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.760
the essence of what's fun about

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.800
computer science, I think.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.220
You get a very clean problem,
well defined.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.600
You get to figure out the
solution, code it up, and see

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.730
if you're right, all within
like an hour.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.370
So it's a very compressed
experience of what I find fun

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.400
about computer science.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.920
PO: Another great thing about
the Code Jam, which I enjoyed

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.270
very much as an alum, is that
it brings together the

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.479
finalists in a common venue
where they can exchange ideas

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.979
and often form partnerships and
friendships which extend

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.230
many years beyond.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.730
I will say that is one thing
that brought me back here to

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.280
go hunt for the Code Jam
in the London offices.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.860
This is a wonderful community
that you've created.
