00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.080
It seems like there might also be a ton
of other considerations if you're

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.240
thinking about hearing impairment,
visual impairment.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.964
When people are designing for all these
users can you compromise the design?

00:00:10.964 --> 00:00:14.193
Will the product maybe change too much?

00:00:14.193 --> 00:00:17.416
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a very good question and
there definitely does

00:00:17.416 --> 00:00:21.320
seem like there's a lot at first
glance to really consider.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.835
And in actuality,

00:00:22.835 --> 00:00:28.608
if you do leave all these considerations
to the end of the product cycle,

00:00:28.608 --> 00:00:34.194
it can compromise the product because
there's a lot of rethinking and

00:00:34.194 --> 00:00:39.708
refactoring that needs to go in,
to just kind of fit these things in.

00:00:39.708 --> 00:00:43.559
And so that's why we're always
asking people, and informing,

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.210
and educating people on how to
think of these things early on.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.370
I think when you just look at the
general steps within the design process,

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.195
all of the points that when you're
thinking about accessibility,

00:00:55.195 --> 00:00:59.378
they're integrated in every step
that you're already thinking about.

00:00:59.378 --> 00:01:00.758
So again, with color contrast,

00:01:00.758 --> 00:01:03.730
you're already thinking about what
is your color palette going to be.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.707
So, then just on top of that you have
some additional standards to maybe try

00:01:08.707 --> 00:01:13.291
to follow and look at to ensure
that there's enough contrast there.

00:01:13.291 --> 00:01:15.010
Hey, we're here at the OXO website.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.721
I wanted to bring this up because I
feel like they have a really good

00:01:19.721 --> 00:01:22.292
approach to universal design, and

00:01:22.292 --> 00:01:26.333
they have this great quote on
here that I wanted to read.

00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:30.172
When we talk about designing for
accessibility or universal design,

00:01:30.172 --> 00:01:34.530
it's important to note that that does
not mean designing products fully usable

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.376
by everybody,

00:01:35.376 --> 00:01:40.000
since there is no product that can
truly fulfill the needs of all users.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.890
But, when all users' needs are taken
into consideration in the initial

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:44.847
design process,

00:01:44.847 --> 00:01:48.828
the result is a product that can be
used by the broadest spectrum of users.

00:01:48.828 --> 00:01:51.904
So, I feel like that's a great
way to kind of sum up that, yes,

00:01:51.904 --> 00:01:55.290
there is a lot to consider, but
it's not about making compromises.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.651
In the end, when you do
consider these things up front,

00:01:57.651 --> 00:01:59.421
you end up with a better
product overall.

00:01:59.421 --> 00:02:01.279
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's great.

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:04.370
And how can an entrepreneur
learn more about accessibility?

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.836
What resources are available to them?

00:02:05.836 --> 00:02:09.900
&gt;&gt; The great thing is there's a lot
of resources out there online.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.738
A few just to kind of rattle off,

00:02:11.738 --> 00:02:16.283
are the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines, which you can find online.

00:02:16.283 --> 00:02:20.321
That's a really thorough list of
standards that you would want to meet,

00:02:20.321 --> 00:02:21.910
and need to meet.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.480
And they have great examples on
there as well, and resources.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.459
Different companies have provided
their own design guidelines.

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.270
Google is one of them,
which you can see here.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.932
This is the Google Accessibility website
and specifically these are our design

00:02:35.932 --> 00:02:41.087
guidelines that we came up with, which
are based on a lot of the standards

00:02:41.087 --> 00:02:45.923
that were developed by the Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines.

00:02:45.923 --> 00:02:51.710
Apple has a great resource as well, for
their accessibility design guidelines.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.234
And there's also some really
interesting tools out there.

00:02:54.234 --> 00:02:55.440
There's plugins.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.426
There's a plugin called SEE that allows
you to kind of simulate what your

00:03:00.426 --> 00:03:04.923
page or site would look like with
different vision impairments,

00:03:04.923 --> 00:03:07.650
as well as color blindness.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.607
Yeah, so there's a lot that's out there.

00:03:09.607 --> 00:03:10.107
&gt;&gt; Great.
