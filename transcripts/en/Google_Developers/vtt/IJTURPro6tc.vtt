00:00:07.232 --> 00:00:09.440
LAURENCE MORONEY: Welcome
to "Coffee with a Googler."

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.960
Today, I'm meeting
with Ankur Kotwal

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.220
to talk all about Google
Maps and great things

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.250
that you can build them.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.480
We'll even have a chat
about the Santa Tracker app

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.575
that Ankur worked on.

00:00:22.818 --> 00:00:25.014
Ankur, I've been a Maps
developer for a while.

00:00:25.014 --> 00:00:25.680
I love doing it.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.513
And almost every time
I go to anything Maps,

00:00:27.513 --> 00:00:29.020
I see your videos,
I see your blogs,

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.349
I see stuff that you've done.

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:31.640
So it's great to have you here.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.400
But tell us all
about Google Maps,

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.870
and what it is that
you do with it.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:35.661
ANKUR KOTWAL: Yeah.

00:00:35.661 --> 00:00:38.180
I'm part of the Google Maps
API developer relations team.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.662
And what we do is,
we are a conduit

00:00:39.662 --> 00:00:42.120
between third-party developers
and our internal engineering

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.810
teams.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.230
So as third-party developers
give us feedback on our APIs,

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.880
or they talk to
us about use cases

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.780
that they'd like
to see us address,

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.270
we take that feedback to our
product and engineering teams.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.660
They then take it, and
prioritize it, and start

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:56.955
to build those things out.

00:00:56.955 --> 00:00:58.580
And then we have a
team of tech writers

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.560
that write the technical
documentation that you

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.202
see at developers.google.com.

00:01:02.202 --> 00:01:05.129
We have a team of
engineers that actually

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.244
build libraries and samples.

00:01:07.244 --> 00:01:08.910
And in fact, they
like to see themselves

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.120
as the 0th customer of the API.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.620
[CHUCKLING]

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.490
LAURENCE MORONEY: Typical
engineer-- is the 0th customer.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:14.490
ANKUR KOTWAL: That's it.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.340
And so they get to have that
initial first feedback pass.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.390
And then we have developer
advocates like myself,

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.510
like yourself, that go in,
then tell the developers

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.260
that we've built this that
we've taken their feedback on.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.590
And then the cycle repeats.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.870
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.510
So it's great that
this stuff isn't just

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:30.530
built in isolation, right?

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.405
You've got folks like
yourself, who are there

00:01:32.405 --> 00:01:33.989
as that conduit
between the developers

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:36.404
and the outside world-- and
the engineers who are actually

00:01:36.404 --> 00:01:36.980
building it.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.541
But I hear you've got, like, a
little bit of an announcement

00:01:39.541 --> 00:01:41.040
of some new things
that you're going

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.380
to be doing in that space?

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.600
ANKUR KOTWAL: Yeah.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.150
So actually, to take that
relationship with the community

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.770
further, we've just recently
launched the Google Maps API

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.030
beta program at
developers.google.com/maps/beta.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.560
And what this really
is is a way for us

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.700
to get feedback on APIs
before we launch them.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.540
And for developers,
the advantage

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.230
is, they can see
the types of things

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.330
that we're working
on ahead of time

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.658
and catch us at that point
of our development cycle,

00:02:08.658 --> 00:02:10.449
that they can give us
feedback that's quite

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:11.622
meaningful and actionable.

00:02:11.622 --> 00:02:12.580
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.050
ANKUR KOTWAL: So we
can take that feedback,

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.870
make any changes to
the product, make sure

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.140
that at the time we launch
it, the quality is there,

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.420
but also its usefulness
is really there.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.655
So it's available-- it's
out now for sign-up.

00:02:23.655 --> 00:02:26.570
You know, we are looking to
take people in in batches.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.790
So if anyone sort
of hits the site

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.440
and sees that the
form is closed,

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.149
we will open it up
again at a later time.

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:33.273
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK, cool.

00:02:33.273 --> 00:02:34.500
So what was the site again?

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.345
ANKUR KOTWAL:
Developers.google.com/maps/beta.

00:02:37.345 --> 00:02:39.220
LAURENCE MORONEY: Am I
allowed to go sign up?

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.000
ANKUR KOTWAL: I think you
have special access already,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.499
Laurence.

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:41.999
[LAUGHING]

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:43.665
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Now, one of the things

00:02:43.665 --> 00:02:45.305
like with Maps that
I remember seeing--

00:02:45.305 --> 00:02:47.555
and I know it's a project
that you've been working on,

00:02:47.555 --> 00:02:49.350
and I've been dying to ask
you about it-- is the Santa

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.077
Tracker.

00:02:50.077 --> 00:02:52.160
You've been doing this as
a 20% project at Google.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.118
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah.

00:02:53.118 --> 00:02:55.530
It's a 20% project that's
a true labor of love,

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.030
because we work
throughout holidays,

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.780
and over the
end-of-year holidays,

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.490
and Christmas Eve
and Christmas Day.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.040
But basically, the reason
we love to work on it

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.540
is that it brings joy to
children and adults who

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.290
feel like children.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.790
And so, the point is that
throughout December, we

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.210
can play some games on our
website-- on the Android apps,

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.680
as well, we have some games.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.260
And then on Christmas
Eve, on December 24th,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.060
when Santa takes off, you
can track Santa's progress

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.710
through the world as
he delivers presents

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.260
and he stops by your
city, and so on.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.985
So we started working
on the Android app

00:03:31.985 --> 00:03:32.860
about four years ago.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.880
I was one of the
founding members of it.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.970
And I love contributing
to it every year

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.580
and just watching all
the reactions online

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.289
as people use it
throughout the holidays.

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:43.830
LAURENCE MORONEY: Now, does this
get you off his naughty list

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.270
and onto his nice list?

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.350
ANKUR KOTWAL: I hope so.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.940
[LAUGHING]

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.510
But no, it's just-- it's so
much fun working with him.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.590
Because when we put the
Android device on his sleigh

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.170
so that he can give us
his location, you know,

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.160
everything has to work.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.780
So we don't get
another shot at this,

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.770
and we don't even get
to delay our launches.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.680
So it is actually
a lot more pressure

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.490
than you would typically expect.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:05.140
LAURENCE MORONEY:
That's really neat.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.681
And actually, I did
have one question

00:04:06.681 --> 00:04:08.200
that inquiring
minds want to know,

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.610
as you are the Santa
Tracker expert.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.550
It's summer now--
(WHISPERING) where is he?

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:13.300
ANKUR KOTWAL: Where is Santa?

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.730
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.730
ANKUR KOTWAL: Well, he's
relaxing, for starters.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.170
Usually, we find that
he's relaxing on a beach.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.440
He's often hard to reach
at this time of the year.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.250
LAURENCE MORONEY:
He's earned a break.

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.041
ANKUR KOTWAL: Yeah.

00:04:22.041 --> 00:04:23.740
He definitely earns his break.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.700
But if you happen to go to
the Santa Tracker website,

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.710
or if you have a look
at our launch videos,

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.020
often, he's coming off some sort
of island, or like a cruise.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.320
It's funny-- for someone
that lives in the North Pole,

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.300
he enjoys warm weather.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.216
LAURENCE MORONEY: Ah, I
can't say I blame him.

00:04:38.216 --> 00:04:39.030
[LAUGHING]

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.850
Now, I hear you had a
really tough project

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.100
manager on this at one point.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.933
ANKUR KOTWAL: I did.

00:04:42.933 --> 00:04:45.130
It was my four-year-old--
or three-year-old son,

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.920
at the time.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.990
So I had a newborn and
a three-year-old son.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.720
And unfortunately, I told
my three-year-old son,

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.860
before my second son was
born, that I would build

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.820
a day-night cycle
in Santa Tracker,

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.116
so that when you touch
the sun, it would set,

00:05:00.116 --> 00:05:01.240
and the moon would come up.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.090
And when you touch the moon,
it would do the opposite.

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.800
At the same time, my
second son was born,

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.020
and so we were in and
out of the hospital.

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.940
But my three-year-old
son was relentless.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.410
He would say to
me everyday, Dad,

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.310
does the sun go down,
and the moon come up yet?

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.090
And so I spent
many an hour trying

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.610
to build this out for him.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.399
And it's the reactions
from people like my kids

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:27.190
that really drive me
towards Santa Tracker.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.610
LAURENCE MORONEY: That's
what makes it all worthwhile.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:29.430
ANKUR KOTWAL: Yeah, absolutely.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.125
LAURENCE MORONEY: But he
was a tough project manager.

00:05:31.125 --> 00:05:32.208
ANKUR KOTWAL: He is tough.

00:05:32.208 --> 00:05:33.170
He is really tough.

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:34.780
But he was happy
with the end result.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:35.350
LAURENCE MORONEY:
That's what matters.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:36.540
ANKUR KOTWAL: So I got
his tick of approval

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:37.440
at the end of the day.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.606
LAURENCE MORONEY: Very cool.

00:05:38.606 --> 00:05:40.120
Now, it's not just Maps, right?

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.630
Like in the Geo APIs, there's
a whole bunch of other stuff

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.030
that we can work with.

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.600
Can you tell us
about some of them?

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.391
ANKUR KOTWAL: Yeah.

00:05:46.391 --> 00:05:49.290
So typically, people
think of the Maps APIs

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.617
as the visualization pieces.

00:05:51.617 --> 00:05:53.200
But it's actually
much more than that.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.090
We have the sort of data APIs
through our web services.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.690
So things like
the Directions API

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.420
are immensely
valuable, where you

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.820
can get the step-by-step
directions from point A

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.930
to point B. Actually, more than
that-- you can add waypoints

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.080
as well, to say, I want
to get from here to here,

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.910
but I want to pass through
this, this, and this.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.210
And you can get it with
different modes of transport.

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.490
And then you can look at
ways to visualize that.

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.330
But these data APIs are
really, really valuable.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.710
They help you create
some magical experiences.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.770
The Places API is
another example,

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:25.960
where you can find out
about real-world places--

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.650
things like their opening hours,
things like their ratings, even

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:29.920
photos.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.710
But my favorite will
probably be the Roads API.

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.590
So something that we
don't often realize

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.010
about our mobile devices is
that the GPS sensors on them--

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:39.720
they're not always
very accurate.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:40.090
LAURENCE MORONEY: Uh-oh.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:41.548
ANKUR KOTWAL: So
even though you're

00:06:41.548 --> 00:06:43.320
driving along the
road or a path,

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.760
you'll find that the data that's
coming from your GPS sensor

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.260
is a little bit noisy.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.420
It's a bit of a zigzag
rather than a straight line.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.600
Now, developers came
to us and said, hey,

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.120
can you help us solve this?

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.370
Because we know that
the user is driving--

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:59.870
we know that they're on a road,
but we don't have a nice way

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:01.009
to represent this.

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:02.300
And so we built this Roads API.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.710
So you can submit a
bunch of latlongs to it--

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:06.200
latitudes and longitudes.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.787
And it will snap them to a road
and return them back to you

00:07:08.787 --> 00:07:10.120
and follow the path of the road.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.260
So it may even
insert more points

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.570
as you go through roundabouts
and things like that.

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:15.778
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice, nice.

00:07:15.778 --> 00:07:17.810
I've noticed that on the
East Coast of the US,

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:20.000
the freeways tend to
have service roads.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.110
So you can be on the
inside lane of the freeway,

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.150
and there's a service
road parallel to that.

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.300
And then sometimes
my GPS has me saying,

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.690
you're on the service
road-- get on the freeway--

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:28.500
and that kind of thing.

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:28.700
It gets confused
between the two.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:29.900
ANKUR KOTWAL: Well,
at least it's a road.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:30.750
LAURENCE MORONEY: That's true.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.680
ANKUR KOTWAL: Sometimes
you get GPS points

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.233
in, like, a field, right?

00:07:34.233 --> 00:07:35.534
[LAUGHING]

00:07:35.534 --> 00:07:37.075
And the Roads API
really helps there.

00:07:37.075 --> 00:07:38.280
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool, cool.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.196
You mention that you're
really excited by some

00:07:40.196 --> 00:07:41.970
of the innovative
ways that developers

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.465
are using Google Maps and
the various Google Maps APIs?

00:07:44.465 --> 00:07:46.215
Do you have an example
that you can share?

00:07:46.215 --> 00:07:47.006
ANKUR KOTWAL: Yeah.

00:07:47.006 --> 00:07:49.450
Actually, you know, right
now, one of the big topics

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:51.470
of conversation is VR.

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:53.330
And what I'm really
interested in

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.140
is VR as an educational tool.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:59.030
And so, when you start to take
Street View and put it into VR

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:01.180
and take that into
classrooms, and be

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:05.760
able to take young students
through the pyramids in Egypt,

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.870
through the Great Barrier
Reef, and show them

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.190
what it looks like, it's a
very different experience

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:13.130
to when you and I grew up, where
we'd look at pictures in books.

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:14.840
LAURENCE MORONEY: Draw a
triangle and-- passage here,

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:14.980
and--

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:16.030
ANKUR KOTWAL: Yeah.

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.670
And we had to use our
imagination a lot more.

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:20.977
But they get to see
what it's actually like.

00:08:20.977 --> 00:08:22.810
And I think that's
really, really wonderful.

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:24.510
LAURENCE MORONEY: I've seen
the Barrier Reef VR experience

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:25.230
that you mention.

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:27.730
And the one thing for me is
that it put it into context

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:29.380
just how precious it is.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:32.090
So when we talk about, like,
protecting the Barrier Reef,

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:33.840
it's when you see it
and you can feel it--

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.309
you feel more
emotionally attached

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:36.459
to wanting to protect it.

00:08:36.459 --> 00:08:37.250
ANKUR KOTWAL: Yeah.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.429
And, I mean, I hope
it stays as pristine

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:40.890
as it has been in the past.

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:42.990
But now we have a snapshot
of what it looked like.

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:45.800
And you can really
experience it.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.560
If you haven't taken
a Google Cardboard

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.490
and played with the Street
View app, you really should.

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:52.157
And the API enables
all of that, too.

00:08:52.157 --> 00:08:53.490
LAURENCE MORONEY: Great example.

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:54.279
Thank you.

00:08:54.279 --> 00:08:56.570
Now also, I know there's a
whole bunch of, like, helper

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:58.490
libraries to be able
to do some great map

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:00.620
scenarios, like polyline
encoding, and all

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:02.670
that kind of stuff for
Android developers.

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:04.550
Could you tell us a
little bit about them?

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.780
ANKUR KOTWAL: Yeah.

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:07.490
So we have this open source
library called the Android Maps

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:11.250
Utils, and it has a
number of features.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:14.100
I'm going to call out two
of my favorite ones, which

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.350
are different ways
to represent markers.

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:19.230
So often, you know, we
have markers on a map.

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.880
But sometimes, we're showing
lots and lots of data,

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:24.040
and different developers
deal with it differently.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.430
Sometimes they restrict
how many markers they show,

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:28.040
and they'll restrict
to a view port.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.539
But some visualizations
that you can

00:09:29.539 --> 00:09:31.970
look at are things
like marker clustering,

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:34.420
so that as you zoom out,
it will combine the markers

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:37.640
and represent it in some visual
way-- typically, a number.

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.160
And then as you zoom in, it
splits up and then populates

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.670
the markers elsewhere.

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:43.140
LAURENCE MORONEY: So if you
zoom far out from a city,

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.890
and you're looking, for
example, at restaurants,

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:46.200
there could be 1,000 markers.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.950
When instead of having
1,000 things drawn,

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:49.905
you're going to cluster
them into [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:49.905 --> 00:09:50.821
ANKUR KOTWAL: Exactly.

00:09:50.821 --> 00:09:53.510
Because there's no value in
presenting 1,000 markers--

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:55.240
LAURENCE MORONEY: There's a
big performance hit too, right?

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:55.380
ANKUR KOTWAL: Yeah.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:56.650
But how is the user
supposed to choose?

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:58.360
It's not meaningful
at that point.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.110
So marker clustering
really helps.

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:01.550
And the other one is Heat Maps.

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:04.220
So again, if you're talking
about things like restaurants,

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.580
you can start to see
hot spots in a city

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:09.190
as to where some of the
more popular or well-rated

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:10.230
restaurants are.

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:12.830
And maybe you want to
just sort of head there

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:15.190
and decide on the spot
as to which restaurant

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:16.599
you want to eat at.

00:10:16.599 --> 00:10:19.140
So Heat Maps are a really good
way to visualize that as well.

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:19.800
LAURENCE MORONEY: Wow, Ankur.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.258
I mean, there's
just so much things

00:10:21.258 --> 00:10:23.700
we've covered, from how
you're getting feedback

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.306
from developers to
the product teams

00:10:25.306 --> 00:10:26.430
so that we can build stuff.

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:28.590
And the new beta
channel-- new beta program

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:29.729
that you're opening up.

00:10:29.729 --> 00:10:31.270
Santa Tracker and
all this stuff that

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:33.180
was involved in that-- that's
like, that was hilarious,

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:34.264
and some good stuff there.

00:10:34.264 --> 00:10:36.013
And now, just all of
the different things,

00:10:36.013 --> 00:10:37.600
the different APIs,
the services APIs,

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.460
the Android libraries--
you're a busy man.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:40.626
ANKUR KOTWAL: You know what?

00:10:40.626 --> 00:10:42.420
It's the product that
really drives me.

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:44.365
The Maps API was one
of the first APIs

00:10:44.365 --> 00:10:45.990
that Google launched,
and it's actually

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:49.210
been more than 10 years
since we launched that API.

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:52.860
And we've seen such
innovative uses of Maps

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:55.075
on the web and even
in mobile apps.

00:10:55.075 --> 00:10:57.641
So I can't wait to see
where we go next with it.

00:10:57.641 --> 00:10:58.890
LAURENCE MORONEY: Sounds good.

00:10:58.890 --> 00:10:59.490
So thanks, everybody.

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:01.450
If you've any questions
for me, or if you've

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:03.590
any questions for Ankur,
just please leave them

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:04.660
in the comments below.

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:07.100
And don't forget to subscribe to
the Google Developers channel.

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:07.600
Thank you.
