Speaker 2:          00:26          hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab. We're talking about, well, what are we talking about? We're talking about sports games. Games. Yeah. You know what, what we're really talking about is a fundamental behavior of everyone on earth, including like wolves and cats, wolves and cats. I was with you broadening more than I would broaden, but that's, you know, well go in there. Come on. Like what a little bullets do. They don't play a football? No, but they tussled yes. You mean like, like they play? Yes. Like human babies. Yeah. Okay. Babies and young children spend almost all of their time playing seems so natural. We don't even think about it. So let's just go with that thought. This is Alison Gopnik. She's a developmental psychologist at the University of California at Berkeley. Big Sports Fan. Yeah. Baseball Oakland Fan. Professionally though, she studies kids and she's got an interesting idea. She says, if you look at kids, how they play over time. Yes. You see that at the center of their play. There's this really interesting tension that exists. Tension of what kind? Well, you can actually hear it. So we'll get back to Alison and just one moment. Here's a four year old girl named Rosa.

Speaker 3:          01:30          Yes. Listen to her. Describe her imaginary friend to her dad. And how does um, her mind, you know, Antarctica [inaudible] the moon. Um, what, what was she doing in the Antarctic in Antarctica? You know how she, what do you use to be boring? To Keep what? Warren, why don't she got lacquered? See I was scared for too long. How to skate and what prompted her to move from Antarctica to the moon. Okay. Don't one doctorals high and now she's thinking she wants to move back to me and talk

Speaker 2:          02:18          it. Preschool children, you start seeing this wonderful flowering of pretend play. The children are becoming Ninjas and princesses and superheroes at first says Ellison. This is what plays all about venting, making a crazy psychedelic connections, complete improv. You get this period. Just explore. Just innovate

Speaker 3:          02:39          came down from the team. We don't know spice host mice of course,

Speaker 2:          02:49          but if you fast forward just a couple of years, so not four anymore with six, six year olds, the vibe totally changes because now it's all about rules.

Speaker 4:          03:00          Just the freezer. Get the Taggart, the freezer tacky your routing yes. Taps you. Yeah. Okay. Actually brave is free

Speaker 2:          03:20          with six year olds. It just sounds really different. You hear a lot

Speaker 4:          03:24          this,

Speaker 2:          03:25          a lot of yelling about what's allowed, what isn't allowed.

Speaker 4:          03:30          Last time you started out with the ball.

Speaker 2:          03:33          In some ways I think the school age children are practicing being in a society, they're practicing having laws, they're practicing having rules.

Speaker 4:          03:40          I don't know yet.

Speaker 2:          03:42          Sort of, uh, developing a theory of sociologists. So you've got these two modes of play. You got the three year old inventor who's like, okay, I'm just going to make this happen. I'm going to create something new in the world. Then you've got the six year old enforcer

Speaker 4:          04:01          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          04:02          You can't just create what you want. The world is bigger than we are. We need rules. And one of the things that's really interesting about the games that seem to stick is that the greatest games like baseball are games that let us experience the world in both those ways at the same time. In other words, like a good game is a kind of weird, constantly shifting war between the three year old in us and that the six year old, I think she's probably correct because there are games which suffer from a lack of the tension she's describing this one game in particular. Okay. With that, I didn't know whether you've played it lately, but we heard about it from this Guy Brian Christian brighter. Yeah. Yeah. It was on a recent show talking about robots, but he also mentioned this little a moment. Yes, it's a moment.

Speaker 2:          04:49          So yeah, at the World Checkers Championship in Glasgow, Scotland in 1863 it is James Wiley against Robert Martins, the two best checker players in the world. Wiley Wiley playing a 40 game series, all 40 games opened with the same three or four moves and all 40 games were draws. Really? Yes. Not only that, 21 of the 40 games are the exact same game, meaning that move from move from move, they were precise. Duplicates of each other start to finish. Every single move was the same. Yeah. Yep. You know, can you imagine? It's like a month of checkers. How exactly does that happen? We'll see. These guys were professional checkers players. Yes. So they studied moves that other competitors had made. They would write them down and memorize them and they became a kind of catalog. So at, at a certain point, every move you saw on the checkerboard, you'd think, oh yeah. That one checkers had hit this point where the conventional wisdom about what was the proper move to play had gotten to this point where there was now basically a perfect game of checkers and with the world title on the line, both players played that perfect game over and over and over.

Speaker 2:          06:06          They stuck to the script. So this was really rock bottom for the checkers community. Yeah, so there you go. That's why no one plays checkers anymore. Some people play jackers I played, I played jackers. What? No you don't. Checkers is fine. As long as you don't play it for too long too. Well, you're a lame checker player. You could play checkers forever. Well then what's the point? I mean why would you play a game that's been gobbled up stead but by the way, this thing that you just said killed checkers. Yeah. This concept

Speaker 5:          06:35          has a name it's called called the book

Speaker 4:          06:43          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          06:46          The danger is that the entire game stays in book the whole time and that dangerous has, Brian is not specifically confined to checkers. Occasionally. Very rarely in the chess world you'll see two grandmasters play the exact same game that another pair of grand masters played, you know, a year before and they'll get booze and jeers all over the Internet and as a result now chess, let me, let me talk about chess. Okay. Chess. The book in chess is huge. It started in the 16th century and for hundreds of years players were keeping track

Speaker 5:          07:20          moves and counter moves and counter counter counter counter moves until by the 1950s

Speaker 5:          07:27          of course like to library. It actually was a library in the Moscow central chess club. And who's this? Uh, this is uh, Fred Friedl. He's a chess analyst and one of the few non Russians to have seen this room. Yes, the huge musty room. All these shelves and there were little boxes and the boxes contained little cards, index codes from each of these cards documented a particular game of chess from the past. And for awhile this was all a secret. There were about three or four players in the world, all Russian who had access to one. One of these guys had a big game. They would go to this library and say, all right, I've got this opponent, he's a Polish guy. [inaudible] something rather, give me all this game. And suddenly you have a few hundred cards which you and your team could study. This is how they prepared by memorizing literally thousands of moves, tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands. But where Fred comes in is in the 80s he convinced the Russian Federation to put this online where anyone could study it and add to it and suddenly this book explodes, which is for some people,

Speaker 2:          08:41          distressing people tend to boom me sometimes when I come into the trust tournament today, they will point to me and say, that's him Frederick the man who ruined chess because here's the modern game. When two players sit down at one of these tournaments to face off, they've already consulted Fredrick's database, which he's named Fritz Trust plays old call fritzy now and because of fritzy they walk into these games with so much of the book in their heads, that whole portions of the game are very checkers, like very rote. You'll see this if you watch grandmasters play speed chess, that's Brian Christian again. They'll just hammer out the first dozen or so moves, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam with barely any thought memory. Yeah, it used to be two, three, four, five, six moves. No big deal. Nowadays it is 16 moves, 20 moves. There does seem to be a kind of creep that's happening.

Speaker 2:          09:36          The book is getting bigger and bigger, but inevitably in every chess game there is a moment which puts the book in its place and if you watch a game, is there a chess tournament coming up that like a big one? Yes. Next Thursday I'm going to Romania where some of the top players are playing. If you watch a game as I was able to do, because you can watch these games online. Okay, yeah. We're going to watch a chess tournament online. You will see that moment. Yes. That's, it's not like, you know, Jordan's scoring 40 points while he has a fever and it's not like that, but if you know what to look for, it's quite profound. Okay. It's 8:30 AM I'm here with my little man. They high and somewhere in Romania, two grand masters are about to sit down at a table to do battle and I will watch it virtually the batch I watched with Magnus Carlsen, the world's top player versus a Kuru Nakamura, the u s champ. I call up Frederick. Hello Frederick to give me the play by play cause I actually don't know much about chess. Well his program Frisk can tell you how many times each move has occurred in the entire recorded history of chess.

Speaker 2:          10:45          What does that mean? It's like his computer can look at the board and say that that move you just made. That has happened before and I will tell you exactly how many times before it started. Here we go with one white moves, it's d for to d

Speaker 6:          11:00          white phone, two squares forward. My database tells me that there are 1,775,000 games in which this occurred.

Speaker 2:          11:08          Then we have two black counters with it's pond going from c four to east six. Now we've got two ponds facing each other, middle of the board, and according to Fred's database. This exact configuration has occurred in

Speaker 6:          11:19          514,518 games. A million and a half down to half a million smaller. Yes. Lose three white moves in other parts. 335,000 plants and another pond. 149,000 smaller moves. It's nice. 114,000 black moves, especially at 91,000 west. Again, white pontics of black bond just have our first casualty people. 2,428 games. What was that again? 2,400 Oh last time response. 2,613 games like the ship flies across the board. 2001 and 25 games. [inaudible] moves another pond up. 1,200 weight queen does a little thing where you 181 games 381 get lower. Yes. Black bishop retreats. 19 games, thank t one nine white lose another pond which has occurred in 11 games. Gay Black Bishop Retreats, 11 games. White Bishop advances. We've down to 10 game 10 woo black fish and falls back even further. And we have nine game. Black bishop takes white fish pies, game white pawn retaliates taking black bishop oh five game and then

Speaker 4:          12:28          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          12:28          white rook and white kings switch places.

Speaker 6:          12:31          No, there are no more games.

Speaker 2:          12:35          You have a position which has never occurred before. Indian verse

Speaker 6:          12:40          ever.

Speaker 2:          12:41          No. In the universe. Not In the history of this university and this is what is known as the novelty, the novelty, the novelty, you and in chest notes. If you read chess notes, you will see the charts after this move. The annotator writes out to,

Speaker 4:          13:08          yeah, out of book, I buy a book which means no more book. Both sides now are on their own

Speaker 5:          13:21          and everyone we talked to who plays chess told us that when you get to that moment and you feel you're alive in a way that you're not normally. That's Frank Brady, he's an author and a professor at St John's international harbor of the World Chess Federation. You're totally in it. Your mind is in some ways not even operating. It's like you're back to being three again. What are you saying? I'm saying this is one of the reasons we watch sports for these kinds of like zero moments position, which was never occurred. India the same time the zero is happening inside all of these rules which are like our lives. This is what else was saying. Games let us experience the world in both those ways. At the same time. The Pacers could fail. For example, here's one 1999 Nix Pacers. Larry Johnson has the ball, nicks are down by three final seconds. He has no shot best. You think he could do his tie but he has no shot. Yeah, and then somehow you twist the shimmies. He moved to the left, throws it up. It's fine.

Speaker 4:          14:21          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          14:21          that was like, what? What? I mean that's in the rules, but nobody could have imagined that position, which was never occurred. India, I don't know about. Never went. No mind you sure? Yeah. This is a hockey moment. It's Wayne Gretzky, early nineties he's playing chutes for the goal of the plaque. It's something somebody who starts flying through the air, like a tennis ball. When you get ski, turns around and lacks the flying out of the air.

Speaker 4:          14:50          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          14:50          to smacked it out of the air. The universe would have to be extremely old to have a previous version of that.

Speaker 2:          15:00          Frank, do you have a number one favorite novelty in chess? Well, my number one favorite would be Bobby Fischer's game of the century and went and when did that happen? We're jumping to 1956 Bobby is 13 years old and you see the Bobby Fischer of legend at this point, or just a 13 year old 13 year old kid. He got invited to this tournament. It was an all adult invitational tournament and frank says all the world's best were there. And this was kind of Bobby Fischer's first official match in the big leagues, so to speak. Exactly. And to set the scene, it was October warm Indian summer. We were at the Marshall Chess Club in Manhattan, which to speak Stodgy brownstone with lots of Mahogany. And Bobby Fischer in his t-shirt sits down to play a fellow named Donald Bern, a guy who looked apart a very urbane sophisticated jacket, bow tie, always had a cigarette between two fingers.

Speaker 2:          15:53          Imagine who had been hard for him to take this kid seriously and he was not doing all that well. From the beginning. Bobby Fisher was making what looked like dumb errors he was losing. For example, midway through the game, Bobby made this move where he moved as night to the rim of the board, which is usually strategically speaking is not the greatest place to move your night cause you know if your nights chuffed against the edge, it's boxed in and the night could be taken and people should watt. What is it that he blunder? Come on kid. Yeah, this is crazy. But then Bobby Fisher does something truly crazy. What he leaps so far out of the book and offense that people are still talking about this move. 50 years later on the 18th move, he allowed Byrne to take his queen. He just said, here, take my queen now in chess. That's like crazy. Yeah. In chess it's almost impossible to where the gay or if you lose your queen, it's like what? That's got to be wrong. That must be a stupid blunder that it seemed like maybe he was throwing in the towel. So a crowd gathers grumb of people hanging around to watch this kid get put in this place and Bern did what anyone would do in that situation. He took the queen, but maybe four moves later. Just at the moment you would think he would have Bobby Fischer in a stranglehold. Bobby started checking

Speaker 7:          17:10          king, he was chasing burn all over the board. People began to see that there was some combination, but it was a long combination and you know, 20 moves later burn was done. Both.

Speaker 2:          17:21          He was checked by [inaudible] and frank says if you analyze the game you see that it all began and in a way ended when he sacrificed as queen. What was the last game from that moment? Burn didn't take the queen. He was lost. This bird took the queen. He was lost the way. Are you saying he essentially checkmated him 20 moves at a time? Yes. It was unstoppable. It was forceful. So it's like he wrote a new book, he stuck the guy in his book. I love that. So it's Kinda interesting. You can start the game in book, so to speak and you're kind of locked into a set of moves. Yeah, the game ends kind of the same way. Same Way. That's destiny [inaudible] but then in the middle you just get a peak at something infinite, infinite. Although we were wondering like is that middle space really infinite by applying the rules?

Speaker 2:          18:09          I mean we asked Frederick if people play chess for hundreds and hundreds of years, venting new moves into that empty space. Would they ever fill it up? And he said no, because the number of chess games that are possible is vastly more than the number of atoms in the universe is a silly little number compared to the number of testing the numbers. How many alums either in the universe or what 10 to the power of 82 the last time I counted up, no, 78 82 zeros. 10 to the power of 78 I think 70 accurate and there are more. There's abilities within a 40 move chess game, 10 to the power of 120 approximately. And he says if he were to try to get all that information into fritzy his database, we would have to dismantle an entire solar system just to store the information. And he says you'd have to dismantle another one. Just to plug it in.

Speaker 4:          19:09          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          19:09          and what he says about chess, if you could say that about hockey, you could see that about baseball. You could say that about curling, but you can not say that about checkers. Like clear. So check inside. Every game has this kind of strange thing. It has a field of play, small little box. It'd be a board, it could be a field, whatever. And then you step into it and there's like a

Speaker 4:          19:34          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          19:35          I assume system

Speaker 4:          19:46          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          19:46          Thanks to Alison Gopnik, she wrote the wonderful book, the philosophical baby, and Frank Brady, who is the author of end game, Bobby Fischer's, remarkable rise and fall. And also Brian Christian who wrote the book the most.
