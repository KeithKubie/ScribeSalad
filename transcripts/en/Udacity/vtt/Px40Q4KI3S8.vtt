00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now if you answered, no, my brain hurts--well, who am I to argue with that?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
But I think the best answer is yes, it does in fact work.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Even though there's only 1 update wrapper call,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
both of them happen, and the reason is because decorator becomes a decorator.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So this version of decorator updates (seq), and then this version that gets created

00:00:20.000 --> 09:59:59.000
when we make it a decorator updates the decorator.
