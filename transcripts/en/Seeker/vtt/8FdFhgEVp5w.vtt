00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.840
The sun puts out a lot of energy, more of
it hits the earth in an hour than humankind

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.690
could use in a year And we’re really not
taking advantage of it, the US got less than

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.860
1% of its electricity from solar power in
2016.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.110
If we could get that number higher, we could
run our homes, cars, toaster ovens, all with

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.110
zero emissions.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.230
That’s the dream anyway, some perfect future
with limitless free energy.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.340
So what’s in the near future for this future?

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.360
Where does solar power go from here?

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.539
One of the big problems is what do we do when
there’s no sun?

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:31.850
Like on cloudy days.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:32.850
Or at night time.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.820
If we’re going to go all solar, we need
a way to store the sun’s energy.Usually,

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.650
we’d combine solar panels with rechargeable
batteries, but batteries are pricey and they

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:42.740
kinda suck.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.079
So researchers in Sweden are working on how
to catch the sun’s energy in a bottle, or

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:48.800
at least in a little tube.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.210
Those crazy Swedes developed a liquid with
an intriguing property.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.340
The molecules in the liquid react when exposed
to light and become isomers; meaning they

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.420
still have the same makeup, but in a different
arrangement than normal.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.690
This new arrangement stores energy, and when
a catalyst is introduced, it shifts the molecules

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.490
back to their usual structure and releases
the stored energy as heat, which could be

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.689
used to warm homes at night or generate electricity,
provided enough heat is released.

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:15.189
Recently the researchers switched from expensive
ruthenium to the more common elements carbon,

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:20.149
hydrogen, and nitrogen to build their molecules;
this makes the process cheaper and easier.

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:24.149
On top of that, they’ve actually increased
their storage capacity by a hundredfold!

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:29.069
Ok so... they could only store 0.01% of the
energy that hit it before... and a hundredfold

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:34.340
increase means just 1.1%, but still, progress!

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.679
Storage isn’t the only issue.

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:38.350
The panels themselves are also expensive…

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.889
If we could make the solar panels cheaper
that would go a long way to creating a competitive

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:44.939
source of energy compared to fossil fuels
and other renewables.

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.479
90% of photovoltaic cells today use crystalline
silicon, making them expensive to manufacture

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.270
and the process creates toxic by-products.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.130
But an entirely different approach does exist:
Using perovskites.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.039
Perovskites have a crystal structure of tetrahedral
arrangements of atoms and molecules, and depending

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:04.779
on which elements are used they have different
properties.

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:08.959
They could be superconductive, magnetoresistive,
or photovoltaic.

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.010
Solar cells that use them are cheap and easy
to assemble and could now be on par with silicon

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.319
cells in terms of energy efficiency.

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.879
But you may have noticed every rooftop in
sight isn’t covered in perovskites.

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:24.090
That’s because they have a fatal flaw: the
cells are unstable, and extreme light levels,

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.819
temperature, and humidity cause them to decompose.

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.940
Even normal weather can destroy them, which
is bad because you typically see a lot of

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.269
weather outside, the place where solar panels
need to be.

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.570
As a result perovskite cells only function
for several months, compared to silicon cells

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.159
which can last more than 25 years.

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:45.079
But hey, a decade ago perovskite cells only
lasted a few minutes.

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:46.700
Again, progress!

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.799
Scientists are constantly coming up with new
and ingenious ways to make the sun do our

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.140
bidding, and these are just a couple of things
currently in the works that show promise.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.579
Though we don’t use much of it now, breakthroughs
and innovation could lead to a world powered

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.849
cleanly and sustainably by sunlight.

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.930
The future of solar power looks bright.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.840
There are crazier ideas for solar like putting
panels in space and beaming electricity to

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.150
Earth, but a massive project like that would
be insanely expensive.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.209
They’re fun to ponder though, so Trace covers
some far our geoengineering projects here.

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.530
Do you have a favorite renewable energy technology
that’s not quite ready yet?

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.280
Let us know in the comments, so I can see
how many of you say thorium reactors, subscribe
