a consolidated view of what a superbug
is is a species of bacteria that we're

is is a species of bacteria that we're
 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.480
is is a species of bacteria that we're
familiar with that we're aware of that

bacteria that not only becomes resistant

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530
bacteria that not only becomes resistant
 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.950
bacteria that not only becomes resistant
to most of the antibiotics that are

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960
to most of the antibiotics that are
 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.750
to most of the antibiotics that are
normally used for it but that becomes

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760
normally used for it but that becomes
 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.869
normally used for it but that becomes
much more aggressive in terms of how

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879
much more aggressive in terms of how
 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.600
much more aggressive in terms of how
quickly it goes from an initial

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610
quickly it goes from an initial
 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.969
quickly it goes from an initial
infection to putting the patient in a

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979
infection to putting the patient in a
 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.850
infection to putting the patient in a
very precarious position so when those

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860
very precarious position so when those
 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.010
very precarious position so when those
kind of events happen that's when the

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020
kind of events happen that's when the
 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.750
kind of events happen that's when the
medical community i think is quite off

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760
medical community i think is quite off
 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.000

guard with respect to what it's dealing

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010
guard with respect to what it's dealing
 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.970

with and one of the challenges then is

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980
with and one of the challenges then is
 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.370
with and one of the challenges then is
what is that gap in time between when we

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380
what is that gap in time between when we
 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.650
what is that gap in time between when we
become aware of that problem and when

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660
become aware of that problem and when
 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.900
become aware of that problem and when
we're able to deliver a solution so yeah

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910
we're able to deliver a solution so yeah
 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.970
we're able to deliver a solution so yeah
there are things like that that keep us

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:30.980
there are things like that that keep us
 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.280
there are things like that that keep us
on our toes
