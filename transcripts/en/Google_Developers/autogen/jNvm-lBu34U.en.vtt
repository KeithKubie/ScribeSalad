questions from the audience and like I

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:11.360
questions from the audience and like I
 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.330
questions from the audience and like I
said keep it concise and let's get so

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340
said keep it concise and let's get so
 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.230
said keep it concise and let's get so
first question who's got a question all

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240
first question who's got a question all
 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.600
first question who's got a question all
right so the question is where's the

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:22.610
right so the question is where's the
 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:23.920
right so the question is where's the
hardware in all of this like are we

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930
hardware in all of this like are we
 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.230
hardware in all of this like are we
lagging behind on the hardware side what

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240
lagging behind on the hardware side what
 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.529
lagging behind on the hardware side what
do you see coming around the corner Don

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539
do you see coming around the corner Don
 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.130
do you see coming around the corner Don
is in the restroom he should answer this

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140
is in the restroom he should answer this
 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.439
is in the restroom he should answer this
I think and I think I effectively

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:35.449
I think and I think I effectively
 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:37.210
I think and I think I effectively
answered it here you go did you hear the

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220
answered it here you go did you hear the
 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.070
answered it here you go did you hear the
question it's about hardware one more

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.080
question it's about hardware one more
 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.890
question it's about hardware one more
time one more time Liz the questioners

in general ok well I mean you can hit

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229
in general ok well I mean you can hit
 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:06.190
in general ok well I mean you can hit
that now it's just really depends on

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200
that now it's just really depends on
 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.730
that now it's just really depends on
your application um so I mean it's there

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740
your application um so I mean it's there
 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.660
your application um so I mean it's there
you know you can boot up the FPS tracker

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670
you know you can boot up the FPS tracker
 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.940
you know you can boot up the FPS tracker
and actually see what you're doing and

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950
and actually see what you're doing and
 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.170
and actually see what you're doing and
you can certainly hit six FPS but yeah

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180
you can certainly hit six FPS but yeah
 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.999
you can certainly hit six FPS but yeah
I'm not really sure what we're getting

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009
I'm not really sure what we're getting
 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.179
I'm not really sure what we're getting
at here all right i'm going to add to

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189
at here all right i'm going to add to
 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.039
at here all right i'm going to add to
that I think Don already answered it

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049
that I think Don already answered it
 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.980
that I think Don already answered it
here's the thing any applicant any

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990
here's the thing any applicant any
 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.380
here's the thing any applicant any
application you write can run at one

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390
application you write can run at one
 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.840
application you write can run at one
frame per second I'm really good

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850
frame per second I'm really good
 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.480
frame per second I'm really good
hardware it's all about how you write

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490
hardware it's all about how you write
 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.929
hardware it's all about how you write
the software done spoke about it earlier

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939
the software done spoke about it earlier
 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:42.550
the software done spoke about it earlier
so yeah there's going to be some

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560
so yeah there's going to be some
 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.469
so yeah there's going to be some
sensitivities some devices are going to

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479
sensitivities some devices are going to
 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.139
sensitivities some devices are going to
run faster than others but in general I

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149
run faster than others but in general I
 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:48.760
run faster than others but in general I
think you need to perform its profile

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770
think you need to perform its profile
 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.190
think you need to perform its profile
for any device you're building for and

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200
for any device you're building for and
 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.739
for any device you're building for and
you can get 60 FPS on anything if you

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:53.749
you can get 60 FPS on anything if you
 

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:58.779
you can get 60 FPS on anything if you
build your application correctly all

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789
build your application correctly all
 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.859
build your application correctly all
right that's that next ten foot pole

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869
right that's that next ten foot pole
 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.489
right that's that next ten foot pole
anyway so yeah so the the question was

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:06.499
anyway so yeah so the the question was
 

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:10.920
anyway so yeah so the the question was
can you browse web GL content on the ps4

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:10.930
can you browse web GL content on the ps4
 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.230
can you browse web GL content on the ps4
the answer is no not at this current

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240
the answer is no not at this current
 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.010
the answer is no not at this current
time don't look at me like that

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020
time don't look at me like that
 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:30.090
time don't look at me like that
I mean you know obviously it's you know

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100
I mean you know obviously it's you know
 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.980
I mean you know obviously it's you know
we want to enable more and more for our

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990
we want to enable more and more for our
 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.300
we want to enable more and more for our
browser at this current time you know we

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310
browser at this current time you know we
 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.180
browser at this current time you know we
we don't enable WebGL for just general

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190
we don't enable WebGL for just general
 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.180
we don't enable WebGL for just general
things on the web that could potentially

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190
things on the web that could potentially
 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.690
things on the web that could potentially
change at some point in the future but I

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700
change at some point in the future but I
 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.440
change at some point in the future but I
can't really say when or where or why

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450
can't really say when or where or why
 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.800
can't really say when or where or why
that would be the case so you know kind

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810
that would be the case so you know kind
 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.740
that would be the case so you know kind
of figure I get this question but you

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750
of figure I get this question but you
 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.060
of figure I get this question but you
know very much apologize for my evasive

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070
know very much apologize for my evasive
 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.220
know very much apologize for my evasive
answer their question is has there been

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230
answer their question is has there been
 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.770
answer their question is has there been
much acceptance of the GL TF format and

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780
much acceptance of the GL TF format and
 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.330
much acceptance of the GL TF format and
the general web community so far right

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340
the general web community so far right
 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.580
the general web community so far right
answer no but there's a good reason for

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590
answer no but there's a good reason for
 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.860
answer no but there's a good reason for
that which is we're really not promoting

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870
that which is we're really not promoting
 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.130
that which is we're really not promoting
it too much yet I talked about into my

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140
it too much yet I talked about into my
 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.030
it too much yet I talked about into my
talks Fabrice mentioned it in passing

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040
talks Fabrice mentioned it in passing
 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.890
talks Fabrice mentioned it in passing
it's a new format in fact we have not

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900
it's a new format in fact we have not
 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.720
it's a new format in fact we have not
even published the specification yet but

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730
even published the specification yet but
 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.040
even published the specification yet but
we're doing all the work out in the open

the kind of format that you would do

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950
the kind of format that you would do
 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.830
the kind of format that you would do
with colada back in the day you get all

defining these ways to work with with
 

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:31.080
defining these ways to work with with
the web and WebGL is that we have a

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:31.090
the web and WebGL is that we have a
 

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:33.510
the web and WebGL is that we have a
great responsibility in doing so because

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:33.520
great responsibility in doing so because
 

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.400
great responsibility in doing so because
we will define how people will work it

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:35.410
we will define how people will work it
 

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:38.010
we will define how people will work it
and that means that we will define if

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:38.020
and that means that we will define if
 

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.960
and that means that we will define if
this will be a good thing if it will be

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:39.970
this will be a good thing if it will be
 

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:43.080
this will be a good thing if it will be
the next big thing or not but it's also

the next big thing or not but it's also
 

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:44.880
the next big thing or not but it's also
great responsibility it's what it is a

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:44.890
great responsibility it's what it is a

maybe it'll break on some browsers then
you fall back to something else canvas

00:16:39.789 --> 00:16:39.799
you fall back to something else canvas
 

00:16:39.799 --> 00:16:42.499
you fall back to something else canvas
something to d you have to redesign your

00:16:42.499 --> 00:16:42.509
something to d you have to redesign your
 

00:16:42.509 --> 00:16:44.059
something to d you have to redesign your
whole app because you can't rely on the

00:16:44.059 --> 00:16:44.069
whole app because you can't rely on the
 

00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:45.799
whole app because you can't rely on the
the new technology so we've been at

00:16:45.799 --> 00:16:45.809
the new technology so we've been at
 

00:16:45.809 --> 00:16:47.119
the new technology so we've been at
Google any way from working on

00:16:47.119 --> 00:16:47.129
Google any way from working on
 

00:16:47.129 --> 00:16:48.859
Google any way from working on
retrenching and really making sure that

00:16:48.859 --> 00:16:48.869
retrenching and really making sure that
 

00:16:48.869 --> 00:16:50.809
retrenching and really making sure that
that baseline is robust and we're almost

00:16:50.809 --> 00:16:50.819
that baseline is robust and we're almost
 

00:16:50.819 --> 00:16:53.960
that baseline is robust and we're almost
done with that big push so the next big

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:53.970
done with that big push so the next big
 

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:56.269
done with that big push so the next big
push will be finished the WebGL to spec

00:16:56.269 --> 00:16:56.279
push will be finished the WebGL to spec
 

00:16:56.279 --> 00:16:57.589
push will be finished the WebGL to spec
really get to work on the implementation

00:16:57.589 --> 00:16:57.599
really get to work on the implementation
 

00:16:57.599 --> 00:17:00.979
really get to work on the implementation
and I said this in a meet up early you

00:17:00.979 --> 00:17:00.989
and I said this in a meet up early you
 

00:17:00.989 --> 00:17:02.779
and I said this in a meet up early you
know a year ago or six months ago saying

00:17:02.779 --> 00:17:02.789
know a year ago or six months ago saying
 

00:17:02.789 --> 00:17:04.340
know a year ago or six months ago saying
wait six months and now I'm saying well

00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:04.350
wait six months and now I'm saying well
 

00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:06.769
wait six months and now I'm saying well
just wait another six months but we're

00:17:06.769 --> 00:17:06.779
just wait another six months but we're
 

00:17:06.779 --> 00:17:09.499
just wait another six months but we're
getting there and I think that the the

00:17:09.499 --> 00:17:09.509
getting there and I think that the the
 

00:17:09.509 --> 00:17:11.689
getting there and I think that the the
testing infrastructure will be much

00:17:11.689 --> 00:17:11.699
testing infrastructure will be much
 

00:17:11.699 --> 00:17:13.460
testing infrastructure will be much
better so that you can be guaranteed

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:13.470
better so that you can be guaranteed
 

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:14.899
better so that you can be guaranteed
that you're going to be able to deploy

00:17:14.899 --> 00:17:14.909
that you're going to be able to deploy
 

00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:16.909
that you're going to be able to deploy
the stuff immediately as soon as it's

00:17:16.909 --> 00:17:16.919
the stuff immediately as soon as it's
 

00:17:16.919 --> 00:17:28.069
the stuff immediately as soon as it's
turned on yeah I think it'll uh I'll

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:28.079
turned on yeah I think it'll uh I'll
 

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:30.529
turned on yeah I think it'll uh I'll
probably you know reach mid adulthood

00:17:30.529 --> 00:17:30.539
probably you know reach mid adulthood
 

00:17:30.539 --> 00:17:32.779
probably you know reach mid adulthood
and then need some coffee with milk and

00:17:32.779 --> 00:17:32.789
and then need some coffee with milk and
 

00:17:32.789 --> 00:17:34.519
and then need some coffee with milk and
I stay awake or something like that so

00:17:34.519 --> 00:17:34.529
I stay awake or something like that so
 

00:17:34.529 --> 00:17:37.279
I stay awake or something like that so
it'll do its own turbulent situations on

00:17:37.279 --> 00:17:37.289
it'll do its own turbulent situations on
 

00:17:37.289 --> 00:17:42.409
it'll do its own turbulent situations on
the GPU pretty sure pretty sure it'll be

00:17:42.409 --> 00:17:42.419
the GPU pretty sure pretty sure it'll be
 

00:17:42.419 --> 00:17:44.360
the GPU pretty sure pretty sure it'll be
doing its own turbulence simulations on

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:44.370
doing its own turbulence simulations on
 

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:47.600
doing its own turbulence simulations on
the GPU for its own milk and coffee yeah

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:47.610
the GPU for its own milk and coffee yeah
 

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:51.289
the GPU for its own milk and coffee yeah
that's what WebGL 3 is going to do
