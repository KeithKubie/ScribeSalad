00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:08.780
7 Amazing Facts from All Around the World

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:17.860
1) In the last century, the east coast of
the United States has moved about 8 ft. farther

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.130
away from Europe.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:25.789
2) In 1888, Nellie Bly (aka Elizabeth Cochrane)
discussed with her editor at ‘New York World’

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:31.550
an idea to write a story, and beat the fictitious
character ‘Phileas Fogg’ in Jules Verne’s

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.710
book “Around the World in 80 Days” by
actually accomplishing the feat in less than

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:36.710
80 days.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.440
The story became so big that competing New
York newspaper “Cosmopolitan” sent its

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.180
own reporter Elizabeth Bisland to race Nellie
Bly, by going in the opposite direction as

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.180
Bly.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.969
So on November 14th, 1889 Bly set off on a
steamer headed to Europe, while Bisland departed

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.090
westward from New York, on a 24,899-mile race
around the World.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.859
Bly beat both the fictional ‘Phileas Fogg’
from the book and Bisland for a total travel

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:08.380
time of 72 days, 6 hours and 11 minutes.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.039
Bisland reached four and a half days later,
both beating Jules Verne’s character Phileas

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:14.039
Fogg.

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:20.359
3) Mount Everest grows around 5-10 millimeters
every year thanks to the Indian subcontinent

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:22.189
pushing against Eurasia.

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:27.899
4) Considered one of the nation’s smallest
towns, Buford is located in southeastern Wyoming

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:34.600
between Cheyenne and Laramie on the Interstate
80 and consists of 10 acres with a convenience

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.999
store, gas station, and modular home.

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:41.969
The town was first founded during the construction
of the Transcontinental Railroad in Wyoming

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:47.609
and at one point boasted a population of about
2,000 people, mostly railroad workers.

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:52.739
However in 1980, when Don Sammons, first moved
in with his wife Terry and their son from

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:55.090
Los Angeles, they made up the whole population.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.149
After the death of his wife, Sammons bought
the entire town in 1992 and kept the lights

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.259
burning for longer than most expected.

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.770
He ran Buford’s only General/ Hardware/
Liquor Store and gas station.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.750
He was also considered the town’s mayor.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.620
His son moved away in 2007, making Don Sammons
the only resident of the town.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.750
In April of 2012, at age 61 Don decided to
retire and move closer to his son in Colorado,

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.540
putting the town of Buford up for auction
on Ebay.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.750
The online auction of the town created a lot
of buzz, with people from 46 countries reported

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.410
to have viewed and bid on it.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.920
In 11 minutes it sold to two Vietnamese buyers,
who had always dreamed of owning land in the

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.569
U.S.
5) Canada has over 3 million lakes, making

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.269
them home to 60% of the World’s lakes.

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.689
In other words, they have more lakes than
all other countries combined.

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:53.220
6) The East-African country of Uganda has
a population of over 35 million people.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.420
But the astonishing part is that, according
to the 2010 census, 48.4% of the population

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.120
is below the age of 15!

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.079
A mere 2.5% of the population was 65 years
and older, making it the youth capital of

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:08.260
the World.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:15.170
7) There is an ATM at McMurdo Station in Antarctica,
about 840 miles from the South Pole.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.480
Not surprisingly, this ATM is the most southern
ATM in the world.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.359
The most northern ATM in the world is in Longyearbyen,
Svalbard, Norway, which is about half way

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:29.560
between mainland Norway and the North Pole
(about 800 miles from the North Pole).

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.749
The world’s highest ATM is in Nagchu County,
Tibet and is about 14,800 ft above sea level.

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:41.069
Finally, the world’s lowest ATM is in Ein
Bokek, near the Dead Sea in a grocery store

00:03:41.069 --> 00:04:10.909
that is just shy of 1400 feet below sea level.
