00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.856
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.130
BEN RAWLENCE: Thanks
very much for having me.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.700
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.390
I'd like to tell you
about this refugee

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:19.010
camp called Dadaab, which is
the City of Thorns of the title.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.070
I spent four years
going to that camp,

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.010
following a range of
people who live there.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.470
Nine, whose lives are
documented in the book.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.100
And the book talks about
their ups, their downs,

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:40.230
their lives in this very
strange, limbo place.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.040
So I'll just pause for a minute
and let a couple of people

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.782
sit down.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.090
OK.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.800
So to get an idea of Dadaab,
what I'd like you to do

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.930
is to imagine a city of
half a million people.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.640
That's about the size of
metropolitan New Orleans,

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.600
or Zurich, or Bristol in the UK.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.880
And imagine a city like that
with no permanent structures,

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.590
with no sewage facilities,
with no running water,

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.190
with no sanitation, with no
proper roads, with no power.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.420
And imagine that
those people are not

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.410
allowed to leave the city.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.130
And imagine that they're
not allowed to work.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.140
What would that look like?

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.350
And the answer is it
looks a bit like this.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.980
It's stuck in the
middle of the desert.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.550
There are thorn
bushes all around.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.490
And after a couple of years,
when your tent disintegrates--

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.150
that you've been
given by the UN--

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.070
you're forced to cut
some of those thorn trees

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.424
down and make a little
house to live in.

00:01:51.424 --> 00:01:53.090
Because in the middle
of the dry season,

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.680
it gets up to about 45
degrees centigrade, which

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.220
is 105, 110 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.620
It's very hot.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.650
And in the rainy
season, of course,

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.830
the whole place
pretty much floats.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.460
Because this flat plain on
bedrock made of dust and mud,

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.510
when the rainy season comes,
all of that has nowhere to go.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.050
So everybody pretty
much drowns in water.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.200
And at the moment there is a
cholera epidemic in the camp,

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.540
because every rainy season
without the sanitation,

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.852
the disease just licks through
the camp like wildfire.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.300
The way that people
survive in the camp

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.530
is through food rations,
which all of us,

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.420
through our tax dollars
contribute to the United

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.510
Nations, pay for.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.120
And those food rations are
distributed every two weeks.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.000
And they constitute a portion of
rice, maybe some sorghum, maybe

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.480
some maize, maybe some beans,
and a little bit of oil.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.420
It's around 2,000
calories, which

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.052
are finely balanced
and finely costed.

00:03:00.052 --> 00:03:02.510
And the World Food Programme
distributes that to everybody.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.670
This city has been
there for 25 years.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.590
There have been people eating
those rations for 25 years.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.440
And they've never left.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.960
There are now
three generations--

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.430
two generations of people
who have been born there.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.910
So some people
came in the 1990s,

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.310
when the camp was
originally established

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.180
after the Somali civil war,
and their children have now

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.560
had children.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.060
So you have whole
generations that

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.190
have grown up without ever
seeing any other horizon.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.480
I'd like to tell you the story
of one man in particular.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.210
One of these nine who
I interviewed there

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.330
over the course of
four years while doing

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:45.790
the research for this book.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.390
And he's a young
man called Guled.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.800
He's now just over 20 years old.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.290
When I met him, he was 17.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.890
And he was born in
Mogadishu in 1993,

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.150
about the time that
Black Hawk Down happened.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.740
Those two American helicopters
that were shot down

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.500
in Mogadishu, which
brought to an end

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.670
the Bush/Clinton-sponsored
intervention in Somalia.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.010
And after that, the US left.

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.029
The UN left.

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:21.779
And Somalia pretty much had
no government up until now.

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:23.650
So Guled was born then.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.470
So his life is a
very interesting arc,

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.930
which pretty much mirrors
the collapse of Somalia,

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.590
and the rise of
this refugee camp.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.390
He grew up in Mogadishu.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.420
He scrambled around.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:37.520
He lost his parents.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.390
He found a living,
one way or another.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.900
And interestingly,
throughout this war,

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.510
he kept going to school.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.280
He kept going to a small
primary school in Mogadishu.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.980
And one day in 2010, in the
middle of the war-- every day

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:52.980
there's bombs going off.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.760
He's taking a different
route to get to school.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.770
And one day he goes to school,
and a couple of pickup trucks

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.810
show up, full of
al-Shabaab militants.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.180
Al-Shabaab is
allied to al-Qaeda.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.920
It's an extremist radical group.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.610
And at that point, they
controlled about 80%

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:11.320
of Somalia.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.380
Now they control a bit less,
but they're still a big force.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.960
So one day he's in class.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.511
These guys pitch up at
the back of the classroom.

00:05:18.511 --> 00:05:19.510
He looks at the teacher.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.180
He sees the teacher freeze.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.600
He knows something's up.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.920
He turns around, and he sees
these seven guys in the room.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.030
They take all of the
tallest boys in the class.

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.910
They blindfold them.

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.243
They put them in a pickup truck.

00:05:34.243 --> 00:05:36.590
And they take them
to a training camp.

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.190
For a month, he's
in a training camp.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:44.640
And he is being taught
to recite the Quran.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.370
He's being taught how
to handle a weapon.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.880
He's being taught
to-- eventually,

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.360
he's assigned to something
called the hisbat, which

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.580
is the police.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.420
The morality police
that al-Shabaab

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.910
used to make sure that the
people in the areas that they

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:05.800
control are abiding by the
Sharia law that they espouse.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.530
The elite group is called
the [ARABIC], which

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.040
is the suicide bombing group.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.960
And some of the kids, of course,
wanted to join that group.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.300
The ones who had volunteered.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.720
But the conscripts-- the
people who had been kidnapped,

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.920
like him-- were
assigned to the hisbat.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.690
So he was then he was then
sent out on these patrols

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.420
to police in Mogadishu.

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:32.620
After around a month,
he managed to escape.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:36.190
And he had-- funnily enough
for a 16-year-old kid--

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:37.520
he had a wife.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.670
Because in the
war, life is short.

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:43.490
And as a result of that,
people are increasingly

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.000
marrying younger and
younger and younger.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.480
And it's something we see in
poor and conservative societies

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.410
all over the world-- very,
very young marriages.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:53.800
He had a wife.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.080
When he escaped, he was too
scared to go to his wife.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.410
Because he was worried that
al-Shabaab would follow him

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.900
and would punish
the wife as well.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.610
So he called her.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:09.960
He said, I'm running away to
Kenya, to the refugee camps.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.860
And he left without seeing her.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.580
He got to the camp, after
this very long journey.

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.370
He had no money when he arrived.

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:21.340
He had one guy that he
knew who lived there.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.900
And through a complete
stroke of luck,

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.650
he managed to find that guy.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:28.930
And that guy showed him
how the camp worked.

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:30.990
He took him into his house.

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:32.890
He lived with this
friend of his,

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:36.740
called Noor, who's
also 16, 17 years old.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.770
And Noor showed him
how the rations work.

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:40.630
Showed him how to
get his ration card.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.430
How to register with the UN.

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:50.120
He showed him how
to try and work.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:56.060
Because after all of this time--
after making this journey,

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.740
getting to the camp,
living with Noor--

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.990
what Guled really wanted
to do was to phone his wife

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:02.720
and to tell her where he was.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.320
And to see how she was
doing, because still there's

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.200
a war going on in Mogadishu.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.590
He wanted to see
what was going on.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:12.710
But the principle challenge
of the refugee camp

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:14.470
is how to get cash.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.690
Because this is an
economy that operates

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:18.970
pretty much without money.

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:22.930
He was surviving
on the food rations

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:25.460
that his friend had been given.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.100
But his friend
didn't have a job.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.070
He couldn't get
any money, either.

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:32.159
So in order to make a
phone call to his wife

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:36.059
to tell her where he was,
the first day that he

00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:37.120
got his ration card.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:40.270
Went to collect his food
rations from the United Nations.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:41.620
He goes outside.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:45.320
He sells the rations for $2.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.750
Those $2 allow him to
go to the phone shop

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:52.310
in the market to make a
phone call to tell his wife,

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:53.676
I'm here in the refugee camp.

00:08:53.676 --> 00:08:54.175
I'm OK.

00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:00.824
He starts telling Maryam,
his wife, what it's like.

00:09:00.824 --> 00:09:01.365
There's food.

00:09:01.365 --> 00:09:02.300
There's shelter.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:03.440
There's peace.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.120
He's heard that maybe there's
the possibility of getting

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.190
resettled to the United States.

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:10.720
Maryam thinks, that
sounds quite good.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.370
The war here is pretty bad.

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:13.530
I want to come.

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:14.190
He says, great.

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:14.770
Great.

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:15.880
You can come.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.560
She says, but I don't
have the fare for the bus

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:22.670
to get from Mogadishu to Kenya,
which is around 400 miles.

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:25.040
You've got to send
money so I can come.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.960
So now he has another challenge.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.910
How does he get money to send
to Maryam to bring her there?

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:33.130
As I said, there's
no money in the camp.

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:34.150
People can't work.

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:35.310
There are no jobs.

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:37.560
Everyone's surviving
on these rations.

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.350
So he tries his
hand at portering.

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:41.900
There's a black market.

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.070
As you'd expect,
an informal city

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:47.950
like this-- after 25 years,
a black market has emerged.

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:49.980
There are some shops.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:50.970
There are buses.

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:51.710
There are trucks.

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:53.210
There are things going on.

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:56.020
There are phone shops.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:57.630
But he, of course,
is a new arrival.

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:58.950
He's not part of that.

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:01.460
So he starts trying
to do a portering job.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:04.940
He tries to carry rations
from the distribution site

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:08.040
on behalf of women,
family members who

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:12.780
are not very strong, who can't
carry these big sacks of food.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:14.210
But of course, he
can't lift them.

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:15.180
He's small.

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:16.810
He's a young guy.

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:19.280
He's desperately trying to
pick up these big sacks so

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:23.690
that he can earn $50, so that
he can pay the fare of his wife

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:25.980
to come.

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:28.600
To cut a long story short,
he doesn't raise the money.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.890
In the end, she borrows
the money in Mogadishu.

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:33.200
She comes and joins
him in the camp.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.530
And it turns out,
she's pregnant.

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:40.370
These two young people-- 17
years old, 18 years old--

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:45.404
embark on a new life
now in the refugee camp.

00:10:45.404 --> 00:10:47.070
He's told her all
these wonderful things

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:49.920
about how it's safe, and
how there's food, and so on.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.810
When she gets there, she has a
very different take on things.

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:55.400
It's really hot.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.500
She's pregnant.

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:57.640
She wants juice.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.240
She wants fruit.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.640
None of these things
are available.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.140
She's living in this
crappy stick house.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:07.650
She used to live in a
concrete house in Mogadishu.

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:10.880
The principal complaint that
I heard over and over again

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:15.530
from Maryam is, at least we had
a washing machine in Mogadishu!

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:17.400
In Dadaab, water's scarce.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.570
You have to line up
with 100 other people

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:23.030
to wait your turn at the tap
with your big yellow issued

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:26.670
jerrycan just to get the water.

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:30.740
So they have a very
difficult time.

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:34.740
Fast forward now four years.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:36.990
In the book is the story
of Maryam and Guled,

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:39.040
and how they
struggled in the camp.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.980
And how that struggle put
pressure on their marriage.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:45.280
And all of the different
things that emerged from that.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:49.660
But I'd just like to take you
up to the end of that story,

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:56.660
where after a famine; after
the Kenyan military invaded

00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:00.440
Somalia; after the breakdown
of law and order in the camp;

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:04.870
after police operations in
the camp, beating people up.

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:07.860
Guled running for his life from
the police again-- in Kenya

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.690
this time, not from
al-Shabaab in Somalia.

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:16.420
After all of these ups and
downs, we get to early 2015.

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:20.190
Guled and Maryam by now
have had two children,

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:22.890
and there's another
one on the way.

00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:27.880
And Guled is terrified
of going back to Somalia.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.550
He can't go back to Somalia.

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:33.670
The UN has just started
voluntary repatriation

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.970
back to Somalia, after
a lot of pressure

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:39.700
from Kenya trying to push
these refugees back home again.

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.560
Maryam thinks, finally.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:42.060
Yeah.

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:43.000
This is a good idea.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:43.880
We can go.

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.660
We can go back now.

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:47.930
But for Guled,
that's not an option.

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:48.650
He was kidnapped.

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:50.410
He remembers those
guys in black.

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:52.070
He remembers that fear.

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:55.410
He's worried about the
revenge from these people.

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:58.170
So they're a bit stuck.

00:12:58.170 --> 00:12:59.950
They don't really
know what to do.

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:02.790
They're having a
crisis in their family.

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:08.130
But Guled, this
dilemma that he's in,

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:10.770
precisely encapsulates
the dilemma

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:13.310
that everybody in
the camp is facing.

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:15.480
Because after 25
years, you're supposed

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.940
to have some kind of solution.

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:20.150
Some kind of future.

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:22.660
Some kind of hope for your life.

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:26.530
But he can't go back to Somalia.

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:29.870
He can't go down into
Kenya to claim asylum

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:33.040
in Kenya, because Kenya has a
road block south of the camp.

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:37.500
It doesn't let anybody
go into Kenya proper.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:41.660
And there are no slots
for resettlement abroad.

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:45.790
And this is the crux of our
current global refugee problem.

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:48.900
That once upon a time, you
went to a refugee camp.

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:51.060
It was a temporary thing.

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:55.560
And while you were there,
the rich nations in the world

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:59.720
would relocate, would
take quotas of people who

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:03.050
needed a safe place to stay.

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:06.440
And the refugee burden
would be shared.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.420
But we've got to
such a point now,

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:11.820
because that pipeline has
shrunk and shrunk and narrowed

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:12.680
and narrowed.

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.780
And the rich countries
don't want refugees.

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:17.430
They certainly don't
want Muslim refugees,

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:19.840
because of the
Islamophobia that has

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:26.720
been a feature of modern, rich
societies ever since 9/11.

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.350
That quota has got
smaller and smaller.

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:30.760
And as that quota has
got smaller and smaller,

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:35.490
these refugee camp populations
have grown and grown and grown.

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:38.760
And there are many, many people
like Guled, who are simply

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:43.550
stuck in these very, very
difficult domestic scenarios,

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:46.020
trying to-- as you can
imagine, refugee life

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:49.650
puts incredible
pressure on a family.

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:51.820
The difficulties for
the kids growing up

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:54.470
with very, very small
opportunities for them

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:55.530
to go to school.

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:57.250
With all of the
health problems that I

00:14:57.250 --> 00:15:03.060
talked about-- malnutrition,
cholera, and so on.

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:06.850
So this refugee
system is broken.

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:10.330
And I'll talk a little bit
later about ways in which we

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:13.040
could think about fixing it.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:17.290
But for Guled, I left him
at the beginning of 2015.

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:19.940
At the last chapter or
the end of this book,

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:23.750
I left him wrestling
with the idea of Europe.

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:28.520
And this is why Europe, for
people in sub-Saharan Africa,

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.440
is some kind of solution.

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.280
Or at least a dream
of a solution,

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.710
even though it's
expensive, even though it's

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:36.910
dangerous and difficult.

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:40.320
So he has no money, but he's
sitting with his friends

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.150
in the camp.

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:43.789
And he gets-- all of these
guys are in a football team.

00:15:43.789 --> 00:15:45.330
They're all friends
with each other--

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:48.370
they get a phone call from
one of their teammates

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:50.530
who made it to Italy.

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:52.800
Who spent probably
around $10,000

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.590
to get to Italy on one
of those leaky boats.

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:58.180
And he phones back to the
refugee camp and says,

00:15:58.180 --> 00:15:59.400
you got to come!

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.030
It's great!

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:00.920
There's work.

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:04.190
I'll send you money,
so you can come, too.

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:07.610
And he's selling them
this idea, even if it's

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:10.140
not quite as he's painting it.

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:12.010
That's the image
that's coming down

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:14.620
the phone line, that's getting
all these guys energized.

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:18.130
And for somebody like Guled, who
wants to look after his family,

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:19.430
he wants some kind of future.

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:21.350
He wants a chance to work.

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:26.950
Europe represents this
crazy idea of hope, at least

00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:29.790
some kind of future when
you can't go anywhere else.

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:31.190
You can't go back to Somalia.

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:35.260
Staying in the camp is
completely miserable.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.740
So when I left him, that
was the dilemma he was in.

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:40.650
That was the situation
he was stuck in.

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:45.280
Do I go to Europe without
money and try and blag my way?

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:50.390
Try and find some route
through Sudan, through Darfur,

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:55.640
through the Sahara, into Libya,
up onto the coast to Benghazi

00:16:55.640 --> 00:17:00.090
or places like that-- Misurata--
and then across to Italy?

00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:03.540
Or do I stick it
out in the camp?

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:05.240
See how I go.

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:09.160
Meanwhile, the food rations
have been cut by 30%,

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:14.440
because the UN has a crisis
with funding for Syria.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:17.460
So people in Dadaab are going
hungry, because there's not

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:19.710
enough food to eat.

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:22.140
Like I said, his
kids now are going

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:24.829
to have to fight for a
place at primary school.

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:26.200
There's cholera.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:29.150
It's not a good situation.

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:33.220
I recently checked
Guled's Facebook profile.

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:36.370
And on it, it says
he's from Ghana,

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:39.290
and he recently
visited Paris, France.

00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:41.590
And there's a photo of him.

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:43.590
His face Photoshopped
onto the body

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:46.870
of Wayne Rooney, the player
for Manchester United,

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:48.890
because he's a big Man U fan.

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:51.390
And his whole feed
on Facebook is

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:55.110
about Manchester United, and
pictures of Man U players,

00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:56.340
and so on.

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:59.860
He's living an
imaginary life online,

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:03.290
that is unavailable
to him in reality.

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:05.330
And if you look at a
lot of his friends,

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:07.340
a lot of the other people
I know in the camp--

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:08.910
they're all doing it.

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:12.510
You see people from Cincinnati,
Ohio; from Athens, Georgia;

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:14.280
from Stockholm, Sweden.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.280
And you see them in
front of the Eiffel

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:19.020
Tower in all these nice
clothes that they don't own.

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:23.380
But they've pasted their own
face on to these other images.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:25.970
So they're trying to lay
claim to these images

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:28.460
that they don't have.

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:32.660
And that gives you some sense
of the isolation of this place,

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:35.270
where-- they're in the world.

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:36.520
It's a bit like Zen Buddhism.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:39.114
They're in the world,
but not of the world.

00:18:39.114 --> 00:18:40.780
They're a product of
it, but they're not

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:42.770
participating in it fully.

00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:46.550
And they're kind of orphaned
in this limbo world.

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:52.180
So I've tried to give you a
brief portrait of the place

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:54.290
and some of the stories.

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:55.589
There are eight other stories.

00:18:55.589 --> 00:18:56.380
I've given you one.

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:58.200
There are eight
other characters,

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.550
people in this book.

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:03.811
And I'd just like to
pose some questions,

00:19:03.811 --> 00:19:06.740
to Google in particular,
but also to us,

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:09.230
as people who don't
live in a refugee camp.

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:15.730
Who participate in the
society of rich countries,

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:18.790
let's call it.

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:23.870
What does this mean for us, and
why should we think about it?

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:26.440
Firstly, I think it's important
to realize this is not

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.110
a European refugee crisis.

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:30.170
I was quite surprised
to see how it's always

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:32.910
represented in the American
media as a European refugee

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:34.460
crisis.

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:36.260
Whereas in Europe,
we see the newspapers

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:38.650
and it's the global
refugee crisis.

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:41.280
Of course, everybody's very
self-- very egocentric,

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:44.935
and that's how countries
like to see these stories.

00:19:44.935 --> 00:19:46.810
But it's important, I
think, to understand it

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:48.000
as a global refugee crisis.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.400
Partly because, as I said,
it's about this refugee quota

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.670
pipeline, the refugee
system that's broken.

00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:58.290
Which is why people
are going to Europe.

00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:00.540
They're only going to Europe,
because Europe's closer,

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:02.300
and Europe's cheaper.

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:03.760
Those who have
money are actually

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.720
paying twice the amount--
it's about $10,000

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:09.950
to go from Somalia to Europe--
to go to the United States.

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:13.080
The illegal route, via
Angola or South Africa,

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.940
into Latin America and
out through Mexico,

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:18.320
is around $20,000, $25,000.

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:21.350
But that is a route that
is growing, that people

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:23.640
are increasingly choosing.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:29.240
Plus, the United States,
Canada, other rich countries,

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.860
have a responsibility--
have UN responsibilities--

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:34.030
to share this burden.

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:35.460
And they're not
doing that, which

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:38.960
is why this pipeline is
blocked, and why people

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.434
are choosing to go to Europe.

00:20:40.434 --> 00:20:42.600
The other reason people are
choosing to go to Europe

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.450
is because the
Syrians are learning

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:47.750
from the Somali experience
that a refugee camp is not

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:49.750
a temporary thing.

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:53.490
They know, if we go there,
we're going to be stuck there.

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:57.420
And they're therefore choosing
to go the illegal route.

00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:59.390
So in order to stay
in a refugee camp,

00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:01.290
in order to keep
people there, they've

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:03.890
got to have some kind of
hope that that place is

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:05.390
going to be useful for them.

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:06.970
Either that they
can gain some skills

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:11.920
and experience while they wait,
or that it might be a departure

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.590
lounge for somewhere else.

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:16.560
And in the absence
of any kind of hope,

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.980
these individuals
manufacture their own hope,

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:21.840
which is partly what Guled's
Facebook is about and partly

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:24.010
what the book is also about.

00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:27.430
So understanding it as a global
refugee crisis is important.

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:30.495
And I think for corporations
like Google to understand

00:21:30.495 --> 00:21:34.920
is that we're now at 60 million
globally displaced people.

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:38.000
That's the same as the
population of Great Britain.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.240
And it's the fastest growing
population on the earth.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.960
If it was a country, it would
be a country the size of the UK

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.889
that's growing faster
than any other.

00:21:47.889 --> 00:21:49.930
Because of the numbers of
people being displaced,

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:52.770
and because of the birth
rate in these camps.

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:55.830
The birth rate in
Dadaab is 1,000 a month.

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:57.950
Now the US, to give you
some kind of perspective,

00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:01.630
takes around 1,000 people
from Dadaab every year

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:03.100
for resettlement.

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:06.340
There's no way-- the
UK takes around 100.

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:09.040
Sweden takes around
60-- there's no way

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:12.470
that that number is going
to go down while the camp is

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:14.860
reproducing as it is.

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:17.870
So globally,
collectively, we're all

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:20.740
going to have to bite
that bullet at some point.

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:25.270
Because the numbers of people
in these protracted refugee

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:27.210
situations are
growing and growing.

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:30.030
These cities in limbo
are growing and growing.

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:34.550
Of themselves, but also because
of these crises which don't get

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:36.550
solved-- Central
African Republic,

00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:40.290
Sudan, Syria, Iraq, and so on.

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:42.280
You've still got a
million people in Pakistan

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.910
from Afghanistan, from
all of those wars, that

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:46.320
are not going home.

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:51.010
So this limbo situation is one
that we need to understand.

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:54.190
And I think we
should think about,

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:57.330
both as a problem--
something which

00:22:57.330 --> 00:22:59.510
global citizens and
global corporate citizens

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:02.397
have a responsibility to try
and think about-- and also

00:23:02.397 --> 00:23:03.146
as an opportunity.

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:09.220
Mark Zuckerberg
promised to connect

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:12.197
all refugee camps in the world
within, I think, 10 years.

00:23:12.197 --> 00:23:13.030
Something like that.

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:15.390
He set a deadline.

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:19.690
And I think that
ambition is admirable.

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:23.420
I think it's great that
these communities should

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:23.990
be connected.

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:25.220
They need to be connected.

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:28.220
We need to somehow have a
way of relating to them.

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:31.080
They need to be integrated
into society, and also

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:33.540
into the economy.

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:36.270
But what do you do
with that connectivity?

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:37.770
That's the question.

00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:41.470
Because for the
moment, Facebook mostly

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:44.270
is just a wind-up
for these people.

00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:46.984
They're looking at all these
images that they can't have.

00:23:46.984 --> 00:23:48.900
They're being told about
these lifestyles that

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:50.950
are unavailable to them.

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:53.380
And it's really a
source of depression.

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:57.070
There's a word-- there's
a guy in the book who

00:23:57.070 --> 00:24:02.340
talks about this thing called
Buufis, which is actually

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:04.780
a condition that was
coined in the refugee camp.

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:07.370
It means a longing
for another life.

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:10.414
So you're kind of stuck in this
melancholy situation, where

00:24:10.414 --> 00:24:12.080
you don't like your
own life, but you're

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.090
wishing for another one.

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:16.160
So the connectivity,
in some senses,

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.150
can contribute to
mental illness.

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:22.350
On the other hand, it could
contribute to some positives

00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:25.250
for those people.

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:29.300
And this is where I think
it would be good for Google

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:30.790
to think about a
couple of things.

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:38.480
One of them is how do you start
incorporating those cities

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:40.820
in limbo with each other?

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:42.690
And how do you start
incorporating them

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:45.280
with the countries where
they're actually located?

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:47.960
Because these guys have almost
no relationship to Kenya,

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:52.650
apart from through the
truncheons of the Kenya police.

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:54.740
And then, how do you
start incorporating

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:57.010
those populations,
connecting those populations

00:24:57.010 --> 00:25:01.100
with the rest of us, in
the rest of the world?

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:03.290
In Kenya, they're
forbidden to work.

00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:04.740
But in Jordan, they're not.

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:06.770
In Pakistan, they're not.

00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:10.030
These are captive
populations of young people

00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:13.370
who would seize any opportunity
with an incredible amount

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:14.310
of zeal.

00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:20.950
So they are in the process of
doing online degrees, diplomas,

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:22.010
things like that.

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:25.400
There are some pilot projects,
where people in the refugee

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.310
camps are being employed.

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:31.270
They're being
outsourced to do jobs.

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:33.282
Something that I
thought about that I've

00:25:33.282 --> 00:25:34.990
talked about with some
people in the camp

00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:37.870
is trying to learn how to code.

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:39.590
Trying to learn
programming, so that they

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:44.430
could build basic software and
platforms within the camp that

00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:46.749
might make camp life better.

00:25:46.749 --> 00:25:48.290
That might solve
some of the problems

00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:49.415
that they have in the camp.

00:25:49.415 --> 00:25:52.130
That they could then use
that language or those tools

00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:54.026
to adapt to their own situation.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:00.130
Another issue is language.

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:03.240
Google Translate has been very
useful to a lot of the refugees

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:07.570
on that journey from Syria
and from sub-Saharan Africa

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:10.270
over into Europe.

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:13.330
But the European languages
are not-- in the camp,

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:16.820
the European languages
are not what they need.

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:19.400
You need Google
Translate for Somali.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:22.570
You need Google Translate
for Eritrean, for Amharic,

00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:23.670
for Oromo.

00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:26.050
For all of these other
languages that people

00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:28.560
are speaking in
the Horn of Africa.

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:32.096
And that would be massively
useful to those guys.

00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:37.270
The last thing is Street Map.

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:38.830
Street View, even.

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:41.920
Not only would it just be
really interesting to see

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.780
what the camp looks like.

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:47.170
But I can foresee all
sorts of applications

00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:49.080
for that kind of mapping.

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:53.670
That kind of very, very
specific imagery and specific

00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:57.590
GPS positioning, which could
be very useful for policing,

00:26:57.590 --> 00:27:01.900
for issues that they have
around sexual violence,

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:05.380
around pinpointing
water problems.

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:08.910
All sorts of stuff where that
kind of mapping technology

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:10.420
could be very useful.

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:13.419
I'm sure you guys could think
of all sorts of other things,

00:27:13.419 --> 00:27:14.960
based on all the
specialisms that you

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:18.170
do that I don't know about which
may be useful to this place.

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:21.940
But hopefully my role,
by just giving you

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:27.160
a flavor of this limbo of these
people who are stuck there,

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:30.260
and how the camp-- at least
a brief idea about how

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:33.660
this camp works, and what
it's like to live there--

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:37.230
you can imagine how that might
be relevant to your work.

00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:40.420
Or how your work might
be relevant to that.

00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:45.080
And the last point
I'd like to finish on

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:49.870
is that these numbers
are only going to grow.

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:54.360
And there's been some discussion
in the UK about climate change.

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:55.719
Perhaps more than here.

00:27:55.719 --> 00:27:56.260
I don't know.

00:27:56.260 --> 00:28:01.050
But the numbers that we're
seeing displaced by war

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:04.260
are going to be peanuts compared
to the numbers of people that

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:07.910
are going to be on the move
when whole swaths of countries

00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:09.380
become uninhabitable.

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:11.030
And that's not that far away.

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:12.890
That's maybe 20 years, 40 years.

00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:15.240
Certainly within our lifetimes.

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:18.200
Large numbers of people are
going to be moving, especially

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:19.490
from these parts of the world.

00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:24.192
From sub-Saharan Africa, where
it's already too hot, really,

00:28:24.192 --> 00:28:25.150
some parts of the year.

00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:26.150
And it's getting hotter.

00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:29.620
And El Nino this year is
then making it wetter.

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:32.660
So areas that have been
completely deforested

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:35.280
are incredibly hot
in the dry season,

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:38.070
and then literally
floating in the wet season.

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:40.700
We're going to see more and
more of those kinds of climate

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:41.710
refugees.

00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:45.720
And that is a lot more general,
and a lot less specific

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.390
than war.

00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:50.270
So we're going to need to
fix this global refugee

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:51.624
system that doesn't work.

00:28:51.624 --> 00:28:53.040
And we're going
to need to come up

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:54.820
with all sorts of
innovative solutions,

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:57.320
including technological
ones, that deal

00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:01.430
with temporary cities, and that
deal with temporary societies.

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:07.590
And connect people despite
all of these ideas of race,

00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:08.890
and nationality, and so on.

00:29:08.890 --> 00:29:12.200
All this nonsense
that divides us.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:15.790
Let me stop there, and let me
invite questions from anybody.

00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:16.450
Thank you.

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:23.455
Some here.

00:29:23.455 --> 00:29:26.890
AUDIENCE: Is there any history
of successfully converting

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:30.934
refugee camps into permanent,
functional cities that

00:29:30.934 --> 00:29:33.230
are healthy?

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:34.910
I guess by default,
in this case,

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:39.146
it would mean Kenya takes
all the refugees as Kenyans.

00:29:39.146 --> 00:29:41.770
But are there smaller instances
that have actually successfully

00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:42.730
made that transition.

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:45.210
So it's not about getting
out, but making the camp

00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:46.710
into a proper place to live.

00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:48.210
BEN RAWLENCE: Yeah.

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:49.510
There are.

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:52.770
Sometimes it's happened
sort of de facto,

00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:54.970
just because this place
has been there so long.

00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:57.710
So there's a town called
Kassala in southern Sudan

00:29:57.710 --> 00:30:00.420
which has been there
for about 50 years now.

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:03.830
And it's still predominantly
a refugee population

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:04.650
of Eritreans.

00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:09.830
But it's become its
own city, more or less.

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:11.750
Dadaab is going that way.

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:13.540
You have Gaza.

00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:17.240
You have the camps in Lebanon
in Beirut, which are now

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:20.060
pretty much suburbs of Beirut.

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:21.810
You have the West
Bank, of course.

00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:25.740
But the Palestinian situation
is sort of specific.

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:27.472
But it's becoming the rule.

00:30:27.472 --> 00:30:28.430
It's becoming the norm.

00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:30.180
It was supposed to be
a kind of exception,

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:32.300
but actually that's
the way it's going.

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:34.700
You do have examples
of-- there's

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:36.750
a town, I forget the
name, in Belgium--

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:39.910
that after World War
II was a refugee camp.

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:43.660
And it was leased
from a university.

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:45.230
And they took over
the buildings,

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:47.570
and it sort of grew and
grew and grew and grew.

00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:50.950
And the town council,
then, took on the mandate

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:55.990
of improving the-- I think the
university invested in the town

00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:59.550
and made the town,
grew the town.

00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:01.600
And then eventually,
after like 50 years

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:04.070
there was a lease process,
that they handed the town back

00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:05.750
to the city council.

00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:07.920
And then the city
council took it on again.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:10.500
So there are some
legal precedents

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:12.070
for doing things like that.

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:14.880
The main problem is not
so much the precedents

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:15.970
in the legal situation.

00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:19.470
The problem is the prejudice
of the Kenyan government.

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:21.390
The Kenyan government
doesn't want this place

00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:23.210
to become permanent,
because it doesn't

00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:26.550
want 400,000, half
a million Somalis,

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:28.810
getting Kenyan citizenship.

00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:32.070
So what you have to
try and work with is

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:35.740
acknowledge those fears, as
illegitimate as they may be.

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:38.730
And as illegal as they may be,
because if people seek asylum,

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:40.260
you have to grant
them citizenship

00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:41.330
after a period of time.

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:42.250
And that is the law.

00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:43.360
That is international law.

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:49.380
But most countries flout that.

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:51.395
So you have to
acknowledge that fear,

00:31:51.395 --> 00:31:52.770
and then you have
to try and work

00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:53.895
with the Kenyan government.

00:31:53.895 --> 00:31:55.690
And say, well, maybe
actually here there

00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:58.320
might be something to
benefit you in the end.

00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:59.980
And I can foresee
a model where you

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:03.750
had open cities that
were run by the UN, where

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:06.840
if you did insist on controlling
population movements,

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:07.820
you could do that.

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:10.650
But at the same time, you
could invest in the place.

00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:12.620
You could make it a
humane place to live,

00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:15.040
where there wasn't
disease, and hunger,

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:16.740
and all of these problems.

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:19.800
And possibly where people
could move between them.

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.780
OK, you don't want refugees
to come into Kenya.

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:22.410
Fine.

00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:24.240
But maybe they can
get on the plane,

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.460
and they can go to Mogadishu.

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:28.170
And then they can take
a flight to the UK.

00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:29.770
And they can visit
the UK with a visa.

00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:31.290
And then they can go home again.

00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:34.710
You know, if that home
is not so terrible.

00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:35.610
You know?

00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:37.990
Then you're subject to
the normal visa regime.

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:40.890
But I mean that's a
big leap of overcoming

00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:42.740
an awful lot of
xenophobia and racism

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:44.288
that we currently live with.

00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:49.301
OK.

00:32:49.301 --> 00:32:49.800
Sorry.

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:50.390
One, two, three.

00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:51.180
I'm just making a note.

00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:53.105
So I start with the back
and then come to you.

00:32:53.105 --> 00:32:54.085
AUDIENCE: And if you
could repeat the questions

00:32:54.085 --> 00:32:54.400
for the audience.

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:55.210
BEN RAWLENCE: OK.

00:32:55.210 --> 00:32:56.642
Yes.

00:32:56.642 --> 00:33:02.098
AUDIENCE: So I guess you talked
about xenophobia and prejudice

00:33:02.098 --> 00:33:07.060
and absorbing these
large populations.

00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:11.529
But I think there's
also the issue

00:33:11.529 --> 00:33:15.648
that a lot of world
strife happens

00:33:15.648 --> 00:33:20.468
because we get a
political boundary that

00:33:20.468 --> 00:33:24.510
doesn't match the cultural
boundaries within it.

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:27.360
So I think it's one
thing to say, well,

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:31.020
we'll take some
stream of refugees

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:34.860
that we can incorporate
into our society.

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:37.260
It's a very
different one to say,

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:42.330
we'll take 500,000
people en masse,

00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:45.300
which are then going to
potentially over time

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:47.775
become a destabilizing factor.

00:33:47.775 --> 00:33:51.975
So I guess I'm-- of course,
this is a horrible [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:51.975 --> 00:33:52.725
BEN RAWLENCE: Mmm.

00:33:52.725 --> 00:33:58.665
AUDIENCE: I'm just
saying that seems to meet

00:33:58.665 --> 00:34:02.431
a lot of extra [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:02.431 --> 00:34:03.180
BEN RAWLENCE: Yes.

00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:06.570
The question was about the
borders that don't necessarily

00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:08.510
match cultural borders.

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:11.409
And you may have communities
that exist in one state,

00:34:11.409 --> 00:34:13.600
but may have affinity
with another.

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:14.600
I mean, you're right.

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:18.020
The Kenyans' government is
in a difficult position.

00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:19.500
An unenviable position.

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:20.590
It's very hard for them.

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:26.090
If there were half a million
Scottish people in England,

00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:27.920
and Scotland was a
separate country,

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:29.850
and we didn't trust
them, and you know.

00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:33.636
I'm sure there would be all
of those sorts of issues.

00:34:33.636 --> 00:34:35.219
The point about the
border is correct.

00:34:35.219 --> 00:34:38.530
That there's a-- as I
deal with in the book.

00:34:38.530 --> 00:34:42.480
In fact, the border should
have been about 200 miles

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:45.409
further south, because that
population of northern Kenya

00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:47.260
was historically Somali.

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:50.710
And they wanted to join Somalia,
and the British said, no.

00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:52.719
We're going to give it to Kenya.

00:34:52.719 --> 00:34:56.659
So one of the guys in the
book, Tawane-- his grandparents

00:34:56.659 --> 00:35:00.780
grazed camels on that land
where the refugee camp now is.

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:01.920
And he's a refugee.

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:04.330
But actually, historically
it's his land.

00:35:04.330 --> 00:35:11.400
So you know, British colonialism
has a big can to carry.

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:12.770
And so do other countries.

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:13.810
It is difficult.

00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:17.209
But that's not to say that
we shouldn't try and overcome

00:35:17.209 --> 00:35:17.750
those things.

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:19.941
And we need to find
ways of incorporating

00:35:19.941 --> 00:35:20.690
these populations.

00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:23.040
Like I said, there are
going to be more of them.

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:26.210
So our idea of the
nation state might

00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:28.250
need to shift a little bit.

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:32.045
These myths of nationhood
are always pernicious

00:35:32.045 --> 00:35:33.560
and have long lasting effects.

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:36.770
But we now actually have
quite utilitarian reasons

00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:40.050
for unlocking them a little bit.

00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:40.550
Yes?

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:43.973
AUDIENCE: So are things better
or worse now than before?

00:35:43.973 --> 00:35:46.418
It seems like there's an
unprecedented refugee crisis,

00:35:46.418 --> 00:35:48.819
or it feels that
way, but is that just

00:35:48.819 --> 00:35:50.819
because people are surviving
now when they never

00:35:50.819 --> 00:35:52.286
would have before?

00:35:52.286 --> 00:35:54.025
500 years ago--
war is nothing new,

00:35:54.025 --> 00:35:55.730
so there's always
been really bad wars.

00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:57.327
But I seem like
500 years ago, you

00:35:57.327 --> 00:35:59.702
would have like, millions of
people displaced in the war.

00:35:59.702 --> 00:36:01.791
And then they
would just all die.

00:36:01.791 --> 00:36:05.230
There was no UN
giving them food.

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:07.009
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:36:07.009 --> 00:36:09.300
BEN RAWLENCE: I mean, I don't
know enough about history

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:12.210
to compare over the
course of many years.

00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:14.340
I mean, there were massive
population displacements

00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:15.460
in World War II.

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:17.970
That was the last time,
certainly, in Europe.

00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:21.090
And in East Asia, there
were big, big population

00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:22.640
displacements.

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:25.620
When people say that we are in
the midst of a global refugee

00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:29.450
crisis now, and they talk
about the figure of 60 million,

00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:32.410
that is the largest
since World War II.

00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:35.250
Because in World War II,
I'm not sure of the numbers,

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:38.740
but it was probably up there.

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:42.690
But what happened then was
you had borders being redrawn,

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:45.720
because of these refugees.

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:48.960
I think two million people
UNHCR resettled in Europe,

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:52.410
moving them around.

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:55.150
Is Europe and the United
States and other countries--

00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:57.780
are we now moving
two million people?

00:36:57.780 --> 00:36:59.870
Are we accepting them
from other countries?

00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:03.660
Germany has taken,
what, 800,000?

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:04.990
Which is unprecedented.

00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:08.050
But they have their
own political reasons

00:37:08.050 --> 00:37:09.180
for doing that.

00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:10.840
It's great.

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:13.400
But they are suffering from
a declining population.

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:15.060
They have labor shortages.

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:16.650
There is a big
political constituency

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:18.066
to accept those
people in Germany,

00:37:18.066 --> 00:37:20.540
which other countries
in Europe don't have.

00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:24.470
So we need a Marshall
Plan for dealing

00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:25.610
with the current crisis.

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:27.190
It hasn't come out of nowhere.

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:30.510
It has a long-- as I said, it's
been building for a long time.

00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:33.330
What's interesting,
or what's new,

00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:36.160
is the fact that only now
are we waking up to the fact

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:38.390
that there are all these
people who are displaced.

00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:41.612
And the only reason we've
woken up to it in the West

00:37:41.612 --> 00:37:43.070
is because they've
started arriving

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:44.580
on the doorstep of Europe.

00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:46.930
That's the only reason
it's in the media.

00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:48.530
I've been covering
refugee issues

00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:50.410
for 10 years with
Human Rights Watch.

00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:53.280
There's been thousands of people
dying in the Mediterranean

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:55.710
since 2000-- since 9/11.

00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:57.000
Even before.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.150
But it was never really a
news story, because it's

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:02.725
300 dead Africans in a boat.

00:38:02.725 --> 00:38:05.470
All of a sudden, it's
300 Africans in a boat,

00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:06.506
but hang on.

00:38:06.506 --> 00:38:08.380
There's a million who
are actually making it.

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:10.370
And now that's the story.

00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:13.590
So what's new is not the
refugee crisis as much

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:14.650
as the perception of it.

00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:16.270
The numbers are
rising, but they've

00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:20.280
been rising for a long time.

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:21.033
Yes?

00:38:21.033 --> 00:38:24.320
AUDIENCE: Two questions-- well,
one statement, one question.

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:27.040
I vaguely remember
reading at some point

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:29.980
that there was the
mapping of slums.

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:34.290
I don't know if it was-- it's
most probably a NGO that used

00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:36.090
Google technology to do that.

00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:38.580
But I remember they had used
local people in the slums

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:39.830
to actually start mapping it.

00:38:39.830 --> 00:38:45.550
And then it was useful both
to track the expansion of it

00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:48.920
but also useful for the
local population to see.

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:50.870
[INAUDIBLE] explain,
well, there's food here,

00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:53.800
and there's this there.

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:56.050
Second question
to you is, do you

00:38:56.050 --> 00:39:00.029
know if there is a plan
for those huge movements

00:39:00.029 --> 00:39:02.658
of population at some
point when there's going

00:39:02.658 --> 00:39:04.092
to be environmental problems?

00:39:04.092 --> 00:39:06.434
Or are there plans for that yet?

00:39:06.434 --> 00:39:07.985
Are people talking
about it actively?

00:39:07.985 --> 00:39:09.860
BEN RAWLENCE: First,
there are two questions.

00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:13.550
So first one was about an NGO
that used Google technology

00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:14.860
to map slums.

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:16.860
And the second question
was about whether or not

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:20.100
there are forward plans for
thinking about the refugee

00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:22.350
consequences of global warming.

00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:25.000
The first question, I
know of an NGO in Nairobi

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.220
called Spatial Collective,
who are-- shout out.

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:30.170
They're a fantastic
organization.

00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:33.950
And they've done this
mapping of slums in Nairobi.

00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:36.820
It would be great to see
that rolled out elsewhere,

00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:42.390
to see them partner with
other, bigger organizations.

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:45.030
And it's had very material
improvements in people's lives

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:46.580
in terms of their
access to services,

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:48.413
knowing what's going
on, that kind of thing.

00:39:48.413 --> 00:39:50.220
Because information
is the first casualty.

00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:53.930
And in a situation like that,
where the rumor is everything,

00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:56.470
and you hear that the
UN canceled rations.

00:39:56.470 --> 00:40:00.140
And all of a sudden, everybody
is saying that actually--

00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:02.902
or the UN's cut rations
by 30% and the rumor

00:40:02.902 --> 00:40:04.860
is that the UN stopped
getting food altogether,

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:07.050
and they want us to starve.

00:40:07.050 --> 00:40:09.280
So getting good
information is key.

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.250
The second point.

00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:13.800
Now, we're talking in terms
of global warming refugees.

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:16.110
We're talking decades
down the line.

00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:20.730
I wouldn't be surprised if
the CIA and MI6 and NASA

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:22.590
are starting to think about it.

00:40:22.590 --> 00:40:24.310
I wouldn't be surprised at all.

00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:27.020
I haven't seen those plans.

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:31.060
I'm pretty sure that
in some of the disaster

00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:33.820
planning for climate change
that that's been talked about.

00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:36.200
There's a renegade
scientist in the UK called

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:39.130
James Lovelock who has
talked about how the UK needs

00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:42.197
to prepare for big numbers of
refugees from mainland Europe.

00:40:42.197 --> 00:40:43.780
Because large parts
of southern Europe

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:46.040
are going to become
too hot, and people are

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:49.480
going to start moving north.

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:53.630
It's something we need
to start thinking about.

00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:54.130
Yes?

00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:55.921
AUDIENCE: I'm just
curious about UN funding

00:40:55.921 --> 00:40:59.553
in general, as this
refugee crisis grows.

00:40:59.553 --> 00:41:02.018
Does the UN see
themselves as responsible

00:41:02.018 --> 00:41:05.469
to ensure that these refugees
do not actually starve?

00:41:05.469 --> 00:41:08.427
And have you seen
any additional policy

00:41:08.427 --> 00:41:11.385
being made, more
in the recent days,

00:41:11.385 --> 00:41:12.864
in terms of how
to deal with this?

00:41:12.864 --> 00:41:16.068
And this is something that
every country's responsible for,

00:41:16.068 --> 00:41:20.199
not where this refugee problem's
happening at any given time.

00:41:20.199 --> 00:41:20.990
BEN RAWLENCE: Yeah.

00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:24.440
The question is about UN
funding and whether there's

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:28.058
been an increase in the response
to stop people starving.

00:41:30.846 --> 00:41:31.970
There has been an increase.

00:41:31.970 --> 00:41:33.570
But I mean, the
way that it works

00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:37.800
is that the UN is the
collective embodiment of all

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:38.660
of the members.

00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:43.459
And the member states are
the UK, my country, the US,

00:41:43.459 --> 00:41:45.000
all the other
countries of the world.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.590
There are standing
contributions to the UN,

00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:49.730
and then there are
emergency contributions

00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:51.320
whenever there's a problem.

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:57.130
So UNHCR, the UN Refugee
Agency, has a kind of budget

00:41:57.130 --> 00:41:59.990
that it draws down
from the general part.

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:02.030
But that's not enough.

00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:05.680
Which is why refugees
in Dadaab are having

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:07.870
their rations cut by 30%.

00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:09.370
And earlier in
the year, refugees

00:42:09.370 --> 00:42:13.640
in all of the Syrian camps also
had their rations cut by 30%.

00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:16.500
Because the UN could
not feed everybody.

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:19.700
So it seems to me
that-- and the way

00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:23.310
to fill that gap is for rich
governments to plug the hole.

00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:25.790
So I know that the British
government, for example,

00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:28.670
made extra donations
to the Syrian refugees,

00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:31.190
but nobody gave
money to the Somalis.

00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:33.980
Because they're forgotten
about, and they're not on the TV

00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:34.950
screens.

00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:38.280
And in this world of
imperfect democracy,

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:40.440
unfortunately
what's on television

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:43.300
is how the politicians respond.

00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:47.450
So in my view, all of
the nation-- all of us,

00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:49.160
who are citizens of
our nation states--

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:52.220
need to make sure that
our nation states remember

00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:52.810
everybody.

00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:55.570
And at the minimum
feed these people.

00:42:55.570 --> 00:42:58.190
You can't put them
in a refugee camp,

00:42:58.190 --> 00:43:00.350
forbid them from leaving
the refugee camp,

00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:02.230
and then not feed them.

00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:06.190
That's a crime on-- to me,
that's almost a war crime.

00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:09.230
That's a crime against humanity,
forcing people to starve.

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:10.225
And people are dying.

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:16.920
I'll take both questions and
try and answer them together.

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.054
Could you go ahead?

00:43:18.054 --> 00:43:18.840
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:22.235
Do you have insight into what
the standard infrastructure

00:43:22.235 --> 00:43:23.690
for a camp is?

00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:26.115
So let's say, if
the UN shows up.

00:43:26.115 --> 00:43:29.025
They set up tents, for sure.

00:43:29.025 --> 00:43:32.420
But then, what about water,
communication, et cetera,

00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:33.400
et cetera?

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:34.590
BEN RAWLENCE: OK.

00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:35.995
And the other question?

00:43:35.995 --> 00:43:37.578
AUDIENCE: I was
wondering if you could

00:43:37.578 --> 00:43:41.440
talk about the motivation for
disallowing work [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:45.247 --> 00:43:46.455
BEN RAWLENCE: Is that a hand?

00:43:46.455 --> 00:43:46.955
No.

00:43:46.955 --> 00:43:47.991
OK.

00:43:47.991 --> 00:43:48.740
The two questions.

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:50.940
The first one was about
the infrastructure

00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:52.785
of a refugee camp.

00:43:52.785 --> 00:43:53.660
What that looks like.

00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:54.740
How it works.

00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:57.130
And I suppose relatedly,
the second question

00:43:57.130 --> 00:44:04.460
was about the motivation for not
allowing the refugees to work.

00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:07.740
The refugee camp model is
something that's a little bit

00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:08.340
outdated.

00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:11.690
It was something that the
UN did a lot in the 1990s,

00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:14.390
when a host government had
a big refugee population

00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:15.900
and they couldn't cope.

00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:20.290
Like with Bosnia, with
Kosovo, with Rwanda.

00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:23.400
So Tanzania would say to
the UN, we can't cope.

00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:25.080
We need you to come
and set up camps.

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:27.550
We don't want to
allow that population

00:44:27.550 --> 00:44:29.580
to integrate into our society.

00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:30.968
We want you to
put them in camps.

00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:34.880
Technically, it's illegal.

00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:37.630
You're supposed to allow
refugees freedom of movement.

00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:40.000
But what happens
is the governments

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.600
find a way around it by
requiring movement policies.

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:45.340
A bit like apartheid
in South Africa,

00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:46.660
where you were in a camp.

00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:47.820
It's like a Bantustan.

00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:51.800
You need a pass to come out
and join the rest of the world.

00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:55.150
So they find these funny
ways of trying to regulate it

00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:59.010
and arguing that it's
legal, but it's not.

00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:01.520
But still, in
fast-moving emergencies,

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:05.460
the UN-- that is the only way
that you can look after people.

00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:08.440
If you've got 50,000
people who have just

00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:12.780
run from a town in South
Sudan which is burning,

00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:15.050
and they need food
and shelter and so on,

00:45:15.050 --> 00:45:17.410
a camp-- a temporary
city-- is the only way

00:45:17.410 --> 00:45:19.530
that you're going
to look after them.

00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:21.960
And then over time, of
course, they become permanent.

00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:25.220
But what that is is, yes,
as you say, it's tents.

00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:27.130
It's mobile hospitals
to start with,

00:45:27.130 --> 00:45:28.800
which then become permanent.

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:31.820
Over time, it's schools.

00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:34.260
Often boreholes to
bring the water in,

00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:35.910
or you're trucking water in.

00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:37.370
And then it's food.

00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:42.150
So in Dadaab, you still have
an emergency feeding situation,

00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:47.080
where you're shipping 8,000 tons
of food a month-- most of that

00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:50.720
from the United States, because
the US gives food aid in kind.

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:54.340
It doesn't give cash to
the UN for its own reasons.

00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:56.740
Because that's helpful.

00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:58.740
So that food aid
has to be shipped.

00:45:58.740 --> 00:45:59.840
Has to come up.

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:02.570
Travel three days by truck
into the middle of the desert

00:46:02.570 --> 00:46:04.130
in order to feed everybody.

00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:07.300
Your transportation costs
are about four times the cost

00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:09.590
of the actual food.

00:46:09.590 --> 00:46:12.210
If only we could
give them the money.

00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:15.400
But that is part
of US government's

00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:21.040
political decisions about
how it meets its obligations

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:24.560
and also benefits
its own citizens.

00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:26.190
There are all sorts
of contradictions

00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:29.000
in keeping these things going.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.440
So that's the infrastructure.

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:36.120
And after 25 years, or
40 years, or 50 years,

00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:38.650
some of those things have
evolved and some of those

00:46:38.650 --> 00:46:39.520
haven't.

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:42.770
The prohibition on
work is because it's

00:46:42.770 --> 00:46:43.830
an age-old narrative.

00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:50.170
In Britain, there's this
common political epithet.

00:46:50.170 --> 00:46:52.100
We don't want them
taking our jobs.

00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:54.600
There's this assumption
that immigrants and refugees

00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:57.110
take jobs from nationals.

00:46:57.110 --> 00:46:58.840
Generally, all the
economic evidence

00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:02.630
is that people create
more wealth and more jobs

00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:03.440
than they take.

00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:07.920
But for the
right-wing xenophobes,

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:11.250
that's an easy play to make.

00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:15.110
And Kenya believes very much--
to answer the second question--

00:47:15.110 --> 00:47:20.200
Kenya believes very much
that these refugees present

00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:24.060
a threat to the economic
prospects of Kenyans.

00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:26.070
Even though that's not the case.

00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:28.340
It's a politically
useful story to tell

00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:30.840
when you, as a politician,
are facing pressure

00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:33.840
for why you haven't generated
any economic opportunities

00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:35.170
for your people.

00:47:35.170 --> 00:47:37.110
Especially in an area
like northern Kenya,

00:47:37.110 --> 00:47:38.920
which is very marginalized.

00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:40.440
A lot of corruption.

00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:44.870
Leaders who, I
would say, haven't

00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:47.140
done their people very proud.

00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:50.040
Have not really looked
after their populations.

00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:54.370
It's very easy to blame all
the problems on the refugees.

00:47:54.370 --> 00:47:57.100
I probably got time
for one more, maybe,

00:47:57.100 --> 00:47:58.140
or two more questions.

00:47:58.140 --> 00:47:59.160
Are there any?

00:47:59.160 --> 00:47:59.963
Some here.

00:47:59.963 --> 00:48:03.940
AUDIENCE: So it seems
like maybe we're

00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:07.052
making the presumption of
more health than there is.

00:48:07.052 --> 00:48:09.385
But there is a huge amount
of work to be done in a camp,

00:48:09.385 --> 00:48:09.884
right?

00:48:09.884 --> 00:48:15.082
Just taking garbage and
sewage out from the latrines

00:48:15.082 --> 00:48:17.808
or living areas elsewhere.

00:48:17.808 --> 00:48:19.515
God knows where.

00:48:19.515 --> 00:48:20.390
Any sort of cleaning.

00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:23.250
Any sort of movement
of material.

00:48:23.250 --> 00:48:24.660
Does the work just not happen?

00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:28.100
Or is work within the
camp considered OK?

00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:30.910
Is there an organization
of labor within the camp?

00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:32.410
BEN RAWLENCE:
Well, increasingly,

00:48:32.410 --> 00:48:36.240
what's happening as the
budget is going down and down,

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:38.550
and the UN can't manage on
its own, what's happening

00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:42.780
is it's enlisting the refugees
as volunteers to run the camp.

00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:46.920
Now, on some level that's good.

00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:50.090
But on another level, you're
asking refugees sometimes

00:48:50.090 --> 00:48:53.470
to do technical
jobs, like teaching,

00:48:53.470 --> 00:48:57.699
like being water engineers,
like being sanitation engineers.

00:48:57.699 --> 00:49:00.240
And you're asking them to do it
without the proper equipment,

00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:02.050
without the proper support.

00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:08.700
So what happened recently was
that there was no sanitation.

00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:10.040
The UN just cut the budget.

00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:13.370
Said we're not paying for people
to collect rubbish anymore.

00:49:13.370 --> 00:49:16.000
And it just piled
up in the streets.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.310
And the sewage was everywhere.

00:49:18.310 --> 00:49:21.320
I mean, it's bad anyway,
but it got even worse.

00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:24.590
So the refugees
organized themselves.

00:49:24.590 --> 00:49:27.030
Because of the
prohibition on work,

00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:30.300
they're not allowed to be
paid like Kenyan workers.

00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:34.340
So instead they volunteer,
and they get paid a stipend.

00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:37.310
The stipend is
about $70 a month.

00:49:37.310 --> 00:49:40.210
So often, because you can't
get enough Kenyan teachers

00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:43.570
to go into the schools to
teach the people in the city,

00:49:43.570 --> 00:49:46.480
you're enlisting refugee
teachers who are working.

00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:47.880
They're not trained.

00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:49.780
They're working as
primary school teachers,

00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:51.700
secondary school teachers, even.

00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:53.550
And they're being
paid $70 a month.

00:49:53.550 --> 00:49:55.062
And they're next
to a Kenyan teacher

00:49:55.062 --> 00:49:56.770
who's being paid by
the Kenyan government

00:49:56.770 --> 00:50:00.570
and who is earning $1,000
or one and a half thousand,

00:50:00.570 --> 00:50:02.150
or something like that.

00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:05.430
So it's incredibly unfair.

00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:08.400
The incentives to
volunteer are quite low.

00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:11.850
But people do it when the
situation gets too bad.

00:50:11.850 --> 00:50:14.733
So it's very badly
organized, really.

00:50:17.855 --> 00:50:18.355
Yep.

00:50:18.355 --> 00:50:19.630
MALE SPEAKER: Last one.

00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:21.294
BEN RAWLENCE: OK, last one.

00:50:21.294 --> 00:50:24.000
AUDIENCE: The follow-up to
that question-- and this

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:27.198
may seem very uninformed,
but I'll ask it anyway.

00:50:27.198 --> 00:50:31.134
So let's say you do have
a village that flees

00:50:31.134 --> 00:50:33.594
and lands in another country.

00:50:33.594 --> 00:50:38.145
Do people just continue on their
professions within the camps?

00:50:38.145 --> 00:50:41.466
So for example, if there were
teachers in that village,

00:50:41.466 --> 00:50:44.910
can they continue or is
there not enough organized--

00:50:44.910 --> 00:50:50.234
does the camp organize itself
as it may have been in the past?

00:50:50.234 --> 00:50:51.900
BEN RAWLENCE: Yeah,
there's definitely--

00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:53.441
the question was
about whether people

00:50:53.441 --> 00:50:55.640
continue their old
professions in the camp,

00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:57.060
once they move there.

00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:59.240
There's definitely
an element of that.

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:02.380
But often, you
can't always find--

00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:05.116
there isn't the job to do.

00:51:05.116 --> 00:51:09.779
But there certainly is an
element of self-organizing.

00:51:09.779 --> 00:51:11.820
What would be great would
be if the refugees were

00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:15.150
empowered more to organize
themselves and to run things,

00:51:15.150 --> 00:51:17.470
and given the proper support,
and the proper budget,

00:51:17.470 --> 00:51:20.150
and the equipment, and so on.

00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:22.960
For example, there's a
community police force.

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:24.720
What they want
more than anything

00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:28.670
is boots, because you can't get
good shoes in a refugee camp.

00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:32.010
Everybody is either
barefoot or in flip flops.

00:51:32.010 --> 00:51:34.930
And the other thing they
want is two-way radios.

00:51:34.930 --> 00:51:37.750
Because they're all using
their own mobile phones.

00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:40.030
And they get given a
little bit of phone credit,

00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:43.240
like scratch cards, to
top up their phones.

00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:47.009
But often that's not enough,
or it runs out, or whatever.

00:51:47.009 --> 00:51:49.550
What they want is two-way radios
so that they can communicate

00:51:49.550 --> 00:51:51.460
about their patrolling.

00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:52.772
They don't have weapons.

00:51:52.772 --> 00:51:54.730
But if there's a problem,
they call the police.

00:51:54.730 --> 00:51:56.271
But in order to call
the police, they

00:51:56.271 --> 00:51:59.610
have to have a cell
phone with credit on it.

00:51:59.610 --> 00:52:02.490
So there's tiny things like
that that if you supported them

00:52:02.490 --> 00:52:04.844
properly and allowed them
to do their own thing,

00:52:04.844 --> 00:52:06.510
they could make the
camp a better place.

00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:12.100
I'll stop there
with the questions.

00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:15.100
But on the theme of making
the camp a better place,

00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:18.310
I hope that those of you
watching and those of you

00:52:18.310 --> 00:52:23.330
here might have some inclination
to think a little bit about how

00:52:23.330 --> 00:52:26.400
you might be able to help
make that a better place.

00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:28.480
Thanks a lot.
