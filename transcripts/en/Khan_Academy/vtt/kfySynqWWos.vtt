00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.890
We're told Ryan and
Sabrina are running a race.

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.987
Ryan runs 3 miles
every 17 minutes.

00:00:07.987 --> 00:00:09.320
And we see that right over here.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.160
This is Ryan.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.330
After 17 minutes,
he's run 3 miles.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.910
And Sabrina runs 5
miles every 29 minutes.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.160
And we see it right over here.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.930
After 29 minutes,
she has run 5 miles.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.870
The tables below show each
of their distance over time.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.080
Who runs at a faster rate?

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.590
Ryan or Sabrina?

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.350
So these are hard to compare
directly-- 3 miles every 17

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.230
minutes versus 5 miles
every 29 minutes.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.770
So what you want to do is
find a point on this table

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.740
where the ratios between
time and distance

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.420
are easier to compare.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.990
And the easiest
ones to compare are

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.080
when you have the
same numerator or you

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.312
have the same denominator.

00:00:48.312 --> 00:00:49.270
So let's see over here.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.270
Are there any points in
which the numerators are

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.080
the same or the
denominators are the same?

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.430
Well, it looks like over
here, it took Ryan 85 minutes

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.740
to go 15 miles, and it
looks like it took Sabrina

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.270
87 minutes to go 15 miles.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.500
So it took Sabrina 2 more
minutes to go 15 miles,

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.520
so she is clearly a
little bit slower.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.310
Ryan's a little bit faster.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.650
So Ryan runs at a faster rate.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.206
Let's check our answer.

00:01:19.206 --> 00:01:20.330
Let's do one more of these.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.210
These are a lot of fun.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.990
The following table shows
equivalent fractions to 9/100.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.490
Fair enough.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.110
The table shows equivalent
fractions to 99/1000.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.110
And then they ask us,
which fraction is greater?

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.100
9/100 or 99/1,000?

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.030
And this actually is not
so hard to compare even

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.910
without the tables.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.285
You could multiply the numerator
and the denominator here

00:01:42.285 --> 00:01:47.110
by 1,000, or by 10, and
you would get 90/1,000.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.860
And comparing that to 99/1,000,
and 90/1,000 is clearly

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:58.970
smaller, so you could say that
9/100 is less than 99/1,000.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.350
But another way to do it
is to look at the tables,

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.965
is to look at a point where
you have the same numerator

00:02:04.965 --> 00:02:06.290
or denominator.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.585
And you see that 9/1,000 is
the same thing as 450/5,000 And

00:02:11.585 --> 00:02:19.820
99/1,000 is the same thing as
495/5,000 So you have the same

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.800
denominator, but this
numerator is larger.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.810
99/1,000 is a larger number.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.440
And we mark that
right over there.
