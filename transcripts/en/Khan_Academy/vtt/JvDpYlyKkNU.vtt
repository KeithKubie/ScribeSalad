00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.400
The equation of a
circle C is x plus 3

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.340
squared plus y minus 4
squared is equal to 49.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.470
What are its center
h, k and its radius r?

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.210
So let's just remind
ourselves what a circle is.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.910
You have some point,
let's call that h, k.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.560
The circle is the set
of all points that

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.490
are equidistant from that point.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.550
So let's take the set
of all points that

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.380
are, say, r away from h, k.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.780
So let's say that this
distance right over here

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.940
is r, and so we want all of the
set of points that are exactly

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.060
r away.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.771
So all the points x comma
y that are exactly r way.

00:00:39.771 --> 00:00:41.770
And so you could imagine
you could rotate around

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.300
and all of these points are
going to be exactly r away.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.470
And I'm going to try my
best to draw at least a

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.760
somewhat perfect looking circle.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.590
I won't be able to do a perfect
job of it, but you get a sense.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.830
All of these are
exactly r away, at least

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.510
if I were to draw it properly.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.170
They are r away.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.319
So how do we find an equation
in terms of r and h, k, and x

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:08.540
and y that describes
all these points?

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.740
Well, we know how to find
the distance between two

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.610
points on a coordinate plane.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.820
In fact, it comes straight out
of the Pythagorean theorem.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.800
If we were to draw a vertical
line right over here, that

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.320
essentially is the change in the
vertical axis between these two

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.720
points, up here, we're
at y, here we're k,

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.200
so this distance is
going to be y minus k.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.625
We can do the exact same
thing on the horizontal axis.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.840
This x-coordinate is x while
this x-coordinate is h.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.060
So this is going to be x
minus h is this distance.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.610
And this is a right triangle,
because by definition, we're

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.780
saying, hey, we're measuring
vertical distance here.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.640
We're measuring
horizontal distance here,

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.500
so these two things
are perpendicular.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.510
And so from the
Pythagorean theorem,

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.860
we know that this squared
plus this squared must

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.040
be equal to our
distance squared,

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.340
and this is where the
distance formula comes from.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:18.530
So we know that x minus h
squared plus y minus k squared

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.430
must be equal to r squared.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.450
This is the equation
for the set--

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.120
this describes any x
and y that satisfies

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.607
this equation will
sit on this circle.

00:02:29.607 --> 00:02:32.190
Now, with that out of the way,
let's go answer their question.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.530
The equation of the
circle is this thing.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.075
And this looks awfully
close to what we just wrote,

00:02:37.075 --> 00:02:38.450
we just have to
make sure that we

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.033
don't get confused
with the negatives.

00:02:40.033 --> 00:02:43.620
Remember, it has to be in the
form x minus h, y minus k.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.510
So let's write it a
little bit differently.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.680
Instead of x plus
3 squared, we can

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.840
write that as x minus
negative 3 squared.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.340
And then plus--
well this is already

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.490
in the form-- plus
y minus 4 squared

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.310
is equal to, instead of 49, we
can just call that 7 squared.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.740
And so now it
becomes pretty clear

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.990
that our h is
negative 3-- I want

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:20.250
to do that in the red color--
that our h is negative 3,

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:26.500
and that our k is positive
4, and that our r is 7.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.460
So we could say h comma k
is equal to negative 3 comma

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:32.350
positive 4.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.100
Make sure to get-- you
know you might say,

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.558
hey, there's a
negative 4 here, no.

00:03:35.558 --> 00:03:37.540
But look, it's minus k, minus 4.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.850
So k is 4.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.917
Likewise, it's minus h.

00:03:40.917 --> 00:03:42.750
You might say, hey,
maybe h is a positive 3,

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.580
but no you're subtracting the h.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:50.328
So you'd say minus negative 3,
and similarly, the radius is 7.
