[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.850
SIERRA RAMIREZ:
Coming to the stage,

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.370
we have founder and CEO of
Daily Dress Me, Nina Vir.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.680
Fashion branding digital media
strategist, Ishmael Mayhew.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.780
Celebrity fashion designer
and tech innovator,

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.320
the designer of this stunning
LED dress I'm wearing,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.175
Dalia MacPhee.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.415
And experience design lead for
Jacquard by Google, Nina Walia.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.060
3D designer, entrepreneur,
digital sculptor,

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.440
and co-founder of
PicSuite, Janne Kyttanen.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.100
BRIA SULLIVAN: Hi, everybody.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.260
My name is Bria Sullivan.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.100
I'm a software engineer
here at Google,

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.030
and I am really excited to
moderate this panel of people

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.780
who have been able to
bridge the gap between tech

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.610
and their passion.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.110
Because I'm a
software engineer, I'm

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.040
very passionate about coding,
but I'm also a designer.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.540
I'm a very artistic person.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.630
And I like to think of
coding and all of tech

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.190
in general, as being a
canvas because you can--

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.310
with programming-- create
anything that you want.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.520
Everything that is on
YouTube and everything

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.310
that they've been
able to accomplish,

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.350
is because of innovators,
and programmers, and people

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.730
who are passionate about that.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:52.950
So let's get started.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.940
So can I first start
off with everybody

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.390
introducing themselves
and saying a little bit

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.750
about their background.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.200
You can start.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.150
ISHMAEL MAYHEW: So my
name's Ishmael Mayhew.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.289
I'm a digital media strategist.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.840
I also do a lot of coding.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.120
And I've always loved fashion.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.400
Fashion is actually a
very new industry for me,

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.050
but I've always
secretly been involved--

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.160
for a lot of reasons--

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.630
since I was a young kid.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.630
And so this is really full
circle for me, as well.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.210
NINA WALIA: I'm Nina, and
I'm the founder Daily Dress

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.090
Me, where we tell you what
to wear based on the weather.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.170
And this all works by using
our proprietary algorithm.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.810
And I started Daily Dress
Me when I was in high school

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.430
actually, and now I'm 23
and working on it full time.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.710
That's pretty much it.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.690
DALIA MACPHEE: Hi, my
name is Dahlia MacPhee,

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.301
and I'm the designer of
Sierra Ramirez's dress.

00:02:53.301 --> 00:02:54.800
I'm not sure if you
saw it, you have

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.620
to see it a little bit in
the dark, to see it light up.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.010
I own a clothing line,
mainly dresses and gowns.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.410
I started that 18
years ago so I'm

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.110
not going to tell how old I
was, but I was a little younger.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.990
And I started with 10
dresses actually, for prom,

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.000
and within one
year, the line was

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.480
in 1,500 stores and most
major department stores.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.200
But I always had a dream to
merge technology with fashion.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.360
14 years ago, I actually
launched the first light

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.890
up jeans in the world.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.450
Took them to Macy's
and Macy's said,

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.450
this is either going to be
our biggest hit or our biggest

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.710
flop, and in one month, they
were Macy's biggest flop.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:32.790
But I didn't give up.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.670
Every good idea has it's
time and obviously, today

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:36.330
was the time.

00:03:42.605 --> 00:03:43.230
NINA WALIA: Hi.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.490
I'm Nina Walia, and I am
experience design lead

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:47.510
for Jacquard by Google.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.009
I'll tell you a little bit about
what that means more later,

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:52.200
but Jacquard by Google,
what we're doing

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.405
is for making your
clothes interactive.

00:03:55.405 --> 00:03:57.030
Hopefully you guys
got to see the demo.

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.190
If not, come find me later.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.100
I've also done interaction
design or experience design

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.260
for Nike.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.570
I did the Nike Plus fuel band.

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.280
I did it for Public
Broadcasting.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.290
I used to work with shows
like "Sesame Street"

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.030
and probably all the shows
you guys grew up watching.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.089
And on this side, I love music.

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:21.569
I used to be a DJ, and
I'm a community organizer.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.666
JANNE KYTTANEN: So my
name is Janne Kyttanen.

00:04:30.666 --> 00:04:32.790
I have a very, very long
background in 3D printing,

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.780
especially, so besides
designing in 3D,

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.130
I'm sculpting and
doing my artwork.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.560
We also have a
venture capital fund,

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.690
and we design technology
organizations from scratch,

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:49.350
ourselves.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.680
And especially, within
did the real move

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.940
of cross-polanizing technology
like 3D technologies,

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.390
augmented reality, virtual
reality, sometimes fashion

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.600
as well, and trying to find
some new kinds of ventures

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.770
within these crossroads.

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.950
And PicSuite, if everybody had
some ice pops outside already?

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:12.960
[CHEERING]

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.050
Yes?

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.618
Did everybody like it?

00:05:15.618 --> 00:05:16.974
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:05:16.974 --> 00:05:18.890
JANNE KYTTANEN: So that
is a very good example

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.700
of the types of ventures
that we're busy with again

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.050
you might not imagine
creating a search engine

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.800
meeting 3-D printing
meeting food every day.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.820
So if anybody has some ideas
for a new kind of ventures

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:40.190
which are completely
crazy then let me know

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.360
BRIA SULLIVAN: Well, all of you
have really incredible careers.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.850
I was reading all of your
bios when they sent them to me

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:51.260
and every single one
was just mind blowing.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.920
But I'm sure you didn't
start there so how

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.140
has your profession
changed since you first

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.085
started your career?

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:01.900
ISHMAEL MAYHEW: Oh my gosh.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.290
For me, it's changed a lot.

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.240
The technology
industry, in general,

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.669
changes probably every day.

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:10.960
There's always new discoveries.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.380
It's like science.

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.150
It changes.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.030
And people need changes, and how
people live their lives change.

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.760
So that naturally happens,
and there's always

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.800
something different
that's thrown at you

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.930
and there's a new
problem to solve.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.820
But I also think
the overall makeup

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:30.880
of how any industry has changed
a lot since I've started.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.090
We hear this buzzword
of millennials a lot,

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:35.560
and millennials
have really changed

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.320
the face of what corporate
America looks like,

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:44.560
and how it operates, and how
young professionals are serving

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.865
their audiences or the world.

00:06:47.865 --> 00:06:49.615
BRIA SULLIVAN: I love
millennials so much.

00:06:49.615 --> 00:06:50.320
ISHMAEL MAYHEW: Me too.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.330
BRIA SULLIVAN: I will defend
millennials to the death.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:53.050
I love them.

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.260
NINA VIR: For me,
my actual profession

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.610
has changed a ton because
when I started my career,

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.860
I was in high school, and
this wasn't really a career.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.130
It was something I
was doing for fun.

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:07.840
It was literally,
something I made

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.940
for myself because every
morning, I'd wake up.

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.170
I'd check the weather.

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.690
And then, I decide what to wear.

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.880
And so over the years, it
grew really organically,

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.780
and now, it is my career.

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.930
And I think it's a
really interesting time

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:23.950
to be in between retail,
commerce, and tech.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:27.010
If you look around, so many
stores that I grew up with,

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:28.510
are now going
bankrupt and you're

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:30.910
seeing this new
crop of brands that

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:32.620
are really catering
to millennials

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.600
and our preferences.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.810
Customers have more choices,
more options than ever,

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:39.400
right at their fingertips.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.500
And the way that they're
being advertised to,

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:42.730
is very different now.

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:45.310
It's very native, very organic.

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:48.880
And so all of this is happening,
and it's just really exciting

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:49.810
to see how it evolves.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.310
DALIA MACPHEE:
Well I always say,

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:57.160
fashion is the last
frontier because I

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.610
feel like every other industry
has progressed so much--

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:04.000
you think of cars, and phones,
and yet, where's our fashion?

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.910
It should be doing so much
more, which, thank goodness,

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:08.230
we're finally getting there.

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:12.820
But 18 years ago, in the fashion
industry, our fashion shoots--

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.610
we were printing
catalogs on paper.

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:19.150
The photography was being
done by Hasselblad cameras

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:22.160
on real old school film.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.330
Some of our photographers know
that we were using drum scans.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:26.890
It was very expensive.

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:29.440
Now, obviously,
everyone can do--

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.840
not everyone-- but
professional fashion

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.780
shoots, it's like
you take the shoot

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.789
and tomorrow, you've got the
digital images out there.

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:39.010
So that's a big thing.

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:41.200
18 years ago,
there wasn't really

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.809
the volume of online
shopping that there

00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:46.570
is now, and then, information.

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:48.430
You really had to be
a fashion insider,

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:51.490
to know what was going to
be big the next season.

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:56.550
Now, we have to keep up because
you guys know before us, what

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.050
the next trend is.

00:08:58.050 --> 00:08:59.800
And then, I think the
last thing is really

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.660
being able to touch people--

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:05.552
touch the whole
world, pretty much,

00:09:05.552 --> 00:09:07.640
with the touch of a button.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.150
You come out with something
and everyone's able to see it

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:11.275
instantly, and that's huge.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.300
NINA WALIA: To that
point, my profession

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:21.480
didn't exist when I
started in my career.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.680
So after college, I went
to graduate school--

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.780
really super program
which was basically,

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:29.900
computers as an expressive
medium so doing really

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.420
cool creative stuff
with computers.

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:37.010
And we-- this was many years
ago-- and a bunch of us

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:40.400
got together and
made these costumes

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:44.090
that we programmed so
that the way you move,

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:46.010
could modulate sound and music.

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:49.460
So you could DJ with your
body and do a performance.

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.950
It was early days.

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:55.190
So we're doing all this stuff,
but my friends in my program

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:58.900
were like, yeah,
that's cool, but how

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:00.070
are you going to get a job?

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:01.528
What are you going
to do with that?

00:10:01.528 --> 00:10:03.350
And I was like, oh,
I guess you're right.

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:06.620
And at first, I was like, let
me do something practical.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:07.640
You're right.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.580
But then, like two
or three years later,

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:13.490
the Nintendo Wii came
out, the iPhone came out--

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:16.600
using the same
technologies we were using

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.410
to do all that modulation.

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:20.830
Do you guys know what
an accelerometer is?

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:22.680
Have you heard that word?

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.160
See, everyone knows
what it is now.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.250
When it started,
it wasn't a thing.

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:33.299
So I'm sure there will be
even more new stuff coming up,

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:34.590
as you guys are coming up, too.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.920
JANNE KYTTANEN: I would
answer that a little bit

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.450
in a different way.

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:47.590
Of course, in my last 20
years, last [INAUDIBLE] a lot

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:48.640
of things have changed.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.110
New technologies and
people express themselves

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:52.490
in different ways and all that.

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:56.390
But I would have advice
for everybody here--

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:59.570
all the younger crowd--

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:02.930
don't be entertained,
but be the entertainer.

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:05.180
So when I was at
school 20 years ago,

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:08.214
I was the only kid at
school who had a computer.

00:11:08.214 --> 00:11:10.130
And of course, I was
fighting against a system

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:13.220
and we had these old tools and
everybody was drawing by hand.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:17.090
And I was told by my
peers, that, quote,

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:20.690
that thing-- computer--
will kill your creativity.

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:25.370
And I said, yeah, and you're
going to be so unemployed.

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:28.340
So again, to that note,
be the entertainer.

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:30.950
And to all the YouTube stars
here, in today's world,

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:33.410
it's a lot easier than when I
was growing up 20 years ago.

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:35.284
We didn't have YouTube,
and it was a lot more

00:11:35.284 --> 00:11:36.517
difficult to get out there.

00:11:36.517 --> 00:11:38.600
And to your point, we
didn't have online shopping.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.220
Any of these things.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:42.020
So all these thoughts
are available

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:46.132
so really, really go
out there and kick ass.

00:11:46.132 --> 00:11:47.090
BRIA SULLIVAN: I agree.

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.830
Did you have a plan for
success when you first

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:55.860
started your career--

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:56.700
I'll start with you.

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:59.158
We've been starting on this
end so we can start on that end

00:11:59.158 --> 00:11:59.730
this time.

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:01.790
JANNE KYTTANEN: If I had a plan?

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:05.120
I only had one plan,
which is to find happiness

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.430
and also, everybody said
in the previous panel,

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:10.940
about there's a lot of talk
about passion, try to find

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:12.920
that inner core, trying
to find your passion

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:15.620
and really stay true to that.

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:18.440
And if you find that, it's
going to be a lot easier.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.890
You don't actually have to work.

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:21.620
You don't have to worry about
anything because you're happy

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:23.990
every single day,
working on what you love.

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:26.660
BRIA SULLIVAN: What I
will say, that people--

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:29.132
especially when I
was in high school--

00:12:29.132 --> 00:12:31.340
I was passionate about some
weird things or whatever,

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:35.330
but I still didn't know
exactly where I was going,

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:39.020
and I think I want to
reiterate that that's OK

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:40.250
if you don't have a passion.

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:44.270
You don't have to force
passion on yourself.

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:46.850
There are people well
into their 40s and 50s,

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:50.090
that don't discover
what they wanted to do

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:51.470
or what their passion was.

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:53.510
It's not something that
you can just look up.

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:58.490
It's something that the
universe presents itself to you.

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:01.760
Sorry, go on.

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:05.240
NINA WALIA: I think I'll say
two things about my plan.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.040
One is, I'm a child
of immigrants.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:11.000
My parents came over from
another country and yeah,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.586
they had their education,
but that doesn't always

00:13:13.586 --> 00:13:14.960
mean a whole lot
when you show up

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.740
and you look really different.

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:21.410
And so I came up watching
my parents hustle

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:27.530
so hard to get us to where we
are, and watching that, to me,

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:28.950
there was no other choice.

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:31.320
It's like there is
success or what else?

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:32.760
Because they worked so hard.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.110
I watched that.

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:38.590
And I was just going
to carry that on.

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:40.400
So that's one part,
and the second part

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:47.110
is, part of watching that, put
that like practicality in me.

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:49.750
It's like dreams, but
also, I need a paycheck.

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:55.450
So what I've realized is,
I could be in any industry

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:57.080
through technology.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:58.890
So as I was mentioning
to you guys before,

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:01.450
I've worked in
media and TV shows.

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:03.550
I worked at Nike,
which was awesome

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:06.480
because I was a sneaker-head.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.950
I work in fashion now.

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:11.540
Everything you can imagine--
every industry-- they need

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:15.220
is technological things.

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:20.740
So you can be anywhere,
using that knowledge.

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:24.990
So I think that was a
major part of my plan,

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:28.940
I'm going take this practical
skill set and be wherever.

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:35.260
DALIA MACPHEE: Well I think
because I started so young,

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.560
everyone is saying passion
which, obviously, is huge,

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:39.670
following a dream.

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:40.720
That's huge as well.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.030
I grew up riding
and jumping horses,

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:44.780
and anytime I was
afraid, my trainer

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:46.780
would always say, throw
your heart over the jump

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:48.440
and follow it.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:53.290
But I really think, the first
year, my collection blew up

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:55.870
and people always said,
well, how did you do it?

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:59.890
I had no fear because I hadn't
been tainted by the world yet.

00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:01.360
That's the honest
truth so I hope

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:05.800
you guys hear this because
you're so powerful right now.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:09.340
Don't let anyone tell you
who you are or what you can

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:10.780
or cannot do.

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:11.650
I had no fear.

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:13.780
I believed I could do anything.

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.760
And so nothing held me back.

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.580
And had a dream,
and I had a passion,

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:19.975
and I guess that was the plan.

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:26.110
NINA VIR: For me,
that was great,

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:27.280
and I totally agree with it.

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:30.520
Because I started young, as
well, and a lot of people

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:33.165
are so surprised when they
hear that, but for me,

00:15:33.165 --> 00:15:34.290
I don't know any different.

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:37.740
And I think I was almost
naive, in a sense,

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:41.770
and I was daunted by the world,
either, because I hadn't really

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:42.650
seen it.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:46.750
And I'm still young
now, too, so I still

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:48.940
can be a lot more
bold than people

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:51.100
who have to support
a family or have

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:53.170
all these responsibilities.

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:56.650
But as far as when I was in high
school and starting my career--

00:15:56.650 --> 00:16:00.790
I guess-- I didn't have a
specific plan for success.

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:02.450
I didn't think of it like that.

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:06.160
But what I did think about
was, what did I enjoy doing?

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.430
What was I good At and how
could I combine those two things

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:10.690
into a career?

00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:14.660
And if I was able to, I knew I
would consider that a success.

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:18.050
And so I was always
very creative.

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:20.560
I knew I wanted to do
something on my own.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.820
I was very intrigued
by entrepreneurship.

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:25.690
And so, I guess, marrying
all those three things,

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:28.720
is what I would have considered
to be a success, at the time.

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:42.270
ISHMAEL MAYHEW: I
have never had a plan.

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:43.790
I still don't have a plan.

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:46.580
I've always clawed my way--

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:49.250
I've always had a goal,
and so I've always

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:52.670
spent my life setting
milestones and having a vision.

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:59.180
I remember Darren and John
saying, seeing yourself there,

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:01.370
no matter what
circumstance you are in.

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:05.329
And some of you are already
tainted by the world.

00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:11.720
You guys are facing unimaginable
trials and circumstances.

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:15.260
I did when I was this age, and
I was raised by my grandmother.

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.770
And there was never
really a plan for my life

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:21.170
because the plan wasn't to
be raised by my grandmother.

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:25.790
So I've always set milestones,
and I've always clawed my way

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:27.260
to where I wanted to be.

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:31.760
And always, set a vision for
how I wanted to see my life.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:35.510
And that always changed,
too, because you

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:37.070
get inspired by new things.

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:39.140
And I don't want
anyone in this room

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:44.390
to feel married to any industry
or even any vision to yourself.

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:45.920
Just know what you want.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:49.040
I love what you said, you
just wanted to be happy.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:52.160
I think that's one of the
most important goals anybody

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:55.925
could ever ask for, is
just to choose to be happy.

00:17:55.925 --> 00:17:58.760
And be good to people,
and be good to yourself.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:02.627
And think of ways that you can
use your gifts and your talents

00:18:02.627 --> 00:18:03.710
to give back to the world.

00:18:06.575 --> 00:18:08.158
BRIA SULLIVAN: Yes
that was beautiful.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.540
One word that you
used, milestone, that's

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:16.550
one of my favorite words.

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:19.940
Because goals and dreams
and stuff can sometimes

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:22.730
be arbitrary, but I feel
when you have milestones,

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:24.320
it doesn't feel
like it's the end.

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:25.730
It's almost a stepping stone.

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:28.540
Sometimes people view
goals as that's the end.

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:30.650
Now I got here, now what?

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:31.630
So I like that.

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:34.040
But I think you did have a
plan to get to each milestone,

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:36.339
right?

00:18:36.339 --> 00:18:37.880
ISHMAEL MAYHEW: I
kind of had a plan.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.380
I just figured
things out as I went.

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:41.088
BRIA SULLIVAN: But
you got there, though.

00:18:41.088 --> 00:18:42.269
ISHMAEL MAYHEW: Yeah, I did.

00:18:42.269 --> 00:18:44.060
BRIA SULLIVAN: I was
listening to a podcast

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:48.080
and I heard something that
said, a goal without a plan

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.610
is just a wish.

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:54.000
And I was like, read me.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.890
So the next thing--

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:59.930
we only have, like
what, 15 minutes left?

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:02.190
I'm going to go over because
the last person went over

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:02.731
so I'm sorry.

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:11.970
If you had to pick
one thing, what

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:16.770
has been a major highlight
of your career, thus far?

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:19.819
ISHMAEL MAYHEW: The major the
major highlight of my career,

00:19:19.819 --> 00:19:21.360
I guess, isn't
anything career-based.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.820
Just any time I
hear someone tell me

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:26.730
that whatever I've done in
my career or in my business,

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:30.210
has positively impacted them
and motivated them to get up

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:32.280
in their darkest
moments, I think

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:35.940
that is a highlight for me.

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:38.820
NINA VIR: Whenever I get emails
from my users who tell me

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:41.850
about how Daily Dress Me
has made their lives better

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:43.980
and streamlined their
morning routines--

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:47.754
it's always really touching,
and I love receiving those.

00:19:47.754 --> 00:19:49.170
DALIA MACPHEE:
Well, I'm Canadian,

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:51.570
and I was honored by the
Consul General of Canada

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:54.810
a few years ago, and that
was a big deal for me.

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:55.560
Felt very proud.

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:58.626
Felt like I was
representing my country.

00:19:58.626 --> 00:20:00.190
NINA WALIA: That's awesome.

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:02.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:06.180
I always have two-part answers.

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:09.480
One, my highlight is
always the latest thing

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:14.130
that I did so right now,
it's our jacket with Levis.

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:16.920
So you can go get this right
now in any Levi's store--

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:19.080
well, most Levi's stores.

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:19.980
And it's interactive.

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:21.280
It's pretty cool.

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:25.020
And then, kind of similar
to what you were saying,

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:27.420
I got to work with
Michelle Obama's office

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:31.440
on a digital campaign to
help kids be more active,

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:35.886
and that always
feels super good.

00:20:35.886 --> 00:20:38.256
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:44.640
JANNE KYTTANEN: I would say
the proudest thing for me,

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:47.070
would be the next thing
that I haven't done yet.

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:50.520
So I don't really like
reminiscing of the past.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:51.660
I didn't write a book.

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:52.749
I probably should have.

00:20:52.749 --> 00:20:53.790
All those kind of things.

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:55.140
I didn't write a memoir.

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:57.000
No, I just want to make
the next thing, that

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.490
is the craziest, weirdest shit
that you could ever imagine.

00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:06.312
I don't yet know what it is,
but that's the next thing.

00:21:06.312 --> 00:21:08.722
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:14.960
BRIA SULLIVAN: So
piggybacking off of that,

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.376
I'm going to ask
one last question

00:21:16.376 --> 00:21:17.780
and we'll go to the audience.

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:20.840
But if we don't have time
to have everyone answer,

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:23.360
if just maybe, two
people want to interject.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:27.500
What is a tech-related path
that you have not gone down yet,

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:30.650
but are interested in exploring?

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:33.650
We kind of want to know,
what do you guys want to--

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:37.640
what's a cool thing to go
into next, that any of you

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:38.600
might be excited about.

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:40.760
Because I know he's been
talking about, what is it?

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.410
Tell me.

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:43.660
Or he's trying to discover it.

00:21:46.835 --> 00:21:47.960
NINA WALIA: Public service.

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:53.172
My generation, we
need to step up.

00:21:53.172 --> 00:21:55.130
It doesn't have to be
all the same people we've

00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:58.460
been seeing as
members of Congress,

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:00.590
as the people representing
you in your city.

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:05.950
So something not
tech-related I want to do.

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:06.950
BRIA SULLIVAN: One more?

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:14.530
JANNE KYTTANEN:
I'm still thinking.

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:15.320
Somebody else.

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:16.040
BRIA SULLIVAN: Anyone else?

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.540
And then we'll go
into the audience.

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:20.840
ISHMAEL MAYHEW: I think, just to
piggyback off of what she just

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:22.280
said, also, social issues.

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:25.610
I'd love to see some
technological innovations

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:27.290
in mobilizing communities.

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:31.020
And really, not just mobilizing
communities politically,

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:36.020
but also, inspiring people of
several different backgrounds

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:40.250
and multicultural
backgrounds and origins,

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:43.400
to really be active and
powerful in their communities.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:46.700
And use that technology to
grow that and make the world

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:47.820
a better place.

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:49.880
BRIA SULLIVAN: Awesome.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.590
Let's give our panel
a round of applause.

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:53.510
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:57.130 --> 00:22:59.350
How many questions
do we have time for?

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:01.060
We have time for one question.

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:02.995
Who's going to ask our
panel, one question?

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:11.145
SPEAKER: How did you
find your passion?

00:23:11.145 --> 00:23:12.520
BRIA SULLIVAN:
How did you find--

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.110
I think everyone
should answer that.

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:19.780
ISHMAEL MAYHEW: My
passion found me.

00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:23.080
I think there comes
a point in life--

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:27.130
if we're all being realistic--
where you hit rock bottom.

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:30.040
Like Darren said earlier,
what you put on Instagram

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:32.369
is your best moment, But
there's a lot of other moments

00:23:32.369 --> 00:23:33.910
that are very
discouraging, where you

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:35.810
want to give up on yourself.

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:40.480
And so, the magic happens
when you apply grit,

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.820
and you can't have
magic without grit.

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:46.540
So don't get discouraged by the
grit and the mundane moments

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:48.547
and the unglamorous moments.

00:23:48.547 --> 00:23:51.130
Where your throat is sore, and
you don't want to keep working,

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:53.200
and you're tired.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:56.362
Use those moments to
motivate you to make magic.

00:23:56.362 --> 00:23:58.742
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:05.250
NINA VIR: One thing
I would say is

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:09.390
to not be so quick to define
your passion because it's often

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:12.480
not something like
fashion or tech.

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:17.070
It might be a feeling, like
accomplishing goals or solving

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:19.090
problems-- things like that.

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:21.510
And so don't look to
put a box around it

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:23.490
and just really
look out for things

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:25.200
that you intrinsically enjoy it.

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:28.320
And things you're
also very good at.

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:30.690
DALIA MACPHEE: That's good.

00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:33.870
I always say that, if you
can't stop thinking about it

00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:35.850
and your desire to
do it is greater

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:39.332
than your fear of failure, then
you know you've hit something.

00:24:39.332 --> 00:24:41.040
And that's changed
for me over the years,

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:42.840
but technically
speaking, it's always

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:45.234
been about creating something.

00:24:45.234 --> 00:24:47.504
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:48.254 --> 00:24:49.670
NINA WALIA: I think
for me, it was

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:53.810
like someone mentioned
before, a little bit of what

00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:54.950
I don't like to do.

00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:58.220
So I started college as
a computer science major

00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:00.590
and I was sitting there
coding, and one day I

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:02.940
was like, I don't want to
do this for all my life.

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:05.980
I want to be a music journalist.

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:10.940
That's after two years of coding
so I went to journalism school.

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:14.544
But I already knew how to code.

00:25:14.544 --> 00:25:16.460
I already knew how to
make things interactive.

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:19.430
So then I was
running around, let's

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:21.200
make this multimedia video.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.630
And I'd go bother the
drama kid and let's

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:25.310
make an interactive
play for theater.

00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:28.070
And it's all because I already
knew how to code stuff.

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:30.430
But it was just
finding that, oh,

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:32.180
I can do more than
just stare at a screen.

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:33.721
I could make this
code do cool stuff,

00:25:33.721 --> 00:25:35.750
and I think that's
where it came from.

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:38.075
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:40.749 --> 00:25:42.540
JANNE KYTTANEN: Also
kind of to your point,

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:43.770
I didn't have to work for it.

00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:44.790
It found me.

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:47.030
But also, it pretty much
finds me every-- well not

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:48.900
any more, every
single night-- but I

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:51.330
would wake up in the middle
of the night with an idea.

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:54.120
So you have a higher
power controlling you.

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:59.470
So it makes you kind of let
go and just enjoy the ride.

00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:01.830
There's nothing that we
have to fight for, in a way.

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:04.650
But I can also imagine,
that a lot of people, it

00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:06.730
might not come naturally.

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:09.960
So I have one word for
that, which is curiosity.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:14.280
Stay curious, and try
to find the weirdest--

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:15.660
meet the weird people.

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:18.240
Go to the park and
look at the grass.

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.790
And go to the library
and read the weird book.

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:24.900
You might find inspiration in
areas where you might never

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:27.000
imagine it to happen to you.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.790
And ask questions, and
meet a lot of people,

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:32.700
and also, meet a
lot of older people.

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:35.496
Ask them about their
experiences through life.

00:26:35.496 --> 00:26:37.926
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:40.312 --> 00:26:42.020
BRIA SULLIVAN: I want
to thank all of you

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:43.340
for coming out today.

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:48.410
I know coming to any part of LA
is really difficult, especially

00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:49.760
over here.

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:53.270
And I'm sorry that it's so cold.

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:55.520
But thank you all
for being here.

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:58.610
Are you going to be
around to talk afterward?

00:26:58.610 --> 00:26:59.540
Yeah?

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:00.866
Awesome.

00:27:00.866 --> 00:27:03.240
Can we have one more round of
applause for our panelists,

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:03.740
please?

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:06.290
[APPLAUSE]
