00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.340
In 1927, a tall man
from New Zealand,

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.810
called Ernest
Rutherford, stood not far

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.480
from this location
at the Royal Society.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.070
And as the new president
of that institution,

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.640
he had this to say--
that he desires

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.640
a copious supply of
atoms and electrons

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.470
which have an individual
energy far transcending that

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.086
of alpha and beta particles.

00:00:35.086 --> 00:00:36.460
Now the reason he
was saying this

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.480
is because awhile
before, in his lab,

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.070
they'd been doing the so-called
famous gold foil experiments,

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.830
where they had taken
alpha particles

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.660
from radioactive decay
and impinged them

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.444
on a piece of gold foil.

00:00:49.444 --> 00:00:51.110
Now those of you who
know the story know

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.947
that what they were expecting
was that these alpha particles

00:00:53.947 --> 00:00:56.030
would kind of go straight
through and some of them

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.810
would be deflected a little bit.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.690
And what they actually
found was that just a few

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.740
of these alpha particles
pinned straight

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.239
back at them in the direction
they were firing them.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.870
And that was a real surprise.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.060
And now we know that
they had discovered

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.550
the nucleus of the atom-- the
tiny nucleus at the center.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.220
But Rutherford
understood that in order

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.120
to learn more, in order to
dig deeper into the atom,

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.920
in order to understand our
universe at a deeper level,

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.060
he was going to have
to find something

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.910
with a bit more energy--
some projectiles which

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.310
went a little bit faster.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.110
And so, effectively,
what he was asking

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.280
for at that time was the
particle accelerator.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.530
And boy, did he get some.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.260
So 90 years on, this is what
we think of now when we talk

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.391
about a particle accelerator.

00:01:49.391 --> 00:01:51.140
This is the Large
Hadron Collider, in case

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.306
you're not familiar with it.

00:01:52.306 --> 00:01:55.450
It is a 27 kilometer long
ring underneath the border

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.630
between Switzerland and France.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.360
And now we think
of these machines

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.170
as a sort of huge
behemoths, really.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.730
They are incredible feats of
engineering, design, science,

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.090
and even culture--
breaking down boundaries

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.060
between different countries.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.527
But the question is,
are these things useful?

00:02:15.527 --> 00:02:17.860
I mean, when you think about
what we're looking at there

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.460
and what Rutherford was
looking at with the atom--

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.710
atoms are tiny.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.210
And there are loads, and loads,
and load of them in anything

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.710
useful.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.260
So in the universe,
for example, if I

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.730
was to add up all the
stars in the universe,

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.260
there would be 10 to the
29 in scientific notation.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.360
So that's 1 with
29 zeros after it.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.640
That's the same
number as the number

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.710
of atoms just in the people
sitting in this room-- not even

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.470
in the chairs and the ground.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.140
So there are as many atoms
in us-- in this room--

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.910
as there are stars in
the entire universe.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.080
Remember that the universe
is 13.8 billion years old

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.940
and pretty massive.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.150
So atoms, being
very, very tiny, it

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.260
doesn't immediately
make sense that they're

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.460
going to be that useful.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.280
And especially the
particles inside them--

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.320
the subatomic particles--
it's not entirely obvious

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.340
that they're going
to be useful either.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.380
And actually, if we go
back further in history,

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.080
we find that the
initial people who

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.840
worked with other
types of particles

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.060
were also skeptical
about their use.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.530
One of the famous Friday
evening discourses

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.210
here was given by J.J.
Thomson, the physicist,

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:34.510
where he demonstrated
the particle which later

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.030
became known as the electron.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.560
And he actually came back.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.750
And this isn't that well-known--
but the Royal Institution

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.400
kindly dug through
their archives for me

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.509
and they gave me this
document beautifully titled--

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:48.550
allthediscoursesever.xls.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.900
And there was a whole host
of lovely information.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.420
And one of them that they
found for me was this,

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.589
from J.J. Thompson.

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:02.380
And he says-- and I'll
have to read up here

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.850
because my screen
is tiny-- "if there

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.110
are any among my audience, any
who, 20 years ago, listened

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.310
to the announcement I made here
of the existence of electrons,

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.640
they will, I think, admit that
they would have been skeptical

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.060
if they'd been told they
would, in another 20 years,

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.990
be listening to
another discourse

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:23.300
on the commercial application
of these electrons.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.867
For electrons are so small that
it takes about 1,700 of them

00:04:25.867 --> 00:04:28.450
to give a mass [INAUDIBLE] out
of an atom of hydrogen and they

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.180
move at such a rate"--
blah, blah, blah.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.360
"So such properties appear
rather transcendental and not

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.480
promising from a
practical point of view."

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.350
How wrong he was.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.880
And in fact, there was a toast
that famously went around

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.750
the Cavendish Lab-- it's J.J.
Thomson's favorite quote--

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:48.680
"to the electron...

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.100
May it never be of
any use to anybody."

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.380
So I thought, with
particle accelerators,

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.047
what I'd start with is to
show you how we can actually

00:04:57.047 --> 00:04:57.880
make some particles.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.900
So I have here a very
small particle accelerator

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.300
rather like the one that
J.J. Thomson would have used.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.120
And to power it, over here, I
have a high voltage oscillator,

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.695
which is actually an induction
coil, which Faraday-- himself

00:05:10.695 --> 00:05:12.820
presenting in here-- would
have been very proud of.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.450
So I'm going to switch
this on and it actually

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:23.830
converts a DC from a battery
here to a very high voltage AC.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.680
And then over this
side-- fingers

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.110
crossed my camera is working.

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:36.747
If we dim the lights
a little-- perhaps

00:05:36.747 --> 00:05:37.788
I can move that on there.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.770
There we are.

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:42.442
OK.

00:05:42.442 --> 00:05:44.650
So that's is actually
generating a beam of electrons.

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.485
So to generate
electrons is quite easy.

00:05:46.485 --> 00:05:48.780
You, more or less, apply
voltage to a piece of metal

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.307
and they start jumping out.

00:05:50.307 --> 00:05:52.140
So this is what's called
a cathode ray tube.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.977
And some of you will
be familiar with those

00:05:53.977 --> 00:05:55.810
because they were in
the back of televisions

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.640
for many, many years, before
we had flat panel ones.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.950
So this has some of the basic
components of a particle

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:02.880
accelerator.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.640
So it starts with
some particles.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.370
And then the next thing we have
to do is give it some energy.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.370
And in this, all I'm doing
is applying a high voltage

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.080
across the terminals to rip
the electrons out of one side

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.140
and attract them
to the other side.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.550
Now the other thing I can do
with this beam of particles

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.150
is I can actually
move it around.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.270
And that's an incredibly
important part

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.990
of a particle
accelerator-- being

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.284
able to control the
beam of electrons.

00:06:26.284 --> 00:06:27.950
And to do that, we
actually use magnets.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.540
So I have, literally, just
a simple bar magnet here.

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:36.800
And I can show you that the
beam bends when I bring it near.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.690
So this is just a
simple magnetic field.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.070
I hope you can
see that up there.

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.924
I'll do that again.

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:48.790
And this is a basic property
of charged particles

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:49.670
in a magnetic field.

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:51.470
They will bend around a corner.

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:54.460
So if I hold the magnet the
opposite direction, then,

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.661
as predicted, we should
get the opposite effect.

00:06:56.661 --> 00:06:58.410
So we'll turn it around
a few times there.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.060
So that has a few of the
basic components of a particle

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.250
accelerator.

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:08.420
And I'll just come
back over here.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.410
But I think you might
not be surprised to hear

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:13.924
that they get a little bit
more complicated than that.

00:07:13.924 --> 00:07:15.590
And we'll get onto
that in a little bit.

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.710
I'm just going to
switch that off.

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:20.280
A lot of people
think, when you start

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.550
talking about
particle accelerators,

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:24.530
that we should start
from the very start--

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:26.230
from generating
particles-- and then

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:29.040
build up how we get to
the very high energies

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.650
at the speed of light.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:32.440
But actually, when we
design accelerators,

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.430
we start from the other end.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.680
We sort of start
with, what would you

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.930
like a beam of particles
to actually do?

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.480
So it might be, for
example, that you would like

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.060
to sterilize medical products.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.450
And in that case,
what you'd need

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:49.610
is actually a 10
megaelectron-volt beam

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:53.110
of electrons, so quite a bit
higher in energy than this one.

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.480
And in that case, a high
intensity beam of electrons

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.860
is sent through all of
the medical products that

00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:59.050
go into your hospital.

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:02.510
So syringes, bandages, and that
kind of thing are sent through

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:04.860
on a conveyor belt,
irradiated with electrons,

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:08.550
and that's actually able
to kill any of the germs--

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:11.470
every single germ or bit of
bacteria that might be on those

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:14.390
products when they;re generated.

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:18.280
So that translates from a
use back into the design

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.430
of the accelerator.

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:22.740
And that's a commercial system
that's sold on the market

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:23.300
to do that.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:28.260
Or maybe instead, I
want a beam of something

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.460
to, say, scan some cargo.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:35.080
In that case, you could start
with a fairly similar system

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.880
with electrons, use those
electrons into a heavy metal

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.669
target to generate x-rays,
and send the x-rays

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:45.320
through your cargo, and by
doing so, map out the density

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:49.930
and if there's any contraband
or whatever that's inside cargo.

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:51.070
And these are used as well.

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:53.360
And there's another
option, actually,

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.290
at the moment of
potentially using neutrons

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:58.040
to do the same kind of scanning.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.340
So that's another thing.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:02.187
Perhaps you might
want to treat cancer.

00:09:02.187 --> 00:09:03.770
Are you getting the
impression there's

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:06.620
a couple of uses here of
particle accelerators?

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:07.840
I hope so.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.490
You might want to treat cancer.

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:12.590
And actually, radiotherapy--
LINACs, as we call them,

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:14.530
linear accelerators--
are some of the most

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:16.490
ubiquitous accelerators around.

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:19.140
There's five or six of them
in most major hospitals.

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:21.860
And this is actually just a
small electronic accelerator.

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:24.580
Again, it smashes electrons
into a metal target,

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:26.630
generates x-rays,
and that's what's

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:29.040
used to treat
cancer in something

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:32.800
like 40% of successful
treatment cases.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.680
So that's a huge application.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.970
Now I think it's fair to
say J.J. Thomson did not

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:40.160
predict that.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.372
We've come quite a long way.

00:09:42.372 --> 00:09:45.260
And that's sort of electrons,
but we can also move

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.490
on to other types of particles.

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:52.100
We know how to generate
beams of protons

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:55.010
and use those to
generate other things as

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:57.590
well, with our
understanding of isotopes.

00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:59.780
So one other area
in medicine where

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:05.400
we use protons in particular
is to generate radioisotopes.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.090
And one example of
where they might be used

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:11.355
is in PET scans-- positron
emission tomography scans.

00:10:11.355 --> 00:10:12.980
And they're great
because they actually

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:16.320
also use our understanding
of anti-matter.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.380
So in a positron
emission tomography scan,

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:22.210
if you don't know, someone is
fed a small amount of what's

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:23.710
called fluorodeoxyglucose.

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:25.210
It's a sweet liquid.

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:29.170
And into that is a tiny bit
of radioactive fluorine-18,

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:32.270
which is being generated
by a particle accelerator,

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:34.970
using a beam onto a
target to generate

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:37.060
that radioactive isotope.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:39.740
When it's inside the
body, it emits positrons.

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:41.240
It's a beta emitter.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.390
Now positrons,
being anti-matter,

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:45.740
when they come in contact
with normal matter--

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.350
electrons-- they annihilate.

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:51.270
So they literally
disappear and, instead,

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:54.090
generate two photons--
two particles of light--

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:56.280
in exactly opposite directions.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.270
So we're able to then
catch those photons,

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:02.170
going in opposite directions,
every time they happen

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:04.760
and build up a picture of what's
happening inside the person's

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:05.800
body.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.160
And because this
fluorodeoxyglucose actually

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.860
concentrates in high
metabolic areas,

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:13.450
that means you're more
likely to map out areas

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:16.650
where there might be cancer,
heart disease, et cetera.

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:20.344
So that's another potential use.

00:11:20.344 --> 00:11:22.010
So if you add them
all up, far from just

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:24.170
being particle physics
machines, there

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:25.970
are loads and loads
of those things.

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:30.290
So there's over 35,000 particle
accelerators in the world.

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:32.760
And I've just sort of
given a bit of a pie chart

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.270
of how they're broken down.

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:38.520
So something like 45% of them
are used for radiotherapy

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:41.580
and then most of
the rest of them

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:44.510
are used for industrial
use-- so whether that's

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:49.110
treating things, scanning
things, treating radial tires,

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:51.200
changing the properties
of gemstones,

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.420
treating dirty drinking
water to clean it up.

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:57.440
All kinds of different things.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:01.270
So you might get the idea
that, actually, these things

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:03.380
are pretty useful machines.

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:07.010
And for me, working on
them, I'd really quite

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:09.085
like to see what else
we could do with them.

00:12:09.085 --> 00:12:10.460
But before we go
into that, we're

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:12.550
going to have to understand
a little bit more

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:14.990
about how they work.

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:17.470
So in the cathode
ray tube before,

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:22.377
I had just a single voltage
supply-- just a single voltage

00:12:22.377 --> 00:12:24.710
that the particles are moving
through and gaining energy

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:26.850
as they did so.

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:29.170
But that's quite limiting
because you can only

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:32.620
gain as much energy as
that voltage gives you.

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:35.930
But the other way you can do
it is you can take a voltage

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:37.904
and try and re-use
it again and again.

00:12:37.904 --> 00:12:39.820
And that's what this
little demonstration here

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:41.910
is supposed to show
you, in one second.

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:54.770
So this is powered by a Van
de Graaff generator, which,

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:57.330
I should say, Van de
Graaff accelerators

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:00.510
were one of the original types
of particle accelerators.

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:03.590
They use a rubber belt to build
up static electricity, which

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:05.290
goes on the top of the dome.

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:08.290
And then I've attached
that high voltage, which

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:13.300
is about 30,000 volts on this
device, onto my plastic bowl

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:17.380
here, onto four strips which
are crossed in the center.

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.770
So those four strips in
the center get charged up

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:21.990
and the other ones
around the outside-- I've

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:23.800
kept those at ground.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:27.100
So what happens here-- and
it's a very, very simple model

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.550
of an accelerator--
is I have a ping pong

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:32.620
ball covered in
conducting paint.

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.700
So it picks up the charge
on the charge strip

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:36.550
and gets pushed away.

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:39.140
And then it rolls around
a bit, dumps the charge

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.480
on the grounded strip,
but keeps rolling.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.270
So every time it goes
over a charged strip,

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:46.070
it gets a little bit of a kick.

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:48.630
And so you saw, when I turned
it on, it started in the middle

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:52.220
and slowly, it built up some
speed, built up momentum,

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:55.590
and now it's limited by friction
as to how fast it could go.

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:57.950
Otherwise, I'm sure it could
reach the speed of light.

00:13:57.950 --> 00:13:58.740
I'm sure.

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:00.730
I'm sure it could.

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:04.720
So this is a very basic model
of a particle accelerator,

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.800
but there's a little
bit of a problem

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.735
with how that one in
particular operates.

00:14:08.735 --> 00:14:10.110
I'm just going to
switch him off.

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:17.740
So one of the flaws in that
demonstration actually--

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:20.390
and it is lovely,
but it's flawed--

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:22.970
is that I've just got
a single voltage there,

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:24.750
which I'm really
using again and again.

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:27.270
But in order to do
that, I actually

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:31.090
have to change the
charge on the particle.

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:34.440
And real particles don't
change charge, sadly.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.465
So we have to come
up with another way.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:42.000
And in the real
world, we actually

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.540
use radio frequency
cavities, which

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:44.630
I'll show you in a moment.

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:47.820
But this was the idea
that Ernest Lawrence

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.280
had when he invented a type
of particle accelerator

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:51.700
called the cyclotron.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:56.430
So what he was doing was taking
a single, oscillating voltage

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:57.920
and using it again and again.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.140
And the particle
would gain energy.

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:02.940
And because it was in a
simple magnetic field,

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:05.609
it would spiral
outwards as it did.

00:15:05.609 --> 00:15:07.150
So as you gain
energy, the particle's

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:09.052
going to spiral outwards.

00:15:09.052 --> 00:15:10.510
And so these machines
were limited,

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:14.390
in terms of energy--
physically, by their size.

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:18.360
So this is a 1
electron volt, I think,

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:21.985
proton machine that he built
with his graduate student,

00:15:21.985 --> 00:15:23.550
Milton Stanley
Livingston, who did

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:25.510
a lot of the practical work.

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:28.640
And cyclotrons really became the
cornerstone of nuclear physics

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.150
research for a long time.

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:32.527
And they're still
used today, especially

00:15:32.527 --> 00:15:34.110
in things like
radioisotope production

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:37.190
and actually new forms of
cancer treatment as well.

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:39.030
So that's the cyclotron.

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:41.060
The other type of
accelerator I'd

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:43.130
like to introduce you
to-- because there's

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:45.990
two circular types which
are related to my work.

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:47.060
That's one of them.

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:49.470
The other type is
the synchrotron.

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:51.340
And this now is
the type of machine

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:54.460
that we use to reach
higher and higher energies.

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:57.459
The cyclotron was limited
by the size of the magnet

00:15:57.459 --> 00:15:58.250
that you could use.

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:01.130
So instead, we had to come
up with another idea of how

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:05.300
we can reach higher
energies but without having

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:08.600
to have these huge, huge magnets
that were just incredibly

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:09.820
heavy.

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:12.820
And then a guy called Marcus
Oliphant-- an Australia,

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:16.654
actually-- invented the
machine called the synchrotron.

00:16:16.654 --> 00:16:18.070
Now this machine's
a bit different

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:20.520
because it looks quite
different from the cyclotron.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.830
It just has a single
large ring of a series

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:26.390
of different magnets
around the ring.

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:28.540
So what we have to do
is we have to ramp up

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:31.280
the strength of
those magnets in time

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.800
with the acceleration
of the particles

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.860
in order to actually keep
everything synchronized.

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:38.640
And that's where it
gets its name from me.

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.270
That's where the synchrotron
actually comes from.

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:42.990
And there are three
main components

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:44.880
of that-- there's
dipole magnets, which

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.350
do the bending, quadrupole
magnets, which we'll

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:50.510
come onto in a minute, and
then there's these RF cavities

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:53.380
that I alluded to before.

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:56.030
So I've just got a
little video here.

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:56.990
Here we go.

00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:59.410
So this is what a
radio frequency cavity

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:01.640
looks like on the
Large Hadron Collider.

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:04.250
And that thing's
probably about this tall.

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:06.240
This thing operates
at 400 megahertz,

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:09.599
so the oscillations in that
are 400 times per second.

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:14.359
And it's fed by a high voltage
radio frequency signal.

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:16.800
So inside that cavity,
effectively, there's

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.800
an electromagnetic wave
goes up, and down, and up,

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:23.460
and down 400 million
times a second.

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.530
And as the particles
go through that,

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:28.119
they have to be timed
exactly in order

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:31.140
that when the field is up
and in accelerating mode,

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:32.500
it gets a kick forward.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.150
And when the field
is down, they're

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:38.684
not seeing the field because we
can't always have the field up.

00:17:38.684 --> 00:17:39.850
So that's quite a large one.

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:42.480
That's 400 megahertz, so
they're quite big cavities.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:46.670
I actually have here the
world's smallest radio frequency

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:49.300
cavity, which I'm
lucky to have one.

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.320
This was developed
for a new project

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:54.700
at CERN called the
Compact Linear Collider.

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:56.770
So that was 400
megahertz, that one.

00:17:56.770 --> 00:18:01.300
This one is 30 gigahertz--
so very, very high frequency.

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:05.000
So the particles would
travel through the center

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.250
of this device.

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:08.220
And the RF is fed
in through some wave

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:12.720
guides, which are on the top,
and these ones are really tiny.

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.230
And inside there is where
the particles actually gain

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:17.300
some energy as they go through.

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:20.620
But it's not very easy to see
exactly what happens inside

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:23.600
of there, so I've got a really
simple demonstration to show

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.540
you, which is how a
sort of radio frequency

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:30.050
electromagnetic feel can give
some energy to some particles.

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:32.700
So if we can dim the
lights a little bit?

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:36.460
I have a plasma ball
here, in the center.

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:39.100
I know it's pretty, but
ignore the plasma bit.

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:44.340
It's generated using a 30
kilohertz oscillation, which

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:48.232
is emanating electromagnetic
waves outwards, which

00:18:48.232 --> 00:18:49.440
is what's forming the plasma.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:53.630
But also, those waves
continue outside the confines

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:55.390
of the plasma ball,
which means that if I

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:58.820
put some particles in the
way, those particles actually

00:18:58.820 --> 00:18:59.510
get accelerated.

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:05.060
And you'll notice
that, actually, I'm

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:07.330
not touching that.

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:09.290
And actually, I can
ground it as well.

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:12.880
So I can sort of
turn it on and off--

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.946
sort of creating a
little bit of a circuit.

00:19:14.946 --> 00:19:16.820
So it does work if I
touch it, but, actually,

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:18.610
one of the main things
I want to show you

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:20.840
is the sort of RF
waves coming out here,

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:22.380
accelerating the particles.

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:26.170
And that's why it actually
switches on and off, just

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:27.120
in proximity.

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:28.510
A new party trick for you.

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:34.060
So yes.

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:38.350
So that's how we give
particles energy now.

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:40.740
But we need to go a little
bit further than that.

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:43.722
And we need to understand how
particles are focused as well.

00:19:43.722 --> 00:19:45.930
So it would be easy to assume
that all you have to do

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:48.540
is get the particles, give
them energy, bend them

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:50.580
round in a corner, job done.

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:51.404
No.

00:19:51.404 --> 00:19:53.320
We actually have to keep
them focused as well.

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:56.050
And we have a problem with that
because the types of magnets

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:59.190
we use-- and any
type of magnet--

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:03.010
can't focus a beam of particles
in both dimensions at once.

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:08.620
So if I squeeze it horizontally,
it's pulled apart vertically.

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:12.650
And I'll solve this dilemma
for you in a little while,

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:14.280
but first, I just
want to show you--

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.540
this is a real, physical
quadrupole magnet over here.

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:20.420
It weighs about 30 kilos, so
I wouldn't try picking it up.

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:25.860
But this one is for a fairly
medium energy electron beam.

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:29.280
But once we get up to the
very, very high energy-- say,

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:31.880
proton beams-- we need
much, much stronger magnets.

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.350
And that's why you get these
huge ones at the Large Hadron

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:35.680
Collider.

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:38.870
So all of that then
in the synchrotron

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:41.740
has to be synchronized together.

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:43.940
So we have to have the
accelerating cavities,

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:45.600
we have to have the
bending magnets,

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.870
and we have to have
the focusing system all

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:50.170
acting on the beam
in perfect timing

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:51.980
in order to accelerate the beam.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:54.360
And on most synchrotrons,
we use something

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:56.860
like a sinusoidal cycle
of the magnetic field

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:58.340
and we link everything to that.

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:01.800
So this is just showing you
what that cycle would look like.

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:04.550
We would inject the beam at
the low point of the cycle.

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:05.960
As the particles
are accelerated,

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.100
the field increases.

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:10.420
And then we would extract
the beam at the top.

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:13.100
Now that's a limitation
for the synchrotron

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:16.070
because it means-- great as they
are and they can reach whatever

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:18.760
energy you want, as long as you
have strong enough magnets--

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:20.270
they have a cycle limitation.

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:24.650
They only cycle-- most of
them-- often once or a few times

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:25.390
a second.

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:28.780
The rapid cycling versions are
up to sort of 50 to 70 times

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:29.430
per second.

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:31.780
So that's a limitation
that will become important

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:34.530
in a little while.

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:38.230
Now backtracking a little
while-- at the start,

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:41.360
I was showing you
lots of applications.

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:44.320
We face many, many
challenges today,

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.580
especially in the 21st century.

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:48.360
And as a scientist,
like me, you don't

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.100
have to go very far
to pick a challenge,

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:52.580
you just have to sort of
watch the headline news.

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:54.420
This morning I wrote
down-- what was there?

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:57.650
There was climate change,
overpopulation, food and water

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:02.190
shortages, incurable diseases,
aging populations, security

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:04.040
and terror threats,
or our planet

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:07.700
being destroyed by an asteroid--
not an astronaut, sorry.

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:10.050
An asteroid.

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:12.520
Don't get too depressed though.

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:15.580
Yet I've chosen
to work on these.

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:19.220
I've chosen to work on
particle accelerators

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:22.480
when all those glorious
challenges are out there.

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:25.890
And the reason is
because I believe

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:28.730
and I want to use
what we've learned

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:30.940
from this field
and these machines

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:35.880
to help solve some of these
real challenges facing us today.

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:40.190
Now the next generation of
accelerators for particle

00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:42.610
physics could take any form.

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:45.380
So we're researching lots
of different options--

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:47.450
whether that's a very
long, straight line

00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:49.260
linear accelerator,
whether that's

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:53.330
a circular accelerator,
or even a more exotic one,

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:55.410
colliding different
types of particles--

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:58.160
say particles called muons,
which are like the heavier

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.890
version of the electron.

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:03.270
And they're brilliant
and that's really

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:04.930
pushing our technology forward.

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:09.070
But there are other areas
of accelerated science

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:13.250
which are pushing us in a
slightly different direction.

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:15.410
So in the accelerator
world, we talk about there

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:16.680
being two frontiers.

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:19.632
There's the energy frontier--
and, in particle physics,

00:23:19.632 --> 00:23:21.090
that's where we're
going with that.

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:23.160
We're trying to get to
higher and higher energies

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:26.310
in order to reach heavier
and heavier mass and more

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:28.450
rare and exotic particles.

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:31.250
But there's also something
called the intensity frontier.

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:33.830
And that's the one
that I work on.

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:36.280
And the intensity
frontier tends to lead us

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:38.200
towards different applications.

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.910
It could also lead us towards
a new particle physics

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:42.230
applications.

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:44.250
But one of the main
ones is actually

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:48.390
to generate neutrons using a
high intensity beam of protons

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:51.230
and then use those neutrons
to do other things.

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:53.760
In the UK especially, people
are really good at that

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:56.400
because we have a spallation
neutron source called

00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:00.155
ISIS, which is at the Rutherford
Appleton Lab in Oxfordshire.

00:24:00.155 --> 00:24:02.030
And that's been going
for more than 30 years.

00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:03.790
And it's generating
wonderful science

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:06.250
from all kinds of
fields using neutrons

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:09.630
to investigate matter, and
materials, and biology,

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:12.220
and aircraft wings,
and oil part blockages,

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:15.960
and how to save babies with
[INAUDIBLE], and all kinds

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.570
of amazing science.

00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:20.570
So on the one hand,
we need to understand,

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:22.780
to generate more
science that way,

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:25.320
how we can generate more
neutrons using a particle

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.220
accelerator.

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:28.910
But there's actually
other challenges

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:31.170
which are pushing our
field further, and further,

00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:33.050
and further.

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:35.880
And one of those
is how we might be

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:41.760
able to deal with the nuclear
waste problem or parts

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.570
of the nuclear waste problem.

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:46.280
And there's an idea out
there called accelerator

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:48.920
driven subcritical reactors.

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.760
Some of you may have
heard of this already.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:55.700
Now this idea is to take a very
high intensity proton beam,

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:59.410
smash it into a target,
generate neutrons

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:03.750
in the same way we do in the
ISIS accelerator, and then,

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:07.810
using those neutrons to drive
existing nuclear waste--

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:10.340
especially minor actinides,
high level nuclear waste--

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:14.770
through their cycle
in order to reduce

00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:19.080
the lifetime of that they
would have to be stored for.

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:22.520
So one particularly popular
idea is to mix in an element

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:23.700
called thorium.

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:26.420
And thorium is actually
a fertile element, not

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:29.990
a fissile one-- unlike
parts of uranium.

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:34.460
But thorium is about
twice as abundant

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:38.440
in the earth as uranium is and
you don't have to refine it.

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:40.150
So if you mix in
thorium and then

00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:43.980
you mix in these existing types
of nuclear waste from existing

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:47.020
reactive fleets, you would
be able to bombard it

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:49.090
with neutrons from
the accelerator,

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:51.420
transmute the nuclear
waste, and get rid of it.

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:54.520
If you did it in the right way
and within enough power coming

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:58.860
in, you could generate energy
from that process as well.

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:01.990
But this is an incredibly,
incredibly challenging

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:03.080
application.

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:06.310
So let me give you kind of
where we're at versus where

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:07.290
we'd like to be.

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:09.990
This is a plot,
which is often used

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:12.766
in my part of the accelerator
field, which shows the beam

00:26:12.766 --> 00:26:14.890
power of different
accelerators, which I'll explain

00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:16.170
a little bit at the moment.

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:18.930
But all you need to
know is the energies

00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:22.630
are on the x-axis and the beam
current-- so how many particles

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:26.380
per second-- are on the y-axis.

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:29.134
And we can see sort of different
generations of machines there.

00:26:29.134 --> 00:26:31.300
So you can see, for example,
some of the high energy

00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:35.340
particle physics machines are
very high on the energy axis,

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:38.500
not so high up the
beam current axis.

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:40.040
And so when we
multiply those two

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:46.350
numbers to give a beam power,
it's maybe not that high.

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:50.280
It's maybe 0.1 megawatts.

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:53.330
On the other hand, the optimum
energy for generating neutrons

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:56.110
is about 1 gigaelectron vote.

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:59.160
And so you'll see on
sort of the left hand,

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:02.180
but up at the top, a bunch
of facilities and machines

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:05.410
which are more attuned to
this intensity frontier, which

00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:08.330
has slightly low energy,
but they're generating

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:10.630
quite enormous beam currents.

00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:12.770
And actually, state of
the art, at the moment,

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:15.470
is to get to about
1 megawatt or just

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:19.570
over 1 megawatt, which has
being done at the SNS Spallation

00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:24.070
Source in the US and at PSI,
which is in Switzerland, that's

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:25.520
done that before.

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:29.510
Now where we need to be for
these future applications is

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:33.170
at least 10
megawatts, if not 100.

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:37.620
So we need to be 10 to
100 times more powerful

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:39.350
than we are at the moment.

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:43.730
Now I haven't mentioned
reliability yet.

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:46.000
When you get higher in
power, it's much harder

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.550
to make your machine
reliable, so you

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:50.910
can leave it on all the
time, run it all the time.

00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:52.820
But actually, a
real application,

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:55.210
like transmuting nuclear
waste, would also

00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:58.670
require us to be
switched on all the time.

00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:01.600
So we actually have to
be up to 1,000 times more

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:04.400
reliable-- so less small
trips and small problems

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:05.530
than we have at the moment.

00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:08.730
And we've never designed an
accelerator with that in mind.

00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:14.350
So just to backtrack a second--
how might we actually do that?

00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:16.220
Which parameters do
we have to play with?

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:19.290
Well, to get to high power,
which is what we need,

00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:22.390
we have sort of three pieces
of the puzzle-- there's

00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:24.590
the energy-- but,
as I said, that's

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:27.770
kind of fixed because if
we're generating neutrons,

00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:30.620
1 GeV is about
right-- then there's

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:36.230
the particles per
beam-- and that's

00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:39.627
a limitation which I'll
get to in a little while.

00:28:39.627 --> 00:28:41.210
And then there's the
repetition rate--

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:42.870
there's how many
times per second

00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:45.170
you can run the
machine-- because that

00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:48.680
limits your average
intensity over time.

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:51.060
And I said before that the
two machines I was looking at

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:53.715
are the cyclotron
and the synchrotron.

00:28:53.715 --> 00:28:56.270
The cyclotron is
limited in energy.

00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:59.840
It can't go up 1 GeV, so it
can't get to the optimum energy

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:02.190
that we need for
this application.

00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:06.240
The synchrotron is limited
in its repetition rate.

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:08.310
So in order to generate
a high average current,

00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:13.160
it has to try and operate
it many times a cycle

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:16.030
or to really, really ramp
up how many particles there

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:18.880
are in the machine at one time,
which is really problematic.

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.670
But there is actually
another option.

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:24.130
And this it's a type of machine
that I have specialized in.

00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:26.120
And this is called a
fixed field alternating

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:28.220
gradient accelerator.

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:30.690
Right now, this isn't going to
make a huge amount of sense,

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:33.270
but the main points in
that are in the title--

00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:35.320
it's a fixed field,
so that means

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:38.040
we don't ramp the
magnetic field in time,

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.980
and alternating gradient.

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:41.450
And this alternating
gradient has

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:43.408
something to do with the
focusing system, which

00:29:43.408 --> 00:29:46.120
I'll explain a little bit
more about in a second.

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.380
So it uses the same
focusing as a synchrotron

00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:51.330
so we can reach high
energies, but also the fixed

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:54.080
magnetic field of
the cyclotron, which

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:58.110
means high energies, and
also no sort of limitation,

00:29:58.110 --> 00:30:01.970
and giant magnets,
and things like that.

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:04.580
So the beam in this
machine, it does actually

00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:09.180
spiral outwards a little
bit, but only a small amount.

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:10.780
And we've arranged
the magnetic field

00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:14.330
to increase with radius
in a very particular way,

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:16.460
so that as the beam
spirals outward,

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:18.500
it sees a higher
and higher field.

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:22.210
So it sees a field
like a synchrotron,

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:25.090
but we don't have to
ramp the thing in time.

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:26.920
And in terms of
high intensity, this

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:29.640
could be a huge advantage
to us in the future.

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:32.840
And to understand a little
bit more about that,

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:35.350
I actually want to talk
about how we trap particles

00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:36.160
and how we focus.

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:38.790
I've kind of been alluding
to this magnet that squeezed

00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:41.460
one way and didn't the other.

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:44.290
So I've got, over here, a very
sort of visual demonstration

00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:46.870
to show you how this works.

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:50.150
So if I have my
particles in a beam

00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:53.190
and they're traveling
through a series of magnets,

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:55.940
when they go through,
say, a focusing magnet,

00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:59.074
they're going to say a magnetic
field which controls it

00:30:59.074 --> 00:31:00.740
like this-- so if
it's too far that way,

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:02.115
it'll push it back
to the center.

00:31:02.115 --> 00:31:04.270
And if it's too far this
way, it will push it back

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:05.590
to the center.

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:07.840
But unfortunately, when it
goes through the other type

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:10.890
of magnet, it will be defocused.

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:12.510
So no matter where
it is, it's always

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:15.830
going to be pulled away from
the center and defocused.

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:19.530
Now I think, to those of you
looking at this demonstration,

00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:23.500
there's an obvious solution
to how we solve that problem

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:26.870
and how we make that
focusing stable.

00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:29.250
And that is--
well, in this case,

00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:32.270
we have to alternate the
gradient of that focusing.

00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:34.340
That's what I mean by
alternating gradient.

00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:36.350
And in this particular
case, we can do that

00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:38.730
by actually physically
spinning this device.

00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:48.869
It creates quite a wind.

00:31:48.869 --> 00:31:49.910
Here's the difficult bit.

00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:55.344
I have to try and trap
a particle with it.

00:31:55.344 --> 00:31:56.010
Let's have a go.

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:11.580
Thank you very much.

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:14.660
And again, we'll come back to
that in a little while as well.

00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:19.810
So if we get the alternating
gradient correct,

00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:22.620
and the right speed, and
the right everything,

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:24.430
then we can trap our particles.

00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:28.700
And that's quite a fundamental
thing in accelerator physics.

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:31.930
And it leads to this principle
that we call strong focusing.

00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:36.380
And this is why the synchrotron
was such a great invention

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:38.950
and allowed us to reach
higher energies-- because

00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:45.410
by alternating the magnets
back and forth between focusing

00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:49.330
and defocusing, we were able
to focus in both planes.

00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:52.340
And not only that, but we can
focus in both planes stronger

00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:56.700
than any other way we
know of focusing particles

00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:58.910
because it's sort of
analogous, but not

00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:03.390
quite like lenses of light.

00:33:03.390 --> 00:33:05.250
But the slight
other problem though

00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:08.710
is that you can't
choose anywhere.

00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:11.560
Now this is, genuinely, a
plot from my PhD Thesis.

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:12.690
I'm actually not kidding.

00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:18.780
So what I was showing to you
before, with this Paul trap--

00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:20.525
I've set it to a
particular speed.

00:33:20.525 --> 00:33:23.190
I set it running--
this saddle shape.

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:24.460
And I put the particle on.

00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:28.690
And it was trapped for a short
while before it flew off again.

00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:31.780
But that actually only
works at certain speeds.

00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:33.930
So this diagram here
is showing you--

00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:40.290
on the x and the y-axis-- kind
of the focusing strengths, so

00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:42.990
the curvature, on one.

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:46.120
And let's say we're looking at
the speed on the other axis.

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:46.870
It doesn't matter.

00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:49.050
There's two parameters there.

00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:50.700
We're changing a couple of them.

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:53.436
And only for certain sets of
those parameters is it stable.

00:33:57.610 --> 00:33:59.340
The green and the
red show that it

00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:02.110
has to be stable in
two different ways.

00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:06.931
So if I set this running
again-- and those of you,

00:34:06.931 --> 00:34:08.389
especially if you're
higher up, you

00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:10.575
might be able to observe
this quite closely.

00:34:17.738 --> 00:34:21.060
I have to feel exactly when
it's in the right spot.

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:22.159
There we go.

00:34:22.159 --> 00:34:25.250
So if you were to observe
that closely-- whoa.

00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:27.261
I'll try again--
you would actually

00:34:27.261 --> 00:34:29.219
notice that there's a
couple of different types

00:34:29.219 --> 00:34:30.360
of oscillations.

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:34.830
There's sort of one round this
way, a sort of radial one,

00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:37.710
and then there's
also a vertical one.

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:40.010
And both of those have
to be correct in order

00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:41.899
for it to stay put.

00:34:41.899 --> 00:34:43.732
So let me just put that
back on there again.

00:34:52.024 --> 00:34:53.440
Oh, I think that's
the sweet spot.

00:34:55.989 --> 00:34:57.910
There we go.

00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:59.780
I'm not the best at doing that.

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:03.700
We have other people
who are better at it.

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:07.334
Otherwise, if it's not
rotating at the right speed

00:35:07.334 --> 00:35:09.250
or if it's not in the
sweet spot particularly,

00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:10.041
it goes flying off.

00:35:10.041 --> 00:35:18.400
So for example, if I do it
much, much slower-- a little

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:19.240
bit too slow.

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:22.010
Come on-- and if
I pop it on then,

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:24.440
I think, based on
just intuition,

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:27.910
you can probably tell that
that's not going to work.

00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:30.430
But I'll give it
a fair try anyway.

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:33.600
So more or less, it just builds
up and comes straight off.

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:39.970
And I'll do the same thing at
an incredibly dizzying speed.

00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:40.994
Full power?

00:35:40.994 --> 00:35:41.800
Yeah.

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:43.240
Yeah?

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:43.740
All right.

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:44.239
Full power.

00:35:44.239 --> 00:35:46.037
Woo.

00:35:46.037 --> 00:35:47.120
It gives off quite a wind.

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:50.090
All right.

00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:51.256
I'll pop that back on there.

00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:56.410
And again, complete rubbish.

00:35:56.410 --> 00:35:57.370
Completely unstable.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.940
And that's because, as
this diagram shows you,

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:08.300
you can only be stable
in particular dimensions.

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:10.550
And the fascinating thing
is that the mathematics that

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:14.300
describes this saddle shape and
the mathematics that describes

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:16.740
are focusing in a
particle accelerator

00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:18.687
are pretty much identical.

00:36:18.687 --> 00:36:19.770
And this thing has a name.

00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:20.770
It's called a Paul trap.

00:36:20.770 --> 00:36:23.460
And I'll come back to
that in a little while.

00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:25.210
So we have to set
up our accelerator

00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:28.840
with a focusing system
in a very specific way

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:32.890
so that it sits in one
of these stable regions.

00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:34.560
We usually use the
region which is

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:36.940
on the sort of bottom
left corner of that plot

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:39.820
because it's fairly easy
to reach with normal magnet

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:41.550
strengths and things like that.

00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:44.520
But you can see that it's
a relatively small area,

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:47.172
so we can't just put
magnets anywhere.

00:36:47.172 --> 00:36:49.380
We actually have to choose
them and design them very,

00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:51.320
very carefully.

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:54.190
But I showed you before,
with this device here,

00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:57.490
that when we do that,
we set off oscillations.

00:36:57.490 --> 00:37:02.960
Now in physics, in any system
which has an oscillation,

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:07.460
there's one problem which
we're always going to run into,

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:10.249
which is the problem
of resonances.

00:37:10.249 --> 00:37:12.540
Now when I say the word
resonance, I'm sure most of you

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:13.706
know what I'm talking about.

00:37:13.706 --> 00:37:15.400
If you have a system
that's oscillating,

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:17.490
and you occasionally
kick it, and you kick it

00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:20.350
in the same way every time,
it builds up and builds up

00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:23.350
exponentially, and you get a
resonance, and, in this case,

00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:25.800
your beam goes flying into
the wall of your particle

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:28.480
accelerator, which
isn't such a good thing.

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:32.560
So this diagram is showing
you, on the x-axis,

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:37.650
say, the oscillation rate of,
say, one of these oscillations.

00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:39.545
So maybe that's the
one around this way.

00:37:39.545 --> 00:37:41.920
And the vertical axis is
showing you the oscillation rate

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:44.030
in the other direction.

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:46.187
So they interact as well.

00:37:46.187 --> 00:37:48.520
And so one of the reasons why
I can never get this thing

00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:50.790
to stay more than
about 30 seconds

00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:53.670
is because the turntable
isn't precisely flat

00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:56.120
because there's imperfections
in the building up.

00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:58.460
Not that it's imperfect--
it's beautiful.

00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:02.100
It's beautifully made, but
it's not submicron level,

00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:04.740
just saying.

00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:08.140
So we will always have little
imperfections which build up.

00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:09.830
So when we're designing
an accelerator,

00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:12.290
we have a really
tapped choice to make,

00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:16.370
which is, what value do I
choose for those oscillations

00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:19.690
to keep my beam in the machine?

00:38:19.690 --> 00:38:21.520
And that's why I've
shown you this diagram

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:24.990
because it's pretty
tough to spot.

00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:29.120
Your guess is, literally, as
good as mine, in that case.

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:32.270
But we do-- we choose a
specific point in that diagram.

00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:33.570
We might choose a few.

00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:36.110
We have some flexibility, so
we might operate the machine

00:38:36.110 --> 00:38:38.530
in slightly different ways.

00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:40.280
And usually, we try
and place that spot

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:42.400
as far away from any
and especially the

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:46.970
crossing over points, where
different orders of resonances

00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:48.180
actually cross over.

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:50.900
And they can be driven
by magnet misalignments,

00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:54.190
they can be driven by magnetic
fields having a slightly wrong

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:56.450
shape-- all kinds of things.

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:02.420
So that sounds kind
of like a disaster,

00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:05.810
but we do, in fact, as I said,
operate 35,000 accelerators

00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:06.610
quite successfully.

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:08.500
Thank you very much.

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:10.500
But we have always
designed accelerators

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:13.590
to stay away from
these resonances

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:17.150
until a couple of years
ago when we came up

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:20.759
with a new type of accelerator,
which was one of these fixed

00:39:20.759 --> 00:39:22.800
field alternating gradient
machines that I talked

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:23.790
about before.

00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:27.320
But we actually
simplified it right down.

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:28.890
The machine I showed
you before had

00:39:28.890 --> 00:39:31.060
quite a complicated
magnetic field shape.

00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:33.170
And someone said, well,
what happens if we just

00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:35.200
simplify the field and
just use these-- just use

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:37.430
these so-called quadrupole
magnets, which have

00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:41.020
a nice, linear field shape?

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:44.711
And everyone said, well,
you'll get resonances.

00:39:44.711 --> 00:39:45.210
Yeah.

00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:46.030
OK.

00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:52.050
So what we found was that we
have resonances all the way

00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:54.390
through the acceleration cycle.

00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:56.549
But we let it do that
intentionally because one

00:39:56.549 --> 00:39:58.840
of the things you need to
know about resonances is they

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:00.756
need time to build up.

00:40:00.756 --> 00:40:02.380
So this type of
machine-- and it's same

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:04.750
was EMMA, the Electron Model
for Many Applacations--

00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:07.210
was, literally, the first of
its kind in the world where

00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:12.160
we intentionally crossed through
resonances in the acceleration

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:16.100
cycle-- major resonances,
which everyone else said,

00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:17.500
that's never going to work.

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:20.230
But the theory was, if
we went quickly enough,

00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:23.540
we'd be able to cross through
them because there wouldn't

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:25.630
be enough time for those
resonances to build

00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:26.950
up and destroy the beam.

00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:30.170
And that's what we demonstrated
and published back in 2012.

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:33.250
And the plot on the bottom
left of the screen there,

00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:36.880
the lower half of that plot
just shows a red and black line

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:37.740
coming down.

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:41.390
That's our measurement of
what we call the tune-- that

00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:45.289
is, the oscillation
rates-- in this accelerator

00:40:45.289 --> 00:40:47.080
as they're going to
the acceleration cycle.

00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:50.610
So you can see that it sort
of decreases over time.

00:40:50.610 --> 00:40:53.410
And that was our demonstration
that we were, indeed,

00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:54.860
crossing through resonances.

00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:58.120
And we did, indeed, manage
to accelerate particles,

00:40:58.120 --> 00:40:59.790
get them out the
other end, and show

00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:04.360
that, actually, if you go fast
enough, this system works.

00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:08.140
Now unfortunately,
that machine can't

00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:12.880
be applied to very high
intensity very easily.

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:16.530
And there's an
extra complication.

00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:20.390
When we have charged
particles and they're

00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:25.150
all in the same place, we have,
in physics, the Coulomb force--

00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:27.940
literally, the repulsion
of different charges

00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:29.881
against each other.

00:41:29.881 --> 00:41:32.550
It might not have occurred to
people to think, well, hang on,

00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:34.370
there's all these particles,
they're really dense,

00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:36.661
they're going through this
tube-- aren't they repelling

00:41:36.661 --> 00:41:38.180
against each other?

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:38.860
Yes.

00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:39.570
They are.

00:41:39.570 --> 00:41:40.380
And you know what?

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:43.400
It's a real pain.

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:45.330
If it accelerators
were like this

00:41:45.330 --> 00:41:50.310
we had one particle-- one, like
this-- life would be a dream.

00:41:50.310 --> 00:41:51.960
Unfortunately,
the more particles

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:53.740
we try and cram in
there, especially

00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:58.480
in high intensity machines,
the worse our problems get.

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:01.900
Because instead of them having
one oscillation period--

00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:04.725
instead of having one
tune-- all the particles

00:42:04.725 --> 00:42:06.680
are interacting with each other.

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:09.050
They're also, mind you,
interacting with the beam pipe,

00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:10.170
with the magnets.

00:42:10.170 --> 00:42:13.800
There's a lot of electromagnetic
fields going around there.

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:15.790
And so when we have
that diagram where

00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:18.370
I said before we
choose a point--

00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:20.350
it ain't a point anymore.

00:42:20.350 --> 00:42:23.170
Instead, our beam
becomes this spread

00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:26.400
of different particles
where every particle has,

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:29.870
more or less, a different tune.

00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:32.470
And this is really
what limits us

00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:35.110
when it comes to designing
higher and higher intensity

00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:36.050
machines.

00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:37.940
The more particles
we cram in there,

00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:41.890
the bigger this spread gets,
the more resonances we run into,

00:42:41.890 --> 00:42:45.650
the more beam loss we
create, and the more risk

00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:49.980
we have of, literally, melting
the beam pipe of accelerator,

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:52.450
which we can't afford to do.

00:42:52.450 --> 00:42:54.410
So there's a couple
of different ways

00:42:54.410 --> 00:43:00.030
that we could potentially
think about solving that.

00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:02.970
And one way is to design
the type of machine

00:43:02.970 --> 00:43:05.400
that I work on, which is
this fixed field alternating

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:07.620
gradient accelerator.

00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:11.660
But another one is something
a little bit wackier,

00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:13.520
which is to take a
synchrotron and add

00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:17.830
a special insertion of magnets,
which kind of does away

00:43:17.830 --> 00:43:21.160
with the existence, in
the physical questions,

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:24.980
of resonances, which
sounds rather confusing.

00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:25.510
It is.

00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:27.910
It's a very theoretical concept.

00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:30.770
It's called an integral
optics accelerator.

00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:34.840
And that's being driven by
Fermilab in the United States.

00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:36.237
So there are a couple of ideas.

00:43:36.237 --> 00:43:38.570
There are also, of course,
other ways you could do this.

00:43:38.570 --> 00:43:40.630
You could use a giant
linear accelerator,

00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:44.310
although I work on circular ones
because I think, in the future,

00:43:44.310 --> 00:43:46.710
the linear ones will be
too large and costly.

00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:48.760
And I think we
ought to be looking

00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:53.410
at a generation of
smaller, circular machines.

00:43:53.410 --> 00:43:58.380
So that's when we have to come
back to this device over here

00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:00.710
because understanding
how those accelerators

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:02.140
work is really hard.

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:04.430
If I try and run a
simulation of billions--

00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:06.540
literally tens of
billions-- of particles

00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:09.390
in one of these machines
interacting with each other,

00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:12.140
interacting with the beam pipe,
interacting with the magnets,

00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:15.210
generating secondary particles,
doing all kinds of-- this

00:44:15.210 --> 00:44:18.650
takes weeks and weeks, on
huge clusters of computers,

00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:20.600
in order to run a
single simulation

00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:23.380
to see what my beam is doing.

00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:26.420
If I try and study it
in a real accelerator,

00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:28.380
it takes weeks and
weeks of beam time.

00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:31.189
And I showed you before that
these machines are in use

00:44:31.189 --> 00:44:31.730
all the time.

00:44:31.730 --> 00:44:35.210
So the ISIS neutron source,
for example, when that's on,

00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:37.470
it runs 24/7.

00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:41.620
There's very little time for
someone to do a beam study.

00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:43.500
And there's,
particularly, no time

00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:45.450
for anyone to
intentionally lose any beam

00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:49.560
because we can't because it
would generate radiation.

00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:51.630
So a few years ago,
I was wondering,

00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:57.000
how can we study very intense
accelerators in the future

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.280
without building the
accelerator first?

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:02.860
Because it's a pretty big job.

00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:05.050
And that's when I
came across this idea

00:45:05.050 --> 00:45:07.370
for the first time
of the Paul trap.

00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:09.120
And I came across some
papers from a group

00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:10.660
from Hiroshima
university in Japan,

00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:12.680
who I now collaborate with.

00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:19.570
And they are using these
devices to actually study

00:45:19.570 --> 00:45:22.210
beams of particle accelerators
and intense beams,

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:24.520
in particular.

00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:27.590
So this is, I promise,
the only slide

00:45:27.590 --> 00:45:29.880
I have in here with some
serious equations in it.

00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:36.340
This describes the
Hamiltonian of beam motion.

00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:37.756
This is on the lower side.

00:45:37.756 --> 00:45:39.380
And on the left,
that's the Hamiltonian

00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:41.530
for beam motion
in an accelerator.

00:45:41.530 --> 00:45:43.440
Now a Hamiltonian
sort of describes

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:47.450
the overall motion in a system--
the physicist will be familiar.

00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:49.990
If you're not, all I
want you to recognize in

00:45:49.990 --> 00:45:54.270
that equation is how similar
it is to the other one.

00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:58.200
So the other equation
is the Hamiltonian

00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:01.670
for what we call a Paul trap.

00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:04.840
And if you sort of compare
all the different pieces

00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:06.600
of that equation,
you'll see that they're

00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:08.480
very, very similar in form.

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:11.250
And what these colleagues
at Hiroshima University

00:46:11.250 --> 00:46:13.320
had realized is that
they could actually

00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:18.400
use a Paul trap-- a small
one rather than a large one,

00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:21.430
like this-- to actually
study the physics

00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:23.080
of the beams of accelerators.

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:25.950
So just to point out a few
terms in that equation--

00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:28.680
on the left, the
pxpy, that's momentum,

00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:32.000
and then there's a focusing
term, which is the k term,

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.830
and then x squared
minus y, squared,

00:46:33.830 --> 00:46:36.620
which is the sort of the
hyperbolic shape here.

00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:41.370
And then, on the far right
hand side, there's this phi sc.

00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:43.500
And on the left,
there's a phi as well.

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:46.870
This phi is what we call
a space charged term.

00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:51.250
That describes this defocusing,
weird, annoying effect

00:46:51.250 --> 00:46:53.870
from all the high
intensity interactions

00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:57.110
between the different particles.

00:46:57.110 --> 00:47:02.890
So this device I discovered
was able to not just simulate

00:47:02.890 --> 00:47:04.694
the beams in just
about any accelerator--

00:47:04.694 --> 00:47:06.110
because we,
literally, can dial it

00:47:06.110 --> 00:47:11.110
in-- but it was also able to
simulate the intense dynamics

00:47:11.110 --> 00:47:12.650
of those beams.

00:47:12.650 --> 00:47:15.420
And that was very,
very exciting to me.

00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:17.392
So the first thing
I did was I had

00:47:17.392 --> 00:47:19.162
to learn what the
system is like.

00:47:19.162 --> 00:47:20.370
I'm an accelerator physicist.

00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:23.450
I don't I don't use
these things usually.

00:47:23.450 --> 00:47:26.730
So this is an electric
quadrupole trap.

00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:30.900
So the top right there shows
an image of the quadrupole mode

00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:33.320
excitation of one of
these traps, where

00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:37.290
we apply an electric
RF field at 1 megahertz

00:47:37.290 --> 00:47:40.630
and we change that in time--
kind of like we were changing

00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:43.960
this or like we change this
in time, as we spin it.

00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:46.070
And that changing
quadrupole field

00:47:46.070 --> 00:47:49.110
does exactly the same thing that
our focusing in the accelerator

00:47:49.110 --> 00:47:50.120
does.

00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:53.200
But this is fixed
in space, so it's

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:56.262
like a tabletop experiment.

00:47:56.262 --> 00:47:58.470
So in the accelerator, our
beam is traveling through.

00:47:58.470 --> 00:48:00.011
It's going through
magnets like this,

00:48:00.011 --> 00:48:01.320
it's going through RF cavities.

00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:04.870
And it's experiencing these
focusing and defocusing forces.

00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:08.250
In this trap, we take
argon ions, which

00:48:08.250 --> 00:48:11.874
we ionize with a little
gun of electrons,

00:48:11.874 --> 00:48:13.790
and then we do the same
thing, but we actually

00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:16.220
do it in time
instead of in space

00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:18.790
as the beam travels through.

00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:21.240
And so that means that
we can't necessarily

00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:23.090
look at all the
acceleration based effects,

00:48:23.090 --> 00:48:26.180
but we can look at all these
beautiful oscillations,

00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:29.980
resonances, and high
intensity effects as well.

00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:32.780
And so I started working with
these guys a couple of years

00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:33.420
ago.

00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:34.919
And the first thing
we looked at was

00:48:34.919 --> 00:48:37.600
to actually recreate
the EMMA experiment

00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:41.070
that I showed you before
and the resonance crossing

00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:43.490
that happens in that.

00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:47.100
So that brings me now to what
I'm working on at the moment

00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:50.410
as well as designing new
types of accelerators.

00:48:50.410 --> 00:48:54.630
I'm also building one of
these Paul trap devices.

00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:58.470
And one of the things I
find really incredible

00:48:58.470 --> 00:49:02.280
is how, in physics, the
mathematics and the description

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:05.530
of these systems actually
translates between lots

00:49:05.530 --> 00:49:07.700
of different physical systems.

00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:11.640
So the beam in the accelerator,
the beam inside one

00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:14.280
of these Paul
traps, and the beam

00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:18.990
or the particle on this Paul
trap as well actually all

00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:20.700
have the same
equations of motion.

00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:23.230
And we can relate them to one
another and use it to study.

00:49:23.230 --> 00:49:25.720
So this is a picture
of my Paul trap.

00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:28.470
It's called IBEX-- intense
beam experiment-- which

00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:29.950
we're building at the moment.

00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:32.460
And this is a
picture of the design

00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:33.930
and then the manufacture.

00:49:33.930 --> 00:49:36.740
And I'm proud to say that this
is really an up-to-the-minute

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:39.850
discourse because this is
a photograph I, literally,

00:49:39.850 --> 00:49:42.180
took yesterday.

00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:44.980
I went up to [INAUDIBLE]
Laboratory up north

00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:47.550
and I took this photograph
of this chamber, which

00:49:47.550 --> 00:49:49.302
actually just blew me away.

00:49:49.302 --> 00:49:50.690
It's so beautiful.

00:49:50.690 --> 00:49:54.220
It's cleaned for
ultra high vacuum.

00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:58.810
And inside that, is mounted
this Paul trap mechanism.

00:49:58.810 --> 00:50:00.310
And into that, very
soon, we'll also

00:50:00.310 --> 00:50:02.340
have a load of
electrical connections,

00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:04.290
and put the lid
on, pump it down,

00:50:04.290 --> 00:50:06.570
and then we'll be able to
start running experiments

00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:09.910
to explore the intensity
frontiers of accelerators

00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:12.830
with that.

00:50:12.830 --> 00:50:17.230
So I want to come back,
just for a moment,

00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:21.180
to sort of speculate
because I've shown you,

00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:24.590
all the way through, the design
of particle accelerators--

00:50:24.590 --> 00:50:26.280
how they work, how
they're accelerated,

00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:28.050
how we bend the
beam, how we focus,

00:50:28.050 --> 00:50:30.100
and how we supply voltage.

00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:32.490
And there's a load
of technology that's

00:50:32.490 --> 00:50:37.790
come a long, long way in decades
and up to the present day.

00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:40.190
And alongside that, of course--
alongside the development

00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:42.440
of technology and
driving the development

00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:44.910
of that technology--
is the field

00:50:44.910 --> 00:50:48.560
of particle physics, which
a couple of you in the room

00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:49.400
are familiar with.

00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:54.900
But let me go through very
quickly some of the discoveries

00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:55.850
that we've made.

00:50:55.850 --> 00:50:58.780
So I talked before about the
discovery of the electron--

00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:00.780
J.J. Thomson, in this theater.

00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:04.350
Well, the particle which later
became known as the electron

00:51:04.350 --> 00:51:09.350
because, apparently, his
nemesis named it, not him.

00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:12.770
And then we we're looking at
the discovery and understanding

00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:14.650
of the photon.

00:51:14.650 --> 00:51:17.840
And then other types of
slightly stranger particles.

00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:19.000
So there's muons.

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.340
Now I mentioned before, muons
are like heavier versions

00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:23.170
of the electron.

00:51:23.170 --> 00:51:25.650
There's also an even
heavier version of the muon,

00:51:25.650 --> 00:51:28.030
called the tao, which
is further down there,

00:51:28.030 --> 00:51:30.110
in sort of medium
blue, which was only

00:51:30.110 --> 00:51:33.100
discovered in the late '70s.

00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:36.650
So there's three generations of
matter that we've discovered.

00:51:36.650 --> 00:51:39.300
We don't quite understand
why there's three.

00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:43.510
And as well as those particles--
the electron, muon, and tao--

00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:46.310
there's all the ones that make
up the rest of our matter.

00:51:46.310 --> 00:51:49.720
So there's ones that make
up the protons and neutrons

00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:52.335
and those are the quarks.

00:51:52.335 --> 00:51:53.960
So on the left hand
side there, there's

00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:56.170
is down, strange,
up, charm, bottom,

00:51:56.170 --> 00:51:59.139
and, eventually, top, as they
were discovered in series.

00:51:59.139 --> 00:52:00.680
And those are the
six different types

00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:04.970
of quarks which go in-- and
only the up and down versions

00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:08.565
of those quarks go into
making our normal matter.

00:52:08.565 --> 00:52:09.940
Again, there's
three generations.

00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:12.020
We don't know why.

00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:14.680
And then, of course, there's
all the other force carrying

00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:16.660
particles-- things
like the photon, which

00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:19.450
does all the electromagnetic
forces that we've been playing

00:52:19.450 --> 00:52:23.750
with, the gluon, which is
holding the proton and neutron

00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:28.020
together with those quarks,
the W boson and Z boson

00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:30.170
do other sort of
weak contractions,

00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:33.120
and then, of course, recently
discovered as well, the Higgs

00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:36.130
boson, which is the
fundamental mechanism of how

00:52:36.130 --> 00:52:37.850
things get mass.

00:52:37.850 --> 00:52:40.280
That's a very quick rundown
of the standard model

00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:43.327
of particle physics.

00:52:43.327 --> 00:52:45.410
And then, of course, there's
other things in there

00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:47.265
which exist-- there's
neutrinos as well.

00:52:47.265 --> 00:52:49.660
They're really
mysterious particles.

00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:51.280
And those are the
ones, for example,

00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:55.660
that we could generate with the
next generation of intense beam

00:52:55.660 --> 00:52:56.410
accelerators.

00:52:56.410 --> 00:53:00.110
And so we have these different
strands of particle physics

00:53:00.110 --> 00:53:01.700
going into the future.

00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:03.680
But what I'd like
to ask you is, well,

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:06.770
going back to the
start of my lecture,

00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:10.950
and looking at J.J. Thomson, and
his inability to predict what

00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:13.080
we were going to use
the electron for,

00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:17.820
and, admittedly, his complete
inability to predict-- I

00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:19.310
think we're at an
interesting place

00:53:19.310 --> 00:53:23.910
in history at the moment
because of our slight inability,

00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:25.770
ourselves, to predict
how we're going

00:53:25.770 --> 00:53:29.120
to use all of this
knowledge in the future.

00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:32.800
So I've shown you a few
applications of protons.

00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:35.380
There's lots of other
applications of ion beams

00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:36.050
and things.

00:53:36.050 --> 00:53:38.690
Maybe there's applications
of muons in the future.

00:53:38.690 --> 00:53:41.890
But I want to sort of leave you
with the thought that having

00:53:41.890 --> 00:53:48.050
learnt to understand and control
these beams of particles,

00:53:48.050 --> 00:53:51.940
it opens up the question of,
exactly what could we do with

00:53:51.940 --> 00:53:53.900
these beams of particles
and these accelerators

00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:54.990
in the future?

00:53:54.990 --> 00:53:59.420
So in the future, if someone's
going to give a toast

00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:03.280
in my presence, I'd like it
to be something like this--

00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:05.830
I'd like it to be, "to the
particle accelerator...

00:54:05.830 --> 00:54:08.770
May it be of use to everybody."

00:54:08.770 --> 00:54:09.613
Thank you very much.

00:54:14.110 --> 00:54:18.775
I also am aware of people
from the high energy physics

00:54:18.775 --> 00:54:23.542
community investing in plasma
whitefield technologies--

00:54:23.542 --> 00:54:25.000
not only for high
energy, actually,

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:26.470
but also further applications.

00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:28.040
I just wondered if you
had any comments on that?

00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:29.220
Do you think it's a runner?

00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:31.750
Should we be worrying
more about that?

00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:35.270
Or is it interesting?
