00:00:00.223 --> 00:00:02.230
- [Instructor] We are told
the differentiable functions

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:06.323
X and Y are related by
the following equation,

00:00:06.323 --> 00:00:09.388
Y is equal to square root of X.

00:00:09.388 --> 00:00:10.565
And it's interesting, they're telling us

00:00:10.565 --> 00:00:12.742
that they are both
differentiable functions,

00:00:12.742 --> 00:00:16.541
even X is a function, must be
a function of something else.

00:00:16.541 --> 00:00:18.522
Well, they tell us that
the derivative of X

00:00:18.522 --> 00:00:20.439
with respect to T is 12

00:00:21.319 --> 00:00:24.119
and they want us to
find the derivative of Y

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.093
with respect to T when X is equal to nine.

00:00:28.093 --> 00:00:30.237
So, let's just make sure
we can understand this.

00:00:30.237 --> 00:00:34.214
So, they're telling us that
both X and Y are functions.

00:00:34.214 --> 00:00:36.553
Arguably they are both functions of T.

00:00:36.553 --> 00:00:38.097
Y is a function of X

00:00:38.097 --> 00:00:39.602
but then X is a function of T

00:00:39.602 --> 00:00:41.874
so Y could also be a function of T.

00:00:41.874 --> 00:00:43.668
One way to think about it is

00:00:43.668 --> 00:00:45.668
if X is equal to F of T,

00:00:47.764 --> 00:00:51.180
then Y is equal to the square root of X

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.430
which would just be F of T.

00:00:55.273 --> 00:00:56.696
Another way to think about it

00:00:56.696 --> 00:00:58.722
if you took T as your input

00:00:58.722 --> 00:01:00.671
into your function F,

00:01:00.671 --> 00:01:02.838
you're going to produce X

00:01:02.838 --> 00:01:04.578
and then if you took that as your input

00:01:04.578 --> 00:01:06.995
into the square root function

00:01:08.162 --> 00:01:10.941
you are going to produce Y.

00:01:10.941 --> 00:01:14.811
So, you could just view this
as just one big box here,

00:01:14.811 --> 00:01:16.894
that Y is a function of Y

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.459
but now let's actually
answer their question.

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:24.637
To tackle it we just have
to apply the chain rule.

00:01:24.637 --> 00:01:28.316
The chain rule tells us
that the derivative of Y

00:01:28.316 --> 00:01:30.242
with respect to T

00:01:30.242 --> 00:01:33.054
is going to be equal
to the derivative of Y

00:01:33.054 --> 00:01:36.637
with respect to X times
the derivative of X

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:39.675
with respect to T.

00:01:39.675 --> 00:01:42.769
So, let's apply it to
this particular situation.

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:45.428
We're gonna have the derivative of Y

00:01:45.428 --> 00:01:47.239
with respect to T

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:49.822
is equal to the derivative of Y

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.503
with respect to X.

00:01:52.503 --> 00:01:53.745
Well, what's that?

00:01:53.745 --> 00:01:55.843
Well, Y is equal to the
principle root of X.

00:01:55.843 --> 00:01:57.182
You could also write this as Y

00:01:57.182 --> 00:01:59.757
is equal to X to the one half power.

00:01:59.757 --> 00:02:01.380
We could just use the power rule.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.318
The derivative of Y with respect to X

00:02:03.318 --> 00:02:07.233
is one half X to the negative one half.

00:02:07.233 --> 00:02:08.766
So, let me write that down.

00:02:08.766 --> 00:02:11.683
One half X to the negative one half

00:02:12.903 --> 00:02:16.467
and then times the derivative of X

00:02:16.467 --> 00:02:19.085
with respect to T times
the derivative of X

00:02:19.085 --> 00:02:21.356
with respect to T.

00:02:21.356 --> 00:02:24.255
Well, let's see, we wanna find
what we have here in orange,

00:02:24.255 --> 00:02:25.772
that's what the questions asks us.

00:02:25.772 --> 00:02:28.196
They tell us when X is equal to nine

00:02:28.196 --> 00:02:29.385
and the derivative of X

00:02:29.385 --> 00:02:30.986
with respect to T is equal to 12.

00:02:30.986 --> 00:02:32.685
So, we have all of the information

00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:34.604
necessary to solve for this.

00:02:34.604 --> 00:02:38.021
So, this is going to be equal to one half

00:02:39.205 --> 00:02:42.322
times nine to the negative one half,

00:02:42.322 --> 00:02:44.205
nine to the negative one half,

00:02:44.205 --> 00:02:48.372
times DX/DT, the derivative
of X with respect to T

00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:51.584
is equal to 12, times 12.

00:02:52.766 --> 00:02:55.376
So, let's see, nine to the one half

00:02:55.376 --> 00:02:56.671
would be three,

00:02:56.671 --> 00:03:00.001
nine to the negative
one half would be 1/3,

00:03:00.001 --> 00:03:01.493
so this is 1/3,

00:03:01.493 --> 00:03:05.660
so this will all simplify
to 1/2 times 1/3 is 1/6,

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:10.122
so we could have a six in the denominator

00:03:10.122 --> 00:03:14.357
and then we are going to
have a 12 in the numerator.

00:03:14.357 --> 00:03:19.114
So, 12/6, so the derivative
of Y with respect to T

00:03:19.114 --> 00:03:20.300
when X is equal to nine

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.658
and derivative of X with
respect to 12 is two.
