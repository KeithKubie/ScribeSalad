00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.400
I've been doing a bunch of
videos about logarithmic scale.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.110
And we've also, unfortunately,
had many notable earthquakes

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:07.610
this year.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.460
So I thought I would do a video
on the Richter scale, which

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.900
is a way to measure
earthquake magnitudes.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.260
And just to be clear, although
we associate the Richter

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.540
scale as the way we
measure earthquakes now,

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.470
the one that we
actually use now is

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.670
the moment of magnitude scale.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.520
And the reason why
most people don't

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.990
make a huge differentiation
between the two,

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.000
is that the moment
magnitude scale

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.186
was calibrated to
the Richter scale.

00:00:32.186 --> 00:00:34.560
But the whole reason why we
moved to the moment magnitude

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.090
scale is that the Richter
scale starts to kind of max out

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.340
at around magnitude
7 earthquakes.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.150
So this gives us
a much better way

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.180
to measure things that
are above a magnitude 7.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.040
So this right here is a
picture of Charles Richter.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.230
He's passed away.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.386
But this is from an
interview that he gave,

00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:54.260
and it's interesting
because it kind of gives

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.400
the rationale for how he came
up with the Richter scale.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.050
I found a paper by Professor
K. Wadati of Japan,

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.430
in which he compared large
earthquakes by plotting

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.340
the maximum ground motion
against the distance

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.720
to the epicenter.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.030
So this Professor K. Wadati
would, you could imagine,

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.470
he did a plot like this,
where this is distance.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.460
So if you have an
earthquake someplace,

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.936
you aren't always sitting
right on top of the epicenter,

00:01:18.936 --> 00:01:19.810
where you measure it.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.101
You might be sitting over here.

00:01:21.101 --> 00:01:25.620
Your measuring stations
might be some distance away.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.747
So he looks at how far
the measuring station was,

00:01:27.747 --> 00:01:29.330
and then he looks
at the ground motion

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.980
at the measuring station.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.540
So that would be some
earthquake over there.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.870
Let's say that's a
relatively medium earthquake.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.870
This right over here would
be a weak earthquake,

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.610
because you're close
to the earthquake,

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.720
and it still didn't
move the ground much.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.680
This is the magnitude,
this axis is the magnitude,

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.730
how much the ground is moving.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.630
And then, for
example, this would

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.852
be a very strong earthquake.

00:01:51.852 --> 00:01:53.810
And then Charles Richter
said in the interview,

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.120
I tried a similar
procedure for our stations.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.840
But the range between the
largest and smallest magnitudes

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.079
seemed unmanageably large.

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.620
So what he's saying
is, when he tried

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.170
to plot it like
Professor Wadati,

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.539
he found that OK, you
could get some earthquakes

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:08.789
that you can plot around here.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.030
But no matter how you
create a linear scale,

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.740
if you want any
resolution down here,

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.810
the stronger earthquakes
just go off the charts.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:18.999
Or maybe off the page.

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:20.540
So the stronger
earthquakes you might

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.200
have to start plotting
here, or here.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.900
Or maybe they don't
even fit on the page.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.311
And so he says, Doctor
Beno Gutenberg--

00:02:27.311 --> 00:02:29.560
and they were all working
at Caltech when they came up

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.210
with the Richter scale--
Doctor Beno Gutenberg

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.540
then made the natural suggestion
to plot the amplitudes

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.210
logarithmically.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.490
I was lucky, because
logarithmic plots

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:41.980
are a device of the devil.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.540
And I'm not really
sure what he means

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.915
when he says that they
were a device of the devil.

00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:48.040
I'm assuming he means that
they're kind of magical.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.081
That all of a sudden, you
could take these things

00:02:50.081 --> 00:02:52.060
that you want your
resolution down here,

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.340
you want to be able
to tell the difference

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.750
between those weak earthquakes.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.330
But at the same
time, you want to be

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.280
able to compare them to
the large earthquakes.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.863
And he thought, I
guess he viewed them

00:02:59.863 --> 00:03:02.240
as a bit of a
magical instrument.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.320
And we say that
they're logarithmic,

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.270
or he plotted on a
logarithmic scale.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.250
What essentially
he's saying is, he's

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.110
essentially taking the
logarithm of the magnitude

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.887
of every one of
those earthquakes.

00:03:13.887 --> 00:03:15.720
So if you're measuring
the earthquake, maybe

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.070
on a seismograph, so this
is before the earthquake,

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.530
then the earthquake hits.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.050
And then the earthquake stops.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.414
And then you measure the
amplitude of this earthquake.

00:03:24.414 --> 00:03:25.830
If you just plotted
them linearly,

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.210
you would have the
problem that he saw.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.100
Or if you try to plot them the
way Professor Wadati did it,

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.430
you would have that problem.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.138
But what he does is
he measures this now,

00:03:34.138 --> 00:03:37.870
and he plots the
logarithm of that.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.870
And so what happens is that you
get a scale that is plotted--

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.992
or you get a logarithmic scale,
for lack of a better word.

00:03:43.992 --> 00:03:45.450
But what I want to
do in this video

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.460
is think about what
implication that

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.110
has for the magnitude
of earthquakes,

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.860
especially some of the
earthquakes that we

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.241
have seen recently.

00:03:52.241 --> 00:03:53.740
So this right here
is the earthquake

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.610
that occurred August 23, on
the east coast of the United

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:57.119
States.

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:58.910
And it wasn't that
strong of an earthquake.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:59.900
It was a 5.8.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.775
That's not a small earthquake,
you would definitely feel it.

00:04:01.775 --> 00:04:03.399
It's a good bit of
shaking, it can even

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:05.195
cause some minor damage.

00:04:05.195 --> 00:04:06.840
But the reason why
it's notable is

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.840
it happened in a part of
the world that does not

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.710
see earthquakes too frequently.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.900
So let's just take
that on our scale.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.830
I'm going to go down
all the way over here.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.246
So I'm going to
do our scale here.

00:04:16.246 --> 00:04:18.700
So let's just put that as a 5.8.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.970
And if you shake your
seat fairly vigorously,

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.470
that'll give you a
good idea of what

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.810
it might feel like on the
top of that earthquake.

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.695
So this is 2011, east
coast earthquake.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.909
And then probably the
most famous earthquake

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:35.450
in the United States
in recent memory

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.720
was the one that
occurred at Loma Prieta.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.370
This is Loma Prieta
right over here, about 40

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.664
or 50 miles south
of San Francisco.

00:04:42.664 --> 00:04:44.830
And this is damage that was
caused in San Francisco,

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.731
an actual freeway
collapsed right over here.

00:04:46.731 --> 00:04:48.980
And this whole area has
actually now become very nice,

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.730
after they removed this freeway.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.540
But you can imagine
how powerful it

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.270
was, that it was able to cause
this type of damage this far

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.980
away.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.080
And actually I live
right over here,

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.370
so I'm glad I wasn't around,
or I wasn't in the Bay Area,

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.420
during that earthquake.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.700
But that earthquake,
depending on your measurement,

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.080
but we'll just call it a 7.0.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.890
So that earthquake
measured at a 7.0.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.830
So let's call this 7.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.480
Let me do that in a color
you're more likely to see.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.880
So that earthquake was a 7.0.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.650
Loma Prieta, that was in
the San Francisco Bay Area.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.670
And this was in 1989.

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.360
It happened right actually
before the World Series.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.990
And then of course 2011, a
very unfortunate earthquake

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.100
in Japan.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.760
The Tohoku earthquake,
right over here,

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.999
this circle shows the
magnitude of that earthquake.

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:40.790
It was off the coast
of Japan, all of these

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:41.924
were the aftershocks.

00:05:41.924 --> 00:05:43.590
And the real damage
it caused was really

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.920
the tsunami and
the damage it did

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.230
to the Fukushima
nuclear power plant.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.357
But that was an 8.-- well,
sometimes it's called 8.9,

00:05:51.357 --> 00:05:53.440
sometimes a 9.0, depending
on how you measure it--

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.910
let's just call it a
9.0 for simplicity.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.790
So let's say this is almost
6, and this would be 7,

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.150
then an 8 would get
us right over there.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.370
So 9.0 is right over there.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:10.640
So this is 2011 the earthquake
in Japan, the Tohoku

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.410
earthquake.

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.880
And then the largest
earthquake ever recorded

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.530
was the great Chilean
earthquake in 1960.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.050
And that was a 9.5.

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.980
So 9.5 would stick
us right over,

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.350
let's say right over here.

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:28.970
And this is the 1960
earthquake in Chile.

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.520
And just to give a sense,
when you look at this, if you

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.570
thought this was a linear
scale you'd say, OK,

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:34.986
the Chilean
earthquake, maybe that

00:06:34.986 --> 00:06:36.615
was a little bit
less than twice as

00:06:36.615 --> 00:06:37.990
bad as the east
coast earthquake.

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.430
And it doesn't seem too bad.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.050
Until you realize that
it is not a linear scale.

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.380
It is a logarithmic scale.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.450
And the way that
you interpret it

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:52.550
is thinking about how
many powers of 10 one

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.610
of these earthquakes
is from another.

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:57.100
So you can view these
as powers of 10.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:01.470
So if you take, go
from 5.8 to 7.0,

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.840
that was 1.2, a 1.2 difference.

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.590
But remember, this is
a logarithmic scale.

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.215
And I encourage you
to watch the videos

00:07:08.215 --> 00:07:10.050
we made on the
logarithmic scale.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:12.490
On a logarithmic
scale, a fixed distance

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.620
is not a fixed amount of
movement on that scale.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:20.535
Or a change on that scale is
not a fixed linear distance.

00:07:20.535 --> 00:07:22.710
It is actually a scaling factor.

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.050
And you're not scaling
by 1.2 over here.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:27.730
You're scaling by
10 to the 1.2 power.

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:33.270
So this is times 10
to the 1.2 power.

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:35.695
So I'll get my calculator
out right over here.

00:07:35.695 --> 00:07:37.140
And let's figure what that is.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:38.931
So you could imagine
what it's going to be.

00:07:38.931 --> 00:07:40.520
10 to the first power is 10.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.600
And then you have 0.2.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:48.280
So it's going to be, let's just
do it, 10 to the 1.2 power.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.710
It's 15.8.

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:52.170
So it's roughly
16 times stronger.

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:54.760
So whatever shaking that was
just felt on the east coast,

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.176
and maybe some of
you all watching

00:07:56.176 --> 00:07:58.910
this might have felt it,
Loma Prieta earthquake

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:03.210
was 16 times stronger
than the earthquake-- let

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:07.682
me write this-- this is 16
times stronger than the one

00:08:07.682 --> 00:08:09.140
that we just had
on the east coast.

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:10.473
So that's a dramatic difference.

00:08:10.473 --> 00:08:12.910
Even though this caused
some damage, and this

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:17.450
is kind of shaking on
a pretty good scale.

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:19.589
Imagine 16 times
as much shaking.

00:08:19.589 --> 00:08:21.130
And how much damage
that would cause.

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:22.700
I actually just
met a reporter who

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.225
told me that she
was in her backyard

00:08:24.225 --> 00:08:25.641
during the Loma
Prieta earthquake,

00:08:25.641 --> 00:08:27.137
not too far from
where I live now.

00:08:27.137 --> 00:08:29.470
And she says all the cars
were like jumping up and down.

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:31.873
So it was a massive,
massive earthquake.

00:08:31.873 --> 00:08:33.789
Now let's think about
the Japanese earthquake.

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:35.372
We could think about
how much stronger

00:08:35.372 --> 00:08:36.450
it was than Loma Prieta.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:38.120
So remember, this
isn't, you don't just

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:42.240
think of this as just
2 times stronger.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.672
It is 10 to the
second times stronger.

00:08:44.672 --> 00:08:46.130
And we know how to
figure that out.

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:48.240
10 to the second power is 100.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.730
So this right over here.

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:52.370
So cars were jumping up and down
at the Loma Prieta earthquake.

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:56.840
The Japanese earthquake
was 100 times stronger.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:00.230
100 times stronger
than Loma Prieta.

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:02.360
And if you compare it to
the east coast earthquake,

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:08.600
it would be 1,600 times
the east coast earthquake

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.610
that occurred in August of 2011.

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:13.430
So massive, massive,
massive earthquake.

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:15.460
And just to get a sense
of how much stronger

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:18.140
the Chilean earthquake was in
1960-- and just to-- there's

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:22.090
some fascinating outcomes
of the Japanese earthquake.

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:25.010
It was estimated
that Japan, just

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:28.530
over the course of the
earthquake got 13 feet wider.

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:31.830
So this is doing something
to the actual shape

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:35.330
of a huge island.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.340
And on top of that,
it's estimated

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:40.720
that because of the shaking,
and the distortions in earth

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.320
caused by that shaking,
that the day on earth

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.264
got one millionth
of a second shorter.

00:09:46.264 --> 00:09:48.180
A little over a millionth
of a second shorter.

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.870
So you might say, hey, that's
only a millionth of a second.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:51.286
But I'd say, hey,
look it actually

00:09:51.286 --> 00:09:53.300
changed the day of the earth.

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:54.420
A very fundamental thing.

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.711
It actually matters when
people send things into space,

00:09:56.711 --> 00:09:59.064
and probes into
Mars, is that they

00:09:59.064 --> 00:10:00.730
are to be able to
know that our day just

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:03.060
got a millionth of
a second shorter.

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.342
So this was already
a massive quake.

00:10:05.342 --> 00:10:06.800
And the Chilean
earthquake is going

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.440
to be 10 to the 0.5
times stronger than that.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.899
So let's get our calculator out.

00:10:11.899 --> 00:10:14.190
So you really could view this
as the square root of 10.

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:17.310
So 10 to the 0.5 is the
same thing as 10 to the 1/2,

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:20.960
which is just the same thing
as the square root of 10.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.660
Which is 3.16.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:25.200
So the strongest
earthquake on record

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:30.020
was 3.16 times stronger than
the Japanese earthquake.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:31.910
The one that shortened
the day of the planet.

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:35.870
The one that made
Japan 13 feet wider.

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:39.730
And so this was-- if you wanted
to compare it to the east coast

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:41.750
earthquake-- this
would be almost,

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:46.000
or about 5,000 times stronger.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.610
So massive, massive earthquake.

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:50.195
So one, hopefully
that gives you a sense

00:10:50.195 --> 00:10:51.820
of what the Richter
scale is all about.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:53.610
And also gives you a
sense of how massive

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:55.684
some of these super
massive earthquakes are.

00:10:55.684 --> 00:10:58.350
And you can also appreciate what
Charles Richter's first problem

00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:58.850
was.

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:01.340
If you wanted to plot all of
these on the same linear plot,

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:06.310
you would have to stick
this one 5,000 times further

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:08.570
along an axis than you would
have to stick this one.

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:12.460
And this one itself, this is
still a pretty big earthquake.

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.640
So this would have to be
5,000 times further than some

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:19.380
of the earthquakes at the
low end of the Richter scale.
