00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.969
You share a certain percentage of your genome with

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:05.750
each different type of family member in your family

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.158
tree. For example, we'll start with you. You are

00:00:09.158 --> 00:00:13.270
100% related to you and to every other family member

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.160
you're going to be less genetically related unless, of course,

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.890
you have an identical twin. Now we've discussed a

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.870
few of these relationships. And a few of the

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.320
percentages that you would be with each individual family member.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.450
But I want you to see if you can fill in the rest

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.420
of this family tree a percentage relationships. Using the options that you see

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.380
here in the number bank. Now this could be a little bit tricky,

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.190
so take the time to think about each person would relate back to you.
