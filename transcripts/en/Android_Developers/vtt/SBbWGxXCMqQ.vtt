00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.117
Android Studio is
evolving rapidly.

00:00:02.117 --> 00:00:04.200
If you'd like to get a
preview of the next release

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.140
but don't want to risk
your productivity,

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.460
you can keep two copies of
Android Studio installed

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.820
side-by-side.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.510
If you haven't already, start by
downloading the stable release

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.180
from the Android Developer site.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.920
Then, head over to
tools.android.com and grab

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.330
a copy of the
latest Canary build.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.606
Install each into
different locations.

00:00:21.606 --> 00:00:22.980
Now of course,
the whole point is

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.150
to keep a stable build
on one and the cutting

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.930
edge on the other.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.920
So open up the Preferences
on your stable installation,

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.510
navigate to System
Settings and Updates,

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.580
and make sure the
Automatically Check Updates

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.380
checkbox is checked.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.320
Then select Stable.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.940
Now do the same for your preview
installation, only this time

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.749
select the Canary channel
from the Update settings.

00:00:42.749 --> 00:00:45.290
You've also got the option of
setting either channel to Beta,

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.290
which is the channel used
for release candidates

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.507
before they're pushed
out through Stable.

00:00:49.507 --> 00:00:51.840
You can change the channel
used for updating your stable

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.460
or preview installation
at any time.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.040
Either case, if you encounter
a bug, use the Help,

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.720
Submit Feedback menu
to file a bug directly

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.370
with the Android Studio team.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.720
You'll be notified of new
versions of Android Studio

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.700
for the relevant
channel on restart,

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.930
or you can force a
check by selecting Check

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.330
For Updates at any time.
