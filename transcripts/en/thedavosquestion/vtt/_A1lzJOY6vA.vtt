Daniel: Hi my name is Dan Shapiro, I am director
of the Harvard International Negotiation program,

00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:09.830
and it's an honor to talk with you all today
on the YouTube community.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:17.289
A global priority as I see it is to build
more effective processes, institutions, ways

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:23.199
of dealing with conflict. Conflict that has
a huge cost on our society today.

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:28.029
There was a recent study done in the Middle
East showing that in the past twenty years,

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:34.130
the cost of conflict has been approximately
twelve trillion dollars.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.800
Imagine what that region would look like with
a surplus of that nature, what the institutions

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.100
could look of education and so on.
Thats just the Middle East, we look at the

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.140
rest of the world as well. The cost of conflict
is huge, and what can we do about it.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.490
The problem is that our world is very focused
right now on reacting to conflict. On dealing

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:00.440
with it after the fact. Assuming that destructive
conflict, violent conflict is a natural state

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.870
of human being, rather than saying what can
we do to try to prevent violent conflict,

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.210
destructive conflict from occurring in the
first place.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.460
Myself and a number people at global [Inaudible]
council here at the world economic forum,

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.290
one that focuses on negotiation, colleagues
at Harvard, are all at a concerted way working

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.720
to build new models, new ways practically
of preventing violent conflict before it even

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.990
occurs.
One of the things I would encourage you to

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:35.370
do and all of us to do is to try to build
into our educational system and institutions

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.861
curriculum, trainings on conflicts resolution
and negotiation so that we could build the

00:01:40.861 --> 00:01:45.490
capacity for peace and for people to deal
with conflict more effectively, ultimately

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.299
towards a more secure and stable world.
I look forward to hearing all of the good

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.340
work you are doing and thank you for listening
to me today.
