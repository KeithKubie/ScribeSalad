00:00:04.365 --> 00:00:06.275
Hi, everybody, and welcome
to TensorFlow Meets.

00:00:06.275 --> 00:00:09.335
It's my great honor today 
to be chatting with Megan Kacholia,

00:00:09.335 --> 00:00:11.765
Engineering Director, right?
on TensorFlow.

00:00:11.765 --> 00:00:14.425
So can you tell us a little bit more
about what it is that you do?

00:00:14.425 --> 00:00:17.845
Sure. I'm an Engineering Director
on the TensorFlow team.

00:00:17.845 --> 00:00:22.205
I've been with the team for a little
over two-and-a-half years now.

00:00:22.205 --> 00:00:24.975
I've gotten to participate 
in all of the Dev Summits

00:00:24.975 --> 00:00:27.055
- which has been really exciting.
- Nice.

00:00:27.055 --> 00:00:30.235
Just to get to come, be part 
of the keynote, be part of the event.

00:00:30.605 --> 00:00:32.765
In terms of what I actually do,

00:00:33.186 --> 00:00:36.036
I'm one of the leads 
for the TensorFlow team.

00:00:36.427 --> 00:00:38.312
I just help with, obviously,
the team itself,

00:00:38.312 --> 00:00:40.077
make sure we're going
in the right direction,

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.470
and make sure that we're doing 
the right things by our community.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.010
One of the things that you spoke about

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.010
that I saw that a lot of people
are excited about

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.610
and I know I'm personally excited about

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.400
is just really how we're doubling down
on making it very developer-friendly

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.660
- in TensorFlow.
- Yes.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.190
How do that come about,
can you tell us a bit more about it?

00:00:56.851 --> 00:01:00.301
Obviously we've taken 
a lot of feedback from the community,

00:01:00.301 --> 00:01:02.111
just to see what are the pain points,

00:01:02.111 --> 00:01:04.751
what works well, what doesn't,
I think that's a big part of it.

00:01:05.341 --> 00:01:07.681
And just in general TensorFlow
has been around--

00:01:07.681 --> 00:01:10.361
We just had our third birthday
in November, right?

00:01:10.747 --> 00:01:13.977
So, things change, or the industry
is really moving quickly,

00:01:13.977 --> 00:01:16.797
machine learning is advancing 
in lots of different places

00:01:16.797 --> 00:01:20.067
than we might have anticipated 
when TensorFlow was first developed.

00:01:20.067 --> 00:01:22.827
So we need to make sure 
that we're making it very, very easy

00:01:22.827 --> 00:01:26.587
for folks to just come in, get started,
and be able to take advantage

00:01:26.587 --> 00:01:28.347
of all of the cool things happening

00:01:28.347 --> 00:01:30.207
- in the machine learning space.
- Right.

00:01:30.207 --> 00:01:32.527
I really think it comes 
from kind of both of those angles,

00:01:32.527 --> 00:01:33.937
just how things have moved so fast,

00:01:33.937 --> 00:01:36.067
and just the feedback 
we've gotten from the community

00:01:36.067 --> 00:01:38.257
as we've had TensorFlow 
out there for a few years.

00:01:38.257 --> 00:01:40.357
I've been working on it 
for about a year and a half

00:01:40.357 --> 00:01:42.007
and I came in with a developer background

00:01:42.007 --> 00:01:44.817
and when I started trying 
to kick the tires on TensorFlow,

00:01:44.817 --> 00:01:47.047
there were some things
where it was like...

00:01:47.047 --> 00:01:48.717
it just wasn't quite intuitive to me.

00:01:48.717 --> 00:01:51.037
But a lot of that 
has been changing, right?

00:01:51.037 --> 00:01:52.357
There's stuff like Keras

00:01:52.357 --> 00:01:53.817
- and other things,
- That's correct.

00:01:53.817 --> 00:01:56.147
and the eager execution
by default that you've been adding

00:01:56.147 --> 00:01:58.667
just hopefully will make it
a lot easier for other developers.

00:01:58.667 --> 00:02:00.957
(Megan) That's correct. 
We want to make sure, obviously,

00:02:00.957 --> 00:02:04.747
that the flexibility and the power
of TensorFlow is there,

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:08.439
but also make sure it's approachable
and easy for people to just come in

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:10.469
and be like, it's fine,
start here on this surface,

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:12.149
and if you need to dive down to this part

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:14.929
and really get into the guts of it,
you can, it's fantastic,

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:16.819
but you don't have to
if you don't need to.

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.699
(Laurence) Right. 
And all of this doesn't come

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:20.069
at the cost of performance, right?

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.269
Because you had that great slide
with performance and...

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.819
Can you tell us a little bit 
about the performance improvements

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.429
that you've been seeing with TensorFlow?

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:28.319
(Megan) So a lot of those 
improvements as well

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.139
while we're looking at just 
kind of the core TensorFlow, right,

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:33.209
kind of you think of like the heart of it,

00:02:33.588 --> 00:02:35.768
and that's where the majority
of the improvements come,

00:02:35.768 --> 00:02:38.578
meaning that those improvements
will be applicable

00:02:38.578 --> 00:02:40.788
whether we're talking 
about TensorFlow 2.0

00:02:40.788 --> 00:02:43.788
or whether we're talking about
using Keras or something else.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.160
It's that big meaty part 
kind of under the hood.

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:49.089
And a lot of it comes

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:52.829
from just better making use 
of the different types of hardware,

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.389
making sure that we're using the different
types of accelerators appropriately,

00:02:56.949 --> 00:03:00.329
understanding the limitations 
and restrictions for things like mobile.

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.969
We talked about a lot of improvements
for performance on TF Lite as well,

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:05.959
and again, some of it
is just understanding

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.639
what do the [workflows] really look like,

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:10.069
what does it look like 
on some of these different devices

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.069
and Edge TPUs and things that we're trying
in TensorFlow out more with now,

00:03:14.377 --> 00:03:17.237
and then kind of always going back
and closing the loop and being like,

00:03:17.237 --> 00:03:20.087
okay, this is how we can make it better
and this is how we can make sure

00:03:20.087 --> 00:03:22.437
that the users get 
that performance by default,

00:03:22.437 --> 00:03:24.257
and don't have to necessarily know

00:03:24.257 --> 00:03:26.907
what magic had to happen 
under the covers for it to happen,

00:03:26.907 --> 00:03:28.117
they should just get it.

00:03:28.117 --> 00:03:31.007
(Laurence) Right. Now, you mentioned
a mobile with TensorFlow Lite.

00:03:31.007 --> 00:03:32.957
We lovingly call it TF Lite.

00:03:33.784 --> 00:03:36.034
One of the things that I do get
a lot of questions about

00:03:36.034 --> 00:03:40.034
is that there's all of these different 
almost parts of the family of TensorFlow,

00:03:40.293 --> 00:03:43.083
and can you give us a quick summary
of the different runtimes

00:03:43.083 --> 00:03:44.803
that are available for developers,

00:03:44.803 --> 00:03:47.493
between TensorFlow Lite and,
what are those other?

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.510
(Megan) So there's TensorFlow Lite,

00:03:49.774 --> 00:03:51.714
there's more higher level types of things

00:03:51.714 --> 00:03:53.854
that we talked about 
with TensorFlow Extended,

00:03:53.854 --> 00:03:56.214
so that's not neccessarily 
a different runtime

00:03:56.214 --> 00:03:59.144
but it's more kind of just how 
you put things together end to end,

00:03:59.144 --> 00:04:02.144
especially if you're looking more 
towards a production environment.

00:04:03.023 --> 00:04:07.853
We talked a bit about JavaScript as well,
so TensorFlow.js,

00:04:08.138 --> 00:04:11.538
and I think that one,
it's a language-type thing,

00:04:11.538 --> 00:04:13.978
because you want to make sure 
that the JavaScript community--

00:04:13.978 --> 00:04:15.978
it's such a large community--
that they have access

00:04:15.978 --> 00:04:17.468
to machine learning as well,

00:04:17.468 --> 00:04:20.528
but there's also just 
the whole in-browser experience

00:04:20.751 --> 00:04:23.481
that it plugs in well with 
because of Node.js.

00:04:23.899 --> 00:04:26.499
So I think a lot of it depends 
on what kind of applications

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:28.239
people are interested in

00:04:28.239 --> 00:04:31.019
and kind of where they're coming
at machine learning from.

00:04:31.019 --> 00:04:33.509
There are so many different ways
of applying machine learning,

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:36.499
whether you're thinking of it like,
"Oh, I work in a large company,

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:38.349
so I need it for
these enterprise use cases,"

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:41.069
or "I'm just an app developer,
I'm trying things out myself,"

00:04:41.429 --> 00:04:43.689
or "I'm someone who's really
familiar with this language,

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:45.149
I'm really familiar with JavaScript,

00:04:45.149 --> 00:04:47.319
so that means I can use that
as kind of my entryway

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:49.969
to start doing other things
in machine learning."

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:52.559
So some of it depends on where you're at,

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:53.859
where you're coming from,

00:04:53.859 --> 00:04:56.279
and then we try and make sure
we have the right way for you

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:58.009
to get into the machine
learning community.

00:04:58.009 --> 00:04:59.799
The JavaScript stuff 
is amazing in the fact

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:02.119
that you can actually 
train models in the browser.

00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:03.249
(Megan) Yes.

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:06.019
When I first heard about that, 
I was like "Nah, come on, really?"

00:05:06.372 --> 00:05:09.152
- But you actually can do that, so...
- (Megan) Yes, it's really cool.

00:05:09.152 --> 00:05:12.322
And as you mentioned that with Node
you're not just limited to in the browser,

00:05:12.322 --> 00:05:14.812
you can also run it on backend servers
and that kind of stuff.

00:05:14.812 --> 00:05:17.782
One of my personal favorites actually,
is with things like Cloud Functions

00:05:17.782 --> 00:05:20.022
or Cloud Functions for Firebase
because they run Node.js,

00:05:20.022 --> 00:05:21.902
you can actually start 
putting models in there.

00:05:21.902 --> 00:05:24.492
Now, TensorFlow 2.0 is currently
an alpha release, right?

00:05:24.492 --> 00:05:26.462
Now, lots of people are asking
what comes next,

00:05:26.462 --> 00:05:29.192
when are we going to see a release
candidate or something like that?

00:05:29.192 --> 00:05:31.962
Yeah, so like we talked about
at the Dev Summit,

00:05:31.962 --> 00:05:36.462
we're going to have our release candidate
kind of coming up sometime in Q2.

00:05:36.462 --> 00:05:38.415
We want to make sure 
that we're giving ourselves

00:05:38.415 --> 00:05:41.475
enough time to make sure
we have good performance,

00:05:41.475 --> 00:05:44.445
make sure we have the right fit,
finish, and polish for everything,

00:05:44.742 --> 00:05:47.442
but there is, like you said, 
an alpha available.

00:05:47.442 --> 00:05:49.152
We want feedback from the community.

00:05:49.152 --> 00:05:51.692
We want to understand 
what are people enjoying,

00:05:51.692 --> 00:05:54.082
what's working well, 
what are they concerned about.

00:05:54.572 --> 00:05:56.522
And you can also follow along on GitHub

00:05:56.522 --> 00:05:58.792
and kind of see 
what features are coming out,

00:05:58.792 --> 00:06:00.502
what status are things at.

00:06:00.502 --> 00:06:02.592
That way the community 
knows what's going on

00:06:02.592 --> 00:06:04.832
and we can make sure 
that we're engaged appropriately

00:06:04.832 --> 00:06:06.402
to be building the right things

00:06:06.402 --> 00:06:09.312
as we finalize and finish up
with the 2.0 release.

00:06:09.312 --> 00:06:10.652
Sound perfect. Thank you!

00:06:10.652 --> 00:06:13.892
So people can stay tuned to GitHub
and keep track of everything

00:06:13.892 --> 00:06:15.872
- that's going on.
- (Megan) Yeah, that's correct.

00:06:15.872 --> 00:06:17.152
Thank you so much, Megan.

00:06:17.152 --> 00:06:20.252
And thanks, everybody, for watching
this episode of TensorFlow Meets.

00:06:20.252 --> 00:06:22.692
