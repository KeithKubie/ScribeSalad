00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.730
Artificial intelligence is one of the
hottest fields on the planet today. It has

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.810
taken decades to develop the basic
algorithms in fields such as search,

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:30.680
logic, planning, probabilistic reasoning.
Those skills you can leverage into many,

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.940
many AI applications. This AI Nanodegree program is taught with my friends

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.860
and colleagues, Thad Starner from Georgia Tech
and Peter Norvig from Google, and of course, myself.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.790
So I hope you enroll and I hope
you can enjoy AI as much as I have

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.130
throughout my career. I'll see you in class!
