00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:31.779
quantum computer and this is what came
up so well all right so the starting

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:31.789
up so well all right so the starting
 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:33.699
up so well all right so the starting
point for this talk is that there are

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:33.709
point for this talk is that there are
 

00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:36.249
point for this talk is that there are
certain technologies that would be

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:36.259
certain technologies that would be
 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:38.259
certain technologies that would be
really great if we had them I would

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:38.269
really great if we had them I would
 

00:05:38.269 --> 00:05:40.209
really great if we had them I would
certainly love them and yet we we never

00:05:40.209 --> 00:05:40.219
certainly love them and yet we we never
 

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:42.429
certainly love them and yet we we never
seem to see them okay and you can ask

00:05:42.429 --> 00:05:42.439
seem to see them okay and you can ask
 

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:45.009
seem to see them okay and you can ask
why not the first one of these is warp

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:45.019
why not the first one of these is warp
 

00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:47.679
why not the first one of these is warp
drive okay you know you know we've been

00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:47.689
drive okay you know you know we've been
 

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:49.389
drive okay you know you know we've been
watching it you know in science fiction

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:49.399
watching it you know in science fiction
 

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:50.499
watching it you know in science fiction
where is it

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:50.509
where is it
 

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:55.509
where is it
okay we're waiting so the second is the

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:55.519
okay we're waiting so the second is the
 

00:05:55.519 --> 00:05:57.579
okay we're waiting so the second is the
perpetual motion machine okay this is

00:05:57.579 --> 00:05:57.589
perpetual motion machine okay this is
 

00:05:57.589 --> 00:06:00.040
perpetual motion machine okay this is
clearly the only long-term solution to

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050
clearly the only long-term solution to
 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.319
clearly the only long-term solution to
the world's energy problems okay again

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:02.329
the world's energy problems okay again
 

00:06:02.329 --> 00:06:05.980
the world's energy problems okay again
you know why we can describe it why

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990
you know why we can describe it why
 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.790
you know why we can describe it why
don't we say it okay and now the third

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800
don't we say it okay and now the third
 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.999
don't we say it okay and now the third
maybe a little bit less common but I

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:13.009
maybe a little bit less common but I
 

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:15.429
maybe a little bit less common but I
think just as interesting it's what I'll

00:06:15.429 --> 00:06:15.439
think just as interesting it's what I'll
 

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:18.249
think just as interesting it's what I'll
call the uber computer okay so this is a

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:18.259
call the uber computer okay so this is a
 

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:22.629
call the uber computer okay so this is a
computer that sort of instantly answers

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:22.639
computer that sort of instantly answers
 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:25.269
computer that sort of instantly answers
any well posed mathematical question

00:06:25.269 --> 00:06:25.279
any well posed mathematical question
 

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:26.829
any well posed mathematical question
that you can put to it all right I'm not

00:06:26.829 --> 00:06:26.839
that you can put to it all right I'm not
 

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:28.509
that you can put to it all right I'm not
even going to talk about asking it the

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:28.519
even going to talk about asking it the
 

00:06:28.519 --> 00:06:30.069
even going to talk about asking it the
meaning of life or something like that

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:30.079
meaning of life or something like that
 

00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:32.499
meaning of life or something like that
okay I'm just asking that it should

00:06:32.499 --> 00:06:32.509
okay I'm just asking that it should
 

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:35.309
okay I'm just asking that it should
instantly answer you know any any

00:06:35.309 --> 00:06:35.319
instantly answer you know any any
 

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:38.469
instantly answer you know any any
mathematical question okay and you know

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:38.479
mathematical question okay and you know
 

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:40.269
mathematical question okay and you know
despite whether it may sometimes seem

00:06:40.269 --> 00:06:40.279
despite whether it may sometimes seem
 

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:41.890
despite whether it may sometimes seem
like we don't have that

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:41.900
like we don't have that
 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.350
like we don't have that
you know even the fastest computers on

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.360
you know even the fastest computers on
 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.480
you know even the fastest computers on
earth if you ask them some problem about

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:46.490
earth if you ask them some problem about
 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.210
earth if you ask them some problem about
a finding the proof of some hard theorem

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:49.220
a finding the proof of some hard theorem
 

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.129
a finding the proof of some hard theorem
they may not be able to do it within the

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:51.139
they may not be able to do it within the
 

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:53.350
they may not be able to do it within the
entire lifetime of the universe okay and

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.360
entire lifetime of the universe okay and
 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.029
entire lifetime of the universe okay and
in fact this is why there are still

00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:55.039
in fact this is why there are still
 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:59.529
in fact this is why there are still
human mathematicians today okay so okay

00:06:59.529 --> 00:06:59.539
human mathematicians today okay so okay
 

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:01.719
human mathematicians today okay so okay
so so now you know when we when we when

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:01.729
so so now you know when we when we when
 

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:03.430
so so now you know when we when we when
we look at these three devices we can

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:03.440
we look at these three devices we can
 

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.159
we look at these three devices we can
ask why do they seem to be impossible

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:06.169
ask why do they seem to be impossible
 

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:08.680
ask why do they seem to be impossible
what why do we not have them is that is

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:08.690
what why do we not have them is that is
 

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.499
what why do we not have them is that is
it just limitations of engineering that

00:07:11.499 --> 00:07:11.509
it just limitations of engineering that
 

00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:14.080
it just limitations of engineering that
you know no one has put cranks and

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:14.090
you know no one has put cranks and
 

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:15.550
you know no one has put cranks and
levers together and the right way to

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:15.560
levers together and the right way to
 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.740
levers together and the right way to
build them well at least in the first

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:17.750
build them well at least in the first
 

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.080
build them well at least in the first
two cases we have a pretty good idea

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:20.090
two cases we have a pretty good idea
 

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.480
two cases we have a pretty good idea
that the answer is no that in fact the

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:22.490
that the answer is no that in fact the
 

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.180
that the answer is no that in fact the
impossibility of these devices is linked

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:25.190
impossibility of these devices is linked
 

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:27.310
impossibility of these devices is linked
to some of the deepest principles in

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:27.320
to some of the deepest principles in
 

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.300
to some of the deepest principles in
physics okay so in the first case we

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:31.310
physics okay so in the first case we
 

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:33.610
physics okay so in the first case we
don't have faster than light travel or

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:33.620
don't have faster than light travel or
 

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.370
don't have faster than light travel or
communication because special relativity

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:36.380
communication because special relativity
 

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.500
communication because special relativity
tells us that the structure of

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:38.510
tells us that the structure of
 

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:40.510
tells us that the structure of
space-time just doesn't permit that if

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:40.520
space-time just doesn't permit that if
 

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.939
space-time just doesn't permit that if
you were to go faster than light you're

00:07:42.939 --> 00:07:42.949
you were to go faster than light you're
 

00:07:42.949 --> 00:07:45.219
you were to go faster than light you're
also going backwards in time okay in the

00:07:45.219 --> 00:07:45.229
also going backwards in time okay in the
 

00:07:45.229 --> 00:07:47.080
also going backwards in time okay in the
second case we don't have perpetual

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:47.090
second case we don't have perpetual
 

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:48.939
second case we don't have perpetual
motion machines because they would

00:07:48.939 --> 00:07:48.949
motion machines because they would
 

00:07:48.949 --> 00:07:50.969
motion machines because they would
violate the second law of thermodynamics

00:07:50.969 --> 00:07:50.979
violate the second law of thermodynamics
 

00:07:50.979 --> 00:07:53.890
violate the second law of thermodynamics
okay so what about the third case you

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:53.900
okay so what about the third case you
 

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.469
okay so what about the third case you
know is the third case just sort of a

00:07:56.469 --> 00:07:56.479
know is the third case just sort of a
 

00:07:56.479 --> 00:07:58.899
know is the third case just sort of a
technological accident or is there also

00:07:58.899 --> 00:07:58.909
technological accident or is there also
 

00:07:58.909 --> 00:08:01.420
technological accident or is there also
some Funt fundamental physical reasons

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:01.430
some Funt fundamental physical reasons
 

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:04.270
some Funt fundamental physical reasons
why we don't see Boober computers okay

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:04.280
why we don't see Boober computers okay
 

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.010
why we don't see Boober computers okay
so in this talk I'm going to try to

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:06.020
so in this talk I'm going to try to
 

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:08.529
so in this talk I'm going to try to
convince you that sort of the limits of

00:08:08.529 --> 00:08:08.539
convince you that sort of the limits of
 

00:08:08.539 --> 00:08:11.379
convince you that sort of the limits of
computation are also like these other

00:08:11.379 --> 00:08:11.389
computation are also like these other
 

00:08:11.389 --> 00:08:13.899
computation are also like these other
two examples telling us something

00:08:13.899 --> 00:08:13.909
two examples telling us something
 

00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:16.240
two examples telling us something
important about the physical world okay

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:16.250
important about the physical world okay
 

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:17.350
important about the physical world okay
and that therefore they're something

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:17.360
and that therefore they're something
 

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.540
and that therefore they're something
that not just computer scientists but

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:19.550
that not just computer scientists but
 

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:21.250
that not just computer scientists but
also physicists should be worried about

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:21.260
also physicists should be worried about
 

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.540
also physicists should be worried about
and in fact that maybe we can even turn

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:24.550
and in fact that maybe we can even turn
 

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:28.360
and in fact that maybe we can even turn
it around and use it to to say something

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:28.370
it around and use it to to say something
 

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:31.899
it around and use it to to say something
new about physics okay all right so this

00:08:31.899 --> 00:08:31.909
new about physics okay all right so this
 

00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:34.750
new about physics okay all right so this
talk is going to require like a five

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:34.760
talk is going to require like a five
 

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.750
talk is going to require like a five
minute crash course in some of the

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:36.760
minute crash course in some of the
 

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.360
minute crash course in some of the
fundamental concepts of my own field of

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:40.370
fundamental concepts of my own field of
 

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:43.199
fundamental concepts of my own field of
computational complexity theory okay so

00:08:43.199 --> 00:08:43.209
computational complexity theory okay so
 

00:08:43.209 --> 00:08:46.440
computational complexity theory okay so
I'll go quickly through this okay but

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:46.450
I'll go quickly through this okay but
 

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:49.960
I'll go quickly through this okay but
basically in in theoretical computer

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:49.970
basically in in theoretical computer
 

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:52.660
basically in in theoretical computer
science and the field of complexity

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:52.670
science and the field of complexity
 

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:55.440
science and the field of complexity
theory were interested in problems

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:55.450
theory were interested in problems
 

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:57.480
theory were interested in problems
and how fast you can solve them or what

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:57.490
and how fast you can solve them or what
 

00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:59.370
and how fast you can solve them or what
kind of resources you need to solve them

00:08:59.370 --> 00:08:59.380
kind of resources you need to solve them
 

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.350
kind of resources you need to solve them
okay now what do we mean by a problem

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:01.360
okay now what do we mean by a problem
 

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.690
okay now what do we mean by a problem
well you know the standard example would

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:03.700
well you know the standard example would
 

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:07.320
well you know the standard example would
be I sort of just some infinite sequence

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:07.330
be I sort of just some infinite sequence
 

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.960
be I sort of just some infinite sequence
of yes-or-no questions okay so for

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:09.970
of yes-or-no questions okay so for
 

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:12.720
of yes-or-no questions okay so for
example I would give you a flight map

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:12.730
example I would give you a flight map
 

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:15.420
example I would give you a flight map
and I would ask you is every airport

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:15.430
and I would ask you is every airport
 

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:17.520
and I would ask you is every airport
reachable from every other one in five

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:17.530
reachable from every other one in five
 

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:21.060

okay now the size of an instance usually

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:05.860
okay now the size of an instance usually
 

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.860
okay now the size of an instance usually
just means the number of bits needed to

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:07.870
just means the number of bits needed to
 

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:10.260
just means the number of bits needed to
write it down okay or you can think

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:10.270
write it down okay or you can think
 

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:12.990
write it down okay or you can think
interchangeably like in this example the

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:13.000
interchangeably like in this example the
 

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.460
interchangeably like in this example the
size of the instance is going to be

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:14.470
size of the instance is going to be
 

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:17.280

roughly the number of cities okay
 

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:19.860
roughly the number of cities okay
and now we we would like algorithms that

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:19.870
and now we we would like algorithms that
 

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:22.320
and now we we would like algorithms that
solve these problems and usually you

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:22.330
solve these problems and usually you
 

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.120
solve these problems and usually you
know there's some trivial way to solve

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:24.130
know there's some trivial way to solve
 

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:25.290
know there's some trivial way to solve
it which is that you could just

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:25.300
it which is that you could just
 

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:28.020
it which is that you could just
enumerate all of the possibilities okay

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:28.030
enumerate all of the possibilities okay
 

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:29.610
enumerate all of the possibilities okay
but we don't want that we want some way

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:29.620
but we don't want that we want some way
 

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:32.130
but we don't want that we want some way
to solve the problem efficiently okay

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:32.140
to solve the problem efficiently okay
 

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:34.800
to solve the problem efficiently okay
now so what do we mean by efficient so

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:34.810
now so what do we mean by efficient so
 

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:37.050
now so what do we mean by efficient so

it uses a number of steps that grows
 

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:45.420
it uses a number of steps that grows
basically like the size of the instance

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:45.430
basically like the size of the instance
 

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:47.790
basically like the size of the instance
to some fixed power okay so it could

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:47.800
to some fixed power okay so it could
 

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.730
to some fixed power okay so it could
grow like N or like N squared that's

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:50.740
grow like N or like N squared that's
 

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:51.720
grow like N or like N squared that's
also okay

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:51.730
also okay
 

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:53.880
also okay
it could even grow like n to the hundred

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:53.890
it could even grow like n to the hundred
 

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:55.620
it could even grow like n to the hundred
which doesn't sound very efficient but

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:55.630
which doesn't sound very efficient but
 

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:57.720
which doesn't sound very efficient but
you know it doesn't tend to come up very

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:57.730
you know it doesn't tend to come up very
 

00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:00.060
you know it doesn't tend to come up very
often in practice okay what it shouldn't

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:00.070
often in practice okay what it shouldn't
 

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:02.400
often in practice okay what it shouldn't
do is grow like 2 to the N okay that's

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:02.410
do is grow like 2 to the N okay that's
 

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:03.980
do is grow like 2 to the N okay that's
exponential growth and

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:03.990
exponential growth and
 

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:06.050
exponential growth and
that that's what we don't want okay so

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:06.060
that that's what we don't want okay so
 

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:08.750
that that's what we don't want okay so

that for a while okay but on the other
 

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:01.130
that for a while okay but on the other
hand if I gave you the factors then you

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:01.140
hand if I gave you the factors then you
 

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:02.480
hand if I gave you the factors then you
know you could multiply them together

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:02.490
know you could multiply them together
 

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:05.180
know you could multiply them together
and say oh I guess I guess it did have a

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:05.190
and say oh I guess I guess it did have a
 

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:07.460
and say oh I guess I guess it did have a
factor ending in 7 okay that that

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:07.470
factor ending in 7 okay that that
 

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:09.410
factor ending in 7 okay that that
wouldn't be as hard of a computation

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:09.420
wouldn't be as hard of a computation
 

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:11.389
wouldn't be as hard of a computation
certainly not for a computer you know it

00:13:11.389 --> 00:13:11.399
certainly not for a computer you know it
 

00:13:11.399 --> 00:13:13.819
certainly not for a computer you know it
can multiply numbers pretty quickly okay

00:13:13.819 --> 00:13:13.829
can multiply numbers pretty quickly okay
 

00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:17.070
can multiply numbers pretty quickly okay
so all right so so

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:17.080
so all right so so
 

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:20.670
so all right so so
now there's this concept of an np-hard

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:20.680
now there's this concept of an np-hard
 

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:23.700
now there's this concept of an np-hard
problem a problem is called np-hard

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:23.710
problem a problem is called np-hard
 

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:26.280
problem a problem is called np-hard
basically if it captures the difficulty

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:26.290
basically if it captures the difficulty
 

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:28.470
basically if it captures the difficulty
of every NP problem so basically these

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:28.480
of every NP problem so basically these
 

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.660
of every NP problem so basically these
are the problems that if you had a way

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:30.670
are the problems that if you had a way
 

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:33.120
are the problems that if you had a way
to solve them then you could use that to

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:33.130
to solve them then you could use that to
 

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:35.910
to solve them then you could use that to
solve all of the NP problems okay

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:35.920
solve all of the NP problems okay
 

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:40.170
solve all of the NP problems okay
now the final concept is a problem is

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:40.180
now the final concept is a problem is
 

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:43.440
now the final concept is a problem is
called np-complete if it's both np-hard

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:43.450
called np-complete if it's both np-hard
 

00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:46.680
called np-complete if it's both np-hard
and it's in NP okay so basically the

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:46.690
and it's in NP okay so basically the
 

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:49.260
and it's in NP okay so basically the
np-complete problems are the hardest

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:49.270
np-complete problems are the hardest
 

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:51.660
np-complete problems are the hardest
problems for which it's easy to check

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:51.670
problems for which it's easy to check
 

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:55.740
problems for which it's easy to check
the solution okay so you know you have

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:55.750
the solution okay so you know you have
 

00:13:55.750 --> 00:14:00.210
the solution okay so you know you have
to think about that for a bit but but

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:00.220
to think about that for a bit but but
 

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:02.130
to think about that for a bit but but
you know you know you know this sounds

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:02.140
you know you know you know this sounds
 

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:04.110
you know you know you know this sounds
like just playing around with words but

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:04.120
like just playing around with words but
 

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:07.920
like just playing around with words but
the profound discovery that people made

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:07.930
the profound discovery that people made
 

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:10.620
the profound discovery that people made
in the 1970s that really started this

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:10.630
in the 1970s that really started this
 

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:14.700
in the 1970s that really started this
whole field of complexity theory you

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:14.710
whole field of complexity theory you
 

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:16.550
whole field of complexity theory you
know in the in its sort of modern

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560
know in the in its sort of modern
 

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:19.890
know in the in its sort of modern
incarnation was that a huge number of

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:19.900
incarnation was that a huge number of
 

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:22.290
incarnation was that a huge number of
practical problems that people care

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:22.300
practical problems that people care
 

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.840
practical problems that people care
about you know actually all belong to

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:24.850
about you know actually all belong to
 

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:29.700
about you know actually all belong to
this np-complete class okay so you know

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:29.710
this np-complete class okay so you know
 

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:32.130
this np-complete class okay so you know
problems from physics from economics

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:32.140
problems from physics from economics
 

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:34.710
problems from physics from economics
from biology from you know all kinds of

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:34.720
from biology from you know all kinds of
 

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:37.500
from biology from you know all kinds of
fields you know now one one famous

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:37.510
fields you know now one one famous
 

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:39.540
fields you know now one one famous
example is what's called the Hamilton

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:39.550
example is what's called the Hamilton
 

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:41.910
example is what's called the Hamilton
cycle problem okay so here I would show

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:41.920
cycle problem okay so here I would show
 

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:44.250
cycle problem okay so here I would show
you a map like this with a bunch of

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:44.260
you a map like this with a bunch of
 

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.470
you a map like this with a bunch of
cities the yellow dots and some are

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:46.480
cities the yellow dots and some are
 

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.360
cities the yellow dots and some are
connected to each other and I would ask

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:48.370
connected to each other and I would ask
 

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:50.790
connected to each other and I would ask
you this is there a way to is there a

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:50.800
you this is there a way to is there a
 

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.130
you this is there a way to is there a
tour that visits each city exactly once

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:53.140
tour that visits each city exactly once
 

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:55.350
tour that visits each city exactly once
okay now in this case there is one

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:55.360
okay now in this case there is one
 

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.090
okay now in this case there is one
what's that okay and if I show it to you

00:14:57.090 --> 00:14:57.100
what's that okay and if I show it to you
 

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:58.830
what's that okay and if I show it to you
then it's not hard to check it and say

00:14:58.830 --> 00:14:58.840
then it's not hard to check it and say
 

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:02.220
then it's not hard to check it and say
yes indeed it you know it solves the

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:02.230
yes indeed it you know it solves the
 

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:03.990
yes indeed it you know it solves the
problem okay but if I don't show you the

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:04.000
problem okay but if I don't show you the
 

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.460
problem okay but if I don't show you the
tour then you know you may have to think

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:05.470
tour then you know you may have to think
 

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:07.860
tour then you know you may have to think
about it and and as the number of cities

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:07.870
about it and and as the number of cities
 

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:10.170
about it and and as the number of cities
increases the difficulty of the problem

00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:10.180
increases the difficulty of the problem
 

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.900
increases the difficulty of the problem
may you know increase a lot okay it's

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:12.910
may you know increase a lot okay it's
 

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:14.790
may you know increase a lot okay it's
like or think of solving a jigsaw puzzle

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:14.800
like or think of solving a jigsaw puzzle
 

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.740
like or think of solving a jigsaw puzzle
that's another example of an np-complete

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:16.750
that's another example of an np-complete
 

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:19.980
that's another example of an np-complete

importance okay you know airline
 

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:29.329
importance okay you know airline
scheduling things like things like that

00:15:29.329 --> 00:15:29.339
scheduling things like things like that
 

00:15:29.339 --> 00:15:30.320
scheduling things like things like that
okay

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:30.330
okay
 

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:33.769
okay
so it's to give you the brief layout of

00:15:33.769 --> 00:15:33.779
so it's to give you the brief layout of
 

00:15:33.779 --> 00:15:36.889
so it's to give you the brief layout of
the world so at the very bottom we have

00:15:36.889 --> 00:15:36.899
the world so at the very bottom we have
 

00:15:36.899 --> 00:15:39.560
the world so at the very bottom we have
paid sir you know I think of all of the

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:39.570
paid sir you know I think of all of the
 

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:42.199
paid sir you know I think of all of the
problems for which you know we know a

00:15:42.199 --> 00:15:42.209
problems for which you know we know a
 

00:15:42.209 --> 00:15:44.540
problems for which you know we know a
feasible way to solve them with today's

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:44.550
feasible way to solve them with today's
 

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:47.180
feasible way to solve them with today's
computers okay so you know and there's

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:47.190
computers okay so you know and there's
 

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:49.280
computers okay so you know and there's
lots and lots of non-obvious things in

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:49.290
lots and lots of non-obvious things in
 

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:50.870
lots and lots of non-obvious things in
here like testing whether a number is

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880
here like testing whether a number is
 

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.820
here like testing whether a number is
prime or composite

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:52.830
prime or composite
 

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:54.710
prime or composite
you know linear programming lots of

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:54.720
you know linear programming lots of
 

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.600
you know linear programming lots of
interesting stuff okay but then above it

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:56.610
interesting stuff okay but then above it
 

00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:58.400
interesting stuff okay but then above it
you know there's this whole class of

00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:58.410
you know there's this whole class of
 

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:00.650
you know there's this whole class of
problems you know and be complete ones

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:00.660
problems you know and be complete ones
 

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:04.040
problems you know and be complete ones
for which no one knows of any efficient

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:04.050
for which no one knows of any efficient
 

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:06.889
for which no one knows of any efficient
way to solve them you know and most of

00:16:06.889 --> 00:16:06.899
way to solve them you know and most of
 

00:16:06.899 --> 00:16:08.630
way to solve them you know and most of
us believe that there isn't one okay

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:08.640
us believe that there isn't one okay
 

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:10.670
us believe that there isn't one okay
this is also a huge class containing

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:10.680
this is also a huge class containing
 

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:14.990
this is also a huge class containing
lots and lots of practical problems you

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:15.000
lots and lots of practical problems you
 

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.699
lots and lots of practical problems you
know and then certainly there's plenty

00:16:16.699 --> 00:16:16.709
know and then certainly there's plenty
 

00:16:16.709 --> 00:16:18.410
know and then certainly there's plenty
of stuff that's even harder than NP

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:18.420
of stuff that's even harder than NP
 

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:23.090
of stuff that's even harder than NP
complete okay one famous example is the

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:23.100
complete okay one famous example is the
 

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.550
complete okay one famous example is the
halting problem I give you a program you

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:25.560
halting problem I give you a program you
 

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:26.870
halting problem I give you a program you
want to know whether it will ever stop

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:26.880
want to know whether it will ever stop
 

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:29.569
want to know whether it will ever stop
running or not okay and then very

00:16:29.569 --> 00:16:29.579
running or not okay and then very
 

00:16:29.579 --> 00:16:31.400
running or not okay and then very
interestingly there are these problems

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:31.410
interestingly there are these problems
 

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:33.110
interestingly there are these problems
that that we think lie in an

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.120
that that we think lie in an
 

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.930
that that we think lie in an
intermediate region between P and NP

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:35.940
intermediate region between P and NP
 

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:38.540
intermediate region between P and NP
complete ok so there are NP problems

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:38.550
complete ok so there are NP problems
 

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:39.560
complete ok so there are NP problems
that are floating in the middle

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:39.570
that are floating in the middle
 

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:41.810
that are floating in the middle
somewhere and a famous example of that

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:41.820
somewhere and a famous example of that
 

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:44.150
somewhere and a famous example of that
is one I already showed you this problem

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.160
is one I already showed you this problem
 

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.850
is one I already showed you this problem
of factoring large numbers okay and as

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:46.860
of factoring large numbers okay and as
 

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:49.280
of factoring large numbers okay and as

Grisha Pearlman you know and several
 

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:08.860
Grisha Pearlman you know and several
others okay but in my opinion P versus

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:08.870
others okay but in my opinion P versus
 

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:11.260
others okay but in my opinion P versus
NP is actually manifestly the most

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:11.270
NP is actually manifestly the most
 

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:13.750
NP is actually manifestly the most
important of the seven problems it's the

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:13.760
important of the seven problems it's the
 

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.430
important of the seven problems it's the
greatest mathematical problem and the

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:15.440
greatest mathematical problem and the
 

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.890
greatest mathematical problem and the
argument for this is simply that if P

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:17.900
argument for this is simply that if P
 

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:20.560
argument for this is simply that if P
were equal to NP then probably you could

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:20.570
were equal to NP then probably you could
 

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:22.960
were equal to NP then probably you could
not only solve that one problem but also

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:22.970
not only solve that one problem but also
 

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:25.720
not only solve that one problem but also
the other six okay because you would

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:25.730
the other six okay because you would
 

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:27.880
the other six okay because you would
simply program your computer to find the

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:27.890
simply program your computer to find the
 

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:32.020
simply program your computer to find the
proofs for you okay so this is a math

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:32.030
proofs for you okay so this is a math
 

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:34.270
proofs for you okay so this is a math
problem but it's also a problem about

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:34.280
problem but it's also a problem about
 

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:36.460
problem but it's also a problem about
the nature of mathematical reasoning

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:36.470
the nature of mathematical reasoning
 

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:39.430
the nature of mathematical reasoning

flooding me with emails is this correct
or not I look you know I I could tell

or not I look you know I I could tell
 

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:52.960

that it almost certainly wasn't correct

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:52.970
that it almost certainly wasn't correct
 

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:55.090
that it almost certainly wasn't correct
but I I didn't know where a mistake was

so I'll supplemented by $200,000 okay
 

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:04.220
so I'll supplemented by $200,000 okay

can tackle questions like this one but

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:31.080
can tackle questions like this one but
 

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:33.500
can tackle questions like this one but
but in the meantime you know we can

but in the meantime you know we can
 

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:35.539

think we can continue to think about P

00:22:35.539 --> 00:22:35.549
think we can continue to think about P
 

00:22:35.549 --> 00:22:38.120

question which it is and that's great

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:40.500
question which it is and that's great
 

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:42.650
question which it is and that's great
okay but there's also a different

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:42.660
okay but there's also a different
 

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:44.930
okay but there's also a different
perspective that we can take on it okay

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:44.940
perspective that we can take on it okay
 

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:47.000
perspective that we can take on it okay
and that's that there's actually a very

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:47.010
and that's that there's actually a very
 

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:49.789
and that's that there's actually a very
important presupposition that sort of

00:22:49.789 --> 00:22:49.799
important presupposition that sort of
 

00:22:49.799 --> 00:22:52.190
important presupposition that sort of
underlies that P versus NP question or

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:52.200
underlies that P versus NP question or
 

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.930
underlies that P versus NP question or
you know why why do we ask the question

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:53.940
you know why why do we ask the question
 

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:56.090
you know why why do we ask the question
in this particular way and not some

00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:56.100
in this particular way and not some
 

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:58.490
in this particular way and not some
other way okay and that presupposition

00:22:58.490 --> 00:22:58.500
other way okay and that presupposition

is called the extended church touring
thesis basically this is the thesis that

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:05.360
thesis basically this is the thesis that
 

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:09.080
thesis basically this is the thesis that

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:09.090
the this theoretical model of a computer
 

00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:10.940
the this theoretical model of a computer
that we've been working with since the

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:10.950
that we've been working with since the
 

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:13.460
that we've been working with since the
1930s which is called the Turing machine

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:13.470
1930s which is called the Turing machine
 

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:17.150
1930s which is called the Turing machine
is really the right model for what can

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:17.160
is really the right model for what can
 

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:19.669
is really the right model for what can
be computed in a reasonable amount of

00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679
be computed in a reasonable amount of

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:21.330
time in the in the physical universe
 

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:25.310
time in the in the physical universe
okay so you know there was an original

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:25.320
okay so you know there was an original
 

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:27.289
okay so you know there was an original
Church touring thesis which said that

00:23:27.289 --> 00:23:27.299
Church touring thesis which said that
 

00:23:27.299 --> 00:23:30.200
Church touring thesis which said that
the touring machine captures what if

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:30.210
the touring machine captures what if
 

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:32.120
the touring machine captures what if
something can be computed in any amount

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:32.130
something can be computed in any amount
 

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:34.220
something can be computed in any amount
of time in the physical world then it

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:34.230
of time in the physical world then it
 

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:35.870
of time in the physical world then it
can also be computed by a Turing machine

00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:35.880
can also be computed by a Turing machine
 

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:38.390
can also be computed by a Turing machine
okay and that I say it's fair to say I

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:38.400
okay and that I say it's fair to say I
 

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:39.710
okay and that I say it's fair to say I
think that there's been no serious

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:39.720
think that there's been no serious
 

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.930
think that there's been no serious
challenge to that thesis not even

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:41.940
challenge to that thesis not even
 

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:43.580
challenge to that thesis not even
quantum computing does anything to

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:43.590
quantum computing does anything to
 

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:45.409
quantum computing does anything to
challenge that okay but then there's the

00:23:45.409 --> 00:23:45.419
challenge that okay but then there's the
 

00:23:45.419 --> 00:23:47.630
challenge that okay but then there's the
extended version which says that if

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:47.640
extended version which says that if
 

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:49.909
extended version which says that if
something can be efficiently computed

00:23:49.909 --> 00:23:49.919
something can be efficiently computed
 

00:23:49.919 --> 00:23:52.789
something can be efficiently computed
computed in polynomial time in the

00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:52.799
computed in polynomial time in the
 

00:23:52.799 --> 00:23:54.980
computed in polynomial time in the
physical world then it can also be

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:54.990
physical world then it can also be
 

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:58.430
physical world then it can also be
computed in polynomial time by a Turing

00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440
computed in polynomial time by a Turing
 

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.890
computed in polynomial time by a Turing
machine either a deterministic or maybe

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:00.900
machine either a deterministic or maybe
 

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:03.440
machine either a deterministic or maybe
a probabilistic one okay and that thesis

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:03.450
a probabilistic one okay and that thesis
 

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:05.419
a probabilistic one okay and that thesis
has always been on shaky err ground and

00:24:05.419 --> 00:24:05.429
has always been on shaky err ground and
 

00:24:05.429 --> 00:24:07.159
has always been on shaky err ground and
in fact you know you're going to see

00:24:07.159 --> 00:24:07.169
in fact you know you're going to see
 

00:24:07.169 --> 00:24:09.740
in fact you know you're going to see
shortly that quantum computing poses a

00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:09.750
shortly that quantum computing poses a
 

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:15.620
shortly that quantum computing poses a
serious challenge to it okay so so you

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:15.630
serious challenge to it okay so so you
 

00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:18.590
serious challenge to it okay so so you
know so so we could ask

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:18.600
know so so we could ask
 

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:20.930
know so so we could ask
you know how okay just in general how

00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:20.940
you know how okay just in general how
 

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:23.390
you know how okay just in general how
sure are we of this thesis you know what

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:23.400
sure are we of this thesis you know what
 

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.040
sure are we of this thesis you know what
are the challenges to it that have been

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:25.050
are the challenges to it that have been
 

00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:27.590
are the challenges to it that have been
put forward over the years all right so

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:27.600
put forward over the years all right so
 

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.900
put forward over the years all right so
let's start with sort of the challenges

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:29.910
let's start with sort of the challenges
 

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:32.330
let's start with sort of the challenges
that have been to these extended

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:32.340
that have been to these extended
 

00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:34.070
that have been to these extended

scientists have sort of kicked around

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.000
scientists have sort of kicked around
 

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.620
scientists have sort of kicked around
since the 1970s or so so my personal

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:39.630
since the 1970s or so so my personal
 

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:42.919
since the 1970s or so so my personal
favorite is that you could violate the

00:24:42.919 --> 00:24:42.929
favorite is that you could violate the
 

00:24:42.929 --> 00:24:46.040
favorite is that you could violate the
extended church-turing thesis and exceed

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:46.050
extended church-turing thesis and exceed
 

00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:48.590

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:54.500
machine using a tub of soapy water okay
so how exactly would that work okay so

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:54.510
so how exactly would that work okay so
 

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:56.690
so how exactly would that work okay so
what you would do is you would take two

00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:56.700
what you would do is you would take two
 

00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:00.110
what you would do is you would take two
glass plates and you would put pegs

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:00.120
glass plates and you would put pegs
 

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:01.730
glass plates and you would put pegs
between them you know in whatever

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:01.740
between them you know in whatever
 

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:04.280
between them you know in whatever
configuration you wanted okay and then

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:04.290
configuration you wanted okay and then
 

00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:07.400
configuration you wanted okay and then
you would you know take this thing and

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:07.410
you would you know take this thing and
 

00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:09.740
you would you know take this thing and
dump it you know just hold it that into

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:09.750
dump it you know just hold it that into
 

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:12.710
dump it you know just hold it that into
a tub of soapy water and you would take

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720
a tub of soapy water and you would take
 

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.780
a tub of soapy water and you would take
it out and what you see is some soap

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:14.790
it out and what you see is some soap
 

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:17.090
it out and what you see is some soap
bubbles which will form okay and in

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:17.100
bubbles which will form okay and in
 

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:19.460
bubbles which will form okay and in
general bubbles like to reach a minimum

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:19.470
general bubbles like to reach a minimum
 

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:21.890
general bubbles like to reach a minimum
energy configuration and this more or

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:21.900
energy configuration and this more or
 

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:24.350
energy configuration and this more or
less corresponds to minimizing the total

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:24.360
less corresponds to minimizing the total
 

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:27.020

length of bubbles connecting the pegs
 

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:30.110
length of bubbles connecting the pegs
together okay and so in other words you

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.120
together okay and so in other words you
 

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:32.030
together okay and so in other words you
know if the bubbles really relax into

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:32.040
know if the bubbles really relax into
 

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:34.340
know if the bubbles really relax into
the lowest energy state then they ought

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:34.350
the lowest energy state then they ought
 

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:37.040
the lowest energy state then they ought
to relax into what computer scientists

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:37.050
to relax into what computer scientists
 

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:38.750
to relax into what computer scientists
and mathematicians know as the minimum

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:38.760
and mathematicians know as the minimum
 

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:41.360
and mathematicians know as the minimum
Steiner tree okay so this is the minimum

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:41.370
Steiner tree okay so this is the minimum
 

00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:44.360

a bunch of points in the Euclidean plane
 

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:50.870
a bunch of points in the Euclidean plane
where those segments could meet could

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:50.880
where those segments could meet could
 

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.760
where those segments could meet could
also meet at intermediate points okay so

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:52.770
also meet at intermediate points okay so
 

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:58.700
also meet at intermediate points okay so
I've shown an example here now the

00:25:58.700 --> 00:25:58.710
I've shown an example here now the
 

00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:01.669
I've shown an example here now the
interesting thing is that this minimum

00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:01.679
interesting thing is that this minimum
 

00:26:01.679 --> 00:26:03.560

np-hard okay and yet nature seems to
 

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:08.450
np-hard okay and yet nature seems to
solve it you just you know dip these

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:08.460
solve it you just you know dip these
 

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:10.400
solve it you just you know dip these
pegs in the soapy water right and just

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:10.410
pegs in the soapy water right and just
 

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:12.830

let nature find the lowest energy State

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:12.840
let nature find the lowest energy State
 

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:14.960
let nature find the lowest energy State
okay so there was a discussion of this

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:14.970
okay so there was a discussion of this
 

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:17.960
okay so there was a discussion of this
on the internet some years ago and you

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:17.970
on the internet some years ago and you
 

00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:19.910
on the internet some years ago and you
know people made the the point that I

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:19.920
know people made the the point that I
 

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:22.700
know people made the the point that I
think was important here which is that

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:22.710
think was important here which is that
 

00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:25.370
think was important here which is that
well systems in nature you know can can

00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:25.380
well systems in nature you know can can
 

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:27.980
well systems in nature you know can can
be amazing and trying to find solutions

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:27.990
be amazing and trying to find solutions
 

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:31.040
be amazing and trying to find solutions
to optimization problems but we also

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:31.050
to optimization problems but we also
 

00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:31.400
to optimization problems but we also
know

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:31.410
know
 

00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:33.340
know
that they can get stuck in local minima

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:33.350
that they can get stuck in local minima
 

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:36.380
that they can get stuck in local minima
okay so for example if you had a rock

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:36.390
okay so for example if you had a rock
 

00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:39.140
okay so for example if you had a rock
and some crevice and a mountainside it

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:39.150
and some crevice and a mountainside it
 

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:41.420
and some crevice and a mountainside it
could reach a lower state of potential

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:41.430
could reach a lower state of potential
 

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:43.970
could reach a lower state of potential
energy by rolling up first and then

energy by rolling up first and then
 

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.680
energy by rolling up first and then
rolling down and yet it's rarely

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:45.690
rolling down and yet it's rarely
 

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:49.820
rolling down and yet it's rarely
observed to do that okay so you know why

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:49.830
observed to do that okay so you know why
 

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:51.920
observed to do that okay so you know why
not why why shouldn't things be the same

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:51.930
not why why shouldn't things be the same
 

00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:53.930
not why why shouldn't things be the same
with these pegs right there might be

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:53.940
with these pegs right there might be
 

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:57.400
with these pegs right there might be
some you know completely optimal way to

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:57.410
some you know completely optimal way to
 

00:26:57.410 --> 00:26:59.750
some you know completely optimal way to
connect the pegs together but if you've

00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760
connect the pegs together but if you've
 

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:04.790
connect the pegs together but if you've
you know put put together a system of

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:04.800
you know put put together a system of
 

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:08.840
you know put put together a system of
pegs such that the minimum Steiner tree

connecting them together encodes a proof
of the Riemann hypothesis which in

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:13.530
of the Riemann hypothesis which in
 

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:15.770

completeness tells you right then you

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:18.480
completeness tells you right then you
 

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:19.970
completeness tells you right then you
know why on earth would you expect

people were arguing with this and they

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:32.250
people were arguing with this and they
 

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:34.010
people were arguing with this and they
said well you know this is just really

00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:34.020
said well you know this is just really

ever actually went and did the

00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:39.660
ever actually went and did the
 

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:42.200
ever actually went and did the
experiment so this was my only for a in

my life into experimental physics so I
 

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:48.230
my life into experimental physics so I
went to the hardware store did it it

00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240
went to the hardware store did it it
 

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.660
went to the hardware store did it it
looks very it's very cool with like five

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:50.670
looks very it's very cool with like five
 

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:52.390
looks very it's very cool with like five
or six pegs you should actually try it

00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:52.400
or six pegs you should actually try it
 

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.650
or six pegs you should actually try it
it's nice but then you know you start

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:54.660
it's nice but then you know you start
 

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:56.960
it's nice but then you know you start
adding more pegs seven pegs eight pegs

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:56.970
adding more pegs seven pegs eight pegs
 

00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:58.820
adding more pegs seven pegs eight pegs
and indeed you can find that sometimes

00:27:58.820 --> 00:27:58.830
and indeed you can find that sometimes
 

00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:00.470
and indeed you can find that sometimes
it does not reach an optimal

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:00.480
it does not reach an optimal
 

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.480
it does not reach an optimal
configuration okay sometimes you even

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:02.490
configuration okay sometimes you even
 

00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:05.210

have cycles which which which which we
know actually can't be optimal it has to

00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:07.140
know actually can't be optimal it has to
 

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:10.760
know actually can't be optimal it has to
be a tree okay so alright so so much for

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:10.770
be a tree okay so alright so so much for
 

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:13.160
be a tree okay so alright so so much for
this there are other approaches that

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:13.170
this there are other approaches that
 

00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:15.050
this there are other approaches that
people have put forward for trying to

00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:15.060
people have put forward for trying to
 

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:19.040
people have put forward for trying to
solve np-complete problems in in nature

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:19.050
solve np-complete problems in in nature
 

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:23.230

they somehow fold very quickly into some
 

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:31.310
they somehow fold very quickly into some
low energy state and if you formalize

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:31.320

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:34.970
this problem in the right way you can
actually show that the problem of

00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:34.980
actually show that the problem of
 

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:37.460

np-complete okay and yet again the

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:41.970
np-complete okay and yet again the
 

00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:44.560
np-complete okay and yet again the
proteins do it okay but again the res

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:44.570
proteins do it okay but again the res
 

00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:49.720

know billions of years so that the

00:28:54.909 --> 00:28:54.919
know billions of years so that the
 

00:28:54.919 --> 00:28:56.889

easy to find okay so that it will be an
 

00:28:59.179 --> 00:29:01.690
easy to find okay so that it will be an
easy computational problem if you you

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:01.700
easy computational problem if you you
 

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:04.149

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:06.200
hard computational problem then there's
 

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.529
hard computational problem then there's
sort of no very good reason to expect it

00:29:08.529 --> 00:29:08.539
sort of no very good reason to expect it
 

00:29:08.539 --> 00:29:11.200
sort of no very good reason to expect it
to reach its minimum energy state okay

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:11.210
to reach its minimum energy state okay
 

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:13.180
to reach its minimum energy state okay
and in fact even in nature we do

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:13.190
and in fact even in nature we do
 

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:15.310

sometimes see proteins that fold into

00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:15.320
sometimes see proteins that fold into
 

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:18.129
sometimes see proteins that fold into
the quote unquote wrong configuration so

okay people have also proposed using DNA

00:29:25.269 --> 00:29:25.279
okay people have also proposed using DNA
 

00:29:25.279 --> 00:29:27.070

computers which would be this massively
 

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:29.680
computers which would be this massively
parallel you know a way of trying to

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:29.690

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:34.690
solve these hard optimization problems
but from our perspective DNA computer is

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:34.700
but from our perspective DNA computer is
 

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:36.700
but from our perspective DNA computer is
really sort of a very very parallel

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:36.710
really sort of a very very parallel
 

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:38.830
really sort of a very very parallel
classical computer so in other words the

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:38.840
classical computer so in other words the
 

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:40.960
classical computer so in other words the
amount of DNA that you need to put in

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:40.970
amount of DNA that you need to put in
 

00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:42.639
amount of DNA that you need to put in
your test tube will increase

00:29:42.639 --> 00:29:42.649
your test tube will increase
 

00:29:42.649 --> 00:29:44.379
your test tube will increase
exponentially with the size of the

00:29:44.379 --> 00:29:44.389
exponentially with the size of the
 

00:29:44.389 --> 00:29:45.639
exponentially with the size of the
problem that you're trying to solve

00:29:45.639 --> 00:29:45.649
problem that you're trying to solve
 

00:29:45.649 --> 00:29:48.190
problem that you're trying to solve
until you you know have to convert the

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:48.200
until you you know have to convert the
 

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:50.919
until you you know have to convert the
whole earth into DNA or something okay

00:29:50.919 --> 00:29:50.929
whole earth into DNA or something okay
 

00:29:50.929 --> 00:29:53.879
whole earth into DNA or something okay
so this again is not a scalable solution

00:29:53.879 --> 00:29:53.889
so this again is not a scalable solution
 

00:29:53.889 --> 00:29:57.100
so this again is not a scalable solution
all right ah but what about quantum

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:57.110
all right ah but what about quantum
 

00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:59.169
all right ah but what about quantum

it sort of it took a while for you know
 

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:47.760
it sort of it took a while for you know
this to really sink in but I think in

it means you have an exponential

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:06.160
it means you have an exponential
 

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:08.580
it means you have an exponential
slowdown okay what Fineman you know and

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:08.590

build your computer out of quantum
 

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:17.130
build your computer out of quantum
mechanical elements and then you know

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:17.140
mechanical elements and then you know
 

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:18.900

you won't have that exponential slowdown
 

00:33:18.910 --> 00:33:20.940
you won't have that exponential slowdown
problem okay but then what you've really

00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:20.950
problem okay but then what you've really
 

00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:23.130
problem okay but then what you've really
built is a fundamentally new kind of

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:23.140

solve some problems exponentially faster
 

00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:29.790
solve some problems exponentially faster
than any of the computers that we use

00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:29.800
than any of the computers that we use
 

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:31.919
than any of the computers that we use
today so then you could ask what else is

00:33:31.919 --> 00:33:31.929
today so then you could ask what else is
 

00:33:31.929 --> 00:33:34.799
today so then you could ask what else is
it good for besides you know the just

00:33:34.799 --> 00:33:34.809
it good for besides you know the just
 

00:33:34.809 --> 00:33:36.750
it good for besides you know the just
the task of simulating quantum physics

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:36.760
the task of simulating quantum physics
 

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.340
the task of simulating quantum physics
which is sort of what just what it could

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:38.350
which is sort of what just what it could
 

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:42.299
which is sort of what just what it could
do in its sleep okay so yeah I like to

00:33:42.299 --> 00:33:42.309
do in its sleep okay so yeah I like to
 

00:33:42.309 --> 00:33:44.250
do in its sleep okay so yeah I like to
describe quantum computing as the power

00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:44.260
describe quantum computing as the power
 

00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:46.770
describe quantum computing as the power
of 2 to the N complex numbers working

00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:46.780
of 2 to the N complex numbers working
 

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:52.090
of 2 to the N complex numbers working
for you

00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:52.100
 
 

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:54.220
 
okay now as I guess is well known

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:54.230
okay now as I guess is well known
 

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:57.580
okay now as I guess is well known
actually building a scalable a quantum

00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:57.590
actually building a scalable a quantum
 

00:33:57.590 --> 00:34:00.550
actually building a scalable a quantum
computer turns out to be damn hard and

00:34:00.550 --> 00:34:00.560
computer turns out to be damn hard and
 

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:03.220
computer turns out to be damn hard and
the basic reason is that once a quantum

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:03.230
the basic reason is that once a quantum
 

00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:06.370
the basic reason is that once a quantum
computer state is measured then it

00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:06.380
computer state is measured then it
 

00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:08.770
computer state is measured then it
reverse to being classical okay you sort

00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:08.780
reverse to being classical okay you sort
 

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:10.540
reverse to being classical okay you sort
of you know a quantum computer is in

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:10.550
of you know a quantum computer is in
 

00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:12.370
of you know a quantum computer is in
what's called this superposition with

00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:12.380
what's called this superposition with
 

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:14.590
what's called this superposition with
all these different amplitudes for all

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:14.600
all these different amplitudes for all
 

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.240
all these different amplitudes for all
the different possible states that it

00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:16.250
the different possible states that it
 

00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:18.370
the different possible states that it
could be in okay but once you measure it

00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:18.380
could be in okay but once you measure it
 

00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:20.800
could be in okay but once you measure it
you force it to make up its mind okay

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:20.810
you force it to make up its mind okay
 

00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:23.640
you force it to make up its mind okay
and and then it's just in one state and

00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:23.650
and and then it's just in one state and
 

00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:26.100
and and then it's just in one state and
and you know you know you don't get to

00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:26.110
and you know you know you don't get to
 

00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:29.080
and you know you know you don't get to
measure twice one you know once once you

00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:29.090
measure twice one you know once once you
 

00:34:29.090 --> 00:34:30.580
measure twice one you know once once you
measure you get an answer out then it's

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:30.590
measure you get an answer out then it's
 

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:34.180
measure you get an answer out then it's
gone okay so and this applies not just

00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:34.190
gone okay so and this applies not just
 

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:35.740
gone okay so and this applies not just
for for measurements that you would do

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:35.750
for for measurements that you would do
 

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:37.870
for for measurements that you would do
but for measurements that are implicitly

00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:37.880
but for measurements that are implicitly
 

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:40.240
but for measurements that are implicitly
performed by any stray particle that may

00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:40.250
performed by any stray particle that may
 

00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:42.880
performed by any stray particle that may
happen to pass through your system okay

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:42.890
happen to pass through your system okay
 

00:34:42.890 --> 00:34:44.950
happen to pass through your system okay
and so so what this means is that to

00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:44.960
and so so what this means is that to
 

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:47.500
and so so what this means is that to
build a scalable quantum computer you

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:47.510
build a scalable quantum computer you
 

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:49.060
build a scalable quantum computer you
would have to keep it extremely well

00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:49.070
would have to keep it extremely well
 

00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:51.940
would have to keep it extremely well
isolated from the rest of the world but

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:51.950
isolated from the rest of the world but
 

00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:53.860
isolated from the rest of the world but
at the same time be able to go in and

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:53.870
at the same time be able to go in and
 

00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:56.260
at the same time be able to go in and
actually do the computation okay so it's

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:56.270
actually do the computation okay so it's
 

00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:58.660
actually do the computation okay so it's
those twin requirements that are sort of

00:34:58.660 --> 00:34:58.670
those twin requirements that are sort of
 

00:34:58.670 --> 00:35:00.880
those twin requirements that are sort of
the reason why we don't have scalable

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:00.890
the reason why we don't have scalable
 

00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:03.600
the reason why we don't have scalable
quantum computers yet okay the the

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:03.610
quantum computers yet okay the the
 

00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:09.040
quantum computers yet okay the the
what's been done after sort of a decade

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:09.050
what's been done after sort of a decade
 

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:11.170
what's been done after sort of a decade
of work and sort of more than a billion

00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:11.180
of work and sort of more than a billion
 

00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:14.080
of work and sort of more than a billion
dollars spent at yeah by research groups

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:14.090
dollars spent at yeah by research groups
 

00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:16.030
dollars spent at yeah by research groups
all over the world is that a quantum

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:16.040
all over the world is that a quantum
 

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:18.580
all over the world is that a quantum
computer has with high probability shown

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:18.590
computer has with high probability shown
 

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:20.770

that fifteen equals three times five

00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:20.780
that fifteen equals three times five
 

00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:25.540
that fifteen equals three times five
okay twenty-one might be next but but

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:25.550
okay twenty-one might be next but but
 

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:28.000
okay twenty-one might be next but but
you know scaling it up is extremely hard

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:28.010
you know scaling it up is extremely hard
 

00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:30.670
you know scaling it up is extremely hard
because of this decoherence problem okay

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:30.680
because of this decoherence problem okay
 

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:32.890
because of this decoherence problem okay
but on the other hand no one has been

00:35:32.890 --> 00:35:32.900
but on the other hand no one has been
 

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:35.650
but on the other hand no one has been
able to articulate any clear reason why

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:35.660
able to articulate any clear reason why
 

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:37.470
able to articulate any clear reason why
it should not be possible in principle

00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:37.480
it should not be possible in principle
 

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:40.210
it should not be possible in principle
okay some computer scientists will tell

00:35:40.210 --> 00:35:40.220
okay some computer scientists will tell
 

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:42.430
okay some computer scientists will tell
you that it must not be possible because

00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:42.440
you that it must not be possible because
 

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:44.470
you that it must not be possible because
if it were possible then you could you

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:44.480
if it were possible then you could you
 

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:46.360
if it were possible then you could you
know quickly factor huge numbers and

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:46.370
know quickly factor huge numbers and
 

00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:48.040
know quickly factor huge numbers and
solve these hard problems that's sort of

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:48.050
solve these hard problems that's sort of
 

00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:52.720
solve these hard problems that's sort of
a circular argument okay but you know so

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:52.730
a circular argument okay but you know so
 

00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:53.800
a circular argument okay but you know so
I think that we're really in the

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:53.810
I think that we're really in the

ok which is an amazing fact and you know

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:11.510
ok which is an amazing fact and you know
 

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:14.079
ok which is an amazing fact and you know
and it's a and it is very different from

00:38:14.079 --> 00:38:14.089
and it's a and it is very different from
 

00:38:14.089 --> 00:38:15.940
and it's a and it is very different from
anything in classical physics the

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:15.950
anything in classical physics the
 

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:17.650
anything in classical physics the
problem is that as soon as you

00:38:17.650 --> 00:38:17.660
problem is that as soon as you
 

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:18.970
problem is that as soon as you
measure the quantum computer or they

00:38:18.970 --> 00:38:18.980

said you only get out one outcome okay

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:21.200
said you only get out one outcome okay
 

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:24.010
said you only get out one outcome okay
and therefore you know uh so you could

00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:24.020
and therefore you know uh so you could
 

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:26.170
and therefore you know uh so you could
say look it's like you know I don't know

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:26.180
say look it's like you know I don't know
 

00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:27.880
say look it's like you know I don't know
what state the machine is in and then I

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:27.890
what state the machine is in and then I
 

00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:29.170
what state the machine is in and then I
look and then I do know

00:38:29.170 --> 00:38:29.180
look and then I do know
 

00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:31.510
look and then I do know
you know what's magic about that right

00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:31.520
you know what's magic about that right
 

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:34.180
you know what's magic about that right
so if there's any hope of getting a

00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:34.190
so if there's any hope of getting a
 

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:36.430
so if there's any hope of getting a
speed-up by this type of computer of

00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:36.440
speed-up by this type of computer of
 

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:38.170
speed-up by this type of computer of
doing something which a classical

00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:38.180
doing something which a classical
 

00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:40.750
doing something which a classical
computer cannot do then everything rests

00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:40.760
computer cannot do then everything rests
 

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:45.520
computer cannot do then everything rests
on one fact which is that amplitudes can

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:45.530
on one fact which is that amplitudes can
 

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:48.370
on one fact which is that amplitudes can
interfere with each other okay so you

00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:48.380
interfere with each other okay so you
 

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:52.299
interfere with each other okay so you
know you of all of the different sort of

00:38:52.299 --> 00:38:52.309
know you of all of the different sort of
 

00:38:52.309 --> 00:38:54.460
know you of all of the different sort of
paths that could lead to a given answer

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:54.470
paths that could lead to a given answer
 

00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:56.410
paths that could lead to a given answer
so you know some can have positive

00:38:56.410 --> 00:38:56.420
so you know some can have positive
 

00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:58.180
so you know some can have positive
amplitude others can have negative

00:38:58.180 --> 00:38:58.190
amplitude others can have negative
 

00:38:58.190 --> 00:39:00.700
amplitude others can have negative
amplitude if that's the case then those

00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:00.710
amplitude if that's the case then those
 

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:02.470
amplitude if that's the case then those
amplitudes will cancel each other out

00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:02.480
amplitudes will cancel each other out
 

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:04.809
amplitudes will cancel each other out
with the result being that that answer

00:39:04.809 --> 00:39:04.819
with the result being that that answer
 

00:39:04.819 --> 00:39:07.120
with the result being that that answer
will you know possibly not be observed

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:07.130

versus NP question so if we can't even
 

00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:08.710
versus NP question so if we can't even
prove that P doesn't contain NP then how

00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:08.720
prove that P doesn't contain NP then how
 

00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:10.750
prove that P doesn't contain NP then how
are how on earth are we going to prove

00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:10.760
are how on earth are we going to prove
 

00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:15.160
are how on earth are we going to prove
that bqp doesn't contain it okay so yeah

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:15.170
that bqp doesn't contain it okay so yeah
 

00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:16.480
that bqp doesn't contain it okay so yeah
so it's an open problem but on the other

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:16.490
so it's an open problem but on the other
 

00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:18.480
so it's an open problem but on the other
hand certainly no one knows how to use

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:18.490
hand certainly no one knows how to use
 

00:44:18.490 --> 00:44:20.470
hand certainly no one knows how to use

00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:20.480
quantum interference to solve
 

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:24.490
quantum interference to solve
np-complete problems okay and in fact we

00:44:24.490 --> 00:44:24.500
np-complete problems okay and in fact we
 

00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:26.230
np-complete problems okay and in fact we
have some evidence that it if it's

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:26.240
have some evidence that it if it's
 

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:27.640
have some evidence that it if it's
possible at all it's going to be

00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:27.650
possible at all it's going to be
 

00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:29.829
possible at all it's going to be
extremely hard particular there is a

Brassard and Vaz irani from 97 which

00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:35.570
Brassard and Vaz irani from 97 which
 

00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:37.930

00:44:44.089 --> 00:44:46.000
problems okay so what they showed is
that if you were to throw away the

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:46.010
that if you were to throw away the
 

00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:48.849
that if you were to throw away the
structure of an np-complete problem and

00:44:48.849 --> 00:44:48.859
structure of an np-complete problem and
 

00:44:48.859 --> 00:44:51.599

just envision it as you have this

00:44:51.599 --> 00:44:51.609
just envision it as you have this
 

00:44:51.609 --> 00:44:54.910
just envision it as you have this

know feed it to some to some machine

00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:08.220
know feed it to some to some machine
 

00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:10.910
know feed it to some to some machine
that tells you is it is is this a valid

00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:10.920
that tells you is it is is this a valid
 

00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:13.100
that tells you is it is is this a valid
solution or is it not one okay let's say

00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:13.110
solution or is it not one okay let's say
 

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:15.260

just one solution out of all these two

00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:15.270
just one solution out of all these two
 

00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:17.660
just one solution out of all these two
to the N is a valid one so you're

00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:17.670
to the N is a valid one so you're
 

00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:20.000
to the N is a valid one so you're
looking for a needle in an exponentially

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:20.010
looking for a needle in an exponentially
 

00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:24.620
looking for a needle in an exponentially
large haystack okay then what be BBV

00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:24.630
large haystack okay then what be BBV
 

00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:27.050
large haystack okay then what be BBV
showed is that you're going to have to

00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:27.060
showed is that you're going to have to
 

00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:30.590
showed is that you're going to have to
ask a lot of questions to that haystack

00:45:30.590 --> 00:45:30.600
ask a lot of questions to that haystack
 

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:32.960
ask a lot of questions to that haystack
okay you're gonna have to spend a lot of

00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:32.970
okay you're gonna have to spend a lot of
 

00:45:32.970 --> 00:45:35.210
okay you're gonna have to spend a lot of
time sifting through the haystack now

00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:35.220
time sifting through the haystack now
 

00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:36.860
time sifting through the haystack now
that's obvious if you're a classical

00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:36.870
that's obvious if you're a classical
 

00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:39.110
that's obvious if you're a classical
person right if you have if you've got a

00:45:39.110 --> 00:45:39.120
person right if you have if you've got a
 

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:41.240
person right if you have if you've got a
needle in a haystack of size two to the

00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:41.250
needle in a haystack of size two to the
 

00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:42.920
needle in a haystack of size two to the
end well I'm probably it's gonna take

00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:42.930
end well I'm probably it's gonna take
 

00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:44.600
end well I'm probably it's gonna take
exponential time you've just you know

00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:44.610
exponential time you've just you know
 

00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:47.810
exponential time you've just you know
that's a lot of hay okay but you know

00:45:47.810 --> 00:45:47.820
that's a lot of hay okay but you know
 

00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:49.310
that's a lot of hay okay but you know
what if you're a quantum computer and

00:45:49.310 --> 00:45:49.320
what if you're a quantum computer and
 

00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:51.620
what if you're a quantum computer and
you can ask questions about every

00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:51.630
you can ask questions about every
 

00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:53.780
you can ask questions about every
possible you know location in the

00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:53.790
possible you know location in the
 

00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:56.180
possible you know location in the
haystack in superposition and then do

00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:56.190
haystack in superposition and then do
 

00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:59.240
haystack in superposition and then do
some coherent quantum transformation on

00:45:59.240 --> 00:45:59.250
some coherent quantum transformation on
 

00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:00.950
some coherent quantum transformation on
that you know then could you somehow

00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:00.960
that you know then could you somehow
 

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:03.500
that you know then could you somehow
magically you know just converge on the

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:03.510
magically you know just converge on the
 

00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:05.960
magically you know just converge on the
needle in like one or two steps okay

00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:05.970
needle in like one or two steps okay
 

00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:07.100
needle in like one or two steps okay
what they show is that that's actually

00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:07.110
what they show is that that's actually
 

00:46:07.110 --> 00:46:09.560
what they show is that that's actually
not possible and that the best that you

00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:09.570
not possible and that the best that you
 

00:46:09.570 --> 00:46:13.400
not possible and that the best that you
can do in that kind of situation is do

00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:13.410
can do in that kind of situation is do
 

00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:16.460
can do in that kind of situation is do
you can you can find the needle using a

00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:16.470
you can you can find the needle using a
 

00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:19.010
you can you can find the needle using a
number of steps that scales only like

00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:19.020
number of steps that scales only like
 

00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:21.170
number of steps that scales only like
the square root of the number of pieces

00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:21.180
the square root of the number of pieces
 

00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:23.780
the square root of the number of pieces
of hay okay you can get a quadratic

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:23.790
of hay okay you can get a quadratic
 

00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:26.990
of hay okay you can get a quadratic
speed-up over what a classical computer

00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:27.000
speed-up over what a classical computer
 

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.140
speed-up over what a classical computer
could do so for example if there were

00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:30.150
could do so for example if there were
 

00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:32.510
could do so for example if there were
two to the ten thousand pieces of hairy

00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:32.520
two to the ten thousand pieces of hairy
 

00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:34.580
two to the ten thousand pieces of hairy
now you don't need two to the ten

00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:34.590
now you don't need two to the ten
 

00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:36.920
now you don't need two to the ten
thousand time you merely need two to the

00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:36.930
thousand time you merely need two to the
 

00:46:36.930 --> 00:46:42.620
thousand time you merely need two to the
five thousand time okay and okay so so

00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:42.630
five thousand time okay and okay so so
 

00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:44.450
five thousand time okay and okay so so
bbbb proved that that's the best

00:46:44.450 --> 00:46:44.460
bbbb proved that that's the best
 

00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:47.360
bbbb proved that that's the best
possible and then actually after that

00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:47.370
possible and then actually after that
 

00:46:47.370 --> 00:46:49.910
possible and then actually after that
olive grove ER showed that actually that

00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920
olive grove ER showed that actually that
 

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:51.830
olive grove ER showed that actually that
square root speed-up can be achieved

00:46:51.830 --> 00:46:51.840
square root speed-up can be achieved
 

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:55.310
square root speed-up can be achieved
okay so this this loop gives the second

00:46:55.310 --> 00:46:55.320
okay so this this loop gives the second
 

00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:57.080
okay so this this loop gives the second

00:47:15.690 --> 00:47:17.359
can hope for it's still impressive it's
still something amazing and cool but

00:47:17.359 --> 00:47:17.369
still something amazing and cool but
 

00:47:17.369 --> 00:47:19.099

00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:48.060
you would be solving an np-complete
problem in polynomial time okay but you

00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:48.070
problem in polynomial time okay but you
 

00:51:48.070 --> 00:51:49.740
problem in polynomial time okay but you
know the amazing thing about this is

00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:49.750
know the amazing thing about this is
 

00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:51.660
know the amazing thing about this is
that if you believe already that

00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:51.670
that if you believe already that
 

00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:53.970
that if you believe already that
np-complete problems are hard then you

00:51:53.970 --> 00:51:53.980
np-complete problems are hard then you
 

00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:55.590
np-complete problems are hard then you
could actually make a prediction about

00:51:55.590 --> 00:51:55.600
could actually make a prediction about
 

00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:57.630
could actually make a prediction about
the behavior of condensed matter

00:51:57.630 --> 00:51:57.640
the behavior of condensed matter
 

00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:59.790
the behavior of condensed matter
physical systems you could say that this

00:51:59.790 --> 00:51:59.800
physical systems you could say that this
 

00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:02.040
physical systems you could say that this
gap has to decrease exponentially in

00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:02.050
gap has to decrease exponentially in
 

00:52:02.050 --> 00:52:03.930
gap has to decrease exponentially in
fact some of us did say that we were

00:52:03.930 --> 00:52:03.940
fact some of us did say that we were
 

00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:05.430
fact some of us did say that we were
kind of going out on a limb because we

00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:05.440
kind of going out on a limb because we
 

00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:07.230
kind of going out on a limb because we
didn't know anything about physics okay

00:52:07.230 --> 00:52:07.240
didn't know anything about physics okay
 

00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:11.790
didn't know anything about physics okay
but we ended up being right so you know

00:52:11.790 --> 00:52:11.800
but we ended up being right so you know
 

00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:14.250
but we ended up being right so you know
and actually far he told me that he's

00:52:14.250 --> 00:52:14.260
and actually far he told me that he's
 

00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:16.680
and actually far he told me that he's
spoken to condensed matter experts and

00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:16.690
spoken to condensed matter experts and
 

00:52:16.690 --> 00:52:18.390
spoken to condensed matter experts and
said based on all of your experience

00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:18.400
said based on all of your experience
 

00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:20.640
said based on all of your experience
with these physical systems do you think

00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:20.650
with these physical systems do you think
 

00:52:20.650 --> 00:52:22.160
with these physical systems do you think
the spectral gap will decrease

00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:22.170
the spectral gap will decrease
 

00:52:22.170 --> 00:52:24.990
the spectral gap will decrease
polynomial e or exponentially as the

00:52:24.990 --> 00:52:25.000
polynomial e or exponentially as the
 

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.210
polynomial e or exponentially as the
size of the system is increased and he's

00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:27.220
size of the system is increased and he's
 

00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:29.670
size of the system is increased and he's
a expert or I forget the name some guru

00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:29.680
a expert or I forget the name some guru
 

00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:31.170
a expert or I forget the name some guru
in the field said I think it will

00:52:31.170 --> 00:52:31.180
in the field said I think it will
 

00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:33.360
in the field said I think it will
decrease exponentially and far he said

00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:33.370
decrease exponentially and far he said
 

00:52:33.370 --> 00:52:35.070
decrease exponentially and far he said
well why do you say that and the guy

00:52:35.070 --> 00:52:35.080
well why do you say that and the guy
 

00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:36.750
well why do you say that and the guy
said because otherwise your algorithm

00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:36.760
said because otherwise your algorithm
 

00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:39.190
said because otherwise your algorithm
would work

00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:39.200
 
 

00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:41.870
 
okay so this is an example of how you

00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:41.880
okay so this is an example of how you
 

00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:43.910
okay so this is an example of how you
can sort of you know if you if you

00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:43.920
can sort of you know if you if you
 

00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:46.700
can sort of you know if you if you
believe that you know these problems are

00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:46.710
believe that you know these problems are
 

00:52:46.710 --> 00:52:48.980
believe that you know these problems are
probably hard then you know you could

00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:48.990
probably hard then you know you could
 

00:52:48.990 --> 00:52:50.870
probably hard then you know you could
sort of turn that around and sort of say

00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:50.880
sort of turn that around and sort of say
 

00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:52.520
sort of turn that around and sort of say
what are the implications for physics

00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:52.530
what are the implications for physics
 

00:52:52.530 --> 00:52:54.770
what are the implications for physics
just like you know if you you already

00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:54.780
just like you know if you you already
 

00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:56.120
just like you know if you you already
believe that you can't communicate

00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:56.130
believe that you can't communicate
 

00:52:56.130 --> 00:52:58.309
believe that you can't communicate
faster than the speed of light then that

00:52:58.309 --> 00:52:58.319
faster than the speed of light then that
 

00:52:58.319 --> 00:53:00.380
faster than the speed of light then that
in turn implies other things about the

00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:00.390
in turn implies other things about the
 

00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:04.370
in turn implies other things about the
laws of physics okay all right so what

00:53:04.370 --> 00:53:04.380
laws of physics okay all right so what
 

00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:06.950
laws of physics okay all right so what
else could you do if you wanted to solve

00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960
else could you do if you wanted to solve
 

00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:08.660
else could you do if you wanted to solve
if you really really wanted to solve

00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:08.670
if you really really wanted to solve
 

00:53:08.670 --> 00:53:10.819
if you really really wanted to solve
these np-complete problems and you put

00:53:10.819 --> 00:53:10.829
these np-complete problems and you put
 

00:53:10.829 --> 00:53:13.490
these np-complete problems and you put
mathematicians out of business okay so

00:53:13.490 --> 00:53:13.500
mathematicians out of business okay so
 

00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:15.440
mathematicians out of business okay so
now I'm going to tell you about some

00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:15.450
now I'm going to tell you about some
 

00:53:15.450 --> 00:53:17.210
now I'm going to tell you about some
speculative changes to the laws of

00:53:17.210 --> 00:53:17.220
speculative changes to the laws of
 

00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:19.760
speculative changes to the laws of
physics that would enable np-complete

00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:19.770
physics that would enable np-complete
 

00:53:19.770 --> 00:53:21.620
physics that would enable np-complete

00:53:21.620 --> 00:53:21.630
problems to be solved this is the fun
 

00:53:21.630 --> 00:53:23.329
problems to be solved this is the fun
part of the talk okay

00:53:23.329 --> 00:53:23.339
part of the talk okay
 

00:53:23.339 --> 00:53:27.109
part of the talk okay
the the first example is so you look at

00:53:27.109 --> 00:53:27.119
the the first example is so you look at
 

00:53:27.119 --> 00:53:28.849
the the first example is so you look at
the Schrodinger equation which is the

00:53:28.849 --> 00:53:28.859
the Schrodinger equation which is the
 

00:53:28.859 --> 00:53:30.859
the Schrodinger equation which is the
governing equation of mass amount of

00:53:30.859 --> 00:53:30.869
governing equation of mass amount of
 

00:53:30.869 --> 00:53:36.650
governing equation of mass amount of
sorry of quantum mechanics and this you

00:53:36.650 --> 00:53:36.660
sorry of quantum mechanics and this you
 

00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:37.970
sorry of quantum mechanics and this you
know amazing thing about this equation

00:53:37.970 --> 00:53:37.980
know amazing thing about this equation
 

00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:40.039
know amazing thing about this equation
is that it's exactly linear it's a

00:53:40.039 --> 00:53:40.049
is that it's exactly linear it's a
 

00:53:40.049 --> 00:53:43.010
is that it's exactly linear it's a
linear differential equation okay but

00:53:43.010 --> 00:53:43.020
linear differential equation okay but
 

00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:45.200
linear differential equation okay but
people have speculated like Stephen

00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:45.210
people have speculated like Stephen
 

00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:47.000
people have speculated like Stephen
Weinberg and other physicists for a long

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:47.010
Weinberg and other physicists for a long
 

00:53:47.010 --> 00:53:49.069
Weinberg and other physicists for a long
time about what would happen if you

00:53:49.069 --> 00:53:49.079
time about what would happen if you
 

00:53:49.079 --> 00:53:52.490
time about what would happen if you
inserted tiny nonlinear terms into the

00:53:52.490 --> 00:53:52.500
inserted tiny nonlinear terms into the
 

00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:54.890
inserted tiny nonlinear terms into the
Schrodinger equation maybe too tiny to

00:53:54.890 --> 00:53:54.900
Schrodinger equation maybe too tiny to
 

00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:57.529
Schrodinger equation maybe too tiny to
have been detected yet okay and it was

00:53:57.529 --> 00:53:57.539
have been detected yet okay and it was
 

00:53:57.539 --> 00:53:59.029
have been detected yet okay and it was
realized that all kinds of crazy things

00:53:59.029 --> 00:53:59.039
realized that all kinds of crazy things
 

00:53:59.039 --> 00:54:00.859
realized that all kinds of crazy things
would happen for example you could then

00:54:00.859 --> 00:54:00.869
would happen for example you could then
 

00:54:00.869 --> 00:54:03.079
would happen for example you could then
communicate information faster than

00:54:03.079 --> 00:54:03.089
communicate information faster than
 

00:54:03.089 --> 00:54:09.890
communicate information faster than
light okay and but in 98 Abrams and

00:54:09.890 --> 00:54:09.900
light okay and but in 98 Abrams and
 

00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:11.809
light okay and but in 98 Abrams and
Lloyd pointed out that another crazy

00:54:11.809 --> 00:54:11.819
Lloyd pointed out that another crazy
 

00:54:11.819 --> 00:54:13.400
Lloyd pointed out that another crazy
thing that would happen in such a

00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:13.410
thing that would happen in such a
 

00:54:13.410 --> 00:54:16.370
thing that would happen in such a
scenario is that then quantum computers

00:54:16.370 --> 00:54:16.380
scenario is that then quantum computers
 

00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:17.870
scenario is that then quantum computers
really would be able to solve

00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:17.880
really would be able to solve
 

00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:20.029
really would be able to solve
np-complete problems in polynomial time

00:54:20.029 --> 00:54:20.039
np-complete problems in polynomial time
 

00:54:20.039 --> 00:54:22.609
np-complete problems in polynomial time
okay and I can explain how it works with

00:54:22.609 --> 00:54:22.619
okay and I can explain how it works with
 

00:54:22.619 --> 00:54:26.059
okay and I can explain how it works with
just a picture so it's very easy to

00:54:26.059 --> 00:54:26.069
just a picture so it's very easy to
 

00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:28.339
just a picture so it's very easy to
create a quantum state assay of one

00:54:28.339 --> 00:54:28.349
create a quantum state assay of one
 

00:54:28.349 --> 00:54:32.420
create a quantum state assay of one
quantum bit one qubit that will be in

00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:32.430
quantum bit one qubit that will be in
 

00:54:32.430 --> 00:54:34.760
quantum bit one qubit that will be in
some particular will be pointing in some

00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:34.770
some particular will be pointing in some
 

00:54:34.770 --> 00:54:36.859
some particular will be pointing in some
particular direction quantum state is

00:54:36.859 --> 00:54:36.869
particular direction quantum state is
 

00:54:36.869 --> 00:54:38.690
particular direction quantum state is
just a vector okay so let's say it'll be

00:54:38.690 --> 00:54:38.700
just a vector okay so let's say it'll be
 

00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:41.569
just a vector okay so let's say it'll be
pointing this way if there are no

00:54:41.569 --> 00:54:41.579
pointing this way if there are no
 

00:54:41.579 --> 00:54:43.760
pointing this way if there are no
solutions to some np-complete problem

00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:43.770
solutions to some np-complete problem
 

00:54:43.770 --> 00:54:45.589
solutions to some np-complete problem
and if there's one solution that are

00:54:45.589 --> 00:54:45.599
and if there's one solution that are
 

00:54:45.599 --> 00:54:47.750
and if there's one solution that are
between almost the same way but just

00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:47.760
between almost the same way but just
 

00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:51.970
between almost the same way but just
sort of exponentially a small amount up

00:54:51.970 --> 00:54:51.980
sort of exponentially a small amount up
 

00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:54.460
sort of exponentially a small amount up
okay so now of course the you know the

00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:54.470
okay so now of course the you know the
 

00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:55.839
okay so now of course the you know the
problem in conventional quantum

00:54:55.839 --> 00:54:55.849
problem in conventional quantum
 

00:54:55.849 --> 00:54:57.370
problem in conventional quantum
mechanics so yeah you can make these

00:54:57.370 --> 00:54:57.380
mechanics so yeah you can make these
 

00:54:57.380 --> 00:54:58.870
mechanics so yeah you can make these
states but if you wanted to actually

00:54:58.870 --> 00:54:58.880
states but if you wanted to actually
 

00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:00.940
states but if you wanted to actually
distinguish them from each other then

00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:00.950
distinguish them from each other then
 

00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:02.650
distinguish them from each other then
you would need to repeat the experiment

00:55:02.650 --> 00:55:02.660
you would need to repeat the experiment
 

00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:05.319
you would need to repeat the experiment
an exponential number of times okay

00:55:05.319 --> 00:55:05.329
an exponential number of times okay
 

00:55:05.329 --> 00:55:07.240
an exponential number of times okay
because these states are so close that

00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:07.250
because these states are so close that
 

00:55:07.250 --> 00:55:08.829
because these states are so close that
when you make a measurement you know

00:55:08.829 --> 00:55:08.839
when you make a measurement you know
 

00:55:08.839 --> 00:55:10.240
when you make a measurement you know
almost always you're gonna get the same

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:10.250
almost always you're gonna get the same
 

00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:12.819
almost always you're gonna get the same
answer okay you're only exponentially

00:55:12.819 --> 00:55:12.829
answer okay you're only exponentially
 

00:55:12.829 --> 00:55:14.440
answer okay you're only exponentially
unlikely to even see the difference

00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:14.450
unlikely to even see the difference
 

00:55:14.450 --> 00:55:16.210
unlikely to even see the difference
between these two okay so this doesn't

00:55:16.210 --> 00:55:16.220
between these two okay so this doesn't
 

00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:17.950
between these two okay so this doesn't
give you a practical way of solving

00:55:17.950 --> 00:55:17.960

np-complete problems quantum
 

00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:22.480
np-complete problems quantum
mechanically okay but Abrams and Lloyd

00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:22.490
mechanically okay but Abrams and Lloyd
 

00:55:22.490 --> 00:55:24.940
mechanically okay but Abrams and Lloyd
pointed out well what if the Schrodinger

00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:24.950
pointed out well what if the Schrodinger
 

00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:27.010
pointed out well what if the Schrodinger
equation were nonlinear okay in that

00:55:27.010 --> 00:55:27.020
equation were nonlinear okay in that
 

00:55:27.020 --> 00:55:29.470
equation were nonlinear okay in that
case there could be transformations on

00:55:29.470 --> 00:55:29.480
case there could be transformations on
 

00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:31.359
case there could be transformations on
states that would not have to preserve

00:55:31.359 --> 00:55:31.369
states that would not have to preserve
 

00:55:31.369 --> 00:55:34.240
states that would not have to preserve
the angle between pairs of states and so

00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:34.250
the angle between pairs of states and so
 

00:55:34.250 --> 00:55:35.500
the angle between pairs of states and so
what you could do is sort of have these

00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:35.510
what you could do is sort of have these
 

00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:37.030
what you could do is sort of have these
states and then just sort of gradually

00:55:37.030 --> 00:55:37.040
states and then just sort of gradually
 

00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:40.420
states and then just sort of gradually
pry them apart okay you could apply some

00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:40.430
pry them apart okay you could apply some
 

00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:42.520
pry them apart okay you could apply some
nonlinear transformation sort of very

00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:42.530
nonlinear transformation sort of very
 

00:55:42.530 --> 00:55:45.190
nonlinear transformation sort of very
generically that just sort of increases

00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:45.200
generically that just sort of increases
 

00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:46.920
generically that just sort of increases
the angle between them until they're

00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:46.930
the angle between them until they're
 

00:55:46.930 --> 00:55:49.839
the angle between them until they're
orthogonal or almost orthogonal in which

00:55:49.839 --> 00:55:49.849
orthogonal or almost orthogonal in which
 

00:55:49.849 --> 00:55:51.819
orthogonal or almost orthogonal in which
case they can be easily distinguished by

00:55:51.819 --> 00:55:51.829
case they can be easily distinguished by
 

00:55:51.829 --> 00:55:55.810
case they can be easily distinguished by
a measurement okay so you know now one

00:55:55.810 --> 00:55:55.820
a measurement okay so you know now one
 

00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:57.790
a measurement okay so you know now one
conclusion you could draw from this is

00:55:57.790 --> 00:55:57.800
conclusion you could draw from this is
 

00:55:57.800 --> 00:55:59.829
conclusion you could draw from this is
wow that's awesome we should go out and

00:55:59.829 --> 00:55:59.839
wow that's awesome we should go out and
 

00:55:59.839 --> 00:56:01.480
wow that's awesome we should go out and
look for these nonlinearities because

00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:01.490
look for these nonlinearities because
 

00:56:01.490 --> 00:56:03.790
look for these nonlinearities because
then we can solve np-complete problems

00:56:03.790 --> 00:56:03.800
then we can solve np-complete problems
 

00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:05.440
then we can solve np-complete problems
okay another conclusion you could draw

00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:05.450
okay another conclusion you could draw
 

00:56:05.450 --> 00:56:07.720
okay another conclusion you could draw
is maybe this is actually providing us

00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:07.730
is maybe this is actually providing us
 

00:56:07.730 --> 00:56:10.359
is maybe this is actually providing us
an additional explanation as to why the

00:56:10.359 --> 00:56:10.369
an additional explanation as to why the
 

00:56:10.369 --> 00:56:18.700
an additional explanation as to why the
Schrodinger equation is linear okay now

00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:18.710
Schrodinger equation is linear okay now
 

00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:20.380
Schrodinger equation is linear okay now
one of my personal favorites is the

00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:20.390
one of my personal favorites is the
 

00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:22.390
one of my personal favorites is the
relative quantum computers are not going

00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:22.400
relative quantum computers are not going
 

00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:24.460
relative quantum computers are not going
to do it then how about the relativity

00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:24.470
to do it then how about the relativity
 

00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:25.120
to do it then how about the relativity
computer

00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:25.130
computer
 

00:56:25.130 --> 00:56:27.430
computer
okay now the idea here is an extremely

00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:27.440
okay now the idea here is an extremely
 

00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:29.440
okay now the idea here is an extremely
simple one you would start your computer

00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:29.450
simple one you would start your computer
 

00:56:29.450 --> 00:56:32.170
simple one you would start your computer
working on some incredibly hard problem

00:56:32.170 --> 00:56:32.180
working on some incredibly hard problem
 

00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:34.180
working on some incredibly hard problem
doesn't even have to be an NP problem

00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:34.190
doesn't even have to be an NP problem
 

00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:36.280
doesn't even have to be an NP problem
you know some really hard calculation

00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:36.290
you know some really hard calculation
 

00:56:36.290 --> 00:56:38.050
you know some really hard calculation
then you leave your computer on earth

00:56:38.050 --> 00:56:38.060
then you leave your computer on earth
 

00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:40.930
then you leave your computer on earth
okay then you board a spaceship which is

00:56:40.930 --> 00:56:40.940
okay then you board a spaceship which is
 

00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:42.760
okay then you board a spaceship which is
traveling it very close to the speed of

00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:42.770
traveling it very close to the speed of
 

00:56:42.770 --> 00:56:45.550
traveling it very close to the speed of
light okay then you you get you come

00:56:45.550 --> 00:56:45.560
light okay then you you get you come
 

00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:48.010
light okay then you you get you come
back to earth now billions of years have

00:56:48.010 --> 00:56:48.020
back to earth now billions of years have
 

00:56:48.020 --> 00:56:50.829
back to earth now billions of years have
passed in earth time all of your friends

00:56:50.829 --> 00:56:50.839
passed in earth time all of your friends
 

00:56:50.839 --> 00:56:52.839
passed in earth time all of your friends
are long dead civilization has collapsed

00:56:52.839 --> 00:56:52.849
are long dead civilization has collapsed
 

00:56:52.849 --> 00:56:54.849
are long dead civilization has collapsed
but you've got the answer to your

00:56:54.849 --> 00:56:54.859
but you've got the answer to your
 

00:56:54.859 --> 00:56:59.140
but you've got the answer to your
np-complete problem okay so what's the

00:56:59.140 --> 00:56:59.150
np-complete problem okay so what's the
 

00:56:59.150 --> 00:57:00.760
np-complete problem okay so what's the
problem with this you know why why don't

00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:00.770
problem with this you know why why don't
 

00:57:00.770 --> 00:57:03.440
problem with this you know why why don't
people try it right so

00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:03.450
people try it right so
 

00:57:03.450 --> 00:57:05.640
people try it right so
all right well I think there's actually

00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:05.650
all right well I think there's actually
 

00:57:05.650 --> 00:57:07.799
all right well I think there's actually
something to say about this cuz you know

00:57:07.799 --> 00:57:07.809
something to say about this cuz you know
 

00:57:07.809 --> 00:57:09.239
something to say about this cuz you know
you can say all right that sounds kind

00:57:09.239 --> 00:57:09.249
you can say all right that sounds kind
 

00:57:09.249 --> 00:57:11.549
you can say all right that sounds kind
of silly but no seriously why doesn't it

00:57:11.549 --> 00:57:11.559
of silly but no seriously why doesn't it
 

00:57:11.559 --> 00:57:13.440
of silly but no seriously why doesn't it
work what goes wrong right and actually

00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:13.450
work what goes wrong right and actually
 

00:57:13.450 --> 00:57:15.390
work what goes wrong right and actually
if you think about it enough I think

00:57:15.390 --> 00:57:15.400
if you think about it enough I think
 

00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:17.789
if you think about it enough I think
that the the answer to that question has

00:57:17.789 --> 00:57:17.799
that the the answer to that question has
 

00:57:17.799 --> 00:57:20.370
that the the answer to that question has
to do with the amount of energy that you

00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:20.380
to do with the amount of energy that you
 

00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:22.489
to do with the amount of energy that you
would need in order to accelerate

00:57:22.489 --> 00:57:22.499
would need in order to accelerate
 

00:57:22.499 --> 00:57:24.569
would need in order to accelerate
sufficiently close to the speed of light

00:57:24.569 --> 00:57:24.579
sufficiently close to the speed of light
 

00:57:24.579 --> 00:57:27.150
sufficiently close to the speed of light
okay what you can show is that to get an

00:57:27.150 --> 00:57:27.160
okay what you can show is that to get an
 

00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:29.009
okay what you can show is that to get an
exponential speed-up you would actually

00:57:29.009 --> 00:57:29.019
exponential speed-up you would actually
 

00:57:29.019 --> 00:57:31.650
exponential speed-up you would actually
have to accelerate you know so much that

00:57:31.650 --> 00:57:31.660
have to accelerate you know so much that
 

00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:34.170
have to accelerate you know so much that
the the there would be only an

00:57:34.170 --> 00:57:34.180
the the there would be only an
 

00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:36.210
the the there would be only an
exponentially small difference between

00:57:36.210 --> 00:57:36.220
exponentially small difference between
 

00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:38.789
exponentially small difference between
your speed and that of light okay to do

00:57:38.789 --> 00:57:38.799
your speed and that of light okay to do
 

00:57:38.799 --> 00:57:41.400
your speed and that of light okay to do
that requires an exponential amount of

00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:41.410
that requires an exponential amount of
 

00:57:41.410 --> 00:57:44.099
that requires an exponential amount of
energy which then implies that your fuel

00:57:44.099 --> 00:57:44.109
energy which then implies that your fuel
 

00:57:44.109 --> 00:57:46.170
energy which then implies that your fuel
tank or whatever is powering your

00:57:46.170 --> 00:57:46.180
tank or whatever is powering your
 

00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:47.880
tank or whatever is powering your
spaceship it probably ought to be

00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:47.890
spaceship it probably ought to be
 

00:57:47.890 --> 00:57:50.370
spaceship it probably ought to be
exponentially large okay so then you're

00:57:50.370 --> 00:57:50.380
exponentially large okay so then you're
 

00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:52.410
exponentially large okay so then you're
again needing to spend exponential time

00:57:52.410 --> 00:57:52.420
again needing to spend exponential time
 

00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:55.469
again needing to spend exponential time
you know just to build the tank right or

00:57:55.469 --> 00:57:55.479
you know just to build the tank right or
 

00:57:55.479 --> 00:57:57.900
you know just to build the tank right or
for the fuel from the far part of the

00:57:57.900 --> 00:57:57.910
for the fuel from the far part of the
 

00:57:57.910 --> 00:58:00.870
for the fuel from the far part of the
tank to affect you okay and so you know

00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:00.880
tank to affect you okay and so you know
 

00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:02.999
tank to affect you okay and so you know
again you're you know it's needing

00:58:02.999 --> 00:58:03.009
again you're you know it's needing
 

00:58:03.009 --> 00:58:04.289
again you're you know it's needing
exponential time but just for a

00:58:04.289 --> 00:58:04.299
exponential time but just for a
 

00:58:04.299 --> 00:58:05.759
exponential time but just for a
different reason okay this is a good

00:58:05.759 --> 00:58:05.769
different reason okay this is a good
 

00:58:05.769 --> 00:58:08.549
different reason okay this is a good
example of how when you look at only one

00:58:08.549 --> 00:58:08.559
example of how when you look at only one
 

00:58:08.559 --> 00:58:10.170
example of how when you look at only one
or two things about the laws of physics

00:58:10.170 --> 00:58:10.180
or two things about the laws of physics
 

00:58:10.180 --> 00:58:11.880
or two things about the laws of physics
it can look like you have some hyper

00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:11.890
it can look like you have some hyper
 

00:58:11.890 --> 00:58:14.489
it can look like you have some hyper
computing power so amazing computational

00:58:14.489 --> 00:58:14.499
computing power so amazing computational
 

00:58:14.499 --> 00:58:15.839
computing power so amazing computational
power but then when you take everything

00:58:15.839 --> 00:58:15.849
power but then when you take everything
 

00:58:15.849 --> 00:58:18.890
power but then when you take everything
into account it always seems to go away

00:58:18.890 --> 00:58:18.900
into account it always seems to go away
 

00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:21.900
into account it always seems to go away
okay another of my favorites is what I

00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:21.910
okay another of my favorites is what I
 

00:58:21.910 --> 00:58:24.180
okay another of my favorites is what I
call the Z no computer this is also a

00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:24.190
call the Z no computer this is also a
 

00:58:24.190 --> 00:58:26.489
call the Z no computer this is also a
very simple idea okay you would do the

00:58:26.489 --> 00:58:26.499
very simple idea okay you would do the
 

00:58:26.499 --> 00:58:28.769
very simple idea okay you would do the
first step of your computation in one

00:58:28.769 --> 00:58:28.779
first step of your computation in one
 

00:58:28.779 --> 00:58:31.109
first step of your computation in one
second you do the second step in half a

00:58:31.109 --> 00:58:31.119
second you do the second step in half a
 

00:58:31.119 --> 00:58:33.059
second you do the second step in half a
second you do the third step in a

00:58:33.059 --> 00:58:33.069
second you do the third step in a
 

00:58:33.069 --> 00:58:35.039
second you do the third step in a
quarter second the fourth step in an

00:58:35.039 --> 00:58:35.049
quarter second the fourth step in an
 

00:58:35.049 --> 00:58:37.769
quarter second the fourth step in an
eighth second and so on so that after

00:58:37.769 --> 00:58:37.779
eighth second and so on so that after
 

00:58:37.779 --> 00:58:39.299
eighth second and so on so that after
two seconds you would have done

00:58:39.299 --> 00:58:39.309
two seconds you would have done
 

00:58:39.309 --> 00:58:42.900
two seconds you would have done
infinitely many steps okay you know

00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:42.910
infinitely many steps okay you know
 

00:58:42.910 --> 00:58:44.459
infinitely many steps okay you know
again why don't people try it

00:58:44.459 --> 00:58:44.469
again why don't people try it
 

00:58:44.469 --> 00:58:46.559
again why don't people try it
okay well the answer to that question is

00:58:46.559 --> 00:58:46.569
okay well the answer to that question is
 

00:58:46.569 --> 00:58:49.109
okay well the answer to that question is
people actually do try it they would do

00:58:49.109 --> 00:58:49.119
people actually do try it they would do
 

00:58:49.119 --> 00:58:50.999
people actually do try it they would do
what's called overclocking of their

00:58:50.999 --> 00:58:51.009
what's called overclocking of their
 

00:58:51.009 --> 00:58:53.609
what's called overclocking of their
microprocessors okay where you run your

00:58:53.609 --> 00:58:53.619
microprocessors okay where you run your
 

00:58:53.619 --> 00:58:55.650

problem when you do that well the

00:58:59.339 --> 00:58:59.349
problem when you do that well the
 

00:58:59.349 --> 00:59:01.589
problem when you do that well the
problem is if you overclock your chip

00:59:01.589 --> 00:59:01.599
problem is if you overclock your chip
 

00:59:01.599 --> 00:59:05.009
problem is if you overclock your chip
too fast it may melt okay it may

too fast it may melt okay it may
 

00:59:05.019 --> 00:59:07.499
too fast it may melt okay it may
actually overheat and you know and then

seem to come into play and prevent you
 

01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:45.490
seem to come into play and prevent you
from doing it okay

01:00:45.490 --> 01:00:45.500
from doing it okay
 

01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:48.190
from doing it okay
also maybe it won't shock you that if

01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:48.200
also maybe it won't shock you that if
 

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:50.230

encoded a valid solution to say your
 

01:01:02.809 --> 01:01:05.260
encoded a valid solution to say your
np-complete problem then you output X

01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:05.270
np-complete problem then you output X
 

01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:07.630
np-complete problem then you output X
again otherwise you output the next

01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:07.640
again otherwise you output the next
 

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:10.059
again otherwise you output the next
solution say X plus 1 mod 2 to the N

01:01:10.059 --> 01:01:10.069
solution say X plus 1 mod 2 to the N
 

01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:12.599
solution say X plus 1 mod 2 to the N
okay and now we say what are the

01:01:12.599 --> 01:01:12.609
okay and now we say what are the
 

01:01:12.609 --> 01:01:15.370
okay and now we say what are the

this is because photons are bosons one

01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:33.170
this is because photons are bosons one
 

01:04:33.170 --> 01:04:35.049
this is because photons are bosons one

01:04:39.289 --> 01:04:40.989
very weird statistical properties okay
in particular you've got a sum so

01:04:40.989 --> 01:04:40.999
in particular you've got a sum so
 

01:04:40.999 --> 01:04:43.029
in particular you've got a sum so
because these are an identical particles

01:04:43.029 --> 01:04:43.039
because these are an identical particles
 

01:04:43.039 --> 01:04:45.309
because these are an identical particles
right there are n factorial ways that

01:04:45.309 --> 01:04:45.319
right there are n factorial ways that
 

01:04:45.319 --> 01:04:46.660
right there are n factorial ways that
you could rearrange them among

01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:46.670
you could rearrange them among
 

01:04:46.670 --> 01:04:48.489
you could rearrange them among
themselves okay each of those ways

01:04:48.489 --> 01:04:48.499
themselves okay each of those ways
 

01:04:48.499 --> 01:04:50.650
themselves okay each of those ways
contribute some amplitude to the total

01:04:50.650 --> 01:04:50.660
contribute some amplitude to the total
 

01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:52.689
contribute some amplitude to the total
which is then a product of individual

01:04:52.689 --> 01:04:52.699
which is then a product of individual
 

01:04:52.699 --> 01:04:54.880
which is then a product of individual
amplitudes and so you get a function of

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:54.890
amplitudes and so you get a function of
 

01:04:54.890 --> 01:04:57.160
amplitudes and so you get a function of
an N by n matrix which is called the

01:06:06.109 --> 01:06:06.119
which are easier than these okay so so I
 

01:06:06.119 --> 01:06:07.670
which are easier than these okay so so I
think that there's a resolution of the

01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:07.680
think that there's a resolution of the
 

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:09.980
think that there's a resolution of the
paradox which is instructive okay and

01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:09.990
paradox which is instructive okay and
 

01:06:09.990 --> 01:06:12.980
paradox which is instructive okay and
the resolution is that amplitudes in

01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:12.990
the resolution is that amplitudes in
 

01:06:12.990 --> 01:06:14.870
the resolution is that amplitudes in
quantum mechanics are not directly

01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880
quantum mechanics are not directly
 

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:17.330
quantum mechanics are not directly
observable okay as I said before an

01:06:17.330 --> 01:06:17.340
observable okay as I said before an
 

01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:20.090
observable okay as I said before an
amplitude determines the probability

01:06:20.090 --> 01:06:20.100
amplitude determines the probability
 

01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:22.099
amplitude determines the probability
that you're going to see some particular

01:06:22.099 --> 01:06:22.109
that you're going to see some particular
 

01:06:22.109 --> 01:06:24.650
that you're going to see some particular
outcome okay but if an amplitude is

01:06:24.650 --> 01:06:24.660
outcome okay but if an amplitude is
 

01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:27.080
outcome okay but if an amplitude is
exponentially small then in order to get

01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:27.090
exponentially small then in order to get
 

01:06:27.090 --> 01:06:29.180
exponentially small then in order to get
a good estimate of the amplitude you may

01:06:29.180 --> 01:06:29.190
a good estimate of the amplitude you may
 

01:06:29.190 --> 01:06:30.980
a good estimate of the amplitude you may
need to repeat your experiment an

01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:30.990
need to repeat your experiment an
 

01:06:30.990 --> 01:06:33.590
need to repeat your experiment an
exponential number of times okay and

01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:33.600
exponential number of times okay and
 

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:35.359
exponential number of times okay and
that's really what's going on here right

01:06:35.359 --> 01:06:35.369
that's really what's going on here right
 

01:06:35.369 --> 01:06:37.760
that's really what's going on here right
so I think that we should you know we

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:37.770
so I think that we should you know we
 

01:06:37.770 --> 01:06:39.710
so I think that we should you know we
have to say that if you know there are

01:06:39.710 --> 01:06:39.720
have to say that if you know there are
 

01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:41.450
have to say that if you know there are
many systems in nature that may seem

01:06:41.450 --> 01:06:41.460
many systems in nature that may seem
 

01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:44.359
many systems in nature that may seem
like they somehow encode the solution to

01:06:44.359 --> 01:06:44.369
like they somehow encode the solution to
 

01:06:44.369 --> 01:06:46.490
like they somehow encode the solution to
some np-complete or even harder problem

01:06:46.490 --> 01:06:46.500
some np-complete or even harder problem
 

01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:49.520
some np-complete or even harder problem
but if you can't actually get the answer

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:49.530
but if you can't actually get the answer
 

01:06:49.530 --> 01:06:51.950
but if you can't actually get the answer
out by some actual physical measurement

01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:51.960
out by some actual physical measurement
 

01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:54.109
out by some actual physical measurement
it you know that you one could make in

01:06:54.109 --> 01:06:54.119
it you know that you one could make in
 

01:06:54.119 --> 01:06:56.210
it you know that you one could make in
principle at least then it doesn't count

01:06:56.210 --> 01:06:56.220
principle at least then it doesn't count
 

01:06:56.220 --> 01:07:01.070
principle at least then it doesn't count
okay it doesn't count so you know so

01:07:01.070 --> 01:07:01.080
okay it doesn't count so you know so
 

01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:03.050
okay it doesn't count so you know so
it's a good lesson now recently my

kind of linear optical setup and we gave

01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:08.250
kind of linear optical setup and we gave
 

01:07:08.250 --> 01:07:10.880
kind of linear optical setup and we gave
evidence that that actually it does do

01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:10.890
evidence that that actually it does do
 

01:07:10.890 --> 01:07:12.770

something which is you know even the

something which is you know even the
 

01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:14.900
something which is you know even the

observable outcomes in this experiment
 

01:07:14.910 --> 01:07:17.120

so I mentioned a few but I think it
 

01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:41.280
so I mentioned a few but I think it
would be it would be fascinating to try

would be it would be fascinating to try
 

01:09:41.290 --> 01:09:43.020
would be it would be fascinating to try
to take that further okay so thank you

01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:43.030
to take that further okay so thank you
 

01:09:43.030 --> 01:09:50.929
to take that further okay so thank you
for your attention
