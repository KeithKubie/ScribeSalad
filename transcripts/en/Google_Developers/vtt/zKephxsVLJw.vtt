ROBERT NYMAN:
[SPEAKING MANDARIN]

00:00:38.551 --> 00:00:41.870
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.350
[SPEAKING MANDARIN]

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.640
That's as much as I can do.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.930
It took a long time.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.750
It might be better next time.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.440
So I've come all
the way from Sweden.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.050
Unfortunately not
a direct flight,

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.030
but Google Maps is a bit
optimistic sometimes.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.900
And usually when I tell people
that I come from Sweden,

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.100
they asked me about Ikea.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.930
And if you know Ikea, we want
to say, on behalf of my people,

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:23.890
we're sorry.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.540
We are working on it.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.700
It will get better.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.750
And also one interesting
thing to know about Swedes is

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.900
that we very shy.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.970
So we have a lot of
feelings on the inside.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.110
But we don't really show
them on the outside.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.510
So I'm going to be
really excited up here.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.810
But you won't be able to see it.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.740
And I've been working on
the web for a long time.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.810
I started back in
the end of the 1990s.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.300
And then about eight
or 10 years later,

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.460
I got involved in the
Mozilla community,

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.220
building Firefox extensions and
giving presentations and such.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.300
And then I worked for
Mozilla almost four years

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.690
as a technical
evangelist around the web

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.630
and trying to teach people
how to build good websites.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.685
But everyone has a past.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.020
This is actually a young me.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.430
I'm not really sure
what was going on.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.690
I know it looks like
a Russian dating site.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.070
So don't ask any
questions, please.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.110
However despite this,
I actually have a job.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.190
And I work at Google
with developer feedback

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.190
and with communities.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.200
As part of that, I've
been fortunate enough

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.060
to get the opportunity
to travel around

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.100
to a number of
different countries

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.190
and to meet developers
and to try and understand

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.530
different challenges
and different contexts

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.410
and how we can try and
make things better for you

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.040
and also make sure that you have
the right help and tutorials

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.760
and guides.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.550
With the web as of today, I want
to start with mentioning that,

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.580
because the talk has the
title The Future of the Web.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.930
But I want to talk about
the web as of today first.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.510
And if we go back
about six years ago,

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.580
there's something
called Wired magazine.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.440
And they declared the web
dead about six years ago.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.140
And this is kind of tiring,
because it becomes always

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.980
this media thing that
something is dying.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.530
And it's a big crisis.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.250
Then of course, interestingly
enough, about six years later

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.990
they had a new editor
at the magazine.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.350
And suddenly the
web was alive again.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.870
And you hear these
things all the time.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.820
And if we look only from our
side with Chrome, for instance,

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:02.700
a year ago Chrome on mobile
alone had 800 million users.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:08.250
About six months ago, Chrome on
mobile reached 1 billion users.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.740
And now Chrome on
mobile and on desktop

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.680
together 2 billion users.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.010
And that's only one browser out
of many, many different ones.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.120
So the web is dead?

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.370
Well, not really.

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.070
We don't worry too much
about the headlines.

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.180
And we keep on building.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.450
And we have more and more people
using the web and building

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.240
things for the web.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.270
And I think the bad reputation,
especially with the mobile web,

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.190
is that this is what
the experience has

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.410
been like on the mobile
web for a long time.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.940
You would go into a website.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.829
You would get a big pop up
telling you to install an app.

00:04:42.829 --> 00:04:44.370
You've never seen
the website before.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.800
You don't even know if you
want their native app or not.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.370
But this was the
general experience.

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.520
But it's been
changing over time.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.510
And if we look now
that on average,

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.870
most smartphone users doesn't
install any new apps any month.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.890
So if you're one of the top
few apps, WeChat, for instance,

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.640
and a few other ones,
you're really popular.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.780
You have a lot of users.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.980
But most other apps
never get those users,

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.770
never gets that engagement.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.470
And we think, also,
the strength of the web

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.610
is that it's not just
one company or one

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.620
specific platform.

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.870
The web is a myriad
of different browsers.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.840
There's so many different
browsers on desktop

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.870
and on mobile out there.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.210
And what I will talk
about a bit today

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.430
is both learnings that we've had
about the web and also things

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.520
that we have
implemented in Chrome

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.540
and that we're starting
to implement Chrome.

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.360
Not just to talk about
Chrome, but also things

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.290
that we would love to see
standardized and things that we

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:52.220
would love to see in
any browser out there.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.980
And also when I talk
about the web as today,

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.490
it's generally
progressive web apps.

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.290
Progressive web apps is the
entire thing, the entire way

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.100
of making sure that we
build really good websites

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.030
and then also adding on even
more greater capabilities

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.190
that we've seen from
the native world.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:14.280
And I'm going to go through
six of them really quickly.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.180
And the first one, when we
talk about progress web apps,

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.130
we want to see instant loading.

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.020
Using something
like Service Workers

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.290
to make sure that you
have offline access,

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:26.630
but even more importantly
in places where

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.920
you have poor connectivity
or intermittent connectivity,

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.210
to make sure that you can have
a faster loading experience.

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.910
The next one is
adding to home screen.

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.360
As we see with users, having
an icon on the home screen

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.280
leads to great re-engagement.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.310
And people just keep
on using the app.

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.300
The third one is
push notification.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.600
And that was covered in
Sam's presentation before.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.240
But just seeing
re-engagement from users,

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.697
and notifications
can be terrible.

00:06:57.697 --> 00:06:59.030
And they can be really annoying.

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.580
But if you do them well, they
can be really, really good

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.770
and useful for your app as well.

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:10.172
The fourth one is making sure
that your web app is fast.

00:07:10.172 --> 00:07:12.380
And it's not only about
loading fast, but making sure

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:16.280
that the animations you have in
the web app is fast and smooth.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.580
And when you scroll
or if you move around,

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:22.600
it's a nice, good experience.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.210
Also that it's secure.

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:29.260
Basically for more or less
any of the new APIs coming out

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.170
right now, you have HTTPS.

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:33.550
That's one of the requirements.

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:35.830
And we're also
implementing HTTPS

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.410
for older APIs
like geo location,

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:41.950
because we see this as a
really necessary thing.

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.470
And we're also experimenting
with some things

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:47.800
in Chrome, because
before, if would access

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.925
a website over an
unsecure connection, HTTP,

00:07:51.925 --> 00:07:53.050
you would just see the URL.

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:54.730
And then we started
experimenting

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:58.996
with writing in the URL
bar that it's not secure.

00:07:58.996 --> 00:08:00.370
And then over
time, it might look

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:02.590
like something at the
bottom that we will actually

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:06.040
really start warning users
that any website that you have

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.380
an interaction with
has to be secure,

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:14.110
both for that website's sake but
also for your sake as a user.

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:17.050
The final one, of course,
is making it responsive.

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:19.942
If you build a mobile
web app, mobile website,

00:08:19.942 --> 00:08:21.400
you want to make
sure that it works

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:25.840
on any kind of resolutions
from different mobile devices,

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.760
to tablets, to desktops.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:32.090
So in a summary,
progressive web apps

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:37.370
today need to be reliable,
fast, engaging, and secure.

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:39.919
And the core of all
this is making sure

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:44.144
that your users have
a good experience.

00:08:44.144 --> 00:08:47.310
Experiences that are good
will have users coming back.

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:49.590
And happy users will
lead to happy developers

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:52.420
and happy companies.

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.270
And if you look back
only a few years,

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:57.180
we've come a really long
way on the web and things

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.030
that are being supported now.

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:02.310
We had to implement a
number of different APIs

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:04.440
and support a number
of different things.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.322
And more or less, one
of the only things

00:09:06.322 --> 00:09:08.280
that you can't do on the
web right now that you

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:13.300
can do native is having contact
access on your mobile phones.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:17.640
So I really want you to remember
that the web is already all

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.900
mighty powerful.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:23.850
I really hope that that is what
the Chinese characters means.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:26.350
I should have translated this.

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:29.434
But at the same time,
it's just the beginning.

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:37.140
All those things that
we've done so far,

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.800
you see notifications at the
home screen and all of that,

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.060
it's just making sure that
we can match the experience

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:46.530
that native has both
offered users, but also

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:48.720
the expectations that are
set with users that this

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.920
is what users want.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.990
And we should
bring that to them.

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:57.832
So finally, 32 slides later,
what about the future?

00:09:57.832 --> 00:09:59.540
What are the new things
that we're doing?

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.160
And when I refer
to the future, I

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.510
can talk about very
many crazy things.

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:09.030
But I'm not going to talk
about building robots

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:12.630
from old mobile phones and then
controlling them or something.

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:15.150
When I talk about the future,
and what I think is important

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:19.680
is something that you
can use now or very soon,

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.210
something that's
actually coming.

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:23.269
I don't want to say that
maybe in five years,

00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:24.060
you will have this.

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:27.420
I want it to be
relevant for you now.

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:30.360
So the things I'll be
talking about today

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:34.650
is knowing who the user
is, credentials management,

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:38.070
paying for things on the web,
connecting with hardware,

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:41.950
physical web, and web VR.

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:45.020
And first, with knowing
who the user is.

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:49.290
It's all about the challenges
on the mobile web with sign in.

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:51.300
And usually if you come
to a mobile website,

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.591
then you're supposed to log in.

00:10:52.591 --> 00:10:54.270
And you see all of this.

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:56.220
And it's seldom a
good experience,

00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:00.100
because when you see this,
you start thinking about this.

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:04.110
Did I use Facebook or Google or
any other account to sign up?

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:06.900
Usually you know
your email address.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.730
You will never remember
the password you

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:10.830
use for this specific website.

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:12.540
So you sit there and
you're wondering,

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:13.830
and you go through the page.

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:17.690
And then you find the magical
link, the forgot password link.

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:22.410
Has anyone not used
forgot password?

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:24.320
Good, we're among friends.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:27.000
It's OK.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.200
And also a really hard
part is on mobile keywords,

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.300
it's really hard to type.

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.050
You have a small keyboard.

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:37.410
And getting the right
characters in the right order,

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:42.310
and you're supposed to be
fast, isn't always easy,

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:43.920
which leads to a problem.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.130
Do you know what this is?

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:48.640
Yes, password.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:55.100
This is the most popular
password in 2015.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:59.150
Interestingly
enough, it actually

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:01.520
bumped down to second
most popular password,

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.140
which had been the most
popular for many years,

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.430
which was actually
the word password.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.480
So it's fun.

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:17.050
But it also poses an
enormous security risk.

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:20.040
And especially because everyone
is reusing their password

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.980
across websites and all of
that, and if one password or one

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:27.670
service leaks their passwords,
there's nothing you can do.

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:30.030
So one thing that we started
doing from the Chrome side

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:32.071
and trying to see if we
can help from the browser

00:12:32.071 --> 00:12:34.770
is introducing something
called Smart Lock.

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:38.390
And now with Smart Lock, we
have about 8 billion sign ins

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:42.210
that we assist through
Chrome every month.

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:46.050
And basically either
this just works for you.

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:47.640
Or as a developer,
you might need

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:51.720
to do really, really small
things in your website,

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.970
because generally when a
browser comes to your website

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:56.910
and reads out the forms, it
sees all the different fields.

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:58.590
And sometimes they're
really obvious.

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:01.500
And the browser will know
what to do and what to store.

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.980
But sometimes it
isn't entirely clear.

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:07.350
So something that you can use
is the autocomplete attribute.

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:09.980
So you can help the
browser understand

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.320
what each field actually means.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.830
So OK, this is the name.

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:15.120
This is the telephone number.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.100
This is the username, et cetera.

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:21.280
And if you have a sign
in form, for instance,

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.320
you can use autocomplete
and just specify

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.745
that this is the username.

00:13:24.745 --> 00:13:26.120
And this is the
current password.

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:32.560
And for sign up forms, when
you're creating a new account

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:33.890
you can have the same things.

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:36.230
But one interesting
part here is you

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:39.340
can see that we have
autocomplete new password

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:42.610
instead of current
password or just password.

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:45.260
And there are two
important reasons for that.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.130
One is if you have
Autofill in your browser,

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:50.710
just making sure that when you
create a new account that it

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:53.160
doesn't reduce what
you already have stored

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.060
or something like that.

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.160
But a second one, which
is really interesting,

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.190
is that if we, from
the browser side,

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:02.740
knows that the user
needs a new password,

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:06.440
we can auto generate
it from the browser.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:11.770
So for users, instead of them
having passwords like this,

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:14.120
we can give them
this as a password,

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.970
I mean not specifically
this, because that

00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:18.610
wouldn't be very secure,
because you've seen this now.

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:21.970
But more secure
passwords for them that

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:25.360
might not be easy to remember,
but it will make them safer

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.440
on the web.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.280
And we're
experimenting with auto

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:32.350
entering passwords in Chrome and
then deploying it more and more

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:33.160
widely.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.830
So please make sure to
mark up your forms today

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:37.810
with the autocomplete
attribute, because it's

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:40.240
a really small task to do.

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.610
But it means a lot for the
browser and for the users

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:44.720
as well.

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.970
Then we have the
credentials management API,

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:50.446
which is the next generation
for sign-in on the web.

00:14:50.446 --> 00:14:52.070
And we shipped this
recently in Chrome.

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.650
It's not in all browsers yet.

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:56.300
And it allows you,
as a developer,

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.960
to integrate with the
browsers Credential Manager.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.830
And for instance,
with Ali Express,

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:12.950
they have a really good example
of a good user sign in flow.

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:15.100
Being a shopping app,
it's really important

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:15.790
to be signed in.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:17.290
But at the same
time, you don't want

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:20.470
to block to user with
having a big login pop-up

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:23.110
or something like that or
blocking the experience.

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:25.300
So as you can see
at the bottom here,

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:28.100
we're offering them
automatic sign-in

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:31.300
on the web, which
is really nice.

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:33.790
And code wise, it's
quite easy to do.

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:36.940
You use something called
navigator.credentials.

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:39.910
And then you call the get
method to get the password

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:41.680
and sign them in.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.300
The interesting
and important part

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:47.130
here is where you see
what it says unmediated.

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:49.510
And what unmediated
means is that it

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:53.040
will be no prompt or nothing
blocking the experience.

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.760
It will just be done
in the background

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:58.340
automatically for the user.

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:01.810
For automatic sign-in
and from the Chrome site

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:06.770
to get it to work, automatic
sign-in needs to be enabled.

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:08.300
And you can only
have one credential

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:11.420
saved for that website.

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:14.810
Also as mentioned before, and
as many, many other things,

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:18.500
navigator.credentials needs
to be served over HTTPS.

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.900
So it has to be
a secure context.

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:24.230
Naturally passwords aren't
directly exposed to JavaScript.

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.870
And also the fetch method
would only submit credentials

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:30.070
to the same site endpoint.

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:32.840
So once you've gotten the
credentials from the user.

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:36.300
You can use fetch and just
send that into the server.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:41.420
Pass in the credentials, and
verify them, and log them in.

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:43.210
If that isn't an
option for you, you

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:47.620
can use one-tap sign-in, which
is more of having the prompter.

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:48.820
So you go to the website.

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:49.810
The prompt comes up.

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:51.070
You choose your account.

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:53.070
And you sign-in.

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:57.150
And code wise, it looks almost
exactly as what you saw before.

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:58.960
The only thing
that's been removed

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:02.320
is the word where
we had unmediated.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:05.569
Otherwise it's
just the same code.

00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:08.800
And getting the credentials
and sign-in them automatically

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.660
is great.

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:13.410
But you also want to give
the developers the ability

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:17.032
to choose when the save the
password prompt is triggered.

00:17:17.032 --> 00:17:18.990
When should this actually
come up for the user?

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:21.130
When is a good time?

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:23.805
And the way you can do that
is that you, for instance, can

00:17:23.805 --> 00:17:25.890
get a reference to the form.

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:28.200
And then you create
a new password

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:31.050
credential object
and pass in that form

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:32.890
and then store that value.

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:36.120
So again, just a nicer user
experience when it makes sense

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:38.370
to actually store that,
instead of blocking them

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:41.280
in the middle of
doing something.

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.620
We also support federated
logins through the Credential

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:47.020
Management API, which
could be Facebook

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:50.200
and Google and other accounts.

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.270
And doing that,
it's just creating

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:54.790
a new federated
credential object.

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:56.320
And you pass in the username.

00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:01.250
And you also pass in the URL
of the provider for the login.

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:04.890
And the browser will deal
with the rest of the process.

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:08.990
It's also important to
let the user be logged out

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:10.150
when they're done.

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:11.816
And especially if
you're using something

00:18:11.816 --> 00:18:13.610
like Autofill or
automatic sign-in,

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:15.410
you don't want to
automatically be sign-in

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:19.070
if someone else loads
it or has access to it.

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:21.920
So you can just call
requireUserMediation

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:24.290
to log them out.

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:26.300
And we've seen a number
of companies starting

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:27.800
working with this already.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:31.130
And some of them have
it in production.

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:34.730
So we shipped this
back in Chrome 51.

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:36.590
So please try out
these websites.

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:40.350
And try out that experience.

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:43.050
Next I want to talk about
paying for things on the web.

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:47.550
And I think this is probably
the most important topic.

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:50.320
If we see the success
of native apps,

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:52.050
it's been mainly
based on how easy it

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:55.170
to pay for things, to get
apps or services or something

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:58.350
like that, and then just keep
on using what you're using.

00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:02.220
And we really need to get
this right on the web.

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:04.055
And with the rise
of mobile computing,

00:19:04.055 --> 00:19:06.180
the majority of
commercial traffic

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:08.700
is coming from mobile devices.

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:11.160
And even though it's been
good in native, what's

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:16.710
really surprising is that
still, 66% of purchases

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:20.310
on mobile devices are on
the web, not native apps,

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:22.080
through the mobile web.

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:27.360
So the web, again,
isn't really dead yet.

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:30.030
And we looked at some
countries in Europe

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:32.460
and seeing how many of them
were using the mobile web.

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:39.790
And as you can see,
it's sort of a trend.

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:44.520
It's around 66% per country.

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:48.600
And also a bit small,
but we can also

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.630
see, which I really find
interesting digging into,

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:55.410
is seeing four different
actions what users prefer

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:58.590
to use to do that,
if they want to use

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:03.230
a website or an application
or something like that.

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:04.450
So that's great.

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:08.680
People are already,
despite some annoyances,

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.110
shopping on the mobile web.

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:16.900
But still we see 66% fewer
conversions on the mobile web

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:19.210
versus desktop websites.

00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:22.750
So it's still a lot of
money, a lot of shopping.

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:24.110
But it could be a lot more.

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:26.450
We could to help
users a lot more.

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:30.130
And the reason why it's so much
lower on mobile, of course,

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:34.120
is it's still hard on mobile.

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.970
And usually you see
a number of people

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:40.440
just giving up in
the check out flow

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:43.610
when they're trying to
finalize their purchase.

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:47.110
So looking at check out
forums today [INAUDIBLE],

00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:49.220
they are manual.

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:50.110
They are tedious.

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:52.680
They take a lot of
time to fill out,

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:56.170
and also requires a
certain amount of taps

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:57.880
to actually get
through all of that.

00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.830
And on all mobile
keyboard's, if you're

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:03.260
supposed to, for instance, type
in your credit card number,

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:06.130
16 numbers, and you don't
even get the number keyboard

00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:08.680
on your phone, it's hard.

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:09.430
And it's annoying.

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:12.330
And people give up.

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:16.680
So again trying to balance
it from the browser side,

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.680
we're working with
Autofill, just making sure

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:22.045
that you can start
something in one field

00:21:22.045 --> 00:21:23.670
and then just fill
out the entire form.

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:25.440
Because usually when
you fill out forms,

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.750
you more or less fill it
out with the same data

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:30.450
as you're done before.

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:33.540
And the way Autofill
works is just

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:35.700
storing the user's
address and credit

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.910
card and different
things into the browser

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:41.150
and then having
automatic form detection.

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:46.250
And we see about 95%
accuracy with our Autofill.

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:49.020
And then also if
you want to, Chrome

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:51.180
can synchronize that
securely between

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:52.770
all your different devices.

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:54.770
So for instance, if you
use Chrome on your phone

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:57.660
and your desktop all
your Autofill information

00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:00.240
can be synchronized
between those two.

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:03.990
And when it comes to conversion
rate, with Autofill alone,

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:07.894
we now see 25%
increase in conversion.

00:22:07.894 --> 00:22:08.560
So that's great.

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:12.930
And then we can't really do
everything to make it happen.

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:15.120
But it's one of the
steps of getting

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:18.640
closer to where it should be.

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:21.120
So Autofill's been good.

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:22.660
It's being more automatic.

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:24.980
And it's making it simple.

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:27.430
But it's still slow with
forms on the the web.

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:30.460
And it still takes a
certain amount of taps.

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:33.610
So imagine a world
without forms.

00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:37.360
And it would be
an amazing world.

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:40.210
And that's actually
what we're trying to do.

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:43.450
And with something
called PaymentRequest.

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:48.640
And PaymentRequest is
W3C API to just eliminate

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:51.940
all kinds of checkout paints.

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:54.030
And it's a simple
JavaScript API.

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:56.380
And the browser will take
care of the complicated parts

00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:57.370
of the payment.

00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:00.910
And you can actually
get a one tap checkout.

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:07.050
And this is also an openly
developed standard API.

00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:11.870
Currently it's under development
in W3C Payments Working Group.

00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:16.470
And their idea is to create
universal cross-browser

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:18.090
standard for any website.

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:21.390
So this is not a
Chrome only API.

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:24.110
We really want to see it
across all major browsers.

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:28.050
And we see interest from all
the big browsers actually doing

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:28.660
this as well.

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:31.050
For instance, Microsoft have
been doing lots of good work

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:33.080
around this.

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.670
And the implementation that
we started doing in Chrome

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:39.820
has been on mobile first.

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:41.920
But then of course, over
time we want to make sure

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.720
that it's cross platform.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:46.210
So it works on desktop
and any other device

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:48.610
as well, and also
that we can support

00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:51.430
an open ecosystem of
different payment methods

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:54.740
as well, which of
course is important.

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:57.770
So going back to
the pain of forms,

00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:00.530
now with Autofill
and PaymentRequest,

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:03.470
we can get rid of
pretty much everything.

00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:07.250
So we can now make it fast and
go from many different taps

00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:09.440
to just one tap
checkouts, which is

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:13.730
great I really
think it will change

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:15.350
the experience for users.

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:17.240
And you get much
higher conversions.

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.580
And everyone will be happy.

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:20.281
And we like happy people.

00:24:23.227 --> 00:24:26.010
Code wise, this is
what it looks like.

00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:29.390
So you will create a new
PaymentRequest object.

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:31.130
And then the first
parameter you see

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:34.070
here is just passing in
the different credit cards,

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:37.430
in this case, that you support.

00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:42.590
And then the browser can use
the different available methods

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:45.050
and then go through
all the other parts.

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:47.630
These are all the line items
for what you're buying.

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:49.970
And then finally
here at the bottom,

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:52.580
you can set a Boolean whether
you want to request a shipping

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:54.440
cost or not.

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:57.770
And I do want to point out that
our implementation and also

00:24:57.770 --> 00:25:01.130
the code that you're seeing here
is based on the first Public

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:02.910
Working draft by W3C.

00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:04.670
So it might change.

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:06.440
Most likely it will
look just like this.

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:10.340
But just a heads up that
it might actually change.

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:13.070
So the user experience for
someone going in and buying

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:17.550
something is that when you
choose to pay for something,

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:19.850
this pops up.

00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:20.900
You choose pay.

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:22.890
And then with the
shipping, for instance,

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:25.510
if they requested
a shipping cost,

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:27.710
you choose what kind
of shipping you want.

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:29.190
And then you process request.

00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:31.700
And you bought something.

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:33.410
Which I think this is amazing.

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:36.640
I think this will
change things a lot.

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:41.420
But of course, credit
cards isn't the only thing.

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:44.530
We're also looking into other
different payment options.

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:46.970
And we launched
Android Pay last year.

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:50.270
And we've seen a really big
growth around Android Pay.

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:52.760
We believe that it
needs to be on the web.

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:56.840
And we see it as even more
secure tokenized version

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:59.230
of your card.

00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:01.570
So as we saw before with
different payment methods,

00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:03.910
if you want to use something
else from credit cards,

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:06.230
you can just add that
in the first parameter.

00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:08.720
So you would have Visa,
MasterCard, et cetera.

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:12.040
And then you have a
URL to Android Pay.

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:14.710
And down here, you can see
all the different parameters

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:18.340
that you might need to
send in to Android Pay.

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:20.890
And the idea with
this, right now we only

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:21.760
support Android Pay.

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.440
But the idea over
time, of course,

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:26.770
is to support a number of other
different payment providers

00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:29.660
as well, which is vital
to make this work.

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:33.130
So this API should look the
same over time no matter

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:34.750
which payment provider you use.

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:37.750
The only difference will
be maybe different values

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:41.320
you will send in to actually
make the actual payment.

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:45.460
And we started back
in May trying this out

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:48.750
in Chrome Dev on Android.

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:53.050
And then back in August,
we went into beta.

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:56.830
And then we shipped it
in Chrome 53 for Android.

00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:58.780
And then next
year, we're looking

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:03.010
to support more platforms and
also support more third party

00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:05.350
payment providers as well.

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:09.340
And again, a few companies
have started working with this.

00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:14.380
So if you buy something
from these companies online

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:18.400
or through mobile
websites, please let them

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:19.870
know how it actually works.

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:22.150
Let us know how it works.

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:26.230
And let W3C know how it works,
because it's really, really

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:27.610
important that we
get this right.

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:30.910
And we can offer good payment
options for you on the web.

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:36.250
So far we've talked about
making it way easier for users

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:37.060
to log in.

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:41.140
Everything's automatic,
automatic sign-ins, one tap

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:43.030
payment and all of that.

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:44.680
So what about
connecting the hardware?

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:53.310
And the web has had access
to hardware for some time

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:57.510
actually with accelerometers,
game controllers, camera,

00:27:57.510 --> 00:27:59.920
audio input and
output, and such.

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:02.100
So when I talk about
hardware, I talk

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:07.080
more about Bluetooth and
devices like heart rate sensors

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:08.790
and similar.

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:10.980
And usually when we
talk about Bluetooth,

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:13.890
you talk about something
called BLE which

00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:15.570
is version four Bluetooth.

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:19.610
And BLE stands for
Bluetooth Low Energy.

00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:23.630
And looking at the
evolution of transfer rates,

00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:27.630
we see in Wi-Fi and Ethernet,
it just gets faster and faster

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:29.270
to transfer things.

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:33.740
And with Bluetooth, it went
from one megabits per second,

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:35.540
to three, to 54.

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:39.720
So you would expect that
version four is amazing.

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:43.620
Well, not really
what you expected.

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:47.640
And the reason for this,
why transfer speed was

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:53.400
cut down dramatically
and almost nonexistent,

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:56.430
is because two main factors--

00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:57.690
power and cost.

00:28:57.690 --> 00:28:59.850
And with all of these
low energy devices,

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:03.240
you want to make sure that
they use as less battery as

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:06.660
possible, so it can last without
being charged or connected

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:07.740
all the time.

00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:10.950
And the other part is the
cost of producing these.

00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:14.070
Producing something with a
lower transfer rate is cheaper.

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:18.390
So we can produce more
different devices and faster.

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:21.130
And through the
web, we've connected

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:25.120
through remote controlled
racecars, Bluetooth Low Energy

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:26.890
printers.

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:32.310
You might recognize this guy,
the BB8 remote control robot.

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:35.030
But it also connected
things like Dotty,

00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:37.750
which is a Bluetooth LED
notification display, so

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:39.490
many different things.

00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:44.520
So I wonder, should I be
brave enough and try a demo?

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:47.270
Yeah, thank you.

00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:48.230
We'll see.

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:50.570
Well don't clap yet.

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:53.900
We'll see how it goes.

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:58.010
So this is a Bluetooth
Low Energy device

00:29:58.010 --> 00:29:59.690
called a Play Bulb Candle.

00:29:59.690 --> 00:30:01.590
It's basically just
setting the mood.

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:03.631
And you're going to have
different colors and all

00:30:03.631 --> 00:30:04.360
of that.

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:09.970
But what I can do is that
I can get my mobile phone.

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:21.220
What I will be doing on my
phone is that I go into Chrome.

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:24.080
And I load a website.

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:25.670
And then I tap Connect.

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:28.820
And I get a list of available
Bluetooth devices nearby.

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:33.210
And I can see the
Play Bulb Candle here.

00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:35.970
So now I pair with the Candle.

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:38.590
And now I can control
the colors of the Candle

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:39.764
but also what it looks like.

00:30:39.764 --> 00:30:40.930
So I can change the effects.

00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:57.470
I know.

00:30:57.470 --> 00:30:58.950
It's amazing, right?

00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:02.360
But the interesting thing
is that it's directly

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:04.970
from a web page, no extra
installs, no nothing.

00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:07.410
If you want to use the services,
especially in most cases,

00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:08.910
you only want to
use a service once.

00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:10.670
You just go to URL and use it.

00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:12.650
And you're done.

00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:16.160
And since this is
supposed to be a candle,

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.520
do you think I can blow it out?

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:21.230
Let's try.

00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:23.932
Ha, pretty cool.

00:31:23.932 --> 00:31:27.740
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:31.430
And this demo is
available on GitHub.

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:34.860
And I can show you more
later if you want to.

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:36.890
And when you work with
Bluetooth Low Energy,

00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:40.430
there are a few terms to
know, three different things.

00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:44.180
You have the central device,
which is the phone in this case

00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:44.930
.

00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:46.640
You have the peripheral
device, which

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:49.100
is the candle or any kind of
Bluetooth Low Energy thing

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:50.460
that you connect to.

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:53.780
But you also have the GATT,
which is the generic ATTribute

00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:54.590
profile.

00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:57.500
So basically the Bluetooth
Low Energy device

00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:59.040
has a GATT server.

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:01.280
And then you can
ask the GATT server

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:04.010
of this candle what
kind of services

00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:07.640
and the characteristics
it supports.

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:13.190
So with the coder, you can
call navigator.Bluetooth.

00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:16.280
And as you see, the first
parameter here is mandatory.

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:19.220
And it is what kind of
service you want to ask for.

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:23.570
And the reason for that is if
you asked for Bluetooth devices

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:26.120
close to you, you will
get a very long list.

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:28.130
So you only want to
ask for a device that

00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:32.850
actually supports the thing
that you want to do right now.

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:36.120
Also the request
device method needs

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:38.710
to be called with a user action.

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:40.620
So basically you can't
just automatically do

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:41.640
this for a user.

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:44.910
They need to tap a button
or something like that.

00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:46.920
This, again, like
the other ones,

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:49.434
it's only supported over HTTPS.

00:32:49.434 --> 00:32:50.850
But if you want
to try it out, you

00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:53.940
can also try it on local
host on your machines.

00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:57.290
And it will work as well.

00:32:57.290 --> 00:33:01.260
And once you actually manage
to pair with the device,

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:05.880
you connect to the GATT
server of that device.

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:09.160
And basically you get
back that connection.

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:13.740
And once you've gotten that,
you can get the primary service,

00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:15.610
battery service in this case.

00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:18.840
And once you have that, you
can check the characteristic,

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:20.680
which is the battery level.

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:23.550
Once you have that, you
can read out the value

00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:29.600
and see, for instance, just the
actual battery of that device.

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:32.652
Same thing with the
candle and changing it,

00:33:32.652 --> 00:33:34.110
the way we do it
with the candle is

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:36.690
that you have the primary
service, which is the candle

00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:40.040
service UUID, and then
the characteristic, which

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:42.320
is candle caller UUID.

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.910
And then instead you call
the right value method.

00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:46.490
So basically you
pass in the caller,

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:50.120
for instance, that you
want the candle to have.

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:53.730
And if you look at these values
like candle service UUID,

00:33:53.730 --> 00:33:55.720
they seem magical.

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:59.020
How do you know what
it's actually named?

00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:01.930
If you're lucky, when you get
a Bluetooth Low Energy device,

00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:04.840
it will have a programming
guide with all these things

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:05.620
specified.

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:10.179
But if not, you can install
control software on Android

00:34:10.179 --> 00:34:13.350
and also turn on the
developer options in Settings.

00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:15.940
And then you can capture
all the Bluetooth packets.

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:17.098
And then you get the log.

00:34:17.098 --> 00:34:18.639
And within that log,
you can actually

00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:23.070
see the different values
and names of all of these.

00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:24.850
You can also have
event listeners.

00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:28.130
Like with this candle, I'm
glad it actually worked.

00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:29.830
But when you blow
it out, you can

00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:35.110
have an event listener to see if
the value of any characteristic

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:35.920
is changing.

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:38.940
So you can see, for instance,
oh, it was actually blown out.

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:43.280
Now I'm going to do
something else with it.

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.219
Then we have WebNFC coming.

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:59.190
And it's basically what
it says, that on the web,

00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:02.070
you can connect
through NFC to devices

00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:07.980
nearby and get JSON back
and then parse that format.

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:12.030
And I do recommend following
the work by a Danish friend

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:14.040
of mine, Kenneth Christiansen.

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:16.060
This is actually the best
picture I have of him.

00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:18.690
So I worked a long time
to get a better one.

00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:20.480
But I couldn't.

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:22.730
And you should follow
his work, because he's

00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:25.940
working both with
the WebNFC stuff

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:29.180
but also something
called Generic Sensors.

00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:31.030
And basically the idea
with Generic Sensors

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:34.640
is that you would have a
generally specified API

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:36.580
for different kinds of sensors.

00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:40.670
So you could have direct tire
pressure sensor for your car.

00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:42.420
So if you wanted,
through JavaScript,

00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:46.010
to check the value of
your left front tire

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:50.332
or something like that,
you can get that back.

00:35:50.332 --> 00:35:52.040
And also you could
work with other things

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:55.640
like geo location
sensors and other values

00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:59.000
and get on error an on
change event handlers.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.820
And the idea with this
and the previous example,

00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:03.784
it could basically
be any sensor.

00:36:03.784 --> 00:36:06.200
And it should be implemented
and accessed in the same way.

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:07.820
You just have the
name of the sensor

00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:12.190
and then the same calls,
the same methods, et cetera.

00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:14.460
And talking about
physical devices

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:17.280
and talking about
web Bluetooth, I

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:19.890
want to talk briefly about
another project called

00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:21.190
Physical Web.

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:24.000
And Physical Web is
basically about beacons.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.140
You would have really,
really small things

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:28.140
that they put out there.

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:32.880
And the only thing that they
do is that a broadcast a URL.

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:36.210
So if you're close to one
of these with your device,

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:39.750
you will get a notification
on your phone with the URL.

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:41.340
And then you tap
that notification.

00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:43.120
And it will take
you to that URL.

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:47.230
And it could be any kind of
information in that page.

00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:49.260
But the interesting
part is about,

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:51.900
with the physical
beacons, it's only things

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:54.540
that you are actually close to.

00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:56.400
So if you would walk
around in a mall,

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:59.190
you can walk by a
store with shoes.

00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:00.422
And it could send out a URL.

00:37:00.422 --> 00:37:01.380
And you would tap that.

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:03.600
And it will tell you that
they have a sale today,

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:05.770
for instance.

00:37:05.770 --> 00:37:07.710
Or if you're on
the train station,

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:09.550
you can get a notification.

00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:13.290
And then you can follow the
URL and see the timetable.

00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:15.630
Or parking your car,
you can actually

00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:17.634
access the parking meter
from within the car

00:37:17.634 --> 00:37:19.050
so you don't even
have to get out.

00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:22.470
And you can pay for
parking, et cetera.

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:25.670
So it's an easy way of
just giving information

00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:29.580
to people close to where
they are right now.

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:32.820
But it also in the future,
looking into interacting more

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:34.710
with these beacons
through something

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:37.320
called referring device.

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:41.180
And the idea with this is
that with the physical beacons

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:44.390
that you could connect to them
through their GATT server.

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:47.830
And then you can also start
to control things on them

00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:51.380
or directly interface
with them through the web.

00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:55.400
And we've seen a bunch of
experimental implementations

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:58.430
so far with web Bluetooth.

00:37:58.430 --> 00:38:01.010
Chrome and Opera has had
the first implementations.

00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:03.710
And we work on making
them more and more stable.

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:05.970
And we've seen a
really huge developer

00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:09.140
interest with web Bluetooth and
the things that we can create.

00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:11.630
We're hoping to see more
browsers start implementing it

00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:14.825
soon as well.

00:38:14.825 --> 00:38:19.200
I also want to talk about
virtual reality briefly.

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:25.500
And we've seen good
progress on 1.0 of the API.

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:27.330
So about two months
ago, the first version

00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:28.740
landed in Firefox.

00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:31.320
And they've been doing
really great work on v.r.

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:32.760
VR.

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:36.900
We're getting closer to that
as well with Chrome this year.

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:41.940
And Microsoft Edge has also
begun development on VR

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:43.740
in the browser.

00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:48.430
And about six months ago,
we have a one time per year

00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:52.440
our a big developer
conference called Google I/O.

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:56.250
And at Google I/O, we,
six months ago in May, we

00:38:56.250 --> 00:38:59.010
announced something
called Daydream.

00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:01.080
And basically what
Daydream is, it's

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:04.470
a specification
for VR experiences.

00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:09.270
So it's more of having a
reference design for a headset

00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:11.820
that should have a headband.

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:14.840
It should have a remote
control similar to this one.

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:17.247
And at the top of the remote
control, it's a clicker.

00:39:17.247 --> 00:39:18.330
But it's also a touch pad.

00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:20.600
So you can move your
thumb around and control

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:21.700
things and all of that.

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:24.240
And then you have below
that one the action button,

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:26.650
and then one home button.

00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:31.410
And the first ones we shipped
was with one headset made out

00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:34.399
of cloth, which is
soft and nice to wear,

00:39:34.399 --> 00:39:36.690
because especially if you're
going to wear it over time

00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:38.520
and watching videos or
something like that,

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:41.700
it should be comfortable and
not like a big piece of plastic

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:43.140
in your face.

00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:46.150
People don't seem to like that.

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:48.519
But that's only
one of the options.

00:39:48.519 --> 00:39:50.560
But we're seeing a number
of different providers,

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:54.020
from Samsung and LG and
more also building devices.

00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:56.480
So it's not a Google-only thing.

00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:58.450
But it's more of
something that will work

00:39:58.450 --> 00:39:59.900
across the board on Android.

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:03.010
And you're going to see more
headsets, more remote controls,

00:40:03.010 --> 00:40:04.750
and more experiences.

00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:06.640
And if you're
interested in VR, I

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:12.270
do recommend a project by
Mozilla called A-Frame.

00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:15.700
And it's designed by
the Mozilla VR team.

00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:17.320
And basically what
it does is that it

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:23.710
wraps a library called 3.js
and WebGL in custom elements

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:24.640
in HTML.

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:26.740
So it's a really nice
way of getting started,

00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:31.090
playing with it, see
if you like it or not.

00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:32.710
A few months ago
as well, we also

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:35.750
shipped something called
VR View for the web.

00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:39.790
So if you have a content
like 360 images or 360 videos

00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:42.580
or something like that,
basically what you do

00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:45.375
is that you embed it in your
web page with an I-frame.

00:40:45.375 --> 00:40:46.210
You point to a URL.

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:49.840
And you have a small JavaScript
library to handle it.

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:52.660
And if you're on a desktop
computer, and if you click,

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:54.940
you can click and drag
and look around and then

00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:56.140
see what it's like.

00:40:56.140 --> 00:41:01.150
But also if you have a VR
viewer, Cardboard or similar,

00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:02.725
you can just put your phone in.

00:41:02.725 --> 00:41:06.750
And then you get a full on VR
experience with that as well.

00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:09.010
So it's a nice easy
way of getting started.

00:41:09.010 --> 00:41:13.160
And especially for hotels or
travel websites and all that,

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:16.120
getting more of a feeling
for what it's like

00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:18.230
for where you're going.

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:22.920
And we've also seen interesting
implications from Oculus.

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:25.650
One of the co-founders of
Oculus is a big supporter

00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:27.810
of VR on the web as well.

00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:32.190
And what Facebook announced
about one, two months ago

00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:35.160
at their conference
on Oculus was also

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:40.240
showing more of an
effort of supporting web.

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:43.150
And also, and it's been said
before today, why we're here

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:45.492
is that we're really
here to, of course,

00:41:45.492 --> 00:41:47.200
try and tell you about
some of the things

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:49.810
that we are working on,
but more importantly

00:41:49.810 --> 00:41:52.120
to hear from you what
you need, what we can do

00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:53.640
to make things better for you.

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:56.920
What are the biggest
challenges as developers?

00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:00.310
What are the things that we
need to do better for you?

00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:03.970
And also with bug reporting,
for instance and those

00:42:03.970 --> 00:42:05.365
things helps a lot.

00:42:09.830 --> 00:42:13.520
I should also mention with
all the different browser

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:17.000
vendors, for a long time,
this is what it looked like.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.799
You had the big five, the
big browsers on desktop.

00:42:21.799 --> 00:42:23.590
But that's not really
where we are anymore.

00:42:23.590 --> 00:42:26.750
If we look on mobile, there's
so many different options

00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:27.680
right now for users.

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:37.220
And you would have anything from
QQ to UC to Samsung browser,

00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:39.260
and much, much more.

00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:42.440
And I think this
is really what's

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:44.900
both important and
beautiful about the web,

00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:48.450
that the users have so
many different options.

00:42:48.450 --> 00:42:51.710
They can use whatever they
like and what they prefer.

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:55.370
So the web to me is kind
of like a mix of very

00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:57.980
many different kinds of things.

00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:01.370
I have no idea
what this is about.

00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:03.920
But at the same time
that's the beauty.

00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:08.600
It's a mix of all
kinds of experiences.

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:11.030
And that's the way it should be.

00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:16.020
And summarizing all this, the
way I see the future of the web

00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:19.200
is not necessarily going
crazy with technology.

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:22.290
But it's about offering
a way better experience

00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:26.750
for users and for developers.

00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:28.620
[SPEAKING MANDARIN]

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:33.920
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:55.410
SPEAKER 1: [SPEAKING MANDARIN]

00:43:55.410 --> 00:43:57.340
AUDIENCE: My English
is not so good.

00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:02.770
But your talk is very
important for me.

00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:13.060
You just show a web application
to control the Bluetooth light.

00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:23.200
And I see the code is
use GATT tools library.

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:27.335
I find this library
very long time.

00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:34.570
Where did you find it?

00:44:34.570 --> 00:44:36.490
ROBERT NYMAN: A library for--

00:44:36.490 --> 00:44:39.670
AUDIENCE: GATT tools.

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:43.100
ROBERT NYMAN: I
haven't used that one.

00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:44.980
AUDIENCE: What?

00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:47.376
ROBERT NYMAN: So--
sorry, say again?

00:44:47.376 --> 00:44:48.800
AUDIENCE: What?

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:51.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:54.190 --> 00:44:56.132
SPEAKER 1: [SPEAKING MANDARIN]

00:44:56.132 --> 00:45:01.400
AUDIENCE: GATT tools, G-A-T-T.

00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:05.100
ROBERT NYMAN: Oh, like
the GATT, the GATT server?

00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:06.770
Oh, OK.

00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:12.580
So if I understand correctly,
so you have, like with this,

00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:15.820
it has GATT server,
which will tell you

00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:18.760
what you can access on it.

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:22.660
And depending on what Bluetooth
device you buy, some of them

00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:27.580
have manuals or guides
telling you how to access it

00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:30.070
and what it's all called.

00:45:30.070 --> 00:45:34.150
But sometimes you need to
turn on logging and Android

00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:39.310
and developer tools and do a
packet sniffing to get the log.

00:45:39.310 --> 00:45:42.930
And then you need to read
through it to find the names.

00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:46.450
We can probably find as well
some good option for you

00:45:46.450 --> 00:45:51.220
where to get started, if that's
what you're trying to find.

00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:54.990
AUDIENCE: Is this
tools open source?

00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:58.440
ROBERT NYMAN: I believe so.

00:45:58.440 --> 00:45:59.950
I can check.

00:45:59.950 --> 00:46:03.420
One of my colleagues is
the Mr. web Bluetooth.

00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:06.660
So I can ask him about
the best tools for that.

00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:10.760
And then I can
share it with you.

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:17.212
AUDIENCE: Could you show the
GitHub that you just showed?

00:46:17.212 --> 00:46:18.920
ROBERT NYMAN: Not
right now, because Pete

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:22.610
wanted his computer back.

00:46:22.610 --> 00:46:25.947
If you come up, I can
share with you later.

00:46:25.947 --> 00:46:26.780
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:27.779
ROBERT NYMAN: Thank you.

00:46:35.590 --> 00:46:38.722
AUDIENCE: So you have talked
about how to make logging

00:46:38.722 --> 00:46:40.600
into a website simple.

00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:46.480
So I think that Turing test
also block our log in a lot.

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:51.130
So my question is what is
the future for Turing test?

00:46:51.130 --> 00:46:56.110
Do you think how some
way to make it easier?

00:46:56.110 --> 00:46:59.650
ROBERT NYMAN: So the
future of the Turing test?

00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:00.500
The Turing test.

00:47:03.402 --> 00:47:08.020
I think I can't really answer
what the future of that test

00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:08.560
would be.

00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:10.060
It's an interesting
conversation.

00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:14.406
But you should ask
Sam about that.

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:21.280
But I think it's an
interesting question.

00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:25.180
I think more and more, like
in all kinds of experiences,

00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:28.990
it's making more and more
automatic and personalized

00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:31.530
without having you
think about it.

00:47:31.530 --> 00:47:37.957
You assume that things work
according to what you expect.

00:47:37.957 --> 00:47:39.540
SPEAKER 2: I think
an interesting part

00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:43.650
of that is thinking about what's
the future of the web on voice

00:47:43.650 --> 00:47:48.680
interaction devices,
on Echo or Google Home.

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:51.150
Where's the web?

00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:54.300
There's no reason why there's
not a future on those devices.

00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:55.440
But how will that work?

00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:58.470
And when that becomes
something that

00:47:58.470 --> 00:48:01.220
might pass the Turing test,
that's interesting I think.

00:48:05.310 --> 00:48:06.830
AUDIENCE: Here's
another question.

00:48:06.830 --> 00:48:11.290
So the audience is
interested in how do we

00:48:11.290 --> 00:48:15.930
calculate the stats about
the most popular password,

00:48:15.930 --> 00:48:17.820
like in 2015?

00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:18.920
So what's the source?

00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:20.500
ROBERT NYMAN: So
how we calculate

00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:22.390
the most popular password?

00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:25.130
It's a secret.

00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:27.760
No, there is--

00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:28.670
I can dig it up.

00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:33.070
But there are resources
that do surveys and tests

00:48:33.070 --> 00:48:35.450
and all that to calculate that.

00:48:35.450 --> 00:48:38.930
So we actually don't-- we
or not anyone else, I hope,

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:42.582
know the password of every
user in the entire world.

00:48:42.582 --> 00:48:44.290
SPEAKER 3: I just
wanted to toss on that.

00:48:44.290 --> 00:48:47.080
A lot of that data
comes from websites

00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:51.580
that have been either leaked
or hacked their password lists.

00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:53.360
And then people then
just compile them.

00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:56.020
So that's not anything
that we came up with.

00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:58.290
That's something from
an external site.

00:48:58.290 --> 00:49:00.040
ROBERT NYMAN: We don't
know your password.

00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:01.540
We don't want to
know your password.

00:49:15.310 --> 00:49:17.130
AUDIENCE: Hi, I
have one question

00:49:17.130 --> 00:49:24.850
about password to another one,
and about Android Pay, the web

00:49:24.850 --> 00:49:25.360
pay.

00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:32.140
Sorry You say Chrome will
save the password, user name.

00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:35.140
I'm kind of worried about safe.

00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:41.995
Is that enough safe about
a password in the web pay?

00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:46.880
ROBERT NYMAN: So the
way we store that,

00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:51.260
even before Payments, we've
been storing passwords

00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:52.640
through Chrome for a long time.

00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:54.470
And of course, we
can't see the passwords

00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:57.260
that are being all
encrypted and beyond us.

00:49:57.260 --> 00:50:01.350
You need to login as a user
to be able to use that.

00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:04.040
Like in Chrome, you
can go into Settings

00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:06.500
and see all the
password that you saved.

00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:08.690
But you need to
enter your own master

00:50:08.690 --> 00:50:12.770
password to be able to
see them or read them out.

00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:15.650
And it's the same thing
for Payments as well.

00:50:15.650 --> 00:50:20.010
So for instance, the way it
works in Chrome right now,

00:50:20.010 --> 00:50:23.150
so for me, let's say I
would want to book my flight

00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:24.500
to come here.

00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:27.290
I go into the airline
company's website.

00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:28.640
And I see that form.

00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:31.100
And then Chrome understands
that the credit card

00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:33.680
field is a credit card field.

00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:36.290
So if I double
click on that field,

00:50:36.290 --> 00:50:39.060
it pops up the credit cards
that I have saved in there.

00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:40.520
So I can't see
the entire number.

00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:43.980
But I can see the last four
digits or something like that.

00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:46.430
So let's say I choose
my credit card.

00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:48.170
And it gets auto filled.

00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:51.170
I still need to
fill out the code

00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:53.690
on the back side
of the credit card

00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:56.300
to verify that it's actually me.

00:50:56.300 --> 00:51:00.980
So you have small means of
still being in the control.

00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:04.440
Pin codes are similar,
verifying that--

00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:10.000
AUDIENCE: That means the
password is not that important.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.200
ROBERT NYMAN: It depends.

00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:17.320
But I think, with any
kind of password handling,

00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:19.380
it's extremely sensitive.

00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:22.230
And of course, for us it's
very important to make sure

00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:24.776
that it's secure for users.

00:51:24.776 --> 00:51:26.400
I don't know how many
years people have

00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:30.090
been able to save passwords
in Chrome and Firefox

00:51:30.090 --> 00:51:32.460
and all the other
browsers, Safari.

00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:34.800
But there are methods
of making sure that they

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:37.440
are as safe as possible.

00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:40.620
So like Pete said, if
it would get hacked,

00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:42.220
it's so safe and encrypted.

00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:45.370
So no one should be able
to actually read it out.

00:51:45.370 --> 00:51:46.203
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:51:57.010 --> 00:51:58.930
SPEAKER 1: [SPEAKING MANDARIN]

00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:10.400
So if no more questions,
you can go to first floor.

00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:11.432
There's a party.

00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:16.160
Enjoy.

00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:19.210
[APPLAUSE]
