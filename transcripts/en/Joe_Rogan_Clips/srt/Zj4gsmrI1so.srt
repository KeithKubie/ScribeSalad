1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,850
You're an asshole though. Thank you. I
appreciate it. You're a very nice guy.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,200
You're just conservative. That's the
dirty little secret though. Yeah.

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:06,840
We're not supposed to do what
not supposed to talk about that,

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,290
but this is one of the things that
bothers me so much about you being so

5
00:00:10,291 --> 00:00:14,110
misrepresented. When I read things
about you, there was a, the,

6
00:00:14,111 --> 00:00:17,730
the article that we were just talking
about, the outright sage without the rage,

7
00:00:17,731 --> 00:00:20,370
they called you and you're not
even remotely alt right. In fact,

8
00:00:20,371 --> 00:00:25,371
you were the leading target of antisemitic
abuse for all of 2016 weren't you on

9
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,310
learning to the Anti Defamation
League, which is no LMI and so, yeah,

10
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:31,260
I mean I'm not only am I not all right,

11
00:00:31,261 --> 00:00:35,280
I've spent the last four years like
legitimately battling the alt right,

12
00:00:35,281 --> 00:00:37,320
talking about how evil,
I think their ideology is,

13
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:40,080
how evil I think white supremacy
is. I mean, first of all,

14
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,500
like people at the Yarmulke is typically
not the favorites of the outright.

15
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,460
And then beyond that,

16
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:49,490
I mean I think their
ideology is legitimately a
devastatingly awful twist on

17
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:52,860
what Western civilization is supposed
to be as amazing as a review of my new

18
00:00:52,861 --> 00:00:56,040
book and my new book has several sections
and they're dedicated to how terrible

19
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:56,874
the outright is.

20
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,990
And then the interview they did with me
doesn't talk about outright stuff at all,

21
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:03,390
but they just assume I'm
on the conservative, right?

22
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,610
That must mean that I am
outright and it's like, no,

23
00:01:05,611 --> 00:01:10,020
you stupid to say no problem with
no labels. They're disingenuous.

24
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:15,050
People are labeling people in a very
simple manner to try to categorize them as

25
00:01:15,151 --> 00:01:18,210
the enemy and instead of
just addressing these points,

26
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:22,440
like I love watching your debates where
you do Q and A's with college students

27
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:26,670
and with people in the audience because
you can see you agree with you or

28
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:29,040
disagree with who you have
well formulated ideas.

29
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,710
This isn't just some bullshit
that you're spouting out.

30
00:01:31,711 --> 00:01:33,040
You thought these things through.
I mean,

31
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,250
I've been doing this for legitimately
more than half of my life.

32
00:01:35,251 --> 00:01:39,090
I'm 35 and I started when I was 17 and
I started writing a syndicated column at

33
00:01:39,091 --> 00:01:42,280
that point and when you're 17 you think
a lot of dumb stuff and then sure you

34
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,870
get older and you educate yourself and
you spend a lot of time reading and a lot

35
00:01:45,871 --> 00:01:46,704
of time studying.

36
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,840
Hopefully you have some cogent arguments
after 20 years of doing anything and

37
00:01:50,841 --> 00:01:53,290
then, but it's the demonization
is pretty astonishing.

38
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:54,810
But we had an on Andrew Yang,

39
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,650
he's the only Democratic candidate who
has agreed to go on the Sunday special

40
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:01,620
that I do. We did a full hour
on ubi. It was perfectly nice.

41
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,200
It was perfectly coherent and and,

42
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,390
and conciliatory and yet people will
suggest that everything I do is about

43
00:02:09,391 --> 00:02:12,210
destroying people on the other side
because of all the Ben Shapiro destroys

44
00:02:12,211 --> 00:02:13,260
videos and all that kind of stuff.

45
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,650
There are certain groups of people
where that's their shtick there.

46
00:02:16,651 --> 00:02:21,270
Like they're goons, right? They just go
after people online for attention. Yes,

47
00:02:21,271 --> 00:02:24,180
this is a stick.
This is not you.

48
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,720
And this is what bothers me so much and
I know that you've said some things in

49
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:31,620
the past like particularly about Arabs
and like when you were a younger man that

50
00:02:31,621 --> 00:02:33,690
you said, I shouldn't have said
that. Yeah, that's exactly right.

51
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,910
That's exactly right. Some of those
things were taken out of context.

52
00:02:35,911 --> 00:02:38,070
Like that one particular tweet,
which is a bad tweet,

53
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,340
was a tweet that was
part of a tweet threaten,

54
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,920
which has specifically contrasting Israel
and the Hamas leadership and saying

55
00:02:43,921 --> 00:02:46,830
that the Israeli government likes to build
and the Hamas leadership would prefer

56
00:02:46,831 --> 00:02:51,120
that their citizens live in sewage and
bomb things. But that was a bad tweet.

57
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,820
Obviously my entire history on,

58
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,910
on Muslim relations is one I like.

59
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:01,150
I supported the ability of Ilhan to
where he job on the, on the floor.

60
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,980
I opposed. President Trump's
originally proposed Muslim ban, uh,

61
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,830
in the last three weeks
I've had on of Nawaz,

62
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,890
I've had on a contact
med I had on yesterday,

63
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,210
a reformed Muslim. Like
these are conversations that
have to be had, but to take,

64
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,580
this is one of the things
that bugs me so much. I've,

65
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,510
I've tweeted I think 140,000 times
I've written millions of words.

66
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,800
I'm sure you can find something. I don't
even remember having written it is bad.

67
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,060
I have a running list, by the way.
I try to be honest about this. I,

68
00:03:29,061 --> 00:03:31,480
I'm one of the only people I know who has,
I have a running list it's called.

69
00:03:31,481 --> 00:03:33,570
So here's a giant list of all the
dumb stuff I've ever done. Right?

70
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,980
And I actually go through all
this. You like, you can look it up.

71
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:37,300
This is not me saying this now.
I mean,

72
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:40,660
you can go and look up all the
things that I think I've done wrong,

73
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,670
and I'll apologize for some,
and I'll say somewhere dom,

74
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:45,580
and I'll say some I'm fine with,
and you're just taking out of context.

75
00:03:45,581 --> 00:03:48,250
But I mean that, I hope that's
what honest people try to do,

76
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,390
but does, this is the problem. You're
not dealing with. Honest people would,

77
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,140
when people try to categorize
you as outright or they're,

78
00:03:55,141 --> 00:03:59,260
they're trying to put you into this
category of Internet goon. There they in,

79
00:03:59,261 --> 00:04:00,930
they did quote tweet.

80
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,960
There's taking some little tiny phrase
you said seven years ago and trying to

81
00:04:06,031 --> 00:04:10,830
say, this is you, this is, you know, it's
so that's such a disingenuous thing to do.

82
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,050
I hate it.
And I hated across the aisle by the way,

83
00:04:13,051 --> 00:04:14,580
like I was a defender of James Gunn.

84
00:04:14,581 --> 00:04:17,190
I thought James Gunn shouldn't have
been fired from guardians of the galaxy.

85
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:19,960
Yeah. Over the old tweets about that.
They were just dumb jokes. Right?

86
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,970
That's exactly right.
Yeah.

87
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:24,000
And even if somebody tweeted
something bad like 10 years ago,

88
00:04:24,001 --> 00:04:28,170
bringing it up now is not an attempt to
actually make the public space better.

89
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,760
And you're not actually
offended by that thing.

90
00:04:29,761 --> 00:04:33,240
The person tweeted 10 years ago that you
didn't notice what it is that you want

91
00:04:33,241 --> 00:04:34,830
to get rid of this person
or hurt this person.

92
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,500
So you're going to bring up something
from 10 years ago and then you're going to

93
00:04:37,501 --> 00:04:39,060
try and club them into submission with it.

94
00:04:39,061 --> 00:04:41,130
Because if you actually ask
them their opinion about it,

95
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,950
they might have a more nuanced
view on what they said.

96
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,020
Maybe they apologize and they,
maybe they think,

97
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,230
I don't even remember saying that. Right.
I mean, I, I felt the same way by the way.

98
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:52,020
I try to be consistent.
I really do about about this stuff.

99
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,600
I said the same thing about,
for example, Ralph Northam,

100
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:59,310
the governor of Virginia who is excoriated
for having this terrible racist photo

101
00:04:59,311 --> 00:05:03,300
on his yearbook page back in
medical school in 1987 and
people were saying, well,

102
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,040
this is evidence he's racist
now. It's like, well no,

103
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,680
that's evidence that he was doing a
racist thing then that's not evidence that

104
00:05:07,681 --> 00:05:08,491
he's racist now.

105
00:05:08,491 --> 00:05:12,450
You sort of have to look over the broad
course of his career and he ended up

106
00:05:12,451 --> 00:05:14,430
doing what everyone now does,

107
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,460
which is you just don't
apologize for anything.

108
00:05:17,461 --> 00:05:18,950
You just try to pass it off as nothing.

109
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,830
The public space is actually getting
worse because let's say that you did

110
00:05:22,831 --> 00:05:25,650
something bad in the past.
There are a few human responses to,

111
00:05:25,651 --> 00:05:28,560
I did something I don't like in the past.
Human response number one is,

112
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:31,740
you know what? I apologize.
That was wrong these days.

113
00:05:31,741 --> 00:05:34,860
That gets your face step done, right?
You say, I apologize, I was wrong.

114
00:05:34,861 --> 00:05:37,830
It means what? Why did you do it in the
first place? Because you're a bad person.

115
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:41,430
Apologies are not accepted.
And then number two is you brazen it out.

116
00:05:41,431 --> 00:05:44,040
You do the Trump. You know what?
I never did anything wrong, ever.

117
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,780
I've never perfect right?
And that,

118
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,990
and then you get your defenders to come
and surround you and then nothing ever

119
00:05:48,991 --> 00:05:52,590
gets cleansed or opportunity. Number
three is you do what Barack Obama did,

120
00:05:52,591 --> 00:05:55,950
which is you come out preemptively and
you try to remember all the bad stuff you

121
00:05:55,951 --> 00:05:59,300
do and then you confess it in public in
dreams from my father. He says, right?

122
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,020
Well you know when I was back in high
school did a little blow. Everyone's like,

123
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:05,510
oh, okay, so you did cocaine when he
was in high school. That's, that's cool.

124
00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:08,390
Whereas if it comes out during the
campaign, right, it's stone, right?

125
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:11,840
Then he's got that he's got a real
problem. The problem is that right now,

126
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,990
even if you preemptively come out
and say, I did something wrong. Like,

127
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:15,681
for example,

128
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:19,970
Liam Neeson talking about years ago when
he had a racist thought that he didn't

129
00:06:19,971 --> 00:06:21,590
act on when he had a racist thought,

130
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:25,850
this is now we're going to try and ruin
your career for something that you admit

131
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:29,600
was bad that you did 30 years ago.
We're going to try and run you over that.

132
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,910
If you apologize for something
that you did 30 years ago,

133
00:06:31,911 --> 00:06:32,750
which you would have preferred,

134
00:06:32,751 --> 00:06:34,700
just got forgotten because it
was embarrassing and stupid,

135
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,230
then we say you're bad.

136
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,970
And so all you're left with is like the
most shameless people in the world who

137
00:06:40,971 --> 00:06:44,630
are in the public space,
right? The incentive structure
is to be deeply shameless,

138
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,710
to just say, yeah, man, I own that.
And it was great when I said it,

139
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,200
or I didn't say it at all. And
you're just, you're just full of it.

140
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:54,500
I never said that stuff. Oh, who are
you gonna believe your eyes are me?

141
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,930
And it makes,
it makes for a really bad politics.

142
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,720
Well, it's just this, uh, the culture of,

143
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:05,721
of going after people for things and
finding any thing to categorize them as

144
00:07:06,481 --> 00:07:10,740
someone who's a viable target. And this
is what I've seen. Thrust your way.

145
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,290
It's like there's nothing
wrong with being conservative.

146
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,710
There's something wrong with
wanting everyone to think
the way you think though.

147
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,540
This is the difference.
Like you,

148
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,590
why would I like that you do is you debate
your points, you state your positions,

149
00:07:22,591 --> 00:07:23,790
you have a philosophy.

150
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:28,410
And what I don't like is when people try
to pretend that that philosophy is some

151
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:33,330
somewhat somehow hateful or somehow
regressive or some like your,

152
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:37,800
that you condemn people for their
thoughts. You, you just, you don't,

153
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,380
this is what I,
not what I see with you.

154
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:39,561
Well,

155
00:07:39,561 --> 00:07:42,570
I appreciate that and I appreciate the
accuracy because I think that's true.

156
00:07:42,571 --> 00:07:45,510
I mean, I've come out against
virtually every Twitter band,

157
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,960
including people who have personally
targeted me. I've come out against that.

158
00:07:48,961 --> 00:07:50,470
I've come out against
virtually every yeah.

159
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:51,771
That because what do you,

160
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:56,010
what are your thoughts about this
idea of d platforming and you know,

161
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,520
this is something that we were just
discussing before the podcast, um,

162
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:03,880
where the CEO of Youtube and
it's Kara Swisher's from recode,

163
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,190
I think Kara Swisher.

164
00:08:05,191 --> 00:08:08,820
They were talking about removing you
from Youtube and I thought it was the CEO

165
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,510
of Youtube. It was Eric, actually.
Kara who said I would if I could.

166
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:15,270
Yeah, she tests because her son apparently
listens to. That's kind of funny. Yeah.

167
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,320
If she's being funny saying
it, but it was, it would,

168
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,690
I thought it was the CEO of you

169
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,430
to, she was trying to
get much more disturbing.

170
00:08:21,431 --> 00:08:24,360
I was trying to do the same thing that
they do with you or with Dave Rubin or

171
00:08:24,361 --> 00:08:25,081
Jordan Peterson,

172
00:08:25,081 --> 00:08:29,490
which is that anybody who
is sort of heterodox because
in that group I think I'm

173
00:08:29,491 --> 00:08:31,380
the only registered Republican ever.

174
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,340
Anybody who's Heterodox is now
being explored, trained as a docs,

175
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,450
meaning just thinks differently from kind
of the down the line Democratic Party

176
00:08:39,451 --> 00:08:41,800
platform. You're not like
down the line with Hillary.

177
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,710
Like Sam Harris is a democrat.

178
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,790
Sam Harris's Heterodox because he
disagrees that Islam is by necessity a

179
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:49,200
religion of peace, for example. Right?

180
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:53,700
Or he thinks that we have to look at
actual statistics in order to make

181
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,640
evidentiary based about
discrimination and disparity,

182
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,830
and this makes him an enemy of people
like as reclined@vox.com right.

183
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:05,190
Th this sort of stuff. They then say that
you are a feeder for white supremacy.

184
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,990
Right. They, they, they can't actually
get you on what you say. Yeah.

185
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:11,730
So it turns into, well, you know, some
members of your audience do things that,

186
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,580
that are really bad. It's like, well dude,

187
00:09:14,581 --> 00:09:16,890
I have like millions of people
who are members of my audience.

188
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:18,510
I have 5 million Facebook followers.

189
00:09:18,511 --> 00:09:20,610
I have 2 million on Twitter and
you're way bigger than I am.

190
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:23,520
I assume that some of those
people are going to be crazy.

191
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,700
I mean, yeah, I would assume.
Yeah. The idea that your respect,

192
00:09:26,701 --> 00:09:28,050
well this is what youtube tried to do.

193
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:31,080
You know about the comment thing where
the youtube was going to try to make

194
00:09:31,081 --> 00:09:33,480
people responsible for the
comments and their videos,

195
00:09:33,481 --> 00:09:37,950
which what is a normal Jamie?
Like a normal video that we get.

196
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,400
How many comments does it get?
I don't know, like 10,000.

197
00:09:41,401 --> 00:09:43,740
That's like an average one.
How the fuck

198
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,470
am I supposed to have some dude with
his itchy trigger finger standing by in

199
00:09:49,471 --> 00:09:52,320
front of a keyboard, just waiting
for something offensive to pop up.

200
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,620
And this was in response to something
that happened with them where there was

201
00:09:55,621 --> 00:09:59,700
pedophiles who are watching videos of
children doing things and they were

202
00:09:59,701 --> 00:10:01,140
commenting stuff in the,
you know,

203
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,330
like the children's gymnastics
and stuff like that.

204
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,900
They're commenting and like communicating
with each other through the comments.

205
00:10:06,901 --> 00:10:10,530
And it was sort of, um,
discovered that there was this,

206
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,170
this connection that they
were doing this and many,

207
00:10:13,171 --> 00:10:16,740
many videos and youtube rightly
panic. They're like, Holy Shit,

208
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,630
we have to stop this.
So the response,

209
00:10:18,631 --> 00:10:22,320
I guess was we just have to make
people responsible for their comments.

210
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:25,380
Someone said, oh yeah, good idea. I
didn't think through it at all. Right?

211
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,340
Certain people that
can't do that. Yes. It's

212
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:30,400
totally insane. And it's insane. And
in virtually every respect. And it's,

213
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,910
it's funny how it's only applied kind of
by the media on one side of the aisle.

214
00:10:33,911 --> 00:10:35,140
So to take an example,

215
00:10:35,141 --> 00:10:37,180
the congressional baseball shooting
happens a couple of years ago.

216
00:10:37,181 --> 00:10:40,480
Guy Happens to be a Bernie Fan, is that
Bernie Sanders is fault, right? No,

217
00:10:40,481 --> 00:10:43,210
that is not Bernie Sanders as
well, in a way. Right. Literally,

218
00:10:43,211 --> 00:10:46,780
people stopped talking about it and
that was shooting of legislators,

219
00:10:46,781 --> 00:10:49,870
like elected people. One nearly
died and that kind of went away.

220
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:52,210
We didn't talk about, you
know, Bernie's responsibility,

221
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:55,140
but there's a shooting in Christ church
and it's Jordan Peterson's fault. Yeah.

222
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,910
And Jordan Peterson has no relationship
with the shooter whatsoever.

223
00:10:57,911 --> 00:10:58,511
It's my fault.

224
00:10:58,511 --> 00:11:01,930
I have no relationship with the shooter
ended now to everything that that piece

225
00:11:01,931 --> 00:11:03,220
of crap stands for.
