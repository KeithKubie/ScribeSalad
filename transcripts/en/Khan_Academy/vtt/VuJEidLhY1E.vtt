00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.590
Everyone in the kingdom is very
impressed with your ability

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.380
to help with the party
planning, everyone

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.330
except for this gentlemen
right over here.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.140
This is Arbegla.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.840
And he is the
king's top adviser,

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.890
and also chief party planner.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.010
And he seems somewhat
threatened by your ability

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.752
to solve these otherwise
unsolvable problems,

00:00:20.752 --> 00:00:22.210
or at least from
his point of view,

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.740
because he keeps over-ordering
or under-ordering things

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.110
like cupcakes.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.150
And he says, king, that
cupcake problem was easy.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.870
Ask them about the
potato chip issue,

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.330
because we could never get
the potato chips right.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.820
And so the king says,
Arbegla, that's a good idea.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.520
We need to get the
potato chips right.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.420
So he comes to you
and says, how do we

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.119
figure out, on average, how many
potato chips we need to order?

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:45.660
And to do that, we
have to figure out

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.910
how much, on average,
does each man eat

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.670
and how much each woman eats.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.606
You say, well, what
about the children?

00:00:51.606 --> 00:00:52.980
The king says, in
our kingdom, we

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.560
forbid potato
chips for children.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.400
You say, oh, well,
that's all and good.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.070
Tell me what happened
at the previous parties.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.940
And so the king says, you might
remember, at the last party,

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.420
in fact, the last two
parties, we had 500 adults.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.725
At the last party, 200 of
them were men, and 300 of them

00:01:11.725 --> 00:01:12.225
were women.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.860
And in total, they ate
1,200 bags of potato chips.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.810
And you say, what about
the party before that?

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.140
He says, that one, we had a
bigger skew towards women.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.190
We only had 100 men,
and we have 400 women.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.870
And that time, we
actually had fewer bags

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:42.130
consumed-- 1,100
bags of potato chips.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.830
So you say, OK, king
and Arbegla, this

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.020
seems like a fairly
straightforward thing.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.300
Let me define some variables
to represent our unknowns.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.830
So you go ahead
and you say, well,

00:01:51.830 --> 00:02:06.559
let's let m equal the number
of bags eaten by each man.

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:08.100
And you could think
of it on average,

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.878
or maybe all the
men in that kingdom

00:02:09.878 --> 00:02:10.919
are completely identical.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:14.410
Or maybe it's the average number
of bags eaten by each man.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:25.620
And let's let w equal the number
of bags eaten by each woman.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.960
And so with these
definitions of our variables,

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.720
let's think about
how we can represent

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.810
this first piece of information,
this piece of information

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.940
in green.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.210
Well, let's think about
the total number of bags

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.600
that the men ate.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.020
You had 200 men.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.390
Let me scroll over a little bit.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.750
You had 200 men, and they each
ate m bags, m bags per man.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.715
So the men at this
first party collectively

00:02:52.715 --> 00:02:55.150
ate 200 times m bags.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.640
If m is 10 bags per man,
then this would be 2,000.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.110
If m was 5 bags per man,
then this would be 5,000.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.610
We don't know what m
is, but 200 times m

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.500
is the total eaten by the men.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.560
Same logic-- total
eaten by the women

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.570
is 300 women times the number
of bags eaten by each woman.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.160
And so if you add the total to
eaten by the men and the women,

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.200
you get the 1,200 bags.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.440
So this is information,
written algebraically,

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.150
given these variable
definitions.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.812
Now, let's do the same
thing with the second part

00:03:30.812 --> 00:03:33.020
of the information that they
gave us right over here.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.436
Let's think about how we can
represent this algebraically.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.160
Well, similar logic--
what was a total

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.070
that the men ate at that party?

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.850
It was 100 men times
m bags per man.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.710
And we're assuming that m
is the same across parties,

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.330
that men, on average, always
eat the same number of bags.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.820
And how many did the women
eat at that second party?

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.460
Well, you had 400 women.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.140
And on average, they
ate w bags per woman.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.550
So this is 400 times
w is the total number

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:03.620
that the women ate.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.850
You add those two together,
you get the total number

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.150
that all the adults ate.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.680
So this is going
to be 1,100 bags.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.530
So it looks pretty similar now.

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.190
You have a system of two
equations with two unknowns.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.430
And so you try your
best to solve it.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.680
But when you solve it, you
see something interesting.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.100
Last time, it was
very convenient.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.950
You had a, I think it was
a 500 here, for 500 adults,

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.170
and you had another 500.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.650
And so it seemed
like it was pretty

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.750
easy to cancel out
one of the variables.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.070
Here it seems a little
bit more difficult.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.660
What's multiplying by the
m's, it's different here.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.290
The coefficient on the w
is different over here.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.210
You say, well, maybe I can
change one of these equations

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.670
so it makes it a little
bit easier to cancel out

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.470
with the other equation.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:55.050
So what if, for example, I
were to take this blue equation

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.760
right over here and
multiply it by negative 2?

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.620
And you might say,
well, Sal, why are we

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.870
multiplying it by negative 2?

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.960
Well, if were to multiply
it by negative 2,

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.790
this 100m would become
a negative 200m.

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.190
And if it was a
negative 200m, then

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.710
that would cancel out
with a positive 200m

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.010
when we add the two.

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:15.180
So let's see what happens.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.920
So let's multiply this blue
equation by negative 2.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.000
We're going to
multiply by negative 2.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.870
Let me scroll over to
the left a little bit.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:24.536
So what happens?

00:05:24.536 --> 00:05:27.630
Remember, when we
multiply an equation,

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.380
we can't just do one
side of the equation.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.129
We have to do the
entire equation in order

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:33.060
for the equality to hold true.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.060
So negative 2 times
100m is negative 200m.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.660
Negative 2 times 400w-- there's
a positive right over there.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.810
So it becomes negative 800w.

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.370
And then negative 2-- now,
we did the left hand side,

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.360
but we also have to do
the right hand side.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:55.120
Negative 2 times 1,100
is negative 2,200.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.895
So just to be
clear, this equation

00:05:56.895 --> 00:05:58.470
that I just wrote
here essentially

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.680
has the same information
we just manipulated.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.400
We just changed this equation,
multiplied both sides

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.410
by negative 2.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.672
But it's kind of
the same constraint.

00:06:06.672 --> 00:06:08.130
But what makes this
interesting is,

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.690
now, we can rewrite
this green equation.

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.200
Let me do it over
here, this first one.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:20.835
200m plus 300w is
equal to 1,200.

00:06:20.835 --> 00:06:22.960
And the whole reason why
I multiplied by negative 2

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.090
is, so that if I were
to add these two things,

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.810
I might be able to get rid
of that variable over there.

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:28.862
And so let's do that.

00:06:28.862 --> 00:06:31.320
Let's add the left hand sides,
and let's add the right hand

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.880
sides.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.588
And you could literally
view it as, we're

00:06:33.588 --> 00:06:35.360
starting with this
blue equation.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.970
We're adding this
quantity, the left hand

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.770
side of the yellow equation to
the left hand side of the blue.

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.632
And then 1,200 is
the exact same thing

00:06:42.632 --> 00:06:44.340
that we're adding to
the right hand side.

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.270
We know that this
is equal to this.

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.740
So we can add this to the
left hand side and this

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.170
to the right hand side.

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:51.592
So let's see what happens.

00:06:51.592 --> 00:06:53.300
So the good thing is,
the whole reason we

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.300
multiplied it by negative
2, so that these two

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.336
characters cancel out.

00:06:56.336 --> 00:06:57.460
You add those two together.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.870
You just get 0m or just 0.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.990
You have negative
800w plus 300w.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.881
Well, that's negative 500w.

00:07:06.881 --> 00:07:08.380
And then on the
right hand side, you

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.140
have negative 2,200 plus 1,200.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:14.544
So that's negative 1,000.

00:07:14.544 --> 00:07:16.210
And now this is pretty
straightforward--

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.460
one equation, one unknown,
a fairly straightforward

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:19.230
equation.

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:22.920
We divide both sides by
the coefficient of w,

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:23.930
multiplying w.

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:28.570
So divide by negative 500 on
the left, divide by negative 500

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:29.500
on the right.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:34.750
And we are left with
w is equal to 2.

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:38.440
On average, women ate
two bags of potato chips

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.270
at these parties.

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:42.080
We're assuming that's
constant across the parties.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.280
So let's think about how
you would then figure out

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:48.810
how many bags, on
average, each man ate.

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:51.026
Well, to do that,
we just go back

00:07:51.026 --> 00:07:52.400
to either one of
these equations.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.850
In the last set of videos, I
went to the first equation.

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.200
I'll show that the second
equation should also work.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.660
Either one should work.

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.765
So let's substitute back
into the second equation.

00:08:01.765 --> 00:08:04.140
And you could either pick this
version of it or this one.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:05.850
But I'll pick the original one.

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:09.190
So you have 100
times m, which we're

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:12.400
trying to figure out,
plus 400 times-- well,

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:16.010
we now know that w is
equal to 2-- 400 times

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:21.610
2 is equal to 1,100.

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:28.950
So you have 100m plus
800 is equal to 1,100.

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:32.000
And now, to solve for
m, we could subtract 800

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:32.685
from both sides.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:43.890
And we are left with
100m is equal to 300.

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:49.690
And now, divide
both sides by 100.

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:53.490
And we are left with m, which
is, on average, the number

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:57.940
of bags of chips each
man eats is equal to 3.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.490
So you have solved
Arbegla's problem,

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:03.220
what he thought was a
difficult problem, using

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:06.000
the magical, mystical
powers of algebra.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.780
You were able to tell the king
in his party planning process

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:12.080
that, on average,
the men will eat

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.860
three bags of potato chips each.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:16.930
And on average,
the women will eat

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:20.510
two bags of potato chips each.
