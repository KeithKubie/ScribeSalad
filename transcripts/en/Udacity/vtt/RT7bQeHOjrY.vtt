Solomon Asch found that 76% of the people conformed with a group approximately

00:00:05.036 --> 00:00:10.317
37% of the time. So conformity is when people change their behavior to adjust

00:00:10.317 --> 00:00:14.056
to what others are doing. Or they change their behavior to adhere to cultural

00:00:14.056 --> 00:00:18.611
norms. And as we see, people go to great lengths to conform with others. And

00:00:18.611 --> 00:00:22.772
this often happens in decision making. And psychologists have a technical term

00:00:22.772 --> 00:00:26.531
for this and it's called group think. And group think can be dangerous because

00:00:26.531 --> 00:00:30.041
an individual may forego critical analysis or logic in attempts just to fit in

00:00:30.041 --> 00:00:35.652
with the group. For example, some psychologists and historians have suggested

00:00:35.652 --> 00:00:40.260
that Kennedy's behavior in the Bay of Pigs actually resulted from group think.
