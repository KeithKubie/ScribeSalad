00:00:01.468 --> 00:00:02.268
- Are these questions all
right for you, by the way?

00:00:02.268 --> 00:00:03.536
- They're perfect.

00:00:03.536 --> 00:00:04.337
- They're stupid, I
know they're stupid,

00:00:04.337 --> 00:00:05.572
but it's in the show.

00:00:05.572 --> 00:00:06.506
- I've been drinking
so much they starting

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:07.173
to start like smart questions.

00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:08.641
(laughing)

I voted for Hillary, even
though I don't look like it.

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:20.153
You gotta believe me.

00:00:20.153 --> 00:00:21.421
This is Stupid Questions.

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.391
All right, this is really dumb.

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:25.892
- Okay.

00:00:25.892 --> 00:00:26.893 line:0%
- Let's say me and you were
dating, which is possible.

00:00:26.893 --> 00:00:28.094
- That's the stupid part of it?

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:29.496 align:start size:84% position:16%
You got a thing with
big black women?

00:00:29.496 --> 00:00:30.730
- No, I don't, no I don't.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:31.998 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I don't know if I
wanna be here anymore.

00:00:31.998 --> 00:00:33.299
- I swear to God, I
don't have a thing.

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:34.267
- Why is that a part
of Stupid Questions?

00:00:34.267 --> 00:00:35.769
- All I'm saying is black women.

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:36.736 align:start size:97% position:3%
First of all I don't assume
gender, I like people--

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:38.304
- Oh now I'm not even a woman.

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:40.006
You don't assume that I'm
a woman, all this breast?

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:40.974
Come on.

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:42.709
- I know, I got big tits too.

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:44.411 align:start size:94% position:6%
- You always make it
about you Chris, I can't.

00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:45.645
- I'm sorry.

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:47.180 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
Would I get a second
date, would I get a se--

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.648 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
- You not even gettin' a first
date off this question, so.

00:00:48.648 --> 00:00:50.050 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
- A second date,
everything's the same,

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.118 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
I look how I look except
I have a ponytail.

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:54.187 line:0%
I turn like this you
notice, boom, ponytail.

00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:56.356 line:0%
Would you go on a
date number two?

00:00:56.356 --> 00:00:57.223
- No.

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:58.191
- You wouldn't?

00:00:58.191 --> 00:00:59.426
- Why would you have a ponytail?

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:00.894 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I don't know, what
about every time

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:02.796
I mention my mother
to you, I whisper it.

00:01:02.796 --> 00:01:04.697 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm like, you've
gotta meet my mother.

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:07.600 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Your breath
smells really good.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.702
If you whispered like that
in my nostrils, yeah, maybe.

00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:10.603
- Mother.

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:12.272
(upbeat music)

00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:14.941 align:start position:0% line:0%
- Would you rather have hiccups
for the rest of your life

00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:17.877 line:0%
or feel like you have to
sneeze but not be able to

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:20.013 line:0%
for the rest of your life?

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:22.382 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
- Or the third option,
I just kill myself.

00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:24.050 align:start size:84% position:16%
Don't nobody wanna
keep tryin' to pretend

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.085 align:start size:84% position:16%
like they gotta sneeze
and not sneezin',

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:26.252
not sneezin' and have--

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:27.654
- Can I be honest with you?

00:01:27.654 --> 00:01:29.889 align:start size:94% position:6%
There was a time recently,
like a month ago,

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:32.225
where I felt like I had to
sneeze for like two weeks

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:33.760
and I could not sneeze.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.562
I went to like three doctors,
I thought I had a brain tumor.

00:01:35.562 --> 00:01:37.063
How wild is that?

00:01:37.063 --> 00:01:38.431 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You gotta get outta
your environment.

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:40.233
(upbeat music)

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:42.268 align:start size:97% position:3%
- This next stupid question
is actually perfect.

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:43.803 line:0%
- Okay.

00:01:43.803 --> 00:01:44.971 line:0%
- What's the weirdest thing
I would see in your home?

00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:46.239 line:0%
- I have a cat fountain.

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:48.274 align:start size:81% position:19%
My cats, they need
fountain water.

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:49.375
They put the,

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:50.977
meow, meow, meow, meow.

00:01:50.977 --> 00:01:52.212
- That is pretty weird.

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:53.980
I'm allergic to cats,
is that a problem?

00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:56.549 align:start size:81% position:19%
Uh oh, did we just
change things?

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.051 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You're not allergic,
that's bullshit.

00:01:58.051 --> 00:01:59.452 align:start size:94% position:6%
Somebody told you you
were allergic, you're not.

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:00.653
Nobody's allergic to a cat.

00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:02.455 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I'm allergic to
cats and fake plants.

00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:03.790
- What about fake hair?

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.024 align:start size:72% position:28%
Yeah.
- Smells good.

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:06.793
- Yeah that's black
woman glory, yeah.

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:09.129 align:start size:97% position:3%
And a couple of bills.
- Now is it real or not real?

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:10.830 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You never ask a
woman about her hair.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.966
Where did you grow up?

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:14.434
Where did you grow up?

00:02:14.434 --> 00:02:16.669
Get your mother on the phone.

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:18.004
- The next stupid question.

00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:20.974
I'm gonna ask you this once.

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:22.242
(laughing)

00:02:22.242 --> 00:02:24.577 line:0%
- Which one of these
women is my mother?

00:02:24.577 --> 00:02:26.279 line:0%
- Stop!

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:27.814
Oh my God, well we know--

00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:29.015
- [Chris] I could be adopted.

00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:30.216 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Well we know
you're not adopted

00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:31.818 align:start size:81% position:19%
because nobody
would pick you up.

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:33.520
This is Bruno Mars' mom.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.454
(laughing)

00:02:34.454 --> 00:02:35.321
This is Nancy Reagan's mom.

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:36.789
- [Chris] Oh my God.

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:38.424 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I don't even know why
this lady's on a cell phone,

00:02:38.424 --> 00:02:41.494 align:start size:97% position:3%
she like she was born back
when they were usin' tin cans.

00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:42.328
(sighing)

00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:43.563
- Come on.

00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:45.031 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I think this is your
mom, young and hip.

00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:47.267
- Wow, that is not my mom.

00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:48.801
- [Yamaneika] Damn.

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:50.737
- But my mom is so happy
that you picked that lady.

00:02:50.737 --> 00:02:52.372
- This is actually my mom,

00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:54.774 align:start size:88% position:13%
just your classic human
resources manager.

00:02:54.774 --> 00:02:56.009
- Yes.

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:57.810 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Lovin' her dog, ya know.
- Yes.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
I was hopin' it wasn't her
because the worry her eyes say,

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.917
please don't bring
a black girl home.

00:03:03.917 --> 00:03:04.851
- Sorry Mom.

00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:05.985
- Guess who's comin' to dinner?

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:07.020
- Come on.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.854
(smooching)

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:09.322
(upbeat music)

00:03:09.322 --> 00:03:10.590
- Yamaneika, thanks so much

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.658
for playing Stupid
Questions with us.

00:03:11.658 --> 00:03:12.892
Did you have a good time?

00:03:12.892 --> 00:03:14.093 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I had an amazing time,
thanks for having me.

00:03:14.093 --> 00:03:14.928
- You know what?

00:03:14.928 --> 00:03:16.196
- What?

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:17.430
- Throughout this whole
night, I've been having

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.800 align:start size:88% position:13%
a caricature artist draw
out the entire scene.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.235
Just for no reason, I
just wanted to do it.

00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:23.203
And I wanna show it to you now,

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:24.571
it's like my goin' home present.

00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:25.672
I'm actin' like I'm not, yeah.

00:03:25.672 --> 00:03:26.606
Look at that.

00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:27.540
(gasping)

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.775
How unbelievable is that?

00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:30.210
That drew out the
whole scene for us.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.812
- I love this, this is me.

00:03:32.812 --> 00:03:33.613
She thinks I'm beautiful.

00:03:33.613 --> 00:03:34.714
- Oh that's your hair.

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:36.316 align:start size:88% position:13%
Oh she's got everything
in your hair.

00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:38.685
- What do you mean,
oh that's my hair?

00:03:38.685 --> 00:03:39.619
- This is your hair.

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:41.221
- What did you think this was?

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:42.255
- I don't know.

00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:43.790
(upbeat music)
