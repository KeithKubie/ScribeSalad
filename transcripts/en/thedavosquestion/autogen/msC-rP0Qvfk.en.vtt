00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.510
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:06.830
Arthur: This time last year Zimbabweans were
going into an election and those election

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.460
were inconclusive.
As a result Zimbabweans came together to discuss

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.969
the way forward.
As I speak this in [inaudible] Zimbabwe which

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:19.470
was rectified by our colleagues yesterday.
In hands we know have a conclusive and legitimate

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.080
government in Zimbabwe.
What we are calling upon the international

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:29.630
community to do is to respect this agreement.
To assist Zimbabweans as they try to cast

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.820
a way forward.
The inclusive governments that we are setting

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.690
up in Zimbabwe next week is the only way forward.
It is a short term measure to extricate our

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.210
country from its worst situation.
The agenda of this government has four elements.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.510
The first one is resolving the humanity crisis
in our country, food and cholera.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.610
The second area is national healing.
Our people were traumatized and brutalized

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.090
in June last year.
We need to heal our people in Zimbabwe.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.960
Number three, we need to recover and stabilize
our economy.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:09.230
And the last agenda of this government is
building and developing a new people democratic

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.650
constitution.
Going through referendum, there after, we

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.100
can have a free and fair election in Zimbabwe,
where there will be one winner who can then

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.600
form a proper government.
This is what we intend to do.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:32.060
We need the international community, we need
regional leaders, we need the African union

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.090
to support this arrangement where Zimbabweans
have agreed to work amongst themselves to

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.760
salvage their country.
This is not about partisan interests this

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.062
is not about personal interests, it is about
the national interest in Zimbabwe.

00:01:45.062 --> 00:01:48.560
It is about the people of Zimbabwe who are
dying.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:55.740
We have come together in Zimbabwe because
we realize we need to be flexible, pragmatic

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.760
and reflective of the interests of the people
of Zimbabwe.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.730
So yes we've had our reservations about that,
but that stops right here.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:11.310
We must serve our people and absolve this
current [inaudible] if we don't do the right

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.129
thing and serve our country.
