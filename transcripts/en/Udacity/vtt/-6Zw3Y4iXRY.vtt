00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:02.960
All right, why don't we walk through the solution.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.700
First we define these Python lists called countries, gold, silver, and

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.850
bronze, which give us ordered lists of the country names, gold medal counts,

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.040
silver medal counts, and

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.420
bronze medal counts as they appear in the Sochi medal count table.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.550
Then we create this Python dictionary, Olympic medal counts.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.630
Where the keys are our column names and

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.770
the values are panda series containing these lists.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.271
Finally, we create our data frame Olympic_medal_counts_df by

00:00:31.271 --> 00:00:34.240
passing olympic_medal_counts into the DataFrame function.
