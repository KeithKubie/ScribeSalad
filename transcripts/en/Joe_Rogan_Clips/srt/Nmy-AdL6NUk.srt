1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,300
It's that moment of getting people to
see everyone involved as human, right?

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:08,510
We're not there yet. Still the ways
people are talking about addiction are,

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:09,723
oh,

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,980
repellent, right? This is the thing of
people as being weak. I think of people's,

5
00:00:15,981 --> 00:00:19,680
uh, having poor willpower, poor character,
and that's why they're addicted.

6
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:24,690
They're most people. I would, I
would say it's safe to venture,

7
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,230
aren't really fully
aware of what the causes,

8
00:00:28,231 --> 00:00:31,320
what the underlying causes of people
becoming addicted to drugs in the first

9
00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:34,500
place are. And what, what leads people
this great sense of despair. I mean,

10
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:38,880
it's really about reengineering our
entire culture. I mean, re-engineering,

11
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,470
not just the way we treat addiction,

12
00:00:40,471 --> 00:00:43,230
but the way we treat human beings
where we treat poor neighborhoods.

13
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:44,663
I mean there's,

14
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,360
there's so much that needs to be done
that's never dressed totally right.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,833
And

16
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:53,130
there's one part of this,

17
00:00:53,131 --> 00:00:58,131
this a funny really when they surprises
me in this debate I have found is

18
00:00:58,531 --> 00:01:03,531
actually easier in the u s to make the
case for compassion for people with

19
00:01:03,721 --> 00:01:07,950
addiction problems than to make the case
for liberty for drug users who are not

20
00:01:07,951 --> 00:01:11,220
addicted. Right? So, like we
were saying, even the main
drug, your body in the world,

21
00:01:11,221 --> 00:01:12,270
the UN ODC,

22
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,230
you're an office of drug control admits
90% of all currently banned drug uses.

23
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,540
What's called non problematic,
right? Our friend,

24
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:21,730
Professor Carl Hart is the head of
Psychology at Columbia University in an

25
00:01:21,731 --> 00:01:25,590
extraordinary human being has done
really important work explaining this to

26
00:01:25,591 --> 00:01:30,360
people, even with what we think of
as the devil drugs like heroin crack.

27
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:34,080
The vast majority of people who use
heroin and crack do not become addicted.

28
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,220
Right. Which I found really chat when Carl
first explained that to me. I was like,

29
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,510
what's this guy talking about?

30
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:42,150
And then they looked at the scientific
evidence that there is very clear

31
00:01:42,151 --> 00:01:44,460
evidence. Right? Um, the, the actually,

32
00:01:44,461 --> 00:01:49,461
the ratio of people who use any drug who
become addicted is pretty consistently

33
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:52,710
10 to 20%. Right? Slightly
higher for things like heroin,

34
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,380
but it's pretty consistently in that zone.
Right?

35
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,680
Which is not to say that
there aren't other hoe. Heroin
depresses your breathing.

36
00:01:58,681 --> 00:02:01,650
It can cause death that way. There other
harms, but we're talking about addiction.

37
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,020
Right? Um, so

38
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,800
it's interesting. There's so much. I
think we need to explain to people.

39
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,320
One person here in la who really helped
me to understand this and the reset for

40
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,530
the, because guy called Professor
Ronald k Siegel, you should,

41
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,750
you should totally have in your
shows is a very interesting guy.

42
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,910
So he was an advisor to four
American presidents. He was, uh,

43
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,390
wh advisor to World Health Organization.
Really serious scientist,

44
00:02:24,391 --> 00:02:28,950
but he had a sideline for 30 years. We
investigated animals using drugs, right?

45
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,350
And he's basically shown loads of
species love getting intoxicated for the

46
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:36,150
pleasure of it, right? Sure. Elephants,

47
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,110
elephants like this amazing example of
I've in Golub elephants who broke into an

48
00:02:40,111 --> 00:02:42,880
alcohol store, got really drunk and
just fucked up the whole village. Right?

49
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,240
There's a bit of a great example.
You gave what you give,

50
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:50,100
if you give hashed to mice, what they
do is they'll, they get really horny.

51
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,680
They try to male, nice.
We'll try to mount women,

52
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,780
but then they basically can't get it up.

53
00:02:54,781 --> 00:02:57,620
So they just spend hours looking their
own balls and they're going to cock, uh,

54
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,660
Saturday loads of examples.
It's a pretty guy. Pressy. Got,

55
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:05,470
I remember he told me at one point that
he'd spent three years investigating,

56
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,633
um,

57
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:12,510
grasshoppers in cannabis fields who just
naturally live in cannabis fields to

58
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:16,330
figure out when they eat the cannabis,
do they jump higher or lower? And I said,

59
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:18,520
I write and at the end of your
three years, what did you discover?

60
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:21,020
And he said they'd turns out they just
dumped the same height as everyone all

61
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,120
the other girls offers.
So it's not really,

62
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:25,050
that wasn't a great use of your three
years of life. But he also got the,

63
00:03:25,051 --> 00:03:26,860
had an interesting time
when he was in Hawaii,

64
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:31,861
he was investigating Mangu where the
mongoose is like hallucinogen psychedelics

65
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,730
and he, so he's like spying
on these mongooses with,

66
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:40,780
with we've been oculus and it gets caught
and it gets caught by a loaded drug

67
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:44,410
traffickers and they're like, who the
fuck are you? And he's like, don't worry,

68
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,990
I'm just investigating whether
Mongoose is like psychedelics.

69
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:49,690
Like that is the worst fucking cupboard
story we've ever had that held them

70
00:03:49,691 --> 00:03:50,620
hostage for like two days.

71
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,190
But he showed us something I think is
really important and there's loads of

72
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:56,170
other evidence sport, which is, um,

73
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:01,900
it is absolutely a Nate to other species,
especially to humans.

74
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,260
The desire to get intoxicated,
right.

75
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,480
There has never been a human society
anywhere in the world where people didn't

76
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:09,700
seek out and toxicants
and enjoy using them.

77
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,910
The only society where there are no
naturally occurring in toxicants was the

78
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,260
anyway,

79
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,350
the what we used to be called the Eskimos
and the architect and they used to

80
00:04:17,351 --> 00:04:21,310
just starve themselves to get a fucked
up head state because that's how deep it

81
00:04:21,311 --> 00:04:23,590
is in human beings. If there
is nothing in there. Yeah.

82
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,210
If you starve yourself long enough,

83
00:04:25,211 --> 00:04:28,150
you get a kind of fucked up
head state basically. How far,

84
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,300
how long are you going to go for? I don't
know. I looked into the details of it,

85
00:04:31,301 --> 00:04:35,770
but he writes about that. Um,
but, but so it's fasting. Yeah.

86
00:04:35,771 --> 00:04:40,650
Fast and courses and all to Ted State. But
that, I've never done it, but that, this,

87
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:44,350
this, this intoxication
imposters is deepen human
beings. As the sexual impasse,

88
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,870
you even see it in small children.
You know, when a little kid,

89
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:49,090
everyone will remember this memory of
when you're a little kid and you realize

90
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,420
you can spin round and round and round
even though you know it'll make you sick,

91
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:54,220
you'd do it cause you
get an altered headspace.

92
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:59,410
That is one of the first expressions of
the kind of intoxication impulse. Um,

93
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:03,380
or a really nice example
is for 2000 years, uh,

94
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:07,920
40 miles outside of Athens in
ancient Greece, they used to be, um,

95
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,380
once a year people
would meet at something,

96
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:14,380
a place called the temple of Hallucis
and it was basically burning man.

97
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,390
They would all use a psychedelic together.

98
00:05:16,391 --> 00:05:19,360
We now know what that like Docker's yeah,
it was a kind of,

99
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,820
there's lots of different theories
but they think it was a kind of fungus

100
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:25,920
basically. Um, I remember the name
of it, but there's been research,

101
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:29,960
Liz and Simon or something. Is that, I
don't know, I want to say it wrong. I,

102
00:05:29,961 --> 00:05:32,800
there was some kind of stuff I kind of
psychedelic mushrooms and like people

103
00:05:32,801 --> 00:05:37,000
like Plato and Eris. Sometimes people
say no drugs or William Bennett,

104
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:40,660
the former drugs are saying drugs are
an attack on the foundations of Western

105
00:05:40,661 --> 00:05:41,710
civilization. And you're like, no.

106
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,980
At the actual foundations
of Western civilization,

107
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,780
the people your holding up as the icons,

108
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:50,200
like Plato and Aristotle were literally
getting fucked up in exactly the way you

109
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:53,020
say is an attack on them. Right?
It's this deep misunderstanding.

110
00:05:53,021 --> 00:05:56,920
So this is a natural human impulse.
We are never going to get rid of it.

111
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,390
We want to get rid of it.
It gives people a lot of joy and pleasure.

112
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:04,010
And yet the Oscar Wilde said once,
I'm going to get the quote slightly wrong,

113
00:06:04,011 --> 00:06:05,120
you said it better than this,
but you said,

114
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:10,420
puritanism is the deepening fear that
someone somewhere is enjoying themselves.

115
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:16,590
And there's this puritanical
hatred of, of drug use, right? Um,

116
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:20,460
now some of that is understandable
fears, Matt genuine harms. Uh,

117
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:24,080
and that's a different thing.
But a lot of it is just very deep.

118
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:24,840
Puritanism and yeah.
