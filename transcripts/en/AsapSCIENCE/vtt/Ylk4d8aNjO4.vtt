00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I think I'm nervous to find out I'm like not who I think I am.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.420
I'm expecting to learn about kind of what I am.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.280
Today we're doing a 23andMe test to find out if we actually are who we think we are.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.000
We've been wanting to do this for a long time now,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.240
We've actually spat into the vial and submitted the stuff to 23andMe a long time ago

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.880
before they reached out to even sponsor this video.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.340
My family's like really mixed.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.260
My dad's white.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.220
But then my mom is born in India but also of like Welsh descent, I think

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.520
Sometimes I just call myself a mutt.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.160
Don't know much about my ancestry.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.340
I know that I went to Scotland once and my dad was like, "get our family tartan,"

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.680
and I was like, "we're Scottish?"

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.680
The name "23andMe" come from the fact that human DNA is organized into 23 pairs of chromosomes.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.400
Their DNA analysis was created to help you understand your own DNA

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.360
and find out which parts of the world your ancestors are from, about your health, your physical traits and more.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.260
The first thing we have to do is collect our spit so that we can mail it to 23andMe.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.240
Whoaaa.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.460
The process requires collecting two milliliters of your own saliva

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.780
and that means that 23andMe, which has over one million participants, as a company has collected over two thousand liters of saliva

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.560
which is disgusting but also kind of awesome.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.280
[music]

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.800
We're gonna do Greg's results

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.360
right now.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.840
Whoa!! [laughter] I am 99.99% European.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.780
[laughter]

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.440
M: French and German.
G: 2.8% French and German

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.420
Why do they group those together?

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.280
I'm 1.4% Scandinavian. This is not shocking to me at all.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.220
So you're white.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.720
Full British.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.900
You most likely had a fourth great-grandparent who is 100% Yakut.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.340
G: What's Yakut?
M: That's cool.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.320
Siberian.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.560
Okay, so I'm like.. 99.9% British, 0.1% Siberian.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:44.660
I'm gonna get a Siberian husky off of that one Yakut person who made it into my lineage in 1732.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.060
Yours is lit up all around the globe, my friend.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.720
Whoa. And there's India in there! Okay good, I haven't been lying to everyone

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.340
So I still am quite European.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.000
Of which 32% is British.. 5.3% Chinese.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.260
You have a bit of Korean!

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.000
That's my like Korean [incomprehensible]

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.500
[laughter]

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.320
I'm not sure if it's right to be so excited about like having like... a percentage point Korean in me

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.260
it's just cause I love Korean food and culture so much.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.140
It feels really cool to have a little more of a definitive answer of my background.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.040
I have 290 Neanderthal variants.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.780
You look like a Neanderthal to me

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.800
Oh my god thank you, they're so big and beastly.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.060
This is more than 69% of 23andMe customers.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.500
Oh wow. So a lot of me is Neanderthal

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.000
M: Not surprising.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.180
That explains a lot. I'm dirty.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.340
I'll take it.
M: Like, that's maybe where your like pain resistance comes from.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.680
M: Wow.
G: That is so not information I want you to have.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.940
Look at it, look at your little  [incomprehensible] jaw. [laughter]

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.500
Genetic information is pulled from our DNA using SNPs, which are relatively common variations in DNA-based pairs.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:58.340
The saliva is broken into fragments and laid over a SNPchip, or a credit card-sized plate covered in DNA probes.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:05.260
Analyzing these chips gives light into your ancestral background, as well as fun questions like "can you smell asparagus in your urine?"

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.740
or, "are you prone to male patterned baldness?"

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.320
M: Lighter skin... whoa.
G: You are like even lighter skinned.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.820
M: Oh, but it is light beige.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.140
G: You're mostly light beige.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.160
M: And then, have some olive in there.
G: And then moderately fair, and then very fair then olive.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.700
G: Wow. So your skin is fair, hence the burning, hence you need to wear sunscreen.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.180
G: You are very susceptible to Mitch's farts.
M: What?!

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.640
Weirdly specific.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.380
M: You can smell asparagus in pee.
G: Yeah, I can smell asparagus for sure. And I didn't even know people couldn't smell asparagus.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.200
I always used to think it was that some people had smelly asparagus pee but it's like, just based on who can smell it.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.480
G: Yeah, yeah. 
M: Everyone has it.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.460
It says I'm likely a sprinter/power muscle type YEAH.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.800
I used to run and sprint when I was a kid, but... like, not anymore.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.040
I think everyone did too though. [laughter]

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.800
Well I have like, bad knees, bad back, like...

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.380
G: You're sprinter/power muscle type too, bro!

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.380
Oh my god, stop.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.260
I'm not a sprinter.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.280
It's, you know, perhaps a path I... I never took.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.160
This is bull. I'm callin' bullshit on this.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.660
M: Oh yeah.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.580
Alcohol flush reaction: unlikely to flush.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.700
Okay, so that is not true. I drink, I literally turn purple. That's just not the case for me.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.520
It's not cool when you're partying with your friends to be turning purple and everyone be like, "are you okay?" and you're like, "I'm just trying to have fun."

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.980
You know, sometimes you feel like an impostor in your own body when you're a bit of like a mixed child.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.120
You kind of don't know like where to belong and... but, knowing that that is truth now

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.860
I'm like, "oh, I don't have to like belong to one specific ethnicity."

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:35.320
That excites me. I love traveling, I love being engaged with other cultures and ethnicities so I feel like it's just an excuse to do that more.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.900
And be like, "oh, it's in my blood! Like I need to go experience all these other things now."

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.620
We want to thank 23andMe for sponsoring this episode.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:49.440
If you'd like to get your own kit, you can head to 23andMe.com/Asap. We'll put the links in the description and you'll be helping to support our show as well.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:55.260
So we had so much fun doing this. You can do it too, you can find out about your ancestry but also your wellness and health.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.360
We're about to leave and go look at ours really detailed.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.040
Thanks again for watching, make sure you subscribe for more episodes of the Lab and we will see you next time.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.540
Peace.
