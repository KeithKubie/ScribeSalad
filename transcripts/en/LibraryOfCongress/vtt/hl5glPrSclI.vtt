00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.810
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: Welcome.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.490
OK. It's OK, great.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.330
So I'm Pam Jackson.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.190
I'm director for the
Center for the Book here

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:33.700
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.290
And we are part of the new National

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.920
and International Outreach
unit that's been created.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.590
We welcome you here tonight.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.560
I just want to mention a little
bit about the Library of Congress

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.960
and then I'll introduce our-- the
individuals that will be part--

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.550
the next individual who'll be
participating in our program.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.190
And I feel I'm too
close to the microphone.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.860
So a part of our vision
here at the Library is

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.900
that we are the chief steward of
the record of knowledge for America

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.740
and world, thus creating a
springboard to the future.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.110
And the future I hope to see is one
of compassion and courage, industry

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.190
and innovation, remarkable
accomplishment, achievement,

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.840
one of peace and harmony.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.570
Some of which is discussed in
the poems that we'll be hearing--

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.660
perhaps we'll be hearing
from tonight.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.910
A part of the Library's
central mission is

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.190
to provide the American people with
rich diverse and enduring source

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:49.440 position:56%
of knowledge that can be relied
upon to inform, inspire, and engage,

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.620
and to support intellectual
and creative endeavors.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.680
And tonight, we have an opportunity

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.580
to enjoy a very special
creative endeavor

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.270
with the spotlight
on native writers.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.190
This evening's event is sponsored
with the Library's Asian division

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.070
and the Poetry and
Literature Center.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.030 position:56%
And to find out more about both, we
do invite you to visit us on the web

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:22.430
at loc.gov/rr/asian for Asian
division and www.loc.gov/poetry.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.250
Today's third annual event,
we've held in conjunction

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.830
with literary magazine
Manoa, a Pacific journal

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.720
of international writing
launched in 1989.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.810
Manoa brings the literature of
Asia, the Pacific, and the Americas

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.500
to English-speaking readers.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.720
To date, the journal has
published over 50 volumes

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.140
of about 10,000 pages and over 1200
writers, translators, reviewers,

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.680
and editors have participated
in those publications.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.510
To find out more-- yup.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.300
[ Applause ]

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.120
To find out more about that
journal, please visit their website

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.480
at manoajournal.hawaii.edu.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.500
And I'd like to give a special
thanks to Manoa series editor,

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.850 position:56%
Frank Stewart, for his tireless
efforts to bring world class writers

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.140
and writing to the
Library of Congress.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.350
With Frank's help, we have
focused on the literature

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.320
of Okinawa and Singapore.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.010
And tonight we turn to Korea.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.950
We could not have a better
duo of literary exemplars

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.900
than Ko Un and Brother Anthony.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.420
And on behalf of the Center
for the Book and the Poetry

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.630
and Literature Center, I
want to thank both of you

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.950
for traveling halfway around
the world to be here tonight.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.510
Thank you so much.

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:02.060
[ Applause ]

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.330
A quick word about our event,
for the opening hour or so,

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.280
Ko Un will read his poems

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.790
and Brother Anthony will
provide translations.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.200
Afterwards, Frank Stewart will
lead a short moderated discussion.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.660 position:56%
Before we do begin, though, I'd like
to ask you to check that your phones

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.670
and devices, tablets
are turned to silent

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.130
so that they may not interfere
with the recording of the program.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.650
And then I'll turn
to the next person

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.920
in our agenda Helena Zinkham will
explain how tonight's program

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.220
highlights the activities

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.540
of the Library's Collections
and Services division.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.120
And a little bit about Helena.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.990 position:56%
She is the director for Collections
and Services and the chief of Prints

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.400
and Photographs Division
for the Library of Congress.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.420
And where-- we have 15 million
images available for research

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:02.340
with more than 1 million
online at www.loc.gov/pictures.

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.700
And I have to mention this.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.300
Helena fell in love with
pictures while she was working

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.110
at the Maryland Historical Society,

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.970
which was some number
of years before.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.170
She's been at the Library
for quite awhile and is one

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:18.960
of our most premier experts
and personally she is a friend,

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.350
one of the most beautiful
people I know here

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:26.450
in the Library who's also an
extraordinary scholar and expert.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.510
Please welcome her, Helena Zinkham.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:37.150
[ Applause ]

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.450
&gt;&gt; Helena Zinkham: Hello everyone.

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:40.070
Can you hear well enough?

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.720
All right.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.440
As the Library's director
for Collections and Services,

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.820
I'd like to offer you a quick
profile of our treasured holdings

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.590
and our world renowned
research guidance.

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:57.350 position:56%
Founded in 1800, so that makes what?

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.620
216 years old and going strong.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.960
We're the oldest federal cultural
institution in the United States.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.260
And I think that's quite an
honor for a library, right.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.040
It shows the value of our whole
country for knowledge and learning.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.130
Not something that's obvious
everyday in our newspapers.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:20.340 position:56%
But tonight we're here to celebrate
the long, long traditions of culture

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:25.690
that the world has known
and created inspiration.

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.380
Despite our name, which of
course, includes the word Congress

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.170
and that is our primary
service point.

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:34.320
I would hope you come away from
this evening thinking of us

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.750
as America's Library, the National
Library of the United States.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:46.440
We're the stewards for an
estimated 160 million items,

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.890
more than 450 languages.

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:54.120
Do you every thought about
that before, more than 450?

00:06:54.120 --> 00:07:01.440
Well, of course, there are a lot of
printed books, around 24 million,

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.500
but also electronic
databases, manuscripts

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.500
and mass movies and music.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.830
Pam mentioned the wonderful
photographs,

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.700
but also sound recordings.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.130
How many miles of shelving
do you think that all takes?

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:17.180
I had to look it up.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.000
But it turned out to be 848.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.880
I think we could drive back and
forth to New York City many times

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.650
if we lined all the books
up along the highway.

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:32.950
Last year, we responded to almost
half a million reference requests

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:37.390
and we recorded almost 80
million visits to our website.

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:41.870
You heard Pam mentioned many URL
or web addresses, and that's,

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:45.470
of course, because many people are
not as fortunate as this evening

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:47.910
where you can come in
person to the Library

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:50.230 position:56%
and hear the wonderful presentation.

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:53.970
So actually an awful a lot
of our services now online,

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:56.630
outreaching to the whole world.

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:58.540
You don't have to be
an American citizen.

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:00.800
You don't even have to
live in the United States.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.700
We'll try to answer your questions.

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:07.620
The statistics might impress you
with our size and we are known

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.190 position:56%
as the largest library in the world.

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:15.050
But what really matters, of
course, is content and quality.

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:17.770
We're fortunate enough to
have many unites filled

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.140
with subject matter experts.

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:24.150
And they provide reference
guidance and also insides

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:26.060
into these massive collections.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:28.400
So don't let scale slow you down.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.700
There are actually people
here, a human interface as well

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:37.090
as an electronic ready to answer
questions, or spark new ideas even

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:39.530
if you don't answer--
ask the question.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:40.830
We'll check in.

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:42.700
Is there something you'd
like to know about?

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.710
A particular interest
this evening, of course,

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:48.840
are the international study areas,

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.540
which focus on specific
regions of the world.

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:56.300
We have four, European,
Hispanic, African, Middle East,

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:59.690
and the topic this
evening, Asian division.

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:02.220
The Asian division is a
prime example of the kind

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:05.410
of specialization that
emphasizes works written

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:07.900
in the vernacular languages.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:12.070
For the case of Asian division that
includes China, of course, Japan,

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:16.280
India, Southeast Asia, and Korea.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.740
Let's take a closer look
at the Korean collections.

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:21.810
And I hope if you don't
already have the handout,

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:23.140
it's out by the display.

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:25.930
Please be sure to pick
up a copy this evening.

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:30.270
The Korean collections
are known as the largest

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:34.240
but as importantly the most
comprehensive assemblage

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:38.360
of Korean language materials
outside of East Asia.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.480
While the holdings do consist
primarily of works from 20th

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.070
and 21st centuries, a number

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:48.050
of important pre-19th century
publications are included.

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:50.460
And it really tickles
me that we express it

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:52.940
that way before the 1800s.

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:59.090
Well, let's try publications
from 1421 that were made

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:04.320
with movable type before Gutenberg
printed his bible in Europe,

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.410
so a fabulous collection.

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:09.670
As of today, a few more numbers,

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:13.460
303,000 books in the
Korean collection,

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:17.820
more than 7600 periodical
or magazine titles

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:20.430
and that includes everything
from the major magazines

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:25.030
to government reports in the
scholarly or academic journals.

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:29.140
In addition, our Korean team has
assembled more than 2500 reels

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:35.580
of microfilm so that you can have
access to 250 different newspapers.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.760
Some of these numbers
still just blow me away.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:44.050
One country Korea, 250 different
newspapers and all those opinions

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:49.610
and perspectives can be seen
here in the Library of Congress.

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:53.900
And the microfilm is going
back as far as the 1920s

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:55.670
with those newspapers and so

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:58.710
of course representing
the Korean Diaspora.

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:00.700 position:56%
In terms of subject matter coverage,

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:05.320 position:56%
the Korean collection compromise has
many topics, history, literature,

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:08.960
economy, technology,
religion, and the arts.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.360
And we're also beginning to
get more digitized content out.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.040
So through the world
digital library,

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:19.080
we began to put some Korean
books out on to the internet.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:22.240
[Inaudible] tonight's presentation,
however, I'm pleased to point

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.660
out that the Library of Congress
has a significant collection

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:29.770
of publications by our
esteemed and it turns

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:33.690
out quite prolific speaker, Ko Un.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.100
Would like to estimate?

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:42.600
247. I should have said
into the microphone.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:48.580
But it's worth repeating
anyway, 247 works here

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:50.550
in the Library of Congress.

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:52.510
I think that's astonishing.

00:11:52.510 --> 00:12:00.380
[ Applause ]

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:03.800
Specialist from the Asian division
have organized a sample display,

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:07.340
tip of the iceberg, but aren't
the covers of the books beautiful?

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:10.940
And I understood, you made
some of the paintings yourself.

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:12.460
Just lovely.

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:15.540
So we are honored this
evening to have Ko Un as well

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:18.000
as Brother Anthony with today.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.370
They're the living embodiment
of that rich, diverse,

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:24.820
and enduring source of
knowledge that Pam spoke of

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.620
and that we seek to provide.

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:29.630
The poetry you will hear
tonight will surely inform,

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:30.930
inspire, and engage.

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:33.190
We can't say that too often.

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:37.820
Libraries are so often thought
of as factual, nonfiction,

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:39.320
the truth, the whole truth.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.760
But the reality is,
we love literature.

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.470
We adore poetry.

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:48.420
Rob Casper is here this evening,
many others from the Poetry Center.

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:51.520
The creative imaginative
side of life is just

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.360
as important for our future.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.160
Thank you.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:13:03.410

&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: I
think-- Oh, take it away.

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:09.200
&gt;&gt; Brother Anthony: I
think I have to start.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:15.010
I have to start by saying my
voice is in an unstable condition.

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:16.820
We'll see how it goes.

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:22.710
My name is Brother Anthony and
with Ko Un and then with Frank,

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:26.100
we are going to have
this reading with you.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.770 position:56%
And I don't want to spend much time.

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:32.020
There's lots to be done.

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:37.500
It's impossible to rarely introduce
a poet who has published something

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:45.500
like 155 books and who is now
in his 84th year in a few words.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:49.710
When you go out, you will find
a handout, a printed text,

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:55.720
two pages summarizing the story
of his life and his poetic career,

00:13:55.720 --> 00:14:00.040
which I prepared and also
a guide to publications

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:03.010
in English and homepages and so on.

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:08.950
So you can look at that at
leisure to learn about Ko Un.

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:13.470
At the start of this reading,
also, I have asked Frank Stewart,

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:18.140
the general editor of Manoa to
read the first section of poems.

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:21.800
The poems which were
published in the recent edition

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:27.930
of Manoa dedicated to Korean
poetry which I helped guest edit.

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:31.070
Copies are outside.

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:33.940
So seem [inaudible] the
English of these poems.

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:40.410
So before anything else,
see, Ko Un has lived

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:44.990
through the Japanese colonial
period, then the departure

00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:47.970
of Japanese followed
by the Korean War.

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:51.080
Korean War followed by
the modernizing period,

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:57.150
which was dominated by regimes
of dictatorship involved

00:14:57.150 --> 00:15:00.470
in the whole struggle
for democratization

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:03.180
and for basic human rights.

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:08.500
But he has always been from the
very start essentially a poet.

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:12.080
And so this evening we're going
to be listening to poetry.

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:18.440
And now to start the event, Ko
Un is going to say a few words.

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:22.970
And I will translate.

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:35.530
&gt;&gt; Ko Un: Good evening.

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:38.510

&gt;&gt; Brother Anthony: In Persia, poets
are venerated as gods or saints.

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:23.360
Hafez, [inaudible], and Rumi
are that kind of divine poet.

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:32.510
In the United States or Korea,
a poet is simply a poet.

[ Foreign Language ]

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:06.450
The American poet, Walt Whitman
embodies the American spirit

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:09.930
to such an extent that
he's regarded as one

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:14.100
of the founding fathers
in terms of spirit.

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:18.480
Hermann Hesse once praised
Whitman as the first American poet.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:22.260
I think a great poet like him
is one of the grandfathers

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.910
of poetry irrespective
of nationality.

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:37.950
"Leaves of Grass" is the
only collection Whitman left,

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:42.510
while I who belong to a much later
generation have written many poems,

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:46.010
probably my poet career
is in succession

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:50.160
to the ancient epic
tradition of Central Asia.

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:56.130
"Manimbo", a series of character
poems contains 4001 poems

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:58.190
in 30 volumes.

00:18:58.190 --> 00:18:59.580
While the seven-volume epic

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:04.290
"Paektu san" might take seven
days to read completely.

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:07.060
But I've come here
across the Pacific working

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:12.050
on another lengthy epic
for the past 10 years.

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:16.570
But [inaudible] these
very long poems,

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:20.950
I also write very short
poems, many breathless poems,

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:23.280
only have one or two lines.

In my poetry reading today,
in this great whole of books,

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:47.190
I would like to meet each one of
you through a few of my poems.

Let me express my gratitude
in advance.

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:37.440
I want to thank especially Robert
Casper, the head of the Poetry

and Literature Center of the Library
of Congress, and also Frank Stewart,

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:45.920

all his efforts.

who's come here this evening

I don't have so much curiosity
about the Capitol itself,

about all the provisions

of the planet contained
in the precious volumes

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:38.510
So I hope that my poems

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:45.510
through tonight will accompany
the souls of all those books.

come from the volume untitled poems

some 1000 pages thick enough

Three years ago, I lived in
Venice for four months invited

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.120
by a university there and most
of the poems emerge explosively

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:13.500
at some moments during our time.

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:17.110
I termed it a meteor
shower of poetry.

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:19.300
Ten of the poems were included

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:21.930
in the Manoa volume,
"The Colors of Dawn".

several of singing together,

comforting each other, consoling

together, a song like lamenting,

in some distant village
wake up with and listen

to with closed eyes while
waiting for a new sleep to come.

My song was a mourning.

01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:52.510
My song was someone's resurrection.

01:06:52.510 --> 01:06:59.260
And my song was a song of
extinction not immortality.

gathered and so jubilant,

wrinkles and just two yellow teeth.

He laughed like a fool
and said only one thing.

01:18:52.950 --> 01:18:59.500
After the revolution early last
century the Soviet poets decided

01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:01.560
they would only say "We."

01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:06.760
They decided they would
only call themselves "We."

01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:08.340
They were enchanted.

Their decision held even when they
could not go out into the streets,

01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:19.560
even when they lingered
indoors due to heavy blizzards.

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:24.000
They took oaths saying
"We", by themselves.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.370
"I" had disappeared somewhere
deep in the looking-glass.

01:19:28.370 --> 01:19:30.610
Mayakovsky, too, one
bright sunny day,

01:19:30.610 --> 01:19:33.800
dashed out shouting
and shouting "We."

01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:36.050
He was a poet of the street.

01:19:36.050 --> 01:19:38.610
"I" was not allowed anywhere.

01:19:38.610 --> 01:19:40.680
"I" was wicked.

"We We" that alone
had incantatory power.

low-pressure front settled in.

Summer flowers kept being trampled.

And likewise the tall, round
atmosphere of "We" slowly went flat.

am in love," but still

01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:21.600

read as "We are in love."

Late last century the
Soviet Union disappeared.

Warsaw Pact one after another.

have nothing but "I."

end the day with "I."

In Korea it's more widely loved
and probably more often sang

And after Koreans had lost their
nation and everything with it

and many then left for a life
elsewhere, the only thing they took

01:32:05.510 --> 01:32:08.610
[ Foreign Language ]

01:32:08.610 --> 01:32:14.320
I have three desks in my study.

01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:16.630
[ Foreign Language ]

01:32:16.630 --> 01:32:19.100
Poetry?

01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:21.180
[ Foreign Language ]

01:32:21.180 --> 01:32:24.160
And long extended epics.

01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:26.300
[ Foreign Language ]

01:32:26.300 --> 01:32:27.780
And you're pros.

01:32:27.780 --> 01:32:29.110
I write in different places.

01:32:29.110 --> 01:32:31.130
[ Foreign Language ]

01:32:31.130 --> 01:32:35.510
And sometimes there
are additional desks.

01:32:35.510 --> 01:32:42.090
[ Foreign Language ]

01:32:42.090 --> 01:32:48.030
A very famous carpenter in
Korea made desks for me.

01:32:48.030 --> 01:32:50.040
[ Foreign Language ]

01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:54.010
Very, very long desk.

01:32:54.010 --> 01:32:55.310
[ Foreign Language ]

01:32:55.310 --> 01:32:59.050
And then all these different chairs
so I can sit different places.

01:32:59.050 --> 01:33:01.080
[ Foreign Language ]

01:33:01.080 --> 01:33:04.980
So my writing is not single.

01:33:04.980 --> 01:33:06.280
It's plural.

01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:08.080
It's multple.

01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:12.200
[ Foreign Language ]

01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:15.510
And certainly I'm not alone one.

01:33:15.510 --> 01:33:27.110
[ Foreign Language ]

01:33:27.110 --> 01:33:29.070
In the space?

01:33:29.070 --> 01:33:31.120
[ Foreign Language ]

01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:32.420
Yeah.

01:33:32.420 --> 01:33:34.230
[ Foreign Language ]

01:33:34.230 --> 01:33:40.510
I'm composed of dust from the
cosmos, from the whole cosmic dust.

01:33:40.510 --> 01:33:54.250
[ Foreign Language ]

01:33:54.250 --> 01:33:58.200
From all these different
stars and planets

01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:02.590
and from all these different
countries and peoples and cultures,

01:34:02.590 --> 01:34:05.510
everything all together make me up.

01:34:05.510 --> 01:34:10.040
[ Foreign Language ]

01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:15.180
But it's true I am a Korean poet.

01:34:15.180 --> 01:34:17.350
[ Foreign Language ]

01:34:17.350 --> 01:34:19.510
I'm very complex.

01:34:19.510 --> 01:34:23.040
[ Foreign Language ]

01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:24.850
It's impossible.

01:34:24.850 --> 01:34:27.510
Nobody can be single and simple.

01:34:27.510 --> 01:34:30.240
[ Foreign Language ]

01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:33.510
Not one doesn't really
exist in this world.

01:34:33.510 --> 01:34:37.650
[ Foreign Language ]

01:34:37.650 --> 01:34:43.510
So this plurality we should
acclaim and be grateful for.

01:34:43.510 --> 01:34:48.120
[ Applause ]

01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:51.780

of the Library of Congress.
