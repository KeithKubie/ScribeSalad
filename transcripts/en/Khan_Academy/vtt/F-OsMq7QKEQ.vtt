00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.730
I'm now going to do it
integration by parts problems.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.870
I think it's just a fun problem
to see because one, it's the

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.300
example a lot of people use,
sometimes even a trick problem

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.920
that's given on a really hard
math exam, or if you go to

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.560
calculus competitions like
I used to in high school.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.470
Not to make myself too-- I was
actually not that geeky as a

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.650
high school student, but I have
to admit, I was a mathlete.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.830
But anyway, this is just a fun
integration by parts problem

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.770
because you actually never have
to evaluate the final integral.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.830
So let's say we want to
take the integral-- it's

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.690
a bit of a classic.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.660
I wouldn't be surprised if your
math teacher does the same

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.790
problem for you, just to show
you integration by parts.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.080
Let's take the integral of e to
the x-- you probably never

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.960
heard of someone call a math
problem a classic, but

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.810
hopefully I will instill in you
this love for mathematics and

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.540
you will also consider this
to be a classic problem.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.760
e to the x times cosine of x.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.490
I think you might already see
where I'm going with this,

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:07.330
because these are both fun
functions, because e to the x

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.870
you can take the derivative,
you could take the

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.280
anti-derivative and it
still stays e to the x.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.510
Cosine of x you take the
derivative, you go to minus

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.980
sign of x, you take the
derivative again then you to

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.270
minus cosine of x, then you
take the derivative again then

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.420
you get a plus sign of x.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.450
It's like this cycle.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.540
The same thing happens when
you take the anti-derivative.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.340
It's not as cool as e to the x,
it doesn't stay exactly the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.390
same, but it kind of cycles.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.690
If you take two
anti-derivatives you get back

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.550
to the negative of itself.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.400
And if you take two
derivatives, you get back

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.780
to the negative of itself.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.320
It's also a pretty cool
function and I think you can

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.850
start to see how integration
by parts might be cool here.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.730
Whenever I do integration by
parts I always like to assume

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.880
that this is the g prime of x.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.070
That e to the x is g prime
of x, because e to the x

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.090
literally doesn't change.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.690
Although we could do this
problem the other way.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.820
Maybe I'll experiment
doing it the other way.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.190
but let's assume this is
g prime of x, and let's

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.410
assume this f of x.

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.450
So this is derivative.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.420
So integration by parts, as we
take the original functions,

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.430
g of x and f of x.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.590
If this is g prime of
x, what's go of x.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.130
What's the anti-derivative
of e to the x.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.270
It's just use e to the x.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.460
I'm going to switch colors,
I don't like this blue.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.200
So this is g of x.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.450
I actually took the
anti-derivative of it, but

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.060
it's the same exact thing.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.320
And then times f of x.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:41.320
Then I want to subtract
the indefinite integral

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.100
of f prime of x.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.715
One, g of x.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.220
This is the same as this, which
are both the anti-derivative of

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.370
this, although they
are all the same.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.830
So this is g of x and then I
would take the derivative

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.050
of f of x. f prime of x.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.770
What's the derivative
of cosine of x?

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.740
It's minus sine of x.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:13.410
So sine of x d x, it's
minus sine of x.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.490
I could put the minus here,
that'll make it look messy, I

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:16.970
could put the minus here
that'll make it messy or I

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.240
could just put minus here and
make these minuses cancel

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.340
out and I get a plus here.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.370
So I get the integral of e to
the x cosine of x d x is equal

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.886
to e to the x cosine of x plus
the integral of e to

00:03:29.886 --> 00:03:32.680
the x sine of x d x.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.410
Hopefully I haven't
confused you too much.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.430
I should actually do some
integration by parts problems

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.280
without e to the x.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.460
It's very hard to keep track
of what I've done here.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:41.250
This is the anti-derivative.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.000
This is the anti-derivative
and this is also the

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
anti-derivative.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.565
This is g prime of
x, this is g of x.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.520
So once again we are not
clear whether we've

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.920
made any progress.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:00.070
We've

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.780
gone from e to the x cosine of
x to e to the x sine of x.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.150
Let's take integration by parts
again, see what happens.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.550
I'm just going to write on the
right side of the equal sign,

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.900
because this might
get a little long.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.620
I'm just going to write this
first part x to the x cosine

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.945
of x plus-- and now let's do
integration by parts again.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.880
For this round of integration
by parts this was g of x, but

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.730
now, for this around, I'm going
to assume it's g prime of x.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.080
Which doesn't really make a
difference because whenever I

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.440
take the anti-derivative of it
to g of x, it stays the same.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.870
And then I'm going to assume
that this is f of x.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:54.370
So integration by parts tells
us we take f of x times g of x,

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.270
so I take this function and the
anti-derivative of

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.130
this function.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.170
The anti-derivative of this
function is once again just e

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:06.940
to the x and then f times that
function unchanged

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.630
time sine of x.

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:16.160
From that I subtract the
integral of the anti-derivative

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.410
of this or I take g of x which
is e to the x, and then the

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.390
derivative of f of
x, f prime of x.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.680
What's the derivative
of sine of x?

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.605
It's cosine of x.

00:05:28.605 --> 00:05:31.590
Cosine of x d of x.

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:32.650
Let's see if we're
getting anywhere.

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.560
It seems like I just keep
adding terms, making it

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.760
more and more complicated.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.980
In order to see if we're
getting anywhere, let me just

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.590
rewrite the whole thing and
maybe get rid of these

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.430
parenthesis, because it's
just a plus, so we can get

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:44.155
rid of the parenthesis.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.220
Let me use a new color.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:51.980
OK.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:06:00.020
So this is the original
problem, e to the x cosine of x

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:05.820
d x equals, and now let me
switch back to this color, it

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:11.920
equals e to the x cosine of x,
and then I can just-- this

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.970
parentheses doesn't matter
because I'm just adding

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:18.730
everything in the parentheses--
e to x cosine of x plus e to

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:35.520
the x sine of x minus e to
the x cosine x access d x.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.330
Now you might think that I
arbitrarily switched colors

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:42.360
here when I rewrote this,
but if you look you might

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.800
see why I actually did
switch colors here.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.740
See anything interesting?

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:48.890
Exactly.

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.590
This is the same thing as
this, just a minus right?

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:55.060
So we're going to do something
what I think to be fairly cool.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:59.110
Let's add this term to both
sides of the equation.

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.140
Let's take this and
let's put it on to this

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:02.420
side of the equation.

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:03.800
If I take this and put
it on this side of the

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.500
equation, what happens?

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.100
I then have two of these on the
left side equation, so that

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:16.250
becomes-- I mean I could write
it out it's e to the x cosine

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:19.250
of x d x plus, right?

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:20.710
Because I'm taking this and I'm
putting it on that side of the

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:26.620
equation, e to the
x cosine of x d x.

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:30.470
That's just the same thing as
2 times the integral of e

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:34.770
to the x cosine of x d x.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:37.560
And then that equals this term.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:45.300
Which equals e to the x cosine
of x plus e to the x sine of x.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.020
I know it's really messy.

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.810
All I have to do now to solve
this integral is divide both

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:52.670
sides by 2 and I'm done.

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:55.240
So let me write it out, this
is very exciting, it's

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.800
the home stretch.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.750
If I divide both sides by 2, I
get-- and I'm going to try to

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:05.740
write it so you can see
everything-- e to the x cosine

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:16.730
of x d x equals and on that
side I have e to the x cosine

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:26.200
of x plus e to the x
sine of x over 2.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.480
I think that's pretty neat.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.720
It's neat how integration by
parts allowed us to do this.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.510
We actually never even have
to evaluate this integral.

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:36.080
We said, this integral is just
the original problem again.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.700
And you can think about
why that happened, right?

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.540
Because these trick
functions cycle.

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:42.030
So we had to do integration
by parts twice to get back

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:43.560
to where we were before.

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:50.010
And then we use that to solve
it without actually having

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:51.330
to evaluate the integral.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.520
And what I also think is cool
is even if you just look

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:57.410
at this solution, it's
kind of neat, right?

00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:01.240
The anti-derivative of e to the
x and-- actually never forget

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:05.560
the plus c, that would've given
me minus 1 point on the exam.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.320
What's kind of cool, the
integral of e to the x cosine

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:13.423
of x is this expression that's
e to the x cosine of x plus e

00:09:13.423 --> 00:09:15.290
to the x sine of
x divided by 2.

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:19.520
It's the average of e to
the x cosine of x and

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.160
e to the x sine of x.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.790
I think that's a pretty neat
property, and you might want

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:30.210
to graph them and play with
them, but it's kind of neat.

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:33.980
Hopefully I have convinced you
that is a classic of a problem,

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:37.130
and you also find it neat, and
I'll see you in the

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:38.640
next presentation.
