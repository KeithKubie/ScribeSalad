00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.100
So if you look at the redo log, it has

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.290
a transaction header, and in between the transaction header and

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.580
end mark are all the changes that have been made

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.740
in that particular critical section by the developer. And for

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.910
each of the address changed within that critical section, what

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.420
is the new data that corresponds to the changes that

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.120
have been made to that page? Similarly what is the

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.030
new data for this range, new data for this range.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.490
That's the structure of this redo log record that

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.220
has been created and forced to the disk. Now,

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.260
when we resume from the crash, what we need

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.020
to do is make sure that the external data

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.760
segments Are updated with all the changes that have

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.270
been made and recorded in the redo log but

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.060
have not yet been applied to the external data

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.460
segments. So crash recovery is of course the whole reason

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.860
for LRVM. And what we're going to do when we resume from crash is read the

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.760
redo log starting from the tail Of the

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.200
entire log segment, and that's where the reverse

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.730
displacements come into play. And once you've read

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.890
the log from the disk, apply to the

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.090
external data segments where it has to go

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.270
to. All of that information is contained in

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.710
the redo log record in terms of the

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.940
transaction. What is the address range that is being

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.700
modified? What is the external data segment that

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.550
particular address range corresponds to? All that information is

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.440
contained in the redo log record. So you

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.880
can take that and apply to the external data

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.570
segment. And once you've done that, you can throw

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.400
away the log. So that's how Crash Recovery works.
