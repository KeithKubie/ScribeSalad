00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:05.450
Let's say I have a horizontal
pipe that at the left end of

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:21.000
the pipe, the cross-sectional
area, area 1, which is equal

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.900
to 2 meters squared.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:36.380
Let's say it tapers off so that
the cross-sectional area

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:44.350
at this end of the pipe,
area 2, is equal to

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.600
half a square meter.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.890
We have some velocity at this
point in the pipe, which is

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.530
v1, and the velocity exiting
the pipe is v2.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.510
The external pressure at this
point is essentially being

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.920
applied rightwards
into the pipe.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:17.980
Let's say that pressure
1 is 10,000 pascals.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.540
The pressure at this end, the
pressure 2-- that's the

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.810
external pressure at that point
in the pipe-- that is

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:33.190
equal to 6,000 pascals.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.620
Given this information,
let's say we have

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.556
water in this pipe.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.700
We're assuming that it's laminar
flow, so there's no

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.420
friction within the pipe, and
there's no turbulence.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.530
Using that, what I want to do
is, I want to figure out what

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.030
is the flow or the flux of the
water in this pipe-- how much

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.000
volume goes either into the pipe
per second, or out of the

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.210
pipe per second?

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.760
We know that those are the going
to be the same numbers,

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.180
because of the equation
of continuity.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:15.500
We know that the flow, which
is R, which is volume per

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.100
amount of time, is the same
thing as the input velocity

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.350
times the input area.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.860
The input area is 2, so it's
2v1, and that also equals the

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.750
output area times output
velocity, so it equals 1/2 v2.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:44.635
We could rewrite this, that v1
is equal to 1/2 R, and that v2

00:02:44.635 --> 00:02:46.510
is equal to 2R.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.650
This immediately tells us that
v2 is coming out at a faster

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.690
rate, and this is based on
the size of the openings.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.810
We know, because V2 is coming
out at a faster rate, but we

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.630
also know because we have much
higher pressure at this end

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.600
than at this end, that the water
is flowing to the right.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.980
The pressure differential, the
pressure gradient, is going to

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.060
the right, so the water
is going to

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.070
spurt out of this end.

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.170
And it's coming in this end.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.380
Let's use Bernoulli's equation
to figure out what the flow

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.110
through this pipe is.

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:32.740
Let's just write it down: P1
plus rho gh1 plus 1/2 rho v1

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:39.370
squared is equal to
P2 plus rho gh2

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.590
plus 1/2 rho v2 squared.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.000
This pipe is level, and the
height at either end is the

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.500
same, so h1 is going
to be equal to h2.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.270
These two terms are going to be
equal, so we can cross them

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.360
out-- we can subtract that value
from both sides, and

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.570
we're just left with P1.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:01.630
What's P1?

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:13.280
P1 is 10,000 pascals plus 1/2
rho times v1 squared.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.720
What's v1?

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.940
That's R over 2-- we figured
that out up here.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:26.160
v2 times R over 2 squared is
equal to P2, and that's 6,000

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:33.520
pascals plus 1/2 rho
times v2 squared.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.360
We figured out what v2 is--
v2 is 2R squared.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.570
Let's just do some
simplification, and so let's

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.130
subtract 6,000 from both sides,
and we're left with

00:04:45.130 --> 00:05:09.470
4,000 plus rho R squared over
8 is equal to 1/2 times R

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:10.070
squared times 4.

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:15.570
So this is 2 rho R squared.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:20.830
We could multiply both sides of
this equation by 8, just to

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.010
get rid of this in the
denominator, so we would get

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:33.620
32,000 plus rho R squared is
equal to 16 rho R squared.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.710
Subtract rho R squared from both
sides of this question,

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:49.550
and we get 32,000 is equal
to 15 rho R squared.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:50.140
Then what's rho?

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.430
What's the density of water?

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:56.200
The density of water is 1,000
kilograms per meter cubed, so

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.900
this is 1,000.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:03.920
Let's divide both sides
by 15 times rho.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:14.350
We get R squared is equal to
32,000 divided by 15 rho-- rho

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:22.470
is 1,000, so R squared is equal
to 32,000 over 15,000,

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.980
which is the same thing
is 32 over 15.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:30.320
R is equal to the square root
of 32 over 15, and that's

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.880
going to be meters
cubed per second.

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:52.920
I get 32 divided by 15 is equal
to 2.1, and the square

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.040
root of that 1.46.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:06.760
So the answer is R is equal to
1.46 meters cubed per second.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.830
That is the volume of water that
is either entering the

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:13.340
system in any given second, or
exiting the system in any

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:14.290
given second.

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:16.910
We can figure out the
velocities, too-- what's the

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:18.790
velocity exiting the system?

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:20.000
What's two times that?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.010
It's 2.8 meters per second
exiting the system, and going

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:31.650
in it is half that, so it's
0.8 meters per second.

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:34.902
Hopefully, that gives you--
actually, 0.7 meters per

00:07:34.902 --> 00:07:40.700
second-- a bit more intuition on
fluids, and that's all I'm

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:41.810
going to do for today.

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:43.370
I'll see you in the next video,
and we're going to do

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:44.620
some stuff on thermodynamics.
