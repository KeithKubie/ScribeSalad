Narrator: When most people
buy a house they need

00:00:02.234 --> 00:00:05.889
to borrow money for some part of
the purchase price of the house.

00:00:05.889 --> 00:00:08.882
Let's say that we have
a house right over here

00:00:08.882 --> 00:00:14.194
and the purchase price is $200,000,

00:00:14.194 --> 00:00:18.600
and I want to buy this house,
and I've saved up $40,000.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.964
I have saved up $40,000,
so this is my savings,

00:00:23.964 --> 00:00:27.253
so I will use this as a down payment,

00:00:27.253 --> 00:00:29.749
but I still need to borrow the rest

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:32.461
of the money in order to get to $200,000.

00:00:32.461 --> 00:00:43.670
I'm going to have to get the
balance, the $160,000 as a loan.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.293
The type of loan that
people that people will get,

00:00:45.293 --> 00:00:49.445
or that they usually get to buy
a house is called a mortgage.

00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:52.946
Mortgage. A mortgage is really just a loan

00:00:52.946 --> 00:00:55.992
where if you don't pay the loan off,

00:00:55.992 --> 00:01:00.069
the person that you borrowed
the money from gets the house.

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:02.860
Another way to think
about it is it's a loan

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.968
that's secured by the house
until you pay off the loan.

00:01:06.968 --> 00:01:08.863
When you pay off the loan
it is your house to keep,

00:01:08.863 --> 00:01:10.970
but at any point if you don't pay it,

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.643
the bank could come and take the house,

00:01:12.643 --> 00:01:14.657
and that is called a foreclosure.

00:01:14.657 --> 00:01:16.787
Now, what I want to focus on in this video

00:01:16.787 --> 00:01:19.629
is the types of mortgage
loans you will typically see,

00:01:19.629 --> 00:01:21.838
and give you at least the beginning

00:01:21.838 --> 00:01:24.467
of an understanding of how to understand

00:01:24.467 --> 00:01:27.092
what these different types of loans mean.

00:01:27.092 --> 00:01:29.562
In all of these scenarios,
let's just assume

00:01:29.562 --> 00:01:33.331
that I'm in the market to borrow $160,000

00:01:33.331 --> 00:01:35.492
for this house I'm about to buy.

00:01:35.492 --> 00:01:39.066
If you look at any
financial website or any

00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:41.227
of the major search-web portals,

00:01:41.227 --> 00:01:43.620
they'll give you quotes
for mortgage rates.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.965
You'll see something like this.

00:01:44.965 --> 00:01:46.263
I made these numbers really simple.

00:01:46.263 --> 00:01:50.275
Normally, you'll have some decimals here;
5.25%, 4.18%.

00:01:50.275 --> 00:01:55.132
I made these numbers a little bit
simpler just to make them simpler.

00:01:55.132 --> 00:01:57.685
These are the typical types
of mortgage you will see,

00:01:57.685 --> 00:01:59.145
but if you contact mortgage
broker they will have

00:01:59.145 --> 00:02:01.353
many, many more types, more exotic types;

00:02:01.353 --> 00:02:02.745
but these are the most common

00:02:02.745 --> 00:02:04.352
and this is what we'll
cover in this video.

00:02:04.352 --> 00:02:06.043
Hopefully they'll give you a sense

00:02:06.043 --> 00:02:08.127
of what the other types
of mortgage is like.

00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:12.069
A 30 year fixed mortgage
means that your payment

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.117
and your interest rate
are fixed over 30 years,

00:02:15.117 --> 00:02:19.996
and over the course of those 30
years you will pay off your loan.

00:02:19.996 --> 00:02:24.227
In this situation, this is a 30 ...

00:02:24.227 --> 00:02:29.242
Let me write it over here, let's
think about a 30 year fixed.

00:02:29.242 --> 00:02:32.640
30 year fixed mortgage.
What will happen is you

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.172
will have a fixed mortgage
payment every month,

00:02:38.172 --> 00:02:41.350
and I'll draw a little bar graph
to show the size of your payment.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.364
You'll see why I'm doing that in a second.

00:02:43.364 --> 00:02:45.696
Let me just draw a little
bit of a graph here.

00:02:45.696 --> 00:02:47.041
Each of these blocks represent

00:02:47.041 --> 00:02:48.814
your monthly payment for that month;

00:02:48.814 --> 00:02:51.711
and I'm just going to make up the
number, let's say it is $2,000.

00:02:51.711 --> 00:02:53.103
I actually haven't figured out the math

00:02:53.103 --> 00:02:55.463
of what is the exact
payment for a 30 year fixed

00:02:55.463 --> 00:02:58.009
with a 5% interest rate for $160,000;

00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:02.889
but, let's just say, for the sake
of simplicity, it's $2,000 a month.

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:10.485
This height right over here,
let me make it like this.

00:03:10.485 --> 00:03:16.557
This is $2,000 a month. $2,000.

00:03:16.557 --> 00:03:21.393
This is month 1, then you
will pay $2,000 in month 2.

00:03:21.393 --> 00:03:23.921
So on and so forth, all the way.

00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:26.831
If you have 30 years times 12 months,

00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:29.271
you're going to get all
the way to month 360;

00:03:29.271 --> 00:03:33.317
and that is going to be your last payment.

00:03:33.317 --> 00:03:36.303
Month 360 is the last payment in year 30,

00:03:36.303 --> 00:03:38.362
and you would have paid off your loan.

00:03:38.362 --> 00:03:41.623
The interesting thing here
is in the first month,

00:03:41.623 --> 00:03:43.591
since you've borrowed
so much from the bank,

00:03:43.591 --> 00:03:46.511
you've borrowed $160,000, the interest

00:03:46.511 --> 00:03:48.989
that you have to pay on it
is going to be pretty large.

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.852
Most of the initial payments
are going to be interest.

00:03:51.852 --> 00:03:54.669
I'm going to do the interest
in this magenta color.

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:58.918
In that first payment. Oh, that's
not magenta. This is magenta.

00:03:58.918 --> 00:04:01.630
In that first payment it's
going to be mostly interest.

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.833
You're going to pay a little
bit off of the actual loan;

00:04:05.833 --> 00:04:08.541
so that right there is
your principle payment.

00:04:08.541 --> 00:04:11.351
Let's say, after that first
month, the principle part

00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:14.581
of that $2,000 is, and
I'm just making up numbers

00:04:14.581 --> 00:04:17.370
for the sake of simplicity,
let's say that is $200,

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.416
and the interest portion is $1,800.

00:04:21.416 --> 00:04:23.749
I'm not actually working it
through with these assumptions.

00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:26.416
You don't even have to assume
that's a $160,000 loan,

00:04:26.416 --> 00:04:28.984
but the general idea here
is after this first month

00:04:28.984 --> 00:04:31.840
you would have paid $200 off of your loan.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.400
If it was $160,000 loan,
after that fist month,

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.668
you don't owe $160,000 minus 2,000,

00:04:38.668 --> 00:04:41.408
because 1,800 of that was interest.

00:04:41.408 --> 00:04:51.418
You now owe $160,000 minus
$200, so you now owe $159,800.

00:04:51.418 --> 00:04:55.590
In the next period your interest
is going to be a little bit lower.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.819
It's going to be just a little bit lower,

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:00.300
and your principle, since you're paying

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.980
the same fixed payment
of $2,000 every month,

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.533
is going to be a little bit higher.

00:05:05.533 --> 00:05:07.954
Maybe it's going to be, in the next month,

00:05:07.954 --> 00:05:10.527
something slightly higher;
I don't know, $202.

00:05:10.527 --> 00:05:13.384
You keep going like that
and the math works out;

00:05:13.384 --> 00:05:15.568
they figure out the payment
so that by that last

00:05:15.568 --> 00:05:19.213
payment you're paying
very little interest,

00:05:19.213 --> 00:05:22.046
you're paying very little interest,

00:05:22.046 --> 00:05:25.003
and most of that last
payment is principle.

00:05:25.003 --> 00:05:27.703
It's actually being used for the loan,

00:05:27.703 --> 00:05:31.256
and then after that last
payment, the loan is paid off.

00:05:31.256 --> 00:05:35.373
This will happen over 30
years; this is a 30 year term.

00:05:35.373 --> 00:05:38.782
A 15 year fixed is the same exact idea,

00:05:38.782 --> 00:05:44.824
except instead of it taking 30 years

00:05:44.824 --> 00:05:48.335
to pay off the loan, you're
going to do it over 15 years.

00:05:48.335 --> 00:05:50.422
Instead of it being 360 months,

00:05:50.422 --> 00:05:57.213
in the 15 year case, it
is going to be 180 months;

00:05:57.213 --> 00:05:59.194
and because of that,
your payment for the same

00:05:59.194 --> 00:06:01.964
loan amount is going to
be higher every month

00:06:01.964 --> 00:06:03.737
because you're paying it off quicker.

00:06:03.737 --> 00:06:05.082
You're paying it off in fewer months.

00:06:05.082 --> 00:06:07.698
Instead of $2,000 a month,
maybe it is something

00:06:07.698 --> 00:06:12.602
like $2,800 a month for the 15 year case.

00:06:12.602 --> 00:06:14.791
You're paying it off quicker.

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:17.641
The 5/1 ARM case, and you'll see,

00:06:17.641 --> 00:06:19.412
and there are many types of ARMs,

00:06:19.412 --> 00:06:20.996
and I'm going to explain to
you in a second what an ARM is,

00:06:20.996 --> 00:06:23.242
but the 5/1 is the most typical.

00:06:23.242 --> 00:06:25.511
I'll explain what that means in a second.

00:06:25.511 --> 00:06:30.312
ARM means 'Adjustable Rate Mortgage.'

00:06:30.312 --> 00:06:34.042
Adjdustable

00:06:34.042 --> 00:06:36.198
Rate

00:06:36.198 --> 00:06:37.928
Mortgage

00:06:37.928 --> 00:06:40.635
As you see, in these situations we had

00:06:40.635 --> 00:06:42.980
the word 'fixed,' and
they were called fixed

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.104
because the interest rate was fixed;

00:06:45.104 --> 00:06:48.282
whatever your remaining
loan balance was you paid

00:06:48.282 --> 00:06:52.545
the same fixed amount of
interest for the next period.

00:06:52.545 --> 00:06:55.927
For this 30 year fixed,
we are being quoted

00:06:55.927 --> 00:06:59.194
a 5% fixed rate over the next
30 years; will not change.

00:06:59.194 --> 00:07:02.764
For the 15 year, we're
quoted a 4% fixed rate.

00:07:02.764 --> 00:07:06.217
For the ARM, the rate can change.

00:07:06.217 --> 00:07:08.993
When someone tells you about a 5/1 ARM,

00:07:08.993 --> 00:07:11.006
they're actually talking about
something called a hybrid ARM;

00:07:11.006 --> 00:07:12.879
but, the general idea behind an adjustable

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:15.858
rate mortgage is the
amount of interest you pay

00:07:15.858 --> 00:07:17.751
on your remaining balance will change.

00:07:17.751 --> 00:07:19.892
It will change according to some index.

00:07:19.892 --> 00:07:23.131
The most typical types of
adjustable rate mortgages

00:07:23.131 --> 00:07:27.412
are things like this hybrid
ARM; so this is a hybrid.

00:07:27.412 --> 00:07:30.879
A hybrid, it's viewed as
a mixture of 2 things,

00:07:30.879 --> 00:07:33.107
or a combination of 2 things.

00:07:33.107 --> 00:07:35.205
What a hybrid adjustable rate mortgage is

00:07:35.205 --> 00:07:38.167
it has fixed rate for some period of time.

00:07:38.167 --> 00:07:43.576
In this case, it's a
fixed rate for 5 years,

00:07:43.576 --> 00:07:47.008
then the interest rate
can change once a year

00:07:47.008 --> 00:07:50.114
after that, or every 1 years after that.

00:07:50.114 --> 00:07:52.918
That's what this right
over here is telling you.

00:07:52.918 --> 00:07:55.918
In the case of an adjustable rate mortgage

00:07:55.918 --> 00:07:58.800
your payment might look
something like this,

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.286
and I'll just make up
numbers for simplicity

00:08:01.286 --> 00:08:03.432
just to give you the flavor
of what it might look like.

00:08:03.432 --> 00:08:08.448
In the case of a 5/1, your
first 5 years are fixed.

00:08:08.448 --> 00:08:13.585
Your first 5 years. Month 1
is going to look like that.

00:08:13.585 --> 00:08:15.707
Month 2 is going to look like that.

00:08:15.707 --> 00:08:17.551
You go all the way to month 60,

00:08:17.551 --> 00:08:19.602
which is the last month in the 5 years

00:08:19.602 --> 00:08:21.133
and it's going to look like that.

00:08:21.133 --> 00:08:24.149
That's 1, that's month
2, that is month 60.

00:08:24.149 --> 00:08:27.854
This is the course of 5 years.

00:08:27.854 --> 00:08:29.843
This is over the course of 5 years.

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:33.936
Over the course of 5 years,
the idea is fairly similar.

00:08:33.936 --> 00:08:36.273
You're going to pay, some
part of this is going

00:08:36.273 --> 00:08:40.138
to be interest, and the remainder is going

00:08:40.138 --> 00:08:42.275
to actually be used to pay down the loan.

00:08:42.275 --> 00:08:44.063
Each month you're going to pay down

00:08:44.063 --> 00:08:45.374
a little bit more of the loan, and you're

00:08:45.374 --> 00:08:47.002
going to have to pay a
little less in interest.

00:08:47.002 --> 00:08:48.845
Make that a little bit bigger.

00:08:48.845 --> 00:08:53.262
You're going to have to pay
a little bit less interest,

00:08:53.262 --> 00:08:56.980
because you have less
remaining on your loan,

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:02.451
but by year 5, or month 60, you
still haven't paid your loan off.

00:09:02.451 --> 00:09:07.063
Maybe the interest is right over there,

00:09:07.063 --> 00:09:08.697
and actually it'll probably
be higher than that.

00:09:08.697 --> 00:09:09.920
I don't want to be too exact,

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:13.596
but maybe your interest is
going to be right over here;

00:09:13.596 --> 00:09:18.567
and this is what you're
paying down from the loan.

00:09:18.567 --> 00:09:21.398
For a hybrid adjustable rate mortgage,

00:09:21.398 --> 00:09:23.810
after that 5 year period, the bank

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:26.135
can now change the interest rate.

00:09:26.135 --> 00:09:27.962
The interest rate is going to be dependent

00:09:27.962 --> 00:09:30.365
on some kind of underlying thing

00:09:30.365 --> 00:09:32.597
that everyone is paying attention to.

00:09:32.597 --> 00:09:36.150
That underlying thing
increases in interest.

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:41.947
In this 5/1 ARM, it starts
off at a 3% interest.

00:09:41.947 --> 00:09:44.246
If, because of the thing that we're paying

00:09:44.246 --> 00:09:47.082
attention to, and I'll talk
more about that in a second,

00:09:47.082 --> 00:09:50.075
interest rates all of a sudden go up.

00:09:50.075 --> 00:09:52.628
Let's say they go up a
lot, then all of a sudden

00:09:52.628 --> 00:09:54.139
your payment could increase.

00:09:54.139 --> 00:09:56.576
Your payment could increase
because the general

00:09:56.576 --> 00:10:00.453
idea behind a 5/1 ARM
is that you are still

00:10:00.453 --> 00:10:03.266
going to pay it off in 30 years.

00:10:03.266 --> 00:10:07.193
They typically, I should
say, have a 30 year term.

00:10:07.193 --> 00:10:09.500
If you just stick with this loan,

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.370
you never try to borrow other money

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.448
to replace this loan, which
is called a refinance,

00:10:13.448 --> 00:10:15.883
if you just stick with this
loan it will take you 30 years

00:10:15.883 --> 00:10:18.208
to pay it off, but after the first 5 years

00:10:18.208 --> 00:10:21.266
the amount of interest
you pay might actually

00:10:21.266 --> 00:10:24.295
change, so your payment
might actually change.

00:10:24.295 --> 00:10:28.008
If the interest rate
goes up, all of a sudden

00:10:28.008 --> 00:10:30.376
you might have to pay a lot more interest

00:10:30.376 --> 00:10:36.892
all of a sudden in month 61, or in year 6.

00:10:36.892 --> 00:10:41.554
Let me do that in, I can do that
part in that same blue color.

00:10:41.554 --> 00:10:44.662
For year 6, since this is a 5/1 ARM,

00:10:44.662 --> 00:10:47.989
they can't change the interest
rate again until year 7,

00:10:47.989 --> 00:10:50.934
so you'll pay this constant
amount until year 7.

00:10:50.934 --> 00:10:53.089
Then, they can change the rate again.

00:10:53.089 --> 00:10:54.742
There usually are some caps

00:10:54.742 --> 00:10:56.840
on how much they can
change the rate each year,

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.958
or how much they can
change the rate in total;

00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.627
but it is a little bit riskier because

00:11:00.627 --> 00:11:02.416
you really don't know
what your payment might be

00:11:02.416 --> 00:11:05.878
in year 6, or year 7, especially
if interest rates go up a lot.

00:11:05.878 --> 00:11:08.917
Now, you might be asking what determines

00:11:08.917 --> 00:11:12.884
what that new interest rate
is in after the 5 years.

00:11:12.884 --> 00:11:15.032
They usually pick some type of index.

00:11:15.032 --> 00:11:18.113
The most typical are,
especially in the United States,

00:11:18.113 --> 00:11:22.573
treasury securities; so,
they'll look at the 10 year

00:11:22.573 --> 00:11:24.904
interest rate that
essentially the government

00:11:24.904 --> 00:11:26.634
has to pay when it borrows money,

00:11:26.634 --> 00:11:28.861
and they'll usually take
some premium over this.

00:11:28.861 --> 00:11:31.888
If the 10 year treasury is at 2%,

00:11:31.888 --> 00:11:35.039
the bank might put in your loan documents

00:11:35.039 --> 00:11:37.733
that after the initial
5 year fixed period,

00:11:37.733 --> 00:11:41.286
you will pay 10 year treasury rate plus,

00:11:41.286 --> 00:11:43.115
maybe you'll pay that plus 1%.

00:11:43.115 --> 00:11:46.548
You start off paying the 3%, that's fixed

00:11:46.548 --> 00:11:48.445
even if the treasury does
all sorts of crazy things,

00:11:48.445 --> 00:11:49.905
even if it goes up to
5%, you're just going

00:11:49.905 --> 00:11:52.778
to keep paying the 3%
for the first 5 years,

00:11:52.778 --> 00:11:56.039
but then in that 6th year, let's say that,

00:11:56.039 --> 00:11:57.646
let me write it over here,

00:11:57.646 --> 00:12:02.069
let's say that in year 6
the treasury security rate

00:12:02.069 --> 00:12:07.381
now has bumped up to 4%, then by contract,

00:12:07.381 --> 00:12:09.019
by what's in your loan document,

00:12:09.019 --> 00:12:11.554
you're going to have to pay that plus 1%.

00:12:11.554 --> 00:12:15.923
Now, your mortgage is
going to reset to have

00:12:15.923 --> 00:12:18.634
a 5% rate, have a higher rate.

00:12:18.634 --> 00:12:20.087
You might get lucky, though.

00:12:20.087 --> 00:12:22.222
Maybe the treasury rate goes down,

00:12:22.222 --> 00:12:24.818
maybe it goes to 1%,
and then your mortgage

00:12:24.818 --> 00:12:27.226
rate would actually be 1% plus 1%,

00:12:27.226 --> 00:12:29.776
so it could actually go down to 2%.

00:12:29.776 --> 00:12:32.907
But the general idea is
that's a little riskier,

00:12:32.907 --> 00:12:34.222
because you really don't know

00:12:34.222 --> 00:12:37.316
how predictable that
payment's going to be.

00:12:37.316 --> 00:12:41.966
Most times, if you look
at quoted interest rates,

00:12:41.966 --> 00:12:45.265
you'll see that the 30
year fixed rate is higher

00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:49.918
than the 15 year fixed rate, which
is higher than the adjustable rate.

00:12:49.918 --> 00:12:52.624
That's because the bank, there's a couple

00:12:52.624 --> 00:12:54.813
of different forms of risk,
but the bank is taking

00:12:54.813 --> 00:12:56.775
the least amount of risk
on the adjustable rate

00:12:56.775 --> 00:13:00.382
mortgage, and taking the most
risk on the 30 year fixed.

00:13:00.382 --> 00:13:02.687
The biggest risk here, there's
the risk that you don't

00:13:02.687 --> 00:13:04.281
pay it off; but that's
why they like to see

00:13:04.281 --> 00:13:05.860
a down payment, because they can get

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:07.466
the house back and
hopefully the house doesn't

00:13:07.466 --> 00:13:09.742
devalue by more than your down payment.

00:13:09.742 --> 00:13:12.575
But, even more than that,
there's an interest rate risk.

00:13:12.575 --> 00:13:14.777
Because what happens if
the bank lends you money,

00:13:14.777 --> 00:13:17.084
lends you a big chunk of money at 5%,

00:13:17.084 --> 00:13:20.123
and that interest rates go up to 6%, 7%,

00:13:20.123 --> 00:13:21.576
what if they go up to 10%?

00:13:21.576 --> 00:13:24.214
What if the bank's borrowing cost,

00:13:24.214 --> 00:13:25.667
the amount of money the
bank has to pay people

00:13:25.667 --> 00:13:27.617
to borrow money, goes up to 10%?

00:13:27.617 --> 00:13:29.547
Then it will be taking
a loss on your loan,

00:13:29.547 --> 00:13:33.134
and they're fixing it
for so long, that's why

00:13:33.134 --> 00:13:34.809
they want to make up for some of that risk

00:13:34.809 --> 00:13:36.278
by charging you higher interest.

00:13:36.278 --> 00:13:39.285
A 15 year loan? A little bit less risk,

00:13:39.285 --> 00:13:41.185
so they'll have a little
bit lower interest.

00:13:41.185 --> 00:13:43.241
A 5/1 ARM? Even lower risk.

00:13:43.241 --> 00:13:45.111
They're only fixed for 5 years,

00:13:45.111 --> 00:13:48.164
and then after that this will float

00:13:48.164 --> 00:13:51.103
with the prevailing interest
rate on an annual basis.

00:13:51.103 --> 00:13:53.204
Hopefully that gives you
a little bit of a primer

00:13:53.204 --> 00:13:56.529
of mortgage interest
rates, but I want to really

00:13:56.529 --> 00:13:59.209
make sure that you don't, just this video

00:13:59.209 --> 00:14:01.479
isn't all you need to take out a loan.

00:14:01.479 --> 00:14:03.445
It's super important to
read the fine details

00:14:03.445 --> 00:14:05.332
on what's happening with that loan,

00:14:05.332 --> 00:14:06.785
especially if you're
buying something more,

00:14:06.785 --> 00:14:08.811
if you're taking out a more exotic loan

00:14:08.811 --> 00:14:10.495
like an adjustable rate mortgage,

00:14:10.495 --> 00:14:14.649
or an interest-only
loan, or an option ARM,

00:14:14.649 --> 00:14:17.594
or any of those more exotic things.
