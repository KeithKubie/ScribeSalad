00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.600
Let p be an odd
prime number and T

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.740
sub p be the following
set of 2 by 2 matrices.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.599
So it's a set of matrices
where each member,

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:12.140
we're just calling
it A where A could

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.920
be made of lowercase,
a, b, c and a.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.570
And then these could take any
values between 0 and p minus 1.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.060
And remember, p was
an odd prime number.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.250
And frankly, all the prime
numbers greater than 2 are odd.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.320
So the number of A in Tp,
so the number of matrices

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.220
such that A is either symmetric
or skew-symmetric or both,

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.820
and the determinant of A is
divisible by p is-- so let's

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.400
just make sure we
understand what

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.820
symmetric and
skew-symmetric mean.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.330
So let's think about
symmetric first.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.230
So a matrix is symmetric
if it equals its transpose.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:54.520
So in this case, a matrix
a b, c, a-- and that's

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.800
what the members of
the set look like.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.299
This is symmetric if this
is equal to its transpose.

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:02.840
And a transpose of
a matrix, you just

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.260
swap the rows and the columns.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.270
So this first row
here, a, b, will

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.780
become the first column, a, b.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.040
And the second row, c, a,
becomes the second column,

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.070
c, a.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.970
So that's what symmetric means.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.560
Now if you just
look at this, that

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.194
means that a is equal
to a. a is equal to a.

00:01:20.194 --> 00:01:21.610
This essentially
means that b will

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.990
have to be equal to c in
any of these matrices that

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.130
are symmetric.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.720
Because that would have to
be equal to that and that

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.400
would have to be equal to that.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.380
Fair enough.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.970
Now let's think about
what skew-symmetric means.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.980
Skew-symmetric just
means that a matrix

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.350
is equal to the negative
of its transpose.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.592
So skew-symmetric
would mean that a,

00:01:47.592 --> 00:01:52.800
b, c, a is equal to the
negative of its transpose.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.860
This is its transpose, so
the negative of its transpose

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.430
is negative a, negative
c, negative b, negative a.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.590
And so the two
results from this mean

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.350
that a would have to be equal
to negative a, which essentially

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.145
means that a has
to be equal to 0.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.860
The only number,
especially in this set,

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.068
where it equals the negative
of each other-- frankly,

00:02:19.068 --> 00:02:22.080
the only number where you equal
the negative of yourself is 0.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.650
So that means a equals 0.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.280
And it also means that b
must be equal to negative c,

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.520
or that c must be
equal to negative b.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.240
So it also means that b
is equal to negative c.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.790
So that's what
either of these mean.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.380
Now, either of these
are going to be true.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.760
We want to find the number
of members of the set, such

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.210
that either of these are
true and the determinant

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.820
of the matrix is divisible by p.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.840
And remember, the
determinant-- let me just

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.680
write this over
here as a reminder.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.560
The determinant of a matrix
A is equal to a, b, c, a.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.720
And it's just equal to
a times a, or a squared,

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.060
minus b times c.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.470
So in this situation over
here, the symmetric matrix,

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:18.100
the determinant here is going
to be equal to a squared minus

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.660
b times c.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.490
But we know that b is equal
to c because it's symmetric.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.510
So it's going to be minus--
we could say minus b squared.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.500
And over here, what's
the determinant

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.900
going to be equal to?

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.780
The determinant of a is going
to be equal to a squared.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.130
Well, we know a is 0, so
that's just going to be 0.

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.275
Minus b times c.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:50.030
If we substitute for c, we know
that c is equal to negative b.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.120
We could write negative
b is equal to c.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.560
So this is the same thing as
negative b times negative b,

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.440
which is equal to b squared.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.984
So if the matrix
is symmetric, we

00:03:59.984 --> 00:04:01.400
know that its
determinant is going

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.980
to be a squared minus b squared.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.090
If it's skew-symmetric,
its determinant

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.260
is going to be equal to b
squared, which is frankly

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.330
going to be the same
thing as c squared.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.030
Now let's think about how
many matrices satisfy this

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.209
where this determinant is
going to be divisible by p.

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.810
So this needs to
be divisible by p.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.240
So first let's just factor this.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.550
This is the same thing, just
because it looks tempting,

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.870
as a plus b times a minus b.

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.430
So this is the determinant
in the symmetric case.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.120
And it needs to be divisible
by p, which essentially means

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.770
it needs to equal some
integer constant times p.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.840
And remember, p was
an odd prime number.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.180
And it's an odd prime number
larger than any of the possible

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.850
a's or b's.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.200
The a's and b's can
only go up to p minus 1.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.510
They start at 0 and they
can only go up to p minus 1.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.590
So this is larger than
any of these numbers.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.380
Now let's think about
how this would work.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.730
In order for this to
be divisible by p,

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.890
that means either the first
term is divisible by p

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.142
or the second term
is divisible by p.

00:05:07.142 --> 00:05:08.100
Let's think about that.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.300
Either the first term or the
second term is divisible by p,

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.840
or I guess in theory,
both terms divisible by p.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.792
So we could say either-- let
me just write it like this.

00:05:18.792 --> 00:05:20.750
So one of those are going
to be divisible by p.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.480
So let's think about how
these could be divisible by p.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.270
So the only way that
this term right over here

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:32.362
could be divisible by p, so
a minus b divisible by p So

00:05:32.362 --> 00:05:33.320
let's think about that.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.980
How can this be divisible by p?

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.930
a and b are both less than p.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:45.550
So their difference is always
going to be smaller than p.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.550
Their difference, by definition,
is going to be smaller than p.

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.214
So how can it be divisible by p?

00:05:51.214 --> 00:05:53.880
Well, the only way it's going to
be divisible by p is if it's 0.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.640
0 is the only number smaller
then p that is divisible by p.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.320
So the only way that this is
going to be divisible by p,

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.610
if a minus b is equal to 0.

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:10.650
Or that's the same thing as
saying that a is equal to b.

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:16.451
Now how many possibilities are
there for a being equal to b?

00:06:16.451 --> 00:06:18.450
Well, we can just look
at all the possibilities.

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:22.430
There are, if we look over
here, there are p possibilities.

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.050
You have one, two, three.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.300
Let me write in
a a darker color.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.300
a could be 0.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.350
That's one possibility.

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.610
Two possibilities,
three possibilities.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.410
And if you were to just count
all the way up, it would be p.

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:34.530
Notice when I'm
counting it, it's

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:36.113
one more than the
number I'm counting.

00:06:36.113 --> 00:06:38.190
So this was p possibilities.

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.804
And then b has to
be the same thing,

00:06:39.804 --> 00:06:41.470
so there's not much
freedom in selecting

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.200
a b once you select the a.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.045
So there are p possibilities
where a is equal to b.

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:55.200
There are p possibilities
of that happening.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.750
And let's just
keep in mind-- so a

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.472
might be equal to 0,
which is equal to b.

00:06:59.472 --> 00:07:01.430
So this would include
both of them equalling 0,

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.230
both of them equaling 1, both
of them equaling 2, all the way

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:06.220
to both of them
equaling p minus 1.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.570
So there are p
possibilities of this.

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:13.430
And let's think about how a
plus b could be divisible by kp.

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:18.090
So remember, both a
and b are less than p.

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:19.647
Both a and b are less than p.

00:07:19.647 --> 00:07:20.980
So this is a thought experiment.

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:29.980
So a plus b could be
equal to 0 times p.

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:31.930
That is a possibility.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:33.570
But frankly, when
you think about it,

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:35.861
that means that a would have
to be equal to negative b.

00:07:35.861 --> 00:07:37.714
But both of these
are positive numbers,

00:07:37.714 --> 00:07:38.880
so that's not a possibility.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.965
So actually, a plus
b can't be 0 times p.

00:07:40.965 --> 00:07:43.640
I said 0 times p based on just
these are both smaller numbers.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.056
But then they would have to
be the negatives of each other

00:07:46.056 --> 00:07:48.450
and both of these
numbers are not negative.

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:50.720
Well, I guess let
me take that back.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:55.450
This would work in the situation
where both a and b are 0.

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:58.510
But we are ready included
that in this over here.

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:00.850
We already included that
in these p possibilities

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:03.170
where a and b are
both equal to 0.

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:04.880
So let's not add to that.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:08.280
Now let's think about, because
this isn't a new possibility.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.750
a plus b is equal to p.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:13.230
Well, that's
completely possible.

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:17.640
How many situations are there
where a plus b is equal to p?

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.140
So if you pick your
a, it completely

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:20.723
determines what your
b is going to be.

00:08:20.723 --> 00:08:22.900
Your b is going to be p minus a

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:26.850
So can a be equal to 0?

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:27.350
Well, no.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:29.790
If a was 0, b
would have to be p.

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:33.909
And we know that b cannot be
p. b can at most be p minus 1.

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:37.564
So a can be 1 and then b would
be p minus 1. a could be 2

00:08:37.564 --> 00:08:38.980
and then b could
be p minus 2, all

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:42.630
the way to a being p minus
1 and then b would be 1.

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:52.310
So over here, there are
p minus 1 possibilities.

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:57.090
And notice they don't overlap.

00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:01.860
And none of these possibilities
is either a or b equal to 0

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:06.420
or is either a or b
equal to each other.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.440
So they're never going
to be equal to each other

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:12.690
because p over 2-- and you don't
have a situation where a plus

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:15.484
b is equal to p, where
they're the same thing.

00:09:15.484 --> 00:09:17.900
Because if they were the same
thing, you'd go to this one.

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.399
And you know this is never going
to be the case because this

00:09:20.399 --> 00:09:21.390
is a prime number.

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:24.620
If it was possible that b could
equal a and this equation hold,

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.830
you would have 2a
is equal to p, a

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:28.660
is equal to p over
2, which would

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:30.200
mean that p is divisible by 2.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:30.850
But it's prime.

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:32.660
It can't be divisible by 2.

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.610
So these are all p minus
1 distinct possibilities.

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:37.420
They don't overlap
with any of these.

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:40.340
a and b are never equal to 0.

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:43.760
And well frankly, a and
b never equal each other

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.270
in these possibilities.

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:47.650
So so far, just from
the symmetric case,

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:50.840
we've counted up minus
1 plus p possibilities.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:56.100
So we've counted up a total
of 2p minus 1 possibilities.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.480
I just added up all of
these possibilities.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.070
Now let's think
about the situation

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:01.790
of being skew-symmetric.

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:03.790
When you're skew-symmetric,
the determinant of a

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:04.845
is equal to b squared.

00:10:06.932 --> 00:10:08.390
And we want the
possibilities where

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:12.070
the determinant
is divisible by p.

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:18.740
So b squared would have
to be equal to k times p.

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:20.050
So let's think about this.

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:30.330
If b times b is divisible by
p-- and remember, both of these

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:33.130
are smaller than
p and p is prime.

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:35.380
That means that either one
of these, or essentially it

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:38.460
means that b would have
to be divisible by p.

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:42.370
It means that b would
have to be divisible by p.

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:46.420
And the only way that b is
going to be divisible by p,

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:51.150
since b is smaller than
p, is if b is equal to 0.

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:53.295
0 divided by any
number other than 0--

00:10:53.295 --> 00:10:55.170
because when you divide
by 0, it's undefined.

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:57.850
But 0 divided by any other
number you have 0 remainder,

00:10:57.850 --> 00:10:59.960
so you can view it as divisible.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.260
So you could say, OK, here's
another possibility here.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.570
But we have to be very,
very, very careful.

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:07.680
We already included that
possibility over here.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:12.000
We already included
the possibility

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.580
of b equaling 0 in
this combination

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:21.050
here where a is equal
to b is equal to 0.

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:21.980
And let me be clear.

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:24.206
We already said over here--
so you might say, wait.

00:11:24.206 --> 00:11:26.080
Over here, we're just
saying b is equal to 0.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.954
We're not saying that
a and b are equal to 0.

00:11:27.954 --> 00:11:29.810
But remember, in the
skew-symmetric case,

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:32.559
a has to be equal to 0.

00:11:32.559 --> 00:11:34.100
So in the case where
b is equal to 0,

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:37.419
you're saying that a
and b are equaling 0,

00:11:37.419 --> 00:11:38.960
but that was one of
the possibilities

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.290
that we considered here.

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:41.810
So that would work,
but we already

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:42.900
counted that possibility.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:47.390
So there's a total of
2p minus 1 possibilities

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:51.850
where a is either
symmetric or skew-symmetric

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:53.900
and the determinant of
a is divisible by p.

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:58.272
So 2p minus 1, the only
answer choice is D.
