FEMALE SPEAKER: So as many of
you, I'm sure, already know,

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.150
George Saunders has been
charming readers and critics

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.110
alike for years with his
truly unique brand

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.540
of speculative fiction.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.880
He's the recipient of a
MacArthur Grant, as well as a

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.110
professor of creative writing
at Syracuse University.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.830
And lucky us-- he's here
to promote his--

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.800
what was, for me at
least-- a long

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.090
awaited new book of stories.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.960
By the way, "Tenth of December"
is available in the

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.900
back via Books Inc. Thank
you so much, you guys.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.610
And please help me welcome
George Saunders.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.956
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:44.956 --> 00:00:45.930
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Thank you.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.320
Thanks everybody for being
here-- nice to see you all.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.240
I thought I would just
read a little sample

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.070
from the new book.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.650
And then we could just talk
informally about writing, or

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.220
maybe the creative process,
or whatever comes up.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.180
So this first thing, I'll
just read a little--

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.200
I was on a reading tour a couple
years ago and I drew

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.200
this Polish driver
who was done.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.600
He'd driven enough.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.920
And he was like a zen driver.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.820
He could drive without
getting you anywhere.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:12.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.140
And he was taking me to this
bookstore reading, and he

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.810
said, "Sir, you go now to do
reading?" I said, "Yeah." He

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.410
said, "Little advice for you.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.110
Don't read too long." And I
thought, oh you know my work.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.380
But basically, you never leave
a literary reading going,

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.260
damn, I wish he'd read
another 40 minutes.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.360
So I'll just give you
a little sample.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.960
And I never was a big sci-fi
reader as a kid.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.010
Except the one real big moment
of my reading, or my cultural

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.450
life, was that moment in Star
Wars when the ships come over

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.920
and you can see that
they're dented and

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.190
rusty and fucked up.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.800
And I thought that was really
a major revelation.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.280
So some of my stuff
is kind of sci-fi.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.440
This is definitely
kind of sci-fi.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.990
And I think it's self
explanatory.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.340
But basically, this
guy is in a--

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.620
well, you don't where he is
at first-- but he's being

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.190
ritually administered these
different kinds of drugs.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.350
And these drugs, as they do,
they change everything.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.390
So he's, you'll see in the
course of the story, there's

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.070
some inflections in his voice
and consciousness that are

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.940
from these drugs that are
being dripped in.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.740
And later you find out that
actually he's in prison.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.660
And his mom has scratched some
money together to get him into

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.750
this slightly nicer prison,
where instead of being a

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.710
prisoner, you're--

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.130
what did we used to call it in
the corporate world-- like a

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.160
research assistant.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.980
So this is a little section
from "Escape from

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.410
Spiderhead." "One.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.310
Drip on?" Abnesti said
over the P.A.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.240
"What's in it?," I said.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.420
"Hilarious," he said.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.980
"Acknowledge," I said.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.950
Abnesti used his remote.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.240
My MobiPak trademark word.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.780
Soon the interior garden
looked really nice.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.510
Everything seemed super clear.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.140
I said out loud, as
I was supposed

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.270
to, what I was feeling.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.900
"Garden looks nice," I
said. "Super clear."

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.980
Abnesti said, "Jeff, how about
we pep up those language

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.520
centers?" "Sure," I said.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.200
"Drip on?" he said.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.100
"Acknowledge," I said.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.170
He added some Verbaluce to the
drip, and soon I was feeling

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.300
the same things but saying
them better.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.960
The garden still looked nice.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.650
It was like the bushes were so
tight seeming and the sun made

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.910
everything stand out.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.710
It was like any moment you
expected some Victorians to

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.370
wander in with their
cups of tea.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.620
It was as if the garden had
become a sort of embodiment of

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.670
the domestic dreams forever
intrinsic to human

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.870
consciousness.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.220
It was as if I could suddenly
discern, in this contemporary

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.330
vignette, the ancient corollary,
through which Plato

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.810
and some of his contemporaries
might have strolled; to wit I

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.430
was sensing the eternal
and the ephemeral.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.660
I sat pleasantly engaged in
these thoughts until the

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.930
Verbaluce began to wane.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.360
At which point, the garden
just looked nice again.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.170
It was something about the
bushes and whatnot.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.525
It made you just want to lay out
there and catch rays and

00:04:18.525 --> 00:04:21.399
think your happy thoughts,
if you get what I mean.

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:23.550
Then whatever else was in the
drip wore off, and I didn't

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.110
feel much about the garden
one way or the other.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.190
My mouth was dry though and my
gut had that post Verbaluce

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.930
feel to it.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.400
"What's going to be cool about
that one?" Abnesti said, "Is,

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.950
say a guy has to stay up late
guarding a perimeter or is at

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.640
school waiting for his kid and
gets bored, but there's some

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.310
nature nearby.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.220
Or say a park ranger has to
work a double shift."

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.400
"That'll be cool," I said.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.420
"That's ED763," he said. "We're
thinking of calling it

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:56.730
NatuGlide or maybe ErthAdmire."
"Those are both

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.500
good," I said.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.170
"Thanks for your help, Jeff,"
he said, which is what he

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.030
always said.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.800
"Only a million years to
go," I said, which is

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.050
what I always said.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.490
Then he said, "Exit the interior
garden now, Jeff.

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.560
Head over to small workroom
two." Into small workroom two

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.620
they sent this pale,
tall girl.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.020
"What do you think?" Abnesti
said over the P.A. "Me?" I

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:28.480
said, "Or her?" "Both,"
Abnesti said.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.590
"Pretty good," I said.

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.700
"Fine, you know," she said,
"normal." Abnesti then asked

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.770
us to rate each other more
quantifiably as per

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.660
pretty, as per sexy.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.010
It appeared we liked each other
about average, i.e. no

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.060
big attraction or revulsion
either way.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.860
Abnesti said, "Jeff, drip on?"
"Acknowledge," I said.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.480
"Heather, drip on?" he said.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.320
"Acknowledge," Heather said.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.540
Then we looked at each other
like, what happens next?

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:05.560
What happened next was Heather
soon looked super good.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.310
And I could tell she thought
the same of me.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.285
It came on so sudden.

00:06:09.285 --> 00:06:10.480
We were like laughing.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.180
How could we not
have seen it--

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.210
how cute the other one was?

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.990
Luckily, there was a couch
in the workroom.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.520
It felt like our drip had, in
addition to whatever they were

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.280
testing, some ED556 in it, which
lowers your shame level

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.350
to like nil.

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.120
Because soon, there on the
couch, off we went.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.940
It was super hot between
us, and not merely

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.160
in a horndog way.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.320
Hot yes, but also just right--

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.970
like if you dreamed of a certain
girl all your life and

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.780
all of a sudden there she was
in your same workroom.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.070
"Jeff," Abnesti said, "I'd like
your permission to pep up

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.900
your language centers?"
"Go for it," I

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.530
said, under her now.

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:50.770
"Drip on," he said.

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.020
"Acknowledge," I said.

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.570
"Me too," Heather said.

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:56.455
"You got it," Abnesti
said with a laugh.

00:06:56.455 --> 00:06:59.880
"Drip on?" "Acknowledge,"
she said all breathless.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.680
Soon, experiencing the benefits
of the flowing

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.490
Verbaluce in our drips, we were
not only fucking really

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.780
well, but also talking
pretty great.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.970
Like instead of just saying the
sex types of things we had

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:12.840
been saying, such as wow, and
oh God, and hell yes, and so

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.770
forth, we now began free styling
re our sensations and

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:21.390
thoughts in elevated diction
with 80% increased vocab, our

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:22.660
well articulated thoughts being

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:25.320
recorded for later analysis.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.610
For me the feeling was
approximately astonishment at

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:29.820
the dawning realization that
this woman was being created

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.070
in real time, directly
from my own mind,

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:34.040
per my deepest longings.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.110
Finally, after all these years,
was my thought, I'd

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.772
found the precise arrangement
of body, face, mind that

00:07:38.772 --> 00:07:41.200
personified all that
was desirable.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.420
The taste of her mouth, that
look of that halo of blondish

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.510
hair spread out around
her cherubic, yet

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:47.890
naughty looking face.

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:50.000
She was beneath me
now, legs way up.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.870
Even, not to be crude or
dishonor the exalted feelings

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:55.220
I was experiencing, the
sensations her vagina was

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.370
producing along the length of
my thrusting penis were

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:01.010
precisely those I had
always hungered for.

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:03.510
Though I had never before this
instant realized that I so

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:05.670
ardently hungered for them.

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:08.690
That is to say a desire would
arise, and concurrently, the

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:12.000
satisfaction of that desire
would also arise.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.350
It was as if A, I longed for a
certain heretofore untasted

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:19.100
taste, until B, said longing
became nearly unbearable, at

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:22.790
which time C, I found a morsel
of food with that exact taste

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:26.610
already in my mouth, perfectly
satisfying my longing.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:29.060
Every utterance, every
adjustment of posture, bespoke

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:29.830
the same thing.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:32.576
We had known each other forever,
were soulmates, had

00:08:32.576 --> 00:08:35.299
met and loved in numerous
preceding lifetimes and would

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:38.090
meet and love in many subsequent
lifetimes, always

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:41.820
with the same transcendentally
stupefying results.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.960
Then there came a hard to
describe, but very real,

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.250
drifting off into a number of
sequential reveries that might

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:49.960
best be described as a
type of nonnarrative

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.860
mind scenery, i.e.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.560
A series of vague mental images
of places I had never

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.260
been, a certain pine packed
valley in high white

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.840
mountains, a chalet type house
in a cul-de-sac, the yard of

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.260
which was overgrown with wide,
stunted, Seussian trees, each

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.410
of which triggered a deep
sentimental longing--

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:10.352
longings that coalesced into and
were soon reduced to one

00:09:10.352 --> 00:09:11.990
central longing, i.e.

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:15.690
An intense longing for Heather,
and Heather alone.

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:18.470
This mind scenery phenomenon was
strongest during our third

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:20.020
bout of lovemaking.

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:22.060
Apparently Abnesti
had included some

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.910
Vivistif in my drip.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:27.210
Afterward our protestations
of love poured forth

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:30.600
simultaneously, linguistically
complex and

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.420
metaphorically rich.

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:34.130
I dare say we had
become poets.

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:36.120
We were allowed to lie there,
limbs intermingled

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.600
for nearly an hour.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:41.180
It was bliss, it was perfection,
it was that

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:42.370
impossible thing--

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:45.060
happiness that does not wilt to
reveal the thin shoots of

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:48.230
some new desire rising
from within it.

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:50.510
We cuddled with a
fierceness/focus that rivaled

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:53.650
the fierceness/focus with
which we had fucked.

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:57.380
There is nothing less about
cuddling vis-a-vis fucking, is

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:58.960
what I mean to say.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.480
We were all over each other in
the super friendly way of

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:05.310
puppies or spouses meeting for
the first time after one of

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:07.930
them has undergone a close
brush with death.

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:13.120
Everything seemed moist,
permeable, sayable.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.470
Then something in the
drip began to wane.

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:19.400
I think Abnesti had shut
off the Verbaluce,

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.700
also the shame reducer.

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.770
Basically, everything
began to dwindle.

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:29.060
Suddenly we felt shy,
but still loving.

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:32.140
We began the process of trying
to talk apres Verbaluce--

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:33.810
always awkward.

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:36.160
Yet, I could see in her eyes
that she was still feeling

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.800
love for me, and I was
definitely still

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.810
feeling love for her.

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:41.940
Well, why not?

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:44.410
We had just fucked
three times.

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:47.360
Why do you think they
call it making love?

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.110
That is what we had just
made three times--

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:50.910
love.

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:54.220
Then Abnesti said, "Drip on?"

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.380
We had kind of forgotten he was
even there behind his one

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:58.270
way mirror.

00:10:58.270 --> 00:10:59.760
I said, "Do we have to?

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.980
We are really liking this right
now." "We're just going

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:05.180
to try to get you guys back to
baseline," he said. "We've got

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:07.000
more to do today."

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.580
"Shit," I said.

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.990
"Rats," she said.

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:13.440
"Drip on?" Abnesti said.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.010
"Acknowledge," we said.

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:18.800
Soon something began
to change.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:25.330
I mean, she was fine, a
handsome, pale girl, but

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:27.480
nothing special.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.750
And I could see that she felt
the same about me, i.e what

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:33.140
had all that fuss been
about just now?

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:35.910
Why weren't we dressed?

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:38.320
We real quick got dressed--

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.170
kind of embarrassing.

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:42.900
Did I love her, or
did she love me?

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.340
Ha, no.

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.560
Then it was time
for her to go.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.450
We shook hands.

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:51.330
Out she went.

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:53.470
Lunch came in on a tray--

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:56.060
spaghetti with chicken chunks.

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:58.080
Man was I hungry.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.590
I spent all of lunch
time thinking.

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:00.140
It was weird.

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:02.780
I had the memory of fucking
Heather, the memory of having

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:05.610
felt the things I'd felt for
her, the memory of having said

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:07.380
the things I'd said to her.

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:10.700
My throat was like raw from how
much I'd said and how fast

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:12.010
I felt compelled to say it.

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:16.690
But in terms of feelings, I
basically had nada left--

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:19.900
just a hot face and some shame
re having fucked three times

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.000
in front of Abnesti.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.430
So I'll stop there and deliver
what "Reading Rainbow" calls a

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:28.290
cliffhanger, and thank you.

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:29.100
[INAUDIBLE]

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:35.230
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:39.070
So now, if anybody has a
question I'm happy to take it.

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:41.380
And there's a funny
phenomenon.

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:42.300
I've been doing a
lot of readings.

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:46.140
And there's this weird thing
where invariably the person

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:48.330
who asks the first question is
the one with the highest

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.060
sexual energy in
the gathering.

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:51.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:52.000
It's weird.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.120
It's like some kind of
Darwinian thing.

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:58.131
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:58.131 --> 00:13:00.920
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.872
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yeah, I
had an idea it was you.

00:13:03.872 --> 00:13:05.122
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:08.470
AUDIENCE: I had the opportunity
the other day to

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:11.670
read a little "New York Times
Magazine" article about you.

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:15.640
And in the back, at the bottom
of it, they mentioned that you

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.120
studied or practiced
some [? Yingla ?]

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:17.810
Buddhism.

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:18.210
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yeah.

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:21.210
AUDIENCE: And a lot of this
stuff, in terms of perception

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:24.520
and having alternate viewpoints,
different ways of

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.830
understanding our experience
and reality, particularly

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:30.010
generating experience and being
able to appreciate that

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:32.150
and work with that came out.

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:36.930
And I wanted to, I guess hear a
couple points about how you

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:41.340
deal with the flexibility of
understanding how we perceive

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:42.510
things and how we generate
[INAUDIBLE].

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:43.520
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Sure, that's
a great question.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:47.930
I think, for me, that the answer
is a little simple,

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:51.060
which is, for me, everything
that I do in fiction is

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:53.790
through the language, like
the individual sentence.

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:55.420
And it's a funny thing, because
when you're a young

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:57.700
writer, you're concept heavy.

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:00.440
And you usually participate
in some version of the

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:04.090
intentional fallacy, which is
your job as a writer is to

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:09.060
pull up the big shit truck full
of meaning or theme and

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:10.750
get the reader [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:13.140
sit there and, bam,
and drop that.

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:16.900
And it's a fundamentally
condescending view.

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.300
Which I think most of us when
we're young artists, we have

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:22.200
that idea, that you're a good
artist to the extent that

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.880
you're conveying some theme.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:28.420
So I had a long period of not
doing much in art, because I

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.430
was operating under
that assumption.

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:33.980
And I had a breakthrough where I
realized that in order to be

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:36.320
in the kind of intimate
relationship you have to be in

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:40.360
with your reader, you have to
commit to not being sure about

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:40.960
what's happening.

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:43.370
In other words, to come into
it with as low content as

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:47.960
possible and feel your way
through it by watching the

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.490
energy coming off the prose.

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:54.230
So that's the main answer for
me, is as I'm writing I'm

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:57.590
imagining an intelligent,
engaged person right over

00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:02.230
here, who's smart and is a
little skeptical and is

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:06.360
watching me to see if I'm going
to pull any tricks.

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.840
And I imagine a little gauge
in my head-- like positive

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.300
over here and negative here.

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:12.340
So as you're reading your own
prose, you're watching that

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:15.330
needle, and you're trying to
keep it up in the positive.

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:18.920
And when it gets negative, then
your job is to be all

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:20.710
right with that.

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:22.690
And like a scientist, to
say well, why did it

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:24.910
do that do you think?

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:28.260
Why is it on page two, nine
lines in, I just felt a little

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:29.740
bit of a drop.

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:32.300
And then, if you can avoid
answering that too

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:35.140
reductively, then it opens up.

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:38.050
So really, in a way, that's the
answer to your question.

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:40.610
But I also was raised
Catholic.

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:43.820
And we did this intense thing
called the stations of the

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:45.860
cross, which maybe
some of you did.

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:48.050
And this was the '60s,
so we really did it.

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:51.380
We did it for five straight
days, naked in the desert

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:53.130
being flayed.

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:55.860
But the thing was, there were
these images of the suffering

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:57.090
of Christ around the room.

00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:59.020
And so you sat and you
looked at each one.

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:00.540
So now it was the
second station.

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:03.570
And there was a little narration
from the Bible.

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:07.310
And then you were to sit,
quietly, and think about it.

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:09.920
And we had one nun who was
wonderful, because she would

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:13.300
say, think about what was Jesus
experiencing and so on.

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.170
And then she'd say, think about
what the Roman soldier

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:16.630
was thinking.

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:18.600
What about that guy-- there's an
image-- what about that guy

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:19.290
standing to the side?

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:20.890
What's his role?

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:24.200
So that was early, like
Novel Writing 101.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.930
But from an early time, the idea
was a part of the fictive

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:29.610
process was generating
empathy for somebody

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:31.670
that you might not.

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:33.152
I'm not sure if I'm answering
your question at all.

00:16:33.152 --> 00:16:34.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.500
GEORGE SAUNDERS: And when
I was a child--

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:38.530
Thank you for your question.

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:39.300
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:42.190
It's really just about how to
appreciate the different ways

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:43.502
of perceiving--

00:16:43.502 --> 00:16:45.560
like you were saying, like you
can have [INAUDIBLE] the

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.470
different characters or
understanding that we create

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:48.850
our reality to a
certain extent.

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:49.200
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Exactly.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.520
And for me, one of the
interesting fictive points is

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:53.610
that if you were trying to make
a quote, unquote accurate

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:58.110
picture of this room, it would
probably consist of 107

00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:01.910
separate mind streams going
at once and occasionally

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:03.250
interacting.

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:06.690
And often the explosiveness of
the interaction has to do with

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:08.000
the mind streams.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.770
He's thinking, no
one respects me.

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:10.960
I never get a break.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.190
And then she's thinking about
her sick mother and she

00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:15.310
inadvertently steps
on his foot.

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:17.060
And a shit storm happens.

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:20.170
But actually it's not really
a physical, it's two mind

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:24.000
streams bumping a little bit.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.814
Congratulations on your
sexual energy also.

00:17:25.814 --> 00:17:29.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:32.160
AUDIENCE: I wondered if you
could say a few things about

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:33.090
your influences.

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:37.650
And the reason that I'm
interested in this is

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:42.570
listening to you in this piece
resurrected for me a powerful

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:44.760
memory of having read "Flowers
for Algernon."

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:45.390
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Oh yeah, sure.

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:47.800
Sure, yep.

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.690
AUDIENCE: I feel like it's
really beautiful

00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:52.970
in a similar way.

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:53.070
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yeah, I know.

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:54.510
I had the same-- when
I was writing the

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:55.590
story, I went oh I remember.

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:57.490
I didn't really remember the
details of the story, but I

00:17:57.490 --> 00:17:59.000
thought, oh I'm channeling
that.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:17:59.600
AUDIENCE: Yeah

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.070
GEORGE SAUNDERS: You know I
think when I was younger, I

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:04.210
hated any kind of suggestion
that my work had anything to

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:06.800
do with anything that
had ever occurred.

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.620
And then as you get older,
you're like well of course,

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:11.030
where else are you going to
come from, except all the

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:12.930
influences that have
passed through you?

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:15.380
So in a way, that they might
be at the heart of that

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:18.800
Picasso thing about, was it
good artists borrow, great

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.200
artists steal?

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:24.030
That saying, yeah of course, in
any kind of work none of us

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:28.180
exist totally originally.

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:31.370
And maybe your supplements as an
artist is your willingness

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:33.710
to let those influences
flow through you.

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:34.750
[INAUDIBLE]

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:36.460
And then the other thing I
noticed is when you're on a

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:38.600
book tour that you always get
the influence question.

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:42.970
And the first thing is to go,
well of course, Shakespeare.

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:45.000
Jesus, Mother Teresa was
quite important, right?

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.900
But then when you really think
about it, for me, the '70s

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:49.240
comics were usually--

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:53.410
Steve Martin in his early
incarnation, Monty Python,

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:54.250
George Carlin.

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:58.290
And in our school, that was
really a way to get a little

00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:00.770
bit of credibility is that you
could stand up and recite the

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:03.810
George Carlin album or do
a passable Steve Martin.

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:07.580
So I had a long period where I
really considered that low--

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:08.500
not literary.

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:12.690
And because of where I came
from, I thought, well

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:13.390
literature--

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:14.570
I never had met writers.

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:17.280
Literature is a thing that you
can't quite do, where you

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.820
totally become someone else.

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:22.250
And only at this crisis point,
I went well maybe not.

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:25.310
Maybe literature is where you
really open up the valve to

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:26.680
everybody that you've been.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:29.920
And for me that meant letting
in the sound of vestigial

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:33.200
Steve Martin and the
Monty Python.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.950
So I think influence can
sometimes may be more full

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:38.590
body than we think it is.

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:39.960
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:43.320
I saw you come to Google
about five years ago.

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.820
And I wanted to hear you talk
a little bit about what it

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:49.790
must be like five years later
to have some of your stories

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:52.800
coming true and we're
making them happen.

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.560
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yeah.

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.005
AUDIENCE: My neighbors, for
example, just got some

00:19:57.005 --> 00:19:58.410
[INAUDIBLE]

00:19:58.410 --> 00:19:59.380
in Atherton.

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:04.930
And so I was just wondering if
you draw, I guess, inspiration

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:07.010
from Silicon Valley?

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:13.400
Or if it's, I don't know, some
other level of inspiration?

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.160
GEORGE SAUNDERS: I don't really
do a lot of research or

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.740
direct tapping for ideas.

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:21.550
But I think my feeling is that
if you were wired right, and

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:25.000
if you were alert enough, even
the most banal moment would be

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.940
crazy and full of wonder.

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:30.610
So the fact that we're here,
we're at Google, we're feeling

00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:34.430
pretty good, most of us
are young, and yet

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:35.620
we know for a fact--

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:36.670
totally verifiable--

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:38.060
that in x number of
years we'll all be

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:40.000
rotting corpses somewhere.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:40.360
We know it.

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:41.230
Why are we so happy?

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:42.505
Why are we eating lunch?

00:20:42.505 --> 00:20:43.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:46.480
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Or even to be
a little more serious, we

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:50.620
venture forth every day in love
with somebody or somebody

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:55.280
is beloved to us, and yet the
incredible vulnerability that

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.470
everyone comes to an end,
including the people

00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:59.380
you love, for sure.

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:01.020
So to me that--

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:04.250
what's weird is the habitual
position of

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:05.780
being OK with that.

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:07.140
Yeah, I know it's true,
but my phone's a

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.310
little low on battery.

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:10.560
It's crazy really.

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:15.670
So to me the inspiration for
the weird pieces is just

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:18.690
through the writing process,
through revising, through

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:22.010
trying not to be dull, to try
to get some sense of that

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:24.240
wonder back into prose.

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:28.900
So I don't really do a lot of
looking for weird things.

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:32.530
Also, the other thing I notice,
I don't really have as

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:35.120
much judgment about contemporary
culture as people

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:35.990
think I do.

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.900
I like it.

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:38.190
I like everything.

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:39.440
I like that--

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:43.470
I won't name companies-- but
some of the dangerous

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:47.330
technological developments,
I think it's interesting.

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:51.430
So to me, the highest position
is to have five or six

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:55.780
opinions, all open,
on your desktop.

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:58.980
And they contradict, and there's
no way to reconcile

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:00.640
them, but you're OK
leaving them open.

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.932
That would be the highest
aspiration.

00:22:03.932 --> 00:22:04.420
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:05.550
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Hi.

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:08.460
AUDIENCE: When you have a story
that plays around with

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.980
characters that are opposites,
do you ever find yourself

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:12.650
having trouble sympathizing
with one?

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:14.550
Or you sympathize more with
one over the other?

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:16.320
GEORGE SAUNDERS:
Totally, yeah.

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.880
The question is if there's two
different characters, do you

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:19.740
have trouble with sympathy?

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:21.080
And I think you absolutely do.

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:21.940
And you should, really.

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:23.690
It would be weird
if you didn't.

00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:27.190
But then I do this kind of
iterative revision thing,

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:29.950
where I just go into it hundreds
and hundreds of

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:32.650
times, each time tweaking a
little something or a lot--

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:35.620
just expressing my opinion
on each draft.

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:39.390
And what's interesting is if you
do that, the first step is

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:41.910
to out yourself on your bias.

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:44.770
Like in this book, there's
a story called "Puppy."

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:48.920
And there's these two mothers
who are very similar, and they

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.060
had the same interests.

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:52.160
And in the end, it's
catastrophic what happens.

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:57.100
And in that story, I definitely
had a bias for the

00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:58.730
poorer of the two women.

00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:01.640
But when I submitted it to the
"New Yorker." she said

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:02.520
something really smart.

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.950
She said, the way you're writing
her dialogue, you're

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:07.480
condescending to her.

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:10.870
Because I had written it really
straight white trash.

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:12.620
And she said, that throws
the story off.

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:13.825
You seem like you're making
fun of her and

00:23:13.825 --> 00:23:14.700
not the other one.

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.280
So in that, the process
was to take her

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.860
dialogue up a little bit.

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:21.570
And in doing that, she became
a more full person.

00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:22.660
And I liked her better.

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:25.170
So for that story, the critical
thing was to do just

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:26.900
what you're saying-- adjust
it, so that there's some

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:29.520
semblance of equity
between the two.

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.720
But I think as a general writing
principle, your main

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:35.360
job is to do something
and then notice it.

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:38.060
And then adjust accordingly.

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:40.240
And then notice the thing that
you've done, and adjust

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.200
accordingly--

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.990
rinse, lather, repeat
a million times.

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:47.420
And then weirdly, in time, the
story will adjust itself

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:50.540
morally to be more fair, which
is really a weird thing.

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:51.610
But yeah, I think you should.

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:54.220
Of course, you would.

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:55.640
AUDIENCE: I think it's really
interesting what you said

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:59.310
about acknowledging how your own
mindset has changed as a

00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:01.630
writer from a more professorial

00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:04.070
place to more engaging--

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:07.050
to combine that with what sounds
like a very intense

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:09.080
iterative visionary
writing style.

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.920
Do you ever have the desire, or
do you ever go back to your

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.920
earlier work thinking I
can punch this out.

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:15.380
GEORGE SAUNDERS: No.

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:17.755
It's so bad, I don't even try.

00:24:17.755 --> 00:24:18.850
I'll give you an example.

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:19.890
This is a true story.

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:25.050
My wife and I we got engaged in
three weeks, and we had a

00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:25.950
baby right away.

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:26.850
And so we were racing.

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:28.560
And I was working for a
company called Rating.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:32.260
I was a tech writer, and a very
low level tech writer.

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:36.380
And my wife had been married
once before, and had a more

00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:38.640
full, better, a richer life--

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:39.260
I'll put it that way.

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:41.550
And I could feel her looking at
me like, come on, let's get

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:42.320
something going.

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:44.460
So I went on this
trip to Mexico.

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:47.070
And it was this perfect
novelist trip.

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:51.430
It was a wedding, there was a
male model slash surfer who

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:53.110
was in the wedding party, there
was a guy who just out

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:55.800
of jail for a DWI, there was
a radical Catholic priest.

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:56.800
I'm like, this is it!

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:59.360
It's a gift from God.

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:00.520
So I came home.

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.270
I'm like, honey, you're
sitting on a goldmine.

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:03.560
Don't worry, I got it.

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:06.210
So I wrote this novel for about
a year and a half, and

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:08.320
we had one daughter
by that time.

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:11.920
So I get home from work, drink
a pot of coffee, and if I was

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.860
feeling really ambitious a
bottle of Boone's Farm, which

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:15.380
is a deadly combo.

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:18.400
And I would write just until I
would drop at the desk, go to

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:20.600
work, and I did this for
a year and a half.

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:21.960
And then I had the book.

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:23.970
And it was 700 pages.

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:26.370
And I thought, no I'm
a minimalist.

00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:27.320
So I cut it.

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:30.810
I cut it to 400, rock hard.

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:33.550
And so I said, I think I've got
a little novel for you to

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:34.340
read, sweety.

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:35.210
So she said, OK.

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:37.350
So I said, just take
your time.

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:38.500
I'll give you a week or so.

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:40.850
And of course, like any writer,
in an hour later I'm

00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:42.220
looking in the room.

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:46.840
And she's literally sitting at
the desk like this, fried.

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:50.112
So to give you an idea, the
name of that book was "Le

00:25:50.112 --> 00:25:54.990
Bourda de Eduardo." Which I
think just means Ed's wedding.

00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:56.580
So I don't ever go
back to that.

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:57.440
That stuff has a taint on it.

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.500
I just would rather
move ahead.

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:01.465
Thank you bringing up that
painful subject.

00:26:01.465 --> 00:26:05.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:07.560
But the one thing that I am
interested in, and I'm sure

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:11.890
this is true for you guys too,
in any kind of creative work,

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:13.930
that moment where you--

00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:15.880
Donald Barthelme has a great
essay called "I'm not

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:20.750
Knowing." And he says the
writer's that person who

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:23.360
embarking on her task has
no idea what to do.

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:26.420
And that, to me, seems like
the sacred state,

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:27.640
if you can get there.

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:30.010
And then Stuart Dybek, this
great Chicago writer, has this

00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:34.190
thing about the story Is
always talking to you.

00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:35.670
And your job is to listen.

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:37.900
But for some reason, we have a
tendency to not really want to

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:40.560
hear what the story's natural
energy is saying.

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:42.310
But we want to override it.

00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:48.610
And so I was a geophysical
engineer, that was one of the

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:51.370
big basic scientific principles
was you don't go

00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:54.960
into a study rooting
for some answer.

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.710
So that was very helpful
in writing.

00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:59.640
AUDIENCE: I was wondering if
you could speak a bit about

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:01.370
your editing process.

00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:03.911
Specifically, I read somewhere
that "The Semplica Girl

00:27:03.911 --> 00:27:10.410
Diaries" started out as a 200
page story and evolved into a

00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:11.600
10 page story.

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:12.000
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yeah.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.940
AUDIENCE: And I guess without
spoiling it for everyone, I'm

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:16.990
wondering what got left out
and how you decided.

00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:17.940
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Sure.

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:19.670
So the question is about
the editing process.

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:21.810
And I had a story called "The
Semplica Girl Diaries" which

00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:24.530
started in '98 and I finish
it last spring.

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:27.040
And it was up to some huge
number of pages and got

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:29.980
drastically cut.

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:33.680
One of my things is I think as
artists we have to submit to

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:35.970
our neuroses a little bit.

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:40.840
So often we think that to be an
artist, you have to conquer

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:42.200
your neuroses and
be a perfectly

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.440
calm, wonderful person.

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:47.130
But my experience was rather
you turn towards with your

00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:49.950
ticks and go OK, come on.

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:54.160
So for me I have a real, just
like inner nun syndrome, like

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:56.690
I really don't like what I do.

00:27:56.690 --> 00:28:00.240
When I do it, I feel like, ugh,
Mr. Saunders, what do you

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:02.760
think you are smarty pants?

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.680
So that ends up to be, if you
keep it in check, a pretty

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:09.160
valuable editing tool.

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:11.430
And I have a slight aversion,
I've always had this since I

00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:14.930
was a kid, an aversion to what
I consider banal language.

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:16.160
You know when you're in grade
school and they have those

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:18.910
little readers, and it's like,
Jimmy was a bright happy boy

00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:20.520
as he bounced into the room
in the middle of a

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:21.690
bright, fall day.

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:23.300
It actually made me
a little sick.

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:24.710
There was something
so unessential

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:27.120
about it, and blah.

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:29.520
So for me, one of the things
that I do is I'll get

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:32.650
something up to a decent length,
pretty happily, with

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:33.950
that feeling that all is well.

00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:39.990
And then that inner nun thing
will come in and speed it up.

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:42.800
And I think the subtext to that
is do you respect your

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:44.210
reader's intelligence?

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:46.050
So I'll give you an exaggerated
example.

00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:50.110
If you have in a first draft
something like, Bob came

00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:53.550
happily into the room and sat
down on the blue couch.

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:56.750
Perfectly functional
sentence right?

00:28:56.750 --> 00:29:00.910
But it bugs me, because you
think, wait, why does he have

00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:03.240
to sit down on a couch?

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:05.590
Can you sit up on a couch?

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:07.850
All right, well let's
cut the word down.

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:09.940
Bob came happily into the room
and sat on the blue couch.

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:16.540
Why does he have to come
into the room?

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:19.110
Is there any meaning to him
coming into the room?

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:20.300
Not that we know of--

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:21.910
OK, cut.

00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:23.270
Bob happily--

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:24.340
I don't care.

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:26.850
We don't care about
Bob's happiness.

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:30.240
Bob sat on the blue couch.

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:31.120
Blue?

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:33.690
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Does
blue signify?

00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:34.920
Not really--

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.650
OK, Bob sat on the couch.

00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:40.920
Bob?

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:43.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:44.080
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Cut it.

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:47.720
So now we don't have much, but
what we have doesn't suck.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.230
We have Bob.

00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:52.840
So in a slightly less radical
way, I apply that kind of

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:53.570
thinking to the story.

00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:57.780
And the logic is, if I'm making
those really seem like

00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:00.570
nitpicky decisions, every time
I do it, I'm honoring your

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:02.670
intelligence a little bit.

00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:05.230
That which you could assume,
I'm going to assume that

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:07.030
you're smart enough to assume.

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:09.760
And in my model of reading, the
whole thing is to get you

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:12.340
stepping closer and
closer and closer,

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:14.570
trusting me more and more.

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:16.930
And in the process of trusting
me more, the fictive reality

00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:19.100
is becoming more three
dimensional.

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:21.590
And you get that magical
fictional moment where you and

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:24.670
the character aren't different,
and you can't

00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:28.790
negotiate your way out of the
cliff that's approaching.

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:31.030
And I think that process
is done--

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:35.890
one way it can be done is by
this micro editing to assume

00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:36.100
intelligence.

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:38.500
So on that story, it
was 180 pages.

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:41.920
But at page 30, you were
asleep, basically.

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:43.210
There was no urgency in it.

00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:45.870
So then part of the job is just
to say OK, those are just

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:49.880
pages and now time
to trim it back.

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:53.270
I don't know if that answers
your question, but yeah.

00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:53.420
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:53.810
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Hi.

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:55.540
AUDIENCE: Thanks for
coming back.

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:57.490
You just explained how you spent
actually quite a lot of

00:30:57.490 --> 00:30:59.260
time writing books.

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:00.860
Ed's wedding was a
year and a half.

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:01.330
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yep.

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:02.490
AUDIENCE: Stuff like that.

00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:05.570
How do you motivate yourself to
just keep on going through

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:06.440
all that time?

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:07.910
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Right.

00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:11.360
You know, honestly
it's just ego.

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:12.870
I mean, I really like writing.

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:14.500
And I like to be known
as a writer.

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:16.250
And I like the whole schtick.

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:20.400
But to me the most horrifying
moment is when you send

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:24.820
something out too soon, or that
moment where you have

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:27.990
misidentified something shitty
as good, and it's got your

00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:29.110
name on it.

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:30.110
It's like ugh.

00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:30.800
It's a nightmare.

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:37.150
So for me, I have from high
school, I loved the-- yeah.

00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:39.140
Some people, they want
to be songwriters or

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:40.440
they want to be whatever.

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.340
I really wanted to be a
short story writer.

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:47.110
And it makes me really happy
to be in that harness.

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:50.730
So I'll get something like that
"Semplica Girl Stories."

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:53.790
I had it in pretty good
shape in 1999--

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:55.110
pretty good.

00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:59.130
But on a scale of 10, it was
about a seven and a half.

00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:02.690
And I could feel that I could
get it up to 8.3 for sure.

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:05.570
And at that point, I don't
really care how long it takes.

00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:08.200
So it's a lot of
negative urge--

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:14.600
ego, grasping, desperation,
but also the pleasure.

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:18.160
I feel like once you've taken
a story, any project you're

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:21.560
in, once you've really stuck
with one to the end and seen

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:24.410
the benefits, for me that's
a bit addictive.

00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:28.000
I know what a finished story
feels like, and I'm just not

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.510
interested in not
getting there.

00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:33.160
So then it's weird, because it
becomes a suspension of time,

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:36.120
where that story
took 12 years.

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:37.370
That's all right.

00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:38.070
It's out.

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:39.320
It's better than it was.

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:45.480
AUDIENCE: So I'm taking a short
story writing class up

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:48.415
at Stanford, and we read
"CivilWarLand" in "Bad

00:32:48.415 --> 00:32:52.270
Decline." And the whole class
really loved the whole book.

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:56.340
And we discuss your short
stories all the time.

00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:59.150
So I wanted to ask you as a
professor of creative writing,

00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:00.860
what do you think makes
a great writer?

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:02.240
Is it experience?

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:04.040
Is it focus?

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.810
Is it getting an MFA?

00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:07.660
Is it getting a Ph.D.?

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:11.600
Or being an engineer and then
having that experience?

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:12.170
What do you think--

00:33:12.170 --> 00:33:12.890
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Right.

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:17.393
Yeah, so if you can do all
of those, you're good.

00:33:17.393 --> 00:33:19.150
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:19.150 --> 00:33:20.030
GEORGE SAUNDERS: No, that's
a great question.

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:23.420
You know what's funny is that we
are in a moment in America

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:27.520
where the MFA is getting
a big head.

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:29.310
And Gary Shteyngart, he
had this great line.

00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:30.980
He said, we have reached the
point in American literary

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:33.190
culture where the number of
readers is exactly equal to

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:34.120
the number of writers.

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:35.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.740
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yeah.

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:39.350
And I teach in a
great program.

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:42.140
But there's two fallacies that
need to be debunked.

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:46.150
One is to be a writer, you
have to get an MFA.

00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:47.550
False.

00:33:47.550 --> 00:33:50.060
Two is if you get an MFA, you'll
be a published writer.

00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:52.060
False.

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:54.410
We've seen a doubling
at Syracuse.

00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:57.030
When I go home I have
560 applications to

00:33:57.030 --> 00:33:58.780
read for six spots.

00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:02.390
And the vast majority are from
people who are just coming

00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:03.440
from undergrad.

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:05.110
So there's something
weird about that.

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:08.030
It's not quite right.

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:11.489
But when they come, our students
are off the charts.

00:34:11.489 --> 00:34:15.480
But the thing we teach them-- we
try to teach them-- is that

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:18.210
the answer to your question
is nobody knows.

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:19.949
Nobody knows.

00:34:19.949 --> 00:34:22.360
You can be the smartest person
in the room, the most

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:26.790
articulate, the most well
traveled, the most soulful,

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:30.570
and you can put pen to paper and
you don't have any oomph.

00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:32.870
Or you can be a little
nondescript person with no

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:36.389
opinions who just has never
really done anything, and

00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:39.340
somehow when you put the
pen to paper, this--

00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:42.139
So that's the hard thing.

00:34:42.139 --> 00:34:46.150
But it isn't true of anything
worth doing?

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:48.699
There's an x factor
that's magical.

00:34:48.699 --> 00:34:51.300
So what you can do is
you can do the work.

00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:52.460
I think that's really
important.

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:55.840
And I found out yesterday that
I've been telling a vicious

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:58.800
lie about Robert Frost
for about 10 years.

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.890
I had a student who told
me, I thought--

00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:02.010
I maybe misheard him--

00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:05.400
that Frost was doing a seminar
at a grad school.

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:08.710
And a student asked a really
involved technical question

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:09.850
about the sonnet.

00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:14.580
And Frost, to debunk his over
conceptual mind said, son,

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:17.210
don't worry, work.

00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:18.880
And I've been saying for years,
that's great advice,

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.586
because Malcolm Gladwell's
10,000 hour rule, and blah,

00:35:21.586 --> 00:35:21.770
blah, blah.

00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:23.500
Well, I just found out that
he didn't say that.

00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:24.610
He said, "Don't work.

00:35:24.610 --> 00:35:25.520
Worry."

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:26.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:27.290
GEORGE SAUNDERS: So
I don't know what

00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:30.440
the hell he was thinking.

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:33.900
But I think what you'll find is
it's something that some of

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:35.290
us want so desperately--

00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:37.700
to be good writers, I think
partly because it feels like

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:39.820
consciousness.

00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:42.840
When you read a great writer,
you feel like you've been

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:44.270
really seen.

00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:46.330
And you would love
to be the person

00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:47.850
who's giving that feeling.

00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:51.970
But because it's so hard, I
think it's got to be mystery.

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:54.670
I do think that for an
individual writer, if you put

00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:57.910
the 10,000 hours in, you'll both
find out what your issues

00:35:57.910 --> 00:36:01.080
are, and you'll find really
weird, unique solutions that

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.170
you never could have imagined
at the outset.

00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:06.740
But that process has almost
nothing to do with whether

00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:08.210
you'll ultimately
be published.

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:11.970
So it's tricky.

00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:13.060
And you won't make any money.

00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:15.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:19.020
AUDIENCE: So consuming art is
very personal process, so it's

00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:21.030
really hard to say that
someone was wrong

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:21.710
when they did it.

00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:24.750
But in all your work, have you
ever witnessed someone

00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:27.110
observing something you wrote
and just interpreting it very

00:36:27.110 --> 00:36:29.160
surprisingly, or wrong?

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:30.820
And how did that
make you feel?

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:31.560
How did that go?

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:32.390
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yeah.

00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:34.100
When you said that, it brought
back one thing to mind.

00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:36.120
I had written a story called
"Winky" which is

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:36.940
in the second book.

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:39.880
And it's this story about this
guy who goes to a self help

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:43.240
seminar, and it is the motto of
this thing is, "Don't let

00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:45.080
anybody crap in your oatmeal."

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:49.550
And at home he's got this dim,
very religious sister who has

00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:51.980
been kicked out of her house,
and she's living with him.

00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:53.500
And he wants to get
rid of her.

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:55.520
So he's thinking, I'm not going
to let her crap in my

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:58.330
oatmeal, even though she's nice
and innocent and sweet

00:36:58.330 --> 00:37:00.940
and has nowhere else to go, I've
got to live into my own

00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:01.940
personal power.

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:03.900
So it's obviously a tongue
in cheek thing.

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:06.820
And in the story, he
goes home, he's

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:07.910
resolved to kick her out.

00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:09.790
And when he sees
her, he can't.

00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:10.880
And he melts.

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:13.520
But the kicker is that he feels
terrible that he's not a

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:14.620
powerful enough person.

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:15.680
So that's the story.

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:17.930
So it came out in the "New
Yorker." And about a week

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:18.860
later, I get this letter.

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:21.110
And this guy says, my
name is so and so.

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:24.970
I work with Charlton Heston
at the NRA, so I suspect

00:37:24.970 --> 00:37:26.220
politically we have
our differences.

00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:31.800
But I loved your story.

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:33.540
It helped me so much.

00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:35.280
This is a great example
of art crossing

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:36.540
the left/right divide.

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:38.940
And of course, I was
like, ye check off!

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:41.170
See, I did it.

00:37:41.170 --> 00:37:43.840
And so of course, fishing for
further compliments, I said,

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:46.500
oh thank you so much brother.

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:50.110
Tell me a little more about
how I changed your life.

00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:53.440
And he said, well my mother
is in very good health.

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:57.040
She's 72, and she had a very
mild stroke, which has caused

00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:58.130
me some inconvenience.

00:37:58.130 --> 00:38:01.163
And your story convinced me
to put her in a rest home.

00:38:01.163 --> 00:38:04.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:07.440
And I was like, what?

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:08.990
And I wrote him back
this long thing.

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:10.330
No sir, please, you've
misunderstood.

00:38:10.330 --> 00:38:12.840
And I gave him the whole
exogesis of the thing.

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:15.170
And he's like, that's cool,
have a good day.

00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:16.580
That was that.

00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:19.260
So yeah, I think once you put
something out there, there is

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:21.770
no freaking telling what
someone's going

00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:23.280
to read into it.

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:24.420
But what I've noticed is,

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:26.790
statistically, most people don't.

00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:27.850
And that guy was looking.

00:38:27.850 --> 00:38:30.040
I mean, he could have gotten
that excuse from a Starbucks

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:32.550
cup, reading the coffee
grounds or something.

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:35.720
But I think you have to assume
that-- and it's interesting to

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:38.155
do a tour, and this book is
actually selling, so I'm

00:38:38.155 --> 00:38:38.950
meeting a lot of people.

00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:42.830
And it's amazing how many good
hearted, good readers there

00:38:42.830 --> 00:38:44.360
are who do get more--

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:46.730
get what you put in it
and then even more.

00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:48.610
So mostly not-- that was
the one example I can

00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:50.454
really think of.

00:38:50.454 --> 00:38:53.850
AUDIENCE: Also because of that
story, I say crapping in my

00:38:53.850 --> 00:38:55.500
oatmeal, and no one knows
what I'm talking about.

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:56.430
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yeah.

00:38:56.430 --> 00:38:56.610
See?

00:38:56.610 --> 00:38:59.400
So there was a good outcome
too, so it's a balance.

00:38:59.400 --> 00:38:59.750
Thank you.

00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:01.050
Thanks for the question.

00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:03.700
AUDIENCE: So I just wanted
to address something.

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:07.320
One of the reasons why your
stories grab me is that they

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:09.210
seem so honest.

00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:14.160
And I think I read a reviewer
that said something about how

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:16.740
you can come closer to truth
in fiction sometimes

00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:17.900
than in real life.

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:21.720
So I wanted to ask you, how do
you as you're writing try and

00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:23.720
sidle up to truth
through fiction?

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:24.460
GEORGE SAUNDERS: That's
a great question.

00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:27.290
And I think the answer is
a phrase at a time.

00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:30.970
Because if I think about what do
I think is true, or if you

00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:32.320
think, what's true?

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:34.400
We have some answers.

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:35.610
But mine are a little rickety.

00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:38.460
They're a little conceptual,
they're a little political.

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:41.370
So what I love about fiction is
if you start with anything

00:39:41.370 --> 00:39:45.700
really, any prejudice or
whatever, through this

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:49.990
iterative process of trying to
get your prose not to be a

00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:54.110
buzz kill, basically, then
weirdly you'll gradually move

00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:56.870
towards truth and specificity.

00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:59.870
So if you say, Bob was ugly--

00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:01.056
back to Bob again--

00:40:01.056 --> 00:40:01.790
Bob was ugly.

00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:04.600
Well, if you're a trained
reader, that sentence leaves

00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.660
you a little, eh.

00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:08.970
You're waiting for
detail, right?

00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:11.410
So then if you write
that on Tuesday.

00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:13.790
Wednesday you come back and
say that's vague, let

00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:16.000
me flesh that out.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.050
Bob wore an ugly sweater.

00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:20.610
OK, now suddenly we're talking
about a guy with bad taste.

00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:22.330
It's changed a little bit--

00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:24.050
still not very specific.

00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:28.850
Bob wore a stained red sweater
with the torn blue pocket and

00:40:28.850 --> 00:40:31.380
a reindeer on the abdomen.

00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:33.920
Well, that's a better
sense already.

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:36.720
And suddenly now it's
about Bob is now

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:39.310
a little bit slovenly--

00:40:39.310 --> 00:40:41.200
almost belligerently slovenly.

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:43.570
And that's interesting,
suddenly.

00:40:43.570 --> 00:40:45.950
And then it produces plot too.

00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:47.820
Because having established
that Blob--

00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:48.320
Blob?

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:50.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:50.110 --> 00:40:51.520
GEORGE SAUNDERS: I'm
editing right now.

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:53.480
So having established that
Blob is belligerently

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:57.660
slothful, then we know what
might have to happen to him.

00:40:57.660 --> 00:40:59.440
So in the bad Hollywood
version, he meets an

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:04.170
incredibly neat girl, played
by Angelina Jolie.

00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:08.780
So I think if you take the thing
a phrase at a time, that

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:13.810
boat will mysteriously move
towards truth, and also it'll

00:41:13.810 --> 00:41:15.440
move you to a place
of empathy.

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:19.780
When we live in New York,
upstate, I used to wait for a

00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:22.030
bus across from this
barbershop.

00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:24.000
And there was this middle aged
barber who came out--

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.690
a pear shaped guy-- and
he'd come out with a

00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:26.900
cigarette and a coffee.

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:31.530
And every time a woman walked
by, he would just go, zoom.

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:33.410
And even when she busted him,
he'd just keep looking.

00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:37.300
And we just had our daughters,
so I was like a new feminist.

00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:39.102
And I noticed this guy.

00:41:39.102 --> 00:41:40.700
And I thought, I am going
to nail that guy.

00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:42.920
I am going to write a story
and just make fun of him.

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:45.400
So I started, and it was
really enjoyable--

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:46.600
this guy with this
thought stream

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:49.720
that's always perverted.

00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.090
And then about a year into that,
the story just died.

00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:54.290
I couldn't get it to go
past the middle part.

00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:54.870
It was fun.

00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:58.220
It very funny.

00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:00.540
And it finally occurred to me,
the reason I couldn't get it

00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:04.640
to move is because I was so
intent on kicking him, that I

00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:06.360
wasn't giving him any
hope of getting

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:07.570
out of that low position.

00:42:07.570 --> 00:42:09.670
And that's not a story.

00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:12.320
There has to be at
least a trace--

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:14.630
the hope that the person could
transcend himself.

00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:17.240
So as soon as I did that, I
thought I've got to make this

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.030
guy more sympathetic.

00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:21.547
Now because I'm not that
subtle, I wrote in

00:42:21.547 --> 00:42:22.900
that he had no toes.

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:27.210
So that was my subtle Chekovian
move there.

00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:30.700
But I did it, because suddenly
here's a guy who now he's

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:34.270
still a sexist, and he's
very defensive, and he

00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:36.370
doesn't have any toes.

00:42:36.370 --> 00:42:40.110
So suddenly, oh, poor
guy, and so then the

00:42:40.110 --> 00:42:41.440
story could move ahead.

00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:43.750
So I think that's where the
honesty and everything comes

00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:46.220
from just line by line
immersion in

00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:47.120
the thing, I think.

00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:51.090
Yeah, but the funny thing about
that, because that story

00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:53.160
come out in the "New Yorker."
And by that time, I'd spent

00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:54.800
about three years with
this projection of

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:55.870
this guy in my mind.

00:42:55.870 --> 00:42:57.940
So we happened to
be in that town.

00:42:57.940 --> 00:42:59.810
And I'm walking down the street
with my wife and my two

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:01.970
daughters, and lo and behold
this guy steps

00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:03.240
out onto the sidewalk.

00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:06.400
And I thought, George,
you bastard.

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:08.880
You just mocked this guy in the
"New Yorker." You don't

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:09.580
know who he is.

00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:11.780
He could be a million
[INAUDIBLE]

00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:13.160
the tyranny of fiction.

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:15.950
But as we walked by, he looked
at my wife and my daughters

00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:17.670
and he goes, ladies.

00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:19.263
Like that, and I thought, wow!

00:43:19.263 --> 00:43:21.235
[LAUGTHER]

00:43:21.235 --> 00:43:23.125
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yeah, score!

00:43:26.590 --> 00:43:27.980
AUDIENCE: I'm wondering if you'd
talk a little bit about

00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:31.600
how your process is the same
and/or different when working

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:32.470
on nonfiction rather
than fiction.

00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:33.470
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Sure.

00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:36.250
Yeah, I did a series of
nonfiction pieces for "GQ,"

00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:38.190
mostly travel based pieces.

00:43:38.190 --> 00:43:42.090
And those were such a relief,
because in fiction, as I've

00:43:42.090 --> 00:43:46.320
said, I'm doing a lot of
rewriting to generate plot, to

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:48.470
say, well what's the next thing
that should happen, that

00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:49.640
could happen, that's
meaningful.

00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:52.190
And for some reason, that
takes me a lot of hours.

00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:55.925
So with the nonfiction, you come
home from a week and you

00:43:55.925 --> 00:43:58.690
know there are 10 things
that happened.

00:43:58.690 --> 00:44:00.860
So then the process is just
trying to write those 10 and

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:02.890
see which one of them
comes to life.

00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:06.060
And then once, say six of them
do, four of them don't, then

00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:07.460
you just do a calculation.

00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:10.410
I've got 12,000 words, I
can take this one up,

00:44:10.410 --> 00:44:10.750
turn this one down.

00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:12.495
So it's a little more like
engineering work--

00:44:12.495 --> 00:44:15.720
you're cutting to fit.

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:18.790
And then the meaning of the
story, and the theme, come out

00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:21.920
of which elements have risen to
the occasion a little bit.

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:23.730
So that tends to be faster.

00:44:23.730 --> 00:44:27.140
Your main job is to make
whatever you do charming on a

00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:28.060
sentence to sentence level.

00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:29.620
But the events are
given to you.

00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:33.420
So that's really a nice palate
cleanser in a way.

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:37.210
AUDIENCE: I think I read in an
interview with your editor

00:44:37.210 --> 00:44:40.180
saying that with nonfiction
you tended to give extra

00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:41.730
material to the editor.

00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:41.980
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yeah.

00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:43.520
AUDIENCE: How does that
process work?

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:46.760
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Well,
basically, at "GQ" I always

00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:48.710
had a week long trip
and 12,000 words.

00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:50.850
So you'd get those three
or four bits.

00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:53.570
You're like I can't believe
that's not going in there.

00:44:53.570 --> 00:44:58.410
And you have a point in time
vision of your 12,000 words,

00:44:58.410 --> 00:45:01.210
but this part over here
still feels red hot.

00:45:01.210 --> 00:45:05.080
So in that setting, you had the
liberty of saying what do

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:06.660
you think, should I try
to fit this in?

00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:08.780
And my editor, Andy Ward,
is just a great

00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:09.600
friend and a great guy.

00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:13.340
And he can just say, no, no,
no, yes, put that one in.

00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:15.100
And once he's said that, then
it becomes really like a

00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:15.800
Rubik's cube.

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:18.670
Where does it go, what do I have
to give up to get that

00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:19.370
back, and so on?

00:45:19.370 --> 00:45:22.510
But just to have a second set
of eyes saying, actually no,

00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:25.420
you've got that, that one's not
so good, I think there's

00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:29.590
heat in that third
one, put it in.

00:45:29.590 --> 00:45:32.690
AUDIENCE: My question is about
how your world view influences

00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:34.360
your writing.

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:37.710
In many of your interviews,
you've talked about when you

00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:40.290
started off and you were working
as an engineer, you

00:45:40.290 --> 00:45:43.680
had the sense that things could
go drastically wrong in

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:48.700
your life at any point, how
it was very fragile.

00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:49.040
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Right.

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:52.020
AUDIENCE: And that world view
seems to be reflected in

00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:57.895
stories like "CivilWarLand." And
now you're famous, you're

00:45:57.895 --> 00:46:01.450
well-to-do, and your books have
even started selling.

00:46:01.450 --> 00:46:04.300
I'm wondering how your world
view has changed, and whether

00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:07.720
that change affects how you
write and approach fiction?

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:08.830
GEORGE SAUNDERS: That's a
great question, yeah.

00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:14.000
For me, when we were young, a
writer is like the canary in a

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.080
coal mine in that we were
never in the gulag.

00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:20.610
We were way over extended
on credit

00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:23.000
cards, but not starving.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.070
But I found that just that
little whiff of fear that you

00:46:27.070 --> 00:46:29.930
have when you have small
kids and you're

00:46:29.930 --> 00:46:31.920
not a powerful person--

00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:33.882
that was enough to really--

00:46:33.882 --> 00:46:35.830
you know that great Terry
Eagleton quote about

00:46:35.830 --> 00:46:39.695
"Capitalism plunders the
sensuality of the body." So I

00:46:39.695 --> 00:46:40.380
could feel that.

00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:43.290
And so I got those first
two books out of that.

00:46:43.290 --> 00:46:45.490
Now why that was a revelation,
I'm not quite sure.

00:46:45.490 --> 00:46:47.080
I should have known that.

00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:51.360
So now it's later, and our kids
are wonderful and grown.

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:55.850
And so the one thing I notice,
my desire, what I want to

00:46:55.850 --> 00:46:59.400
accomplish before die is to try
to make a fictional scale

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:03.182
model of the world in which the
positive and the negative,

00:47:03.182 --> 00:47:08.670
the hopeful and the not are
there in a compelling mix.

00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:11.570
And I noticed it --

00:47:11.570 --> 00:47:15.750
when you look at my earlier
work, it's very good at

00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:20.180
showing the potential
for chaos.

00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:22.780
And I just want to try to get
some of the positive valence

00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:24.710
in there, in a way that's
not cheesy, that's not

00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:25.910
sentimental or corny.

00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:28.210
But I think any of us who live
in America in this time,

00:47:28.210 --> 00:47:30.480
you've got to love it.

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:32.190
We're very fortunate.

00:47:32.190 --> 00:47:35.300
Or forget America, you walk
through a field of grass on a

00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:37.370
summer day and they
just cut it--

00:47:37.370 --> 00:47:38.690
pretty good.

00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:43.200
So for some reason, fiction
skews dark.

00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:44.920
Some would say happiness
writes white.

00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:47.070
So technically, I think it's
harder to get the positive

00:47:47.070 --> 00:47:47.600
valences in.

00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:52.520
And that's my mission, but
again, without becoming Mr.

00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:53.840
Positive Thinker--

00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:55.800
the guy who gets a spike through
his head and says what

00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:58.660
a great opportunity.

00:47:58.660 --> 00:47:59.940
And I think the great
writers do it.

00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:03.360
Tolstoy did it, Shakespeare did
it, Virginia Woolf did it,

00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:04.530
Alice Munro does it.

00:48:04.530 --> 00:48:08.420
And so that's my personal
mission.

00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:09.930
AUDIENCE: Just a quick follow
up question on that.

00:48:09.930 --> 00:48:14.310
I think that you are driving
at what was in my mind too.

00:48:14.310 --> 00:48:17.780
Why does fiction tend
to be darker?

00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:18.580
GEORGE SAUNDERS: That's
a great question.

00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:20.960
AUDIENCE: Why is it so difficult
to capture the

00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:23.990
beautiful and positive
moments in our lives?

00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:26.510
GEORGE SAUNDERS: I think one
answer is just the Little Red

00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:29.430
Riding Hood syndrome, which is
if I say once upon a time,

00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:31.390
there was a girl named Little
Red Riding Hood.

00:48:31.390 --> 00:48:33.560
Her mother told her, don't
talk to the wolf,

00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:34.850
and then she didn't.

00:48:34.850 --> 00:48:38.200
[LAUGTHER]

00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:39.390
GEORGE SAUNDERS: So
I think it's just

00:48:39.390 --> 00:48:40.730
something about maybe--

00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:43.110
here, I'm just guessing--
but maybe at some level,

00:48:43.110 --> 00:48:47.995
storytelling is cautionary
in its design.

00:48:47.995 --> 00:48:51.320
And I think that even in the
Bible, these things don't

00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:53.620
often come out well.

00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:55.870
But in the Bible, they do--

00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:57.320
the Resurrection is the big--

00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:58.760
so I think it's possible.

00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:00.950
But for some reason, certainly
at the beginning levels,

00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:04.850
smirking is so easy, to make
fun of something is easy.

00:49:04.850 --> 00:49:06.900
And when we get our
applications, it's funny.

00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:09.850
Because every year, you're
reading young writers.

00:49:09.850 --> 00:49:13.990
And so for example, it turns
out that in that fictive

00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:18.010
country, everybody over
35 is a pedophile--

00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:19.870
everybody.

00:49:19.870 --> 00:49:25.600
And every person, for example,
any midget is a

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:27.790
genius, is a sage.

00:49:27.790 --> 00:49:30.760
Those are the only ones
who ever show up.

00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:32.970
There's tropes that
you get into--

00:49:32.970 --> 00:49:36.240
every stepfather is a terrible
monster, who only reveals

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:37.500
himself on page 12.

00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:39.460
So that's not true.

00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:41.800
It's just a pattern
of imagination.

00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:43.580
So I don't really know
why that is.

00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:45.680
But I know for sure, from
experience, it's harder to get

00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:47.702
into those high registers.

00:49:47.702 --> 00:49:49.590
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:49:49.590 --> 00:49:54.460
I want to ask you about
Hemingway's influence on you.

00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:56.080
I was listening yesterday
at the forum.

00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:59.880
You spoke about how you tried
to imitate him or

00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:00.880
work a lot like him.

00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:03.440
And it was frustrating
at the end.

00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:07.290
And earlier, you spoke
about how you make

00:50:07.290 --> 00:50:09.250
something sound true.

00:50:09.250 --> 00:50:13.000
And I think Hemingway, in one
of his books when he was in

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.490
Paris, I think he tells that
he tries to write something

00:50:16.490 --> 00:50:18.720
that sounds the truest.

00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:21.200
That's a technique,
I think, for him.

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:23.660
If it sounds true, then
it's good enough.

00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:24.110
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Right.

00:50:24.110 --> 00:50:27.790
AUDIENCE: And so my question is,
are there things that you

00:50:27.790 --> 00:50:31.710
learn from Hemingway that you
use in your writings, like

00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:34.830
this one or other things that
you can talk about?

00:50:34.830 --> 00:50:36.700
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yeah,
Hemingway was a huge

00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:39.380
influence, as he is, I think,
on a lot of writers.

00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:42.670
And at some point, you get to
that critical point where your

00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:47.470
worldview and your hero's
diction just don't close.

00:50:47.470 --> 00:50:50.660
So I was living in Amarillo,
Texas and trying to be

00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:51.620
Hemingway too.

00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:55.620
And so you'd go like, Nick
walked into the Walmart .

00:50:55.620 --> 00:50:56.880
It was pleasant.

00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:57.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:57.950 --> 00:50:59.530
GEORGE SAUNDERS: But there's,
for a young writer, that

00:50:59.530 --> 00:51:03.060
wonderful moment where you go I
know things in my gut that I

00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:05.940
can't say in that diction, now
matter if you're imitating

00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:07.220
Kerouac or whoever it is.

00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:11.010
So that is a holy moment for a
young writer, when you start

00:51:11.010 --> 00:51:14.300
getting full body impatient
with your mentor.

00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:18.360
But I did, from him, I think,
just minimalism--

00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:20.550
just cutting, cutting, cutting,
cutting, making sure

00:51:20.550 --> 00:51:26.410
that as much as you can help it,
you're not on auto pilot.

00:51:26.410 --> 00:51:28.246
It was a dark and cloudy day.

00:51:28.246 --> 00:51:29.240
Ugh.

00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:30.580
Really?

00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:33.230
So to just lean into the
sentence the way he did.

00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:35.390
And make sure that the sentence
is not only a

00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:38.120
sentence but it actually can
become a thing in the world

00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:39.955
itself in a certain way.

00:51:39.955 --> 00:51:41.530
AUDIENCE: Do you think
that this style it

00:51:41.530 --> 00:51:42.740
represents his time?

00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:45.860
It's not something you
can use anymore?

00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:47.300
Because [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:50.140
a certain figure of people
[INAUDIBLE].

00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:52.620
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yeah, for me,
what I got tired of in

00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:55.350
Hemingway was that he, in his
later work especially, he

00:51:55.350 --> 00:51:56.010
wasn't funny.

00:51:56.010 --> 00:51:58.020
He didn't have any sense
of humor actually.

00:51:58.020 --> 00:52:00.690
He knew very well who the
noble, interesting

00:52:00.690 --> 00:52:02.550
people were and so on.

00:52:02.550 --> 00:52:04.650
And my life was not--

00:52:04.650 --> 00:52:07.240
I never lived a Hemingwayesque
moment really.

00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:12.120
I remember as a young kid coming
out of a funeral-- a

00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:16.110
very sad, terrible thing.

00:52:16.110 --> 00:52:19.440
But the funeral was being held
in a mock Georgian mansion--

00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:21.580
one of those mansions that had
been put up just to be a

00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:22.650
funeral parlor.

00:52:22.650 --> 00:52:24.360
And then you walk out of
that, and everyone's

00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:25.650
crying and it's terrible.

00:52:25.650 --> 00:52:28.220
And across the street, there's
a Chuck E Cheese.

00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:30.150
And the mouse is on break.

00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:32.210
And he's on the side of the
building with his head off.

00:52:32.210 --> 00:52:34.220
And he's smoking.

00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:36.370
So that moment could not
show up in Hemingway.

00:52:36.370 --> 00:52:37.880
He couldn't do it.

00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:41.210
He had a stylistic cave he
had made for himself.

00:52:41.210 --> 00:52:44.680
And I thought, that's where
the gateway to style is.

00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:46.620
And when you see something in
your life, in your heart, in

00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:50.340
your world that the style of
your hero can't accommodate,

00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:53.030
then it's a time for growth.

00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:53.750
MALE SPEAKER: I'm afraid
we're out of time.

00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:56.130
But I just want to say
thank you for coming.

00:52:56.130 --> 00:52:57.190
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Thank
you very much--

00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:58.090
appreciate it.

00:52:58.090 --> 00:53:02.990
[APPLAUSE]
