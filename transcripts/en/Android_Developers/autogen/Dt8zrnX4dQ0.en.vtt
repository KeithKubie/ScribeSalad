I'm a graphics engineer be making games

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839
I'm a graphics engineer be making games
 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.919
I'm a graphics engineer be making games
since 1999 give or take and I always

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929
since 1999 give or take and I always
 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.359

takeaway for me here is that first I

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550
takeaway for me here is that first I
 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.359

don't have to do it anymore I can just
 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.740
don't have to do it anymore I can just
write the shaders I just write the fun

I just want to do a quick raise hand so

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:07.219
I just want to do a quick raise hand so
 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:12.399
I just want to do a quick raise hand so
who's using unity currently I saw a few

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:12.409
who's using unity currently I saw a few
 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:14.020
who's using unity currently I saw a few
people who didn't raise their hand what

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030
people who didn't raise their hand what
 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.599

unity started more than 10 years ago

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:25.159
unity started more than 10 years ago
 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:28.689
unity started more than 10 years ago
with a vision in mind is that we wanted

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:28.699
with a vision in mind is that we wanted
 

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:31.599
with a vision in mind is that we wanted
to democratize game development really

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609
to democratize game development really
 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:33.939
to democratize game development really
help creators to realize their vision

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:33.949
help creators to realize their vision
 

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:38.050
help creators to realize their vision
and since then well a few million users

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060
and since then well a few million users
 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.050
and since then well a few million users
have tried and used unity and keep using

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060
have tried and used unity and keep using
 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.539
have tried and used unity and keep using
unity but also we've gone beyond games

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549
unity but also we've gone beyond games
 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.439
unity but also we've gone beyond games
so unity is also now powering other

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:47.449
so unity is also now powering other
 

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:49.839
so unity is also now powering other
industries like film automotive

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849
industries like film automotive
 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:52.899
industries like film automotive
simulation architecture and many more

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:52.909
simulation architecture and many more
 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:54.999
simulation architecture and many more
and this is because basically our

00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:55.009
and this is because basically our
 

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:57.280
and this is because basically our
technology is a real-time 3d engines

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290
technology is a real-time 3d engines
 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.140
technology is a real-time 3d engines
really development platform you can do

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150
really development platform you can do
 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.030
really development platform you can do
2d if you want it's just removing one

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040
2d if you want it's just removing one
 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.599
2d if you want it's just removing one
dimension which is fairly easy so and

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609
dimension which is fairly easy so and
 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:06.909
dimension which is fairly easy so and
you need this focus at the beginning was

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:06.919
you need this focus at the beginning was
 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:09.789
you need this focus at the beginning was
really on the Creator helping you to

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799
really on the Creator helping you to

that the world is the better world the
more creator or we have but we've also

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389
more creator or we have but we've also
 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.729
more creator or we have but we've also
realized that creating is only one thing

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739
realized that creating is only one thing
 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.200

way we do that we offer additional
options for unity users to basically

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930
options for unity users to basically
 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.800

give you a sense of unity is not just a

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:07.479
give you a sense of unity is not just a
 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:09.629

game engine it's actually way more than

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:09.639
game engine it's actually way more than
 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:11.909
game engine it's actually way more than
that but today we're going to focus on

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919
that but today we're going to focus on
 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:15.180
that but today we're going to focus on
the creation part and as Fran said in

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190
the creation part and as Fran said in
 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.159
the creation part and as Fran said in
the intro we're going to stop looking at

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169
the intro we're going to stop looking at
 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:21.330
the intro we're going to stop looking at
workflow improvement and I want to

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340
workflow improvement and I want to
 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.480
workflow improvement and I want to
remind some of the goals really that are

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490
remind some of the goals really that are
 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.550
remind some of the goals really that are
critical to goals so first of all I

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560
critical to goals so first of all I
 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.219
critical to goals so first of all I
didn't mention it but one of the key

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:29.229
didn't mention it but one of the key
 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:31.499
didn't mention it but one of the key

development is also to be a

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:33.009
development is also to be a
 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:35.010
development is also to be a
cross-platform engine basically you

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020
cross-platform engine basically you
 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.850
cross-platform engine basically you
build once and you deploy everywhere and

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860
build once and you deploy everywhere and
 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.499
build once and you deploy everywhere and
you know I'll be honest deploying

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:40.509
you know I'll be honest deploying
 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:42.689
you know I'll be honest deploying
everywhere requires always a little bit

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:42.699
everywhere requires always a little bit
 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:44.760
everywhere requires always a little bit
of work but we're trying to make that

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770
of work but we're trying to make that
 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.810
of work but we're trying to make that
work as painless as possible the second

work as painless as possible the second
thing is about general productivity we

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340
thing is about general productivity we
 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.860
thing is about general productivity we
want to give you the tools that makes

you go do you think the fastest as

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.030
you go do you think the fastest as
 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.600
you go do you think the fastest as
possible and we'll go through a few of

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610
possible and we'll go through a few of
 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.330
possible and we'll go through a few of
those new things and iteration of on

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340
those new things and iteration of on
 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.120
those new things and iteration of on
device is really core to the investment

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130

because yes mobile devices are a little

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030
because yes mobile devices are a little
 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.149
because yes mobile devices are a little
tricky and there are many many kinds of

00:06:18.149 --> 00:06:18.159
tricky and there are many many kinds of
 

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:20.730
tricky and there are many many kinds of
devices in the Android ecosystem the

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:20.740
devices in the Android ecosystem the
 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.430
devices in the Android ecosystem the
diversity is so broad that testing on

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440
diversity is so broad that testing on
 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:28.600
diversity is so broad that testing on
device is definitely a must

the different components in 19 - we're

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:33.020
the different components in 19 - we're
 

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.950
the different components in 19 - we're
working on a new feature to enable you

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:35.960
working on a new feature to enable you

working on a new feature to enable you
to manage notification from unity

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:39.050
to manage notification from unity
 

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.080
to manage notification from unity
directly so you don't have to deal with

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:41.090
directly so you don't have to deal with
 

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:43.719
directly so you don't have to deal with
the the low-level system operations and

00:07:43.719 --> 00:07:43.729
the the low-level system operations and
 

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:46.450
the the low-level system operations and
that's a way to do cross-platform

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:46.460
that's a way to do cross-platform
 

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.600
that's a way to do cross-platform
notification for iOS and Android it's

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:49.610
notification for iOS and Android it's
 

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:51.390
notification for iOS and Android it's
going to be delivered as a package and

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:51.400
going to be delivered as a package and
 

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:56.260
going to be delivered as a package and
it's in preview currently so I didn't

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:56.270
it's in preview currently so I didn't
 

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:59.769
it's in preview currently so I didn't
mention in 19:1 the safe area under

00:07:59.769 --> 00:07:59.779
mention in 19:1 the safe area under
 

00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:02.499
mention in 19:1 the safe area under
notes because I have a special slide for

00:08:02.499 --> 00:08:02.509
notes because I have a special slide for
 

00:08:02.509 --> 00:08:06.070

that so starting with nine unity 19 - we

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:06.080
that so starting with nine unity 19 - we
 

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.200
that so starting with nine unity 19 - we
are adding the feature that enables you

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:08.210
are adding the feature that enables you
 

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:11.709
are adding the feature that enables you
to detect cut out area and the safe area

00:08:11.709 --> 00:08:11.719
to detect cut out area and the safe area
 

00:08:11.719 --> 00:08:15.070
to detect cut out area and the safe area
is where you can safely place content

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:15.080
is where you can safely place content
 

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.399
is where you can safely place content
it's not gonna be behind an arch and so

00:08:17.399 --> 00:08:17.409
it's not gonna be behind an arch and so
 

00:08:17.409 --> 00:08:21.040
it's not gonna be behind an arch and so
now ya code you can actually detect what

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:21.050
now ya code you can actually detect what
 

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:22.959
now ya code you can actually detect what
are the different areas the safe area

00:08:22.959 --> 00:08:22.969
are the different areas the safe area
 

00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:26.769
are the different areas the safe area
no problem it tells you where the cutout

00:08:26.769 --> 00:08:26.779
no problem it tells you where the cutout
 

00:08:26.779 --> 00:08:29.619
no problem it tells you where the cutout
is and then you know where the space is

00:08:29.619 --> 00:08:29.629
is and then you know where the space is
 

00:08:29.629 --> 00:08:31.689
is and then you know where the space is
so by the way do you know what phone

00:08:31.689 --> 00:08:31.699
so by the way do you know what phone
 

00:08:31.699 --> 00:08:35.319
so by the way do you know what phone
that is nobody knows when you want to

00:08:35.319 --> 00:08:35.329
that is nobody knows when you want to
 

00:08:35.329 --> 00:08:39.219
that is nobody knows when you want to
guess okay so that's a big sales free

00:08:39.219 --> 00:08:39.229
guess okay so that's a big sales free
 

00:08:39.229 --> 00:08:42.409
guess okay so that's a big sales free
excel so if you running that code

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:42.419
excel so if you running that code
 

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:45.949
excel so if you running that code
actually exactly that code on a pic cell

00:08:45.949 --> 00:08:45.959
actually exactly that code on a pic cell
 

00:08:45.959 --> 00:08:48.230
actually exactly that code on a pic cell
three Excel this is what happens so the

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240
three Excel this is what happens so the
 

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.920
three Excel this is what happens so the
first thing you start defining your

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:50.930
first thing you start defining your
 

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:53.480
first thing you start defining your
screen safe area and that's the red

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:53.490
screen safe area and that's the red
 

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:55.160
screen safe area and that's the red
rectangle that's gonna be that's being

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:55.170
rectangle that's gonna be that's being
 

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:59.930
rectangle that's gonna be that's being
drawn here and then you define a

00:08:59.930 --> 00:08:59.940
drawn here and then you define a
 

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.930
drawn here and then you define a
variable that is the cutouts and there

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:02.940
variable that is the cutouts and there
 

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.120
variable that is the cutouts and there
can be multiple cutouts and you do a

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:05.130
can be multiple cutouts and you do a
 

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:08.030
can be multiple cutouts and you do a
simple loop you check that there's at

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:08.040
simple loop you check that there's at
 

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.009
simple loop you check that there's at
least one cutout and it's just one right

00:09:10.009 --> 00:09:10.019
least one cutout and it's just one right
 

00:09:10.019 --> 00:09:12.680
least one cutout and it's just one right
here we're doing a green rectangle so

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:12.690
here we're doing a green rectangle so
 

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:14.480
here we're doing a green rectangle so
this is really super easy to use and

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:14.490
this is really super easy to use and
 

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.970
this is really super easy to use and
very convenient if you want to maximize

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:16.980
very convenient if you want to maximize
 

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.879
very convenient if you want to maximize
the space that you have on your phones

00:09:19.879 --> 00:09:19.889
the space that you have on your phones
 

00:09:19.889 --> 00:09:22.160
the space that you have on your phones
and by the way that feature also works

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:22.170
and by the way that feature also works
 

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:25.970
and by the way that feature also works
on iPhone so you're gonna get the same

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:25.980
on iPhone so you're gonna get the same
 

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:31.430
on iPhone so you're gonna get the same
code working a cross-platform profiling

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:31.440
code working a cross-platform profiling
 

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.460
code working a cross-platform profiling
it's always challenging when you make a

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:34.470
it's always challenging when you make a
 

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:37.460
it's always challenging when you make a
game it works well on one device and

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:37.470
game it works well on one device and
 

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:39.470
game it works well on one device and
then on Android device maybe it doesn't

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:39.480
then on Android device maybe it doesn't
 

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.230
then on Android device maybe it doesn't
work that well so there's a lot of

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240
work that well so there's a lot of
 

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.900
work that well so there's a lot of
profiling option unity has a pretty

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:44.910
profiling option unity has a pretty
 

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:46.850
profiling option unity has a pretty
advanced profiler that allows you to

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:46.860
advanced profiler that allows you to
 

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:50.030
advanced profiler that allows you to
look inside the game from unity

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:50.040
look inside the game from unity
 

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.970
look inside the game from unity
standpoint but what we've done is unity

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:52.980
standpoint but what we've done is unity
 

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.689
standpoint but what we've done is unity
19:1 we've actually instrumented the

00:09:56.689 --> 00:09:56.699
19:1 we've actually instrumented the
 

00:09:56.699 --> 00:09:58.759
19:1 we've actually instrumented the
build that we make so when you run a

00:09:58.759 --> 00:09:58.769
build that we make so when you run a
 

00:09:58.769 --> 00:10:02.269
build that we make so when you run a
unity game on Android systrace which is

00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:02.279
unity game on Android systrace which is
 

00:10:02.279 --> 00:10:04.939
unity game on Android systrace which is
one of the advanced profiling tool will

00:10:04.939 --> 00:10:04.949
one of the advanced profiling tool will
 

00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:07.699
one of the advanced profiling tool will
actually know inside the unity app

00:10:07.699 --> 00:10:07.709
actually know inside the unity app
 

00:10:07.709 --> 00:10:09.680
actually know inside the unity app
what's going on so on that screenshot it

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:09.690
what's going on so on that screenshot it
 

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:12.139
what's going on so on that screenshot it
shows from systrace which is a native

00:10:12.139 --> 00:10:12.149
shows from systrace which is a native
 

00:10:12.149 --> 00:10:15.530
shows from systrace which is a native
Android profiling tool what are the

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:15.540
Android profiling tool what are the
 

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.750
Android profiling tool what are the
different thread in unity what is the

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:17.760
different thread in unity what is the
 

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.790
different thread in unity what is the
rendering thread what is a main thread

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:19.800
rendering thread what is a main thread
 

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.189
rendering thread what is a main thread
what is the choreographer and so you can

00:10:22.189 --> 00:10:22.199
what is the choreographer and so you can
 

00:10:22.199 --> 00:10:25.759
what is the choreographer and so you can
detect from the outside what's going

00:10:25.759 --> 00:10:25.769
detect from the outside what's going
 

00:10:25.769 --> 00:10:28.250
detect from the outside what's going
wrong or whether what are the problems

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:28.260
wrong or whether what are the problems
 

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.829
wrong or whether what are the problems
potentially that could be caused by some

00:10:30.829 --> 00:10:30.839
potentially that could be caused by some
 

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:32.750
potentially that could be caused by some
interference with other applications

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:32.760
interference with other applications
 

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.120
interference with other applications
running on the system or some weird

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:35.130
running on the system or some weird
 

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:37.519
running on the system or some weird
things that you cannot detect from

00:10:37.519 --> 00:10:37.529
things that you cannot detect from
 

00:10:37.529 --> 00:10:41.120
things that you cannot detect from
within unity so super useful and that's

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:41.130
within unity so super useful and that's
 

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:46.040
within unity so super useful and that's
available now so another more advanced

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:46.050
available now so another more advanced
 

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:49.340
available now so another more advanced
way of debugging is using Android logcat

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:49.350
way of debugging is using Android logcat
 

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:52.579
way of debugging is using Android logcat
so very powerful very verbose debugging

00:10:52.579 --> 00:10:52.589
so very powerful very verbose debugging
 

00:10:52.589 --> 00:10:53.750
so very powerful very verbose debugging
tool

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:53.760
tool
 

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.760
tool
what we've done is actually we brought

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:55.770
what we've done is actually we brought
 

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:59.180
what we've done is actually we brought
logcat inside unity so you don't have to

00:10:59.180 --> 00:10:59.190
logcat inside unity so you don't have to
 

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:01.490
logcat inside unity so you don't have to
do any command-line tool and it's also

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:01.500
do any command-line tool and it's also
 

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.650
do any command-line tool and it's also
super useful because we give you a lot

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:03.660
super useful because we give you a lot
 

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:05.449
super useful because we give you a lot
of information that you can filter and

00:11:05.449 --> 00:11:05.459
of information that you can filter and
 

00:11:05.459 --> 00:11:07.639
of information that you can filter and
look through so I have a little scenario

00:11:07.639 --> 00:11:07.649
look through so I have a little scenario
 

00:11:07.649 --> 00:11:11.960
look through so I have a little scenario
here so this is a lock at window running

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:11.970
here so this is a lock at window running
 

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:14.540
here so this is a lock at window running
inside unity so once you've connected a

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:14.550
inside unity so once you've connected a
 

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:16.760
inside unity so once you've connected a
phone you're gonna start seeing all a

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:16.770
phone you're gonna start seeing all a
 

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:19.730
phone you're gonna start seeing all a
lot cat event coming to unity and of

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:19.740
lot cat event coming to unity and of
 

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:21.889
lot cat event coming to unity and of
course that's maybe a little too much so

00:11:21.889 --> 00:11:21.899
course that's maybe a little too much so
 

00:11:21.899 --> 00:11:23.120
course that's maybe a little too much so
the first thing I'm going to do is

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:23.130
the first thing I'm going to do is
 

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:26.079
the first thing I'm going to do is
filter and I'm gonna filter by the

00:11:26.079 --> 00:11:26.089
filter and I'm gonna filter by the
 

00:11:26.089 --> 00:11:28.250
filter and I'm gonna filter by the
application that's running on the device

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:28.260
application that's running on the device
 

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.769
application that's running on the device
so I've deployed this little game and so

00:11:30.769 --> 00:11:30.779
so I've deployed this little game and so
 

00:11:30.779 --> 00:11:33.050
so I've deployed this little game and so
I'm gonna just select this one and now

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:33.060
I'm gonna just select this one and now
 

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:37.160
I'm gonna just select this one and now
the logcat gives me only the events that

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:37.170
the logcat gives me only the events that
 

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:39.500
the logcat gives me only the events that
are generated by this application so in

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:39.510
are generated by this application so in
 

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:42.019
are generated by this application so in
this case this is the legal cat game and

00:11:42.019 --> 00:11:42.029
this case this is the legal cat game and
 

00:11:42.029 --> 00:11:44.480
this case this is the legal cat game and
as you can see at the bottom the deck of

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:44.490
as you can see at the bottom the deck of
 

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:47.329
as you can see at the bottom the deck of
card is empty and obviously something

00:11:47.329 --> 00:11:47.339
card is empty and obviously something
 

00:11:47.339 --> 00:11:50.060
card is empty and obviously something
wrong happened and yes this is a game

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:50.070
wrong happened and yes this is a game
 

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:52.519
wrong happened and yes this is a game
that's using asset bundles that are

00:11:52.519 --> 00:11:52.529
that's using asset bundles that are
 

00:11:52.529 --> 00:11:56.030
that's using asset bundles that are
hosted somewhere else and I forgot to

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:56.040
hosted somewhere else and I forgot to
 

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.250
hosted somewhere else and I forgot to
make my bill to build my asset so the

00:11:58.250 --> 00:11:58.260
make my bill to build my asset so the
 

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.620
make my bill to build my asset so the
game starts try to download the assets

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:00.630
game starts try to download the assets
 

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:03.380
game starts try to download the assets
the assets are not here it generates

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:03.390
the assets are not here it generates
 

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:05.569
the assets are not here it generates
errors that you can see directly in

00:12:05.569 --> 00:12:05.579
errors that you can see directly in
 

00:12:05.579 --> 00:12:08.540
errors that you can see directly in
logcat so in that case I can detect very

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:08.550
logcat so in that case I can detect very
 

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:11.060
logcat so in that case I can detect very
quickly what's going wrong and then fix

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:11.070
quickly what's going wrong and then fix
 

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:13.220
quickly what's going wrong and then fix
it really quickly and by the way the

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:13.230
it really quickly and by the way the
 

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:15.530
it really quickly and by the way the
screenshot is also taken directly from

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:15.540
screenshot is also taken directly from
 

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:18.170
screenshot is also taken directly from
unity there's a little button here

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:18.180
unity there's a little button here
 

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:20.120
unity there's a little button here
capture screen is going to take a

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:20.130
capture screen is going to take a
 

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:21.800
capture screen is going to take a
screenshot of what's running on the

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:21.810
screenshot of what's running on the
 

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:23.720
screenshot of what's running on the
device and you can save it locally on

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:23.730
device and you can save it locally on
 

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:26.240
device and you can save it locally on
your machine small feature but super

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:26.250
your machine small feature but super
 

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:33.139
your machine small feature but super
convenient so now when you deploy to

00:12:33.139 --> 00:12:33.149
convenient so now when you deploy to
 

00:12:33.149 --> 00:12:37.220
convenient so now when you deploy to
your device you always you know try and

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:37.230
your device you always you know try and
 

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:39.170
your device you always you know try and
then you want to make a change so we've

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:39.180
then you want to make a change so we've
 

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:42.710
then you want to make a change so we've
introduced a new feature in unity 19 one

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:42.720
introduced a new feature in unity 19 one
 

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.440
introduced a new feature in unity 19 one
for Android that allows you to do super

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:45.450
for Android that allows you to do super
 

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:49.100
for Android that allows you to do super
fast iteration on code so here is a

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:49.110
fast iteration on code so here is a
 

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:52.790
fast iteration on code so here is a
scenario so the video just started so we

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:52.800
scenario so the video just started so we
 

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.670
scenario so the video just started so we
make a bill so we have a little sample

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:55.680
make a bill so we have a little sample
 

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.740
make a bill so we have a little sample
game you may have seen it this is one we

00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:57.750
game you may have seen it this is one we
 

00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:00.730
game you may have seen it this is one we
were using in our teaching material and

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:00.740
were using in our teaching material and
 

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:04.310
were using in our teaching material and
infinite runner so the first bill takes

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.320
infinite runner so the first bill takes
 

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.950
infinite runner so the first bill takes
about a minute it was a little

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:06.960
about a minute it was a little
 

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:10.940
about a minute it was a little
so the score start at zero and I like to

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:10.950
so the score start at zero and I like to
 

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:13.010
so the score start at zero and I like to
cheat so what I'm gonna do I want to do

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:13.020
cheat so what I'm gonna do I want to do
 

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:15.110
cheat so what I'm gonna do I want to do
I'm gonna change the code and start the

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:15.120
I'm gonna change the code and start the
 

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.570
I'm gonna change the code and start the
game at ten so I'm go going to the code

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:17.580
game at ten so I'm go going to the code
 

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:20.480
game at ten so I'm go going to the code
gonna do a little quick change and at

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:20.490
gonna do a little quick change and at
 

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:22.700
gonna do a little quick change and at
this point you know I don't want to

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:22.710
this point you know I don't want to
 

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:24.769
this point you know I don't want to
rebuild the whole game so what I'm gonna

00:13:24.769 --> 00:13:24.779
rebuild the whole game so what I'm gonna
 

00:13:24.779 --> 00:13:26.900
rebuild the whole game so what I'm gonna
do I'm gonna use this option script only

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:26.910
do I'm gonna use this option script only
 

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.780
do I'm gonna use this option script only
so I'm gonna recon by just a code and

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:29.790
so I'm gonna recon by just a code and
 

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:32.720
so I'm gonna recon by just a code and
not touch any asset I'm gonna ask unity

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:32.730
not touch any asset I'm gonna ask unity
 

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:33.199
not touch any asset I'm gonna ask unity
okay

00:13:33.199 --> 00:13:33.209
okay
 

00:13:33.209 --> 00:13:36.440
okay
rebuild the code recompile the code and

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:36.450
rebuild the code recompile the code and
 

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:39.170
rebuild the code recompile the code and
just push the new library and so in this

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:39.180
just push the new library and so in this
 

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:41.660
just push the new library and so in this
case I don't even rebuild a new apk

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:41.670
case I don't even rebuild a new apk
 

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:44.510
case I don't even rebuild a new apk
I just recombine my library push it to

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:44.520
I just recombine my library push it to
 

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.120
I just recombine my library push it to
the device and it takes 18 second

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:47.130
the device and it takes 18 second
 

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:49.160
the device and it takes 18 second
instead of one minute and as you can see

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:49.170
instead of one minute and as you can see
 

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:51.980
instead of one minute and as you can see
when I restart the game the game will

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:51.990
when I restart the game the game will
 

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:54.710
when I restart the game the game will
look for the new library and check into

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720
look for the new library and check into
 

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.630
look for the new library and check into
in account and then as you can see I

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:56.640
in account and then as you can see I
 

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.000
in account and then as you can see I
cheated now I'm starting with ten points

00:13:59.000 --> 00:13:59.010
cheated now I'm starting with ten points
 

00:13:59.010 --> 00:13:59.780
cheated now I'm starting with ten points
ahead

00:13:59.780 --> 00:13:59.790
ahead
 

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:02.840

it's available in unity 2019 one that

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:02.850
it's available in unity 2019 one that
 

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:07.010
it's available in unity 2019 one that
shipped last week and that is really

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:07.020
shipped last week and that is really
 

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:08.860
shipped last week and that is really
fast when you want to do a code

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:08.870
fast when you want to do a code
 

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:16.550
fast when you want to do a code
iteration on your code only yeah so

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560
iteration on your code only yeah so
 

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.710
iteration on your code only yeah so
who's doing error development in a room

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720
who's doing error development in a room
 

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:23.440
who's doing error development in a room
a few great so one of the key thing is

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:23.450
a few great so one of the key thing is
 

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:27.920
a few great so one of the key thing is
very focused on our desire to provide

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:27.930
very focused on our desire to provide
 

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:30.350
very focused on our desire to provide
cross-platform support we've brought a

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:30.360
cross-platform support we've brought a
 

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.390
cross-platform support we've brought a
our foundation which is a new layer in

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:32.400
our foundation which is a new layer in
 

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:33.860
our foundation which is a new layer in
unity that really gives that

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:33.870
unity that really gives that
 

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:38.030
unity that really gives that
cross-platform feature across iOS and

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:38.040
cross-platform feature across iOS and
 

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:41.120
cross-platform feature across iOS and
Android but also what we're doing is by

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:41.130
Android but also what we're doing is by
 

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:44.480
Android but also what we're doing is by
giving you this kind of common API to do

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:44.490
giving you this kind of common API to do
 

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:46.130
giving you this kind of common API to do
all the common things we're also

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:46.140
all the common things we're also
 

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:49.310
all the common things we're also
providing some extensions so that every

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:49.320
providing some extensions so that every
 

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.819
providing some extensions so that every
platform that has some specific features

00:14:51.819 --> 00:14:51.829
platform that has some specific features
 

00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:54.620
platform that has some specific features
brought directly to you so you have them

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:54.630
brought directly to you so you have them
 

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:56.569
brought directly to you so you have them
right in unity but for all the common

00:14:56.569 --> 00:14:56.579
right in unity but for all the common
 

00:14:56.579 --> 00:14:59.120
right in unity but for all the common
things you'll have to worry about the

00:14:59.120 --> 00:14:59.130
things you'll have to worry about the
 

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:02.180
things you'll have to worry about the
differences between those platforms so

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:02.190
differences between those platforms so
 

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:05.840
differences between those platforms so
the first thing next we are introducing

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:05.850
the first thing next we are introducing
 

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:09.470
the first thing next we are introducing
in 19:1 a set of features the first one

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:09.480
in 19:1 a set of features the first one
 

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.949
in 19:1 a set of features the first one
is the possibility to record a session

00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959
is the possibility to record a session
 

00:15:12.959 --> 00:15:15.920
is the possibility to record a session
so if you are playing with your app that

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:15.930
so if you are playing with your app that
 

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:18.769
so if you are playing with your app that
you've built and exploring the world you

00:15:18.769 --> 00:15:18.779
you've built and exploring the world you
 

00:15:18.779 --> 00:15:20.290
you've built and exploring the world you
can record all the

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:20.300
can record all the
 

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.450
can record all the
that happen and replay that replay that

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:22.460
that happen and replay that replay that
 

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:25.240
that happen and replay that replay that
session and use it for example as the

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:25.250
session and use it for example as the
 

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:27.760
session and use it for example as the
test script for further testing for

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:27.770
test script for further testing for
 

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:30.610
test script for further testing for
further tests if you've made some

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:30.620
further tests if you've made some
 

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:34.200
further tests if you've made some
changes to verify everything is okay

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:34.210
changes to verify everything is okay
 

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:37.210
changes to verify everything is okay
next in 19 - we're working on edit or

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:37.220
next in 19 - we're working on edit or
 

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:39.310
next in 19 - we're working on edit or
simulation so in this case you don't

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:39.320
simulation so in this case you don't
 

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:42.370
simulation so in this case you don't
even need to have a device connected to

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:42.380
even need to have a device connected to
 

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:45.010
even need to have a device connected to
the unity editor you can actually

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:45.020
the unity editor you can actually
 

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:47.590
the unity editor you can actually
simulate inputs and a real world around

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:47.600
simulate inputs and a real world around
 

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.260
simulate inputs and a real world around
you so again that's a way to each other

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:50.270
you so again that's a way to each other
 

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:52.060
you so again that's a way to each other
H really fast without even without

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:52.070
H really fast without even without
 

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:55.180
H really fast without even without
having a device connected so I skip the

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:55.190
having a device connected so I skip the
 

00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:58.870
having a device connected so I skip the
air remote because I have a video so the

00:15:58.870 --> 00:15:58.880
air remote because I have a video so the
 

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:02.800
air remote because I have a video so the
air remote is the way to combine the

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:02.810
air remote is the way to combine the
 

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:05.770
air remote is the way to combine the
power of the unity editor and having a

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:05.780
power of the unity editor and having a
 

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:07.960
power of the unity editor and having a
phone connected to your development

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:07.970
phone connected to your development
 

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:10.560
phone connected to your development
machine so in that case the way it works

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:10.570
machine so in that case the way it works
 

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:14.140
machine so in that case the way it works
you connect your phone to the unity

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:14.150
you connect your phone to the unity
 

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:16.630
you connect your phone to the unity
editor and then the phone is streaming

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:16.640
editor and then the phone is streaming
 

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:19.090
editor and then the phone is streaming
the world to the editor and all the

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:19.100
the world to the editor and all the
 

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.490
the world to the editor and all the
information location plane detection and

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:21.500
information location plane detection and
 

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.730
information location plane detection and
everything and so you end up physically

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:24.740
everything and so you end up physically
 

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:26.920
everything and so you end up physically
working directly in the editor but you

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:26.930
working directly in the editor but you
 

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:28.450
working directly in the editor but you
have the phone that is acting as the

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:28.460
have the phone that is acting as the
 

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:30.010
have the phone that is acting as the
device capturing the world so you can

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:30.020
device capturing the world so you can
 

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:32.440
device capturing the world so you can
iterate really fast and test and do a

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:32.450
iterate really fast and test and do a
 

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:34.510
iterate really fast and test and do a
lot of testing without having to build

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:34.520
lot of testing without having to build
 

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:36.640
lot of testing without having to build
and then wait for the bill to be ready

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:36.650
and then wait for the bill to be ready
 

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:38.410
and then wait for the bill to be ready
and play with the phone so we can really

00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:38.420
and play with the phone so we can really
 

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:40.360
and play with the phone so we can really
combine that and that's super powerful

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:40.370
combine that and that's super powerful
 

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:46.930
combine that and that's super powerful
to iterate very fast so let's talk about

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:46.940
to iterate very fast so let's talk about
 

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:52.520
to iterate very fast so let's talk about
graphics

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:52.530
 
 

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:55.910
 
as I said earlier unity was created more

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920
as I said earlier unity was created more
 

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:59.690
as I said earlier unity was created more
than ten years ago and when we made the

00:16:59.690 --> 00:16:59.700
than ten years ago and when we made the
 

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:02.000
than ten years ago and when we made the
first iteration of unity we've built a

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:02.010
first iteration of unity we've built a
 

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:04.940
first iteration of unity we've built a
really powerful graphics engine but we

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:04.950
really powerful graphics engine but we
 

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:06.830
really powerful graphics engine but we
also built it in a way that's fairly

00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:06.840
also built it in a way that's fairly
 

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:09.410
also built it in a way that's fairly
black box in the sense that there is not

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:09.420
black box in the sense that there is not
 

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:13.610
black box in the sense that there is not
a lot of hooks to tweak it to really get

00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:13.620
a lot of hooks to tweak it to really get
 

00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:15.320
a lot of hooks to tweak it to really get
the engine to go any direction you want

00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:15.330
the engine to go any direction you want
 

00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:18.590
the engine to go any direction you want
so couple years ago we started thinking

00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:18.600
so couple years ago we started thinking
 

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:21.560
so couple years ago we started thinking
about a new rendering engine and we

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:21.570
about a new rendering engine and we
 

00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:25.010
about a new rendering engine and we
built this new engine with the idea that

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:25.020
built this new engine with the idea that
 

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:27.380
built this new engine with the idea that
we want to give you a lot of power a lot

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:27.390
we want to give you a lot of power a lot
 

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:30.050
we want to give you a lot of power a lot
of control and also a lot of flexibility

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:30.060
of control and also a lot of flexibility
 

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:32.690
of control and also a lot of flexibility
so what we've done is basically created

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:32.700
so what we've done is basically created
 

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:36.140
so what we've done is basically created
the core of the rendering pipeline that

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:36.150
the core of the rendering pipeline that
 

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:40.790
the core of the rendering pipeline that
is built in C++ and around that core we

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:40.800
is built in C++ and around that core we
 

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.070
is built in C++ and around that core we
have a series of scripts that are

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:43.080
have a series of scripts that are
 

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.020
have a series of scripts that are
written in c-sharp that will take care

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:45.030
written in c-sharp that will take care
 

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:47.330
written in c-sharp that will take care
of all the steps that are happening in

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:47.340
of all the steps that are happening in
 

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:49.790
of all the steps that are happening in
the rendering pipeline so that we give

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:49.800
the rendering pipeline so that we give
 

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.590
the rendering pipeline so that we give
you full control of the rendering

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600
you full control of the rendering
 

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.780
you full control of the rendering
pipeline but on the other hand your

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:53.790
pipeline but on the other hand your
 

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:56.450
pipeline but on the other hand your
responsibility is limited to writing

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:56.460
responsibility is limited to writing
 

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:59.540
responsibility is limited to writing
code in c-sharp and having to choose the

00:17:59.540 --> 00:17:59.550
code in c-sharp and having to choose the
 

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:01.940
code in c-sharp and having to choose the
different steps you want so you can have

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:01.950
different steps you want so you can have
 

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:04.100
different steps you want so you can have
a really customized rendering process to

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:04.110
a really customized rendering process to
 

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:07.160
a really customized rendering process to
control resource usage you can control

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:07.170
control resource usage you can control
 

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:10.490
control resource usage you can control
performance and that is all ungrateful

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:10.500
performance and that is all ungrateful
 

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.320
performance and that is all ungrateful
people that from Cisco who likes to

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:12.330
people that from Cisco who likes to
 

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:15.680
people that from Cisco who likes to
create rendering pipeline but out of the

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:15.690
create rendering pipeline but out of the
 

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:18.200
create rendering pipeline but out of the
box we give you to run run pipelines

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:18.210
box we give you to run run pipelines
 

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:22.160
box we give you to run run pipelines
that are ready to use and the first one

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:22.170
that are ready to use and the first one
 

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:23.450
that are ready to use and the first one
that we call lightweight run your

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:23.460
that we call lightweight run your
 

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:25.760

pipeline is actually out of preview so

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:25.770
pipeline is actually out of preview so
 

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:29.060

final in unity 19 1 and this is

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:29.070
final in unity 19 1 and this is
 

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:31.250
final in unity 19 1 and this is
basically the the more Universal

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:31.260
basically the the more Universal
 

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:34.430

pipeline that is design with performance

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:34.440
pipeline that is design with performance
 

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:36.770
pipeline that is design with performance
in mind and that will work really well

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:36.780
in mind and that will work really well
 

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:39.350
in mind and that will work really well
across all platforms there's a big focus

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360
across all platforms there's a big focus
 

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.840
across all platforms there's a big focus
on making that pipeline super efficient

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:41.850
on making that pipeline super efficient
 

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:44.900
on making that pipeline super efficient
on mobile but also it's really easy to

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:44.910
on mobile but also it's really easy to
 

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:47.480
on mobile but also it's really easy to
configure this pipeline to add extra

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:47.490
configure this pipeline to add extra
 

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:49.520
configure this pipeline to add extra
post-processing or to remove

post-processing or to remove
 

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:51.740
post-processing or to remove
post-processing or to have you to add

your custom steps if you want to do

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:54.540
your custom steps if you want to do
 

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:57.890
your custom steps if you want to do
special things during the rendering

00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:57.900
special things during the rendering
 

00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.900
special things during the rendering
pipeline so this is the one that is

00:18:59.900 --> 00:18:59.910
pipeline so this is the one that is
 

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:03.080
pipeline so this is the one that is
really recommended for mobile and when

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:03.090
really recommended for mobile and when
 

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:04.610
really recommended for mobile and when
those are annoying pipeline which is

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:04.620
those are annoying pipeline which is
 

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:06.659
those are annoying pipeline which is
called high definition render

00:19:06.659 --> 00:19:06.669
called high definition render
 

00:19:06.669 --> 00:19:09.440
called high definition render
which is basically the one we use for

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:09.450
which is basically the one we use for
 

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:12.480
which is basically the one we use for
games that designed to run on PC console

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:12.490
games that designed to run on PC console
 

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:14.310

exclusively that's the pipeline that is

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:14.320
exclusively that's the pipeline that is
 

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:17.210
exclusively that's the pipeline that is
used in film when we want to do

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:17.220
used in film when we want to do
 

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:19.890
used in film when we want to do
simulation so unity has being used to do

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:19.900
simulation so unity has being used to do
 

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:24.750

know if it's a real one or a fake one

00:19:29.159 --> 00:19:29.169
know if it's a real one or a fake one
 

00:19:29.169 --> 00:19:31.770
know if it's a real one or a fake one
and that's the the run writing pipeline

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:31.780
and that's the the run writing pipeline
 

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:33.299
and that's the the run writing pipeline
that's being used for those and the main

00:19:33.299 --> 00:19:33.309
that's being used for those and the main
 

00:19:33.309 --> 00:19:35.520
that's being used for those and the main
difference is that the high-definition

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:35.530
difference is that the high-definition
 

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:37.799
difference is that the high-definition
run or pipeline is actually heavily

00:19:37.799 --> 00:19:37.809
run or pipeline is actually heavily
 

00:19:37.809 --> 00:19:40.500
run or pipeline is actually heavily
relying on the GPU compute processing

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:40.510
relying on the GPU compute processing
 

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:44.520
relying on the GPU compute processing
which is somehow available on mobile but

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:44.530
which is somehow available on mobile but
 

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:46.409
which is somehow available on mobile but
not on all mobile for sure and even on

high-end mobile has some limitation so

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:49.750
high-end mobile has some limitation so

you is basically at runtime you can

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:11.080
you is basically at runtime you can

you is basically at runtime you can
decide to reduce a little bit the

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:13.510
decide to reduce a little bit the
 

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:16.110
decide to reduce a little bit the
resolution at which you are rendering so

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:16.120
resolution at which you are rendering so
 

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:18.029
resolution at which you are rendering so
that you can really save on bandwidth on

00:20:18.029 --> 00:20:18.039
that you can really save on bandwidth on
 

00:20:18.039 --> 00:20:21.029
that you can really save on bandwidth on
the GPU and on the CPU and on memory and

the GPU and on the CPU and on memory and
 

00:20:21.039 --> 00:20:24.180
the GPU and on the CPU and on memory and
you just reduce by a few percent your

you just reduce by a few percent your
 

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:26.970
you just reduce by a few percent your
resolution and you blip to the full

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:26.980
resolution and you blip to the full
 

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:30.570

actually by default when you create a
new project it's gonna be Vulcan the

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:48.340
new project it's gonna be Vulcan the

of course you can decide to choose
 

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:56.130
of course you can decide to choose
something different but we truly believe

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:56.140
something different but we truly believe
 

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:58.560
something different but we truly believe
that Vulcan is at the stage where it is

00:20:58.560 --> 00:20:58.570
that Vulcan is at the stage where it is
 

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:02.279
that Vulcan is at the stage where it is
seriously as a good solution especially

00:21:02.279 --> 00:21:02.289
seriously as a good solution especially
 

00:21:02.289 --> 00:21:06.480
seriously as a good solution especially
for the latest devices I wanted to

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:06.490
for the latest devices I wanted to
 

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:08.700
for the latest devices I wanted to
mention also a feature that it's called

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:08.710
mention also a feature that it's called
 

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:11.399
mention also a feature that it's called
optimized frame pacing and that's a

00:21:11.399 --> 00:21:11.409
optimized frame pacing and that's a
 

00:21:11.409 --> 00:21:13.380
optimized frame pacing and that's a
feature that actually has been developed

feature that actually has been developed
 

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:15.779
feature that actually has been developed
by Google that we've integrated inside

00:21:15.779 --> 00:21:15.789
by Google that we've integrated inside
 

00:21:15.789 --> 00:21:18.539
by Google that we've integrated inside
unity so what it does basically it

00:21:18.539 --> 00:21:18.549
unity so what it does basically it
 

00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:19.769
unity so what it does basically it
provides a better

00:21:19.769 --> 00:21:19.779
provides a better
 

00:21:19.779 --> 00:21:22.169
provides a better
orchestration of the distribution of the

the frames for the game and Android is a

00:21:27.509 --> 00:21:27.519
the frames for the game and Android is a
 

00:21:27.519 --> 00:21:30.779
the frames for the game and Android is a
pretty complex operating system and this

00:21:30.779 --> 00:21:30.789
pretty complex operating system and this
 

00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:33.899

more smooth and so that's for me the
 

00:21:37.149 --> 00:21:39.479
more smooth and so that's for me the
opportunity to highlight the partnership

00:21:39.479 --> 00:21:39.489
opportunity to highlight the partnership
 

00:21:39.489 --> 00:21:44.009
opportunity to highlight the partnership
that unity and Google have been having

00:21:44.009 --> 00:21:44.019
that unity and Google have been having
 

00:21:44.019 --> 00:21:46.349
that unity and Google have been having
for four years now and really we work

00:21:46.349 --> 00:21:46.359
for four years now and really we work
 

00:21:46.359 --> 00:21:49.080

super closely to make sure unity works
 

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:53.219
super closely to make sure unity works
well on Android but also Google is

00:21:53.219 --> 00:21:53.229
well on Android but also Google is
 

00:21:53.229 --> 00:21:56.190
well on Android but also Google is
listening to us game engine creators

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:56.200
listening to us game engine creators
 

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.219

discussion and hopefully you'll get the
 

00:22:06.609 --> 00:22:09.109
discussion and hopefully you'll get the
benefits as game creators of all those

00:22:09.109 --> 00:22:09.119
benefits as game creators of all those
 

00:22:09.119 --> 00:22:14.269

at the end of this talk there's a lot
more hands that will go up in the near

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:16.510
more hands that will go up in the near
 

00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:19.139
more hands that will go up in the near
future so what is an Android app bundle

00:25:19.139 --> 00:25:19.149
future so what is an Android app bundle
 

00:25:19.149 --> 00:25:22.080
future so what is an Android app bundle
so Android app bundles are an awesome

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:22.090
so Android app bundles are an awesome
 

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:24.210
so Android app bundles are an awesome
tool that save you from having to manage

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:24.220
tool that save you from having to manage
 

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:27.840
tool that save you from having to manage
multiple apks or from having to kind of

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:27.850
multiple apks or from having to kind of
 

00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:31.139
multiple apks or from having to kind of
put all your stuff into one apk and keep

00:25:31.139 --> 00:25:31.149
put all your stuff into one apk and keep
 

00:25:31.149 --> 00:25:33.120
put all your stuff into one apk and keep
it under some kind of size limit to

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:33.130
it under some kind of size limit to
 

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:34.590
it under some kind of size limit to
support all these different device

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:34.600
support all these different device
 

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:37.649
support all these different device
configurations so for example you either

00:25:37.649 --> 00:25:37.659
configurations so for example you either
 

00:25:37.659 --> 00:25:40.230
configurations so for example you either
have to have multiple apks one for the

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:40.240
have to have multiple apks one for the
 

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.820
have to have multiple apks one for the
different architectures that are out

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:41.830
different architectures that are out
 

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:44.430
different architectures that are out
there x86 arm you might have multiple

00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:44.440
there x86 arm you might have multiple
 

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:46.720
there x86 arm you might have multiple
apks for high resolution asset

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:46.730
apks for high resolution asset
 

00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:49.450
apks for high resolution asset
on an apk for low resolution assets or

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:49.460
on an apk for low resolution assets or
 

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:50.770
on an apk for low resolution assets or
you're trying to fit all that together

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:50.780
you're trying to fit all that together
 

00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:53.620
you're trying to fit all that together
into one Universal apk that fits all

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:53.630
into one Universal apk that fits all
 

00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:56.500
into one Universal apk that fits all
devices and so what Apple does let you

00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:56.510
devices and so what Apple does let you
 

00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:59.710
devices and so what Apple does let you
do is instead of building these multiple

00:25:59.710 --> 00:25:59.720
do is instead of building these multiple
 

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:03.070
do is instead of building these multiple
apks or fitting it all into one you

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:03.080
apks or fitting it all into one you
 

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.080
apks or fitting it all into one you
build an app bundle which has everything

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:05.090
build an app bundle which has everything
 

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:07.299
build an app bundle which has everything
needed for your game to run across all

00:26:07.299 --> 00:26:07.309
needed for your game to run across all
 

00:26:07.309 --> 00:26:10.060
needed for your game to run across all
these different devices and then instead

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:10.070
these different devices and then instead
 

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:12.220
these different devices and then instead
of uploading an apk to Google Play you

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:12.230
of uploading an apk to Google Play you
 

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:14.799
of uploading an apk to Google Play you
upload the app bundle and what Google

00:26:14.799 --> 00:26:14.809
upload the app bundle and what Google
 

00:26:14.809 --> 00:26:16.480
upload the app bundle and what Google
Play is going to do on the back end is

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:16.490
Play is going to do on the back end is
 

00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:18.789
Play is going to do on the back end is
basically take your app bundle and it's

00:26:18.789 --> 00:26:18.799
basically take your app bundle and it's
 

00:26:18.799 --> 00:26:21.010
basically take your app bundle and it's
going to generate and sign and

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:21.020
going to generate and sign and
 

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:24.520
going to generate and sign and
distribute an optimized apk specifically

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:24.530
distribute an optimized apk specifically
 

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:26.890
distribute an optimized apk specifically
for the device that somebody's playing

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:26.900
for the device that somebody's playing
 

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:28.900
for the device that somebody's playing
on so for example if somebody's coming

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:28.910
on so for example if somebody's coming
 

00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:30.100
on so for example if somebody's coming
along and they want to download your

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:30.110
along and they want to download your
 

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:32.710
along and they want to download your
game on an x86 device they're only going

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:32.720
game on an x86 device they're only going
 

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:35.440
game on an x86 device they're only going
to get the x86 versions of your native

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:35.450
to get the x86 versions of your native
 

00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:37.150
to get the x86 versions of your native
libraries and they won't get the arm

00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:37.160
libraries and they won't get the arm
 

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:39.640
libraries and they won't get the arm
versions there so it saves a lot of

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:39.650
versions there so it saves a lot of
 

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:43.180
versions there so it saves a lot of
space on the user's end as well and

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:43.190
space on the user's end as well and
 

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:45.700
space on the user's end as well and
another cool aspect of Android app

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:45.710
another cool aspect of Android app
 

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:47.560
another cool aspect of Android app
bundles is that right now on the App

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:47.570
bundles is that right now on the App
 

00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:50.919
bundles is that right now on the App
Store on Google Play if you upload an

00:26:50.919 --> 00:26:50.929
Store on Google Play if you upload an
 

00:26:50.929 --> 00:26:53.230
Store on Google Play if you upload an
apk you have to keep it under 100

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:53.240
apk you have to keep it under 100
 

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.740
apk you have to keep it under 100
megabyte unless if you're over 100

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:56.750
megabyte unless if you're over 100
 

00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:58.990
megabyte unless if you're over 100
megabytes you have to use extension file

00:26:58.990 --> 00:26:59.000
megabytes you have to use extension file
 

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.419
megabytes you have to use extension file
expansion files with app bundles you can

00:27:01.419 --> 00:27:01.429
expansion files with app bundles you can
 

00:27:01.429 --> 00:27:02.919
expansion files with app bundles you can
actually we've increased that limit to

00:27:02.919 --> 00:27:02.929
actually we've increased that limit to
 

00:27:02.929 --> 00:27:06.070
actually we've increased that limit to
150 megabytes so there's a lot of

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:06.080
150 megabytes so there's a lot of
 

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.289
150 megabytes so there's a lot of
benefits using app bundles and appear to

00:27:08.289 --> 00:27:08.299
benefits using app bundles and appear to
 

00:27:08.299 --> 00:27:11.890
benefits using app bundles and appear to
specifically show how easy it is in

00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:11.900
specifically show how easy it is in
 

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.260
specifically show how easy it is in
unity to do this and why you should be

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:14.270
unity to do this and why you should be
 

00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:16.330
unity to do this and why you should be
totally using it so the the idea behind

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:16.340
totally using it so the the idea behind
 

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:18.610
totally using it so the the idea behind
app bundles is all of these benefits and

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:18.620
app bundles is all of these benefits and
 

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:20.470
app bundles is all of these benefits and
saving you the hassle of managing all

00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:20.480
saving you the hassle of managing all
 

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.570
saving you the hassle of managing all
these multiple apks with none of the

00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:22.580
these multiple apks with none of the
 

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:25.390
these multiple apks with none of the
overhead so if you're using unity mm

00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:25.400
overhead so if you're using unity mm
 

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.159
overhead so if you're using unity mm
18.3 and above

00:27:27.159 --> 00:27:27.169
18.3 and above
 

00:27:27.169 --> 00:27:29.110
18.3 and above
app bundles are super simple to build

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:29.120
app bundles are super simple to build
 

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:31.780
app bundles are super simple to build
I'll show you in a second or if you're

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:31.790
I'll show you in a second or if you're
 

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:33.690
I'll show you in a second or if you're
potentially exporting to Android studio

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:33.700
potentially exporting to Android studio
 

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:35.919
potentially exporting to Android studio
if you're using Android studio 3 points

00:27:35.919 --> 00:27:35.929
if you're using Android studio 3 points
 

00:27:35.929 --> 00:27:37.960
if you're using Android studio 3 points
2 and above it's just the build option

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:37.970
2 and above it's just the build option
 

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:41.730
2 and above it's just the build option
to build an app bundle instead of an apk

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:41.740
to build an app bundle instead of an apk
 

00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:44.500
to build an app bundle instead of an apk
so in unity out-of-the-box what you're

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:44.510
so in unity out-of-the-box what you're
 

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:46.270
so in unity out-of-the-box what you're
going to get as I mentioned before is

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:46.280
going to get as I mentioned before is
 

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:48.000
going to get as I mentioned before is
when you build an Android app bundle

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:48.010
when you build an Android app bundle
 

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:50.650
when you build an Android app bundle
unity is going to generate it and it's

00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:50.660
unity is going to generate it and it's
 

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:53.380
unity is going to generate it and it's
going to allow you to basically provide

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:53.390
going to allow you to basically provide
 

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:56.560
going to allow you to basically provide
optimized builds for different native

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:56.570
optimized builds for different native
 

00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:58.090
optimized builds for different native
library and running on different

00:27:58.090 --> 00:27:58.100
library and running on different
 

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:00.669
library and running on different
architectures so you're going to get

00:28:00.669 --> 00:28:00.679
architectures so you're going to get
 

00:28:00.679 --> 00:28:03.039
architectures so you're going to get
before and 32-bit arm support as well as

00:28:03.039 --> 00:28:03.049
before and 32-bit arm support as well as
 

00:28:03.049 --> 00:28:06.489
before and 32-bit arm support as well as
x86 native library support now you can

00:28:06.489 --> 00:28:06.499
x86 native library support now you can
 

00:28:06.499 --> 00:28:08.350
x86 native library support now you can
also if you set up your game to have

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:08.360
also if you set up your game to have
 

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.029
also if you set up your game to have
your localization files and kind of a

00:28:10.029 --> 00:28:10.039
your localization files and kind of a
 

00:28:10.039 --> 00:28:13.299
your localization files and kind of a
standard layout you can use a post build

00:28:13.299 --> 00:28:13.309
standard layout you can use a post build
 

00:28:13.309 --> 00:28:15.700
standard layout you can use a post build
process to also build those files into

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:15.710
process to also build those files into
 

00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:17.680
process to also build those files into
your app bundle such that if somebody's

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:17.690
your app bundle such that if somebody's
 

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:19.389
your app bundle such that if somebody's
playing in Spanish don't only get the

00:28:19.389 --> 00:28:19.399
playing in Spanish don't only get the
 

00:28:19.399 --> 00:28:20.919
playing in Spanish don't only get the
Spanish for localization files and

00:28:20.919 --> 00:28:20.929
Spanish for localization files and
 

00:28:20.929 --> 00:28:22.840
Spanish for localization files and
vice-versa that's not supported out of

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:22.850
vice-versa that's not supported out of
 

00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:24.940
vice-versa that's not supported out of
the box yet in unity but it's easy to do

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:24.950
the box yet in unity but it's easy to do
 

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:28.840
the box yet in unity but it's easy to do
after the fact so as I said in unity

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:28.850
after the fact so as I said in unity
 

00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:31.899
after the fact so as I said in unity
it's super simple you just in your build

00:28:31.899 --> 00:28:31.909
it's super simple you just in your build
 

00:28:31.909 --> 00:28:34.090
it's super simple you just in your build
build settings you just click that box

00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:34.100
build settings you just click that box
 

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:36.279
build settings you just click that box
right there build an app bundle unity is

00:28:36.279 --> 00:28:36.289
right there build an app bundle unity is
 

00:28:36.289 --> 00:28:38.470
right there build an app bundle unity is
going to generate the app bundle and you

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:38.480
going to generate the app bundle and you
 

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.239
going to generate the app bundle and you
can upload that directly to Google Play

00:28:40.239 --> 00:28:40.249
can upload that directly to Google Play
 

00:28:40.249 --> 00:28:42.999
can upload that directly to Google Play
with no extra work required on your end

00:28:42.999 --> 00:28:43.009
with no extra work required on your end
 

00:28:43.009 --> 00:28:46.060
with no extra work required on your end
if you click build and run what unity is

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:46.070
if you click build and run what unity is
 

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:47.590
if you click build and run what unity is
gonna do is it's gonna generate that app

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:47.600
gonna do is it's gonna generate that app
 

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.269
gonna do is it's gonna generate that app
bundle and then it's gonna generate a

00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:49.279
bundle and then it's gonna generate a
 

00:28:49.279 --> 00:28:51.909
bundle and then it's gonna generate a
temporary apk that you can test locally

00:28:51.909 --> 00:28:51.919
temporary apk that you can test locally

and you can enable this size
 

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:20.320
and you can enable this size
notification and what unity is gonna do

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:20.330
notification and what unity is gonna do
 

00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:23.710
notification and what unity is gonna do
is if it's a text your app bundle is

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:23.720
is if it's a text your app bundle is
 

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.509
is if it's a text your app bundle is
gonna be over a certain threshold that

00:29:25.509 --> 00:29:25.519
gonna be over a certain threshold that
 

00:29:25.519 --> 00:29:27.639
gonna be over a certain threshold that
you define it's going to warn you and

00:29:27.639 --> 00:29:27.649
you define it's going to warn you and
 

00:29:27.649 --> 00:29:30.669
you define it's going to warn you and
suggest to basically generate an apk

00:29:30.669 --> 00:29:30.679
suggest to basically generate an apk
 

00:29:30.679 --> 00:29:33.009

from that app bundle and you can be able

00:29:33.009 --> 00:29:33.019
from that app bundle and you can be able
 

00:29:33.019 --> 00:29:35.649
from that app bundle and you can be able
to view what the size of that compressed

00:29:35.649 --> 00:29:35.659
to view what the size of that compressed
 

00:29:35.659 --> 00:29:38.320
to view what the size of that compressed
apk is generated from the app bundle so

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:38.330
apk is generated from the app bundle so
 

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:39.940
apk is generated from the app bundle so
it's a really great tool to kind of keep

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:39.950
it's a really great tool to kind of keep
 

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:41.980
it's a really great tool to kind of keep
you aware of any size limits you might

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:41.990
you aware of any size limits you might
 

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:46.029

uploaded and I'm taking a look at it and
 

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:01.899
uploaded and I'm taking a look at it and
it shows you a lot of information about

00:30:01.899 --> 00:30:01.909
it shows you a lot of information about
 

00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:03.789
it shows you a lot of information about
what your app bundle is currently

00:30:03.789 --> 00:30:03.799
what your app bundle is currently
 

00:30:03.799 --> 00:30:06.369
what your app bundle is currently
configured and things like the amount of

00:30:06.369 --> 00:30:06.379
configured and things like the amount of
 

00:30:06.379 --> 00:30:08.019
configured and things like the amount of
size that you're saving using app

00:30:08.019 --> 00:30:08.029
size that you're saving using app
 

00:30:08.029 --> 00:30:10.090

bundles compared to if you just upload

00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:10.100
bundles compared to if you just upload
 

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:12.460
bundles compared to if you just upload
it in apk and you can see here it's

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:12.470
it in apk and you can see here it's
 

00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:14.320
it in apk and you can see here it's
gonna show all the different AP

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:14.330

based on different screen densities so
again if somebody downloads the game on

00:30:26.289 --> 00:30:26.299
again if somebody downloads the game on
 

00:30:26.299 --> 00:30:28.720
again if somebody downloads the game on
a high density screen they're only gonna

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:28.730
a high density screen they're only gonna
 

00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:30.399
a high density screen they're only gonna
get the high resolution assets and
