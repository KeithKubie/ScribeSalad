&gt;&gt; Stephanie Stillo:
Well, welcome everyone.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.610
We are so happy to see you here
at our Thursdays at Three talks.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.290
So many familiar
faces, which is lovely.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.030
So we are delighted to be able
to host Chet Van Duzer today

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.710
to talk about his new book
about Henricus Martellus

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.830
and the World Map at Yale,

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.180
multispectral imaging
sources and influence.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.250
So this talk gives an account
of a project that's funded

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.440
by the NEH Endowment
for the Humanities

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.390
to make multispectral images of
the world map made by Martellus

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.870
in about 1491, which, of course,

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.270
is held at the Beinecke
Library at Yale.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.650
And this talk will certainly
talk about the necessity

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.130
of these types of
images for scholarship.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.750
As a scholar, Chet is
largely interested in medieval

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.100
and renascence maps, and he
is quite a notable presence

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.400
in the field.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.260
He has an emphasis on
determining the sources

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.150
that cartographers use for text,

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.440
images and geographical
features on maps.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.700
And he's given several really
wonderful talks about this

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.220
at the Library of Congress.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.620
Several of them are
streaming on our website,

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.800
so please do check them out.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.670
He has had several research
fellowships at the Library

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.060
of Congress at Princeton,
John Carter Brown,

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.640
the Huntington Clements Library.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.720
He's also a board member
on the Lazarus Project

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.760
at the University
of Mississippi,

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.970
which provides low-cost access
to multispectral imaging

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.120
to institutions and
researchers around the world.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.070
To say the least, Chet
is a formidable scholar.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.840
And what I admire most about
his work is his ability

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.320
to add just this amazing
historical depth to topics

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.140
that are as wide ranging
as annotations in 15th

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.720
and 16th century thalamic
atlases to medieval images

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.970
of dragons and serpents
on the high seas.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.910
He's really this
sort of amazing voice

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.350
in the history of cartography.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.550
Now, at this point, he
has enough publications

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:36.850
that I'm worried
about the amount

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.730
of sleep he gets
on a regular basis.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.910
But a few of his notable books
are Seeing the World Anew,

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.180
which he cowrote
with John in 2012

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.200
about the Martin
Waldseemuller 1507 world map

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.090
and the 1516 Carta Marina,
Sea Monsters on Medieval

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.000
and Renascence maps from
2014, Apocalyptic Cartography,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.070
how could you not love that
title, absolutely fantastic,

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.840
in 2015, Canada Before
Federation,

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.200
which was a fabulous
book which analyzed

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.680
and contextualized maps
featured in a traveling exhibit

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.700
from 2017, exploring through the
early exploration and mapping

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.280
of Canada, so really lovely.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.900
And now we have this
new book as well.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.470
So again, a formidable
scholar in the field.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.850
We are so happy to
have him here.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.510
So please help me
to welcome Chet.

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.580
[ Applause ]

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.880
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: Well,
thank you all for coming.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.180
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.280
This is a talk about this book,
which is just out from Springer

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.840
and is available for purchase
at the desk to the side there.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.140
And it's a particular pleasure
to present this material here

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.110
because a map that
figures prominently

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.300
in this talk is Martin
Waldseemuller's world map

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.930
of 1507, one of the treasures
of the Library of Congress,

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.800
and the Library's
copy is the only one

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.630
that survives of this map.

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.510
This is the map that will be
the focus of this presentation.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.990
It was made by Henricus
Martellus,

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.200
a German cartographer
working in Florence

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.570
in the second half
of the 15th century.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.930
It surfaced in Bern,
Switzerland in the late 1950s.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.640
There was a flurry
of interest in it,

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.810
a couple of unpublished studies

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.660
that confirmed its
importance and authenticity.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:40.100
And then it was this sort
of great unstudied object

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.130
for about 60 years
because, as I'll show later,

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.830
most of the text on the map
had faded to illegibility.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:54.460
But the map was sold, purchased
and anonymously donated to Yale,

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.640
and it's been in the
Beinecke Library ever since.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.680
I'll begin by looking
at the development

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.620
of Henricus Martellus'
world maps over time,

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.480
and he made manuscripts
of Ptolemy's Geography.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.520
I'll begin with Ptolemy's
Geography.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:17.880
Here we have a folio of a
manuscript of the geography.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.760
The geography consists of
instructions for making maps,

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.440
a large database of place names

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.850
with their latitudes
and longitudes.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.930
And we see here there are
about 8,000 place names

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.310
with their latitudes
and longitudes.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.860
And then in many of the
surviving manuscripts

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.640
in many printed editions
of the work,

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.620
there are the Ptolemy
maps themselves.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.800
This is Ptolemy's
so-called second projection

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.260
for making a world map, so
we'll examine this briefly.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.200
So here's the equator,
tropic of Capricorn,

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.730
so 23 1/2 degrees south
is the southern limit

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.360
of Ptolemy's world map.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.670
Tropic of Cancer about
23 1/2 degrees north.

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.620
And the Arctic Circle at
about 66 1/2 degrees north,

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.480
which is the northern limit
of Ptolemy's world map.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:15.030
The map covers 180 degrees of
longitude, which is to say half

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:16.450
of the Earth's circumference.

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.930
And Ptolemy was very
conscious of the fact

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:23.380
that the map did not include all
of the Earth's circumference.

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:27.090
So if we fix this image,
this diagram, in our mind,

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:32.560
I will now switch to a world
map made using this diagram,

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.210
which we have here.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:38.730
This is a world map in
one of the manuscripts

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:41.840
of Ptolemy's Geography
made by Henricus Martellus.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.630
So this is a world map
by Henricus Martellus.

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:48.120
We don't see a Ptolemaic
world map every day,

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.410
so I'll run through a
few details to orient us.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:58.410
So here we have Europe,
the Mediterranean, Africa,

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:03.520
the Arabian Peninsula, Asia,
and it's important to point

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.190
out that Ptolemy does not know
the eastern coast of Asia.

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:12.830
We did not have water to the
east of the Asian mainland.

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:16.640
The Indian Ocean, the
Island of Taprobana,

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.770
which is generally
identified with Sri Lanka.

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:25.390
We move now to another world
map made by Henricus Martellus.

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:28.950
This is in a manuscript
of his island book,

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:34.090
so a book about the world's
islands illustrated with maps.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:35.990
A few of the manuscripts,
including this one

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:39.240
in the British Library,
include a world map.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:44.070
If we compare this with the
Ptolemaic world map made

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:48.770
by Martellus, so the Ptolemaic
map covers 180 degrees

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:50.110
of longitude.

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:53.070
The map in the island book does
not have a scale of longitude,

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:58.310
but estimating, it covers
about 240 degrees of longitude.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:02.170
I've indicated some
corresponding points on the map.

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:06.390
So what the map in the island
book includes that is not

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:10.670
in the Ptolemaic
map is Eastern Asia.

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:12.440
So and specifically we can see

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:16.450
that now Asia is depicted all
the way to the Eastern Coast.

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:22.300
If we compare this map
with the map at Yale,

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.970
it does have a scale
of longitude and runs

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:28.040
to 280 degrees of longitude

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.130
and again indicating a
corresponding point there,

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:35.480
we can see that what Martellus
has added on this map is more

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:39.430
of the Eastern Ocean,
all the way to Japan.

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:42.140
And if we think about the
fact that we're talking

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:46.180
about the cartographic career
of one person, it's remarkable

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:47.680
that during that career,

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.770
the amount of the Earth's
circumference depicted went

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:52.870
from 180 degrees to 280 degrees.

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:55.870
It's quite a remarkable advance.

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:59.600
And the new material
on this map,

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.200
that is the post-Ptolemaic
material, comes essentially

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.400
from Marco Polo, and it's
actually quite easy to indicate

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.700
with the line, the division

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.260
between those sources
of information.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.710
So the importance of
the Yale Martellus Map.

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:15.740
Why should we study it?

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.330
For three principal reasons.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:21.870
The first is that it very likely
influenced Christopher Columbus'

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:27.330
thinking about the shape of
Asia and the location of Japan.

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.720
That's a bold claim.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:33.100
There are three principal
pieces of evidence for that,

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:34.710
and I'll just mention
one of them which is sort

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:37.620
of the easiest to
convey quickly.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.530
And that is that
Japan is depicted

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:43.730
with its principal access
running north and south,

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:45.340
so it looks like it's at
an angle, but that's just

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.750
because of the map's projection.

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:52.160
And Columbus' son in his
biography of his father,

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.890
says that his father certainly
would have discovered Japan had

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:59.080
he not believed that it had its
principal access running north

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.650
and south.

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:03.700
There is no other document
from this period, that survives

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:07.620
at any rate, that either
says or shows Japan

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.770
with that orientation.

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:14.300
So this is quite strong
evidence that this cartography,

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.140
if not this specific map,
so it's quite possible

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:18.440
and in fact quite likely

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.840
that Martellus made
other similar maps.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.070
So it's not likely that the
Yale map was in Columbus' hand,

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:26.870
but very likely that this
cartography influenced

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:29.170
Columbus' thinking.

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:35.270
It also seems that Martellus'
map influenced Martin Behaim

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:39.270
in creating the earliest
surviving terrestrial globe

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:40.930
from 1492.

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:43.230
We have textual evidence
of earlier globes,

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:46.030
but this is the earliest
one that survives.

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:49.290
And evidence for that
influence can be seen

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:51.980
in Southeast Asia here.

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:53.280
So again, this is
part of the map

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.070
where the information
comes from Marco Polo.

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:59.010
Marco Polo does not give
latitudes and longitudes

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:00.520
for the places he mentions.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:04.550
He says that this city is
15 days east of that city.

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:08.850
So to make a map based on Marco
Polo involves a very large

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:12.710
amount of extrapolation
and guess work,

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:14.430
and it's supremely unlikely

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:17.130
that two people would
do that very similarly.

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:21.640
So when we see the similarity of
Southeast Asia on Behaim's globe

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:26.520
and Martellus' map, it's very
good evidence of influence.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:32.360
You can see another good piece
of evidence in Eastern Asia

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.240
where we have this
triangular peninsula jutting

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.660
out into the Eastern Ocean.

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:39.850
Similar shape on both
the map and the globe,

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:44.020
and in both cases, aligned
just north of the tropic.

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:48.790
And third, there are
striking similarities

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:50.110
between Martellus' map

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:53.790
and Martin Waldseemuller's
1507 World Map.

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:58.240
And the similarities I'm about
to run through were noted

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.120
when Martellus' map surfaced.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.760
That is to say, scholars
thought, well,

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.160
it seems that Martellus'
map must have

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.970
influenced Waldseemuller.

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:10.890
The problem was that it wasn't
possible to read the text

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:14.040
on Martellus' map and
explore just how close the

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:17.020
relationship was.

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:20.070
So a few words about
Waldseemuller's World Map.

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:22.430
Again, the only surviving
exemplar is here

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:24.470
on permanent display at
the Library of Congress.

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:27.490
If you haven't seen
it, it's worth a look.

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:32.240
It's printed on 12
sheets, so a printed map,

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.760
but it only survives
in one copy.

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:39.860
And, of course, it's famous for,
not just including the New World

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:43.540
but for being the first map
to apply the name America

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:47.200
to the New World, so the
birth certificate of America.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:52.700
So the two maps are similar, so
they have similar dimensions.

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:56.930
They're both wall
maps for display.

00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:58.980
Both cartographers
take advantage

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:02.420
of the wide margins
left by the projection

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:04.950
to include large text
boxes in the lower left

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:07.490
and right-hand corners.

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:11.540
The contours of Africa
are very similar.

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:15.340
This is not really, it's not
good evidence of influence

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:18.350
because in both cases, the
contours of Africa derive

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:21.110
from Ptolemy's Geography.

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:24.780
But when we look at the
contours of Eastern Asia,

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.080
which are also very similar,

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:29.760
this is very strong
evidence of influence.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.110
Because again, the information

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:34.650
in this area is based
on Marco Polo.

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:38.540
It's very unlikely that two
people would independently map

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:41.960
Marco Polo's geography
so similarly.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.360
And one final detail is that
Japan on both maps is located

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.280
in the same location, the same
orientation, and in both cases,

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.850
at the right-hand
edge of the map.

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:57.330
So the big problem with
Martellus map, and the reason

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.950
for which it had remained
essentially unstudied

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:02.590
for 60 years, is that
almost all the text

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:05.740
on it had faded to illegibility.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:08.380
So if we look here
at Northeastern Asia

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:12.730
in natural light, we can see a
few banners indicating the names

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:15.990
of regions, but we really
don't see much in the way

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:17.550
of descriptive text at all,

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:22.450
which is a little surprising
giving the map's large size.

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:25.340
If we zoom in on the
northern coast of Asia,

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:28.390
we can see here there is text,

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:32.100
but trying to decipher it
would be quite difficult.

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:36.590
So this is the most legible text
on the map in Northeastern Asia,

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:38.890
and it's not very legible.

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:43.700
Here's the island of
Japan in natural light.

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:46.530
We would expect there to be
some descriptive text there,

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:49.560
not just because of
the map's large size,

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:53.590
but also because Martellus
himself made this map of Japan,

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:57.050
and on it, he does
include descriptive text.

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:05.230
And so the solution, a way
to try and get at the text

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:08.820
that lurks on Martellus'
map is multispectral

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:11.130
or hyperspectral imaging.

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:13.720
The basic idea of
this technology is

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:18.730
to take a dozen digital photos
of the object, or a small part

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:23.320
of the object, each at
specific frequencies of light.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:27.410
And those frequencies
range from ultraviolet

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:30.230
through the visible
spectrum into infrared.

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:32.940
Typically, each of those
will reveal something

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:34.240
about the object.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.670
Some of the text,
some of an image.

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:39.150
And the idea is to then
digitally combine those

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:42.020
in a way that, such a way that
everything that's revealed

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:45.910
by each of those
images appears in one.

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:50.430
A very simplified account of
it, but that's the basic idea.

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:54.260
And this technology is useful
for recovering text and images

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:58.390
from documents damaged
by fading, water, fire,

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:02.190
overpainting, palimpsesting
and wrinkling.

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:05.410
So if you imagine a
document that's been burned,

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:07.960
so you might have what
was originally black text

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.250
on what is now a
black substrate.

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:11.680
But at certain frequencies
of light,

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.250
those two surfaces will
reflect differently, and thus,

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:17.110
it's possible to
recover that text.

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:20.760
And with regard to
palimpsest, one of the earliest

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:23.940
and most important applications
of multispectral imaging

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:27.830
to manuscripts was to the
Archimedes palimpsest.

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:31.480
And so a palimpsest is
where the, a manuscript

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.740
in which the text
has scraped off

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:35.810
and the parchment
has been reused.

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:38.270
And using multispectral
imaging, it's possible

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:42.840
to recover the text
that's been scraped off.

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:46.030
And there were good indications

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:48.460
that the Martellus map
was a good candidate

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:50.610
for multispectral imaging.

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:53.650
So returning to Northeastern
Asia,

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:55.670
here it is in natural light.

00:16:55.670 --> 00:17:00.450
And I'll now switch to an
image of the same region taken

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:06.200
in ultraviolet light when the
map surfaced in the late 1950s.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.030
And we can see that
there is text everywhere.

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:12.310
This is one of the most exciting
images of a map I had ever seen.

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:15.620
It clearly confirmed that there
was a lot of text on the map.

00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:19.830
The question was
how to get at it.

00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:22.640
If we look at Southeastern
Africa in natural light

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.420
on the left and ultraviolet
light on the right,

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.250
we can see that the
ultraviolet image reveals much

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:31.460
of the river system that
stretches down the eastern part

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:34.400
of the continent that's
not readily visible

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.370
in the natural light
image on the left.

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:38.760
It also reveals other details.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:42.470
One looks closely, one
sees cities and the names

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:45.150
of the rivers become a
little bit more evident.

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:48.690
Another example, here's
the southeastern tip

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:50.720
of Africa in natural light.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:54.740
And now switching to infrared,
we can see that, again,

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:58.340
the rivers, the trees besides
the rivers and some of the names

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:02.430
of the rivers become
more evident.

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:06.220
So, multispectral imaging
involves ultraviolet

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:08.010
and infrared images.

00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:10.790
So the fact that ultraviolet
and infrared images

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:12.430
of the map reveal things,

00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:16.300
suggests that multispectral
imaging will be successful

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:18.570
in examining the map.

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:21.200
One other example in Africa

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.660
in a natural light
image is just possible

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:26.000
to suspect the text is there.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.680
And it's more evident,
if not readily legible,

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.190
in an ultraviolet image.

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:33.530
So these are all good
pieces of evidence

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:39.010
that multispectral imaging
will be successful in the map.

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:41.980
So my imaging colleagues
and I applied for a grant

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:45.470
from the National Endowment for
the Humanities to image the map.

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:48.070
Our application was,
fortunately, successful,

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:52.120
and we went to the Beinecke
for ten days in August of 2014

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:54.650
to perform the imaging.

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:57.640
Here we are, that's
me on the left.

00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:02.350
It's Ken Boydston, who is the
CEO and founder of MegaVision,

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:06.530
a company that makes excellent
cameras and other equipment

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:08.740
for doing multispectral imaging.

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:11.250
Roger Easton of the
Rochester Institute

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:12.950
of Technology is in the middle.

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:15.190
Roger was responsible for
much of the processing

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:18.030
of the images for this project.

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:21.710
And we have Michael Phelps who
is director of the early Library

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:25.890
of Electronic Texts,
which he runs a project

00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:29.140
at Saint Catherine's Monastery
in the Sinai Peninsula,

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:33.500
which is the oldest continuously
operating library in the world

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:35.850
and also has the
largest collection

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:39.520
of palimpsest manuscripts
in the world.

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:41.590
And on the right, we
have Gregory Heyworth,

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:47.330
the founder of our group,
the Lazarus Project.

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:51.070
And it was Gregory's idea
to create a portable system

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:55.010
for multispectral imaging
so that the technology comes

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:58.360
to the institution,
the fragile object,

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.970
and we're only interested
in damaged objects,

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:03.270
does not have to travel.

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:07.450
Here is the map out of its case.

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:10.810
It was removed from its case by
the curators of the Beinecke.

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:14.180
You can see it supported
on a large easel

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:15.840
that we brought with us.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.270
The map is tilted
back at 10 degrees

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:20.780
so that gravity holds
it in place.

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:25.210
An easel allowed us to move
the map in front of the camera,

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:27.370
so it allowed us to move
the map both vertically

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:29.150
and horizontally.

00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:31.710
When doing multispectral
imaging, it's very important

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:34.160
that the spatial
relationship between the camera

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.690
and the lights remain
constant, so the camera

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:39.650
and lights were fixed in place
while we moved the map in front

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:42.200
of the camera to
perform the imaging.

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:47.150
Another view, so looking
from behind the camera,

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:49.310
with the map over to the left.

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:53.270
The metal bars there are
the laser-focusing device.

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:56.680
So the surface of the map
is not perfectly even,

00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:02.590
so we had to refocus frequently
as we moved across it.

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:04.300
And starting at the top here,

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:09.270
so up high we have the
multispectral LED light source.

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:12.310
So the way multispectral
imaging used to be done was

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:15.480
that one would shine a bright,
white light at the object.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:18.000
White light contains
all the frequencies.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.480
And one would then put a filter
in front of the camera lens

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:23.000
so that one would
only obtain the image

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.630
at the desired frequency.

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:27.340
So there are two
problems with that system.

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:30.790
The first is that
it bathes the object

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:32.930
in too much energy really.

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:36.010
And then, of course,
any filter induces

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:37.790
at least some distortion.

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:40.640
So now, it's possible
to use LED lights

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:43.900
to shine only the desired,
the exact desired frequency

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:45.200
of light on the object.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:49.100
So it's a really very small
amount of energy, less, in fact,

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:53.300
than if the object were
lying under these lights.

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:58.450
So we have the LED light
source, and we have a diffuser

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:00.360
which ensures that
the light arrives

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.910
on the object evenly
distributed.

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:08.180
Here is the grid of
overlapping tiles

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:11.470
into which we divided the
map for purposes of imaging.

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:13.200
Overlapping, of course,

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.410
so we could later stitch
the images together.

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:20.490
One spends a lot
of time in the dark

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:23.450
with these colored
lights flashing.

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:26.210
And one hopes that one's
colleagues have some good

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:27.510
stories to tell us.

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:30.800
The computer cycles through
the different exposures.

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:35.840
But after this long prelude,

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:38.460
let's have a look
at the results.

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:40.070
So we'll begin with
this text block

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:42.740
in the lower right-hand corner.

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:44.760
If we zoom in in a
natural light image,

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.550
it's clear that there
are letters,

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:50.770
but trying to read them
is quite challenging.

00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:54.090
Here's an infrared image.

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:59.110
Maybe it was helpful with a
few letters, but not very.

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:04.490
The ultraviolet image, which I
don't think is helpful at all.

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:07.450
And the multispectral image.

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:09.920
So, I think this sequence
is very instructive,

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:12.630
because in the past, people
have used infrared light

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:15.690
and ultraviolet light
to try to study text

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:16.990
on damaged manuscripts.

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:20.580
And this shows very clearly how
much more powerful multispectral

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:22.000
imaging is.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:29.000
Moving into the map proper,
we'll begin with the Alps.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.560
So the map in natural
light really is this murky.

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:36.150
There's the multispectral image.

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:38.290
There are place names
everywhere.

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:40.930
This image caught me a
little bit by surprise.

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:44.580
I wasn't expecting the place
names to be quite that dense.

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:48.200
Northern Asia.

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.200
Again, the natural light image.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.000
The multispectral image.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.110
On the left and the right
here, we begin to see some

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:57.910
of the longer descriptive text
that I'll talk about later.

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:04.700
Japan. Again, the natural light
image, multispectral image.

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:06.450
The text appears.

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:12.100
And it looks wonderful until
one tries to start reading it.

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:14.920
And when I did so, I realized
that letters were missing

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:19.030
at the eastern part
of the island.

00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:20.490
And so I asked Roger Easton,

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:24.700
is there any other way these
images can be processed so as

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:27.140
to reveal those extra letters?

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:29.650
And Roger, fortunately,
was able to do so.

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:33.370
So here we see those
letters appearing.

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:36.560
Which brings us to the
importance of image processing

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:39.710
or Roger, can you
give it one more try?

00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:43.660
So, we spent ten days at the
Beinecke taking the images.

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:47.350
But it's definitely not the
case that one takes the images

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:52.650
and all the text suddenly
and magically appears.

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:54.940
We spent months processing
the images.

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:58.400
That is to say, Roger spent
months processing the images.

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:01.670
And as you'll see
shortly, this is,

00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:04.390
this map was particularly
complicated in terms

00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:05.690
of the image processing.

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:06.990
But the way we generally
worked was

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:10.440
that Roger would send me images,
I would study the text in them.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.610
I would make a PowerPoint
indicating

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:14.740
where I was still
unable to read the text.

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:19.150
I would send that back to Roger,
and he would try new techniques.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:24.750
So, if we look at India,
you can just barely see

00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:27.350
in the natural light image
near the top of the text,

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:31.040
top of the image there of three
texts, which I circle here,

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:33.910
the multispectral
image certainly helps,

00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:35.390
but it's this area
that I want to focus

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:38.440
on where we don't see any text.

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:40.170
Nor do we see any text here

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:44.280
in another processed
multispectral image.

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:48.450
Nor here, in another
processed multispectral image.

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:52.130
And yet here, text
suddenly appears.

00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:53.430
So what this means is

00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:55.050
that Martellus was
using different pigments

00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:58.280
to write different texts in
different parts of the map.

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:01.180
And those different pigments
respond differently to light,

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:04.620
so they appear in some
processes but not in others.

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:07.060
And this certainly
complicated the study,

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:09.590
not just the processing of
the image, but also the study

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:12.850
of the map, because there was
no one image that showed all

00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:15.190
of the text on the map.

00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:19.520
If we look at another
example in Northeastern Asia,

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.960
an area we've looked at before,

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:27.400
so here's the natural light
image, the multispectral image.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:30.600
It reveals these two
texts quite well.

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:34.080
But here, all we see
are the lines that were

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.410
to guide the scribe
in writing the texts.

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:37.710
We don't see the text itself.

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:40.410
So this is another case
where the texts were written

00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:44.190
in different pigments that
responded differently to light.

00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:46.900
And the fact that some
of the texts were written

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:49.530
in different pigments is
a physical characteristic

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:51.580
of the map that one
would never guess looking

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:53.880
at it in natural light.

00:26:56.330 --> 00:27:01.150
So, we were quite successful
in recovering the texts

00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:02.540
on the map eventually.

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:04.360
And one thing we can do

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:09.050
with that is undertake this
comparison of Martellus' map

00:27:09.050 --> 00:27:10.630
and Martin Waldseemuller's,

00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:13.650
explore just how close the
relationship between them is.

00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:15.600
Something that had
been impossible

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:19.100
for the 60 preceding years.

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:22.850
So if we begin in Africa,

00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:26.190
so here we have a natural
light image of a detail

00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:29.450
of Martellus' map that
includes some text.

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:32.770
The multispectral
image makes it legible.

00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:37.720
There's a corresponding
text on Waldseemuller's map.

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:41.870
And if we transcribe, what I've
done here is underline the words

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:43.170
that are the same.

00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:46.590
So it's the words that are not
underlined that are different.

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:49.420
So, we have, I think
it's four words

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:51.030
of difference, or five maybe.

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:54.180
So we have substantially
the same information

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:57.910
in the same location
on the two maps.

00:27:57.910 --> 00:28:01.200
And just to translate, here
there are great wildernesses

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.190
in which there are
lions and big leopards

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:06.460
and many other animals different
from ours, that is different

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:09.220
from European animals.

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:13.780
Moving to the Southeast
in Africa.

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:15.990
Again, the natural light image.

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:17.700
Now it's legible.

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:21.160
The corresponding text
on Waldseemuller's map.

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.980
And transcribing, we can
see there are two words

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:26.620
of difference, so essentially
the same information

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:29.000
in the same location.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.570
And translating.

00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:33.440
The chersidras or
celidras is born here,

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:36.350
a serpent that causes
the ground to smoke.

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:43.960
Moving out into the Indian
Ocean, we have a cartouche,

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:47.070
which is illegible
on Martellus' map.

00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:49.830
The multispectral
image makes it legible.

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:51.130
There's a corresponding
cartouche,

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:55.680
a cartouche in the same
location on Waldseemuller's map.

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:58.350
Transcribing, you can
see there's just one word

00:28:58.350 --> 00:28:59.650
of difference.

00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:01.820
Again, the same information
in the same location.

00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:04.530
So very strong evidence
of influence.

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.860
Here is seen the orca, a sea
monster that is like the sun

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:12.140
when it shines, whose form
can hardly be described,

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:15.730
except that its skin is
soft and its body huge.

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:19.690
Moving into Asia.

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:23.600
Again, the natural light
image, multispectral.

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.920
Waldseemuller, so
here it's interesting

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:28.740
that not only the texts in
the same sort of latitude

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:30.830
and longitude on the two
maps, but in both cases,

00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:34.150
they're between these
two mountain ranges.

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:37.010
Transcribing, again,
just one word

00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:39.350
of difference between the two.

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:42.540
Here there are monsters similar
to men but with ears so large

00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:44.770
that they cover their
whole bodies with them.

00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:49.760
So these are the Panotti,
this mythical race of people

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:56.710
that had these huge ears that
they could use as sleeping bags.

00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:59.350
Moving to Southeast Asia.

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:05.110
Again, the natural light image,
multispectral, Waldseemuller.

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:08.870
Just one word of difference,
so Martellus says here,

00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:10.170
Waldseemuller says there.

00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:13.760
Here there are many animals
different from our animals,

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:16.060
different from European animals.

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:20.190
So, there is, in fact,

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:23.130
a very close relationship
between the two maps.

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:25.990
And it seems that Waldseemuller
was doing quite a bit

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:27.310
of copying.

00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:31.060
But I think this is where things
start to get more interesting,

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:33.280
because he wasn't
simply copying.

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.910
He was choosing what to copy.

00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:40.110
So it was a judicious use
of an important source.

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:43.980
So let's now look at some cases
where Waldseemuller departed

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:46.730
from what he found
on Martellus' map.

00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:49.860
As we saw before, the
shape of North Africa

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:51.910
on the two maps is very similar.

00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:53.920
Again, that's because
in both cases it comes

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.360
from Ptolemy's Geography.

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:59.200
But the shape of Southern
Africa is very, very different.

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:03.590
So, as we can see in the upper
right, on Martellus' map,

00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:06.240
Southern Africa has
this strange shape

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:08.940
like a human foot
pointing off to the right,

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:11.600
where as on Waldseemuller's
map on the lower left,

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:16.450
it looks much closer
to a modern map.

00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:19.200
So this is immediate
and strong evidence

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:22.760
that Waldseemuller was not
simply copying what he found

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:25.380
on Martellus' map.

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:29.150
So let's look at the coast
of Africa, and specifically,

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:32.480
a spot a bit to the north of
where this strong difference

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.090
in the contours of the coast.

00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:37.700
And thus a spot where
we might expect

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:42.150
that Waldseemuller would
copy from Martellus.

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:44.740
Here is the natural light image.

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:49.720
The place names are not just
illegible, they're invisible.

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:53.600
But they come out quite well
in the multispectral image.

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:56.130
Here is the corresponding
part of the cost

00:31:56.130 --> 00:31:58.590
on Waldseemuller's map.

00:31:58.590 --> 00:31:59.890
We can immediately see

00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:03.410
that Waldseemuller has more
place names than Martellus,

00:32:03.410 --> 00:32:04.980
and if we compare closely,

00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:09.540
it turns out that not a
single one is the same.

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:12.790
So as keen as he was to
copy the descriptive texts

00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:16.540
from Martellus, he did not
copy the African place names,

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:18.670
the coastal Africa place names.

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:19.970
And we can imagine that was

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:23.990
because he had a more recent
source available to him.

00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:27.010
So again, Waldseemuller
making judicious use

00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:29.310
of one of his sources.

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:33.190
Looking at the Arabian
Peninsula.

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:35.730
Here it is in natural
light on Martellus' map.

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:37.590
This is one of the
few areas of the map

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:41.690
where place names are
legible in natural light.

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:44.850
They are nonetheless
more readily legible

00:32:44.850 --> 00:32:47.200
in the multispectral image.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:51.350
Here is the corresponding
part of Waldseemuller's map.

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:54.720
Given that Waldseemuller
had either this map

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:57.400
or another one very
similar, likely the latter,

00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:02.270
in his workshop, and also
given that in neither map,

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:04.630
in both maps all
of the information

00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:07.820
in the Arabian Peninsula
comes from Ptolemy.

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:09.320
We might expect

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:12.370
that Waldseemuller would simply
have copied the place names he

00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:14.630
found on Martellus' map.

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:16.140
But that is not the case.

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:19.010
He made an entirely independent
selection of place names

00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:20.310
from Ptolemy's geography.

00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:23.500
And an easy way to show
that is here I've circled

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:26.630
on Martellus' map place
names from the central part

00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:29.860
of the peninsula that
are on Martellus' map

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:32.430
but do not appear
on Waldseemuller's.

00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:35.610
And here, place names from the
central part of the peninsula

00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:37.610
that do appear on
Waldseemuller's map

00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:39.120
but not on Martellus'.

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:42.610
So again, a completely
independent selection

00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:44.910
of place names from Ptolemy.

00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:48.080
Looking at the Northern Ocean.

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:51.340
What we have on Martellus
is an island

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:54.590
with a cartouche
above and below.

00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:57.230
It's now legible.

00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:59.600
And on Waldseemuller's map,
something very different.

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:03.370
So there is an island,
but it's much smaller.

00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:05.380
And there's one long text.

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:08.490
And in fact, the texts
are entirely different.

00:34:08.490 --> 00:34:12.070
On Martellus' map the text
comes from Pliny, whereas,

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:14.690
on Waldseemuller's map it
comes from Pomponius Mela.

00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:20.160
So a case in which Waldseemuller
did not follow Martellus.

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:27.160
And moving into the Indian Ocean
again, there's a cartouche here

00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:29.220
that talks about a
fish called the narco

00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:32.220
that makes a fisherman's
arm and whole body numb,

00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:34.490
even through the line
and fishing pole.

00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:35.810
And for whatever reason,

00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:38.640
Waldseemuller does not include
this information on his map.

00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:42.350
So it seems we have a case where
Waldseemuller simply chose not

00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:45.970
to follow what he found
on Martellus' map.

00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:50.100
Looking at the text boxes

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:53.320
in the lower left-hand
corners of the maps.

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:54.620
We can immediately

00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:56.750
that Waldseemuller's
text is much longer.

00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:59.110
He's talking about the
discovery of the New World,

00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:03.250
which evidently hadn't happened
when Martellus made his map.

00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:06.550
So even though he's talking
about a different subject,

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:10.540
he nonetheless kept
his eyes on Martellus

00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:12.180
for things he could use.

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:13.560
And we can see that
he has copied

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:16.020
that whole final
phrase from Martellus.

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:20.700
So, even when he was taking his
map in a different direction,

00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:24.500
he continued to consult
Martellus' map to look

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:26.860
for things that he
could borrow from it.

00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:33.160
So I'm going to move now into
one of the most remarkable areas

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:38.190
of Martellus' map, which
is Southern Africa.

00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:39.850
Here's the whole of
the continent of Africa

00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:42.090
in a multispectral image.

00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:44.650
And here are the Mountains
of the Moon, which were,

00:35:44.650 --> 00:35:47.610
according to Ptolemy,
the source of the Nile.

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:51.220
We zoom in a little bit.

00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:55.360
We can see that although
Ptolemy says that the Mountains

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:57.450
of the Moon were the
source of the Nile,

00:35:57.450 --> 00:36:01.890
that Nile River system
continues far to the south

00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:05.310
of the Mountains of the Moon.

00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:11.110
And moreover, there are many
named cities in this area.

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:14.650
And this is quite surprising

00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:18.790
because in most contemporary
maps of Africa, the Mountains

00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:21.820
of the Moon were essentially
the southern limit of knowledge.

00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:31.090
So here we return to the map
of Africa from the manuscript

00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:34.190
of Ptolemy made by Martellus
where we see that the Mountains

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:36.550
of the Moon are at the
southern edge of the map

00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:38.320
and thus represent
the southern limit

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:41.240
of knowledge in the interior.

00:36:42.610 --> 00:36:46.470
It's also interesting to
compare Martellus' map at Yale

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:49.800
on the left with
his own world map

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:54.380
in the British Library
manuscript of his island book.

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:57.240
So again, on the left,
we have this continuation

00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:01.130
of the Nile River System
and many named cities.

00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:05.110
On the right, the interior of
Africa is essentially empty.

00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:08.980
So we have coastal place
names and a few mountains,

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:14.860
but no river system, no
mountains, no cities,

00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:17.600
no really detailed mountain
ranges in the interior.

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:19.610
So, it becomes clear

00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:22.670
that Martellus had found
another source of information

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:24.970
about Southern Africa.

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:28.100
And I suggest that
that southern,

00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:29.560
that source of information

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:32.120
about Southern Africa
was a map like this one.

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:35.190
This is so-called
Egyptus novelo map.

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:39.510
So it's a map of Africa that
appears in three manuscripts

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:41.720
of Ptolemy's Geography.

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:44.770
Ptolemy's Geography was
updated in various ways.

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:48.390
So, people in the 15th and
16th century recognized

00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:52.090
that Ptolemy's geographical
data was about 1,200 years old

00:37:52.090 --> 00:37:55.080
and that it was simply
out of date.

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:58.610
And so manuscripts
and printed editions

00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:01.130
of the geography were
updated in various ways,

00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:04.210
including the addition
of more modern maps.

00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:05.980
And this is precisely
one of those maps.

00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:11.440
So it's the new map
of Egypt, if you will.

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:14.310
And reorienting it
with north at the top

00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:16.710
so that everything is a
little bit more familiar.

00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:21.680
We have the Mediterranean,
the Nile Delta, the Red Sea.

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:24.070
At the bottom, part
of the Southern Ocean.

00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:29.450
So this map is showing almost
the whole north-south extension

00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:34.540
of the continent and many
named cities in the south.

00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:38.130
If we zoom in, we can see
just how dense they are.

00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:41.770
And the river system, again,

00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:44.620
continues quite far
to the south.

00:38:45.830 --> 00:38:48.860
And if we put the two
maps side-by-side,

00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:51.000
on the Egyptus novelo
map, on the left,

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.410
the river system runs
off the right-hand edge.

00:38:55.410 --> 00:38:57.730
And we can see at the
corresponding point

00:38:57.730 --> 00:39:00.460
of Martellus' map, the
rivers are doing something

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:02.840
very similar.

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:07.980
And in fact, many of
the names of the cities

00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:10.700
on Martellus' maps
correspond with names

00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:12.130
on the Egyptus novelo map.

00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:17.770
So, that's very strong
evidence of influence.

00:39:17.770 --> 00:39:19.680
It's thought that
the information

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:23.040
on the Egyptus novelo map
was transmitted to Europe

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:26.090
by quote/unquote Ethiopian
delegates to the Council

00:39:26.090 --> 00:39:29.360
of Florence in 1441 to '43.

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:30.720
We have very clear records

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:33.330
that there were Ethiopian
delegates there,

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:37.940
and Ethiopian means basically
Africa south of Egypt.

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:39.620
And we have records that
they were questioned

00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:45.740
about the geography of their
homeland, and the questioners,

00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:48.100
when they heard the
replies, said, well,

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:51.200
what you say does not agree with
Ptolemy, so you must be wrong.

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:53.930
But it's easy to imagine

00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:56.660
that there were other people
a little bit more open-minded

00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:59.200
who questioned them
in more detail.

00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:02.300
And in fact, we have
a nice confirmation

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:04.840
that the geographical
information on these maps,

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:09.050
on Martellus' map, comes
from Ethiopian sources.

00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:13.490
So if we look at the
southeastern tip of Africa,

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:15.550
we can see that there's
a barrier of mountains

00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:16.850
and a channel running

00:40:16.850 --> 00:40:20.870
across that essentially
separate this peninsula

00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:23.170
from the rest of the continent.

00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:30.570
And if we compare that with Fra
Mauro's world map of circa 1455,

00:40:30.570 --> 00:40:32.240
which is in the [inaudible]
in Venice.

00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:36.160
And I've, it's oriented
with south at the top.

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:39.620
I've rotated it to make things
a little bit more familiar.

00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:42.380
We see Europe and Africa there.

00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:46.010
The part I want to focus
on is Southern Africa.

00:40:47.310 --> 00:40:49.330
And if we look at
the southeastern tip

00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:53.010
of the continent, we can see
that it has this channel running

00:40:53.010 --> 00:40:58.160
across it, separating that tip
from the rest of the continent.

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:00.880
Which is very, very
similar, strikingly similar

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:03.390
to what we see on
Martellus' map.

00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:08.500
And in fact, from Fra Mauro says
explicitly, that his depiction

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:12.780
of Southeastern Africa comes
from Ethiopian sources.

00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:18.200
People from Ethiopia came to
Venice, and he obtained his,

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:24.180
he rendered Southeastern Africa
according to their descriptions.

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:26.680
So the fact that Fra
Mauro's depiction comes

00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:30.650
from Ethiopian sources,
confirms that what we see

00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:34.650
on Martellus' map also comes
from Ethiopian sources.

00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:40.970
The really exciting
thing about what we have

00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:46.280
in Martellus' map is that on the
left in the Egyptus novelo map,

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:48.740
we don't see the eastern
part of the continent.

00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:51.060
It's cut off by a meridian.

00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:54.960
Whereas, Martellus extends that
geography further to the east.

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:58.260
We see the whole southeastern
part of the continent.

00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:01.050
And thus, it seems that
Martellus was working

00:42:01.050 --> 00:42:04.390
from a more complete version
of the same information,

00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:07.720
and it seems to be the
only more complete version

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:09.680
of that information
that survives.

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:13.650
Which is to say that Martellus'
map has sort of buried

00:42:13.650 --> 00:42:17.510
within it a map of
Southern Africa according

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:21.220
to African sources from the
15th century, which in terms

00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:23.880
of the cartographic history

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:26.760
of Africa is something
simply remarkable.

00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:30.450
So a few conclusions.

00:42:30.450 --> 00:42:34.710
One of the exciting things
about this project is precisely

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:37.250
that this map that was this
great un-studiable object

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:43.330
for 60 years is now
studiable in all its aspects.

00:42:43.330 --> 00:42:48.360
Eventually, all of the images
generated by this project,

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:51.570
both the raw data and the
process multispectral images,

00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:55.080
will be made freely available
on the Beinecke's website.

00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:59.520
And so I came to the map with
my questions, but I'm eager

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:02.850
for other people to
come to it with theirs.

00:43:02.850 --> 00:43:05.640
Which is precisely
what that will enable.

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:11.580
It will also make it possible as
new multispectral, new processes

00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:15.640
for working with multispectral
images is developed,

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:17.100
it will make it possible
for scholars

00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:20.920
to reprocess the raw data
and pull more information

00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:25.360
from the map without the map
itself having to be disturbed.

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:29.210
I think it's very exciting to
be able to compare the Martellus

00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:31.990
and Waldseemuller
maps at long last.

00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:37.130
And part of that is that when we
can see how Waldseemuller made

00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:42.850
use of one of his most important
sources, it gives us an insight

00:43:42.850 --> 00:43:45.770
into how he went
about making the map.

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:47.160
So we don't have diaries.

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:49.510
We don't have workshop
journals from cartographers

00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:53.220
of that period, but when
we can see what parts

00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:56.470
of the Martellus map
Waldseemuller made use of,

00:43:56.470 --> 00:44:01.680
which parts he didn't, it gives
us some insight into his methods

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:04.870
for making a world map.

00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:07.490
And finally, the fact that
the Martellus map contains

00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:10.910
within it this map of
Southern Africa according

00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:14.730
to African sources
is very exciting.

00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:16.530
Thank you very much.

00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:26.190
[ Applause ]

00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:28.000
I'm happy to take questions.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.300
Yes.

00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:30.900
&gt;&gt; I think there
was some symposium

00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:37.140
at the Library a couple of years
ago, there was another library

00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:40.350
that has a copy of the
Waldseemuller map, or is,

00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:43.430
could you talk about what
that relationship is.

00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:45.100
Because it had the
America on it.

00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:46.610
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer:
That's right, so --

00:44:46.610 --> 00:44:47.940
&gt;&gt; What is that other one?

00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:49.930
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: It's
the Stevens Brown map

00:44:49.930 --> 00:44:51.870
at the John Carter
Brown Library.

00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:57.760
And there's great dispute about
when exactly it was printed.

00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:00.410
So it came from Waldseemuller's
workshop.

00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:03.490
And it's a map very
similar to the world map

00:45:03.490 --> 00:45:07.160
in his 1513 edition of Ptolemy.

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:10.390
But the production
process of a 1513 edition

00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:15.010
of Ptolemy was very long, and
the argument has been made

00:45:15.010 --> 00:45:19.250
that that map was printed
before Waldseemuller printed his

00:45:19.250 --> 00:45:20.870
1507 map.

00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:28.140
I, the arguments are very
subtle, and to my mind,

00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:31.300
they're not strong enough
to overturn the Library

00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:34.440
of Congress' claim to have
the earliest printed map

00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:36.190
that has the name America.

00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:38.380
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:47.860
&gt;&gt; Hi. Thank you so much for
engaging a fascinating talk.

00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:52.340
This was wonderful.

00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:54.790
So, I [inaudible]
in Philadelphia.

00:45:56.840 --> 00:46:08.400
I was wondering if you would
please explain their 1507 copy

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:09.700
of Waldseemuller [inaudible].

00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:12.770
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: You'll have
to give me a little bit more.

00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:14.070
So you mean.

00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:21.450
&gt;&gt; Well, I mean they have
a 1507 copy of this book

00:46:21.450 --> 00:46:23.600
with the whole foldout
map intact

00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:28.020
in the [inaudible]
collection, so.

00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:30.570
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer:
Okay, well I will have

00:46:30.570 --> 00:46:34.390
to have a look at that.

00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:39.130
Is the book in question the
Cosmographiae Introductio?

00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:40.430
&gt;&gt; It is.

00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:42.640
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: Okay, I
will have a look at that.

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:46.370
&gt;&gt; And I'm very familiar
with the map,

00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:56.430
but I just started working
at the Library of Congress,

00:46:56.430 --> 00:47:07.390
and I have not seen the
copy that's on display.

00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:09.060
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: Okay.

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:14.900
&gt;&gt; I don't know if I'm being,
like [inaudible] was saying,

00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:16.820
like there is another.

00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:18.140
But so.

00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:19.440
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: Okay.

00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:23.470
&gt;&gt; But I don't know, I didn't
know if you had seen it or not.

00:47:23.470 --> 00:47:27.440
So maybe there's
something wrong with it.

00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:32.850
But it was considered
one of its treasures.

00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:39.240
They're not very good at
telling people they have it,

00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:42.550
so I'm not surprised.

00:47:42.550 --> 00:47:43.990
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: Okay, okay.

00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:52.850
Well, I'd be grateful
to learn more about it.

00:47:52.850 --> 00:47:54.150
&gt;&gt; Well great, okay.

00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:55.450
Fantastic.

00:47:55.450 --> 00:47:56.750
Thanks.

00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:58.050
&gt;&gt; Thank you for your
stimulating remarks.

00:47:58.050 --> 00:48:04.870
And I'm glad that you got
your funding from NEH in 2014.

00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:06.170
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: Yes.

00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:07.470
Thank you.

00:48:07.470 --> 00:48:08.770
Yes.

00:48:08.770 --> 00:48:12.060
&gt;&gt; The shared text,
do they only exist

00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:17.070
in those two places
that you know of?

00:48:17.070 --> 00:48:19.040
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: There are
later maps that copy some

00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:21.090
of Waldseemuller's texts.

00:48:21.090 --> 00:48:24.210
And well I had always
assumed they were copied

00:48:24.210 --> 00:48:28.970
from Waldseemuller.

00:48:28.970 --> 00:48:32.470
It's possible they were copied

00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:38.270
from another version
of Martellus' map.

00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:43.240
But there are other, but I think
they're simply copies rather

00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:44.540
than, yeah.

00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:45.840
Yes.

00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:47.140
&gt;&gt; Regarding Southeast Africa.

00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:48.440
&gt;&gt; Chat Van Duzer: Yes.

00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:49.790
&gt;&gt; The parts that are on
this map but they're not

00:48:49.790 --> 00:48:55.570
on Waldseemuller, did he have
the names from these in that,

00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:57.200
you know, foot extension on --

00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:02.520
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: Did
Waldseemuller have those names?

00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:03.820
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:05.120
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: It does not.

00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:07.490
No, there are, in southern, the
coast of Southern Africa, yes,

00:49:07.490 --> 00:49:11.170
there are some names
that are the same.

00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:17.080
But I'm trying to remember,
Southeastern Africa.

00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:19.590
I don't, did the
coastal place names,

00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:22.850
I don't think there are
any coastal place names

00:49:22.850 --> 00:49:25.210
in that Southeastern tip.

00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:30.680
And even going up the
eastern coast of Africa

00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:32.180
on the Martellus map, there
are relatively few place names.

00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:33.530
But I don't remember whether
there's much crossover there.

00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:35.120
&gt;&gt; So he was making a judgment
that this just wasn't accurate.

00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:36.420
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: Well he,

00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:37.720
what he was doing
was making a judgment

00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:39.020
that he knew he had
something more recent.

00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:40.320
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:41.620
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: Yes.

00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:42.920
&gt;&gt; Do you have any idea what
caused such dramatic fading

00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:44.220
or what pigments
they were on the map?

00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:45.520
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: I don't, and
we, it would have been wonderful

00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:46.820
to incorporate that
work into our project.

00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:48.120
We weren't able to do so.

00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:49.420
We were also not able to see
the back of the Martellus map,

00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:50.720
which would have been
very illuminating.

00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:52.020
But the way it's been mounted,
that just was not possible.

00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:53.320
Yeah. Yes.

00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:54.620
&gt;&gt; So this is more of
a technical question.

00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:55.920
You said that you, I think
the easel was at 10 degrees

00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:57.220
and a stationary camera.

00:49:57.220 --> 00:49:58.520
You moved the camera
vertically and horizontally.

00:49:58.520 --> 00:49:59.820
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: We moved the
map vertically and horizontally.

00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:01.120
&gt;&gt; Okay, so how do you keep a
kind of consistent plane of view

00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:02.420
on the map if your
map is angled?

00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:03.720
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: So the
camera was angled as well.

00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:05.020
So, the focal plane of
the camera was parallel

00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:06.320
to the surface of the map.

00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:07.620
&gt;&gt; Is the Lazarus
Project working

00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:08.920
on anything interesting
these days?

00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:10.220
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: I hope so.

00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:11.520
So the globe that I showed,

00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:12.820
the earliest surviving
terrestrial globe is another

00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:14.120
great candidate for
multispectral imaging.

00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:15.420
It suffered a lot of damage

00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:16.720
and some misguided
restorations over the years.

00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:18.020
And we have negotiated
access to image it.

00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:19.320
So it's, at this point,
it's just a matter

00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:20.620
of obtaining the funding.

00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:21.920
So that's a very
exciting prospect.

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:23.220
&gt;&gt; Where is that globe?

00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:24.520
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: In the German
National Museum in Nuremberg.

00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:25.820
&gt;&gt; How many images
did you take all told?

00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:27.120
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer:
That's a good question.

00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:29.780
So we actually imaged
the entire map twice

00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:34.850
because negotiating the
access is, takes its time.

00:50:34.850 --> 00:50:38.650
It's difficult getting the
people and the equipment there.

00:50:38.650 --> 00:50:39.950
It costs money.

00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:44.080
And you want to be absolutely
sure that everything goes right.

00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:47.210
And so we, after imaging
the whole map once,

00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:50.060
we made a few adjustments
on the exposures

00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:52.190
and imaged the whole map again.

00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:58.230
And having done it once, things
went more quickly and smoothly.

00:50:58.230 --> 00:51:03.170
But so I'm trying to remember
the exact number of photos,

00:51:03.170 --> 00:51:05.760
of images we took for each tile.

00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:07.380
So it's 55 tiles.

00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:09.440
We did each tile twice.

00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:11.010
And in addition to the,

00:51:11.010 --> 00:51:14.730
I believe it was 14
multispectral images,

00:51:14.730 --> 00:51:18.400
we also took some
images with raking light.

00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:22.700
So we're talking about
several hundred images.

00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:26.220
And then the number, the total
number of images generated

00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:28.020
by the project becomes higher

00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:30.600
when you include the
processed images.

00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:33.220
So, some parts of the map
were very challenging.

00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:37.970
The islands in Southeast Asia,
we still don't have images

00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:40.420
that successfully
reveal all the text.

00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:44.570
And Roger in his generosity
has tried everything he can

00:51:44.570 --> 00:51:45.990
think of.

00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:49.870
And so we have many, many
different processed images

00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:54.520
of those islands, also of Japan,

00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:56.540
and there's certainly
absolutely no reason

00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:58.750
to discard any of those.

00:51:58.750 --> 00:52:03.720
So, the total archive
is, yeah, many gigabytes.

00:52:06.450 --> 00:52:08.660
&gt;&gt; Did the raking
light, by any chance,

00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:13.220
reveal anything significant
that the multispectral did not?

00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:14.520
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: It didn't.

00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:17.300
In terms of having an image
of the whole map that's nice

00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:19.210
to look at, it's great to
have some of the texture,

00:52:19.210 --> 00:52:22.450
but it wasn't helpful
in revealing text.

00:52:22.450 --> 00:52:24.800
&gt;&gt; When you say you're waiting
for funding of something,

00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:29.130
what kind of, what
are you talking about?

00:52:29.130 --> 00:52:32.470
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer:
You mean the amount?

00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:33.770
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:35.070
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: Oh.

00:52:35.070 --> 00:52:36.370
So --

00:52:36.370 --> 00:52:37.670
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] Yes, the amount.

00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:38.970
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer:
So for this project,

00:52:38.970 --> 00:52:41.320
I believe the grant
was for $53,000.

00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:48.040
And so the Lazarus Project
provides the equipment for free.

00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:53.290
So the essential costs are
transport and lodging really.

00:52:53.290 --> 00:52:57.830
For the Beheim globe,
I'm trying to remember.

00:52:57.830 --> 00:52:59.360
We do have a budget for it,

00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:01.490
but the number is
not coming to mind.

00:53:01.490 --> 00:53:04.300
It's a bit more because
the travel is to Germany.

00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:07.980
It's a bit more because the
globe is very complicated.

00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:13.370
It's not possible to remove
its metal stand entirely.

00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:16.650
And the globe does not rotate
freely within that stand.

00:53:16.650 --> 00:53:20.260
So, that one will be
much more challenging.

00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:22.500
And so we've budgeted
more time for it.

00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:24.340
&gt;&gt; What was that globe again?

00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:25.640
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: The name

00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:27.180
of the Cartographer
was Martin Beheim.

00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:29.550
It was made in 1492.

00:53:29.550 --> 00:53:33.170
And again, it's in the German
National Museum in Nuremberg.

00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:39.250
&gt;&gt; Could you talk a little bit
about the negotiation process

00:53:39.250 --> 00:53:43.960
and how you convince or
persuade the institutions

00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:47.590
to let you image
their materials?

00:53:47.590 --> 00:53:50.230
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer:
Yes, so really,

00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:56.320
the key to that is showing
work that we've already done.

00:53:56.320 --> 00:54:00.600
And for something, I guess
the difficult part is the very

00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:03.510
beginning of the negotiations
when you first start talking

00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:06.510
about the fact that we want
to bring all of this equipment

00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:10.930
to your library and sort of
come in and not touch but work

00:54:10.930 --> 00:54:13.970
with your most valuable
treasure.

00:54:13.970 --> 00:54:15.320
There's naturally resistance.

00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:18.020
But then once the
discussion gets to the point

00:54:18.020 --> 00:54:20.080
where you can show images,

00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:24.820
that tends to change the
tenor of the discussion.

00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:26.120
Yes.

00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:27.800
&gt;&gt; What sort of framing
was it in before, you know,

00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:30.820
you said you were
[inaudible] for imaging.

00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:32.120
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: Not framing.

00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:33.420
It's a case.

00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:34.720
&gt;&gt; Case, so was it like
a [inaudible] casing

00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:36.900
or just a standard case?

00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:40.080
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: It's, I
believe it's all plexiglass.

00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:41.860
Does that suffice?

00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:43.160
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:44.670
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: Okay.

00:54:44.670 --> 00:54:45.970
Yes.

00:54:45.970 --> 00:54:48.950
&gt;&gt; Who owns the rights
to the images?

00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:52.690
Your group, or is it the
institution that [inaudible]?

00:54:52.690 --> 00:54:53.990
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer:
Wonderful question.

00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:57.880
And so when we do a project,
we do not own the images.

00:54:57.880 --> 00:55:00.490
They all belong to
the institution.

00:55:00.490 --> 00:55:04.060
And with some grants,
there's a requirement

00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:06.720
that the images be made
publicly available.

00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:08.420
But of course, the
institution has to agree

00:55:08.420 --> 00:55:10.710
to that before permitting
the project to move forward.

00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:13.090
But we do not own the images.

00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:21.620
&gt;&gt; Were there any overlapping
sections that gave you clues

00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:24.140
that you wouldn't
have gotten otherwise?

00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:26.280
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: What
do you mean exactly?

00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:31.880
&gt;&gt; I'm just wondering if,
the way you sectioned it out,

00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:35.790
would it have been less fruitful

00:55:35.790 --> 00:55:41.080
to have gone through
the process?

00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:42.450
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: With
different partitioning.

00:55:42.450 --> 00:55:43.750
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:45.050
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: I'm not sure.

00:55:45.050 --> 00:55:47.890
I mean any way you
partition something like this,

00:55:47.890 --> 00:55:50.030
it will be inconvenient
at some point.

00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:54.850
But the matter of the
processing of the images

00:55:54.850 --> 00:55:57.470
and the fact I would ask Roger,
is there anything we can do

00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:59.850
to bring out something here,
and he would try something,

00:55:59.850 --> 00:56:02.450
and another text would
appear over here.

00:56:02.450 --> 00:56:05.290
That went on and on and on.

00:56:05.290 --> 00:56:10.280
And so, and it was
always surprising.

00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:11.580
Yes.

00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:19.380
&gt;&gt; What was your personal
happiest surprise you got

00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:23.170
[inaudible], like what
was your most [inaudible]?

00:56:23.170 --> 00:56:24.580
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer:
Yeah, certainly,

00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:27.510
Southern Africa was the
most exciting for me.

00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:30.410
And it was, I wasn't expecting

00:56:30.410 --> 00:56:32.480
that Southern Africa
would be that rich.

00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:34.610
You don't get much of
a clue of that looking

00:56:34.610 --> 00:56:36.450
at it in natural light.

00:56:36.450 --> 00:56:40.310
And in particular, in Southern
Africa, there's the city

00:56:40.310 --> 00:56:45.040
of Prester John, and
that surprised me.

00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:47.440
Particularly as on
Waldseemuller's map,

00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:50.400
Prester John is in Asia.

00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:55.910
So, another interesting
difference between the two maps.

00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:58.730
&gt;&gt; Is there a scholarly
consensus today

00:56:58.730 --> 00:57:01.270
on the Yale [inaudible] map?

00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:02.800
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: I
think the consensus is

00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:04.270
that it's a forgery.

00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:08.990
I believe it's on
exhibition at Mystic Seaport.

00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:13.550
&gt;&gt; Is it like an ancient
forgery or a new forgery.

00:57:13.550 --> 00:57:15.780
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: Early
20th century, yeah.

00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:19.150
&gt;&gt; That's like [inaudible]
chemistry.

00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:26.010
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: Yes, that
was how it was detected, yeah.

00:57:26.010 --> 00:57:27.310
Yes.

00:57:27.310 --> 00:57:30.590
&gt;&gt; Is there any ideas

00:57:30.590 --> 00:57:35.680
of why Waldseemuller put
water on the West Coast?

00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:37.160
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer:
There are ideas.

00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:39.400
So, it is occasioned
speculation.

00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:42.470
So the question is why,
before the European discovery

00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:44.980
of the Pacific, why does
Waldseemuller show water

00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:47.880
to the west of the New World.

00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:51.810
One idea is that this indicates
some sort of pre-discovery

00:57:51.810 --> 00:57:55.880
of the Pacific, so an
unknown voyage managed to get

00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:59.520
around South America
and see this ocean.

00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:01.620
I really think it's
just a deduction

00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:02.920
on Waldseemuller's part.

00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:07.730
So, Marco Polo says
that Japan is an island.

00:58:07.730 --> 00:58:10.850
If Japan is not the same as
the New World, then there has

00:58:10.850 --> 00:58:12.170
to be water between them.

00:58:12.170 --> 00:58:14.990
I think it's that simple.

00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:17.020
&gt;&gt; Now this is just
totally fascinating.

00:58:17.020 --> 00:58:21.930
I'm really intrigued
by all the place names.

00:58:21.930 --> 00:58:27.130
And you mentioned something

00:58:27.130 --> 00:58:29.570
about Ethiopian contribution
to the place names.

00:58:29.570 --> 00:58:32.340
Can you talk a little
bit about that?

00:58:32.340 --> 00:58:33.640
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: Yes.

00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:39.790
So, in this case, Ethiopia
means very vaguely Africa south

00:58:39.790 --> 00:58:41.100
of Egypt.

00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:46.110
And so we have, we
have written evidence

00:58:46.110 --> 00:58:51.000
that there were quote/unquote
Ethiopian delegates

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:55.470
at the Council of Florence.

00:58:55.470 --> 00:58:58.360
And they were in Jerusalem
when they heard about the fact

00:58:58.360 --> 00:59:01.720
that Council of Florence
would take place.

00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:05.340
And they thought since they
were not that far from it

00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:06.640
at that point, they
should attend.

00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:12.520
And as I said before, we know
that they were questioned

00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:16.360
about the geography
of their homeland.

00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:17.970
And that seems to be the source

00:59:17.970 --> 00:59:20.360
of the place names
in Southern Africa.

00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:24.800
There was actually a
surprising amount of exchange

00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:28.150
between Ethiopia and
Europe in the 15th century,

00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:31.220
more than we would expect.

00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:37.550
So there are, and one bit
of evidence of that is

00:59:37.550 --> 00:59:41.950
from [inaudible] saying
that he had Ethiopian,

00:59:41.950 --> 00:59:46.200
he questioned Ethiopian
people in Venice.

00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:47.500
But there's much more.

00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:48.800
So there are other possible
ways the information could have

00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:50.100
gotten to Europe,
but the Council

00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:51.400
of Florence seems most likely.

00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:52.700
&gt;&gt; Is there any question about
the authenticity or the age

00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:54.000
of the manuscript annotations?

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:55.300
Like could they have been
added at different points,

00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:56.600
or are you assuming that it
was all in one production?

00:59:56.600 --> 00:59:57.900
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: I did not see
any evidence of later editions.

00:59:57.900 --> 00:59:59.200
The handwriting is consistent.

00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:00.500
I'm trying to think of
anything that looked.

01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:01.800
&gt;&gt; The fading is consistent.

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:03.100
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: The fading
is certainly consistent, yes.

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:05.400
So I didn't see any
evidence of that.

01:00:07.610 --> 01:00:09.510
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Stillo: All
right, thank you so much.

01:00:09.510 --> 01:00:11.510
