00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.190
WESAM AL MEDHOUN: Hello, my
name is Wesam Al Medhoun,

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.630
I am a visiting scholar in the
MIT-UTM Malaysia Sustainable

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.940
Cities Program, and assistant
professor at the Islamic

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.030
University of Gaza, Palestine.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.300
In this video,
I'll be describing

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.280
ways in which Penang,
a city in Malaysia,

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.120
is trying to reduce
vehicle emissions.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.280
Traffic related
air pollution has

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.520
an adverse impact on the
environment and human health.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.650
Exposure to traffic emissions
create health problems

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.425
such as higher rates of
asthma, cardiovascular disease,

00:00:48.425 --> 00:00:54.070
and bad development in children,
pre-term and low birth weight

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.920
infants, childhood leukemia,
and premature death.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.650
Traffic emissions also
contain a large amount

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.990
of carbon dioxide, a
primary greenhouse gas that

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.700
contributes to global warming.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.190
SPEAKER1: People are burning
huge amounts of coal, oil,

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.490
and natural gas to
generate electricity.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.440
This releases harmful
greenhouse gases which

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.630
trap heat in the atmosphere.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.300
SPEAKER 2: No wonder I have
been feeling really warm

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.640
SPEAKER 1: As more
fossil fuels are burned,

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.590
the greenhouse gases will
trap more heat, causing

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.970
your temperature to rise.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.610
WESAM AL MEDHOUN: Cities
can reduce vehicle emissions

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.340
by reducing private
vehicle ownership,

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.730
by increasing the cost of owning
a vehicle, such as increasing

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.420
cost of a registration,
increasing cost of parking,

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.110
etc, regularly enforcing
emission standards, inspection

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.770
of all vehicles to
eliminate bad cars,

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.140
improving the efficiency
of road networks,

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.100
and providing safe efficient
and affordable public transport,

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.840
and integrating land use
and transportation planning.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.570
But not all of these strategies
are visible in every context.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.950
I will therefore, focus on
the case of Penang, a state

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.770
within Malaysia, to illustrate
how the context affects

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.670
these strategies.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.370
Why Malaysia?

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.810
The better growth of
the Malaysian economy

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.570
in recent decades has
resulted in the deterioration

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.050
of the environment.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.170
Malaysia is ranked as
the fourth most polluted

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.300
of 14 Asian countries.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.410
In particular, air pollution
and degradation of air quality

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.030
is a problem.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.270
World Health
Organization reports

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.570
show that approximately
1900 Malaysians

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.850
died due to outdoor
air pollution in 2012.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.280
According to the Malaysian
Ministry of Health,

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.950
diseases respiratory system
are the second greatest reason

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.700
for hospitalization and death.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.090
Respiratory diseases are
responsible for approximately

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.890
one out of ten hospitalizations,
and one out of five deaths.

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.430
Vehicle emissions are the single
largest cause of air pollution

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.370
in Malaysia, accounting for
82% of total air pollutants.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.400
Haze from forest
fires further degrades

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.890
air quality in Malaysia.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.450
Penang is an example of a
rapidly developing state

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.190
in Malaysia, with a
problem of air degradation.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.600
Private vehicle
ownership in Penang

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.930
is higher than the
national average,

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.260
but they are trying to
do something about it.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.340
Penang has the third largest
economy of Malaysian states,

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.350
and has a population
of 1.6 million.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.280
It is on the Northwest coast
of peninsular Malaysia,

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.880
by the Straits of Malacca.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.360
It is composed of two
parts-- Penang Island, where

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.079
the seats of the
government is, and Seberang

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.579
Perai, the mainland part.

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.380
Penang has a higher number
of registered motor vehicles

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.370
per person than other
Malaysian states.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.610
There are 2.52 million
registered motor vehicles,

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.960
an average of 1.25
cars per person.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.640
PROFESSOR FARHAN:
Penang, in the island,

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:42.780
as well as in the mainland,
have delayed the main spine

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.530
for the public transport.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.580
So because of that,
more and more people

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.600
go towards private forms of
transport, either motorcycle

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.715
or cars, and that, of course,
adds to the congestion problem.

00:04:55.715 --> 00:04:57.610
And when there's
congestion, and there's

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.640
high volume of cars
with low speed,

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.970
we know that it
affects the pollution.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.630
WESAM AL MEDHOUN: Like many
places around the world,

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.390
Penang is trying to improve
air quality by taking measures

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.740
to reduce vehicle emissions.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.890
What has been
Penang done so far?

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:22.030
Directed traffic law in one or
two lanes, based on intensity

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.260
to reduce congestion
on busy streets.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.920
Improved traffic
management control

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.420
through adjusting the
timing of traffic signals.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.550
And by constructing roundabouts
to reduce congestion.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.090
Providing free shuttle
buses from the mainland

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:40.200
to the island.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.290
These buses are meant to
transport of civil servant who

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.060
are working at the island
government compound,

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.380
and executives who are
working at the Bayan Lepas

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.590
industrial area created a
dedicated bike lane for parts

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.190
of Georgetown, the main city
of Penang Island, increased

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.340
enforcement of
emission standards

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.130
inspection during
car registration,

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:12.590
and changing of car ownership,
and introduced car-free day

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.360
at certain parts of Georgetown.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.820
These strategies have
reduced emission levels,

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:23.120
and consequently improve the
air quality in the state.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.540
The state also plans to reduce
private vehicle ownership

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.730
by providing affordable
and efficient

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.320
public transportation.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.710
MR. MUSTAQIN: But the
very poor connectivity

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:39.360
in terms of public transport
because the public transport

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.620
there is now-- many old buses.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:48.840
Now we're heading
[INAUDIBLE] and also

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:57.250
[INAUDIBLE] traffic problem that
will impact our air pollution.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.470
WESAM AL MEDHOUN: In
2015, the state of Penang

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.820
hired an independent
consultant to develop

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:07.150
a public transportation
master plan,

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.560
but they face major
challenges which

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:15.410
are-- transportation decisions
are made at the federal level.

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.930
Even a change in
the bus line running

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.340
through the town
of Georgetown needs

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:22.900
to be approved by the
federal government.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.220
This makes it very challenging
for the state government

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:27.970
to make changes.

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:31.480
Limited budget for
transportation planning,

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.680
because revenues powers lies
within the federal government,

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.590
the state government has
a very limited budget

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:42.237
for making improvements to
its transportation network.

00:07:42.237 --> 00:07:43.820
PROFESSOR FARHAN:
So this all adds out

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.090
to non- sustainable practices.

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:48.830
And I think the
state government this

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:52.601
trying very hard to solve this.

00:07:52.601 --> 00:07:54.740
And they have come up
with several strategies

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:59.294
and they introduced a
transport master plan.

00:07:59.294 --> 00:08:00.710
Part of that
transport master plan

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:05.480
is an extensive rail network.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:09.290
Unfortunately they are not
able to secure any funding

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:12.360
from the federal government
so they have to be creative,

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.530
and perhaps this is
another challenge

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:17.310
for sustainability, financing.

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:22.110
And I think Penang is
trying an initiative that

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:25.830
is self-sustaining
through public partnership

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:29.481
with the public- private
partnership model.

00:08:29.481 --> 00:08:30.980
WESAM AL MEDHOUN:
Penang authorities

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.539
plan to finance the
transport master

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:36.659
plan by selling reclaimed land.

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:40.270
But they have yet to do
an environmental impact

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:41.289
assessment.

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:44.490
Therefore, while
public transportation

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:48.330
is critical to reducing
vehicle emissions,

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.550
reducing negative
environmental impacts

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:57.110
requires thoughtful finance
and implementation mechanisms.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:59.800
To conclude, Penang
decision makers

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:03.670
might adopt sustainable
transportation policies

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:08.930
that have been implemented
by five major Asian cities

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:15.580
like Hong Kong, Tokyo,
Singapore, Seoul, and Shanghai.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:20.380
These include promoting
public transportation,

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:24.130
integrating land use
and transport planning,

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:28.000
and instituting travel
demand management

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.530
to bring about sustainable
transportation system.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:37.800
Adding to that, more stringent
car emissions inspection,

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.550
and expanding the
free-car day can further

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:44.180
reduce traffic emissions.

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:47.710
Transport planning and
implementation in Penang

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:50.970
still faces several
challenges that

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:57.330
need to be handled wisely in
order to be more sustainable.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:00.030
At the same time,
positive element

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:03.100
of Penang's
implemented strategies

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:08.790
are a promising example
for less developed cities.

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:47.240
