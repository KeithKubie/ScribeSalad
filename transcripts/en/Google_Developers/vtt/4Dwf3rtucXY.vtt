D'Alesandre: Hi.

00:00:02.033 --> 00:00:05.033
Welcome to "Building Enterprise
Applications on App Engine."

00:00:05.033 --> 00:00:07.033
I know it's a session,
getting late in the day,

00:00:07.033 --> 00:00:09.033
and there's been a lot
of excitement today,

00:00:09.033 --> 00:00:10.701
but, um, we have a, um,

00:00:10.701 --> 00:00:13.200
a number of things
we're excited to talk about,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.200
and, uh, hopefully,
we'll be able to,

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.734
even in the late afternoon,
keep your attention.

00:00:17.734 --> 00:00:20.734
Um, so building enterprise
applications on App Engine--

00:00:20.734 --> 00:00:23.234
specifically what we're
gonna be talking about today

00:00:23.234 --> 00:00:25.234
is, um, why this year
is becoming,

00:00:25.234 --> 00:00:27.234
um, the best time to build

00:00:27.234 --> 00:00:29.901
enterprise applications
on App Engine.

00:00:29.901 --> 00:00:31.901
Um, my name is Greg D'Alesandre.

00:00:31.901 --> 00:00:34.400
I'm a senior product manager
on Google App Engine.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.400
Schalk: And my name
is Chris Schalk.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.901
I'm a developer advocate
on Google App Engine.

00:00:38.901 --> 00:00:40.901
Okay, I got it right there.

00:00:40.901 --> 00:00:42.901
And, uh, so just to get started,

00:00:42.901 --> 00:00:45.234
I wanted to give you guys
a little bit of information.

00:00:45.234 --> 00:00:47.901
Uh, there's my Twitter handle,
so feel free to--you can follow,

00:00:47.901 --> 00:00:49.400
uh, and of course--

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.434
D'Alesandre: I still use e-mail.
I'm--I'm old school.

00:00:51.434 --> 00:00:53.400
Schalk: Yeah, so feel free
to shoot him some e-mail.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.067
And, uh, if you're ever--
if you're a little bit confused

00:00:56.067 --> 00:00:58.734
where you're at, we have this
handy, uh, session short link.

00:00:58.734 --> 00:01:00.801
You can click on that,
and that actually tells you

00:01:00.801 --> 00:01:02.801
you are here watching our show.

00:01:02.801 --> 00:01:04.801
Um, we have our
hash tags, as well,

00:01:04.801 --> 00:01:06.801
and, of course,
the session feedback.

00:01:06.801 --> 00:01:09.801
So, cool, guess we'll jump
right into our presentation.

00:01:09.801 --> 00:01:11.801
Um, so mainly, the presentation

00:01:11.801 --> 00:01:13.801
today that we've put together

00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:16.300
is essentially--
the high level is,

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.300
we're wanting to convey
the trajectory of App Engine,

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.968
where it is today,

00:01:20.968 --> 00:01:23.968
and how it's essentially heading
in an enterprise direction.

00:01:23.968 --> 00:01:25.968
So to do that,
what we're doing is,

00:01:25.968 --> 00:01:27.968
I'm gonna go ahead
and give you through--

00:01:27.968 --> 00:01:30.467
step you through a brief
history of App Engine.

00:01:30.467 --> 00:01:32.467
So how many people here
are currently

00:01:32.467 --> 00:01:34.467
using App Engine today?

00:01:34.467 --> 00:01:37.133
Cool. And how many people
are not using App Engine yet,

00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:39.133
but are still looking at--
Okay, good.

00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:41.133
So we definitely want to speak
to you guys, as well,

00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:43.133
and if you guys are--
are from the enterprise--

00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:45.133
how many enterprise--
would you consider yourselves

00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:47.133
enterprise developers?
Okay, exactly.

00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:49.601
So I think we've got
a good crowd here,

00:01:49.601 --> 00:01:52.100
at least for the stuff
that we're gonna try to cover.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.601
So anyway, for folks who are not
familiar with the history,

00:01:54.601 --> 00:01:56.267
I'm gonna give you
some history.

00:01:56.267 --> 00:01:58.267
I'm also going
to hand it over to Greg,

00:01:58.267 --> 00:02:00.267
so he can actually get
into a little bit more detail

00:02:00.267 --> 00:02:02.167
in what we are
announcing today.

00:02:02.167 --> 00:02:04.767
You may have actually seen,
uh, something on our blog,

00:02:04.767 --> 00:02:07.601
but, uh, we'll be getting
into more specifics about that.

00:02:07.601 --> 00:02:10.601
Um, I'm gonna also talk about
the App Engine for business,

00:02:10.601 --> 00:02:13.601
uh, technology
that we announced last year,

00:02:13.601 --> 00:02:15.601
and explain, essentially,

00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:18.100
what we learned
from that whole program,

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.434
and how it actually pulled us
to where we are here today.

00:02:21.434 --> 00:02:24.200
Um, and then finally,
we have some key partners

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.000
that we're gonna invite
up onstage,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and they're gonna give us
a little bit of, like,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.834
their experience
with App Engine,

00:02:29.834 --> 00:02:32.934
and also the overall, um,
what their experiences were,

00:02:32.934 --> 00:02:35.033
especially for App Engine
for Business and so forth.

00:02:35.033 --> 00:02:37.033
And that's pretty much what
we're going to be doing

00:02:37.033 --> 00:02:39.033
for today, so we'll
go ahead and jump into it.

00:02:39.033 --> 00:02:41.434
So let's look back
a few years--

00:02:41.434 --> 00:02:44.267
a long time ago--
just three years ago, actually,

00:02:44.267 --> 00:02:46.267
um, when we launched
App Engine.

00:02:46.267 --> 00:02:48.334
So we literally just passed

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:50.334
our 3-year birthday, um,

00:02:50.334 --> 00:02:52.834
so it's relatively young/

00:02:52.834 --> 00:02:56.033
But, um, as you can see in a lot
of these different features,

00:02:56.033 --> 00:02:57.868
we've been continuously, uh,

00:02:57.868 --> 00:03:00.033
putting out some really
excellent features,

00:03:00.033 --> 00:03:01.934
and getting a lot
of great feedback.

00:03:01.934 --> 00:03:03.934
So I'd kind of like
to summarize, like,

00:03:03.934 --> 00:03:06.601
our last 3 years as,
obviously, 2008 was a--

00:03:06.601 --> 00:03:09.601
the major milestone was actually
launching App Engine.

00:03:09.601 --> 00:03:12.100
Um, and then moving on to 2009,

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.100
we had a general over, uh,

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.100
overall platform expansion,

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.100
especially with the launching
of the Java Runtime.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.100
How many people here--I think
I've got a pretty good idea,

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.801
but, anyway, for folks
coming from the enterprise,

00:03:25.801 --> 00:03:27.801
Java is obviously key,

00:03:27.801 --> 00:03:30.801
and, uh, I actually come from
Java and enterprise, as well,

00:03:30.801 --> 00:03:33.801
so that was also when I, uh,
came into the App Engine team,

00:03:33.801 --> 00:03:37.067
and so that was obviously
extremely important, as well.

00:03:37.067 --> 00:03:40.033
And then, of course,
moving on into 2010,

00:03:40.033 --> 00:03:43.033
uh, we had a series
of limitations removed,

00:03:43.033 --> 00:03:45.701
just essentially making
the overall platform,

00:03:45.701 --> 00:03:47.701
uh, more user-friendly,

00:03:47.701 --> 00:03:49.701
more adaptable and pluggable

00:03:49.701 --> 00:03:51.734
into a lot
of different technologies,

00:03:51.734 --> 00:03:54.234
and essentially more liberal,
I guess, in that way.

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:56.234
Um, 10 minute Tasks,
for example--

00:03:56.234 --> 00:03:58.133
that's obviously a great
improvement for people

00:03:58.133 --> 00:04:00.133
who were having to do,
like, long-running tasks.

00:04:00.133 --> 00:04:02.200
Uh, Channel API, even,
for doing some cool

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.501
comment type of interactions
with browsers.

00:04:04.501 --> 00:04:06.501
And, of course, 2011, uh,

00:04:06.501 --> 00:04:09.501
we have the High-Replication
Datastore, which we launched,

00:04:09.501 --> 00:04:12.501
and we're getting extremely
positive feedback so far,

00:04:12.501 --> 00:04:14.501
so positive that we actually
have an announcement

00:04:14.501 --> 00:04:16.501
that we'll be talking about
later today.

00:04:16.501 --> 00:04:19.501
We even have one of our partners
that was one of our key partners

00:04:19.501 --> 00:04:22.000
in helping us, uh,
with the early adoption

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
of a High-Replication datastore.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.667
And, of course, today,

00:04:26.667 --> 00:04:28.667
we also introduce
some really cool features.

00:04:28.667 --> 00:04:31.000
So in the current version
of 1.5.0,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.501
uh, we have this new technology
called Backends--

00:04:33.501 --> 00:04:35.501
D'Alesandre: And, uh,
if you can go back in time,

00:04:35.501 --> 00:04:38.501
there was a talk about two hours
ago on Backends, so...

00:04:38.501 --> 00:04:41.000
Schalk: That's right.
So, exactly.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Um, Backends,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.033
if you're just
learning about it today,

00:04:45.033 --> 00:04:47.968
if you ever wanted to run,
like, a continuous process,

00:04:47.968 --> 00:04:49.968
have, like, say a search engine,

00:04:49.968 --> 00:04:52.467
or just essentially, any kind
of, like, a demon process,

00:04:52.467 --> 00:04:54.133
that is what you get
with Backends,

00:04:54.133 --> 00:04:56.133
so definitely some
cool technology.

00:04:56.133 --> 00:04:58.634
Pull Queues is also another
technology that we've, uh,

00:04:58.634 --> 00:05:00.634
introduced today
with the latest version,

00:05:00.634 --> 00:05:03.701
so you can essentially
string up a series of tasks,

00:05:03.701 --> 00:05:06.100
and line them up
and let them execute,

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.100
and they will execute,
essentially,

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.100
as they're ready
to be, uh, executed.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.601
And then, of course,
the big change

00:05:13.601 --> 00:05:16.534
that we're introducing today
is High-Replication datastore

00:05:16.534 --> 00:05:19.200
is actually becoming
the default technology,

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.200
and this is coming
as a result

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.200
of an abundance
of empirical information.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.701
Um, all of our trusted
testers out there,

00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:29.267
uh, and even our own work
with the technology,

00:05:29.267 --> 00:05:31.267
is just really proving to be

00:05:31.267 --> 00:05:34.267
a highly reliable architecture
for data storage.

00:05:34.267 --> 00:05:36.267
Okay.

00:05:36.267 --> 00:05:39.267
And then, before we kind of
jump in a little bit more

00:05:39.267 --> 00:05:42.267
on some, like, overall metrics
that Greg's gonna jump into,

00:05:42.267 --> 00:05:44.267
uh, I always like
to pull up a slide

00:05:44.267 --> 00:05:46.000
just to kind of give you
a general feel

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.267
for our overall partners,
and especially in this context.

00:05:49.267 --> 00:05:52.267
You may not see a bunch
of enterprise, uh, companies,

00:05:52.267 --> 00:05:54.934
but we actually partner
with a lot of companies

00:05:54.934 --> 00:05:57.934
who are directly relating
with enterprise companies.

00:05:57.934 --> 00:06:00.434
Uh, I mean, sure, there are
some enterprise companies

00:06:00.434 --> 00:06:02.501
there, like Best Buy
and some other guys,

00:06:02.501 --> 00:06:04.667
where we actually interface
with them quite a bit,

00:06:04.667 --> 00:06:07.167
where they may not run
their entire infrastructure

00:06:07.167 --> 00:06:10.167
on App Engine today,
but they are now experimenting

00:06:10.167 --> 00:06:12.167
and taking core components

00:06:12.167 --> 00:06:15.167
of their overall
architectural, um,

00:06:15.167 --> 00:06:17.167
enterprise architecture,

00:06:17.167 --> 00:06:20.100
and pulling in and replacing it
with App Engine components.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.167
In that sense,
we find App Engine

00:06:22.167 --> 00:06:24.200
extremely pluggable technology
in larger,

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.801
heterogeneous types of, uh,
enterprise architectures.

00:06:26.801 --> 00:06:29.467
Um, but, yes, you can see
from--from our partners,

00:06:29.467 --> 00:06:32.467
that we have more of our
also traditional partners

00:06:32.467 --> 00:06:34.467
that came when we launched.

00:06:34.467 --> 00:06:37.133
So Social, Gaming, Mobile,
all that kind of stuff--

00:06:37.133 --> 00:06:39.133
and all those guys
are still quite happy,

00:06:39.133 --> 00:06:41.634
and continuing to crank out
some really cool stuff.

00:06:41.634 --> 00:06:43.634
Okay, so let me hand it over
to, uh, Greg.

00:06:43.634 --> 00:06:45.634
He's gonna talk a little bit
about our growth,

00:06:45.634 --> 00:06:47.634
and, uh, and where
we are today.

00:06:47.634 --> 00:06:49.400
D'Alesandre: So as you
can imagine,

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.400
with all of the things that, um,
Chris was just talking about

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.400
that we've been doing
over the years, um,

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.000
a number of people have decided
they wanted to use App Engine,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.934
and this, uh, this curve
is exactly the kind of thing

00:06:58.934 --> 00:07:00.534
we love to see.

00:07:00.534 --> 00:07:04.133
Um, as of today, there are over
100,000 active developers

00:07:04.133 --> 00:07:06.868
every month
using App Engine.

00:07:06.868 --> 00:07:09.567
Um, there's over 200,000

00:07:09.567 --> 00:07:11.567
active applications every week.

00:07:11.567 --> 00:07:13.567
Now when we say
"active applications,"

00:07:13.567 --> 00:07:16.567
we don't just mean somebody
built a HelloWorld app

00:07:16.567 --> 00:07:18.234
to see how it was,

00:07:18.234 --> 00:07:20.400
and--and count that
as an application.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.901
We actually mean
200,000 applications

00:07:22.901 --> 00:07:25.300
that are serving traffic
every week.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.300
We also serve, um,

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.300
over 1.5 billion
pageviews per day.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.300
Um, to give you a sense
and a scale of this--

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.300
Schalk: Can I repeat
something really quickly?

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.300
D'Alesandre: Of course.
Schalk: Per day,

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.000
so let me interrupt
for a second.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.467
D'Alesandre: To give you
a scale of how quickly

00:07:41.467 --> 00:07:44.133
we've been growing,
I believe last year at I/O,

00:07:44.133 --> 00:07:46.601
we announced half a billion
pageviews per day,

00:07:46.601 --> 00:07:48.601
or over half a billion
pageviews per day.

00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:51.133
Um, then in December,
we started talking about,

00:07:51.133 --> 00:07:53.133
we were over a billion
pageviews per day,

00:07:53.133 --> 00:07:56.167
and now in May, we're--
it is May--yes--

00:07:56.167 --> 00:07:58.167
now in May, we're over
a billion and a half.

00:07:58.167 --> 00:08:01.234
So that's the--that's the tra--
the growth trajectory that, uh,

00:08:01.234 --> 00:08:02.901
App Engine has been on.

00:08:02.901 --> 00:08:05.901
Um, also wanted to call out
a specific, uh--

00:08:05.901 --> 00:08:08.868
well, a specific wedding
that happened recently,

00:08:08.868 --> 00:08:10.868
um, but, uh, more specifically,

00:08:10.868 --> 00:08:13.868
uh, App Engine, um,
served a few apps

00:08:13.868 --> 00:08:16.200
for, uh, the official
Royal Wedding,

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.200
um, and we--
we, uh,

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.300
we were excited about doing it

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.434
primarily because
it really showed, um,

00:08:22.434 --> 00:08:25.501
the kind of traffic
that App Engine can serve

00:08:25.501 --> 00:08:27.501
in a really short
amount of time.

00:08:27.501 --> 00:08:29.501
Um, on wedding day, uh,

00:08:29.501 --> 00:08:32.501
we served up to 32,000
requests per second

00:08:32.501 --> 00:08:35.000
on one of the apps
that we were using.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.534
Um, they--sorry, one of the apps
that we were running.

00:08:37.534 --> 00:08:39.534
Um, 37.7 million pageviews,

00:08:39.534 --> 00:08:41.534
13.7 million visitors,

00:08:41.534 --> 00:08:43.534
and the best part
of all of this is,

00:08:43.534 --> 00:08:46.200
this ran, um, without us having

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.801
to build a completely
new stack for them,

00:08:48.801 --> 00:08:50.801
or to go totally out of our way

00:08:50.801 --> 00:08:53.367
to make this practical
and feasible.

00:08:53.367 --> 00:08:56.367
This ran on the same
infrastructure, um,

00:08:56.367 --> 00:08:58.734
that is shared between
all App Engine apps.

00:08:58.734 --> 00:09:00.400
And hopefully,
no one saw anything

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.067
really slow during that time.
[laughs]

00:09:02.067 --> 00:09:04.567
Schalk: Yeah, and I think
the main thing there is, like,

00:09:04.567 --> 00:09:06.567
sure, these are just numbers,
but, you know,

00:09:06.567 --> 00:09:08.234
in an enterprise context,
you know,

00:09:08.234 --> 00:09:10.067
enterprises can actually
feel secure

00:09:10.067 --> 00:09:12.067
that they have a truly scalable,
to massive numbers--

00:09:12.067 --> 00:09:14.067
both in traffic
as well as daily requests

00:09:14.067 --> 00:09:15.667
and stuff like that, so...

00:09:15.667 --> 00:09:17.667
D'Alesandre: Exactly. And so,
you know, that's all great--

00:09:17.667 --> 00:09:20.334
so we've been through--
we've had a few years, um,

00:09:20.334 --> 00:09:23.334
that we've been going through,
of building out features that,

00:09:23.334 --> 00:09:25.734
um, gaining traction,
getting a lot of traffic.

00:09:25.734 --> 00:09:28.234
Um, what this all leads us
up to today

00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:30.734
is that App Engine
is actually going to be

00:09:30.734 --> 00:09:32.567
leaving preview
later this year.

00:09:32.567 --> 00:09:35.000
Um, leaving preview
is a massive step for us,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
because it's essentially saying

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.367
that Google is completely
behind App Engine,

00:09:39.367 --> 00:09:41.367
that they feel
it's a product

00:09:41.367 --> 00:09:43.367
that we want moving forward.

00:09:43.367 --> 00:09:46.367
Um, drilling down into some
of the details around this,

00:09:46.367 --> 00:09:49.367
um, leaving preview
means a full Google product.

00:09:49.367 --> 00:09:51.734
This includes 3-year
deprecation support.

00:09:51.734 --> 00:09:54.400
So when we talk about
deprecation support,

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.400
what we essentially mean
is that even if we, um,

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.400
decide that we're no longer
going to, um,

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.834
continue development
on one of our APIs

00:10:02.834 --> 00:10:04.667
or even App Engine as a whole,

00:10:04.667 --> 00:10:06.667
we'll still continue
to support it and run it

00:10:06.667 --> 00:10:08.501
for three years
down the road.

00:10:08.501 --> 00:10:10.834
And I know it's a little weird
to talk about--

00:10:10.834 --> 00:10:13.334
um, I know it's a little weird
to talk about deprecation

00:10:13.334 --> 00:10:15.334
right when we're about
to launch a product,

00:10:15.334 --> 00:10:17.334
but we also know that
one of the main things

00:10:17.334 --> 00:10:19.834
that enterprises and businesses
worry about is that--

00:10:19.834 --> 00:10:22.834
is that they don't want
to be betting on a platform,

00:10:22.834 --> 00:10:24.834
be building on top
of a platform,

00:10:24.834 --> 00:10:27.167
and worry that it might
just disappear tomorrow.

00:10:27.167 --> 00:10:28.834
Schalk: That kind of reminds me,

00:10:28.834 --> 00:10:30.834
what product did you
work on previously?

00:10:30.834 --> 00:10:32.834
D'Alesandre: Google Wave.
Why do you ask?

00:10:32.834 --> 00:10:34.834
Schalk: Oh, okay, never mind.
I was just kidding. Yeah.

00:10:34.834 --> 00:10:37.834
D'Alesandre: Um, anyway--um, so
we know that this is a concern,

00:10:37.834 --> 00:10:39.834
and this is why we think
it's so important, um,

00:10:39.834 --> 00:10:41.501
that we come out of preview

00:10:41.501 --> 00:10:43.501
and become a full
Google product.

00:10:43.501 --> 00:10:45.501
Um, so this--

00:10:45.501 --> 00:10:47.501
when we come
out of preview,

00:10:47.501 --> 00:10:50.501
this will also include
a 99.95% SLA,

00:10:50.501 --> 00:10:52.334
um, for all paid users.

00:10:52.334 --> 00:10:54.834
Um, Chris will talk
a little bit more about this,

00:10:54.834 --> 00:10:57.334
but last year, we were--
when we talked about App Engine

00:10:57.334 --> 00:10:59.334
for business, we said that, um,

00:10:59.334 --> 00:11:01.801
there's going to be an SLA
with App Engine for business.

00:11:01.801 --> 00:11:03.434
When it came down to it,

00:11:03.434 --> 00:11:05.801
we just realized all paid users
should get an SLA.

00:11:05.801 --> 00:11:08.701
Operational and developer
support available,

00:11:08.701 --> 00:11:10.701
um, a new business-friendly
terms of service--

00:11:10.701 --> 00:11:12.701
billing by invoice--
the kinds of things

00:11:12.701 --> 00:11:14.701
that you would expect
coming from a business.

00:11:14.701 --> 00:11:16.701
Um, rounded out feature set,

00:11:16.701 --> 00:11:18.701
including Frontend
and Backend capabilities,

00:11:18.701 --> 00:11:21.601
and a new sustainable
pricing model.

00:11:21.601 --> 00:11:24.601
So, um, just to dive
a little bit more into the SLA,

00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:27.100
um, when we talk about an SLA,

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.100
it's important to us, um,

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.100
to really be as transparent
as possible

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.100
about what
we're trying to measure.

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:35.100
So for instance, um, uh--

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:37.434
well, and I guess for the sake
of transparency,

00:11:37.434 --> 00:11:39.267
the SLA is only going to cover

00:11:39.267 --> 00:11:41.267
High-Replication datastore
applications.

00:11:41.267 --> 00:11:43.834
Um, we, uh, we--
High-Replication datastore,

00:11:43.834 --> 00:11:45.834
um, as Chris mentioned,
is now the default

00:11:45.834 --> 00:11:48.834
for all applications today,
and we know we can count on it.

00:11:48.834 --> 00:11:51.834
Um, but High-Replication
datastore--

00:11:51.834 --> 00:11:53.501
and I'm going to start
saying HRD--

00:11:53.501 --> 00:11:55.501
Schalk: Yeah, I like that.
D'Alesandre: HRD does not need--

00:11:55.501 --> 00:11:57.501
Schalk: Dan started us on that,
so we're good with it.

00:11:57.501 --> 00:11:59.033
D'Alesandre: Yeah, exactly...

00:11:59.033 --> 00:12:01.601
Um, so it doesn't need
planned downtime,

00:12:01.601 --> 00:12:03.100
so when we talked about
an SLA,

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.267
we're not saying this is the SLA
outside of the planned downtimes

00:12:06.267 --> 00:12:08.934
you're obviously going
to have to absorb anyway.

00:12:08.934 --> 00:12:10.734
Um, uptime is going
to be measured

00:12:10.734 --> 00:12:13.534
by thousands of various probes
from around the globe,

00:12:13.534 --> 00:12:16.834
so it's not just us saying,
well, within out data center,

00:12:16.834 --> 00:12:19.834
um, that we're looking at,
everything looks fine.

00:12:19.834 --> 00:12:22.834
Um, we're also, um,
working on a way

00:12:22.834 --> 00:12:24.667
to give customers a way

00:12:24.667 --> 00:12:27.067
to contribute their metrics
back to us,

00:12:27.067 --> 00:12:29.734
so that it's not just us
monitoring ourselves,

00:12:29.734 --> 00:12:31.767
but essentially,
all of the applications

00:12:31.767 --> 00:12:34.300
that you're running
are also monitoring our service,

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:36.300
and then feeding
that data back to us.

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.968
Um, last thing I wanted
to mention about this

00:12:38.968 --> 00:12:41.968
is, um, there is an upcoming
monitoring API

00:12:41.968 --> 00:12:44.968
that we're actually
going into trusted tester,

00:12:44.968 --> 00:12:46.801
um, as of today,

00:12:46.801 --> 00:12:49.300
to automatically monitor
your own applications.

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.300
Um, so this is really, um--

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.300
we understand that
what businesses need

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.300
and what enterprises need is--

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.300
is more transparency into what
their application is doing,

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.801
being able to monitor that,

00:13:00.801 --> 00:13:02.868
and being able
to trust that it's--

00:13:02.868 --> 00:13:05.400
that it's actually going
to be staying up.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:08.367
Um, there are two sessions
that I want to highlight.

00:13:08.367 --> 00:13:11.367
Uh, if you're interested
in learning more about this,

00:13:11.367 --> 00:13:13.367
"More 9s Please" is, uh,

00:13:13.367 --> 00:13:16.367
both these sessions are
tomorrow--no time travel needed.

00:13:16.367 --> 00:13:19.367
Um, "More 9s Please" and
"Life in App Engine Production"

00:13:19.367 --> 00:13:22.133
are two sessions that
will help you understand

00:13:22.133 --> 00:13:25.133
both how we run things
on the Backend,

00:13:25.133 --> 00:13:26.767
as well as, um,

00:13:26.767 --> 00:13:28.767
how the High-Replication
datastore works,

00:13:28.767 --> 00:13:31.767
so that when we say
that we're giving 3 1/2 9s

00:13:31.767 --> 00:13:33.767
as an SLA for it,

00:13:33.767 --> 00:13:36.767
why we can
be confident in that number.

00:13:36.767 --> 00:13:38.801
All right,
Frontends and Backends.

00:13:38.801 --> 00:13:41.767
So we talked about,
as we leave preview,

00:13:41.767 --> 00:13:44.767
Frontends and Backends
are an integral part of this.

00:13:44.767 --> 00:13:47.767
Um, this is because the, um,
over the years,

00:13:47.767 --> 00:13:50.267
all of the feedback
that we've gotten

00:13:50.267 --> 00:13:53.267
in terms of, uh,
both the way code runs

00:13:53.267 --> 00:13:56.267
and the way we bill
for that code,

00:13:56.267 --> 00:13:59.267
uh, essentially had been leading
us up to a point of,

00:13:59.267 --> 00:14:02.334
we actually need to have
a better sense of both CPU

00:14:02.334 --> 00:14:05.300
and memory that
applications are using.

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:06.968
Um, so what we're doing is--

00:14:06.968 --> 00:14:08.968
Frontends and Backends
have instances.

00:14:08.968 --> 00:14:10.968
This is essentially
the running unit.

00:14:10.968 --> 00:14:12.968
It's a set amount
of CPU in memory.

00:14:12.968 --> 00:14:14.968
It's what runs your code.

00:14:14.968 --> 00:14:17.968
Um, if you're already an App Eng
user--App Engine user--

00:14:17.968 --> 00:14:19.968
you're probably, um,
accustomed to this.

00:14:19.968 --> 00:14:21.801
If you're running Java,

00:14:21.801 --> 00:14:24.801
it's basically
a JVM running your code.

00:14:24.801 --> 00:14:27.300
Um, so Frontends
use these instances,

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.968
but they scale them dynamically
based on traffic.

00:14:29.968 --> 00:14:32.968
The App Engine scheduler
determines when to spin up

00:14:32.968 --> 00:14:35.968
and down, um, Frontend instances
based on your traffic.

00:14:35.968 --> 00:14:38.968
There's an algorithm
that we talk--

00:14:38.968 --> 00:14:41.968
spoke of earlier--
in a session earlier today,

00:14:41.968 --> 00:14:44.968
um, about how to scale
your application,

00:14:44.968 --> 00:14:46.968
that essentially,
the algorithm we use

00:14:46.968 --> 00:14:49.968
has something to do with
the latency of your application

00:14:49.968 --> 00:14:51.968
and the number of--
and essentially the, uh,

00:14:51.968 --> 00:14:54.968
the latency of requests
coming in.

00:14:54.968 --> 00:14:57.968
Um, one of the things
we are going to be doing,

00:14:57.968 --> 00:14:59.968
because we know that instances

00:14:59.968 --> 00:15:02.033
are a really important concept,

00:15:02.033 --> 00:15:04.701
um, we're going to be putting
some controls in place

00:15:04.701 --> 00:15:06.701
to allow customers to optimize

00:15:06.701 --> 00:15:08.701
the scheduler
for their particular usage.

00:15:08.701 --> 00:15:11.400
So for instance, um,
if you'd rather

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.400
tailor your instance usage

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.067
so that it spins up
instances very quickly,

00:15:16.067 --> 00:15:19.067
because you always want
really snappy response,

00:15:19.067 --> 00:15:21.067
you'll be able to do that.

00:15:21.067 --> 00:15:23.067
Uh, so then there's Backends.

00:15:23.067 --> 00:15:25.334
Backends are launching today
with 1.5.0,

00:15:25.334 --> 00:15:27.334
as we briefly discussed.

00:15:27.334 --> 00:15:30.334
Um, the main difference is they
run based on admin control,

00:15:30.334 --> 00:15:32.834
so admins can start them,
stop them,

00:15:32.834 --> 00:15:35.834
uh, they can set them
to be dynamically started,

00:15:35.834 --> 00:15:38.334
um, when requests come in.

00:15:38.334 --> 00:15:40.667
The other thing you can do
with Backends

00:15:40.667 --> 00:15:42.667
is choose CPU
and memory size.

00:15:42.667 --> 00:15:44.667
Um, this, again,
is really important,

00:15:44.667 --> 00:15:47.000
if, um, if you're trying
to run something

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.667
that is very memory intensive--

00:15:48.667 --> 00:15:51.701
Um, and they're all also
long-running processes.

00:15:51.701 --> 00:15:54.667
So that's essentially the upshot
of Frontends and Backends.

00:15:54.667 --> 00:15:56.667
Um, all right,

00:15:56.667 --> 00:15:58.667
so new pricing model overview--

00:15:58.667 --> 00:16:01.133
Now I know this is actually
a really important

00:16:01.133 --> 00:16:03.601
and really impactful
aspect of leaving preview.

00:16:03.601 --> 00:16:06.601
Um, essentially, again,
taking the feedback we had

00:16:06.601 --> 00:16:10.133
from, um, from the three years
we've been running App Engine,

00:16:10.133 --> 00:16:12.767
uh, there's a couple big--
pretty big changes we made.

00:16:12.767 --> 00:16:14.534
One is in usage types.

00:16:14.534 --> 00:16:16.534
So today, we have free apps

00:16:16.534 --> 00:16:18.534
that you can run forever,

00:16:18.534 --> 00:16:21.534
um, to try out App Engine,
to see how it runs,

00:16:21.534 --> 00:16:23.534
even to have a couple apps--

00:16:23.534 --> 00:16:25.400
I know people who run
their web sites

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.033
and things like that on it.

00:16:27.033 --> 00:16:29.534
Um, we feel that's really,
really important and critical,

00:16:29.534 --> 00:16:32.534
uh, to allow people to try out
App Engine and use it.

00:16:32.534 --> 00:16:35.534
There's still going to be
free apps--that's not changing,

00:16:35.534 --> 00:16:37.534
um, very similar
to what they are today.

00:16:37.534 --> 00:16:39.434
Um, the quotas are going to be--

00:16:39.434 --> 00:16:42.434
are going to go down somewhat,
um, on those free apps,

00:16:42.434 --> 00:16:45.434
but again, the goal is
you should be able to run, um,

00:16:45.434 --> 00:16:48.434
an app on App Engine
for free forever.

00:16:48.434 --> 00:16:51.434
Paid apps are actually similar
to what we have today

00:16:51.434 --> 00:16:54.434
in terms of apps that have
"billing enabled."

00:16:54.434 --> 00:16:57.434
In other words, you can pay
for scaling on paid apps.

00:16:57.434 --> 00:17:00.434
Um, they do cost $9 per month,

00:17:00.434 --> 00:17:02.501
um, in addition to the usage,

00:17:02.501 --> 00:17:05.000
but that also
now includes an SLA.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Um, and then lastly, there's--
there are premier accounts,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
and this is $500
per account per month,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.501
um, in addition
to the usage you use,

00:17:13.501 --> 00:17:16.501
but this includes
operational support.

00:17:16.501 --> 00:17:19.501
Again, um, operational support
is really important,

00:17:19.501 --> 00:17:21.501
because one of the pieces
of feedback

00:17:21.501 --> 00:17:24.501
we get from our customers
is they like what we build,

00:17:24.501 --> 00:17:26.267
they want to use it,

00:17:26.267 --> 00:17:28.634
and the two major pieces
of feedback we often get

00:17:28.634 --> 00:17:30.634
are, "We don't want it
to go away."

00:17:30.634 --> 00:17:33.634
Um, and in fact, when we talk
to a number of our customers

00:17:33.634 --> 00:17:36.200
about this, uh,
about leaving preview--

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.801
we sent them an e-mail and said,

00:17:37.801 --> 00:17:39.801
"Hey, we have something we want
to talk to you about."

00:17:39.801 --> 00:17:41.501
Then we got on the phone,
and they were like,

00:17:41.501 --> 00:17:43.200
"Don't tell us App Engine
is being canceled."

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.701
Schalk: Yeah, that was the--

00:17:44.701 --> 00:17:46.701
D'Alesandre: And, uh,
we didn't, we told 'em we were

00:17:46.701 --> 00:17:48.701
leaving preview, which everyone
was much more excited about.

00:17:48.701 --> 00:17:50.501
Schalk: Yeah. I was partially
at fault for that--

00:17:50.501 --> 00:17:52.200
"I kind of have
an important announcement,

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.200
that we need to talk
with you very soon."

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.200
And so... [laughs]
Doom and gloom.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.734
D'Alesandre: Um, but, um,
the second thing

00:17:58.734 --> 00:18:01.400
that we constantly hear
from our customers, um,

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.400
is they want to be able to have
guaranteed response time

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.901
from someone within Google
to be able to answer questions,

00:18:07.901 --> 00:18:10.901
um, especially if there's
operational issues,

00:18:10.901 --> 00:18:13.067
potential downtime
on their application

00:18:13.067 --> 00:18:14.734
that they don't understand.

00:18:14.734 --> 00:18:16.501
They want to be able
to ask somebody a question

00:18:16.501 --> 00:18:18.000
and get a guaranteed response.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Schalk: And I can probably
highlight that a little bit,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.868
because obviously, if you've
worked with App Engine,

00:18:21.868 --> 00:18:23.868
you have the forums, but then
sometimes you're lucky enough,

00:18:23.868 --> 00:18:25.434
like some key people
here that know

00:18:25.434 --> 00:18:26.934
some people's e-mail addresses,

00:18:26.934 --> 00:18:28.934
and so for those guys,
we've been actually pretty good,

00:18:28.934 --> 00:18:30.934
but we actually feel guilty
because there's thousands

00:18:30.934 --> 00:18:32.934
of people out there that
we obviously just can't cover

00:18:32.934 --> 00:18:35.267
from our own, you know,
sheer number of hours per day,

00:18:35.267 --> 00:18:37.734
and so we're really happy
that we're actually

00:18:37.734 --> 00:18:39.934
putting this program together
and launching it

00:18:39.934 --> 00:18:41.934
for a full operational support
that it should be, so...

00:18:41.934 --> 00:18:43.601
D'Alesandre: Indeed.
And, in fact,

00:18:43.601 --> 00:18:46.000
this operational support program
is currently

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
in trusted tester today.
Schalk: Yeah.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
D'Alesandre: Um, the other thing
you get with premier accounts

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
I should mention is,
as many apps as you want,

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.501
and all of them can scale,

00:18:53.501 --> 00:18:56.000
and you don't pay
per-app fees for those.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.067
Um, second big change--
no more CPU hours.

00:18:59.067 --> 00:19:01.200
I know CPU hours, uh,

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.367
were--were elegant
in their simplicity.

00:19:04.367 --> 00:19:07.000
Um, unfortunately,
they did have a downside,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
in terms of people
who were trying

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
to do memory-intensive
applications.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Um, or people
who had applications

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
that just had
very high latency.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.501
Um, we didn't necessarily
know how to tackle

00:19:17.501 --> 00:19:20.501
some of these applications,
because essentially, all we did

00:19:20.501 --> 00:19:23.501
is charge for CPU,
um, so instead,

00:19:23.501 --> 00:19:25.501
we're going to be charging
for size and number

00:19:25.501 --> 00:19:27.601
of running Frontends
and Backends,

00:19:27.601 --> 00:19:29.601
and this incorporates
CPU and memory,

00:19:29.601 --> 00:19:31.200
as I spoke about before.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.200
Um, so essentially,
anytime your code is running,

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.701
um, we're going to be charging
for the size.

00:19:36.701 --> 00:19:38.367
Um, APIs,

00:19:38.367 --> 00:19:40.801
which today,
we're charging CPU hours for,

00:19:40.801 --> 00:19:43.300
instead, we're going to actually
be just charging

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:45.300
based on
the operations themselves.

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:47.267
So if you're using
the Channel API,

00:19:47.267 --> 00:19:49.767
and, um, and you, uh,

00:19:49.767 --> 00:19:51.434
you open up ten channels,

00:19:51.434 --> 00:19:53.434
we charge you
for ten channels opened.

00:19:53.434 --> 00:19:55.934
Um, we will charge you
for ten channels opened.

00:19:55.934 --> 00:19:57.934
Today, if you open up
ten channels,

00:19:57.934 --> 00:20:00.434
we translate that into the CPU
that it takes us,

00:20:00.434 --> 00:20:02.434
and then charge you
for that CPU.

00:20:02.434 --> 00:20:04.267
Um, part of the reason
we did this

00:20:04.267 --> 00:20:06.601
was because we wanted
a much more transparent way

00:20:06.601 --> 00:20:09.601
for people to estimate what
their actual bills would be,

00:20:09.601 --> 00:20:11.601
um, and as we get, uh--

00:20:11.601 --> 00:20:14.601
there's, um--with the blog post
that Chris mentioned today,

00:20:14.601 --> 00:20:17.100
there's a detailed list
of the operations

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:18.767
and the cost for those,

00:20:18.767 --> 00:20:21.400
and as we get closer and closer
to leaving preview,

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:24.400
more information will be
available about some of those.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.400
And then the last thing
is add-ons.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.400
Um, I say, for example,

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:31.400
SSL for custom domains will be
available for a monthly fee,

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:34.400
um, because we know that this
is a very, very,

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.901
um, heavily desired

00:20:36.901 --> 00:20:38.601
feature for App Engine.

00:20:38.601 --> 00:20:40.601
People tell us this every day.
Schalk: Yep.

00:20:40.601 --> 00:20:42.901
D'Alesandre: Um, and we're
working on it every day.

00:20:42.901 --> 00:20:45.901
Um, it's, in fact, one of our
top priorities to work on.

00:20:45.901 --> 00:20:48.901
Um, unfortunately,
we don't have a specific date

00:20:48.901 --> 00:20:51.901
that we can say when it'll--
when it will launch.

00:20:51.901 --> 00:20:53.901
Um, that being said,
when it is launched,

00:20:53.901 --> 00:20:55.901
it'll be available
for a monthly fee,

00:20:55.901 --> 00:20:58.901
partially because it uses
a resource--IP addresses--

00:20:58.901 --> 00:21:01.968
um, that is--that we can't just
sort of pay usage-based.

00:21:01.968 --> 00:21:04.968
Um, that being said,
we heard loud and clear

00:21:04.968 --> 00:21:06.968
that people loved
usage-based modeling,

00:21:06.968 --> 00:21:08.968
so that's why, um,

00:21:08.968 --> 00:21:11.968
everything else
is going to be usage-based.

00:21:11.968 --> 00:21:14.968
So this is a list
of the prices we have.

00:21:14.968 --> 00:21:16.601
One of the things that I--
or, excuse me,

00:21:16.601 --> 00:21:18.601
the prices we will have
once we leave preview.

00:21:18.601 --> 00:21:20.167
Schalk: Right.
D'Alesandre: One of the things

00:21:20.167 --> 00:21:22.167
that I should mention
are reserved instances,

00:21:22.167 --> 00:21:26.000
and so, um, reserved instances--
it's actually pre-reserving

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.968
a number of instance hours
that you will use in a week.

00:21:28.968 --> 00:21:31.968
It's not reserving
the instances themselves,

00:21:31.968 --> 00:21:33.634
if that makes sense.

00:21:33.634 --> 00:21:35.968
I also wanted to highlight
datastore storage,

00:21:35.968 --> 00:21:37.968
um, which we're
actually lowering

00:21:37.968 --> 00:21:40.467
the High-Replication
datastore price

00:21:40.467 --> 00:21:42.968
from, um, from 45 cents,
where it was before,

00:21:42.968 --> 00:21:44.968
down to 24 cents today.

00:21:44.968 --> 00:21:46.968
Um, so if you log in
to your admin console,

00:21:46.968 --> 00:21:49.968
um, today, you'll see
that price has gone down,

00:21:49.968 --> 00:21:52.968
if you're using
High-Replication datastore.

00:21:52.968 --> 00:21:55.968
Um, that as well as us,

00:21:55.968 --> 00:21:57.968
um, setting it as default today

00:21:57.968 --> 00:22:00.667
just shows our commitment to it.
Schalk: Right.

00:22:00.667 --> 00:22:02.467
D'Alesandre:
All right, so, Chris...

00:22:02.467 --> 00:22:04.067
Schalk: Cool.

00:22:04.067 --> 00:22:06.067
D'Alesandre: What's going on
with App Engine for business?

00:22:06.067 --> 00:22:07.567
Schalk: So if you actually
did see the blog post,

00:22:07.567 --> 00:22:09.567
and actually went over
to the, uh, App Engine URL

00:22:09.567 --> 00:22:11.534
that we've had--
App Engine for business URL

00:22:11.534 --> 00:22:13.200
that we've had
for about a year now,

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.200
you'll see that it's kind of,
uh, disappearing.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.868
So to give you the long--
the short story, I guess,

00:22:17.868 --> 00:22:20.868
um, when we launched it,
essentially, we announce--

00:22:20.868 --> 00:22:22.868
well, I should say
when we announced

00:22:22.868 --> 00:22:25.367
that App Engine for Business
was going to be entering

00:22:25.367 --> 00:22:27.000
a preview period, uh,

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
we basically embarked on

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.033
a fairly long
trusted tester phase.

00:22:32.033 --> 00:22:35.000
And so as we started
rolling out the features,

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
I was actually in charge
of getting together

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000
a very large audience
of trusted testers out there,

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
uh, to provide feedback.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000
And probably--um, obviously,
you know, the features that we,

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000
you know, plan to put out there
are still very popular.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000
People were very interested
in the core features.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.501
But as we got into kind of,
like, getting the core feedback,

00:22:52.501 --> 00:22:54.501
we found that there were
definitely some things

00:22:54.501 --> 00:22:56.234
that we needed
to kind of address.

00:22:56.234 --> 00:22:58.634
Uh, we obviously just
found out that people--

00:22:58.634 --> 00:23:00.467
they want
the features themselves.

00:23:00.467 --> 00:23:02.868
They don't necessarily want
to kind of fit in

00:23:02.868 --> 00:23:05.133
to what we had actually
projected earlier

00:23:05.133 --> 00:23:07.434
for the overall
App Engine for Business model,

00:23:07.434 --> 00:23:09.834
meaning that it was
kind of a segmentation,

00:23:09.834 --> 00:23:11.667
or a special class
of App Engine,

00:23:11.667 --> 00:23:14.167
whereas what we're announcing
today--it's all the same.

00:23:14.167 --> 00:23:15.801
It's just App Engine.

00:23:15.801 --> 00:23:17.801
So as we launched
the trusted tester program,

00:23:17.801 --> 00:23:19.801
uh, we had our hundreds
of developers,

00:23:19.801 --> 00:23:21.801
they were, you know,
trying it out,

00:23:21.801 --> 00:23:24.467
we signed them up for early
preview to some of the programs,

00:23:24.467 --> 00:23:27.467
ran some external workshops,
had people give us feedback.

00:23:27.467 --> 00:23:30.467
And so what we were finding,
essentially, was that, um,

00:23:30.467 --> 00:23:33.334
the App Engine for Business
model

00:23:33.334 --> 00:23:35.334
was a little bit restrictive

00:23:35.334 --> 00:23:37.334
for some of our--our testers.

00:23:37.334 --> 00:23:39.367
Not all companies
were essentially focused

00:23:39.367 --> 00:23:41.334
on building internal apps,

00:23:41.334 --> 00:23:43.334
and that was what
the original thinking was

00:23:43.334 --> 00:23:45.000
with App Engine for Business.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000
And, uh, we also found that
many of our trusted testers

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.667
were not necessarily, um,

00:23:49.667 --> 00:23:51.834
we found that the per user
per app pricing

00:23:51.834 --> 00:23:54.834
was not necessarily compatible
with their usage pattern.

00:23:54.834 --> 00:23:56.501
Um, we also noticed, like,

00:23:56.501 --> 00:23:59.501
even companies that
were not officially part

00:23:59.501 --> 00:24:02.567
of our App Engine for Business
trusted tester program--

00:24:02.567 --> 00:24:04.567
they ended up kind of

00:24:04.567 --> 00:24:06.567
becoming a trusted tester

00:24:06.567 --> 00:24:09.567
by, uh, the necessity of, say,
having an SLA, for example,

00:24:09.567 --> 00:24:12.601
so we actually had
to kind of modify

00:24:12.601 --> 00:24:14.567
what we were doing to work out

00:24:14.567 --> 00:24:16.567
with some of our
key trusted testers.

00:24:16.567 --> 00:24:18.567
All in all, that provided
some great feedback.

00:24:18.567 --> 00:24:21.567
This feedback was fed right
directly back into our overall

00:24:21.567 --> 00:24:24.567
strategic, um, you know,
directions for App Engine,

00:24:24.567 --> 00:24:26.567
and here we are today,

00:24:26.567 --> 00:24:28.567
essentially announcing
what we're doing with the, uh,

00:24:28.567 --> 00:24:30.567
the leaving the preview,
and, of course,

00:24:30.567 --> 00:24:33.567
keeping the core, uh,
very popular aspects

00:24:33.567 --> 00:24:35.901
of App Engine for Business,
the SLA, support,

00:24:35.901 --> 00:24:37.901
hosted SQL,
all that kind of stuff,

00:24:37.901 --> 00:24:39.901
but just making it available
for anyone.

00:24:39.901 --> 00:24:41.334
And, of course,
anyone can do it,

00:24:41.334 --> 00:24:44.100
as long as they go ahead
and, you know, choose which--

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:46.434
what app model
they want to use for it.

00:24:46.434 --> 00:24:48.434
So what does this mean
for customers?

00:24:48.434 --> 00:24:50.434
Obviously, the timing,

00:24:50.434 --> 00:24:52.434
as Greg mentioned, as well,

00:24:52.434 --> 00:24:55.434
the timing is--
so for you guys,

00:24:55.434 --> 00:24:57.434
you don't have to worry
anything about it right now.

00:24:57.434 --> 00:24:59.334
It's gonna be down the road,

00:24:59.334 --> 00:25:01.701
sometimes the latter part
of the year.

00:25:01.701 --> 00:25:03.701
Um, we do have a new
terms of service

00:25:03.701 --> 00:25:06.200
for you guys to work through,
and, of course, the pricing

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.200
is something that
you'll have to look into

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:09.801
a little bit more closely.

00:25:09.801 --> 00:25:12.801
We are going to have a tool
that will allow you to have,

00:25:12.801 --> 00:25:14.801
essentially, on the fly
comparative bills,

00:25:14.801 --> 00:25:16.801
so you can see
what it was before,

00:25:16.801 --> 00:25:18.467
then what it's going to be.

00:25:18.467 --> 00:25:21.467
So we're basically working out
to help all existing customers

00:25:21.467 --> 00:25:23.467
to understand what, essentially,

00:25:23.467 --> 00:25:26.200
um, what it's going
to mean for them,

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.868
and mainly just
to kind of facilitate,

00:25:28.868 --> 00:25:31.868
or make sure that it's not that
big of a change for you guys.

00:25:31.868 --> 00:25:33.868
And we're definitely
counting on the fact

00:25:33.868 --> 00:25:35.868
that you guys
are going to benefit from

00:25:35.868 --> 00:25:38.367
all of the additional features
and the SLA and so forth.

00:25:38.367 --> 00:25:40.367
D'Alesandre: One of the things
I should mention is,

00:25:40.367 --> 00:25:41.968
the reason we haven't--

00:25:41.968 --> 00:25:43.968
um, we're not showing
comparative bills today

00:25:43.968 --> 00:25:45.968
is because now that
we're going to be billing

00:25:45.968 --> 00:25:48.467
based on instance hours,
um, our scheduler...

00:25:48.467 --> 00:25:49.968
Schalk: Right. Right.

00:25:49.968 --> 00:25:52.501
D'Alesandre: Which decides how
many instance you're running,

00:25:52.501 --> 00:25:54.467
is--becomes
a much more critical,

00:25:54.467 --> 00:25:56.467
um, aspect of your bill.

00:25:56.467 --> 00:25:58.467
Um, it also means that, uh,

00:25:58.467 --> 00:26:00.968
that we need to optimize
our scheduler around

00:26:00.968 --> 00:26:03.701
ensuring that your instances
are being used effectively.

00:26:03.701 --> 00:26:06.434
And so part of the reason
we're not showing you

00:26:06.434 --> 00:26:08.434
what your new bill
is going to be today

00:26:08.434 --> 00:26:10.434
is because we're still
in the process

00:26:10.434 --> 00:26:12.434
of changing our scheduler
around to make sure

00:26:12.434 --> 00:26:14.434
that we're using instances
more efficiently

00:26:14.434 --> 00:26:17.467
so that you're only paying
for what you actually need.

00:26:17.467 --> 00:26:20.467
Schalk: Yeah, and this change
also helps you be more efficient

00:26:20.467 --> 00:26:22.133
on your side, as well,
so, I mean,

00:26:22.133 --> 00:26:24.133
we're obviously fixing
the infrastructure

00:26:24.133 --> 00:26:25.834
to guide you in that way,

00:26:25.834 --> 00:26:27.801
but you can also
benefit from it, as well.

00:26:27.801 --> 00:26:30.801
All right, so at this point,
um, to kind of explain, um,

00:26:30.801 --> 00:26:33.300
some of our, you know,
key trusted testers,

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.801
and allow them
to kind of, uh, you know,

00:26:35.801 --> 00:26:37.801
describe in their own words,
you know,

00:26:37.801 --> 00:26:39.801
what the experience has been
with App Engine,

00:26:39.801 --> 00:26:41.801
and also what they
think moving forward,

00:26:41.801 --> 00:26:43.801
what this direction's gonna,
you know, have for them,

00:26:43.801 --> 00:26:45.801
we'd like to invite Dan Murray,
our co-founder

00:26:45.801 --> 00:26:47.801
and managing director
and web clients. Thank you.

00:26:47.801 --> 00:26:49.801
Murray: Thanks, Chris.
Thanks, Greg.

00:26:49.801 --> 00:26:51.801
D'Alesandre: Thanks, Dan.

00:26:51.801 --> 00:26:54.133
Murray: Well, uh,
before I dive into this

00:26:54.133 --> 00:26:56.133
and talk about GAE,

00:26:56.133 --> 00:26:58.634
and what GAE's been for us,

00:26:58.634 --> 00:27:00.701
and how excited
we are about the direction

00:27:00.701 --> 00:27:02.701
App Engine is taking

00:27:02.701 --> 00:27:05.200
over the course
of the next year here,

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.200
I want to talk a little bit
about our company

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.200
and what we do,
so you can put this in context.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:12.200
What, uh, WebFilings does,

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:15.200
we, uh, build collaborative
software that helps,

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.200
uh, financial reporting teams
and public companies

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:21.200
to streamline the process
of submitting

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:24.200
and filing their financial
reports with the SCC.

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:26.200
This is a process that, uh,

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.200
every public company
goes through.

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.200
About, uh, 10,000 companies
in the U.S. that do this,

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:32.234
and they have to do it
every quarter.

00:27:32.234 --> 00:27:34.701
It's a really challenging
process, uh,

00:27:34.701 --> 00:27:37.200
something that these companies

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.200
have struggled with for decades,

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:42.200
using, uh, more traditional

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:45.200
word processing
and spreadsheet applications--

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.200
I'll put it that way--
um, and what we've done is, uh,

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:51.200
you know, we've really looked
carefully at that space,

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.868
looked at the market,

00:27:52.868 --> 00:27:54.868
and looked at the problems
they have with collaborating,

00:27:54.868 --> 00:27:56.868
um, the problems that they have

00:27:56.868 --> 00:27:59.367
with just updating
complex documents

00:27:59.367 --> 00:28:01.434
that have a lot
of repeated information,

00:28:01.434 --> 00:28:03.934
and we built
a collaborative solution

00:28:03.934 --> 00:28:05.934
that really, um,

00:28:05.934 --> 00:28:07.934
binds the entire reporting team

00:28:07.934 --> 00:28:10.934
and other members
of the company together,

00:28:10.934 --> 00:28:12.934
and for them to collaborate

00:28:12.934 --> 00:28:14.934
and really reduce
the amount of time

00:28:14.934 --> 00:28:17.501
it takes to, uh,
produce these reports.

00:28:17.501 --> 00:28:20.501
In fact, uh, we've managed
to cut, in some cases,

00:28:20.501 --> 00:28:23.501
20 days off the time
it takes to file.

00:28:23.501 --> 00:28:26.501
Um, we have many companies
that, uh,

00:28:26.501 --> 00:28:28.501
we brought up over the past
several years--

00:28:28.501 --> 00:28:31.501
or past few years,
and just in the past year,

00:28:31.501 --> 00:28:34.000
we've gone from, I think,
zero to, uh,

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000
several hundred companies
in a very short amount of time.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.534
And App Engine--
we started on App Engine,

00:28:39.534 --> 00:28:42.000
and, uh, really, I think
we started looking at it

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.501
in, uh, right after it came out
in April 2008.

00:28:44.501 --> 00:28:46.501
Um, I remember--
we've got several

00:28:46.501 --> 00:28:48.501
WebFilings developers
here in the audience.

00:28:48.501 --> 00:28:51.501
And, uh, we--several of us
drove to Bozeman

00:28:51.501 --> 00:28:55.000
and taught ourselves Python,
and taught ourselves App Engine

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000
in the drive
on the way there.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000
And, uh, App Engine we selected
for its ability to scale,

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.067
and also, uh,

00:29:02.067 --> 00:29:04.067
with our customers,
they're very sensitive

00:29:04.067 --> 00:29:06.067
about the security
of information.

00:29:06.067 --> 00:29:09.067
And so we looked at Google,
and, uh,

00:29:09.067 --> 00:29:12.167
at how seriously Google
takes security,

00:29:12.167 --> 00:29:14.634
and the underpinnings
and security in depth

00:29:14.634 --> 00:29:16.467
that App Engine practices,

00:29:16.467 --> 00:29:19.467
and really felt that it was
the right, uh, platform for us.

00:29:19.467 --> 00:29:22.467
And again, it's helped us scale,
just over the past year,

00:29:22.467 --> 00:29:24.467
from zero to several
hundred customers,

00:29:24.467 --> 00:29:27.467
and, uh, I think we've gone
from 30 to 180 people,

00:29:27.467 --> 00:29:30.434
with, I don't know,
close to 60 developers,

00:29:30.434 --> 00:29:32.434
all developing, and, you know,

00:29:32.434 --> 00:29:34.934
deploying new apps
with a very agile method,

00:29:34.934 --> 00:29:37.434
um, you know,
every few weeks.

00:29:37.434 --> 00:29:39.934
Schalk: I hope you don't mind.
I just want to say that,

00:29:39.934 --> 00:29:42.434
when we invited you guys over
to share your technology

00:29:42.434 --> 00:29:45.434
with our overall team, uh, we
were just completely blown away

00:29:45.434 --> 00:29:48.434
by how the rich aspects
of your application.

00:29:48.434 --> 00:29:51.267
So it's a really awesome
application, and I think,

00:29:51.267 --> 00:29:53.267
you know--
hats off for you guys,

00:29:53.267 --> 00:29:55.767
and obviously, you guys
have had a great track record

00:29:55.767 --> 00:29:57.767
with your Fortune 100 companies

00:29:57.767 --> 00:29:59.767
that are now using
your technology.

00:29:59.767 --> 00:30:01.767
Murray: Yeah, yeah,
just mention real quick

00:30:01.767 --> 00:30:04.267
that we have companies like
eBay, Sprint, Valero Energy,

00:30:04.267 --> 00:30:06.267
United Airlines, and many
other Fortune 100 companies

00:30:06.267 --> 00:30:08.267
that are using our product
every single day.

00:30:08.267 --> 00:30:10.767
And like I said, we were,
you know, GAE-based,

00:30:10.767 --> 00:30:12.767
you know,
from the very beginning,

00:30:12.767 --> 00:30:15.767
and it's really simplified
our approach to development.

00:30:15.767 --> 00:30:17.767
We've been able to focus
on innovation

00:30:17.767 --> 00:30:19.467
for the market that we serve,

00:30:19.467 --> 00:30:21.934
uh, rather than on managing
the infrastructure,

00:30:21.934 --> 00:30:23.934
and it's really, you know,

00:30:23.934 --> 00:30:26.434
done great things to support
Agile development.

00:30:26.434 --> 00:30:28.934
I've been doing software
development for over 20 years,

00:30:28.934 --> 00:30:30.934
and I can tell you
I've struggled

00:30:30.934 --> 00:30:32.934
with a lot of
different platforms,

00:30:32.934 --> 00:30:34.934
and this one has, uh,
you know, I can't tell you

00:30:34.934 --> 00:30:36.934
that we haven't had our bumps
along the road,

00:30:36.934 --> 00:30:38.934
but they're minor
in comparison to, uh,

00:30:38.934 --> 00:30:41.534
anything that I had
experienced before that.

00:30:41.534 --> 00:30:44.033
Um, some of the things
that we're--

00:30:44.033 --> 00:30:46.434
we're very excited about
with App Engine,

00:30:46.434 --> 00:30:48.434
um, is--are the new features,

00:30:48.434 --> 00:30:51.434
and, you know, I really wish
that we had the Backend

00:30:51.434 --> 00:30:54.434
a few years ago
when we started, but, uh,

00:30:54.434 --> 00:30:56.434
we're gonna make very good use
of that very soon.

00:30:56.434 --> 00:30:58.434
Uh, we've had to take
different approaches

00:30:58.434 --> 00:31:01.501
to long-running processes,
so this is a really welcome,

00:31:01.501 --> 00:31:03.501
uh, welcome new feature.

00:31:03.501 --> 00:31:05.501
And then, you know,

00:31:05.501 --> 00:31:08.000
we actually, uh,
with our customers,

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000
reliability is very,
very important.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000
I mean, we've gotta be up.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000
We've gotta be up 24/7,

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000
and since we've made the switch,

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000
and Chris and, uh, Lie Hakon

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.501
and several others at, uh,
on the App Engine team,

00:31:22.501 --> 00:31:25.501
really helped us out
with the migration to HRD.

00:31:25.501 --> 00:31:27.501
And since we've made that move
to HRD,

00:31:27.501 --> 00:31:30.501
we've actually experienced,
uh, 100% uptime,

00:31:30.501 --> 00:31:33.501
and so that's been really
wonderful for our business,

00:31:33.501 --> 00:31:36.501
and, you know,
our stress level, uh, company,

00:31:36.501 --> 00:31:39.501
uh, is, you know,
nice and even as a result.

00:31:39.501 --> 00:31:42.501
Our customer support calls
don't relate to the stability,

00:31:42.501 --> 00:31:44.501
reliability
of the platform at all.

00:31:44.501 --> 00:31:46.501
They're really
more helping them solve

00:31:46.501 --> 00:31:48.501
their financial
reporting problems.

00:31:48.501 --> 00:31:50.501
And then, of course,

00:31:50.501 --> 00:31:52.501
we're excited about
the expanded support,

00:31:52.501 --> 00:31:54.501
and, uh, really,
the 3-year deprecation,

00:31:54.501 --> 00:31:57.067
and the move out
of the preview is, uh,

00:31:57.067 --> 00:31:59.100
just validation
of the choice we made,

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:02.133
and the fact that we bet
our business on App Engine,

00:32:02.133 --> 00:32:04.234
uh, three years ago,
and, uh, you know,

00:32:04.234 --> 00:32:06.234
we've taken a hard look,

00:32:06.234 --> 00:32:08.234
and worked with
Chris and Greg and crew

00:32:08.234 --> 00:32:10.234
on the, uh, pricing model.

00:32:10.234 --> 00:32:12.234
And, uh, really,
from our perspective,

00:32:12.234 --> 00:32:14.734
the cost/value benefit is there,

00:32:14.734 --> 00:32:16.734
and we don't, uh, you know,

00:32:16.734 --> 00:32:18.734
it--it fits our business model.

00:32:18.734 --> 00:32:21.734
And so we see the pricing
changes really as more,

00:32:21.734 --> 00:32:23.734
uh, validation,
and we're excited,

00:32:23.734 --> 00:32:25.734
because Google's
really getting behind us

00:32:25.734 --> 00:32:27.400
and putting a lot into, uh,

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:29.901
Google App Engine's
growth and development.

00:32:29.901 --> 00:32:32.934
Schalk: Cool. Well, thanks
very much. Uh, there you go.

00:32:32.934 --> 00:32:34.901
We heard it from Dan,
who's, uh, quite happy.

00:32:34.901 --> 00:32:36.901
[applause]

00:32:36.901 --> 00:32:38.667
Schalk: Have a seat there.

00:32:38.667 --> 00:32:41.667
So for--our next partner that
I want to bring up to the stage

00:32:41.667 --> 00:32:44.667
is, uh, Matt Fowler,
and he's actually from Jabil,

00:32:44.667 --> 00:32:47.667
and he was also one of our,
um, trusted testers

00:32:47.667 --> 00:32:50.667
who actually came on-site. We
had a workshop back in November,

00:32:50.667 --> 00:32:53.167
and he provided some really
excellent feedback

00:32:53.167 --> 00:32:55.234
that actually helped us
guide App Engine

00:32:55.234 --> 00:32:57.234
to where we are here today.

00:32:57.234 --> 00:32:59.234
So here you go.

00:32:59.234 --> 00:33:01.801
Fowler: So, uh,
my name's Matt Fowler.

00:33:01.801 --> 00:33:03.467
I'm a systems engineer with

00:33:03.467 --> 00:33:06.501
the global I.T. architecture
team at Jabil circuit.

00:33:06.501 --> 00:33:08.467
Um, just real quick, Jabil,

00:33:08.467 --> 00:33:12.000
um, we're a contract electronics
manufacturing company.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.467
Uh, we've got about
85,000 employees,

00:33:14.467 --> 00:33:17.467
and last year, we did over
$13 billion in revenue.

00:33:17.467 --> 00:33:21.000
Uh, we are also
a Google apps customer.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.467
We have about
40,000 licenses,

00:33:23.467 --> 00:33:26.467
um, and, um,

00:33:26.467 --> 00:33:29.467
you know, we started using
the App Engine platform

00:33:29.467 --> 00:33:31.968
after we began, uh,
transitioning over

00:33:31.968 --> 00:33:33.968
to, uh, Google apps,

00:33:33.968 --> 00:33:36.968
so, um, you know, it was just
kind of a natural extension

00:33:36.968 --> 00:33:38.968
of the rest of the platform.

00:33:38.968 --> 00:33:41.133
Um, you know, the, uh,

00:33:41.133 --> 00:33:43.968
we have
Java developers on staff,

00:33:43.968 --> 00:33:46.968
uh, so being able to develop

00:33:46.968 --> 00:33:49.968
in a language that we were
already familiar with

00:33:49.968 --> 00:33:51.968
was a huge plus.

00:33:51.968 --> 00:33:53.968
Um, you know, up to this point,

00:33:53.968 --> 00:33:56.968
um, you know, some of the things
that we really like

00:33:56.968 --> 00:33:59.968
about App Engine, um, it kind of
simplifies development.

00:33:59.968 --> 00:34:03.033
Um, you know, a typical
development cycle,

00:34:03.033 --> 00:34:06.033
you've got, you know, different
infrastructure to support,

00:34:06.033 --> 00:34:08.033
you know, dev--

00:34:08.033 --> 00:34:11.033
you know, dev work,
QA or testing,

00:34:11.033 --> 00:34:14.033
uh, and then, uh,
the move to production.

00:34:14.033 --> 00:34:17.033
Uh, with App Engine,
in the versioning

00:34:17.033 --> 00:34:19.534
and the way the datastore
is set up,

00:34:19.534 --> 00:34:22.534
you can actually within
one app instance,

00:34:22.534 --> 00:34:24.534
have multiple versions.

00:34:24.534 --> 00:34:26.534
You know, developers can get
their own--

00:34:26.534 --> 00:34:29.534
their own, uh, you know,
section of that app.

00:34:29.534 --> 00:34:32.534
Um, and so, uh,
it makes it simple

00:34:32.534 --> 00:34:35.734
to promote those different
versions into production.

00:34:35.734 --> 00:34:37.734
Uh, you just, you know,

00:34:37.734 --> 00:34:39.734
you can follow
the same patterns

00:34:39.734 --> 00:34:41.734
that you use today
for other tools,

00:34:41.734 --> 00:34:44.734
but, uh, it's just a little bit
easier to manage.

00:34:44.734 --> 00:34:46.734
Um, you know, the, uh,

00:34:46.734 --> 00:34:49.734
the scaling of App Engine,

00:34:49.734 --> 00:34:52.734
you know, the built-in ability
to scale up,

00:34:52.734 --> 00:34:55.734
uh, as you roll out
to more users,

00:34:55.734 --> 00:34:58.734
or, uh, you add,
you know, additional--

00:34:58.734 --> 00:35:01.801
additional functionality
that opens up, you know,

00:35:01.801 --> 00:35:03.801
additional use cases internally.

00:35:03.801 --> 00:35:05.801
Um, you know,
you don't have to--

00:35:05.801 --> 00:35:07.801
you don't have to worry
about getting additional--

00:35:07.801 --> 00:35:09.467
additional servers in place,

00:35:09.467 --> 00:35:11.467
additional network
connections in place.

00:35:11.467 --> 00:35:13.467
You, uh, you know,
as long as they have

00:35:13.467 --> 00:35:15.467
decent connection
to the internet,

00:35:15.467 --> 00:35:18.467
um, you know, you get
the scaling built in.

00:35:18.467 --> 00:35:20.467
As Chris mentioned,

00:35:20.467 --> 00:35:23.467
we, uh, we participated
in the App Engine for Business

00:35:23.467 --> 00:35:25.467
trusted tester program.

00:35:25.467 --> 00:35:28.467
I was here at I/O last year,
and, uh,

00:35:28.467 --> 00:35:30.467
after that announcement,

00:35:30.467 --> 00:35:33.467
I-I signed up
just about immediately.

00:35:33.467 --> 00:35:36.467
Um, it was something that we,

00:35:36.467 --> 00:35:39.467
you know, we definitely
wanted to look at, um,

00:35:39.467 --> 00:35:41.467
and some of the stuff added

00:35:41.467 --> 00:35:43.467
by the business offering, uh,

00:35:43.467 --> 00:35:46.467
really enabled us to be able
to get into it.

00:35:46.467 --> 00:35:49.467
Um, you know, over the course
of the participation

00:35:49.467 --> 00:35:52.467
in the, uh,
in the trusted tester program,

00:35:52.467 --> 00:35:54.467
we, uh, you know,

00:35:54.467 --> 00:35:57.467
we looked at the original
pricing model,

00:35:57.467 --> 00:35:59.467
which was, uh,

00:35:59.467 --> 00:36:02.033
you know, per user,
per month,

00:36:02.033 --> 00:36:04.534
which, for us, didn't really
work that well.

00:36:04.534 --> 00:36:07.033
Um, you know,
we really wanted the, uh,

00:36:07.033 --> 00:36:09.033
the utilization and, uh,

00:36:09.033 --> 00:36:12.501
you know, tracking cost
by utilization, and, uh--

00:36:12.501 --> 00:36:14.033
Schalk: I remember
you had mentioned

00:36:14.033 --> 00:36:16.033
you had, like, thousands
of people on the shop floor,

00:36:16.033 --> 00:36:18.033
right, and so it just wouldn't
work out for you guys

00:36:18.033 --> 00:36:19.701
in that sense, right?

00:36:19.701 --> 00:36:21.701
Murray: Right, right.
Um, so, uh, you know,

00:36:21.701 --> 00:36:23.701
the team took that
into account, uh,

00:36:23.701 --> 00:36:25.367
with the new pricing model.

00:36:25.367 --> 00:36:27.367
Um, you know, also the, uh,

00:36:27.367 --> 00:36:29.367
during the trusted tester,

00:36:29.367 --> 00:36:32.367
uh, phase
for the business product,

00:36:32.367 --> 00:36:34.868
um, authentication was locked

00:36:34.868 --> 00:36:37.367
to a single Google apps domain,

00:36:37.367 --> 00:36:39.801
and, um, you know, we, uh--

00:36:39.801 --> 00:36:42.801
we needed the ability
to have other domains

00:36:42.801 --> 00:36:44.801
access the applications
we had developed,

00:36:44.801 --> 00:36:46.801
so that was another item...

00:36:46.801 --> 00:36:48.801
Schalk: Right, right.
Murray: That, uh, we fed back.

00:36:48.801 --> 00:36:53.067
Um, so with, uh,
today's announcements,

00:36:53.067 --> 00:36:55.000
um, you know, we, uh,

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.534
we've got a lot of new stuff
to look at.

00:36:57.534 --> 00:36:59.701
Uh, we're pretty excited
about new functionality

00:36:59.701 --> 00:37:01.200
in the platform.

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:04.734
Um, we have some development
groups that, you know,

00:37:04.734 --> 00:37:08.033
are looking at the--
at using this to, uh,

00:37:08.033 --> 00:37:11.033
kind of augment what--
what they've already done,

00:37:11.033 --> 00:37:13.033
and definitely, uh,
some of the changes here

00:37:13.033 --> 00:37:15.033
are gonna enable them
to move into that.

00:37:15.033 --> 00:37:18.033
Um, taking the preview
label off, uh,

00:37:18.033 --> 00:37:20.534
kind of adds a level
of comfort to people

00:37:20.534 --> 00:37:22.534
who are, you know,
just now getting ready

00:37:22.534 --> 00:37:25.534
to, uh, to start getting
familiar with the platform.

00:37:25.534 --> 00:37:27.534
Even internally,
we have groups that,

00:37:27.534 --> 00:37:29.434
you know,
haven't looked at it yet,

00:37:29.434 --> 00:37:31.934
um, and they were
kind of hesitant to.

00:37:31.934 --> 00:37:33.968
Because it was
considered preview,

00:37:33.968 --> 00:37:35.934
they weren't sure
if it was gonna be here,

00:37:35.934 --> 00:37:38.934
but, uh, definitely, yeah,
with today's announcement,

00:37:38.934 --> 00:37:40.934
you know,
the commitment's there.

00:37:40.934 --> 00:37:43.434
Um, you know,
operational support in SLA,

00:37:43.434 --> 00:37:45.434
that's very important for us.

00:37:45.434 --> 00:37:47.934
Um, you know,
our internal support

00:37:47.934 --> 00:37:49.934
is, you know, 24/7.

00:37:49.934 --> 00:37:52.434
You know, we have follow-the-sun
support internally,

00:37:52.434 --> 00:37:55.434
and being able to have, uh,

00:37:55.434 --> 00:37:58.434
the ability to push back
and escalate issues,

00:37:58.434 --> 00:38:00.934
uh, you know, through
operational support

00:38:00.934 --> 00:38:03.400
is definitely something
that we would want

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:05.000
for this, as well.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000
Um, the hosted SQL--

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000
um, that's important
for us, as well.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000
Most of our applications
internally, um,

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000
use relational databases, um,

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000
and adding relational,
uh, database support

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000
to the App Engine platform

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000
would, uh, allow our users
to, uh--

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000
or, our developers to more
easily transition those apps,

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.000
um, over to, uh,
the App Engine platform.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.000
Um, you know,
a lot of our developers

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000
are more experienced with
relational databases, um,

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000
and moving to
a non-relational model,

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000
you know, you kind of
have to redo some code,

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.601
and, you know,
re-architect some apps.

00:38:43.601 --> 00:38:46.100
Um, the new cost model,

00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:49.100
you know, it definitely
allows us to better forecast

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:51.100
the cost based on utilization.

00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:54.100
Um, you know,
and as we look to scale up,

00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:57.100
you know, we can kind of do
those calculations internally

00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:00.100
before we do it, and, uh, plan
on what we're gonna be, uh,

00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:02.167
what we're gonna be spending.

00:39:02.167 --> 00:39:04.667
And, uh, the centralized billing
and invoicing--

00:39:04.667 --> 00:39:06.834
that's definitely something
we were looking for.

00:39:06.834 --> 00:39:09.834
Um, you know, now we can,
uh, get all the costs,

00:39:09.834 --> 00:39:11.834
you know, invoiced to us,

00:39:11.834 --> 00:39:14.334
rather than having
credit cards on file.

00:39:14.334 --> 00:39:15.834
So, uh...

00:39:15.834 --> 00:39:17.834
Schalk: Cool, yeah, I'd like
to--you know, obviously,

00:39:17.834 --> 00:39:19.834
when we had our discussions,
and as we were,

00:39:19.834 --> 00:39:22.834
you know, briefing you on
essentially the new direction,

00:39:22.834 --> 00:39:24.834
it was such a relief to see also
that you guys

00:39:24.834 --> 00:39:27.767
were really jumping on board,
as well as Dan,

00:39:27.767 --> 00:39:29.767
and, uh, had
a very positive, um,

00:39:29.767 --> 00:39:31.767
feedback with the rest
of the direction.

00:39:31.767 --> 00:39:33.267
Um, so we're gonna--

00:39:33.267 --> 00:39:35.767
I'm gonna go ahead
and summarize really quickly,

00:39:35.767 --> 00:39:38.267
and then we're gonna switch
over into, like, a Q&amp;A mode.

00:39:38.267 --> 00:39:40.767
So, um, you might want to grab
that mic, just in case.

00:39:40.767 --> 00:39:42.767
Um, but all in short,
just to summarize,

00:39:42.767 --> 00:39:45.267
Greg and I are both,
you know, super excited,

00:39:45.267 --> 00:39:48.267
the entire App Engine team,
which--see 'em right here--

00:39:48.267 --> 00:39:51.267
uh, are very excited, as well,
to leave preview.

00:39:51.267 --> 00:39:54.267
Um, you know, and I think,
probably the biggest thing,

00:39:54.267 --> 00:39:56.267
is that, you know,
not just the--a focused

00:39:56.267 --> 00:39:58.767
or core set of people,
but really anyone

00:39:58.767 --> 00:40:01.267
can take advantage
of the upcoming features,

00:40:01.267 --> 00:40:02.934
and, you know,
it's not, you know,

00:40:02.934 --> 00:40:04.601
just this one particular
class of people.

00:40:04.601 --> 00:40:06.601
And I think probably
the biggest thing is,

00:40:06.601 --> 00:40:08.267
obviously, App Engine
is locked in,

00:40:08.267 --> 00:40:10.400
it's here to stay,
you can definitely bank on it.

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:14.267
Enterprise companies can really
put that down as, you know,

00:40:14.267 --> 00:40:17.267
a major cause for why, you know,
they can go ahead and move ahead

00:40:17.267 --> 00:40:19.267
with App Engine
in enterprise scenarios.

00:40:19.267 --> 00:40:21.767
So anyway, let's go ahead
and switch over into our--

00:40:21.767 --> 00:40:24.267
obviously, there's
our information, as well,

00:40:24.267 --> 00:40:26.267
that you want to keep handy,

00:40:26.267 --> 00:40:28.267
but let's go ahead
and switch into Q&amp;A mode.

00:40:28.267 --> 00:40:30.267
And it looks like
we have two microphones--

00:40:30.267 --> 00:40:32.267
we have one over there,
and it looks like we have

00:40:32.267 --> 00:40:33.901
a few questions queuing up,

00:40:33.901 --> 00:40:35.901
and then this one
over here is still open.

00:40:35.901 --> 00:40:37.400
So I'll go ahead
and act as emcee,

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:39.400
uh, so feel free to jump in
and ask questions now.

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.267
man: What is the best practice
that you recommend

00:40:41.267 --> 00:40:43.567
for backing up your data
from your applications

00:40:43.567 --> 00:40:47.434
and data that's stored
in the datastore on App Engine?

00:40:47.434 --> 00:40:50.167
Schalk: So for backing up
in general, or...

00:40:50.167 --> 00:40:52.501
man: Backup, yeah. Backups.
Schalk: Yeah--

00:40:52.501 --> 00:40:54.501
D'Alesandre: You want to--

00:40:54.501 --> 00:40:56.501
Schalk: Eh, the best practice--
I don't know what--

00:40:56.501 --> 00:40:58.501
would you guys
have any particular one

00:40:58.501 --> 00:41:00.501
that you would say that--
just, you know...

00:41:00.501 --> 00:41:03.000
man: [speaking indistinctly]
Schalk: Yeah.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.934
man: Map Reduce library
is getting really good.

00:41:05.934 --> 00:41:07.934
Schalk: Yeah,
so Map Reduce library,

00:41:07.934 --> 00:41:09.934
in case you can't hear him.
man: [speaking indistinctly]

00:41:09.934 --> 00:41:11.801
Schalk: Yeah, Map Reduce
to blobstore,

00:41:11.801 --> 00:41:13.300
I guess, is what we're using.

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:15.300
D'Alesandre: Um,
one of the things, uh,

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:17.300
just as an aside
on that question--

00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:19.300
we've heard loud and clear

00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:21.300
that backup and restore

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:24.300
is a very much-needed feature
of App Engine,

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:26.334
and so we've heard that,
and it's--

00:41:26.334 --> 00:41:29.300
we've added it to our list
of things to do.

00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:31.300
Schalk: Mm-hmm.

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:34.300
Yes--oh, let's go
on the left side--yes?

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:37.300
man: I have, uh,
two security questions.

00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:40.300
Remember back, um,
in Google Apps for Business,

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:43.434
uh, you had a secure VPN

00:41:43.434 --> 00:41:46.801
back into the enterprise
for local data.

00:41:46.801 --> 00:41:49.801
I was wondering if that's still
a part of the new release.

00:41:49.801 --> 00:41:51.801
D'Alesandre: Um, absolutely.

00:41:51.801 --> 00:41:54.801
So that is indeed
still available.

00:41:54.801 --> 00:41:57.801
Um, there are, uh,
we're in the process

00:41:57.801 --> 00:41:59.801
of working on,
potentially, other ways

00:41:59.801 --> 00:42:02.367
to connect
back to your on premise.

00:42:02.367 --> 00:42:04.367
Um, but secure data connector,

00:42:04.367 --> 00:42:06.868
which is specifically the thing
you're referring to,

00:42:06.868 --> 00:42:08.868
is indeed still available,

00:42:08.868 --> 00:42:11.868
and available for, uh,
for PIG users to use.

00:42:11.868 --> 00:42:13.868
man: Okay. My next question

00:42:13.868 --> 00:42:16.868
is, uh, for
Google Apps for Government,

00:42:16.868 --> 00:42:18.868
or federal government users--

00:42:18.868 --> 00:42:21.868
um, does the new release,

00:42:21.868 --> 00:42:24.868
um, take advantage of any

00:42:24.868 --> 00:42:26.868
of the sort of security--

00:42:26.868 --> 00:42:28.868
higher security standards

00:42:28.868 --> 00:42:30.868
required from FISMA,

00:42:30.868 --> 00:42:33.901
and the additional, um,

00:42:33.901 --> 00:42:36.868
CODIS requirements
for keeping your data

00:42:36.868 --> 00:42:39.868
within the datacenters
in the United States,

00:42:39.868 --> 00:42:41.868
or does, uh, um,

00:42:41.868 --> 00:42:44.868
Google Apps have--

00:42:44.868 --> 00:42:46.868
or, App Engine,

00:42:46.868 --> 00:42:49.868
um, have those, uh,

00:42:49.868 --> 00:42:52.367
boundaries for
federal commissioners?

00:42:52.367 --> 00:42:55.367
D'Alesandre: Um,
so we don't currently have--

00:42:55.367 --> 00:42:58.400
or--I'm sorry--
we're not currently announcing

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:01.467
additional, um, certification.
I believe--

00:43:01.467 --> 00:43:03.467
Schalk: We're on track for--

00:43:03.467 --> 00:43:05.467
like, some of the stuff
is in progress, like, now,

00:43:05.467 --> 00:43:07.467
like, SAS70, for example.

00:43:07.467 --> 00:43:09.968
D'Alesandre: Right, exactly--
SAS70's in progress,

00:43:09.968 --> 00:43:12.300
and I believe it's FISMA
level 1 is in progress--

00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:14.801
I'm trying to get
a head nod from...

00:43:14.801 --> 00:43:17.300
All right, FISMA level 1
is in progress.

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:19.300
That was a good enough nod.

00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:22.300
Um, so we're not--
we're not announcing

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:24.300
any additional, uh,

00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:26.300
um, additional, um,

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:29.234
compliance with this launch.

00:43:29.234 --> 00:43:31.234
It is one of the things
that we know, again,

00:43:31.234 --> 00:43:33.234
is very necessary
for government customers,

00:43:33.234 --> 00:43:35.234
and enterprises in general,

00:43:35.234 --> 00:43:37.234
and so we are working
on better compliance.

00:43:37.234 --> 00:43:39.234
Schalk: One thing that we
actually have been doing,

00:43:39.234 --> 00:43:41.734
and Dan can chime in--
is, uh, even though, we're--

00:43:41.734 --> 00:43:44.734
for example, the option core
product is on track for SAS70,

00:43:44.734 --> 00:43:46.734
type 2 certification,
I believe.

00:43:46.734 --> 00:43:49.734
Uh, we also go through
and have helped some specific,

00:43:49.734 --> 00:43:52.734
you know, enterprise customers
with their security audits,

00:43:52.734 --> 00:43:55.734
and so, for example, Dan,
we've had numerous, like--

00:43:55.734 --> 00:43:58.734
uh, we would provide you
white papers/

00:43:58.734 --> 00:44:00.734
We would provide you
essentially access to

00:44:00.734 --> 00:44:03.801
a lot of our security staff to
go over some of these things,

00:44:03.801 --> 00:44:05.801
if you want to--
Murray: I mean, we've had to--

00:44:05.801 --> 00:44:07.467
Is this on?
Schalk: Yeah, you're good.

00:44:07.467 --> 00:44:09.467
Murray: We've had to complete,
uh, you know,

00:44:09.467 --> 00:44:11.000
BITS SIG questionnaires,
and, uh,

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.834
work with I.T. security teams

00:44:13.834 --> 00:44:16.300
from some of the largest
companies in the world,

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:18.300
and, you know, Google's
been very supportive of that

00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:20.300
by providing, as Chris said,
the material,

00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:22.300
and being able
to answer questions,

00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:24.300
but at the same time,
uh, you know,

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:26.801
we take an approach of,
you know, making sure that,

00:44:26.801 --> 00:44:29.801
you know, we have appropriate

00:44:29.801 --> 00:44:32.801
security processes
and standards,

00:44:32.801 --> 00:44:35.801
and, uh, really black-box
what Google does,

00:44:35.801 --> 00:44:38.300
so that the boundaries
are well-defined,

00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:40.300
and that's really key
to, I think successful--

00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:42.300
success with security audits.

00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:44.501
Schalk: Mm-hmm. Thanks.

00:44:44.501 --> 00:44:46.133
Good. Question over here.

00:44:46.133 --> 00:44:48.634
man: With regards
to the new pricing model,

00:44:48.634 --> 00:44:51.634
what exactly qualifies
as a datastore operation,

00:44:51.634 --> 00:44:54.133
or, put differently,
what exactly do I get

00:44:54.133 --> 00:44:56.934
for my 1/10,000 of a cent?
D'Alesandre: [chuckles]

00:44:56.934 --> 00:44:59.133
Um, that is
a really good question,

00:44:59.133 --> 00:45:01.200
and it's one of the details,

00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:04.200
uh, that we're still, um,

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:06.200
working through
the precise definition

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:07.868
of what that operation is,

00:45:07.868 --> 00:45:10.868
so that's one of the things that
we'll be talking more about

00:45:10.868 --> 00:45:12.868
in the coming weeks.

00:45:12.868 --> 00:45:14.868
Schalk: Question on this side?

00:45:14.868 --> 00:45:16.868
man: Thanks. I'm curious,
for the two companies--

00:45:16.868 --> 00:45:19.868
have you built the model
for the new pricing structure,

00:45:19.868 --> 00:45:22.868
and are you willing to share
whether that model,

00:45:22.868 --> 00:45:25.367
based on existing use
of your apps--

00:45:25.367 --> 00:45:27.367
does that say that
you are gonna stay

00:45:27.367 --> 00:45:29.367
at your current cost
for infrastructure,

00:45:29.367 --> 00:45:31.367
or is it going up
or going down?

00:45:31.367 --> 00:45:33.367
Murray: You want to start?
Fowler: Sure.

00:45:33.367 --> 00:45:36.367
Uh, so, uh,
we have a spreadsheet

00:45:36.367 --> 00:45:38.367
that we put together,
uh, internally,

00:45:38.367 --> 00:45:40.868
um, that, you know,
we could punch in

00:45:40.868 --> 00:45:42.868
some of the statistics
for, you know,

00:45:42.868 --> 00:45:45.868
the past, you know, couple
months of utilization for, uh,

00:45:45.868 --> 00:45:48.868
well, this was for one
specific app that we had--

00:45:48.868 --> 00:45:50.868
um, and, you know,

00:45:50.868 --> 00:45:53.901
we've tweaked it
to account for the change,

00:45:53.901 --> 00:45:56.868
you know,
from a per CPU utilization

00:45:56.868 --> 00:45:58.868
to, you know, per--

00:45:58.868 --> 00:46:00.868
per instance hour, really,

00:46:00.868 --> 00:46:02.934
or per instance, you know,
that's online.

00:46:02.934 --> 00:46:04.934
Um, but, uh, you know,

00:46:04.934 --> 00:46:07.934
for some of our apps,
you know,

00:46:07.934 --> 00:46:09.934
compared to the original
pricing model

00:46:09.934 --> 00:46:11.934
for the App Engine for Business,

00:46:11.934 --> 00:46:13.934
these costs would be lower,

00:46:13.934 --> 00:46:15.934
but, uh, you know,

00:46:15.934 --> 00:46:18.934
the, uh, the cost for, um,

00:46:18.934 --> 00:46:21.434
we have a couple apps
that take advantage

00:46:21.434 --> 00:46:23.434
of some of these more
specialized APIs,

00:46:23.434 --> 00:46:25.934
um, that the billing
is being changed on--

00:46:25.934 --> 00:46:28.667
um, for example,
the, uh, the XMPP--

00:46:28.667 --> 00:46:31.667
um, those may change,
but overall, the--

00:46:31.667 --> 00:46:34.167
there's not that much
of a difference for us.

00:46:34.167 --> 00:46:37.934
Murray: Yeah, we have
a spreadsheet that we run, too,

00:46:37.934 --> 00:46:40.167
and, uh, looked at this
pretty closely.

00:46:40.167 --> 00:46:43.167
You know, really, uh,
for our application,

00:46:43.167 --> 00:46:46.167
compared to what we would pay
through other providers,

00:46:46.167 --> 00:46:48.667
I mean, we're--you know,
it's considerably less.

00:46:48.667 --> 00:46:50.667
Uh, price gonna go up?

00:46:50.667 --> 00:46:53.167
Yeah, it's gonna cost us
more money to do it,

00:46:53.167 --> 00:46:55.167
but compared
to the value we get,

00:46:55.167 --> 00:46:57.167
it's really not significant.

00:46:57.167 --> 00:46:59.167
D'Alesandre: And I know
the question

00:46:59.167 --> 00:47:01.734
wasn't directed at me, but, uh,
I think, you know,

00:47:01.734 --> 00:47:04.234
to be straightforward and clear,

00:47:04.234 --> 00:47:06.234
um, it likely will be

00:47:06.234 --> 00:47:08.234
more expensive
for most customers.

00:47:08.234 --> 00:47:10.734
Um, we're not--we're not
doing this as a way to--

00:47:10.734 --> 00:47:12.734
to make App Engine cheaper.

00:47:12.734 --> 00:47:15.734
We're making it--
we're doing the pricing change

00:47:15.734 --> 00:47:18.734
as a way to make pricing
both more transparent,

00:47:18.734 --> 00:47:21.234
but also to price it
for the value of the offering

00:47:21.234 --> 00:47:23.234
that our customers are getting,

00:47:23.234 --> 00:47:26.234
so most customers will see
some increase in price.

00:47:26.234 --> 00:47:28.734
Schalk: It essentially allows us
to lock it in long-term,

00:47:28.734 --> 00:47:30.734
so it's a sustainable
pricing model.

00:47:30.734 --> 00:47:32.400
man: No, that's fair.

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:34.400
So that's the first time
I'd actually seen that matrix,

00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:36.734
and talking about XMP
brings up another question--

00:47:36.734 --> 00:47:38.734
Sorry, just one more thing--
was that a typo,

00:47:38.734 --> 00:47:40.734
or did the number
of e-mails per day--

00:47:40.734 --> 00:47:43.734
does that really go
from 2,000 down to 100?

00:47:43.734 --> 00:47:46.234
D'Alesandre: Uh, yes,
so the number of e-mails per day

00:47:46.234 --> 00:47:49.234
has actually changed, um,
from 2,000 down to 100,

00:47:49.234 --> 00:47:52.234
and that effect is
taking place immediately.

00:47:52.234 --> 00:47:54.234
Um, we're doing that, uh,

00:47:54.234 --> 00:47:57.234
to ensure everyone is using
the API appropriately.

00:47:57.234 --> 00:48:00.234
man: Is there a white listing
program, though, that you--

00:48:00.234 --> 00:48:01.801
man: Free e-mail.

00:48:01.801 --> 00:48:03.801
D'Alesandre: Oh, sorry,
free e-mails.

00:48:03.801 --> 00:48:05.567
Yeah, this is for free e-mails.
man: Okay.

00:48:05.567 --> 00:48:07.601
D'Alesandre: You can still--
you can still pay for more,

00:48:07.601 --> 00:48:09.567
but, right,
the number of free ones.

00:48:09.567 --> 00:48:12.067
As you can imagine,
a lot of people saw 2,000

00:48:12.067 --> 00:48:14.400
free e-mails per app, per day,

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:17.868
as a way to take advantage
of the program.

00:48:17.868 --> 00:48:20.367
man: Right. So basically, it
punishes the good guys, right?

00:48:20.367 --> 00:48:23.367
It doesn't fix the problem.

00:48:23.367 --> 00:48:25.367
D'Alesandre: Um,
we can talk afterwards.

00:48:25.367 --> 00:48:27.367
man: All right.
Schalk: [laughs]

00:48:27.367 --> 00:48:29.033
man: Thank you.
Schalk: Question on the right.

00:48:29.033 --> 00:48:31.033
man: Yeah, thanks,
I've got two questions.

00:48:31.033 --> 00:48:33.534
One is on deprecation.
Is depre--is the three years

00:48:33.534 --> 00:48:35.534
at the all-out App Engine level,

00:48:35.534 --> 00:48:37.534
technology level,
or API level?

00:48:37.534 --> 00:48:40.567
D'Alesandre: Okay,
so the deprecation is, um,

00:48:40.567 --> 00:48:42.534
it can be at
any of those levels,

00:48:42.534 --> 00:48:45.000
so if there's a specific API
that we're deprecating

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.501
and saying that we are
no longer developing on,

00:48:47.501 --> 00:48:50.501
we'll be very explicit that,
this is now being deprecated,

00:48:50.501 --> 00:48:53.000
we're no longer going
to continue development,

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.000
and then that's when the clock
starts for the three years.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.000
Um, it is possible,

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.467
let's say, in some
future crazy world,

00:49:00.467 --> 00:49:02.534
that App Engine, um--

00:49:02.534 --> 00:49:04.868
that Google stops development
of App Engine,

00:49:04.868 --> 00:49:06.868
then App Engine itself will--

00:49:06.868 --> 00:49:09.501
will be under that
deprecation policy, as well.

00:49:09.501 --> 00:49:11.501
So it--it's at all levels
of the stack,

00:49:11.501 --> 00:49:14.868
but essentially we'll explicitly
say, "X" is being deprecated,

00:49:14.868 --> 00:49:16.868
and that starts
the 3-year clock.

00:49:16.868 --> 00:49:18.868
man: Okay, that was
my big question...

00:49:18.868 --> 00:49:20.868
[speaking indistinctly]

00:49:20.868 --> 00:49:22.534
...it might break my app,

00:49:22.534 --> 00:49:24.534
and how long do I have
to actually fix that?

00:49:24.534 --> 00:49:26.534
D'Alesandre: Um...
You said something three years.

00:49:26.534 --> 00:49:28.534
D'Alesandre: Uh, so, yes--

00:49:28.534 --> 00:49:30.934
well, that's for depre--
that's for deprecated,

00:49:30.934 --> 00:49:32.534
um, full APIs.

00:49:32.534 --> 00:49:35.367
In terms of versions,
we're going to be, uh,

00:49:35.367 --> 00:49:38.367
there's a deprecation policy
for major versions.

00:49:38.367 --> 00:49:40.367
Um, so it's--

00:49:40.367 --> 00:49:42.367
it's hard to tell exactly,

00:49:42.367 --> 00:49:44.367
um, from your question,

00:49:44.367 --> 00:49:47.400
if, like, there's a specific
area you're worried about,

00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:49.367
but it's gonna be
major versions,

00:49:49.367 --> 00:49:51.367
the whole product, and whole
APIs that are being under--

00:49:51.367 --> 00:49:53.367
man: But I think, like,
a specific issue is,

00:49:53.367 --> 00:49:55.367
I've got an app that's
running on version 1.0.

00:49:55.367 --> 00:49:56.868
D'Alesandre: Mm-hmm.

00:49:56.868 --> 00:49:59.734
man: Version 2.0 comes out,
and the API actually changes,

00:49:59.734 --> 00:50:01.601
which means, the question is,

00:50:01.601 --> 00:50:03.434
Does that automatically
shift forward,

00:50:03.434 --> 00:50:05.067
and if it does,
then it breaks my app,

00:50:05.067 --> 00:50:06.567
so how much time do you give me

00:50:06.567 --> 00:50:08.067
before I have to make
that change?

00:50:08.067 --> 00:50:10.067
D'Alesandre: Um, so, uh, if--

00:50:10.067 --> 00:50:12.934
if we're adding, um,
if we're adding a new API,

00:50:12.934 --> 00:50:15.400
that doesn't sort of start
the clock for deprecation,

00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:17.400
as long as the old
one's supported,

00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:20.434
and I believe
we're still supporting

00:50:20.434 --> 00:50:22.400
old APIs--
man: I understand.

00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:24.400
D'Alesandre: Yeah,
I was gonna say...

00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:27.000
man: [speaking indistinctly]
D'Alesandre: Right.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.334
man: Occasionally, you'll see
that we wrote something,

00:50:29.334 --> 00:50:32.501
we say, "Oops," and we fix it
as quickly as we possibly can,

00:50:32.501 --> 00:50:34.000
so if we're gonna introduce

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000
anew version of
the datastore API, for example,

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000
we're not gonna
just remove the old one.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.801
We would say, "This one's
deprecated, here's the new one,"

00:50:40.801 --> 00:50:42.801
and that deprecated one
would be around

00:50:42.801 --> 00:50:44.467
and serviced for three years.
D'Alesandre: Right.

00:50:44.467 --> 00:50:46.467
man: So the other question
I have is, um--

00:50:46.467 --> 00:50:48.968
Schalk: Did you guys get that
in the back of the audience?

00:50:48.968 --> 00:50:50.300
man: No.
Schalk: Okay. Here you want to--

00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:52.801
D'Alesandre: Just--
I can repeat what Max said.

00:50:52.801 --> 00:50:54.834
Um, what Max said
was, essentially,

00:50:54.834 --> 00:50:57.300
the way our APIs work
is we don't make

00:50:57.300 --> 00:50:59.968
backwards incompatible
changes, um,

00:50:59.968 --> 00:51:02.701
and so if we did make a
backwards incompatible change,

00:51:02.701 --> 00:51:05.701
that would fall under
the 3-year deprecation cycle,

00:51:05.701 --> 00:51:08.701
but currently, we don't
and haven't been making those.

00:51:08.701 --> 00:51:11.200
man: The other question I had
was, a lot of enterprises

00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:13.534
are .NET and Java...
[speaking indistinctly]

00:51:13.534 --> 00:51:15.701
so .NET or...
[speaking indistinctly]

00:51:15.701 --> 00:51:17.868
Any thoughts on whether
you guys would support that?

00:51:17.868 --> 00:51:19.868
I was really surprised
you supported Go versus

00:51:19.868 --> 00:51:22.100
something that was more
mainstream for the enterprise.

00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:25.100
D'Alesandre: Um, so frankly,
we're looking at a number

00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:28.133
of different runtimes
to be able to support.

00:51:28.133 --> 00:51:31.100
Um, we don't have any additional
ones that we can talk about

00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:32.767
or announce today.

00:51:32.767 --> 00:51:35.267
Um, Go is the one that it was
ready for us to talk about

00:51:35.267 --> 00:51:37.267
and announce today.
man: Got you. Okay, thank you.

00:51:37.267 --> 00:51:39.267
D'Alesandre: Mm-hmm.
Schalk: Yeah, question?

00:51:39.267 --> 00:51:41.934
man: So at last year's I/O,

00:51:41.934 --> 00:51:45.434
the big App Engine for Business
bombshell

00:51:45.434 --> 00:51:46.934
was SQL,

00:51:46.934 --> 00:51:48.934
relational databases
for App Engine.

00:51:48.934 --> 00:51:51.934
I didn't hear very much
about that today.

00:51:51.934 --> 00:51:53.934
I didn't see any pricing for it.

00:51:53.934 --> 00:51:55.934
So from Google,
I would like to hear,

00:51:55.934 --> 00:51:57.934
where are we with hosted SQL?

00:51:57.934 --> 00:52:01.000
And from Jabil, uh,
I'd like to learn

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000
a little bit more about, uh,

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000
your experience with it,

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:08.000
uh, response time,
uh, reliability,

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.000
how it compares to
an on-site SQL database.

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.501
Schalk: Yeah, so I was
just gonna say that, uh,

00:52:13.501 --> 00:52:15.501
yeah, we're still
in trusted tester mode.

00:52:15.501 --> 00:52:17.501
We have, like, a number
of people out there

00:52:17.501 --> 00:52:19.167
that are trying it out--

00:52:19.167 --> 00:52:22.167
I don't believe we've actually
locked down specific pricing.

00:52:22.167 --> 00:52:24.167
D'Alesandre: So remember
how I mentioned earlier

00:52:24.167 --> 00:52:26.167
that SSL is one of
our top priorities?

00:52:26.167 --> 00:52:29.167
As you might imagine, SQL is one
of our other top priorities.

00:52:29.167 --> 00:52:31.167
Um, we are working hard on it.

00:52:31.167 --> 00:52:34.200
We don't have a specific release
date that we can state yet.

00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:36.167
Um, but we're absolutely
working on it,

00:52:36.167 --> 00:52:38.934
and as Chris mentioned, we have
trusted testers today.

00:52:38.934 --> 00:52:41.334
Schalk: Yeah, and anyone is--
you know, just let me know,

00:52:41.334 --> 00:52:43.667
or you can, like--
there's an online form

00:52:43.667 --> 00:52:46.667
you can request access,
and then essentially be set up,

00:52:46.667 --> 00:52:49.667
and then you can turn on your
instance and start using it.

00:52:49.667 --> 00:52:52.667
Also just--
it is MySQL compatible,

00:52:52.667 --> 00:52:54.667
so it's essentially
the, uh, flavor of SQL,

00:52:54.667 --> 00:52:57.167
essentially MySQL, um,
but, yeah, that's basically it,

00:52:57.167 --> 00:52:58.834
so if you want to try it out,

00:52:58.834 --> 00:53:00.667
definitely welcome
to try it out.

00:53:00.667 --> 00:53:03.234
Did you have anything further
to add on the SQL part?

00:53:03.234 --> 00:53:06.234
Fowler: Uh, yeah, so with
regard to the difference

00:53:06.234 --> 00:53:08.267
between the hosted SQL
and on-premise,

00:53:08.267 --> 00:53:11.234
uh, with the tools that have
been made available so far

00:53:11.234 --> 00:53:13.234
under the trusted tester
program,

00:53:13.234 --> 00:53:16.234
they, uh, they make it
very easy to work with.

00:53:16.234 --> 00:53:18.234
You know, you have--

00:53:18.234 --> 00:53:21.234
Schalk: I mean, it's basically,
like, embedded into the SDK.

00:53:21.234 --> 00:53:23.234
Fowler: That's what
I'm talking about here.

00:53:23.234 --> 00:53:26.434
So, uh, yeah, so, you know,
there's command line access

00:53:26.434 --> 00:53:28.234
to the SQL environment.
Schalk: Right.

00:53:28.234 --> 00:53:30.000
Fowler: And it is
MySQL compatible,

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.067
and so it's--it's very easy
to work with.

00:53:32.067 --> 00:53:34.734
man: And your experience
with its reliability

00:53:34.734 --> 00:53:36.901
and, per Dan, response time?

00:53:36.901 --> 00:53:38.901
Fowler: Uh, yeah, so far, uh,

00:53:38.901 --> 00:53:41.901
we haven't encountered,
you know, any major issues,

00:53:41.901 --> 00:53:44.067
but, you know, it is still
in development, so, you know...

00:53:44.067 --> 00:53:45.734
D'Alesandre: Yeah,
and we'd encourage you

00:53:45.734 --> 00:53:47.734
to join the trusted tester
program if you want to join.

00:53:47.734 --> 00:53:49.734
Schalk: Definitely looking
for a good feedback,

00:53:49.734 --> 00:53:51.734
or feedback in general.
man: Thanks.

00:53:51.734 --> 00:53:53.434
Schalk: Question on the right?

00:53:53.434 --> 00:53:55.434
man: So my question has to do
with the algorithm

00:53:55.434 --> 00:53:58.400
for determining what priority

00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:01.467
to give a particular app
in App Engine,

00:54:01.467 --> 00:54:04.133
and the reason
I'm interested in that

00:54:04.133 --> 00:54:06.133
is because the app
that I'm currently running

00:54:06.133 --> 00:54:08.133
that I'm considering
moving to App Engine

00:54:08.133 --> 00:54:10.133
is something that's event-based,

00:54:10.133 --> 00:54:12.133
meaning there's
very little traffic

00:54:12.133 --> 00:54:14.801
for a long period of time,
until June 18th shows up,

00:54:14.801 --> 00:54:16.767
or whatever that
event deadline is,

00:54:16.767 --> 00:54:18.767
and all of a sudden,
it just spikes.

00:54:18.767 --> 00:54:20.767
And will
the App Engine algorithm--

00:54:20.767 --> 00:54:22.601
is it responsive to that?

00:54:22.601 --> 00:54:24.267
And then a related question is,

00:54:24.267 --> 00:54:26.267
was the Google I/O
registration system

00:54:26.267 --> 00:54:29.000
running on App Engine?
D'Alesandre: [laughs]

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.000
Schalk: Um, I can't comment
on that, but...

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.934
I can--some of our slides
that we do when I--

00:54:33.934 --> 00:54:36.000
like, I regularly
give overviews--

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.000
we do cite some of our partners,
even one of our cites today,

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.000
the Royal Wedding,
where you get this...

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000
[makes launching sound]
shoot up,

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:44.934
um, so App Engine
is specifically geared

00:54:44.934 --> 00:54:46.267
to handle those types of things.
It's not--Go ahead.

00:54:46.267 --> 00:54:48.267
man: For the Royal Wedding,
though,

00:54:48.267 --> 00:54:50.267
I would imagine that it--
it didn't really shoot up.

00:54:50.267 --> 00:54:52.267
It just went kind of
over a week's time

00:54:52.267 --> 00:54:53.767
or two week's time.

00:54:53.767 --> 00:54:55.767
D'Alesandre: You'd be surprised.
It, like, of the day of,

00:54:55.767 --> 00:54:57.434
it just sort of shot up.
Schalk: Yeah, like--

00:54:57.434 --> 00:54:59.434
man: That's what I'm wondering
about--so it's able to adapt.

00:54:59.434 --> 00:55:01.501
Schalk: Yeah, and right
during the kiss, you know,

00:55:01.501 --> 00:55:04.000
those little key moments--uh,
Gigya is a partner of ours.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.000
They have sporting,
a lot of events,

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.000
that, you know, they'll
shoot up in traffic,

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.000
and then very quickly,
just drop right back down,

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000
and that's one of the key
strengths of App Engine,

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.000
that we have been touting
for a long time.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.667
D'Alesandre: And you only pay
for that traffic, right?

00:55:16.667 --> 00:55:19.334
So when it shots up,
you pay for that spike in usage,

00:55:19.334 --> 00:55:21.334
and then when it goes
down to nothing, you're...

00:55:21.334 --> 00:55:23.000
Schalk: You're gonna
lock up there.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.501
man: If I know that traffic's
gonna happen,

00:55:24.501 --> 00:55:27.000
can I somehow or other
give some indicator to say,

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000
ramp up, prepare
to ramp up for this,

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.000
or force it to instantiate more
or something?

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.334
D'Alesandre: So without going
into too much detail--

00:55:33.334 --> 00:55:36.334
so the scheduler doesn't
sort of prioritize applications

00:55:36.334 --> 00:55:38.834
against each other, um,

00:55:38.834 --> 00:55:40.834
in any visible way, so to speak.

00:55:40.834 --> 00:55:42.834
Um, what it does do,
though, is it--

00:55:42.834 --> 00:55:44.834
based on the number
of requests coming in,

00:55:44.834 --> 00:55:46.834
it figures out
how many instances

00:55:46.834 --> 00:55:48.834
that you should have
for that traffic.

00:55:48.834 --> 00:55:50.834
Um, one of the things
that we're doing

00:55:50.834 --> 00:55:52.834
in our work
on the scheduler now

00:55:52.834 --> 00:55:54.868
is essentially allowing you
to tweak that,

00:55:54.868 --> 00:55:57.834
to basically say,
"I want applications to spin up

00:55:57.834 --> 00:56:00.834
very, very quickly as soon
as traffic is coming in."

00:56:00.834 --> 00:56:02.901
And that's--
I think that's essentially

00:56:02.901 --> 00:56:04.534
what you're asking for,

00:56:04.534 --> 00:56:06.534
is the ability to do that
so that you can say,

00:56:06.534 --> 00:56:09.033
"I know there's gonna be
a lot of traffic tomorrow,

00:56:09.033 --> 00:56:10.801
so I'm gonna turn
the scheduler up to make sure

00:56:10.801 --> 00:56:13.501
that we're spinning--you're
spinning up instances quickly."

00:56:13.501 --> 00:56:15.000
man: Yeah, good.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:16.501
And you're not gonna answer
my question, though?

00:56:16.501 --> 00:56:18.000
D'Alesandre: Oh,
what was the other one?

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.501
man: Was Google I/O--
I was probably the only one

00:56:19.501 --> 00:56:21.501
that had problems
getting into the system.

00:56:21.501 --> 00:56:23.501
D'Alesandre:
So the session feedback,

00:56:23.501 --> 00:56:26.000
the speaker feedback system
is running on App Engine.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.033
man: Oh, excellent.
Schalk: Yeah.

00:56:28.033 --> 00:56:30.000
But the registration,
I'm pretty sure was--

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.501
well, not--was not, right?
Yeah, that's right,

00:56:32.501 --> 00:56:34.501
'cause I remember--
Anyway... [chuckles]

00:56:34.501 --> 00:56:36.501
Some internal discussions
about that. Sorry.

00:56:36.501 --> 00:56:38.000
man: Thank you.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.000
Murray: Hey, Chris, I'll jump
in here real quick.

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.000
Um, just as part of the spikes
you were talking about,

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.000
you know, that's something that
we experience quite a bit

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.000
with our customers.
Schalk: Oh, yeah.

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:47.801
Murray: We have these
crunch times that--

00:56:47.801 --> 00:56:50.934
where many, many companies
are trying to file their 10Q's

00:56:50.934 --> 00:56:53.434
and 10K's at once,
and, uh, you know,

00:56:53.434 --> 00:56:56.033
we've experienced
pretty smooth scaling, uh,

00:56:56.033 --> 00:56:58.534
with respect to App Engine,
but there are a couple guys

00:56:58.534 --> 00:57:01.200
sitting here in the front row--
Dave Tucker and Mike Wesner

00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:03.167
who are experts
from our company on this,

00:57:03.167 --> 00:57:05.167
and have done a lot
of statistical analysis

00:57:05.167 --> 00:57:07.167
and looking at the graphs
and charts,

00:57:07.167 --> 00:57:09.167
so I'd encourage you
to talk with them to learn

00:57:09.167 --> 00:57:11.167
a little bit more about
what we've experienced.

00:57:11.167 --> 00:57:13.667
Schalk: Cool. There you go.

00:57:13.667 --> 00:57:16.167
man: So, uh, for those
of us who have started

00:57:16.167 --> 00:57:18.167
on the App Engine only,

00:57:18.167 --> 00:57:20.167
um, and have allowed data
and no datastore,

00:57:20.167 --> 00:57:23.000
and want to switch to
the High-Replication datastore,

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.501
are you guys planning any tools
to make it easier?

00:57:25.501 --> 00:57:27.000
D'Alesandre: Absolutely.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.267
We're currently working
on tools to make that easier.

00:57:29.267 --> 00:57:31.267
Um, I-I don't know
if there's anything

00:57:31.267 --> 00:57:32.934
we can talk about today.

00:57:32.934 --> 00:57:34.934
man: Existing tools...
[speaking indistinctly]

00:57:34.934 --> 00:57:36.934
Schalk: Yeah, exactly.

00:57:36.934 --> 00:57:39.601
It's a little bit manual right
now, but yeah, definitely.

00:57:39.601 --> 00:57:41.601
We hear you on that one.

00:57:41.601 --> 00:57:44.601
D'Alesandre: And thank you
for being around from early on.

00:57:44.601 --> 00:57:46.601
Schalk: Yeah, awesome.
Good to see you again.

00:57:46.601 --> 00:57:47.934
Uh, on the right.

00:57:47.934 --> 00:57:50.934
man: Yes, I just had a question
actually on domain names

00:57:50.934 --> 00:57:52.934
for the AbsPot.com.

00:57:52.934 --> 00:57:55.934
Is, uh, we have our company name

00:57:55.934 --> 00:57:58.934
has basically been taken

00:57:58.934 --> 00:58:01.501
and used in a bunch of things
that aren't--

00:58:01.501 --> 00:58:03.501
that are just hanging
out there,

00:58:03.501 --> 00:58:06.000
and I just wonder if there's
any way you could--

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.334
or has anyone ever talked
about setting up something

00:58:08.334 --> 00:58:10.334
either reserving names,

00:58:10.334 --> 00:58:13.334
or to request getting
something back?

00:58:13.334 --> 00:58:16.334
So, like, we have Liberty Fund,

00:58:16.334 --> 00:58:19.334
and somebody has
libertyfund.abspot.com,

00:58:19.334 --> 00:58:21.334
which would be great,

00:58:21.334 --> 00:58:24.334
I think would handle some
of the SSL needs for us,

00:58:24.334 --> 00:58:26.834
but I can't get that one back
from anyone.

00:58:26.834 --> 00:58:28.834
Schalk: Interesting.
D'Alesandre: Um, so--so

00:58:28.834 --> 00:58:31.834
if that is a trademarked name...
man: Yeah.

00:58:31.834 --> 00:58:34.834
D'Alesandre: Um, uh,
let's talk afterwards--

00:58:34.834 --> 00:58:37.834
I think trade--in general,
trademark infringement

00:58:37.834 --> 00:58:39.834
is something that
we have to tackle

00:58:39.834 --> 00:58:41.868
on a sort of
case-by-case basis.

00:58:41.868 --> 00:58:44.834
man: Okay, it was more like,
you know, like, after 90 days,

00:58:44.834 --> 00:58:47.834
if they haven't--they're not
actually running anything on it,

00:58:47.834 --> 00:58:49.834
and so forth, if someone
could ask for it--

00:58:49.834 --> 00:58:51.834
at the very least, be able to
ask for the name at that point.

00:58:51.834 --> 00:58:53.501
Schalk: Yeah, makes sense.

00:58:53.501 --> 00:58:55.501
D'Alesandre: In general, no,
but, again,

00:58:55.501 --> 00:58:58.501
specifically for trademark
infringement cases. We can talk.

00:58:58.501 --> 00:59:01.567
Schalk: Yeah. So about
a minute left, but go ahead.

00:59:01.567 --> 00:59:03.567
man: That's good.
I just have a quick question.

00:59:03.567 --> 00:59:05.067
Schalk: Yeah?

00:59:05.067 --> 00:59:07.067
man: What's gonna happen
with "always on" instances

00:59:07.067 --> 00:59:08.734
with the paid apps?

00:59:08.734 --> 00:59:11.734
I noticed it's a quote of $9,
so I didn't know if that's...

00:59:11.734 --> 00:59:14.767
D'Alesandre: We're still
working on determining exactly

00:59:14.767 --> 00:59:17.734
how "always on" is gonna work
under the new model.

00:59:17.734 --> 00:59:20.834
We understand that it's--
the usefulness of it,

00:59:20.834 --> 00:59:23.334
um, and we're working

00:59:23.334 --> 00:59:26.334
to sort of fit it in
under the new pricing law.

00:59:26.334 --> 00:59:29.334
Schalk: Cool. Anyway,
so it looks like we're, uh,

00:59:29.334 --> 00:59:31.334
coming to the end
of our session here.

00:59:31.334 --> 00:59:33.834
I want to thank you guys
especially for sticking around

00:59:33.834 --> 00:59:35.834
and asking a lot
of great questions.

00:59:35.834 --> 00:59:38.567
I also want to thank our
guests--Dan from WebFilings,

00:59:38.567 --> 00:59:41.167
and Matt from Jabil, and,
of course, Greg is awesome.

00:59:41.167 --> 00:59:43.434
D'Alesandre: Thank you
very much. Thank you.
