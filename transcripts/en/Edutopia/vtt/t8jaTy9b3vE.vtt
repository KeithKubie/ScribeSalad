00:00:08.046 --> 00:00:10.036
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Okay, so let's trace
the blood through the heart.

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:11.156
Where does it come from?

00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:14.796
Superior, inferior vena cava.

00:00:14.796 --> 00:00:15.656
Coming from the where?

00:00:15.976 --> 00:00:17.156
The body, right?

00:00:17.156 --> 00:00:18.326
And then it enters the what?

00:00:18.616 --> 00:00:21.396
The right atrium.

00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:24.706
&gt;&gt;Narrator: This class at South Grand
Prairie High School near Arlington,

00:00:24.706 --> 00:00:28.066
Texas looks like a
typical biology class,

00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:29.976
but for many of these students,

00:00:29.976 --> 00:00:36.956
failing or passing this course
can be a matter of life or death.

00:00:36.956 --> 00:00:37.396
[ Siren wails ]

00:00:37.396 --> 00:00:41.376
&gt;&gt;Narrator: On a cold, rainy morning,
members of the EMT class respond

00:00:41.376 --> 00:00:42.926
to an accident near their school.

00:00:43.046 --> 00:00:44.816
&gt;&gt;Student: Go ahead and get
a C-collar and a backboard.

00:00:45.046 --> 00:00:47.806
&gt;&gt;Narrator: While the injuries
aren't real, the hands-on learning

00:00:47.806 --> 00:00:50.606
that happens here makes
an everlasting impression.

00:00:51.056 --> 00:00:53.096
&gt;&gt;Stephanie: When we first
got out there, I was nervous.

00:00:53.456 --> 00:00:55.286
I made the mistake of going
around the truck instead

00:00:55.286 --> 00:00:57.276
of going straight to the stretcher.

00:00:57.476 --> 00:00:59.806
I actually followed them, and
I got there and I'm like, "Oh,

00:00:59.856 --> 00:01:00.976
I'm supposed to be somewhere else."

00:01:01.046 --> 00:01:04.156
&gt;&gt;On three.

00:01:04.956 --> 00:01:06.976
One, two, three.

00:01:07.056 --> 00:01:08.126
&gt;&gt;Stephanie: We learn a
lot through repetition.

00:01:08.276 --> 00:01:11.616
It's great because if we mess up
on something, like if we're going

00:01:11.616 --> 00:01:14.746
through a scene and we mess
up, they're able to critique us

00:01:14.826 --> 00:01:17.776
and we find out what we messed
up on and we learn from that.

00:01:18.016 --> 00:01:18.536
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Okay, so what
kind of patient is that?

00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:19.646
Is that a stay-and-play
or a load-and-go?

00:01:19.676 --> 00:01:19.976
&gt;&gt;Load-and-go.

00:01:20.096 --> 00:01:22.236
&gt;&gt;Load-and-go, and that's
what she did, right?

00:01:22.586 --> 00:01:24.536
She got there, she did her
quick assessment, all right?

00:01:24.536 --> 00:01:27.406
Okay? And you got your group
out, you put her on a backboard,

00:01:27.406 --> 00:01:28.206
and you got her in the ambulance.

00:01:28.286 --> 00:01:29.736
Why was that so important to you?

00:01:30.046 --> 00:01:30.526
&gt;&gt;It's cold outside.

00:01:30.606 --> 00:01:31.976
She was shivering, and
she needed to be inside.

00:01:32.046 --> 00:01:32.226
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Good.

00:01:32.346 --> 00:01:33.976
Very good assessment.

00:01:34.046 --> 00:01:36.926
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The EMT program is
part of the Health Science Academy,

00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:40.506
one of five academy options for
students at South Grand Prairie.

00:01:40.776 --> 00:01:44.326
They can prepare for college and
careers in everything from accounting

00:01:44.746 --> 00:01:48.186
to art to engineering and law.

00:01:48.266 --> 00:01:50.626
&gt;&gt;I will be representing
the prosecution.

00:01:51.286 --> 00:01:54.916
&gt;&gt;Roy: What we found out is that we
weren't successful with 60 percent

00:01:54.916 --> 00:01:58.306
of the students, that, yes, they were
graduating, yes, they were moving

00:01:58.306 --> 00:02:02.326
on to life after high school, but
not at the level that we would

00:02:02.326 --> 00:02:05.866
like to see them, so we decided
that old phrase "what's good

00:02:05.866 --> 00:02:08.586
for one is good for all" and
go to wall-to-wall academies

00:02:08.586 --> 00:02:12.426
for all 2,500 students to give each
and every one of them an opportunity

00:02:12.736 --> 00:02:16.406
to explore, to experiment, to find
out what they wanted to do, and, yes,

00:02:16.406 --> 00:02:19.966
to find out what perhaps they didn't
want to do after they're graduated.

00:02:20.046 --> 00:02:22.796
&gt;&gt;Stephanie: It's great being in
an academy because you get to learn

00:02:22.796 --> 00:02:24.906
with the people that want
to do the same thing.

00:02:25.486 --> 00:02:29.606
Like being in a big school, people
may distract the class of not wanting

00:02:29.606 --> 00:02:32.626
to be there, but when you're in
academy, everyone wants to be

00:02:32.626 --> 00:02:34.976
in that academy and
you're able to learn more.

00:02:35.106 --> 00:02:35.696
&gt;&gt;Good job.

00:02:35.856 --> 00:02:37.016
Let's do it again.

00:02:37.016 --> 00:02:39.056
&gt;&gt;Chad: I will teach you all
the medicine you want to learn,

00:02:39.506 --> 00:02:41.766
but the biggest thing I want to
teach you is critical thinking,

00:02:41.766 --> 00:02:43.396
how you can think in
a critical setting.

00:02:43.396 --> 00:02:45.036
And they take that everywhere.

00:02:45.036 --> 00:02:47.616
They take that out when they
go out partying that night.

00:02:48.116 --> 00:02:48.676
&gt;&gt;Charles: All right, guys.

00:02:48.676 --> 00:02:49.186
What do we got?

00:02:49.236 --> 00:02:50.916
&gt;&gt;Student: We have an
18-year-old female.

00:02:50.966 --> 00:02:52.976
Her initial BP was 130/70.

00:02:53.086 --> 00:02:55.356
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Most of the
academies invite professionals,

00:02:55.356 --> 00:02:58.956
like flight paramedic Chuck
Skinner, to volunteer as mentors.

00:02:58.956 --> 00:03:00.656
&gt;&gt;Student: She was A and
O times 3 at that point

00:03:00.656 --> 00:03:01.816
and respirations were still 18.

00:03:02.246 --> 00:03:03.226
&gt;&gt;Charles: Kids in high school tend

00:03:03.226 --> 00:03:05.606
to be pretty good test takers
we could give the book to

00:03:05.606 --> 00:03:07.896
and they could pass the final exam.

00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:08.656
That's the truth.

00:03:09.076 --> 00:03:11.066
They would suck as EMTs.

00:03:11.276 --> 00:03:12.956
They would not be employable.

00:03:13.406 --> 00:03:15.806
&gt;&gt;Student: We're going to put
you onto the helicopter, okay?

00:03:15.806 --> 00:03:17.576
It's going to be very loud, but
everything is going to be okay.

00:03:17.576 --> 00:03:19.786
&gt;&gt;Charles: The bottom line is, we
have to motivate them to care enough

00:03:20.256 --> 00:03:23.836
to actually want to apply these
skills to someone who's bleeding,

00:03:24.076 --> 00:03:27.666
to someone who's drunk and
behaving badly from a head injury.

00:03:28.206 --> 00:03:30.706
&gt;&gt;Student: We treated her for
a possible tib-fib fracture--

00:03:31.456 --> 00:03:33.966
&gt;&gt;Charles: Rather than this
pie-in-the-sky kind of education

00:03:33.966 --> 00:03:36.426
where we all hold hands, sing
"Kumbayah" and read soccer tees,

00:03:36.426 --> 00:03:39.876
we actually are talking about
stuff that matters today.

00:03:40.006 --> 00:03:42.126
I mean, they'll come out of
school ready to go to work.

00:03:42.156 --> 00:03:43.976
We have jobs waiting
for some of these guys.

00:03:44.356 --> 00:03:46.696
&gt;&gt;I don't recommend you have
your stethoscope around your neck

00:03:46.906 --> 00:03:47.826
because when you're down like this,

00:03:47.826 --> 00:03:49.466
they're going to be
hanging in your patient.

00:03:50.046 --> 00:03:53.296
&gt;&gt;Narrator: If they do well in the
course and pass a battery of tests,

00:03:53.296 --> 00:03:57.966
students can graduate as certified
emergency medical technicians.

00:03:58.076 --> 00:03:59.766
&gt;&gt;Charles: If you can catch folks
that are very good at this type

00:03:59.766 --> 00:04:02.776
of hands-on learning early on, not
only can you save them the grief

00:04:02.776 --> 00:04:06.366
of spending two decades trying
to find their career, i.e. me,

00:04:07.096 --> 00:04:11.416
but you plug in young, vibrant,
healthy folks into a system

00:04:11.416 --> 00:04:14.946
that really needs and requires
that kind of physicality,

00:04:15.236 --> 00:04:16.966
you improve the system for everybody.

00:04:17.146 --> 00:04:20.096
&gt;&gt;If you all lead us down the
wrong path in your assessment,

00:04:20.336 --> 00:04:23.106
you understand, we're going to
go down that path until we figure

00:04:23.106 --> 00:04:25.336
out "Ruh-roh, Shaggy,"
we got a problem.

00:04:25.336 --> 00:04:29.096
"Ruh-roh," and in the air, it
is a much more serious problem,

00:04:29.096 --> 00:04:30.826
so we depend on your assessment.

00:04:31.496 --> 00:04:33.916
&gt;&gt;Ma'am, do you have any other pain?

00:04:33.916 --> 00:04:33.983
&gt;&gt;No.

00:04:34.046 --> 00:04:36.056
&gt;&gt;Shawnda: Being able to know what
I'm doing and actually be able

00:04:36.316 --> 00:04:39.866
to take charge and do it, it really
makes me happy, because if you think

00:04:39.866 --> 00:04:42.856
about it, if that's a real
patient, you saved their life.

00:04:42.856 --> 00:04:43.956
I mean, you were a part of that.

00:04:43.956 --> 00:04:48.066
You got to save their life, if,
of course, they live, but, I mean,

00:04:48.316 --> 00:04:52.146
you help them and you get to help
them and it's just so much fun.

00:04:52.386 --> 00:04:53.946
&gt;&gt;Do a rapid trauma assessment.

00:04:54.736 --> 00:04:58.816
&gt;&gt;Debra: The data that we've seen
over the time since we've gone

00:04:58.816 --> 00:05:02.626
to career academies has shown that
our kids are being more successful.

00:05:02.876 --> 00:05:07.136
The fact that the parents come to our
parent meetings, in droves, actually,

00:05:07.136 --> 00:05:10.936
and say, "My kid is really
loving that EMT class."

00:05:11.266 --> 00:05:15.356
"My kid is really enjoying studying
something that means something."

00:05:16.276 --> 00:05:17.646
&gt;&gt;Good job, guys.

00:05:17.876 --> 00:05:18.226
Good job.

00:05:19.266 --> 00:05:21.306
