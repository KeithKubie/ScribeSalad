00:00:05.794 --> 00:00:07.460
PROFESSOR BLADE
KOTELLY: I think the way

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.480
that we open their thinking
in the process of teaching

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.660
it is to start connecting our
process to everything else they

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:15.479
do in life.

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:17.520
So start to really make
sure that they understand

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.240
the connections between the
design process being used

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.090
for something as
simple as planning

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.770
a birthday party to something
more complicated, like making

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.950
a mechanical system, designing
a phone, or something like that.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.220
We try to have them reflect on
it in their normal existence.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.535
So, do a design
critique of something,

00:00:36.535 --> 00:00:37.660
and come back in with that.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.190
So we can actually
have them think

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.130
about oh, the design
of a simple object

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.210
in my life, what
do I like about it?

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.334
What don't I like about it?

00:00:43.334 --> 00:00:46.910
And then they start thinking
a little bit differently,

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.950
because they realize that
all the ideas they've

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.140
had about certainty,
these principles

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.587
are true-- they realize,
well, they aren't always true.

00:00:59.587 --> 00:01:01.170
In fact, they're
only true in context.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.753
PROFESSOR JOEL
SCHINDALL: Part of what

00:01:02.753 --> 00:01:06.300
we do in the class is to
ask provocative questions.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.890
Students will give
an answer that they

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.140
think is the normal
answer to the question.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.570
And Blade will say,
why do you think that?

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.850
The students are a
little irritated.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.370
I think that because that's
the right thing to think.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.734
But it turns out that it's not
the only way to look at it.

00:01:23.734 --> 00:01:25.150
And they simply
haven't challenged

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.590
that way of looking at.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.240
And sometimes we have to
walk a little fine line

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.490
to not be too
irritating with this.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.150
But the fact is, the irritation
provokes the expanded

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.790
exploration, the sensitivity
to things around them,

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.791
which is what we want to
draw out in this class.

00:01:44.791 --> 00:01:46.790
PROFESSOR BLADE KOTELLY:
Some of the other goals

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.060
include just doing a
really clean, simple design

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.800
process they can
apply to anything.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.900
Being able to operate
as a designer does.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.970
So in the context of
whatever they're doing,

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.110
know how to evaluate systems.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.430
Thinking about people.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.555
Understanding stakeholders.

00:02:01.555 --> 00:02:04.096
Understanding a little bit about
the architecture of a system

00:02:04.096 --> 00:02:05.680
and how to abstract it out.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.639
Understanding how to
write good requirements.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:11.440
Being able to usability
test something

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.040
to see if someone actually can
use it, they like using it.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.160
Understanding the psychology
of human interaction

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.130
with technology is
really important.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.372
Being able to think that
the brand of something

00:02:22.372 --> 00:02:24.080
actually affects the
way someone uses it.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.990
It's not just the logo
or something else,

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.137
but the way the whole system
feels and the identity it

00:02:29.137 --> 00:02:30.720
produces in the mind
of someone that's

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.300
unique compared
to other systems.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.616
And hopefully they're able
to see all this whenever

00:02:37.616 --> 00:02:38.490
they create anything.

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:45.660
PROFESSOR JOEL SCHINDALL:
Blade had previous experience

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.160
when we put the course
together in speech-activated

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.910
satisfaction systems,
or answering systems.

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.920
There's no easy name for it
in the language, or at least

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.990
I'm missing it, but when you
call American Airlines to get

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.370
information about a flight, or
when you call to order a pizza,

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.130
you'll often interact with an
automated voice system which

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.770
gives you certain prompts,
listens to your responses,

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.160
and based on those responses
it gives you other prompts.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.590
Most people find them
very exasperating,

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.710
because somehow they don't
seem to be foreseeing correctly

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.860
the issue that
you're dealing with.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.670
And so we have the
students design systems.

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.230
Initially, we have them
design a simple pizza ordering

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.310
system or simple banking
transaction system,

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.500
but then as their
project for the term,

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.820
they will do a more
complicated system.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.430
Something like, one
of them did a system--

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.970
I forget the exact name--
but it was for a parent

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.150
to let a child call this
automated system and it would

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.850
say, "Hi, this is Santa's elf.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.580
And what would you like
for Christmas this year?"

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.600
And the child will
respond with what

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.420
it would like to
get for Christmas.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.720
And the system is prompted
to listen for things

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.150
and it will record the
child's answer, say

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.060
that's a wonderful thing,
we'll see what we can do.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.060
And then the system
actually will call or text

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.570
the child's parent to
tell the child's parent

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.410
what the child asked
for for Christmas.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.770
It was a very
clever idea, and it

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.200
was implemented in such a
way that people who used it

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.700
actually had fun and
enjoyed the answers.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.850
The challenge for
the students is

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.930
that you'd think that designing
a speech-activated system

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.560
is an easy thing to do.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.670
And you quickly get
humbled by the fact

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.760
that the first person
who you have try it

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.280
comes up with a perfectly
logical response that

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.200
is not what you had predicted.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.590
And it forces you to
get into the user's head

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.230
and look at what do
I need to provide

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.320
the user in the
way of information

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.700
and what responses do I need
to be prepared to respond to,

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.700
so that I can have an effective
dialogue with this user?

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.010
It's a wonderful way of
training the students

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.980
in how to be methodical,
how to put together a plan,

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.670
how to engineer something,
but how to also test it

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.125
with users and deal
with the issues that

00:05:21.125 --> 00:05:23.260
come up with those users.
